    "it is inferred through various observations that the magnetic field is playing a central role in the solar energetics that take place in the higher layers of the atmosphere ( see for eg .",
    "but , it is somewhat difficult to obtain a reliable vector magnetic field measurements at the chromosphere and corona @xcite .",
    "the measurements of the photospheric magnetic fields are relatively well established .",
    "however , simultaneous vector magnetic field observations at the photospheric and chromospheric heights will give a better handle on the understanding of the magnetic structuring of the solar atmosphere .",
    "more direct and reliable measurements of the magnetic field at the chromosphere will also serve as a better boundary condition for extrapolating the magnetic fields to the coronal heights .",
    "measurements of the vector magnetic field in @xmath1 is particularly important in understanding the connection between photospheric , chromospheric and coronal magnetic field as its height of formation ranges almost from the upper photosphere to upper chromosphere @xcite .",
    "also , this is one of the most widely used spectral lines for the study of solar chromosphere ( see a recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "comparison of the active region magnetic fields measured in @xmath1 and in the photosphere show a one - to - one correspondence in the weak field regions .",
    "but in the strong field regions , like umbra , there is a considerable deviation from the linearity @xcite .",
    "infact the los magnetic field measured in @xmath1 weakens much faster for the corresponding strong field regions of the photosphere . at this point",
    "it may not be appropriate to demarcate the field strength above which this deviation happens because different observations show different deviation points .",
    "@xcite have also reported the systematic weakening of the magnetic field derived from mg i @xmath5 lines in comparison with that of fe i @xmath6 lines . in their case ,",
    "the magnetic field measured by mg i lines agree with the potential field extrapolation of the photospheric los magnetic field in weak field regime . in strong field regions",
    "there is a systematic shift towards lower values but still linear .",
    "simultaneous observations of he i at @xmath7 and si i lines at @xmath8 by @xcite suggest that the field diverges faster in the upper layers of the chromosphere .",
    "however there is no conclusive explanation for the observed weaker chromospheric magnetic fields for the corresponding strong photospheric fields .",
    "various possibilities have been discussed by @xcite & @xcite about weaker chromospheric fields observed in umbra . @xcite",
    "have discussed the possibility of scattered light and/or peculiarity of the atmosphere ( radiative transfer effects ) for the decrease in the polarization signal which in turn cause the underestimation of the magnetic field . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the strongest fields measured at the photosphere diverge spatially and more quickly than the weak fields when propagating upward . in this paper , we address these issues from the point of view of the observed velocity gradients .    it is well known that , velocities and magnetic fields are coupled to each other in the solar atmosphere ( see for eg .",
    "any change in the magnetic field is expected to alter the plasma motion and hence the observed velocity .",
    "if the field strength decreases with height then the velocity is expected to increase and vice versa , for the simple reason that the inhibition of the plasma depends on the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the magnetic field strength in the umbral region at the photosphere is large . if the magnetic field measured with @xmath1 in the umbral region",
    "is weaker , then it shows that the magnetic field gradient is larger than expected which implies larger velocity gradients in the umbral region compared to the penumbral region at chromospheric heights . in order to observationally verify this",
    "we have analyzed the velocity and magnetic fields estimated from the simultaneous spectropolarimetric observations of an active region using @xmath1 and fe i spectral lines .",

    "spectropolarimetric observations were carried out using a newly added dual beam polarimeter to the spectrograph at kodaikanal solar telescope ( @xcite and also see @xcite for details about the spectrograph and telescope setup ) .",
    "the wavelength region of the observations presented in this paper includes @xmath9 and fe i ( @xmath0 ) lines .",

    "the measured instrumental broadening and the linear dispersion close to this wavelength region in second order of diffraction are @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the wavelength calibration was done using the telluric lines ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "an eight stage modulation scheme was used for the measurement of the general state of polarization @xcite . in this modulation scheme the measurement of the stokes parameters",
    "are well balanced over the duration of eight stages of intensity measurements .",
    "the rotation of the retarders were done manually for the modulation of the input light .",
    "the spectropolarimetric data of an active region noaa0875 presented in this paper were obtained on 28th april , 2006 .",
    "the heliographic coordinates of the sunspot during observations were @xmath16 south and @xmath17 west .",
    "scanning of the sunspot was done by moving the sun s image in an east - west direction in steps of @xmath18 . for each slit position ,",

    "eight stages of modulation took about @xmath21 s with a typical exposure time of @xmath22 s.",

    "model independent velocity and magnetic field gradients can be derived from the bisector technique for the range of heights over which the spectral line is formed , provided the full spectral profile is available without any blend @xcite .",
    "the application of bisector technique to @xmath1 is restricted because of the blend in its red wing by the zeeman sensitive co i ( @xmath23 ) line which forms at the photospheric heights . in the following section",
    "we discuss the procedure to remove this blend and its limitations .",
    "individual profiles of @xmath1 corresponding to the orthogonally polarized beams in each stage of modulation were considered for removing the blend . a function which is a linear combination of a gaussian and a quadratic term",
    "was fitted to the blend region of the observed @xmath1 profile .",
    "this non - linear least square fit ( available in idl ) takes into account the curvature in the intensity profile of @xmath1 line along with the co i line profile approximated as a gaussian .",
    "the gaussian , constructed out of the fitted parameters , was removed from the observed profile .",
    "then the eight intensity measurements were combined to obtain stokes @xmath24 and @xmath25 spectral images through the demodulation procedure explained in @xcite . a typical @xmath1 intensity profile before and after the blend removal is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blendrem ] with the bisectors marked as diamond symbols .",
    "even though it appears in the total intensity profile that the effect of co i line is completely removed , the blend residuals still appear in stokes @xmath26 , and @xmath25 profiles .",
    "the residuals are due to the gaussian approximation used for the co  i line profile .",
    "however , it is demonstrated in the section [ sect : velgrad ] that the blend residuals do not have any effect on the velocity gradients calculated from the @xmath1 intensity profiles .",
    "the better way to remove the blend may be to synthesise the stokes profiles of co i using radiative transfer equations along with the atmospheric parameters obtained through fe i ( @xmath0 ) line .",
    "however in this paper only stokes @xmath4 profiles are considered for the velocity gradients estimation and a restricted spectral range of @xmath1 about line center for the los magnetic field estimation .",
    "hence , the simple blend removal method outlined in this paper is found to be sufficient .",
    "the polarimetric data was corrected for polarimeter response ( for details see @xcite ) . the instrumental polarization introduced by the telescope",
    "was corrected by using the telescope model developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the refractive index values for aluminium coating used in the model are obtained from the catalog @xcite .",
    "since these values may be different from the actual values , there still remain residual cross - talks among stokes parameters .",
    "these residual cross - talks are removed by the statistical method given in @xcite .",
    "the los magnetic fields at the photospheric and chromospheric heights are derived using the fe i line and @xmath1 respectively . for the derivation of the los magnetic fields ,",
    "center - of - gravity ( cog ) method was used @xcite .    for the cog method ,",
    "the los field strength is given by    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the central wavelength of the line in @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the land@xmath10 ` g ' factor of the line , and @xmath31 are the cog wavelengths of the positive and negative circularly polarized components respectively .",
    "the cog components are calculated as    @xmath32 \\lambda d\\lambda }                       { \\int i_{cont } - ( i \\pm v)d\\lambda}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 is the local continuum intensity . the integration is over the spectral range of a given spectral line .",
    "since fe i line is free of blend , the full spectral range is available for the cog method . for the @xmath1 line",
    ", the spectral range is restricted due to the blending of the zeeman sensitive co i line . even though the blend is removed in stokes @xmath4 profile using the gaussian fit technique explained in the section ( [ sect : blendrem ] ) , there still remains a residual in polarization profiles . to avoid introducing any artifacts in the los magnetic field values derived using cog method ,",
    "a restricted spectral range about the @xmath1 line core is used .",
    "this spectral region was selected by looking at the strongest stokes @xmath25 signal of co i line .",
    "hence the derived los magnetic field using @xmath1 would correspond mostly to the upper chromosphere @xcite .",
    "the expected maximum underestimation of the photopsheric los magnetic field is about @xmath34 for the kind of field strengths presented in this paper . because of the large intrinsic doppler width of @xmath1 , the underestimation of the los field",
    "is not expected even for the strongest magnetic field observed at the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "however we checked the reliability of the cog method in deriving los field from @xmath1 by applying it to synthetic stokes @xmath4 and @xmath25 profiles of @xmath1 obtained using the radiative transfer code of @xcite . from these studies",
    "it was found that the cog method overestimates the los field by about @xmath35 in the field strength range 0 to 2000 g. however , the main error involved in the determination of the los magnetic field , for this observation , is due to the error in estimating the shifts between the cog wavelength positions @xmath36 and @xmath37 which is expected to be less than 70 g.      the strength and the orientation of the chromospheric magnetic field are very much dependent on its vector nature at the photosphere ( @xcite and references there in ) .",
    "inference of the vector magnetic field at the chromosphere from the @xmath1 observations is difficult because , stokes @xmath38 and @xmath39 are hardly discernible . only at few locations of penumbra they are above the noise level ( @xmath40 in our observations ) .",
    "hence for the correct interpretation of the los magnetic field obtained from @xmath1 it is important to have the complete information about the vector magnetic field at the photosphere .",
    "the photospheric vector magnetic fields are obtained by inverting the observed stokes profiles of fe i line .",
    "milne - eddington line analysis using a numerical inversion engine ( melanie ) was used to perform the inversion .",
    "melanie performs non - linear least - square fitting of the observed stokes profiles under local - thermodynamic - equilibrium ( lte ) condition by assuming milne - eddington atmosphere .",
    "inversion code returns magnetic field strength , inclination angle with respect to los , azimuth , line strength , damping parameter , los velocity , source function and its gradient with optical depth , macroturbulence and fraction of stray light / fill factor of the non - magnetic component .",
    "the fit error in estimating the magnetic field ranges from @xmath41 g for the stokes profiles which are symmetric and well above the noise level to @xmath42 g for the stokes profiles which are highly asymmetric and close to noise level .",
    "the maximum fit error in the estimation of the field orientation is about @xmath43 and its azimuth is @xmath44 .",
    "other physical parameters returned by the melanie are not used in the current work and hence are not discussed here .",
    "the measurement of the magnetic field in @xmath1 has been difficult to interpret @xcite .",
    "however it is possible to address some of these difficulties from the study of plasma motions as magnetic field and plasma motion influence one another in the solar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "hence the study of velocity and its gradient may help in better interpretation of the observed magnetic field .",
    "the velocities at the photosphere and chromosphere are obtained through cog method @xcite .",
    "the cog wavelength @xmath45 of a line profile @xmath4 is defined as the centroid of its residual intensity profile : @xmath46 the los velocity with respect to the average quiet sun reference ( @xmath47 ) is defined as @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the speed of the light .",
    "bisector technique has been applied to stokes @xmath4 profiles to derive the velocity gradients both at the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "the stokes @xmath4 profiles of fe i and @xmath1 are separately considered for bisector analysis .",
    "bisectors are obtained at 9 equal intensity levels between line core and the wing for fe i and 14 equal intensity levels between line core and wing for @xmath1 respectively . out of 9 bisectors of fe",
    "i line only 7 are considered , namely , the bisectors between second and eighth counting from the line core . similarly for @xmath1 the bisectors between second and thirteenth are considered totalling 12 bisectors .",
    "the bisectors very close to line core and wing are not considered because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio and to avoid the influence of the continuum respectively .",
    "for the fe i line , the wavelength position of the second bisector which corresponds to higher atmospheric layer was subtracted from the seventh bisector which corresponds to lower atmospheric layer .",
    "similarly for @xmath1 , the wavelength position of the second bisector was subtracted from the thirteenth bisector .",
    "the wavelength differences ( @xmath50s ) thus obtained are converted into velocities - which would then represent the velocity difference between the lower and higher atmospheric layers - using the following relation , @xmath51 where @xmath28 is the rest wavelength of the spectral line under consideration . the velocity difference defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : veldifbisec ] ) represents the velocity gradient over the line formation height .    the errors in estimating the velocity differences are mainly due to the errors involved in finding the wavelength shifts .",
    "the maximum error in estimating the velocity gradients is about @xmath52 km s@xmath53 .",
    "amplitude and area asymmetries of stokes @xmath25 profiles are caused by the gradients in the velocity and magnetic fields ( see for eg .",
    "hence their analysis will give us some handle on the understanding of the field gradients .",
    "if @xmath54 and @xmath55 represent the amplitudes of red and blue wings of stokes @xmath25 respectively then the amplitude asymmetry is defined as ,    @xmath56    the area asymmetry is not considered in this paper due to the difficulty in estimating it for the @xmath1 in the presence of co i line blend .",
    "the scatter plot of los magnetic field derived from @xmath1 and fe i is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:28fld ] .",
    "the plot shows that the chromospheric magnetic field is weaker in general compared to its photospheric counterpart .",
    "the important point to note from this figure is that the chromospheric fields are much weaker in the locations where the strong photospheric fields are observed . similar kind of observations were reported earlier by @xcite using simultaneous observations in @xmath1 and fe i line at @xmath57 and @xcite who compared the los field measured in @xmath1 with the magnetograms of soho / mdi .",
    "these observations may imply that the stronger fields weaken much faster when they propagate upward in the solar atmosphere .    to illustrate the quicker weakening of the stronger fields , plots of the photospheric and",
    "the chromospheric los field strengths along two different radial slices of the sunspot are shown on the right side of the fig .",
    "the radial slices considered for this purpose are marked as 1 and 2 on the soho / mdi intensitygram showing the sunspot analysed in this paper .",
    "5 arc sec ) , the raster images do not give a good representation of the observed region and also there was no imaging facility available during these observations and therefore intensitygram from soho / mdi is used .",
    "the radial cuts marked on the image represent the approximate slit positions of the observations .",
    "] the top panel on the right side of the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the plots of photospheric and chomospheric los magnetic field strengths along the radial cut ( marked as 1 on the sunspot image ) passing close to the central umbra .",
    "note that , along this radial cut the photospheric field strength increases systematically from the penumbral region to the umbral region . while the chromospheric field strength increases upto about 800 g , more or less linear with the photospheric field , and then starts decreasing towards the umbra .",
    "the decrease in the chromospheric field is much larger close to central umbra .",
    "the photospheric field along the radial cut 2 as shown in the bottom panel on the right side of the fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the behavior very similar to that was seen along the radial cut 1 .",
    "that means the photospheric field strength is larger in the umbral region and decreases towards the edges of the sunspot . in the case of chromospheric field strength , the values do not decrease towards the umbra as was seen for the radial cut 1 but , they are considerably smaller compared to its photospheric counter part .",
    "the main difference between these two radial cuts is that the field strength in the umbral photosphere for radial cut 1 is larger compared to that of radial cut 2 .",
    "this may be an indication of the faster divergence of the stronger fields .",
    "however , there are other possibilities which can cause this observed weaker fields in the umbral chromosphere and they are : weakening of the polarization signal due to scattered light within the instrument and from nearby quiet sun ; peculiarity of the atmosphere such as discussed by @xcite ; the methods used to derive los magnetic field ( inversion of @xmath1 stokes profiles is yet to be established ) ; inclination of the magnetic field ; and most importantly the height of formation which is highly ambiguous @xcite .",
    "we will discuss these issues in detail after looking at the results from the analysis of velocity gradients both at the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "the velocities calculated using cog method show a typical behavior of evershed flows both at the photosphere and chromosphere .",
    "that means the limb side penumbra shows red shift with respect to quiet sun where as center side penumbra shows blue shift at the photospheric heights .",
    "the situation is exactly opposite at chromospheric heights which are consistent with the well known inverse evershed effect .",
    "cog velocities in umbral regions both at photosphere and chromosphere are smaller compared to penumbral regions .    the plots of bisector velocity differences ( eq .",

    "top panel in this figure is for all the points over the total field of view ( fov ) , where as the bottom left and right panel is for umbral and penumbral regions of the observed spot , respectively .",
    "note from these figures that the large number of points correspond to umbra have smaller velocity gradients than the penumbra .",
    "closer investigation of bisector velocity differences of fe i line show the flow pattern consistent with the well known evershed flow .",
    "that means larger portion of the limb side penumbra shows net downflow ( both core and wing side bisectors show redshifts ) and disk center side penumbra shows net upflow ( both core and wing bisectors show blue shifts with respect to the reference ) . for the definition of the net up- and down - flow see @xcite .",
    "we also found that the bisector velocity gradients and cog velocities observed in fe i show a good correlation in agreement with the earlier observations .",
    "that means , larger the cog velocity larger the velocity gradient at the photosphere .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgradhalpha_full ] the plots of bisector velocity gradients for @xmath1 v / s the photospheric magnetic fields are shown .",
    "top panel in this figure is for the total fov and left bottom panel for umbral region and right bottom panel for penumbral region .",
    "notice the increase in bisector velocity gradients measured in @xmath1 with increase in the photospheric magnetic field strength .",
    "plots of velocity gradients along two radial slices of sunspot ( marked as 1 and 2 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) also show that the larger velocity gradients at the chromosphere are located at which strong photospheric fields are observed ( fig .",

    "the corresponding plots of velocity gradients are shown in the bottom panels .",
    "except at few locations ( mostly in the limb side penumbra such as shown in the bottom right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) which show less variation in the values of velocity gradients inspite of variation in the photospheric field strengths ( which is evident also in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgradhalpha_full ] ) , most of the places the velocity gradients are larger where the photospheric magnetic field strengths are larger .",
    "closer examination of the bisector wavelength positions of @xmath1 stokes @xmath4 profiles in different regions of the sunspot with respect to the reference wavelength reveals the following results ( see figure [ fig : comprbisec ] ) .",
    "* in the limb side penumbra both line core and wing side bisectors show blue shift with respect to quiet sun .",
    "the shifts in the line core bisectors are large compared to the line wing bisectors indicating the net upflow .",
    "* in the umbral region also both line core side and wing side bisectors show blue shifts with respect to the reference wavelength .",
    "the shifts in the line core side bisectors for the umbra are almost comparable to that of the limb side penumbra",
    ". however , the shifts in the line wing side bisectors for the umbra are much smaller with respect to that of the limb side penumbra .",
    "this would indicate again the net upflows but with larger velocity gradients .",
    "* in the center side penumbra the line wing bisectors show redshift in most of the places with respect to the quiet sun . at few locations",
    "they show a small blue shift or no shift .",
    "the line core side bisectors show slight blue shift with respect to quiet sun reference wavelength position .    it is found through these analyses that the velocity gradients are larger in the umbra at the chromospheric heights compared to the penumbra ( see fig . [",
    "fig : vgradhalpha_full ] ) . which is exactly in contrast with the flow pattern observed at the photosphere .",
    "the analysis of bisector velocity differences also indicate accelerated upflows in the umbral region .",
    "there is a little concern due to the residuals present after the co i line blend is removed . to make sure that there are no artifacts introduced due to the residuals , the bisector velocity differences calculated by considering the spectral region of the line which is not affected by the blend are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vgradhalpha_part ] as a function of photospheric field strength .",
    "this figure also shows the trend that the velocity gradients increase with increase in photospheric magnetic field strength confirming the observations made with the blend removed full intensity profiles .",
    "as expected , the gradients are smaller due to the smaller wavelength regions considered in this case .    to summarise , wavelength shifts analysis of stokes @xmath4 bisectors show that the velocity gradients are larger in the umbral region than in the penumbral region at the chromospheric heights .",
    "most importantly , accelerated upflows are observed in the umbral region . in other words , los velocity increases upward more rapidly in the umbral region than in the penumbral region at the chromosphere .",
    "let us now address some of the possibilities , mentioned in the beginning of this section , which can cause the observed weaker chromospheric field in the umbral region from the point of view of the velocity gradients .",
    "we found that the stray light within the instrument is less than @xmath58 by comparing the quiet sun spectrum with the atlas @xcite .",
    "this amount of stray light is too small to account for the observed weaker stokes @xmath25 signals in the umbral region .",
    "also , it can not account for the observed velocity gradients in @xmath1 .",
    "the next question raised was about the reliability of the methods used to estimate the los magnetic field . despite the availability of more accurate estimation of photospheric magnetic field through inversion",
    ", we have used the cog method to maintain the uniformity while comparing the los field at the photosphere and chromosphere ( fig .",
    "[ fig:28fld ] ) .",
    "this is because the inversion of @xmath1 profiles to derive magnetic field is yet to be established .",
    "as discussed in section [ sect : losb ] the underestimation of the los field obtained from fe i is expected to be more while the values obtained from @xmath1 will be less as confirmed through numerical simulations .",
    "also , the observed umbral fields are larger at the photosphere where as they are smaller at the chromosphere .",
    "hence the departure of los magnetic fields from the actual values due to the method used to estimate them can not explain the observed weakening of the magnetic fields .",
    "one of the possibilities which can cause the reduction in polarization ( in effect the weaker magnetic field ) proposed by @xcite is the peculiarity of the atmosphere .",
    "however , the kind of peculiarity discussed by him can not explain the velocity gradients and the stokes profiles of @xmath1 discussed in this paper .",
    "it is a general wisdom gained from the extrapolation technique that the magnetic topology at the chromosphere is very much dependent on the field configuration at the photosphere .",
    "extrapolation techniques like potential field approximation suggest that larger the field inclination at the photosphere chromospheic fields should also show larger inclination .",
    "from the inversion of fe i line it was found that the fields are oriented more close to los in the umbral region than in the penumbral region .",
    "hence we expect larger field orientation in penumbral region at the chromospheric heights also .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sect : vmag : photo ] @xmath1 shows stokes @xmath38 and @xmath39 signals which are above the noise level in penumbral region but not in umbral region indicating that the orientation of the fields are larger in the penumbral region compared to the umbral region even at the chromosphere . hence we believe that the weaker los field observed in the umbral region may not be due to the larger orientation angle with respect to the los .",
    "this scenario is also verified using the velocity gradients observed at the chromosphere , as larger inclination means smaller los velocity in contradiction to the observed velocities ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vgradhalpha_full ] ) .",
    "another major difficulty in interpreting the @xmath1 observations is the ambiguity in its height of formation .",
    "studies based on the response functions by @xcite show that the @xmath1 is sensitive mostly to chromospheric magnetic field in the umbral model .",
    "while in the quiet sun model it shows sensitivity to both photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields . since the magnetic fields at the photosphere is large , the magnetic field measured in quiet sun regions will mostly be photopsheric .",
    "if the @xmath1 were to show the sensitivity to magnetic field in the penumbral model similar to that of quiet sun model then one would expect larger field values in the penumbra which will be an average of photospheric and chromospheric fields while the umbral fields are exclusively chromospheric . to confirm this , more forward modeling",
    "is needed which includes the comparison of @xmath1 line formation at different regions with different field configurations .",
    "more over , response of @xmath1 line to various physical parameters needs to be studied and consistently explain the observations such as velocity and velocity gradients presented in this paper .    other possibility which can cause the observed weaker chromospheric fields in the umbral region",
    "is the faster divergence of stronger fields as suggested by @xcite .",
    "this scenario may consistently explain both the observed magnetic properties ( fig .",
    "[ fig:28fld ] ) as well as the velocity properties ( figs .",
    "[ fig : vgradhalpha_full]/[fig : vgradhalpha_part ] ) .",
    "because of the decrease in the field strength , the plasma becomes less inhibited by the magnetic fields and hence more free to move .",
    "that means if the stronger fields diverge faster compared to weaker fields then the the velocities should increase faster in the stronger field regions which are consistent with the observations .      from the close examination of stokes @xmath25 profiles of @xmath1 we found that the co i line has not intruded up to the extent that the amplitudes are affected .",
    "hence the results presented from @xmath1 based on amplitude asymmetry are reliable .    from the fig .",
    "[ fig : ampasym_fe ] it is clear that the amplitude asymmetry of fe i line tends toward zero with increase in photospheric magnetic field strength .",
    "this means , at the photospheric heights the gradients are smaller in umbra which corresponds to the region of strong fields .",
    "in contrast amplitude asymmetry observed in @xmath1 tend to increase with photospheric field strength as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : ampasym_hi ] .",
    "this implies that the field gradients are larger in the umbra at the chromosphere compared to penumbra .",
    "hence the analysis of amplitude asymmetry confirm the results obtained from the bisector analsysis in section [ sect : velgrad ] .",
    "in this paper we have used the multiwavelength spectropolarimetric tool to understand the stratification of the magnetic and velocity fields in the solar atmosphere . out of the two lines considered for spectropolarimetry , one forms at photospheric height ( fe i @xmath0 ) and the other spans almost from the upper photosphere to upper chromosphere ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "hence , these lines were useful in studying the connection between physical parameters at the photospheric and chromospheric heights .",
    "the main physical parameters studied in this paper are the magnetic and velocity fields in an active region .",
    "as discussed in section [ sect : losmag ] , the los magnetic field measured in chromosphere is in general weak compared to its photospheric counterpart .",
    "the weakening of the chromospheric field is much faster for the corresponding strong photospheric field .",
    "the magnetic field strengths observed in the umbral chromosphere are much weaker than those expected from the extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field . for instance",
    ", the field strength inferred through @xmath1 observations is about 400 g where as the field strength obtained through the extrapolation of the observed photosperic field under potential field approximation to an height of 2000 km is about 1000 g ( assuming that the height of formation of @xmath1 is about 2000 km ) .",
    "various possibilities have been discussed which can cause the weaker fields observed in the umbral chromosphere .",
    "the most probable ones are the fast divergence of the stronger fields when they propagate upward in the atmosphere @xcite and ambiguity in the height resolution of @xmath1 magnetic sensitivity which may be photospheric and/or chromospheric depending on the region of observation @xcite .",
    "if former is the reason , then it can explain the observed properties of both velocity and the magnetic fields presented in this paper .",
    "this is because , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , observed chromospheric fields are systematically weaker at the locations where strong photospheric fields are observed .",
    "if the weaker field strengths observed at the umbral chromosphere are truly of solar origin then this implies that the umbral fields decrease more rapidly with height compared to penumbral fields .",
    "rapid decrease in field strengths cause rapid increase in velocity with height as there is a small upflow in the umbral photosphere .",
    "observations also show that the velocity increases more rapidly in the umbral region compared to penumbral region ( section [ sect : velgrad ] ) .",
    "earlier observations by @xcite have also indicated the weakening of the magnetic field which is larger for stronger fields . in their observations",
    "quicker weakening of the stronger fields is not apparent , probably , because of the lines ( mg i b1 and b2 at @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) used to infer chromospheric magnetic field that originate at the lower chromosphere . while the observations based on @xmath1 presented in this paper as well as earlier by @xcite show clearly that the strong fields weaken quickly with height because in these works , to infer chromospheric magnetic field only the spectral region close to its line core is considered which samples mostly the higher layers of the chromosphere @xcite .",
    "hence there is a possibility that the weaker los field strengths observed in the umbral chromosphere are caused due to the faster divergence of the stronger fields .",
    "however , we would like to caution that the reliability of the cog method in estimating the los magnetic field strengths discussed in this paper ( section [ sect : losb ] ) is for simple solar atmospheric model .",
    "but , in reality the solar atmosphere may be complicated .",
    "more studies on the magnetic and velocity response functions for @xmath1 in different regions will help in better interpretation of the observations .",
    "simultaneous multiline spectropolarimetry , which includes @xmath1 and at least one more line which is formed at the chromosphere ( preferably infrared @xmath62 triplet line at @xmath638542 ) and a photospheric line , is needed to get further insight into the physical processes that take place in the chromosphere .",
