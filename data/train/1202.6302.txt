    "the study of non - zero degree maps between closed , oriented manifolds has become very active over the last few decades  @xcite .",
    "the existence of a non - zero degree map , @xmath1 , defines a transitive relation on the set of homotopy types of closed , oriented manifolds .",
    "whenever such a map exists we say that @xmath2 dominates @xmath3 and write @xmath4 . in this case",
    "@xmath2 is at least as complicated as @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the induced maps in rational homology are surjective , thus , in particular , the betti numbers of @xmath3 are bounded from above by those of @xmath2 .",
    "also , @xmath4 implies that the fundamental group of @xmath2 surjects onto a finite index subgroup of the fundamental group of @xmath3 .    in dimension two ,",
    "the domination relation coincides with the ordering given by the genus , but in higher dimensions it fails to be an ordering .",
    "we illustrate this by the following two examples in dimension three .",
    "the examples have obvious generalizations to higher dimensions .",
    "the two three - manifolds @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy @xmath7 and @xmath8 , but fail to be homotopy equivalent .",
    "let @xmath2 be a hyperbolic homology three - sphere , and @xmath9 .",
    "then @xmath3 has larger first betti number than @xmath2 , and so @xmath10",
    ". we also have @xmath11 since the fundamental group of @xmath3 is infinite cyclic , and so can not surject onto the fundamental group of a closed negatively curved manifold , for example by preissmann s theorem .",
    "thus @xmath2 and @xmath3 are not comparable under the domination relation .    in this paper ,",
    "we study domination by products for three - manifolds .",
    "this is motivated by the work of lh and the first author in  @xcite , where strong restrictions were found for certain manifolds with large universal coverings to be dominated by products .",
    "in fact , the results of those papers show that three - manifolds dominated by products can not have hyperbolic or @xmath12-geometry , and must often be prime .",
    "however , in this paper we will not use those earlier results , but follow a more direct approach .",
    "this is possible since in dimension three the only product manifolds are those with a circle factor , and this gives much stronger constraints than the consideration of arbitrary products .",
    "the main result we prove here is the following :    [ t : topargument ] a closed , oriented , connected three - manifold @xmath3 is dominated by a product @xmath13 if and only if    1 .",
    "either @xmath3 is finitely covered by a product @xmath14 , for some aspherical surface @xmath15 , or 2 .",
    "@xmath3 is finitely covered by a connected sum @xmath16 .    as usual ,",
    "the empty connected sum corresponding to @xmath17 is @xmath18 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : topargument ] falls naturally into two parts . on the one hand",
    ", we have to prove that all three - manifolds not listed in the statement of the theorem can not be dominated by products . on the other hand",
    ", we have to prove that the manifolds listed in the theorem are indeed dominated by products .",
    "this is obvious for manifolds finitely covered by products , but it is not obvious for the connected sums occurring in the second statement",
    ". here the proof proceeds by constructing certain maps of non - zero degrees as branched coverings .",
    "this construction , which also has a high - dimensional generalization , is of independent interest .",
    "previously , many non - trivial results have been proved about the domination relation in dimension three using a variety of tools different from the ones we use here , such as thurston s geometries , gromov s simplicial volume , and the seifert volume .",
    "a survey of the state of the art at the beginning of the last decade is given in  @xcite .",
    "for more recent results , especially related to the issue of finiteness of sets of mapping degrees between three - manifolds , see for example  @xcite and the papers quoted there .",
    "our proofs here are independent of this earlier work , and in fact clarify certain claims made there , cf .  subsection  [ ss : w ] below .",
    "it is not immediately obvious to what extent theorem  [ t : topargument ] really depends on the assumption that the domains of our dominant maps are products , and one could try to replace these products by fibered three - manifolds . for this purpose surface bundles over the circle are not interesting , since every three - manifold is dominated by such a bundle by a result of sakuma  @xcite .",
    "however , considering non - trivial circle bundles over surfaces we obtain a result parallel to theorem  [ t : topargument ] :    [ t : topbundle ] a closed , oriented , connected three - manifold @xmath3 is dominated by a non - trivial circle bundle over a surface if and only if    1 .",
    "either @xmath3 is finitely covered by a non - trivial circle bundle over some aspherical surface , or 2 .",
    "@xmath3 is finitely covered by a connected sum @xmath16 .    in section  [ s : ess ]",
    "we discuss the notion of rational essentialness in the case of three - manifolds . while this is not logically necessary for the proofs of our main results , we find it convenient , following  @xcite , to use this concept as an organizing principle . in section  [ s : proof1 ] , respectively section  [ s : proof2 ] , we then prove theorems  [ t : topargument ] and  [ t : topbundle ] for rationally essential , respectively inessential , three - manifolds . in section  [ s : algargum ] we reformulate these theorems in terms of thurston geometries and in purely algebraic terms .",
    "finally , in section  [ s : groups ] we determine the three - manifold groups presentable by products , and in section  [ s : dis ] we make some further remarks .",
    "these last two sections contain two new characterizations of ( aspherical ) seifert manifolds .",
    "the obstructions for domination by products found in  @xcite are applicable to rationally essential manifolds in the sense of the following definition going back to gromov  @xcite :    a closed , oriented , connected @xmath19-manifold @xmath3 is called rationally essential if @xmath20)\\neq 0\\in h_n(b\\pi_1(n);{\\mathbb{q } } ) \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath21 classifies the universal covering of @xmath3 .    for three - manifolds",
    ", this definition can be interpreted in terms of the kneser - milnor prime decomposition  @xcite .",
    "recall that this says that a closed oriented connected three - manifold @xmath3 has an essentially unique prime decomposition @xmath22 under the connected sum operation .",
    "each prime summand @xmath23 is either aspherical , is @xmath24 , or has finite fundamental group .",
    "we now have the following :    [ t : ess ] for a closed oriented connected three - manifold @xmath3 the following conditions are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 is rationally essential , 2 .",
    "@xmath3 has an aspherical summand @xmath23 in its prime decomposition , 3 .",
    "@xmath3 is not finitely covered by a connected sum @xmath16 , 4 .",
    "@xmath3 is compactly enlargeable , 5 .",
    "@xmath3 does not admit a metric of positive scalar curvature .",
    "the last two items are not relevant to the main results of this paper , so we will only discuss them briefly .    a connected sum is rationally essential if and only if at least one of the summands is . since @xmath24 and manifolds with finite fundamental group are not rationally essential , this proves the equivalence of ( @xmath25ess ) and ( asph ) .",
    "it is obvious that ( asph ) implies ( nfree ) . for the converse",
    "assume that @xmath3 contains no aspherical summands in its prime decomposition , i.e.  that @xmath3 has the form @xmath26 where the empty connected sum ( @xmath27 ) denotes the 3-sphere @xmath18 .",
    "the summands @xmath28 have infinite cyclic fundamental groups and the summands @xmath29 have finite fundamental groups @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the fundamental group of @xmath3 is the free product @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a free group on @xmath34 generators .",
    "we project this free product to the direct product of the @xmath35 to obtain the following exact sequence : @xmath36 by the kurosh subgroup theorem , @xmath37 is a free group @xmath38 .",
    "since it has finite index in @xmath39 , we see that @xmath3 has a finite covering whose fundamental group is free . by kneser s",
    "prime decomposition theorem and grushko s theorem , we deduce that this covering is a connected sum of @xmath19 copies of @xmath28 .",
    "this means that @xmath3 is finitely covered by a connected sum @xmath16 , where @xmath19 is the number of generators of the free group @xmath40 in the exact sequence ( [ eq.1 ] ) .    to see that ( asph ) implies ( enl ) it is enough to show that any aspherical three - manifold @xmath3 is compactly enlargeable",
    "this was proved by gromov and lawson  ( * ? ? ?",

    "we deal with the case where an aspherical summand does appear .",
    "the first part of theorem  [ t : topargument ] corresponds to the following statement :    [ p : ess ] a rationally essential closed oriented three - manifold @xmath3 is dominated by a product if and only if it is finitely covered by a product @xmath14 , with @xmath15 an aspherical surface .",
    "a manifold finitely covered by a product is of course dominated by that product .    for the converse assume that a product @xmath13 of a closed , oriented , connected surface @xmath42 with the circle dominates a closed , oriented , connected rationally essential three - manifold @xmath3 and let @xmath43 be a map of non - zero degree",

    "the rational essentialness of @xmath3 is equivalent to the existence of an aspherical summand @xmath23 .",
    "composing @xmath44 with the degree one map @xmath46 collapsing the connected summands other than @xmath23 , we obtain a dominant map @xmath47 between aspherical three - manifolds",

    "but then @xmath51 is a non - trivial central subgroup in @xmath39 , and so this group is freely indecomposable .",
    "thus we may assume that @xmath3 itself is prime and aspherical , for we can either appeal to perelman s proof of the poincar conjecture  @xcite to conclude @xmath52 , or we can argue that the assumption @xmath53 depends only on the homotopy type of @xmath3 , which does not change if we replace a manifold by its connected sum with a homotopy sphere .",
    "we have shown that @xmath3 is aspherical , and that its fundamental group has infinite center .",
    "if @xmath3 is haken , then it follows from a result of waldhausen  @xcite that @xmath3 is seifert fibered .",

    "( the fibration of @xmath3 is unique , cf .",
    "thus the composition @xmath57 kills the homotopy class of the @xmath50-factor in @xmath13 .",

    "this , together with the contrast between manifolds with the geometries @xmath129 and @xmath123 , shows that domination by products can not be detected by coarse methods , neither at the level of groups nor at the level of universal coverings of aspherical manifolds .",
    "one of the standard characterizations of closed seifert manifolds is through the property of being finitely covered by circle bundles . in the rationally essential case",
