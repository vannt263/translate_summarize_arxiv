    "all data are consistent , within a 20% error bar , with a time - independent dark energy distribution , as is the case with the cosmological constant @xmath2 and flat space ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these developments attracted attention to cosmological models in the presence of a @xmath2 term in einstein s gravitational equations .",
    "many excellent review papers are available @xcite on the implications of a cosmological constant in models of the universe .",
    "while the cosmological constant has little effect on the large - scale structure and dynamics of the universe , the microwave fluctuations will be significantly different in @xmath4 models @xcite .",
    "the scalar perturbations of @xmath4 models with multicomponent fluids ( i.e. , cold or hot dark matter , photons and massless neutrino ) have been computed by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in the linear approximation .",
    "these numerical results have been compared by @xcite and found to be in reasonable agreement .",
    "@xcite claim that for @xmath5 , one must use a numerical approach . in our work , however , we present an analytic treatment of the collisionless dust which represents the late - time evolution .    a complete solution describing the effect of the cosmological constant on perturbation dynamics is lacking in the literature , this including the rotational and gravitational wave perturbations . the temperature fluctuations of the cmbr have been computed in numerical schemes @xcite and @xcite investigate the integrated contributions .",
    "known as the sachs - wolfe effect , this is the variation in the redshift of a photon travelling freely in the universe rippled with perturbations .",
    "initial work , both on the zero - pressure model of the current state of the universe , and on the radiation - dominated era , was done by @xcite . the pressure - free universe in the presence of a cosmological constant has been considered by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they used the redshift parameter to investigate the behaviour of the density contrast . a more recent work by @xcite uses the formalism of @xcite to compute linear perturbations of a dust - filled friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) universe in the presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "they find that the presence of @xmath2 inhibits the growth of the fluctuations in time .",
    "[ a different approach to the perturbation problem of a different ( de sitter ) model , using the gauge - independent formulation , has been pursued by @xcite , for the investigation of stability under perturbations . ]",
    "neither of these earlier works reaches a complete perturbative picture .",
    "although the sachs - wolfe effect is computed by numerical methods , there is no analytic treatment so far available for @xmath5 .",
    "our aim here , therefore , is to consider , in an analytic framework , the sachs - wolfe effect and its contributions to the fluctuations of the cmbr in the presence of a cosmological constant .",

    "this is achieved by using the mirror symmetries of the elliptic integrals .    in sec .",
    "4 , we obtain the sachs - wolfe effect and its integral contribution which vanishes in the @xmath12 limit . an unexpected feature of the transfer function is that it changes sign and reverses the pattern of the temperature fluctuation on the celestial sphere at late times . in sec",
    "5 , we investigate the physical interpretation of our solution . taking the current experimental values of the cosmological parameters ,",
    "we obtain the comoving time elapsed between the emission at the surface of last scattering and reception of the photon .",
    "we find that the sachs - wolfe contribution to the cmb fluctuations in the presence of the cosmological constant is damped by a factor of @xmath13 today , because of the proximity , on the cosmological time scale , of the moment of reversal of the microwave temperature fluctuations and the reception .",
