    "the goal of this paper is to present a fully relativistic calculation of the two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) contributions to the inclusive @xmath0 response functions of nuclei for intermediate to high momentum transfers in a fermi gas model .",
    "consistency with perturbation theory is maintained and all diagrams with one - pion exchange in the nuclear current are considered , constructed by attaching a photon to all possible lines in the basic one - pion exchange feynman diagram . in this way not only meson - exchange currents ( mec ) arise ( for example , where the photon is attached to the pion ) , but also pionic correlation diagrams , where the virtual photon is absorbed by one of the two interacting nucleons .",
    "both kinds of diagrams are considered in our model , together with the usual virtual @xmath1-isobar electroexcitation and decay .",
    "we are motivated by previous work presented in  @xcite , where only the mec were included in the 2p-2h transverse ( @xmath2 ) response , together with earlier work both in non - relativistic  @xcite and relativistic  @xcite regimes .",
    "the contribution found from the 2p-2h excitations is small at the quasielastic ( qe ) peak , and increases with energy transfer , being more important in the dip region , where it is dominated by the @xmath1 current . at the non - relativistic level attempts",
    "were also made to evaluate the 2p-2h contribution of mec in the @xmath2-response for finite nuclei in a shell model  @xcite .",
    "the mec are not the only two - body operators able to induce 2p-2h excitations .",
    "the correlation operators arising from feynman diagrams where the photon is attached to a nucleon line , exchanging a pion with another nucleon , are of the same order as the mec in the perturbative expansion and should be included to be consistent  @xcite .",
    "these diagrams , however , present the problem of giving an infinite answer in a fermi gas model .",
    "the reason is that there is a nucleon propagator that can be on - shell in the region of the quasielastic peak .",
    "since the response function is the square of the amplitude , the resulting double pole gives an infinite result after integration . in dealing with this problem , in",
    "@xcite a prescription was followed by keeping the lines with a nucleon propagator strictly off the mass shell .",
    "a different approach was taken in  @xcite by subtracting from the proper self - energy its value on the mass shell , with the unphysical shortcoming of obtaining negative results for the 2p-2h responses to the left of the qe peak .",
    "finally , in @xcite a nucleon self - energy in the medium was introduced in the nucleon propagator . in dealing with the seven - dimensional integrals appearing in the 2p-2h responses , some of the previous calculations have resorted to the approximation of setting the two hole momenta both equal to zero in some of the diagrams  @xcite or by taking into account only an average nucleon momentum  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we revisit the double - pole problem to analyze the nature of the divergence of the resulting contributions . by isolating the divergent terms we are able to link them to the infinite extension of the fermi gas system .",
    "in fact the double - pole term can be related to the probability of one - nucleon emission followed by nucleon re - scattering off another nucleon , with the final ejection of two particles .",
    "this probability is infinite , since it is proportional to the propagation time of a real nucleon in a fermi gas .",
    "this fact was pointed out in @xcite where it was cured , as mentioned above , by introducing a nucleon self - energy with an imaginary part giving it a finite lifetime for collisions . in this paper",
    "we use a similar procedure by introducing a finite imaginary part @xmath3 in the nucleon propagator , but with a new meaning for the free parameter @xmath4 . instead of being an imaginary part of the nucleon self - energy for collisions , we relate it to the time @xmath2 that a nucleon can travel across the nucleus before leaving it . hence this term accounts for the finite size of a real nucleus in contrast to an infinite system like the fermi gas , where @xmath2 is infinite .",
    "the value of @xmath4 can be estimated to be roughly about 200 mev , appreciably larger than the usual values of the nucleon width for collisions .",
    "the structure of this work is as follows . in sect .  ii we present our model and define the 2p-2h response functions and the two - body current operators .",
    "we discuss in depth the divergence of the correlation diagrams and the need to introduce the parameter @xmath4 in sect .",

    "we take the initial nuclear state as the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) model ground state , @xmath18 , with all states with momenta below the fermi momentum @xmath19 occupied .",
    "the sum over final states can be decomposed as the sum of one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) plus two - particle two - hole ( 2p-2h ) excitations plus additional channels . in the impulse approximation",
    "the 1p-1h channel gives the well - known response functions of the rfg .",
    "here we focus on the 2p-2h channel where the final states are of the type @xmath20 , where @xmath21 are momenta of relativistic final nucleons above the fermi sea , @xmath22 , with four - momenta @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the four - momenta of the hole states with @xmath25",

    "the second source is related to the behavior of the principal values arising from the double and single poles near the rfg boundary of the quasielastic peak , where the principal values present a logarithmic divergence .    to illustrate the mathematical structure of this divergence we isolate as an example the singularities produced by the diagram of fig .",
    "the corresponding current operator can be written as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the on - shell energy .",
    "we have explicitly extracted the divergent part of the denominator , with a pole for @xmath84 in the limit @xmath85 .",

    "therefore one expects an additional divergence @xmath110 .",
    "the meaning of the term @xmath111 is explained in what follows .",
    "diagram 2(a ) , when the intermediate nucleon is on shell , gives the probability of a 1p-1h electroexcitation times the probability of quasielastic nucleon scattering .",
    "since the interaction probability is proportional to the interaction time @xmath2 , the probability of this re - scattering process is proportional to @xmath112 . therefore the cross section is proportional to @xmath2 . in an infinite system such as the fermi gas , the intermediate nucleon never leaves the nucleus and therefore @xmath113 .",
    "however , in a finite nucleus one expects no divergence because a high - energy nucleon will leave the nucleus in a finite time",
    ". therefore the interaction time is finite .",
    "the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath2 can also be obtained by inspection of the momentum - space propagator in quantum field theory  @xcite , computed as the vacuum expectation value of time - ordered fermion fields .",
    "the value @xmath4 in the denominator of the propagator can be seen as a regularization parameter in the fourier transform of the time step function for a particle with four - momentum @xmath114 @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 . for a real particle , @xmath118 ,",

    "we perform a study of the dependence of our results upon @xmath4 . unless otherwise specified we assume @xmath128 mev .    at this point",
    "we should mention that the use of eq .",
    "( [ square ] ) to compute the 2p-2h response functions becomes impractical due to complications in the numerical calculation of principal values in multidimensional integrals including the four diagrams of fig . 2 ( and the corresponding exchange parts ) .",
    "since we are forced to use a finite value of @xmath4 , it becomes more convenient to keep from the beginning the @xmath3 term in the denominator of the nucleon propagator in eq .",

    "we choose @xmath132 . at the end",
    "we have a 7-dimensional integration to be performed numerically .",
    "the usual procedure is to use a multi - dimensional montecarlo ( mc ) integration .",
    "since the pole structure of the integrand is numerically delicate , in this work we use instead a mixed montecarlo - simpson integration procedure .",

    "for other values of the momentum transfer the number of mc points is modified linearly with @xmath139 .",
    "we have performed a study of the stability of the results with the number of mc points and have found that the error from the integration procedure is within a few percent .    a pion - nucleon form factor is included in the 2-body currents : @xmath140 , with @xmath141 gev .",
    "we use the same value for the @xmath142 form factor in the delta current .",
    "the electromagnetic form factors are those of galster for the nucleon , and those used in  @xcite for the mec .",
    "to make contact with previous work , we apply our model to compute the 2p-2h longitudinal and transverse response functions for the nucleus @xmath143fe , and for momenta @xmath144 and @xmath145 mev / c .",
    "the results are presented in figs .  36 , where the separate contributions of the correlation and mec currents to the 2p-2h responses are also shown .",
    "the 1p-1h responses produced by the one - body ( ob ) current in the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg ) without interaction are also shown .",
    "a critical input for our model is the value of the parameter @xmath4 in the nucleon propagator , introduced to cure the divergence of the double pole . to see how the responses for the correlation contribution depend on @xmath4",
    "we show results for three different values : @xmath146 and 300 mev . for @xmath147 mev",
    ", the correlation 2p-2h contribution presents a shape with a maximum in the region of the quasielastic peak , but with a long tail extended to high transferred energies .",
    "the maximum is reminiscent of the pole structure of the nucleon propagator , and therefore a resonance appears for kinematics corresponding to the quasielastic condition in eq .",
    "( [ quasielastic ] ) . a shift to higher energies ( of the order of @xmath148 mev )",
    "is seen in the case of @xmath144 mev / c ( figs .  3 ,  5 ) . indeed for this value of @xmath139 the phase space for two - particle emission causes a suppression of the low - energy side of the response function .",
    "the resonant structure produced by the 2p-2h correlation contribution diminishes significantly with increasing values of the parameter @xmath4 .",
    "notice that for @xmath149 mev there is no maximum located at the qe peak .",
    "for an even lower value of the escape width , say @xmath150 mev , the magnitude of the resonant peak is of the same size as the ob response function .",
    "this correction coming from 2p-2h states is obviously too large to be compatible with experimental data that are already of the order of the 1p-1h response at the region of the qe peak .",
    "it should be mentioned that , although the 2p-2h contribution should be added to the 1p-1h one , the latter should be first corrected for final - state interaction ( fsi ) contributions not included in the bare rfg results shown in the figures . in fact",
    "fsi contribute importantly to one - nucleon emission through the coupling of 1p-1h to 2p-2h states in the final nucleus  @xcite .",
    "these processes involve , in particular , two - pion exchange , and are therefore of the same order as the 2p-2h response in the perturbative series , since it is the square of one - pion exchange matrix element .",
    "the inclusion of such contributions is out of the scope of the present study .",
    "the dependence of the correlation responses on the parameter @xmath4 is better appreciated in figs .  7 and 8 , where we show its contribution for the three chosen values of @xmath4 in the same plot .",
    "in the qe region the height of the responses approximately reduces to one half when @xmath4 doubles .",
    "this behavior follows because of the leading @xmath80 dependence in eq .",
    "( [ expansion ] ) , coming from the pole in the propagator . for high @xmath6",
    "the results are more similar and they are almost independent of @xmath4 in the high - energy tail . in this case , _",
    "i.e. _ large @xmath6 , there is no pole in the integrand and the contribution from the propagator is less sensitive to the precise value of @xmath4 .",
    "let us return now to figs .  36 , where the mec separate contribution is also shown .",
    "the transverse response ( figs .  3 ,  4 ) has a large peak with a maximum around @xmath151 , that comes from the @xmath1 propagator appearing in the @xmath1-current .",
    "it has the same resonant structure as the correlation current , but located in the region of the @xmath1 peak , where the real pion emission cross section has a maximum .",
    "we do not include the pion emission channel in our calculation .",
    "both channels should be summed up to obtain the total inclusive @xmath0 cross section .",
    "the @xmath1 peak is very small in the longitudinal response presented in figs .  5 and 6 .",
    "this is consistent with the predominant transverse character of the @xmath1 current , hence providing a small contribution to the longitudinal channel . for @xmath144",
    "mev the mec 2p-2h contribution is large ( small ) in the t ( l ) response .",
    "however , for @xmath152 mev ( figs .  4 ,  6 ) we find a larger effect in @xmath153 coming from the mec seagull and pionic at large energy transfer .",
    "indeed in a non - relativistic expansion in powers of @xmath154 the time component of the mec is of higher order than the transverse one . however , for @xmath152 mev , @xmath154 is larger than one , and the relative l component of the mec , compared to the t one , starts to increase .    in the case of the correlation",
    "current , we observe that its contribution , compared with the ob responses , is similar in the t and l channels .",
    "note that in the correlation current ( fig .",
    "2 ) the photon couples directly to a nucleon with the same interaction vertex @xmath155 as the ob current . the other side of the diagram with a pion coupled to a second nucleon is independent of the particular component of the current .",
    "the separate effects of the different currents contributing to the 2p-2h transverse responses are shown in figs .",
    "as shown , the seagull plus pionic ( spp ) currents alone give a small effect compared with the contributions from the @xmath1 and correlations .",
    "in fact , for @xmath128 mev the correlation response is much larger ( by a factor 2 or 3 ) than the spp response function ( middle panels in figs .  9 ,  10 )",
    ". we also observe that the separate seagull contribution is larger in magnitude than the pionic one , which is negligible for @xmath152 mev / c .",
    "note that the two currents interfere destructively and partially cancel when both are considered in the spp responses ( bottom panels ) .    in fig .",
    "11 we show the transverse response obtained by adding the total 2p-2h contributions to the ob response .",
    "a word of caution should be raised when analyzing these results .",
    "first , we have not added the correlation nor mec corrections to the 1p-1h response . moreover ,",
    "the two - pion - exchange interaction generates self - energy corrections to the ob current that lead to interference effects of the same order in the expansion as the corrections included here . as an example , fsi are known to redistribute the strength of the responses , producing a hardening , a reduction of the maximum and an increase of the high - energy tail  @xcite . recently also",
    "a large effect from both mec and fsi has been found in the 1p-1h channel for high momentum transfer  @xcite , which should be added to the present results .",
    "finally , the process of real pion emission ( not included here ) gives also a contribution in the transverse response located mainly the region of the delta peak .",
    "so far we have presented results for intermediate to high momentum transfer .",
    "results for lower values of @xmath156 and 410 mev / c are shown in figs .",
    "12 and 13 for the t and l response functions .",
    "this allows us to compare the present results with previous non - relativistic calculations  @xcite . in fig",
    "12 the structure function @xmath157 is presented , to allow a direct comparison with figs .",
    "11 and 12 of @xcite .",
    "the separate mec and correlation contributions to the 2p-2h t response shown in fig .",
    "12 are similar to the ones presented in @xcite .",
    "the mec produces a tail above the qe peak that increases with the energy transfer .",
    "the presence of correlations lead to an additional , significant raise of the tail .",
    "note that our correlation results are obtained for @xmath128 mev . in @xcite",
    "another prescription to deal with the nucleon pole was adopted . from our results",
    "we conclude that both prescriptions are compatible numerically .",
    "the ob response of @xcite included rpa correlations producing a reduction and hardening of the ob response .",
    "the 2p-2h longitudinal responses were not computed in @xcite , since the time components of the mec are of higher order in the non - relativistic reduction and hence , they were expected to be very small . however , our prediction for the correlation 2p-2h contribution in the l response , presented in fig .  13 , shows a similar effect as in the t response , _",
    "i.e. , _ a tail also appears for high energy transfer in the l response coming from correlations .",
    "contrary to the t channel , mec give no contribution in the l response .",
    "since the 2p-2h excitation is produced in this work by one - pion exchange , the results are strongly dependent on the details of this particular interaction .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "14 where we show how the results depend on the strong @xmath158 form factor for @xmath152 mev / c .",
    "the results without a form factor , _",
    "i.e. , _ with @xmath159 , are about three times as large as the results with the form factor .",
    "this is different from the findings at low momentum transfer  @xcite , where the pion form factor can be safely ignored .",
    "another issue is the dependence of the results on the @xmath1 form factors used in this work , both the electromagnetic and the strong ones , which are somewhat different from the parametrization used in the 2p-2h mec calculation of  @xcite .",
    "calculations done with both sets of parameters are compared in fig .  15 .",
    "our calculation gives a larger contribution for the t response than the one of  @xcite .",
    "hence the use of the same form factors reduces the discrepancy between the two calculations .",
    "some of the remaining differences could be linked to other details of the models , in particular to the different lagrangian chosen for @xmath1 electroexcitation .",
    "we should note that the two models are fully independent .",
    "while all the spin sums are performed analytically in  @xcite resulting in thousands of terms to be numerically integrated , in this work we first compute the spin matrix elements of the current and later we evaluate the squares and perform the sums numerically .    before concluding",
    ", we would like to stress that the 2p-2h responses in the present model are crucially dependent on details of the pion interaction .",
    "a critical ingredient of the model is the value of the parameter @xmath4 , identified with an escape width of a high - energy nucleon from the nucleus .",
    "we have proven that a value @xmath160 mev leads to results in agreement with the previous calculation of  @xcite .",
    "this parameter @xmath4 is different from the usual interaction width of particle states , usually associated with matrix elements of the phenomenological imaginary optical potential derived from elastic scattering data  @xcite .",
    "it has also been computed in nuclear matter in a semi - phenomenological approach  @xcite .",
    "the resulting width for 100 mev nucleons is of the order of 10 mev , which is too small to give reasonable results in our calculation .",
    "this is due to the @xmath80 behavior of the 2p-2h response divergence in the qe region , where the pole is being hit .    due to this divergent behaviour",
    ", for @xmath161 mev the results would be almost one order of magnitude larger than the ob responses at the maximum .",
    "we have checked that the the @xmath80 term in the forward diagrams is the main contribution to the 2p-2h correlations in the qe region for @xmath162 mev .",
    "the importance of correlations , for the same value of @xmath4 , increases with the nuclear mass .",
    "we have checked that for the case of @xmath123c where the sizes of the correlation responses , relative to the ob , are about 20% smaller than for @xmath143fe .",
    "this is what one would expect , since the number of correlated pairs increases with @xmath163 .",
    "moreover , since the estimated value of @xmath4 depends on the nuclear radius , eq .",
    "( [ epsilon ] ) indicates that one should use larger @xmath4-values for lighter nuclei , which in turn would reduce even more the size of the correlation responses .",
    "thus we expect an important @xmath164-dependence of correlations on the nuclear responses coming from the @xmath164-dependence of the escape width @xmath4 .",
    "a more deailed study of this issue will be presented in forthcoming work .",
    "in this work we have presented a fully relativistic model of inclusive two - particle emission reactions induced by electrons . starting with the free relativistic fermi gas we have considered all feynman diagrams in a perturbative expansion of the scattering amplitude with one photon and one pion exchange producing 2p-2h excitations .",
    "those diagrams can be classified in two sets , namely mec and correlation currents . in the latter",
    "there is a nucleon propagator that can be put on shell giving a double pole from @xmath165 when taking the square of the current matrix element .",
    "the corresponding 2p-2h response function diverges as @xmath80 when @xmath85 plus additional @xmath107 terms . giving a physical meaning to @xmath4 as the escape width of the nucleus , namely , twice the inverse of the nucleon propagation time",
    ", the fact that the corresponding response is infinite is related to the infinite extension of the fermi gas . using a finite value of @xmath4 we account for the finite size of the nucleus , hence getting a finite result . having no way to compute @xmath4 in a fermi gas ,",
    "we take it as a parameter . estimating in a crude way a value around @xmath166 mev , we have made an exploratory study of the results as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the correlation effects decrease with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "our analysis shows that the assumption @xmath167 mev is not unreasonable , whereas for smaller @xmath4-values the correlation contribution increases significantly in the qe region .    within this framework",
    "we have studied the properties and effects of the different 2p-2h contributions and other ingredients of the model on the transverse and longitudinal response functions of @xmath143fe for intermediate to high momentum transfer .",
    "the mec give rise to a wide peak in the region of the @xmath1 resonance that dominates the t response . in the l channel",
    "the mec are small for low momentum transfer , but they importantly increase for high momentum above the qe peak where their contribution is of the same size as the ob longitudinal response . concerning the correlations , they add to the mec in the high - energy tail and are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "the contribution of the correlations is similar in the l and t responses .",
    "the main goal of this paper has been to study the effect of 2p-2h pion correlations in the l and t response , analyzing the properties of these effects as a function of a single parameter @xmath4 . in future work",
    "we plan to investigate more physically founded ways to `` fine tune '' this parameter , including its dependence on kinematics and nuclear species .",
    "finite - size calculations in conjunction with the use of semi - phenomenological fits of the nucleon spreading width or fits to existing @xmath0 data will also be explored .",
