    "graphene , as a promising candidate of future nanoelectronic components , has recently attracted intensive research attention.@xcite graphene consists of a single atomic layer of graphite , which can also be viewed as a sheet of unrolled carbon nanotube .",
    "several anomalous phenomena ranging from half - integer quantum hall effect , non - zero berry s phase @xcite , to minimum conductivity @xcite , have been observed in experiments .",
    "these unusual transport properties may lead to novel applications in carbon - based nanoelectronics .",
    "in addition , the carriers in graphene behave as massless relativistic particles with an effective ` speed of light ' @xmath1 within the low - energy range ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "@xcite these massless dirac fermions in graphene manifest various quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) phenomena in the low energy range such as klein paradox phenomenon .",
    "@xcite ribbons with a finite width of graphene , referred to as graphene nanoribbons ( gnrs ) , have also been studied extensively .",
    "@xcite recent experiments by using the mechanical method @xcite and the epitaxial growth method @xcite show it is possible to make gnrs with various widths .",
    "the carbon atoms on the edge of gnrs have two typical topological shapes , namely armchair and zigzag .",
    "the analytical wavefunction and energy dispersion of zigzag nanoribbons have been derived by several research groups .",
    "@xcite for armchair gnrs , the analytical forms of wavefunctions within the low energy range have been worked out based on the effective - mass approximation .",
    "@xcite it is predicted that all zigzag gnrs are metallic with localized states on the edges , @xcite while armchair gnrs are either metallic or insulating , depending on their widths .",
    "@xcite to - date , there is no general expression of the wavefunction in armchair gnrs . in this paper",
    ", we derive a general analytical expression of wavefunction and eigen - energy in armchair gnrs applicable to various energy ranges .",
    "in part ii , we focus on perfect armchair gnrs without any edge deformation and derive the energy dispersion by imposing the hard - wall boundary condition . due to the quantum confinement , the spectrum breaks into a set of subbands and the wavevector along the confined direction becomes discretized .",
    "we observe that the electronic structure of perfect armchair gnrs strongly depends on the width of the ribbon .",
    "the system , for instance , is metallic when @xmath3 and is insulating otherwise , where @xmath4 is an integer .",
    "@xcite furthermore , we study the low energy electronic structure .",
    "the linear dispersion relation is observed in armchair gnrs . in part",
    "iii , we evaluate the effect of deformations on the edges on the electronic structure of armchair gnrs .",
    "calculation results based on the derived analytical wavefunction show that all armchair gnrs have nonzero energy gaps due to the variation of hopping integral near the edges .",
    "this observation is in line with the recently reported first - principle calculations .",
    "the structure of armchair gnrs consists two types of sublattices a and b as illustrated in fig .",
    "1 . the unit cell contains @xmath5 a - type atoms and @xmath5 b - type atoms .",
    "based on the translational invariance , we choose plane wave basis along the @xmath6 direction . within the tight - binding model , the wavefunctions of a and b sublattices can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the components for a and b sublattices in the @xmath10 direction , which is perpendicular to the edge . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the wave functions of the @xmath13 orbit of a carbon atom located at a and b sublattices , respectively . to solve @xmath14 and @xmath9 , we employ the hard - wall boundary condition @xmath15 choosing @xmath16 and substituting them into eq .",
    "( 2 ) , we get @xmath17 @xmath18 is the discretized wavevector in the @xmath10 direction and @xmath19 is the bond length between carbon atoms . to obtain the normalized coefficients , @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we introduce the normalization condition @xmath22 it is straightforward to obtain @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of unit cells along the @xmath6 direction .",
    "the total wavefunction of the system can be constructed by the linear combination of @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xmath27 under the tight binding approximation , the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the nearest neighbors .    in perfect armchair gnrs",
    ", we set @xmath30 and @xmath31 . by substituting eq .",
    "( 4 ) and eq .",
    "( 5 ) into the schrodinger equation , we can easily obtain the following matrix expression : @xmath32 where @xmath33 . solving eq . ( 6 ) , we get the energy dispersion and wavefunction as @xmath34 @xmath35 here , @xmath36 denotes the conduction and valance bands , respectively .",
    "@xmath37 is required within the first brillion zone .",
    "these results are valid for various energy ranges .    fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] shows the energy dispersion for perfect armchair gnrs with width @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here , we set @xmath40 .",
    "the results are the same as those obtained by using the numerical tight - binding method .",
    "the electronic structures of armchair gnrs depend strongly on their widths .",
    "when @xmath41 , the lowest conduction band and the upmost valence band touch at the dirac point , which leads to the metallic behavior of @xmath41 armchair gnrs .",
    "armchair gnrs , however , are insulating when @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "armchair gnrs with the width of @xmath3 ( @xmath4 is an integer ) are generally metallic and otherwise are insulating .",
    "@xcite in addition , we observe several interesting features in the band structures of armchair gnrs .",
    "+ ( i ) if @xmath5=7 , a flat conduction / valence band ( @xmath44 ) exists as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig_2 ] ( b ) .",
    "such a flat band generally corresponds to @xmath45 or equivalently @xmath46 .",
    "the energy dispersion becomes independent of @xmath47 and the eigen - energy always equals @xmath48 .",
    "flat band , in general , exists only when @xmath5 is odd .",
    "+ ( ii ) the subbands can be labeled by the quantum number @xmath49 .",
    "combined with the wave number @xmath47 along the @xmath6 direction , the quantum number @xmath49 can be used to define the chirality of the electrons in quasi-1d graphene ribbons similar to that in 2d graphene . to identify different subbands , we need the the quantum number @xmath50 of the @xmath51th conduction / valence band . here , the definition of the sequence of subbands is referred to as the value of eigen - energy , @xmath52 , in the center of first brillion zone ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath54    for the metallic armchair gnrs with width @xmath3 when @xmath55 or equivalently @xmath56 , the energy gap between conduction and valence bands is zero . therefore , @xmath57 corresponds to the first conduction / valence band in @xmath3 gnrs . for the second conduction / valence bands , @xmath52 should have the minimal nonzero value compared to the third or even higher band .",
    "after analyzing the value of @xmath52 , we find that @xmath58 , @xmath59 for metallic armchair gnrs ( @xmath3 ) . by similar analysis , for @xmath60",
    ", we can obtain @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 for @xmath64 armchair gnrs and @xmath61 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 for @xmath67 armchair gnrs , respectively .",
    "for all subbands , there is no general rule of the subband index @xmath49 . + ( iii ) lots of research interest have been focusing on the energy dispersion and wavefunction of 2d graphene and 1d gnrs within the low - energy range .",
    "@xcite low - energy electrons behaves as massless relativistic particles in a 2d infinite graphene system .",
    "@xcite whether electrons keep their relativistic property when they are confined in quasi-1d graphene nanoribbons is an interesting issue . in what follows",
    ", we will focus on the expansion of our analytical expressions to the low energy limit .",
    "when @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we rewrite the eigenenergy in eq .",
    "( 7 ) as + @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath49 is the subband index .",
    "this low energy expansion generates the @xmath72 linear dispersion , with fermi velocity @xmath73 .",
    "this expression reproduces the result of @xmath74 approximation .",
    "@xcite note that the wavevector in the confined direction ( @xmath75 ) is discretized , corresponding to different subbands .",
    "what is worthy mentioning is that this energy dispersion works well only at the low - energy limit . by substituting the value of @xmath76 into eq .",
    "( 9 ) , we get the low energy expansion of the first conduction / valence band for armchair gnrs as @xmath77    fig .",
    "3 shows the quality of low energy approximation . for large width armchair gnrs",
    ", low energy approximation seems work well except the edge of first brillion zone .",
    "as the width gets larger , the quantum confinement due to the edge becomes less important and the 1d nanoribbons tend to behave like 2d graphene . for large @xmath5 ,",
    "as expected , the band structure generates the linear dispersion relationship , @xmath78 , in the low - energy limit .    in addition , from the expression of wavefunction , we also obtain the local density of electronic states in perfect armchair gnrs , @xmath79 .",
    "4 shows the squared wave functions of the lowest conduction band at the center of first brillion zone .",
    "note that fig .",
    "4(a ) and ( c ) reproduce the results of the @xmath0 approximation .",
    "@xcite the state density oscillates as a function of the lattice position .",
    "the oscillation period is related to @xmath80 .",
    "for @xmath3 armchair gnrs , the oscillation period is just 3 , which is shown clearly in fig .",
    "4(a ) . for @xmath64 , @xmath81 armchair gnrs , we should write @xmath82 into an irreducible form @xmath83 .",
    "the oscillation period then equals @xmath84 , which is the numerator of the irreducible form of @xmath82 . to match the results presented in @xcite , we choose @xmath85 and @xmath86 as an example .",
    "we get @xmath87 and @xmath88 , respectively . as shown in fig .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) , the oscillation period of state density for @xmath85 and @xmath86 armchair gnrs equals their width .",
    "because every atom on the edge has one dangling bond unsaturated , the characteristics of the @xmath89 bonds at the edges can change gnrs electronic structure dramatically .",
    "@xcite to determine the band gaps of gnrs on the scale of nanometer , edge effects should be considered carefully .",
    "the change of edge bonds length and angle can lead to considerable variations of electronic structure , especially within the low energy range .",
    "@xcite in previously reported work , the edge carbon atoms of gnrs are all passivated by hydrogen atoms or other kinds of atoms / molecules .",
    "@xcite the bonds between hydrogen and carbon are different from those @xmath89 bonds .",
    "accordingly , the transfer integer of the @xmath90 bonds and on - site energy of carbon atoms at the edges are expected to differ from those in the middle of gnrs .",
    "the bond lengths between carbon atoms at the edges are predicted to vary about @xmath91 when hydrogenerated .",
    "@xcite correspondingly , the hopping integral increases about @xmath92 extracted from the analytical tight binding expression . @xcite to evaluate the effect of various kinds of edge deformation",
    ", we carried out general theoretical calculation and analysis with our analytical solution of armchair gnrs .",
    "in general , we can set the variation of the transfer integer and on - site energy as @xmath93 , @xmath94 for the @xmath51th a - type or b - type carbon atom in the unit cell .",
    "the hamiltonian of the gnrs with deformation on the edge can be rewritten as @xmath95 it is readily to obtain the energy dispersion and wavefunction by solving the schrodinger equation @xmath96 @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the energy shift originating from the variation of on - site energy , while the energy shift from the hopping integral variation is @xmath99 .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    such a general expression could include various kinds of edge deformations , ranging from the quantum confinement effect due to the finite width , to the effect of saturated atoms or molecules attached to edge carbon atoms .",
    "this result shows that the deformation leads to a considerable deviation of the energy dispersion relation and wavefunction of the deformed system from those in perfect armchair gnrs .",
    "the local state density on both kinds of sublattices , however , remains the same as that in perfect armchair gnrs .",
    "the reason is that the wavefunctions of sublattices a and b change their relative phases , but keep the magnitudes unchanged .",
    "the variations from both the on - site energy and hopping integral contribute to the energy shift , while , the change of on - site energy has no contribution to the wavefunction as shown in eq .",
    "( 8) . to verify our findings , we reproduce the energy gap observed in the recent work @xcite by considering only the variation of hopping integrals of the bonds on the edges ( @xmath100 , others equals zero ) .",
    "the corresponding energy gaps for different width ribbons are as follows : @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the energy gaps of perfect armchair gnrs .",
    "their values can be extracted from eq.(8 ) : @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "this result suggests all armchair graphene ribbons with edge deformation have nonzero energy gaps and are insulating correspondingly .",
    "in this paper , we study the electronic states of armchair gnrs analytically . by imposing the hard - wall boundary condition , we find the analytical solution of wavefunction and energy dispersion in armchair gnrs based on the tight - binding approximation .",
    "our results reproduce the numerical tight - binding calculation results and the solutions using the effective - mass approximation .",
    "we also derive the low - energy approximation of the energy dispersion , which matches the exact solution except for the edge of first brillion zone .",
    "the linear energy dispersion is observed in armchair gnrs in the low energy limit .",
    "in addition , we also evaluate the impact of the edge deformation on gnrs and derive a general expression of wavefunction and energy dispersion .",
    "we can reproduce the energy gap for hydrogenerated armchair gnrs presented in @xcite .",
    "when we consider the edge deformation , all armchair gnrs have nonzero energy gaps and thus are insulting .",
    "overall , the derived analytical form of the wavefunction can be used to quantitatively investigate and predict various properties in armchair graphene ribbons .",
