    "cold - atom experiments provide a clean and versatile platform for simulating interacting quantum many - body systems and investigating new quantum phases  @xcite . in a system of cold atomic mixtures",
    "@xcite , spin - dependent external potentials can be introduced by the different masses or the hyperfine states of the constituent  @xcite . spatial phase separation ( i.e. , demixing ) of the components happens at repulsive interactions , which on the one hand will diminish the cooling efficiency in a sympathetic cooling procedure  @xcite . on the other hand , at stronger repulsive interactions and/or tighter confinement",
    ", this procedure provides a way to demix the different atomic species  @xcite .",
    "different types of mixtures in optical lattices  @xcite have been studied , including boson mixtures  @xcite , fermion mixtures of same or different species  @xcite , which can be well modelled by a lattice model interacting through a hubbard - type term with confining potentials . by detuning asymmetrically the laser frequencies with respect to the two hyperfine states  @xcite , or by trapping the two different atoms of unequal masses",
    ", one realizes the different types of spin - dependent external potentials  @xcite .    for a better understanding of the interplay of the spin - dependent external potentials and the repulsive interaction on the process of demixing , it is essential to have a complete state diagram , from which one can easily find the optimal parameters to realize the demixing or to control the cooling efficiency . in this paper",
    ", we study the demixing of two fermion species ( taking as pseudospins ) of same masses in optical lattices with spin - dependent external potentials .",
    "this brief report is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the modified hubbard model under a spin - dependent external potential is introduced .",
    "section iii contains the main numerical results .",
    "finally , we summarize the paper .",
    "a two - component fermi gas in optical lattices with a spin - dependent external potential can be described by a modified one - dimension ( 1d ) fermi - hubbard model as @xmath2 ^ 2{\\hat n}_{i\\sigma}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the hopping parameter between nearest neighbors and @xmath4 the on - site repulsive interaction .",
    "the strength of the spin - dependent external potential is @xmath5 .",
    "the two components fermions are represented by pseudospin @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath7 is the length of the lattice , which is chosen to be long enough to keep the atomic densities at edges to be zero .",
    "@xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator on site @xmath10 with spin @xmath11 .",
    "the density operator for spin @xmath11 is @xmath12 .    by taking @xmath3 as the unit of energy , we rewrite the hamiltonian as @xmath13 ^ 2(\\gamma{\\hat n}_{i\\uparrow}+{\\hat n}_{i\\downarrow})\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with rescaled @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "@xmath16 is the ratio between the spin - up and spin - down external potentials . for convenience , we assume that @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath18 .",
    "the number of fermions of each species is @xmath19 with @xmath20 the spin - resolved density and the total number of fermions @xmath21 . the polarization @xmath22 .",
    "the local magnetization is defined as @xmath23 . when @xmath24 , the model recovers the mostly studied hubbard model in the presence of a harmonic trap  @xcite .",
    "we are interested in the effects induced by the spin - dependent external potentials . for atomic mixture of different species in optical lattices formed by lasers of wavelength @xmath25",
    "the ratio of the trapping potential @xmath0 can reach @xmath26 for fermionic mixtures of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "larger @xmath0 is hard to achieve at the present experiment but conceivable .",
    "we study in the following the effects of @xmath32 and @xmath0 on the phase separation .",
    "our simulation is done by using the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg )  @xcite . in principle",
    "the number of states kept are 300 per block and 30 sweeps are used ( when checking the numerical accuracy , up to 1000 states per block and 50 sweeps are used ) , with a truncation error in the final dmrg step usually smaller than @xmath33 . without mentioning in the text , we will choose the spin - unpolarized system with fixed particle number @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we illustrate the physics induced by @xmath0 in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] . in panel",
    "( a ) , due to the same external potential , the spin - up and spin - down atoms have the same densities and accumulate at the potential minimum . with the increase of @xmath0 ,",
    "the spin - up atoms suffer from stronger trapping potential , and part of the spin - down atoms are forced out of the system center , as the result of the competition between the potential energy and the interaction energy , which is shown in panel ( b ) .",
    "panel ( b ) including ( a ) is the case where the spin - up and spin - down atom mixture coexists in the center of the trap and forms a phase - mixed ( pm ) region . in panel ( c ) , spin - up and spin - down atoms are becoming phase - separated at a critical @xmath36 , decided when the local occupation for spin - down atoms disappears at the center ( numerically , we get the critical value of @xmath37 when @xmath38 with @xmath10 ranging over the two central points  @xcite . ) . beyond the critical @xmath37 ,",
    "the spin - up and spin - down atomic clouds have diminished spatial overlap and are phase - separated  @xcite .",
    "a completely phase - separated case is shown at @xmath39 in panel ( d ) .",
    "panel ( c ) including ( d ) defines a phase - separated ( ps ) region . for comparison , in fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , we present also the results based on the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) by using a recent parametrized energy functional for the 1d hubbard model  @xcite . in the lsda , the energy density of the inhomogeneous system is approximated at each spatial position by the one corresponding to a uniform gas at the local value of the density .",
    "we find that the lsda gives qualitatively the same results as those of dmrg .",
    "however , the performance of the lsda scheme at weaker interactions deteriorates with decreasing particle number where the hopping kinetic energy processes . as a result , the regions close to the edges of the trap and the phase - separation areas are also those where the lsda is less accurate .    to have a complete understanding on the effect of @xmath0 on the phase separation , in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma ] , the contour plot is shown for the spin - up density @xmath40 ( up panel ) and spin - down density @xmath41 ( down panel ) with @xmath42 . when @xmath43 , an insulating core of fully polarized ( spin - up ) atoms ( @xmath44 ) is formed due to the strong confinement , which is incompressible and originates from the pauli exclusion principle . as a result , the magnetization tends to 0.5 .",
    "around @xmath45 , stable density distributions are formed and no more changes can be observed by further increasing @xmath0 .",
    "the effects of the repulsive interaction @xmath32 ( with fixed @xmath46 ) on the phase separation are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : u ] . for a non - interacting system ( @xmath47 )",
    ", the two components keep mixed .",
    "the spin - down atoms are forced out of the center due to the strong repulsive interaction between the components when increasing @xmath32 .",
    "the system reaches the critical ps point at @xmath48 .",
    "the two fermion components are fully separated around @xmath49 at which the density distributions become stable .",
    "the interplay of @xmath0 and @xmath32 segregates the two components .",
    "the spin - up atomic cloud that suffers from a stronger external potential tends to accumulate at the center . as a result",
    ", the spin - down atoms are repelled from the center due to a larger repulsion , which decreases the interaction energy but increases the external potential energy .",
    "the equilibrium density distribution is the result of the balance between these two opposite effects .",
    "the shape of the density profiles becomes stable at further increasing @xmath0 and @xmath32 .",
    "to understand this point , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] the energies as functions of @xmath0 and @xmath32 , respectively . in the left panel",
    ", we study the ground - state energy @xmath50 and the energy except the last term @xmath51 as a function of the ratio @xmath0 . here",
    "@xmath52 is the kinetic energy , @xmath53 the double occupancy @xmath54 , and the respective external potential energy is @xmath55 ^ 2\\langle { \\hat n}_{i\\sigma } \\rangle$ ] .",
    "we notice that at @xmath56 , @xmath57 becomes a linear function of @xmath0 : @xmath58 and @xmath59 goes to a constant @xmath60 , which indicates that the densities are becoming stable and the only contribution to the energy comes from the last term linear to @xmath0 . in the right panel",
    ", we study the ground - state energy @xmath57 and the interaction energy @xmath61 as a function of the interaction strength @xmath32 .",
    "we can see that at @xmath62 , @xmath57 and @xmath63 become constant , which indicates that the two components are demixed almost completely except the tails of the clouds . under the stable density distributions , the on - site interaction contributes a constant energy .    to have a overview on the transformation of the system from pm to ps region under the interplay of the ratio of the external potential and the repulsive interaction , we show the @xmath1 state diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] for different parameter systems . for the unpolarized systems , three different @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are shown . a polarized system of @xmath66 and @xmath67 is also included . as mentioned in the ref .",
    "@xcite , there exists a critical repulsive interaction strength ( @xmath68 ) above which the demixing evolves .",
    "all the critical points form the phase boundary which distinguishes the pm phase from the ps one . for the unpolarized system , the different @xmath69 give very similar phase boundaries . for the systems of the same ratio @xmath0 , the demixing of the polarized system is easier due to more spin - up atoms and less spin - down atoms in the trap . thus , smaller @xmath68",
    "is observed for the onset of the phase separation .    by carefully investigating the different phase boundaries",
    ", we find that there is a minimum point in each of the phase boundaries , labeled by @xmath70 , which is closely related to whether the insulating core of spin - up atoms is formed in the trap center . to understand this minimum point , we show in fig .",
    "[ critical ] the 3d plot of spin - up and spin - down densities for the system of @xmath34 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath0 is fixed to be 3 and 5 in the upper and bottom panels , corresponding to the left and right part of the minimum point [ i.e. , the third point : 3 @xmath73 in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase ] ] in the phase boundary , respectively .",
    "we check the spin - up and spin - down densities by varying the interaction strength .",
    "we find that the local spin - up densities for @xmath46 are always smaller than one ( @xmath74 ) during the demixing process , i.e. , there is no insulating plateau . while the spin - up",
    "densities for @xmath75 form an insulating core ( @xmath44 ) during the demixing process . from the above analysis",
    "we know that , the larger the @xmath0 , i.e. , the tighter the confinement , the easier is to deplete the spin - down atoms . as a result ,",
    "smaller @xmath68 is needed to achieve ps .",
    "this is the reason why the phase boundary firstly goes down when increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , when the insulating plateau appears , the depletion of the spin - down atoms becomes more difficult and stronger on - site interaction is needed to achieve ps . that is ,",
    "larger @xmath68 is needed , which makes the phase boundary go up slightly .",
    "in this paper , we discuss the demixing of fermion mixtures in optical lattices under the presence of a spin - dependent external potential by means of the dmrg and lsda methods .",
    "the effects of the ratio of the spin - up and spin - down dependent external potential @xmath0 and the repulsive interaction @xmath32 on the phases of the system are analyzed in details .",
    "the competition between the spin - dependent potential energy and the repulsive interaction energy is responsible for the phase separation .",
    "the external potential tends to push the atoms to the center of the system , while @xmath32 tends to delocalize atoms .",
    "the @xmath1 state diagram is obtained in which the phase boundary distinguishes the pm from the ps phases . a minimum point in each of the phase boundaries is observed . in the left part of this point , the local spin - up densities @xmath76 are always smaller than one which makes the depletion of the spin - up comparatively easier . while in the right part of this point , the spin - up densities form an insulating core ( @xmath44 ) during the demixing process .",
    "the insulating plateau makes the depletion of the spin - down atoms more difficult and as a result , the phase boundary in this case goes up slightly .",
    "the detailed state diagram found in this paper is helpful in choosing the optimal parameters to achieve demixing of the constituents and on the other hand useful in controlling the efficiency of a sympathetic cooling for the mixtures .",
