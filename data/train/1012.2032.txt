    "the data set of charged current quasi elastic ( ccqe ) events recently released by the miniboone collaboration @xcite provides an unprecedented opportunity to carry out a systematic study of the double differential cross section of the process , _ + ^12 - 5mu c ^- + x  , averaged over the neutrino flux .    the charged current elastic neutrino - nucleon process is described in terms of three form factors .",
    "the proton @xmath0 and neutron @xmath1 vector form factors , @xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 being the four - momentum transfer ) , have been precisely measured up to large values of @xmath6 in electron - proton and electron - deuteron scattering experiments , respectively ( for a recent review , see , e.g. , ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath6-dependence of the nucleon axial form factor @xmath7 , whose value at @xmath8 can be extracted from neutron @xmath9-decay measurements , is generally assumed to be of dipole form and parametrized in terms of the so called axial mass @xmath10 : f_a(q^2 ) = g_a  ( 1 + q^2/m_a^2 ) ^-2  .",
    "the world average of the measured values of the axial mass , mainly obtained from low statistics experiments carried out using deuterium targets , turns out to be @xmath11  gev @xcite , while the analyses performed by the k2k @xcite and miniboone @xcite collaborations using oxygen and carbon targets , respectively , yield @xmath12 .",
    "it would be tempting to interpret the large value of @xmath10 reported by miniboonne and k2k as an _ effective _ axial mass , modified by nuclear effects not included in the oversimplified fermi gas model employed in data analysis .",
    "however , most existing models of nuclear effects ( for recent reviews see ref.@xcite ) fail to support this explanation , suggested by the authors of ref.@xcite , a prominent exception being the model of ref.@xcite .",
    "obviously , a fully quantitative description of the electron - scattering cross section , driven by the known vector form factors , is a prerequisite for the understanding of the axial vector contribution to the ccqe neutrino - nucleus cross section .    over the past two decades",
    ", the availability of a large body of experimental data has triggered the development of advanced theoretical descriptions of the nuclear electromagnetic response .",
    "the underlying scheme , based on nuclear many - body theory and realistic nuclear hamiltonians , relies on the premises that i ) the lepton kinematics is fully determined and ii ) the elementary interaction vertex can be extracted from measured proton and deuteron cross sections .",
    "the above _ paradigm _ has been successfully applied to explain the electron - nucleus cross section in a variety of kinematical regimes ( for a recent review of the quasi - elastic sector see ref.@xcite ) . however , in view of the uncertainties associated with the energy of the incoming beam , the identification of the reaction mechanisms and the determination of the interaction vertex , its extension to the case of neutrino scattering may not be straightforward .",
    "the comparison between theoretical calculations and data , presented in section [ enua ] , suggests that the measured electron- and neutrino - nucleus cross sections can not be explained within the same scheme .",
    "the difficulties associated with the description of the flux unfolded total cross section are discussed in section [ paradigm ] .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusions ] i argue that the the _ paradigm _ succesfully employed to analyze electron - nucleus scattering is not suitable for application to processes in which the lepton kinematics is not fully determined , and must be significantly modified .",
    "electron - nucleus scattering cross sections are usually analyzed at fixed beam energy , @xmath13 , and electron scattering angle , @xmath14 , as a function of the electron energy loss @xmath15 .",

    "the three - momentum transfer @xmath19 turns out to be nearly constant , its variation over the range shown in the figure being @xmath20 5% . as a consequence",
    ", the cross section of fig.[xsec_ee ] can be readily related to the linear response of the target nucleus to a probe delivering momentum @xmath21 and energy @xmath15 , defined as [ sqw ] s(*q * , ) = _ n | n | _ * k * a^_*k*+*q * a_*k * | 0 |^2 ( + e_0 - e_n )  . in the above equation ,",

    "the magnitude of the momentum transfer , @xmath28  450  mev , is large enough to make the impulse approximation ( ia ) scheme , in which the nuclear response of eq.([sqw ] ) reduces to @xcite s_ia(*q * , ) = d^3k  de p_h(*k*,e ) p_p(*k*+*q*,-e )  , [ s : ia]safely applicable @xcite . in eq.([s : ia ] ) , the hole and particle spectral functions , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , describe the energy and momentum distributions of the struck nucleon in the initial ( hole ) and final ( particle ) states , respectively .    the solid line of fig .",

    "the above conclusion , while being based on a calculation carried out within the scheme of refs.@xcite , is largely model independent .",
    "theoretical approaches providing a quantitative description of the electron - nucleus cross section in the qe channel , are bound to predict ccqe neutrino - nucleus cross sections significantly below the miniboone data if the value of the axial mass is set to 1.03 gev . as a matter of fact ,",
    "within the approach of refs.@xcite , the axial mass yelding the best @xmath39-fit to the flux integrated miniboone @xmath6-distribution , @xmath401.6 gev , turns out to be even larger than that reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite have shown that this value of @xmath10 also explains the muon energy spectrum and angular distribution obtained from integration of the double differential cross seciton of ref.@xcite .",

    "figure [ sigmatot ] shows a comparison between the the miniboone _ flux unfolded _ total cross section and the results of the calculations of of ref.@xcite . it is apparent that in this case using @xmath45 gev leads to overestimating the data in the region of high energy ( @xmath46 mev ) , where the choice @xmath47 gev , resulting from he analysis of ref.@xcite , provides a better fit .",

    "@xcite , the main mechanism responsible for the enhancement that brings the theoretical cross section into agreement with the data is multi - nucleon knock out , leading to @xmath48 particle-@xmath48 hole ( @xmath48p-@xmath48h ) nuclear final states ( @xmath49 ) . within the approach of refs.@xcite , the occurrence of 2p-2h final states",
    "is described by the continuum part of the spectral function , arising from nucleon - nucleon correlations @xcite .",
    "it gives rise to the tail extending to large @xmath15 , clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ xsec_ee ] . however , its contribution turns out to be quite small ( less than 10% of the integrated spectrum ) .",
    "the analysis of the momentum distribution sum rule indicates that the contributions of @xmath48p-@xmath48h final states with @xmath50 are negligibly small @xcite .",
    "according to the philosophy outlined in this paper , in order to firmly establish the role of multi - nucleon knock out in ccqe neutrino interactions the model of ref .",
    "@xcite should be thoroughly tested against electron scattering data .",
    "the theoretical and experimental results discussed in this paper suggest that the main difference involved in the analysis of neutrino - nucleus scattering , as compared to electron - nucleus scattering , lies in the flux average .    unlike the electron cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ xsec_ee ] , the flux averaged ccqe neutrino cross section at fixed energy and scattering angle of the outgoing lepton picks up contributions from different kinematical regions , where different reaction mechanisms dominate .",
    "consider , as an example , the cross section at @xmath51 , the central value of the bin considered in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ dsigma ] , and @xmath52 mev , corresponding to the maximum of the measured cross section .",
    "figure [ columbia ] displays the behavior of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath53 in these kinematical conditions and the miniboone flux as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath44 .     in the kinematical conditions corresponding to maximum of the cross section displayed in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ dsigma ] , plotted as a function of the neutrino energy @xmath44 . for comparison ,",
    "the miniboone neutrino flux is also shown . ]",
    "it turns out that @xmath54 , corresponding to quasi - elastic kinematics , and @xmath55 , corresponding to the dip region , are associated with neutrino energies @xmath56  mev ( the mean energy of the miniboone flux ) and @xmath57  mev , respectively , and that 0.83   it follows that the flux averaged cross section picks up the contributions of quasi - elastic scattering and mec with about the same probability .",
    "hence , it can not be described according to the paradigm successfully applied to electron scattering , based on the tenet that the lepton kinematics is fully determined .    a _ new paradigm _ , suitable for studies of neutrino interactions ,",
    "should be based on a more flexible model of nuclear effects , yielding a realistic description of the broad kinematical range associated with the relevant neutrino energies .",
    "nuclear many - body theory provides a consistent framework for the development of such a model . besides single- and multi - nucleon",
    "knock out , it should include the contributions of processes involving mec , which are long known to provide a significant enhancement of the electromagnetic nuclear response in the transverse channel @xcite .",
    "it has to be emphasized that quasielastic scattering and processes involving mec lead to the same final state , and can not be distinguished in the miniboone analysis .",
    "the occurrence of inelastic processes , leading to excitation of nucleon resonances and pion production should also be taken into account .    as a final remark",
    ", it has to be emphasized that a great deal of information could be obtained applying the new paradigm to the analysis of _ inclusive _ neutrino - nucleus cross sections , preferably , although not necessarily , through direct implementation of the resulting nuclear model in the monte carlo simulation codes .",
    "this kind of analysis , which has been succesfully carried out for electron - nucleus scattering , may help to reconcile the different values of the axial mass obtained by different experiments , and would be largely unaffected by the problems associated with the possible misidentification of ccqe events , recently discussed in ref .",
