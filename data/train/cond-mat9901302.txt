    "the properties of a variety of recently discovered quasi one - dimensional materials can be described by the alternating heisenberg chain ( ahc ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads : @xmath2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes the sites of a chain with length @xmath4 and @xmath5 are @xmath6 spin operators .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 is the next - nearest neighbor coupling , leading to frustration , and @xmath0 is the dimerization .",
    "we assume @xmath8 .",
    "the ahc is realized in nature in many materials that have two important but structurally inequivalent superexchange paths that are spatially linked , so that an alternating spin - spin interaction results .",
    "representative examples of materials of this type are @xmath9 @xcite and various aromatic free - radical compounds @xcite .",
    "alternating chains may also arise as a result of spontaneous dimerization , due to dynamical spin - phonon coupling .",
    "examples include the recently discovered inorganic spin - peierls compounds @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the ahc model ( [ ham ] ) is a straightforward generalization of the uniform heisenberg chain , which is the most widely studied quantum spin system .",
    "the uniform @xmath6 chain has a gapless excitation spectrum with a known dispersion relation and a rather complicated ground state which is characterized by strong quantum fluctuations , making it highly unstable to perturbations .",
    "the ahc generalizes the uniform chain by alternating the spin - spin interaction between two values , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and including next - nearest neighbor coupling ( frustration ) @xmath14 .",
    "since the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is rotationally invariant with respect to spin , the total spin is a good quantum number , and the ground state is a spin singlet .",
    "the translational symmetry however is broken by the dimerization , and the resulting system has a gap to the first excited state with @xmath15 .",
    "the model has a rather complicated spectrum of states at higher energies , including multimagnon continua and bound states .",
    "recent neutron scattering studies of @xmath9 carried out by garrett _",
    "@xcite show that this material can be described well by the alternating spin chain model .",
    "in addition , these measurements provide evidence for the existence of a two - magnon triplet ( @xmath15 ) bound state .",
    "similar studies of the spin - peierls material @xmath10 by ain _",
    "et al._@xcite , in combination with raman spectroscopy @xcite , suggest that a singlet @xmath16 bound state is present in this material .",
    "these experiments have strongly motivated the theoretical studies of the low - energy excitations of the ahc model , since the existence of magnetic bound states is one of its characteristic features .",
    "more generally , bound states seem to appear in all low - dimensional dimerized quantum antiferromagnets which have a gapped triplet spectrum above a singlet ground state @xcite .    besides the relevance to real compounds , the model ( [ ham ] ) is interesting from theoretical point of view since it contains two independent mechanisms for spin gap formation .",
    "subject of a special interest is the nature of excitations . at @xmath17",
    "the model exhibits two phases , separated by a critical value of frustration @xmath18 , known from numerous studies @xcite . for @xmath19",
    "the ground state is similar to that of the uniform heisenberg chain and frustration is irrelevant in this parameter regime .",
    "the elementary excitations are massless unconfined spinons with spin s=1/2 @xcite . at @xmath20",
    "there is a transition into a phase with spontaneously dimerized two - fold degenerate ground state .",
    "the spectrum acquires a gap and the elementary excitations are massive spinons @xcite . on the other hand haldane @xcite has shown that for any @xmath21 the spinons become confined into triplet @xmath15 excitations with a gap in the spectrum .",
    "interactions between the triplets can lead to additional massive singlet , @xmath16 , and triplet , @xmath15 , excitations below the continuum @xcite and even a sequence of further massive excitations @xcite . as @xmath22 the size of the elementary triplet ( or , equivalently",
    ", the spinon radius of confinement ) , @xmath23 , is known to scale as @xcite : @xmath24 for @xmath19 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 .",
    "therefore the triplets become nonlocal objects for small dimerization , ultimately giving way to completely unconfined spinons in the strict limit @xmath17 .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the ahc has been extensively studied by a variety of numerical methods .",
    "most recent work includes : exact diagonalizations ( ed ) carried out by bouzerar , kampf , and japaridze @xcite and barnes , riera and tennant @xcite , dimer series expansions by singh and weihong @xcite , and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) studies by sorensen _",
    "however there are only few analytical works studying the ahc model .",
    "uhrig and schulz@xcite have used the continuum limit field theory approach and predicted the possibility of singlet ( s=0 ) and triplet ( s=1 ) two - magnon bound states below the two - particle continuum in the dimerized phase ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "affleck @xcite and uhrig _",
    "et al._@xcite developed a description , based on the soliton picture in which the elementary excitations are treated as confined @xmath6 solitons ( spinons ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that @xmath28 soliton anti - soliton bound states are formed and their number increases as @xmath22 .",
    "bouzerar and sil @xcite have studied the excitation spectrum of the dimerized phase using the bond operator technique ( bot ) introduced by chubukov@xcite and sachdev and bhatt@xcite , in combination with the brueckner approach developed by kotov , sushkov , weihong , and oitmaa @xcite . the results of ref.@xcite are mainly inconsistent with the ed data .",
    "they are also inconsistent with our results in spite of the fact that we use the same approach .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy , as will become clear from our presentation below , is that the treatment of ref.@xcite is quite incomplete and misses several important technical aspects of the problem .",
    "the aim of the present work is to investigate theoretically the excited states of the dimerized phase ( @xmath27 ) of the ahc by using the analytic brueckner approach .",
    "previous applications of the brueckner approach include the two - layer heisenberg model @xcite , the quantum spin - ladder @xcite as well as the spin ladder with frustration @xcite . in all cases",
    "excellent agreement was achieved between the theoretical and numerical spectra .",
    "the brueckner approach is based on the description of the excitations as triplets above a strong coupling singlet ground state .",
    "in essence it represents an effective way of taking into account the hard - core constraint , which has to be imposed on the triplets , by treating the excitations as a dilute bose gas with infinite on - site repulsion .",
    "the method is valid while the on - site density of excitations ( triplets ) @xmath29 is small and under the assumption that the elementary triplets are well localized objects . in spite of the fact that the on - site density in the ahc is small even close to the point @xmath17 ( @xmath30 for @xmath31 )",
    ", we find that our approach fails at @xmath32 because the triplets become nonlocal objects .",
    "in the region @xmath33 the present method provides an excellent quantitative description of the excitation spectrum .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "we find the system of self - consistent equations describing the ahc with frustration and calculate the one - particle ( elementary triplet ) spectrum for a wide range of parameters .",
    "sec.iii describes the additional singlet and triplet modes which appear below the two - magnon continuum .",
    "these excitations are bound states of two elementary triplets . in sec.iv",
    "we calculate the contributions of the elementary and the additional triplet into the neutron scattering structure factor .",
    "sec.v contains our conclusions .",
    "in order to analyze the excitation spectrum of ( [ ham ] ) it is convenient to adopt the strong - coupling viewpoint . in the limit",
    "@xmath34 the ground state consists of non - overlapping spin singlets @xmath35 , where latexmath:[$|i,0>=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } [    here , and in all formulas below which involve triplet operators , the `` generalized '' site index @xmath3 represents the bonds with spin exchange @xmath12 .",
    "each singlet can be excited into a triplet state and therefore it is natural to introduce a creation operator @xmath37 for this excitation : @xmath38 , @xmath39 .",
    "the representation of the spin operators in terms of the triplets @xmath37 was introduced in @xcite and reads : @xmath40 @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the fully antisymmetric tensor .",

    "the coupling @xmath12 corresponds to the rung exchange @xmath50 in the spin ladder model , and gives the on - site energy of the triplets ( first term in eq.([h22 ] ) ) .",
    "the rest of the terms in the hamiltonian represent an effective hopping of the triplets , spontaneous creation of two triplets on nearby sites ( second term in eq.([h22 ] ) ) , as well as interactions between the triplets ( eq.([h33 ] ) and eq.([h44 ] ) ) .",
    "in addition , an infinite on - site repulsion @xmath51 is introduced to take into account the hard - core constraint @xmath52 , which has to be satisfied on every site . this condition",
    "( only one triplet can be excited on a site ) follows from quantization of spin and guarantees the one to one correspondence between the spin model eq.([ham ] ) and its effective triplet description eq.([ham1 ] ) .",
    "let us first consider the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) without the @xmath49 term .",
    "a detailed analysis of the spectrum was presented in refs.@xcite an we will only summarize the results here .",
    "the interaction @xmath51 gives the dominant contribution to the renormalization of the triplet spectrum .",
    "it was demonstrated in @xcite that in the brueckner approximation this renormalization is given by the normal self - energy operator @xmath53 where the scattering amplitude is @xmath54 the renormalized spin - wave spectrum @xmath55 , the quasiparticle residue @xmath56 and the bogoliubov parameters @xmath57 , @xmath58 can be found from the solution of the coupled dyson equations for the normal @xmath59 and anomalous @xmath60 green s functions ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 these equations also take into account the quartic interaction , @xmath64 ( [ h44 ] ) , in the lowest order , one - loop approximation .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , in all of the above formulas , and everywhere from now on , we omit the number of lattice sites .",
    "all momenta take values inside the brillouin zone of the original ( non - dimerized ) lattice @xmath65 .",
    "the discrete lattice sums can be converted into integrals by @xmath66 .",
    "the basic approximation made in the derivation of @xmath67 , as discussed in ref.@xcite , is the neglect of all anomalous scattering vertices , which are present in the theory due to the existence of anomalous green s functions ( i.e. quantum fluctuations ) .",
    "all anomalous contributions however are suppressed by the small parameter of the brueckner approach : the density of triplet excitations @xmath68 . as follows from eq.([en ] ) the brueckner self - energy is first order in @xmath29 , while it is easy to prove that all anomalous contributions lead to higher powers of the density @xcite .",
    "this observation justifies the brueckner approximation ( i.e. keeping only eq.([en ] ) ) , since the triplet density is small throughout the disordered phase , even close to @xmath17 .",
    "we find that @xmath69 for @xmath70 , increasing at decreasing dimerizetion @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "now consider the effect of the cubic interaction @xmath49 , eq.([h33 ] ) . in order to incorporate the effect of @xmath49 self - consistently , the normal and anomalous self - energies have to be found to a given order and subsequently inserted into the system of coupled dyson s equations for the anomalous and normal green s functions",
    ". the poles of these green s functions determine the renormalized one - particle spectrum @xcite .",
    "this procedure however is rather involved and in the present work we will use only the lowest order perturbation theory result ( i.e. we will keep one diagram only ) .",
    "this is justified , since we find that the lowest order contribution is relatively small and therefore @xmath49 does not require a fully self - consistent treatment .",

    "only a normal green s function @xmath86 exists for the physical operators @xmath87 , and therefore the self - energy induced by @xmath49 is given , to lowest order , by the two diagrams shown in fig.1 : @xmath88 the correction @xmath89 to the one - particle spectrum is : @xmath90 .",
    "the self - energy ( [ se3 ] ) also gives a correction to the quasiparticle residue : @xmath91 .    in order to find the spectrum , equations ( [ en],[ver],[sp],[ab],[zuv ] ) have to be solved self - consistently for @xmath92 and @xmath93 , which corresponds to an infinite re - summation of diagrams ( solution of dyson s equation ) , and",
    "leads to the renormalized spectrum @xmath94 .",
    "then the correction due to @xmath49 has to be added resulting in the spectrum @xmath95 . in this approximation",
    "the quasiparticle residue is @xmath96 . in the limit @xmath97",
    "all expressions can be easily evaluated analytically to leading order , and for example the corrections , due to @xmath98 are : @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . finally , combining the three - particle corrections with the results of ref.@xcite for the one - particle spectrum without @xmath98 , we obtain in the limit @xmath101 : @xmath102 higher orders also can be evaluated , similarly to ref.@xcite , but we shall not present the lengthy expressions here .    next we present results obtained by numerical self - consistent solution of the dyson s equations . plots of the triplet gap @xmath103 as a function of @xmath7 at @xmath104 are presented in fig.2 .",
    "our results agree quite well with the ed data @xcite .",
    "we also note that our results disagree with those presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the main reason for this is that the three - leg vertices @xmath49 , eq.([ham1 ] ) were not taken into account in ref.@xcite . in figures 4a , b , c ,",
    "d we also present spectra of the elementary triplet @xmath105 for different parameter values .",
    "the agreement with the numerical data ( when available ) is very good .",
    "the approach presented here relies heavily on the effective description of the spin problem in terms of localized triplets . as mentioned in the introduction , in the limit @xmath22 , for any @xmath7",
    ", the spinons , confined to form the triplets , become unconfined .",
    "our calculation clearly breaks down at this point .",
    "we would like to emphasize however , that due to the power law dependence of the radius of confinement @xmath106 on @xmath0 , namely @xmath24 for @xmath107 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 @xcite , the triplets are well localized for @xmath33 .",
    "for @xmath108 the triplet size is about 2 - 3 lattice spacings .",
    "therefore the strong - coupling approach in fact is expected to describe quantitatively well a very wide range of parameter space .",
    "let us also mention that the effective hamiltonian eq.([ham1 ] ) can be used even for @xmath109 , when @xmath106 increases strongly .",
    "however technically the problem becomes much more difficult and truly non - perturbative in nature .",
    "one way to deal with it is to develop a perturbation theory to high order , e.g. via the dimer series expansion @xcite .",
    "physically a finite @xmath106 leads to the creation of a `` string '' ( with length @xmath106 ) of excited triplets .",
    "this string leads to the formation of low - energy many - particle bound states which mix strongly with the one - particle excitations , causing ultimately ( for @xmath110 ) the vanishing of the one - particle spectral weight .",
    "these effects can be taken into account by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in fock space ( spanned by the one - magnon , two - magnon , etc .",
    "a detailed analysis however is beyond the scope of the present work @xcite .",
    "the quartic term eq.([h44 ] ) in the hamiltonian eq.([ham1 ] ) leads to attraction between two elementary triplets .",
    "it has been already demonstrated in the case of a spin ladder @xcite that this attraction is strong enough to form additional singlet ( s=0 ) and triplet ( s=1 ) bound states below the two - particle continuum @xmath111 . here",
    "we will calculate the energies of these additional singlet and triplet states in the ahc model .",
    "such bound states have already been observed in the ed calculations @xcite of the ahc .",
    "consider the scattering of the two triplets : @xmath112 and introduce the total , @xmath113 , and relative , @xmath114 , momenta of the pair .",
    "the two - particle singlet and triplet wave functions are : @xmath115 @xmath116 where @xmath117 are determined from the schrdinger equation , @xmath118 with bound state energy @xmath119 . from this equation",
    "one can readily derive the integral bethe - salpeter equation satisfied by the bound state wave - functions : @xmath120\\psi^{s , t}(q , q)=",
    "\\sum_p m^{s , t}(q , q , p)\\psi^{s , t}(q , p ) .\\ ] ] let us at first neglect the cubic interaction @xmath49 in the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) .",
    "then the scattering amplitudes @xmath121 in the singlet and triplet channels are ( see ref.@xcite ) : @xmath122 , and @xmath123 , respectively .",
    "eq.([bs ] ) should be solved with the substitution @xmath124 in order to take into account that the triplet excitation @xmath125 differs from the bare one @xmath126 , due to the bogoliubov transformation and the quasiparticle residue .",
    "we stress that the solution of the integral equation ( [ bs ] ) in the singlet channel has to satisfy the condition @xmath127 , due to the infinite on - site repulsion .",
    "a lagrange multiplier has to be introduced to enforce this condition .",
    "the normalization constants of the wave functions ( [ singlet],[triplet ] ) are chosen to satisfy the conditions : @xmath128 the solution of eq.([bs ] ) for the triplet and singlet bound states ( [ singlet],[triplet ] ) has already been found in @xcite for the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) without the @xmath49 term . in the leading order in @xmath129",
    "the energies and the wave functions of the bound states are : @xmath130 @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 where we have defined @xmath134 .",
    "next , we analyze how @xmath98 affects the two - particle spectra .",
    "the contribution of the three - particle scattering into binding should change the form of eq.([bs ] ) since it leads to retardation and thus to a non - trivial frequency dependence in the bethe - salpeter equation . in the present work we treat @xmath49 as a perturbation and",
    "find the second order corrections , @xmath135 , to the two - particle bound state energies @xmath136 .",
    "the correction in the singlet channel is given as a sum of the diagrams , shown in fig.3a , b , c , convoluted with the singlet wave function @xmath137 with the vertex @xmath138 and @xmath139 the correction to the triplet energy @xmath140 is given by the diagrams a , b , c , d , e in fig.3 , convoluted with the triplet wave function @xmath141 with the vertices : @xmath142 , @xmath143 @xmath144 and the terms : @xmath145 .    in the leading order in @xmath97",
    "the corrections ( [ dsin],[dtrip ] ) can be easily found analytically : @xmath146 we observe that the contributions ( [ dsin],[dtrip ] ) have an appreciable effect on the two - particle energies and therefore the cubic interaction ( [ h33 ] ) can not be neglected .",
    "it is worth noting that eqs.([bs],[dsin],[dtrip ] ) are not quite correct because they do not take fully into account the hard - core constraint @xmath147 .",
    "let us consider the limit @xmath148 .",
    "a direct expansion in powers of @xmath149 applied to the hamiltonian ( [ ham1 ] ) in coordinate space , gives the following energies for the singlet and triplet bound states :    @xmath150    the hard - core constraint is completely taken into account in these formulas by not allowing hopping processes leading to two triplets occupying the same site . on the other hand the momentum space diagrammatic calculation eqs.([es],[et ] ) and the three - particle correction ( [ mom ] ) result in @xmath151",
    "the physical reason for the difference between the momentum space calculation and the exact real space result is in the additional blocking of virtual excitations which is not included in eqs.([bs],[dsin],[dtrip ] ) .",
    "let us consider one example of such additional blocking .",
    "when we have a state with one triplet , the quasiparticle blocks virtual excitations due to quantum fluctuations , @xmath152 , on two links .",
    "this is the physical origin of the third term in the one - particle dispersion ( [ s0 ] ) .",
    "when we have two excited triplets and they are separated by more than one lattice spacing they block four links ( this corresponds to the third terms in ( [ es],[et ] ) ) .",
    "however when the two triplets are on nearest - neighbor sites they block only three links , which is energetically more favorable and leads to the increase of the binding energy .",
    "this effect represents a non - potential contribution and is not taken into account by the integral equation ( [ bs ] ) .",
    "the additional contribution of the quantum fluctuations into binding is analogous to the calculation of the lamb shift in atomic physics .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that binding due to blocking of quantum fluctuations exists only when the triplets are on nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "we have also identified several additional processes which have to be described more accurately by inserting the vertex ( [ ver ] ) , responsible for the infinite one - site repulsion , into the diagrams presented in fig.3 .",
    "these diagrams should account correctly for the hard - core repulsion between the particles in the initial and intermediate states .",
    "however it is very difficult to identify and calculate in momentum space all diagrams of this type .",
    "we will follow a simpler , effective way to take into account these additional contributions . comparing the coordinate space results ( [ real1],[real2 ] ) with the momentum space calculations ( [ mom1],[mom2 ] ) one can see that the latter can be corrected by adding the following expressions to eqs.([dsin],[dtrip ] ) : @xmath153\\left| \\sum_{k}\\sqrt{2}\\mbox{cos}2k\\psi^s(q , k)\\right|^2 , \\\\ \\label{con1 } & & \\delta e^t_2(q)=\\frac{3\\lambda^2}{8j_\\perp}\\left[-1-\\frac{2 } { 3}\\mbox{cos}2q+\\frac{\\nu^2}{\\lambda^2}\\right]\\left|\\sum_{k } \\sqrt{2}\\mbox{sin}2k\\psi^t(q , k)\\right|^2 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the above equations the expressions in the absolute value signs give the probability amplitudes for two quasiparticles to be on nearest - neighbor sites in the appropriate channel .",
    "finally , to obtain the energies of the triplet and singlet bound states , the integral equation ( [ bs ] ) should be solved first , and then the corrections @xmath154 ( [ dsin],[dtrip ] ) and @xmath155 ( [ con],[con1 ] ) should be added .",
    "results obtained by a self - consistent numerical solution for the spectrum of the singlet and triplet bound states are presented in fig.4 for different values of the frustration , @xmath7 , and dimerization , @xmath0 .",
    "we find that there are no bound states in the vicinity of @xmath156 for zero frustration ( @xmath157 ) .",
    "singlet and triplet bound states are always present in the vicinity of @xmath158 , however the singlet typically exists within a much wider momentum range . at @xmath156",
    "the singlet splits off from the continuum at any non - zero @xmath7 , while the triplet exists only above a certain value of frustration .",
    "one can see also that , quite generally , the singlet is below the triplet , i.e. the binding in the singlet channel is stronger .",
    "we have also calculated the binding energies , @xmath159 , of the singlet and triplet bound states as a function of @xmath0 at @xmath160 for @xmath157 .",
    "the results are presented in fig.5 .",
    "there is excellent agreement with the ed data @xcite in the singlet channel even for @xmath161 , whereas the agreement for the triplet is not so good for @xmath162 .",
    "we attribute this disagreement to the fact that the triplet binding energy is relatively small in comparison with the singlet one for the whole range of parameters ( @xmath163 ) . therefore taking into account the three - particle scattering in simple perturbation theory",
    "is not as good approximation for the triplet as it is for the singlet .",
    "we have performed a more accurate calculation for the cases when the binding energy is very small .",
    "an improvement can be achieved by adding the corrections @xmath164 to the scattering amplitude @xmath121 into the bethe - salpeter integral equation ( [ bs ] ) and further solving the equation to find the binding energies .",
    "such `` self - consistent '' calculations are presented by the dashed lines in fig.5 and one can see that the agreement with the ed data indeed becomes better for small energies .",
    "there are several important points which have been overlooked in ref.@xcite , ultimately leading to incorrect results for the energies of the bound states .",
    "the contribution of the constraint ( [ hu ] ) has not been taken into account in the integral equation ( [ bs ] ) resulting in non - zero binding energy of the singlet at @xmath156 even for large @xmath0 and @xmath157 ( notice that our calculation always gives zero binding at this point ) .",
    "the contribution of the three - particle scattering ( [ h33 ] ) into binding has not been taken into account in ref.@xcite and the effect given by the corrections ( [ con],[con1 ] ) ( lamb shift ) has not been included .",
    "in addition , the error in the calculation of the one - particle spectrum ( see the previous section ) has propagated into the two - particle energies as well .",
    "finally we would like to compare our results for the bound state energies with the lowest order perturbation theory results , presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the binding energy @xmath159 at @xmath165 resulting from ( [ real1],[real2 ] ) and ( [ s0 ] ) in the singlet channel , @xmath166 , is different from the result of ref.@xcite : @xmath167 . in the triplet channel",
    "our result is @xmath168 , which coincides with the formula presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "the one - particle triplet and the triplet bound state can be observed in neutron scattering experiments .",
    "the inelastic neutron scattering cross - section is directly proportional to the dynamic structure factor : @xmath169 here we calculate the spectral weights of the elementary and the additional triplets . after the bond operator ( [ bond ] ) and bogoliubov transformations , the on - site spin operator @xmath170 can be written in momentum space as : @xmath171,\\ ] ] where we have defined the vertices @xmath172 and @xmath173 . then , after averaging , the structure factor can be rewritten in the form @xmath174 where @xmath175 ^ 2\\ ] ] is the spectral weight of the elementary triplet , formally represented by the diagram in fig.6a , and @xmath176 @xmath177 is the contribution of the two - particle triplet bound state , represented by the diagrams in fig.6b . note that in calculations of the spectral weights @xmath178 and @xmath179 the total green s function , including the three particle scattering , should be used , i.e the corrected quasiparticle residue @xmath180 and the total elementary spectrum @xmath95 , should be substituted .",
    "along the disordered line @xmath181 there are no quantum fluctuations ( i.e. @xmath182 ) , and the dependence of @xmath178 and @xmath179 upon @xmath0 is given by the three particle scattering contribution only . in the leading order in @xmath183 , we have calculated the spectral weights analytically : @xmath184 we have also performed a self - consistent numerical evaluation of @xmath178 and @xmath179 using ( [ str1],[str2 ] ) , and the results are presented in fig.7a and fig.7b . for comparison we have also plotted @xmath178 obtained by the dimer series expansion technique @xcite",
    ". the structure factor of the elementary triplet is in excellent agreement with the dimer series results even for @xmath185 . from fig.7a , which shows the case @xmath186 ,",
    "it is clear that for small @xmath7 ( and large @xmath0 ) , the structure factor of the bound state triplet is much smaller than the one for the elementary triplet .",
    "however as @xmath0 decreases the spectral weight of the bound state triplet increases and eventually can even become equal to the one - particle contribution .",
    "in summary , by using self - consistent diagrammatic analysis , we have calculated the one - particle and the two - particle excitation spectra of the dimerized and frustrated antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "the quasiparticle excitations are described as a dilute , strongly - correlated bose gas of triplets .",
    "the important parameter , which controls the validity of the diagrammatic expansion and allows us to re - sum effectively the most important diagrams is the density of triplets .",
    "the latter quantity is quite small for a wide range of parameters , making the technique , presented in this paper , effective for dimerization @xmath1 . for smaller dimerization",
    "the triplets become non - local objects and a more adequate picture would be one of loosely bound spinons .",
    "we emphasize however that the region of applicability of the presented technique is , perhaps even surprisingly , quite large .",
    "the reason for this can be traced to the fact that the quasiparticle weight decreases rather slowly as @xmath0 decreases . indeed , from fig.7a one can see that even for the quite small value @xmath161 the residue is around @xmath187 ( the maximum is chosen to be 0.5 ) .",
    "even though this is true only in the special case without quantum fluctuations , it appears to be qualitatively correct even in the general case .",
    "therefore the triplets are well localized objects with large quasiparticle residue even for rather small values of @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that our results for the spectrum are in excellent agreement with the numerical data , obtained by exact diagonalizations and dimer series expansions , for @xmath188 and higher .",
    "we have presented a detailed diagrammatic analysis of the collective excitations and have found that singlet and triplet bound states of two elementary triplets generally exist below the two - particle continuum . in the absence of frustration there are no bound states in the vicinity of @xmath156 , while both singlet and triplet ones exist at @xmath158 .",
    "finite frustration increases the binding energies of both excitations , making the singlet split off from the continuum at @xmath156 for any @xmath189 , while a finite @xmath7 is required for the triplet bound state to appear .",
    "we have also calculated the contribution of the elementary triplet and the triplet bound state into the structure factor , which is directly measurable in inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
    "we have found that for small @xmath7 and large @xmath0 the bound state contribution is quite small , however it grows with decreasing @xmath0 and can become equal to the quasiparticle contribution .",
    "the technique used in this work is quite similar in spirit to the dimer series expansion , the major difference being that while we re - sum only the most important classes of diagrams , the dimer series contains all of them , but only to a certain ( finite ) order .",
    "let us mention however that at present the dimer series expansion technique has not yet been extended to calculate two - particle properties , such as bound state energies and their contribution into the structure factor @xcite .",
    "this fact makes it worthwhile , in our view , to develop and further refine the technique , presented in this work , especially concerning the two - particle properties of quantum spin models with dimerization , of which the ahc is a particular example .",
    "we are very grateful to zheng weihong , rajiv singh , and anders sandvik for numerous stimulating discussions .",
    "this work was supported by a grant from the australian research council .",
    "strictly speaking there are other diagrams , such as the `` rainbow '' contribution to the anomalous self - energy , which are of the same order in the density .",
    "these additional contributions however are quite small , as discussed in ref.@xcite , and we neglect them here ."
