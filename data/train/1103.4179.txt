    "which involve gluon exchange between quarks , it turns out that this theory is effectively empty , because attention has not been paid to the fact that asymptotic quarks are only found in bound states , and that their transverse coordinates can , in principle , never be exactly determined . in all previous approximate calculations  such as those corresponding to gauge - dependent perturbative approximations , or to a subset of feynman graphs , or to machine calculations wherein gauge - invariance is enforced by breaking up space - time into plaquettes  this difficulty has not been visible ; but for the exact , non - perturbative theory , it becomes clear that quark transverse imprecision must be included as a basic feature of the theory .",
    "the reason for this statement , as well as the relatively simple form of results for each and every qcd amplitude , is due to the novel and unexpected property we call `` effective locality '' ( el ) , which has been shown in ref .",

    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite for details of exact and approximate evaluations of @xmath42 .",
    "the important point we here wish to stress comes from the property of locality @xmath43    we shall call the locality apparent in ( [ eq:9 ] ) `` effective locality '' ( el ) , for it represents a contrast to the way in which ordinary propagators convey information , from one space - time point to another , from @xmath44 to @xmath45 . here , ( [ eq:9 ] ) is the object which replaces the conventional ( perturbative ) propagator @xmath46 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , this locality is shown to hold for a large family of qcd processes ; it simplifies all calculations tremendously , reducing halpern s fi to a finite set of ordinary integrals , which can be studied numerically .",
    "we illustrate the effects of el in this paper by making two simplifications , in the interest of clarity :    1 .   neglect the @xmath47 term compared to @xmath48 , which approximation , in view of ( [ eq:6 ] ) and ( [ eq : chif ] )",
    ", one would make in a strong - coupling limit .",
    "this is just a convenient step for clarity and simplicity of presentation .",
    "most importantly , conclusions are completely independent of this simplification .",
    "the product of the two @xmath48 terms of ( [ eq:8 ] ) contains the self - interactions of each particle , as well as the cross - terms , corresponding to the interactions between the particles .",
    "again , for reasons of simplicity and clarity , we retain only the cross - terms , writing the relevant exponential factor of ( [ eq:8 ] ) as @xmath49 + where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 are variables associated with @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 are with @xmath57 . the last line of ( [ eq:10 ] )",
    "may be written as @xmath58 and one sees that , as a consequence of el , this interaction is associated only with space - time point @xmath44 .",
    "this means that all the other @xmath59 are irrelevant to the interaction , and as a most important consequence , they are removed , along with their normalization factors , leaving dependence only upon the ordinary integral @xmath60 .",
    "further details are given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "the point central to the argument of this article is now being reached , as one seeks to evaluate the support of the second delta - function in ( [ eq:11 ] ) , which it is convenient to display as a product of delta - functions , in time , longitudinal and transverse coordinates , @xmath61    in the cm of q and @xmath2 , one can choose the origin of each time coordinate as the time of their closest approach ; the time difference @xmath62 is then always zero . if the q and @xmath2 are scattering , then @xmath63 , since their longitudinal projections are in opposite directions ; alternatively , if the q and @xmath2 are bound together , then @xmath64 , and their difference vanishes .",
    "either choice makes no difference at all to the following analysis , and the simplest , second possibility can be adopted , that is , @xmath65 .",
    "consider the time - coordinate delta - function , @xmath66 , which can have a zero argument whenever @xmath67 and @xmath68 coincide .",
    "assume this happens at a set of points @xmath69 , so that @xmath70    in a similar way , the longitudinal delta - function may be evaluated as @xmath71    and the product of ( [ eq:13 ] ) and ( [ eq:14 ] ) as , @xmath72    under the restrictions @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "now , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , and @xmath77 and @xmath78 are continuous but otherwise completely arbitrary functions : the probability that the intersections of @xmath68 with @xmath67 and of @xmath79 with @xmath80 occur at exactly the same points is therefore arbitrarily small .",
    "the only place where all four of these continuous functions have the same value is at @xmath81 , where , by definition of these functions , @xmath82 , and hence ( [ eq:15 ] ) reduces to @xmath83    where , it may be noted , corresponding @xmath84 and @xmath85 appearing in ( [ eq:10 ] ) combine with those of ( [ eq:16 ] ) to generate the signs , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which may be specified in comparison with those of an eikonal model .    for being crucial to the main argument of this article",
    ", it matters to support the heuristic derivation given above with a rigorous mathematical proof . since the wiener functional space  @xcite is the most adopted realization of a functional space , the proof will be given in this framework . here",
    ", this space is made out of proper - time parameterized paths : for example , starting from @xmath88 at @xmath89 , one will consider paths passing through @xmath79 at proper - time @xmath900,s]$ ] ; and likewise , paths starting from @xmath91 at @xmath92 and passing through @xmath80 at proper - time @xmath930 , \\bar{s}]$ ] .    following the notation convention of ref .",

    "endowed with the wiener measure @xmath20 , @xmath94 is the measurable space , and with the measure @xmath102 , so is the product space @xmath103 endowed with the topology product , because @xmath104 and @xmath105 are independent .",
    "then , we have the following ,    _ theorem : _    for all pair @xmath1060,{s } ] \\ , \\times \\ , ] 0,\\bar{s}]$ ] , one has @xmath107    whereas @xmath108^{2}=1\\ ] ]    the proof is as follows .",
    "let @xmath109 be the set @xmath110 .",
    "one has @xmath111 , where @xmath112    because of the obvious inclusion , @xmath113    one can write @xmath114    next , one has  @xcite @xmath115    now , since @xmath116 under the integral and get zero , which establishes ( [ eq:16a ] ) , whereas ( [ eq:16b ] ) comes from the normalization procedure of the measure space @xmath117 into a probability space ; the theorem is then demonstrated .",
    "the product of the first two delta distributions of ( [ eq:12 ] ) is therefore proportional to @xmath118 , and further dimensional and symmetry arguments determine the overall multiplicative constant such as in ( [ eq:16 ] ) .",
    "one can observe that this determination of ( [ eq:12 ] ) fits the eikonal approximated evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is the remaining , transverse delta - function of ( [ eq:12 ] ) which is now most relevant , the term @xmath119 , where @xmath120 denotes the impact parameter , or transverse distance between the two particles .",
    "this @xmath121 is sitting in the exponential of ( [ eq:8 ] ) , and the question immediately arises as to what meaning it can be assigned .",
    "depending on its argument , a delta function is either zero or infinite : in the first case this means that there is no interaction , while the second case means that at @xmath122 , one has an infinite phase factor , suggestive of hard disc scattering  @xcite .",
    "the relevant question is therefore why such a delta - function @xmath121 appears at all .",
    "the answer is that the assumption has earlier been made , and in the conventional , abelian way , that the @xmath123 and @xmath124 may be treated as ordinary particles , whereas it is by now well - known that asymptotic @xmath123 and @xmath124 exist only in bound states , and that their transverse coordinates can not be specified with arbitrary precision .",
    "it is therefore unreasonable and unphysical to retain the conventional abelian practice in which such measurement is assumed possible .",
    "this is the interpretation that will be posited here , taking the @xmath121 outcome as a serious warning that some odd working hypothesis has popped out in exactly this way .",
    "one may wonder why this happens in qcd . because qcd possesses el , which conventional abelian theories do not .",
    "the latter display sums over interconnected propagators , which provide a certain vagueness of position , whereas in the exact non - perturbative qcd , as described above and in ref .",
    "@xcite , one finds the sharp determination of delta - functions corresponding to the el property , and transverse imprecision must therefore be introduced separately .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was suggested that this difficulty be treated in an _ ad hoc _ phenomenological way , by replacing @xmath121 by the smoothly varying , effective gaussian @xmath125    where @xmath126 is a mass parameter on the order of the q-@xmath2 bound state ( which we shall call a `` model pion '' ) , although we were able to draw the conclusion of that paper without specifying the precise form of @xmath127 . in this article , we face this question directly , by first developing a formalism in which transverse quark coordinates can not be specified , and then showing how this formalism removes all such absurdities , such as that of the exponential factor of @xmath121 above .",
    "but it must be emphasized that our prescription for such a `` realistic '' qcd is phenomenological , for there remains to be shown how such an approach could be derived from a more fundamental , operator - field version of qcd , in which transverse imprecision would occur automatically , perhaps in relation to a possible non - commutative geometrical phase of non - perturbative qcd  @xcite .    in a following article  @xcite , it will be shown how a specific choice of @xmath127 , slightly but importantly distinguishable from gaussian , can serve to define physically reasonable quark binding , and in a subsequent paper  @xcite , these techniques will be extended to the construction of nucleon - nucleon scattering and binding potentials .",
    "perhaps the simplest way of introducing transverse imprecision is to average that part of the qcd lagrangian dealing with the quark - gluon interaction , so that the transverse position of the color - charge current operator @xmath128 should be averaged over a small range by means of an initially unspecified distribution .",
    "one can also demand the same imprecision for the vector current @xmath129 and scalar density @xmath130 , but these extra requirements seem to complicate the presentation , to no real advantage , and will not be considered here .    instead of the conventional quark - gluon contribution to the lagrangian density , @xmath131 \\ , \\psi,\\end{aligned}\\",

    ", rigorous local gauge - invariance is suppressed for the underlying quark fields , whose quanta have unmeasurable transverse positions , but the hadrons all constructed from these quanta will nevertheless be proper singlets under su(3 ) .",
    "one notes that in the contribution of ( [ eq:18 ] ) to its part of the action operator , @xmath136 , the @xmath137 and @xmath138 coordinates can be interchanged , which yields an equivalent form in which every @xmath6 of the original ( [ eq:17 ] ) is replaced by @xmath139 .",
    "this interchange allows a very simple extraction of all such transverse imprecision , since both delta - functions of ( [ eq:10 ] ) will now be replaced by @xmath140    this can be seen in the simplest way by noting that the presence of a tif @xmath141 shall mean that the difference @xmath142 is effectively bounded by @xmath143 , where @xmath126 appears in the definition of @xmath144 below , and where , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath126 is on the order of the pion mass , @xmath145 .",
    "hence a negligible error is made by replacing the transverse coordinate @xmath146 by @xmath147 .",
    "a more precise justification appears in appendix  [ appb ] .",
    "it should be noted that this approximation concerning the utility of el can be justified in the same way as described in appendix  [ appb ] for both the construction of the quark binding potential and the nucleon - nucleon scattering and binding potential ( the exchange of a gluon bundle across a closed quark loop apparently involves a new set of @xmath148 integrals , and will be discussed elsewhere ) .    the first delta - function of ( [ eq:19 ] ) defines the argument @xmath44 of @xmath149 , and we again observe that the final output of the halpern fi will be an ordinary integral @xmath148 , independent of the choice of @xmath44 .",

    "one might expect that an intuitive choice such as @xmath158 would suffice , but that is not true . by trial and error",
    "it is found that a slight change to @xmath159    with @xmath160 real , positive , and small , @xmath161 , is most appropriate and leads to a binding potential of form @xmath162 , for small @xmath160  @xcite . for the time being , the interpretation of the parameter @xmath160 is quite enigmatic .",
    "there are steps in the derived expression for @xmath163 where @xmath160 may be neglected compared to unity ; but @xmath160 can not be set equal to zero .",
    "and @xmath160 is not a coupling constant , for even when small , its effect on the q-@xmath2 binding is large .",
    "it would seem that , in some sense , @xmath160 has something to do with the transverse correlations between bound quarks and/or antiquarks . in this respect",
    "it is worth noticing that ( [ levy ] ) is a part of a levy - flight probability distribution  @xcite . at this point ,",
    "a part of the enigma is precisely how such correlations would emerge from the assumed transverse imprecision of the quark field operators .",
    "one other point deserves mention concerning the scale change used when @xmath164 in the exponent of the halpern representation is broken up into small cells of volume @xmath165 : @xmath166    upon rescaling , @xmath167 , and re - expressing all interactions in terms of @xmath168 , there appears in ( [ eq:10 ] ) the factor @xmath169 . in ref .",
