    "in a financial market allowing for the dynamic trading of a riskless asset , normalized to unity , and some given underlying assets without restrictions , the fundamental theorem of asset pricing essentially states that the absence of arbitrage opportunities is equivalent to the existence of a probability measure under which the underlying asset process is a martingale .",
    "see kreps @xcite , harrison and pliska @xcite and delbaen and schachermayer @xcite .",
    "then , for the purpose of hedging , the only relevant information is the quadratic variation of the assets price process under such a martingale measure . without any further assumption on the quadratic variation",
    ", the robust superhedging cost reduces to an obvious bound which can be realized by static trading on the underlying assets ; see cvitani , pham and touzi @xcite and frey @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we examine the problem of superhedging , under the condition of no - arbitrage , when the financial market allows for the static trading of european call options in addition to the dynamic trading of the underlying asset with price process @xmath0 . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case where all available european call options have the same maturity @xmath1 .",
    "however , we idealize the financial market assuming that such european call options are available for all possible strikes . under the linearity ( and continuity )",
    "assumption , this means that although the joint distribution @xmath2 of the process @xmath3 is unknown , the modeler has access to the function @xmath4 $ ] , and therefore to the marginal distribution @xmath5 of the random variable @xmath6 , as observed by breeden and litzenberger @xcite . in particular , any @xmath1-maturity vanilla derivative , with payoff @xmath7",
    ", can be perfectly replicated by a portfolio of european calls , and has an unambiguous no - arbitrage price @xmath8 , as long as @xmath9 , which can be expressed as a linear combination of the given prices of the underlying calls .",
    "this problem is classically approached in the literature by means of the skorohod embedding problem ( sep ) which shows up naturally due to the dambis ",
    "schwarz time change result .",
    "however , only some special cases of derivatives are eligible for this approach , namely those defined by a payoff which is invariant under rime change .",
    "the use of the sep techniques to solve the robust superhedging problem can be traced back to the seminal paper by hobson @xcite .",
    "the survey paper by hobson @xcite is very informative and contains the relevant references on the subject . for a derivative security @xmath10 written on an underlying asset @xmath3 ,",
    "the idea is to search for a function @xmath11 and a martingale @xmath12 such that @xmath13 so that @xmath14\\leq\\int\\lambda\\,d\\mu$ ] for all stopping times @xmath15 such that @xmath16 has the distribution @xmath5 determined from european call options , as outlined above .",
    "the bound is then obtained by designing @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath15 such that @xmath17 .    in this paper",
    ", we develop an alternative approach which relates the robust superhedging problem to the literature on stochastic control ; see fleming and soner  @xcite .",
    "our approach consists of solving directly the robust superhedging problem whose solution provides the above function @xmath11 and martingale @xmath12 . as a  consequence , unlike the sep approach which requires that the payoff of the exotic to be invariant under time change , there is no restriction on the class of derivative securities as the time change step is avoided .",
    "moreover , our methodology is related to the optimal transportation theory , and in fact opens the door to an original new ramification in this theory by imposing naturally that the transportation be performed along a continuous martingale .",
    "our first main result , reported in sections  [ sect - superhedge ] and [ sect - superhedgecall ] , provides a formulation of the robust superhedging problem based on the kantorovich duality in the spirit of benamou and brenier @xcite ; see villani @xcite .",
    "a finite dimensional version of this dual formulation was already used by davis , oblj and raval @xcite .",
    "also , this duality is implicitly proved for special cases of derivatives in the previous literature based on the sep .",
    "so the importance of our duality result lies in its generality . moreover , similar to the sep approach , the solution of the dual problem provides the corresponding optimal hedging strategy and worst case model . finally , the dual formulation is suitable for numerical approximation techniques as shown by bonnans and tan @xcite and tan and touzi @xcite .",
    "our next concern is to show that this duality result is not merely a theoretical result , but may be applied to compute things in practice . in this paper",
    ", this is demonstrated in the context of lookback derivatives , where the robust superhedging problem is known to be induced by the azma ",
    "yor solution of the sep .",
    "a semi - static hedging strategy corresponding to this bound was produced by hobson @xcite .",
    "our second main result , reported in section  [ sect - lookback ] , reproduces this bound by means of our dual formulation . in particular , this provides a new presentation of the fact that the azma  yor solution of the sep realizes the upper bound for a certain class of lookback options .",
    "we also recover in section  [ sect - forwardlookback ] the robust superhedging cost for the forward lookback option which was also derived in hobson  @xcite .",
    "the results of sections  [ sect - lookback ]  and  [ sect - forwardlookback ] are not new , and are reported here in order to show that the optimal transportation approach is suitable to recover these known results . beyond rediscovering the formerly derived results in the literature",
    ", we would like to insist on the fact that the present optimal transportation approach complements the sep approach by putting the emphasis on the superhedging problem whose solution provides the optimal semi - static superhedging strategy .",
    "this feature is perfectly illustrated in the related paper @xcite , where :    this approach is used in order to provide the optimal semi - static superhedging strategy ;    by using the optimal semi - static superhedging strategy from ( i ) , oblj and spoida @xcite prove an extension of the azma ",
    "yor solution of the sep to the case of multiple intermediate marginals .",
    "the final outcome from @xcite is an extension of the previous results of brown , hobson and rogers @xcite and madan and yor @xcite .",
    "we also observe that one should not expect to solve explicitly the problem of robust superhedging , in general .",
    "therefore , an important advantage of the optimal transportation approach is that the corresponding dual formulation is suitable for numerical approximation techniques ; see bonnans and tan @xcite for the case of variance options , and tan and touzi @xcite for a class of optimal transportation problems motivated by this paper .",
    "finally , we would like to emphasize that by expressing the robust bound as the value function of a superhedging problem , we are implicitly addressing the important issue of no - arbitrage under model uncertainty , as discussed in the previous literature ; see , for example , cox and oblj @xcite and davis , oblj and raval @xcite . indeed",
    ", if an arbitrage does exist , under some conveniently defined weak form , the value function would be infinite .",
    "conversely , whenever the value function is finite , the financial market would either admit a genuine model - free arbitrage , if existence holds for the dual problem , or some convenient notion of weak arbitrage otherwise .",
