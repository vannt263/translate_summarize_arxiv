    "the two - dimensional spin-1/2 quantum kagome antiferromagnet ( qka ) has been early recognized as an ideal candidate for stabilizing a spin - liquid state.@xcite the possibility of generating fractionalized excitations such as spinons and the nature itself of its ground state ( gs ) have been hotly debated over the last 20 years with proposals of many competing states  gapped@xcite and gapless@xcite spin liquids , as well as valence - bond solids.@xcite while the most recent calculations clearly point to a gapped spin - liquid gs,@xcite likely a resonating valence bond ( rvb ) state , the few experimental realizations have been found gapless,@xcite thus apparently contradicting this scenario .",
    "it is commonly advocated that the issue of opposing experimental findings and theoretical predictions results from weak perturbing interactions in the context of a gs manifold of the isotropic heisenberg exchange .",
    "the most deeply studied case is that of the out - of - plane dzyaloshinsky - moriya ( dm ) magnetic anisotropy@xcite @xmath3 that is present in any real qka as the bonds lack inversion symmetry and is theoretically predicted to create a quantum critical point ( qcp ) at @xmath4.@xcite this separates a moment - free phase ( @xmath5 ) from a nel - ordered phase ( @xmath6).@xcite the mineral herbertsmithite , @xmath7-zncu@xmath0(oh)@xmath8cl@xmath1 , believed so far to be the best realization of the qka,@xcite appears to be a spin liquid @xcite sustaining spinon excitations,@xcite in line with its dm anisotropy @xmath9.@xcite its location in the region close to the qcp is likely responsible for observed field- @xcite and pressure - induced @xcite freezing .",
    "this theoretical scenario awaits further validation , potentially by finding new compounds lying in the nel - ordered region of the phase diagram .    in this context",
    ", the mineral vesignieite , bacu@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2(oh)@xmath1 , which has been recently highlighted as a new realization of the qka,@xcite is an appealing case .",
    "it crystallizes in the monoclinic space group@xcite @xmath10 and the minute 0.07% bond - length difference due to two inequivalent cu@xmath11 sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) makes the triangles very close to being equilateral.@xcite indeed , there have been suggestions that the actual structure has equilateral symmetry,@xcite though this may not yet be conclusive.@xcite the magnetism of vesignieite is dominated by the nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction@xcite @xmath12  k that leads to a maximum in local susceptibility @xmath13 at the temperature @xmath14,@xcite detected by nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) . in marked contrast to herbertsmithite , vesignieite shows a magnetic transition@xcite to a @xmath15 nel state at @xmath16  k. during this spin freezing transition , an additional out - of - plane spin component creates a zfc / fc bifurcation .",
    "based on the width of electron - spin - resonance ( esr ) spectra@xcite vesignieite has been suggested to possess large dm anisotropy @xmath3 and thus to be in the ordered region of the phase diagram.@xcite since vesignieite appears to be the first clear case of a long - range ordered qka and no proper attempt to identify and quantify its magnetic anisotropy has been reported , a detailed study is essential .    in this paper , we clarify the driving force of magnetic ordering in vesignieite by determining its dominant magnetic anisotropy . employing the local - probe esr technique",
    "we show that the in - plane component of the dominant dm anisotropy , @xmath17 , exceeds @xmath3 , in contrast to herbertsmithite .",
    "we propose that such a dm vector crucially suppresses quantum fluctuations and thus critically affects the gs of this material .",
    "additionally , we assess the importance of a symmetric anisotropic exchange ( ae ) that has recently been suggested as an important spin - hamiltonian component of herbertsmithite.@xcite",
    "our esr experiments were conducted at 328.8  ghz on a custom - made spectrometer working in transmission mode at the nhmfl , tallahassee , usa , allowing single field - sweep detection of spectra with negligible background .",
    "the sample was hydrothermally annealed powder similar to that used in previous studies.@xcite",
    "esr has proven extremely efficient for determining magnetic anisotropy , either by detecting collective excitations,@xcite or through the modeling of shifts@xcite and line widths@xcite of a paramagnetic resonance .",
    "both , the shifts and widths are non - zero only when the anisotropy is finite.@xcite they allow distinction of different forms of the anisotropy and its direct quantification .    in an esr experiment",
    "a magnetic system is exposed to the applied static magnetic field @xmath18 and an electromagnetic wave with polarization of its magnetic field perpendicular to @xmath18 ( conventional faraday configuration ) . within the linear response theory",
    "the absorption spectrum @xmath19 is proportional to the imaginary part of the dynamical susceptibility,@xcite @xmath20 and thus effectively measures spin correlations in the direction perpendicular to the applied field , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 denotes canonical averaging and @xmath23 is the @xmath24-component of the total spin operator .    calculating the time - dependent spin operator in the heisenberg representation @xmath25 for a general spin hamiltonian @xmath26 is a nontrivial problem .",
    "therefore , a few approximate solutions have been developed .",
    "the well - established kubo - tomita ( kt ) approach@xcite relies on dividing the spin hamiltonian into two parts , @xmath27 , where the first , dominant part @xmath28 contains only the zeeman term and the heisenberg isotropic exchange ( @xmath29 ) , while the magnetic anisotropy term @xmath30 is treated as a perturbation .",
    "the latter then determines the shape of the esr spectrum ( its position and width ) , because @xmath28 possessing su(2 ) symmetry conserves the total magnetization and therefore leads to a @xmath31-function resonance at the field @xmath18 . for finite @xmath30 , at high temperatures ( @xmath32 )",
    "the kt theory predicts a lorentzian exchange - narrowed@xcite esr absorption line with the full - width - half - maximum line width@xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 [ s^{-},\\mathcal{h}^{\\prime } ] \\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle s^{+}s^{-}\\right\\rangle},\\\\ m_{4}&=\\frac{\\left\\langle \\left [ \\mathcal{h}-\\mathcal{h}_{z},\\left [ \\mathcal{h}^{\\prime } , s^{+}\\right ] \\right ] [ \\mathcal{h}-\\mathcal{h}_{z},\\left [ \\mathcal{h}^{\\prime } , s^{-}\\right ] ] \\right\\rangle } { \\left\\langle s^{+}s^{-}\\right\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the second and the fourth moment of the absorption line , respectively , with @xmath35 $ ] denoting a commutator , @xmath36 is a constant of the order of unity ( see below ) , @xmath37 stands for the boltzman constant and @xmath38 for the bohr magneton .",
    "the expression  ( [ eqs2 ] ) is valid if the magnetic anisotropy is small compared to @xmath28 and if spin diffusion is negligible , which is generally the case in spin systems with dimensionality exceeding one.@xcite strictly speaking , the esr absorption line is never truly lorentzian , as all of its moments , given by the spin hamiltonian , are always finite while they diverge for the lorentzian line shape . in systems with strong isotropic exchange compared to magnetic anisotropy deviations from the lorentzian shape",
    "occur only in far wings of the resonance and an approximate line shape that is a product of the lorentzian and a broad gaussian @xmath39,@xcite with @xmath40 being the exchange field , is applicable .",
    "this then yields @xmath41 .",
    "in fig .  [ fig2](a )",
    "we show derivative esr spectra typical of those recorded in the @xmath42-range between 3 and 300  k. the spectra have similar width as in herbertsmithite,@xcite suggesting that substantial magnetic anisotropy is also present in vesignieite .",
    "in addition to this broad component , we observe a narrow component with the principal @xmath43-factors values of 2.05 and 2.25 , typical of cu@xmath11 ions.@xcite we attribute this narrow component to a minor impurity phase since its intensity at 300  k amounts to only 0.3% of the broad - component intensity and exhibits a curie - like @xmath42-dependence .",
    "the impurity signal is thus much too small to explain the substantial low-@xmath42 increase of the bulk susceptibility @xmath44 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] .",
    "the esr intensity of the broad component , @xmath45 , convincingly follows @xmath44 [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) ] , and not the nonmonotonic intrinsic @xmath13 .",
    "this has an important implication for the hitherto unknown origin of the low-@xmath42 increase of @xmath44.@xcite indeed , the observation of a single broad - component esr line , rather than two distinct lines , reveals that the spins contributing to @xmath44 are necessarily exchange coupled with the intrinsic cu@xmath11 spins .",
    "bond disorder due to oxygen vacancies or some other non - stoichiometry effect then provides a credible explanation for the mismatch between @xmath44 and @xmath13 .",
    "such disorder also explains the inhomogeneous broadening of the @xmath46v nmr lines far above @xmath47.@xcite    for the magnetic field applied perpendicular ( @xmath48 ) and within the kagome plane ( @xmath49 ) we find @xmath50 . as the local anisotropy axis , set by the direction of the the shortened cu - o(1 ) bond [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] , makes the angle of @xmath51 with the kagome plane , the principal @xmath43-factor value @xmath52 along the apical direction is smaller than the value @xmath53 in the perpendicular direction .",
    "this confirms that the cu@xmath11 orbital state involves occupation of the @xmath54 state@xcite rather than the more common @xmath55 orbital that would lead to @xmath56.@xcite      in order to determine the @xmath42-evolution of the esr line width and its origin we first fitted the experimental spectra [ fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] to a powder - averaged line shape based on a field distribution originating from the @xmath43-factor anisotropy @xmath57 that is convoluted with a lorentzian function with the phenomenological line width @xmath58 . here",
    "@xmath59 denotes the polar angle between the applied magnetic field and the normal to the plane .",
    "the presumed independence of both @xmath43 and @xmath60 on the azimuthal angle stems from the near threefold rotational symmetry of the lattice .",
    "our approach elaborates on the previous esr report that employed a simpler analysis yielding only an average @xmath60 and @xmath43-factor.@xcite    the esr line width in vesignieite  exhibits a minimum at @xmath61  k and increases linearly with @xmath42 at least up to 300  k , i.e. , @xmath62 [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) ] .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to herbertsmithite  where it was found constant for @xmath63.@xcite in general , dying out of spin correlations above the characteristic exchange temperature @xmath29 causes a vanishing contribution to the esr line width .",
    "similar linearly increasing esr line width at surprisingly high temperatures ( @xmath32 ) was observed in localized - spin systems on several instances.@xcite such behavior can arise either from the phonon modulation of the anisotropic exchange@xcite or the crystalline field , the latter for @xmath64.@xcite we therefore attribute the observed behavior in vesignieite  to an additional line - broadening mechanism that arises from a spin - phonon coupling and is due to a direct phonon process yielding the linearly increasing esr relaxation due to phonon modulation of magnetic anisotropy.@xcite we propose that the linear increase might be related to a structural instability of vesignieite  associated with the energetic proximity of the monoclinic crystal structure to the higher - symmetry rhombohedral ( @xmath65 ) structure , the latter with a perfectly undistorted kagome lattice.@xcite    in cases of the phonon - induced esr broadening the line width is regularly written as a sum of a temperature independent and a linearly increasing contribution .",
    "such division is justified for relaxation mechanisms that contribute independently to the relaxation of the spin correlation function @xmath21 , whose decay is close to being exponential ( for close - to lorentzian line shapes ) , as regularly encountered in concentrated magnetic insulators .",
    "the usual subtraction of the linearly increasing line - width contribution in vesignieite  gives the width intrinsic to the kagome spin system .",
    "its increase with decreasing @xmath42 below @xmath66 is similar to that observed in herbertsmithite  and can be attributed to the building - up of spin correlations , which are also responsible for the maximum in @xmath13 at 25  k.@xcite in order to determine the magnetic anisotropy , we therefore make use of the 40  k spectrum , which corresponds well to the paramagnetic limit , as both the spin - phonon and the spin - correlation induced broadenings are small . moreover , since @xmath45 is not much different from @xmath13 at 40  k we do not expect any notable effect of the bond disorder on the 40  k esr spectrum.@xcite    in this paramagnetic limit , we model the esr line - width anisotropy @xmath67 by employing the kubo - tomita moment approach [ eq .  ( [ eqs2 ] ) ] . both , the dm magnetic anisotropy [ fig.[fig1](b ) ] @xmath68 and the traceless symmetric anisotropic exchange [ fig.[fig1](c ) ] , written in a local basis as @xmath69 , \\label{ae}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] yield the line width of the general form @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the @xmath43-factor averaged over the basic hexagon of the kagome lattice , and the constants @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 are related to the anisotropy constants of each model [ see eqs .  ( [ dmwidth ] ) ,  ( [ aewidth ] ) in the appendix  [ appa ] ) . although this angular dependence is more complicated than the phenomenological one employed above , their differences are minimal ( see appendix  [ appb ] ) , assuring that the @xmath42-dependences of all esr parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are meaningful .",
    "fitting the experimental spectrum to the powder - averaged line shape with the line width given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) provides fits of equal quality for both models .",
    "these are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] together with @xmath76 maps spanned over the parameter space . for the dm model",
    ", we find the solution @xmath77 , @xmath78 , while the ae model yields two inequivalent solutions , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the relative sizes of the dm and ae anisotropy are very similar with respect to the dominant exchange @xmath29 . since the dm interaction results from a first order correction of @xmath29 in the spin - orbit coupling , which is for the cu@xmath11 ions a @xmath8310% perturbation on @xmath29,@xcite",
    "while the ae interaction is a second - order correction , the dm interaction is generally considered dominant .",
    "however , caution is necessary as @xmath17 , the largest anisotropy in the dm model in vesignieite , is reducible on the kagome lattice.@xcite this is because it possesses a hidden symmetry@xcite and can be transformed into an effective term of the order @xmath84 by applying a nonuniform spin rotation.@xcite therefore , we provide a second criterion that is based on the esr line shift , which allows distinction between the two anisotropy models in vesignieite .      when the anisotropy is smaller than the isotropic exchange , as is the case here , nagata s theory@xcite of the esr line shift can be applied .",
    "accordingly , the shift of the @xmath43-factor from its infinite-@xmath42 value @xmath85 is given by the first moment,@xcite @xmath86 \\right ] \\right\\rangle}/{2\\mu_b b_0\\left\\langle s^z\\right\\rangle}$ ] .",
    "it is important to stress that in this first - order calculation ( in @xmath30 ) the dm interaction leads to zero shift,@xcite while the shift due to the ae interaction scales with the susceptibility @xmath87 in the paramagnetic regime,@xcite @xmath88 here @xmath89 denotes the component of the ae tensor along the applied field and @xmath90 in two perpendicular directions , @xmath91 is the avogadro number and @xmath92 the vacuum permeability . quantifying this expression in vesignieite  with the above - determined ae parameters , we arrive at the scalings @xmath93  ( emu / mol  cu)@xmath94 and @xmath95  ( emu / mol  cu)@xmath94 for the two relevant directions .",
    "these values significantly overestimate the measured esr shifts that are found constant for @xmath96  k within much smaller error bars [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] .",
    "the @xmath97 data limit the ae anisotropy to at least 4-times smaller values .",
    "therefore , the esr line width , which scales with the square of the anisotropy , is entirely determined by the dominant dm interaction .",
    "the experimental esr shift becomes sizable below 25  k [ fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) ] , which was ascribed previously to short - range ordering effects.@xcite however , due to the traceless nature of the ae interaction it is generally expected that even in the short - range correlated regime the esr shift will exhibit both positive and negative shifts for different directions of the applied field,@xcite just as occurs at higher @xmath42 .",
    "this is not the case , therefore , we attribute the solely positive low-@xmath42 @xmath43-shifts to local inhomogeneity present in vesignieite .",
    "namely , in inhomogeneous systems ( e.g. , impure systems and systems with several inequivalent sites ) spatially varying local fields exclusively lead to positive @xmath43-shifts@xcite that stem from the @xmath98 fourier components of the inhomogeneous field.@xcite this corroborates our proposition , based on the scaling of @xmath45 with @xmath44 , that there is significant bond disorder in vesignieite .",
    "although , in both herbertsmithite  and in vesignieite  the esr spectra can be accounted for by the dm magnetic anisotropy , we point out an essential difference . while the out - of - plane dm component @xmath3 is dominant in herbertsmithite,@xcite it is the in - plane component @xmath17 that dominates in vesignieite .",
    "we additionally note that the kubo - tomita approach generally underestimates the strength of the reducible @xmath17 component with respect to the irreducible @xmath3 component .    then , it is important to inspect the effect of both dm components on the gs of the qka .",
    "although in the classical limit both components immediately lead to magnetic ordering , their effect is rather different.@xcite the gs due solely to the @xmath3 component is an in - plane 120@xmath99 spin structure invariant under a global rotation around the @xmath48 axis , while a finite @xmath17 component prefers a state with a finite uniform out - of - plane spin component , thus removing this state from the gs manifold of the heisenberg hamiltonian by eliminating the rotation symmetry . for @xmath100 , the tilt @xmath101 of each spin from the kagome plane caused by @xmath17",
    "is given by @xmath102,@xcite which yields @xmath103 in vesignieite .",
    "interestingly , the weak ferromagnetic spin component estimated by nmr@xcite amounts to 0.05 - 0.12  @xmath38 , which together with the dominant in - plane component being larger than 0.6  @xmath38 limits the tilting angle to @xmath104 . in the quantum picture@xcite nel ordering is induced by @xmath3 only for @xmath105 . including a finite @xmath17 in this case leads to a weak ferromagnetic moment in the @xmath48 direction that is still linear in @xmath106 as in the classical case,@xcite while the position of the qcp would be affected by the @xmath84 term as well as linear terms in the ae anisotropy . in vesignieite , the condition @xmath107 , could profoundly affect the qcp because @xmath17 disfavors spin structures from the gs manifold of the isotropic @xmath29 and should therefore be much more efficient in suppressing quantum fluctuations than @xmath3 .",
    "this could explain why magnetic ordering in vesignieite  occurs at surprisingly high temperature @xmath108 , despite possessing very similar @xmath109 as herbertsmithite .",
    "comprehensive theoretical investigations of the general dm - perturbed phase diagram of the qka are thus highly desired .",
    "employing the esr line - width and line - shift analyses we have shown that the in - plane dm interaction is prevailing in the novel qka vesignieite  and is most likely responsible for its magnetic ordering below @xmath16",
    "k. we have detected intrinsic inhomogeneity of the kagome planes , which we attribute to bond disorder , as well as sizable spin - phonon contribution that might be related to a lattice instability .",
    "last , we note that a preliminary analysis of the esr line@xcite of herbertsmithite  with the ae model yields anisotropy constants @xmath110 and @xmath111 that give an `` effective '' ae anisotropy of @xmath112 if averaged over the triangle .",
    "this value is notably smaller than the recent estimate @xmath113,@xcite which would lead to much broader esr lines since their width scales with the square of the anisotropy . increasing the sensitivity by performing single - crystal esr and applying the above - presented analysis is likely the most reliable approach for resolving the standing issue of the dominant anisotropy in herbertsmithite , which could turn to be the crucial milestone in understanding its spin - liquid properties .",
