    "<S> resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) at the @xmath0-edge of transition metal elements is now commonly used to probe single magnon excitations . here </S>",
    "<S> we show that single magnon excitations can also be measured with rixs at the @xmath1-edge of the surrounding ligand atoms when the center heavy metal elements have strong spin - orbit coupling . </S>",
    "<S> this is demonstrated with oxygen @xmath1-edge rixs experiments on the perovskite sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 , where low energy peaks from single magnon excitations were observed . </S>",
    "<S> this new application of rixs has excellent potential to be applied to a wide range of magnetic systems based on heavy elements , for which the @xmath0-edge rixs energy resolutions in the hard x - ray region is usually poor .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords : single magnon excitation , rixs , oxygen @xmath1-edge , iridates _ </S>",
    "<S> +    recently , the resonant inelastic x - ray scattering technique has achieved great progress in condensed matter physics research @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has now been clearly demonstrated that rixs is not only suitable for studying charge and orbital excitations , but it is also a powerful tool to probe magnetic dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> with rixs at the @xmath0-edge of the magnetic elements , the magnetic dispersion curves were mapped out on various transition metal compounds such as cuprates @xcite and iridates @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> although the leading term of the photon - electron interaction does not directly couple to the spin , the strong spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) of the core level _ p _ </S>",
    "<S> states accessed at the @xmath0-edge makes direct spin - flip scattering possible in the rixs process @xcite . combined with the large energy transfer and appreciable momentum transfer capability of x - ray scattering </S>",
    "<S> , this makes rixs an attractive tool to measure magnetic dispersions , especially in situations where small sample volumes make inelastic neutron scattering difficult to apply .    depending on the resonant energy of the targeted element , rixs </S>",
    "<S> is naturally divided into two classes : soft x - ray and hard x - ray @xcite . in a soft rixs setup , </S>",
    "<S> x - ray dispersing elements are diffraction gratings , which typically operate efficiently in an x - ray energy range up to about 2000 ev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-edges of the @xmath4 transition metal elements all fall below this energy scale . for high atomic number , @xmath5 , transition metal elements , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-edge resonant energies are in the hard x - ray region and the rixs setup is totally different . instead of continuously tunable gratings , high quality single crystals are needed as the key optical elements . </S>",
    "<S> the rixs resolution crucially depends on the availability of a high quality single crystal with a bragg diffraction peak close to back - scattering at the energy of the @xmath0-edge of the targeted element . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement severely limits the application of rixs , and thus by far the majority of hard x - ray rixs studies of single spin - flip magnetic excitations have focused on @xmath6 iridates @xcite .    to overcome this resolution limitation </S>",
    "<S> , we suggest that it is possible to probe single magnon excitations with rixs at the @xmath1-edge of the surrounding ligand atoms whose @xmath7 orbitals hybridize with the @xmath8 orbitals of a heavy element . in this rixs process </S>",
    "<S> , a @xmath9 core electron of the ligand atom is excited into the outer level @xmath7 states and the @xmath8 shell electronic configuration of the transition metal element is altered through the @xmath7-@xmath8 hybridization . </S>",
    "<S> the key ingredient to flip a spin , namely the strong spin - orbit coupling , is fulfilled by the @xmath8 electrons of the high @xmath5 index transition metal elements instead of the 1@xmath10 core level of the ligand atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the energy resolution at the @xmath1-edge of the common ligand atoms is often particularly high . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the best energy resolution currently achieved for rixs at the oxygen @xmath1-edge in the soft x - ray region is about 50  mev @xcite , which is much better than the majority of @xmath6 elements probed using @xmath0-edge rixs in the hard x - ray region . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore the energy resolution is set to improve significantly in coming years due to the development of new soft x - ray rixs beamlines @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for demonstration , we carried out oxygen @xmath1-edge rixs experiments on the perovskite sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this material is antiferromagnetically ordered at low temperature ( @xmath11  k ) , and its spin - wave magnetic dispersion has been mapped out in detail using ir @xmath12-edge rixs @xcite . by measuring the rixs spectrum at the oxygen @xmath1-edge , peaks consistent with single magnon excitations were observed . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that the oxygen @xmath1-edge rixs is a powerful tool in probing the magnetic excitations in 5@xmath8 transition metal oxides .    </S>",
    "<S> the oxygen @xmath1-edge rixs experiments were performed using the aerha instrument at the sextants beamline at the soleil synchrotron in france @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 samples were 200  nm thick epitaxial films deposited on srtio@xmath13 substrates using pulsed laser deposition @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the sample was orientated such that the tetragonal crystal axes @xmath14 and @xmath15   were in the scattering plane . </S>",
    "<S> all data were collected at 25  k and the rixs spectra were taken with the detector at a fixed scattering angle of @xmath16 .    for different incident x - ray polarization , the x - ray couples to ir @xmath6 orbitals differently , which gives rise to different pre - peak features at the oxygen @xmath1-edge absorption curve @xcite . to maximize the cross - section , we chose the excitation into the @xmath17 and @xmath18 ir orbitals via the in - plane oxygen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> the resonant energy of these excitations is determined by oxygen @xmath1-edge total electron yield spectra , shown in figure  [ fig : tey ] . </S>",
    "<S> the data were collected with the incident x - ray polarization vector to be 15 degrees away from surface normal . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is mainly along the crystal @xmath19 direction . </S>",
    "<S> the pre - peak at 529.5  ev ( indicated by a dashed line ) is the excitation of in - plane oxygen @xmath9 core electron in to the ir @xmath17 and @xmath18 orbitals via @xmath7-@xmath8 hybridization .    </S>",
    "<S> -edge taken with the incident x - ray polarization vector to be @xmath20 away from surface normal . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line indicates the prepeak at 529.5  ev.,width=8 ]    with the incident x - ray energy at 529.5 ev on the prepeak at the oxygen @xmath1-edge , the rixs spectra were taken with the detector at a fixed scattering angle of @xmath16 . by rotating the sample @xmath21 angle , </S>",
    "<S> the total momentum transfer , , varies in the @xmath22-@xmath0 plane as @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the relative angle between the incident    -@xmath8 transition and higher energy features are dominated by fluorescence.,width=8 ]    x - ray polarization and the scattered beam directions @xcite , the intensity of elastic scattering in soft x - ray rixs measurements can sometimes be much weaker than the inelastic rixs intensity @xcite . in cases like these </S>",
    "<S> it can be difficult to unambiguously determine the exact elastic energy in the rixs spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> therefore for each point measured in the experiments , we first used a circularly polarized incident beam to get appreciable elastic line signal to precisely calibrate the zero energy loss definition on the ccd detector . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in figure  [ fig : circular ] . except the sharp elastic line at zero energy loss </S>",
    "<S> , there is a peak at 0.66  ev and multiple features above 2  ev . </S>",
    "<S> the peak at 0.66  ev corresponds to the @xmath8-@xmath8 transition whose energy is consistent with that observed with ir @xmath0-edge rixs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> features at higher energy are mainly from the oxygen @xmath1-edge fluorescence .    </S>",
    "<S> to better observe the low energy excitations , such as magnons , the overwhelming contribution from the elastic line needs to be minimized . </S>",
    "<S> this was done by switching to a @xmath24 polarized incident beam . with the @xmath24 incident polarization , </S>",
    "<S> the non - spin - flipped scattering process is strictly forbidden at the scattering angle of @xmath25 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since our detector was placed close this ( @xmath16 ) , the elastic line was largely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig : qdep ] plots rixs spectra collected at this condition . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the elastic scattering is almost invisible , and low energy excitation peaks appear .     </S>",
    "<S> incident polarization . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed line is with circular polarization , as shown in figure [ fig : circular].,width=8 ]    since the magnetic interactions in sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 are almost completely two dimensional , we index the momentum transfer with only its @xmath22 component . for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , </S>",
    "<S> the low energy peaks are at 52 and 44  mev respectively , with an error bar of 10  mev ( estimated from half of the scanning step size ) . </S>",
    "<S> these energies agree very well with the magnon dispersion measured earlier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we conclude that the observed low energy peaks are from single magnon excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the observed low energy magnon excitation shows distinct dependence : its intensity quickly reduces when the in - plane momentum transfer moves towards @xmath28 . for the other two points closer to @xmath29 , the magnon excitations are barely observable </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is consistent with recent theoretical calculations by b. h. kim _ </S>",
    "<S> et al_.  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> they predict that oxygen @xmath1-edge rixs measurements of single magnons in sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 have a minimum in intensity at @xmath28 , and its size is governed by the buckling of the ir - o - ir bond angle . </S>",
    "<S> the agreement with this theoretical prediction further confirms that the observed low energy peaks are indeed from single magnon excitations .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we show that single magnon excitations in antiferromagnetically ordered sr@xmath2iro@xmath3 can be probed with rixs at the @xmath1-edge of the ligand oxygen atoms . </S>",
    "<S> this technique helps to overcome the resolution limitation of @xmath0-edge rixs in the hard x - ray region for high @xmath5 index transition metal compounds . </S>",
    "<S> it has excellent potential to be applied to a wide range of magnetic systems based on heavy elements , and crucially , it is furthermore possible to measure very small sample volumes including thin films and heterostructures , something that until now as been largely limited to cuprate - based systems @xcite . </S>"
