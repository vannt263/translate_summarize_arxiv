    "during the past decade , significant progress has been made in understanding the physics of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and the connection between different subclasses of agn .",
    "in particular , various lines of evidence indicate that fr ii radio galaxies are the parent population of radio - loud quasars , with the relativistic jets of fsrqs being closely aligned to our line - of - sight ( for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "orientation effects are also thought to unify fr i radio galaxies with bl lac objects .",
    "the bl - lac / fr - i subclasses have lower average luminosities than the fsrq / fr - ii subclasses . among blazars , which include highly polarized and optically violently variable quasars , fsrqs and bl lac objects , there appears to be an almost continuous sequence of properties from fsrqs through lbls to hbls .",
    "this trend is characterized by decreasing bolometric luminosities , a shift of the peak frequencies of their broadband spectral components towards higher values , and a decreasing fraction of power in @xmath1 rays compared with lower - frequency radiation @xcite .    in the framework of relativistic jet models , the low - frequency ( radio  optical / uv ) emission from blazars",
    "is interpreted as synchrotron emission from nonthermal electrons in a relativistic jet . the high - frequency ( x - ray ",
    "@xmath1-ray ) emission is thought to be produced via compton upscattering of low frequency radiation by the same electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission .",
    "possible sources of soft seed photons for compton scattering are the synchrotron photons themselves @xcite or external photons , presumably dominated by the accretion disk emission which can enter the jet either directly @xcite or after reprocessing by circumnuclear gas and dust @xcite .",
    "in addition , a significant contribution to the soft radiation field may also be provided by infrared emission from dust in the vicinity of the agn @xcite .    the blazar sequence has been studied by @xcite using a large sample of blazar broadband spectra .",
    "they suggest that along the sequence hbl @xmath2 lbl @xmath2 fsrq , an increasing energy density of the external radiation field leads to an increasing amount of compton cooling . as a result , the maximum energy in the electron distribution decreases , causing the synchrotron and compton peaks to shift to lower frequencies .",
    "this explanation for the blazar sequence was developed further by @xcite , who argue that the radiating jet plasma is outside the broad - line scattering region in weak sources and within it in powerful sources .",
    "detailed model fits to the broadband spectra of several blazars also indicate that a decreasing contribution of the external radiation to the seed photon field reproduces the fsrq @xmath2 lbl @xmath2 hbl sequence .",
    "while fsrqs generally require a dominant external compton contribution to produce the observed @xmath1-ray emission ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hbls can be successfully fitted with pure synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) models ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the lbl bl  lacertae appears to be intermediate between those two classes , requiring a non - negligible contribution from external comptonization to reproduce its @xmath1-ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "orientation effects certainly play a role in spectral variations among sources within a given subclass , or even to account for the blue blazar subclass @xcite , but can not explain the full range of blazar properties @xcite .    it is uncertain whether the different blazar types are connected through an evolutionary sequence , or whether they constitute limited periods of agn activity on parallel evolutionary paths .",
    "an evolutionary sequence has recently been proposed by @xcite and @xcite who consider the efficiency of energy extraction from the accretion flow onto the central supermassive black hole through magnetic fields anchored in an optically thick accretion disk vs. energy extraction from rotational energy of the black hole via the blandford - znajek ( bz ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "they argue that bl lac objects can plausibly be powered by the bz mechanism without a significant contribution from an accretion disk , while fsrqs require a dominant contribution from the accretion disk to power the relativistic jets responsible for the production of the nonthermal broadband spectra .",
    "they suggest that a gradual depletion of the central environment in fsrqs by accretion onto the central black hole may be responsible for a transition from the disk - powered jet production ( in fsrqs ) to the bz - powered jet production mode ( in bl lac objects ) . furthermore , they find that a cosmological bl lac birth rate proportional to the rate of `` deaths '' of fsrqs ( through depletion of their central environments ) is consistent with the cosmological evolution observed for both quasars and bl lac objects .",
    "the masses of the central black holes in radio quasars generally exceed @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "similarly detailed mass determinations have so far not been possible for the lineless bl lacertae objects .",
    "the cluster environments of fr ii radio galaxies and radio quasars on the one hand , and fr i radio galaxies and bl lacs on the other hand appear consistent with an evolution of the former into the latter class of objects @xcite .",
    "also , the distribution of central black - hole masses in nearby non - active galaxies appears to extend to larger values than the distribution of radio - quasar black - hole masses @xcite , consistent with some fraction of present - day giant elliptical galaxies hosting the remnants of earlier quasar activity .",
    "here we expand on the suggestion of a cosmological evolutionary sequence @xcite from fsrqs to bl  lac objects by demonstrating that such a sequence plausibly and self - consistently explains the trend in their spectral properties .",
    "we employ a combined ssc / external compton model for relativistic jet emission , as described in ",
    "[ modelsetup ] , and derive parameter values from the observed multifrequency signatures of fsrqs and hbls .",
    "the evolutionary sequence connecting the respective parameter regimes is presented in  [ sequence ] .",
    "we discuss our results and suggest a possible evolutionary connection between radio - loud and radio - quiet agn classes in  [ discussion ] .",
    "the radiating plasma is modeled by a spherical emission region of co - moving radius @xmath4 that moves outward along the axis of the jet with bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 .",
    "electrons are injected into the plasma blob with a comoving power - law distribution @xmath6 , for electron lorentz factors in the range @xmath7 .",
    "the jet power @xmath8 corresponding to the energy input of injected particles into the jet is assumed to be proportional to the accretion disk power @xmath9 , as suggested by the observed proportionality between kinetic jet power and narrow line emission luminosity in radio - loud agn reported by @xcite and the proportionality between core radio luminosity and broad emission line luminosity in radio - loud agn found by @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite have found a similar proportionality between the 5  ghz radio luminosity and the [ o iii ] 5007 emission line luminosities both for radio - loud and radio - quiet agn .",
    "the jet power is related to the injected particle distribution through @xmath10 .",
    "electrons lose energy through adiabatic expansion , which is treated in terms of an escape time scale @xmath11 with @xmath12 , and through radiative losses .",
    "these losses are generally dominated by synchrotron and thomson processes , so they can be parameterized by the functional form @xmath13 , where @xmath14 .",
    "the terms @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 represent the comoving magnetic field , synchrotron , and external radiation field energy densities , respectively . if @xmath17 is dominated by reprocessed accretion - disk radiation due to circumnuclear gas and dust with a scattering optical depth @xmath18 at a characteristic distance @xmath19 from the central source , then @xmath20 .",
    "our approach is similar to the one used by @xcite , but differs from their model by our explicitly accounting for adiabatic losses and escape .",
    "these processes lead to the formation of a low - energy cutoff in the electron spectrum and force us to consider two distinct radiative regimes of electron cooling and of the equilibrium electron spectra ( see below ) , while the @xcite approach always leads to a @xmath21 electron spectrum for @xmath22 .",
    "we neglect pair processes , which generally turn out to be unimportant in the course of detailed spectral modeling of blazars .",
    "electrons injected with @xmath23 cool rapidly prior to escape , whereas electrons injected with @xmath24 lose only a small fraction of their energy before they escape .",
    "the competition between electron injection , cooling and escape establishes an equilibrium distribution given by @xmath25 two distinct radiative regimes can be defined .",
    "if @xmath26 , most of the injected electrons cool inefficiently and the electron population is in the slow cooling regime . in this case ,",
    "@xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the blob volume . when @xmath32 , the electron population is in the fast cooling regime , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "the synchrotron , and external - compton radiation emitted by these relativistic electron populations are evaluated using the formulae given by @xcite .",
    "the ssc radiation is calculated using the analytic solution of @xcite .    in the absence of an external compton component",
    ", we recover the ssc model used to fit data from hbls such as mrk  501 , mrk  421 , or pks  2155 - 304 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the parameters in an ssc model are the doppler factor @xmath37^{-1}$ ] , the magnetic field @xmath38 , @xmath4 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , the injection luminosity @xmath8 , and the injection spectral index @xmath41 . in principal ,",
    "the escape time scale parameter @xmath42 could also be considered a free parameter , though we assume ( see @xcite ) that @xmath43 , i.e. , @xmath44 .",
    "these studies find typical hbl parameters of @xmath45 ",
    "@xmath46  cm , @xmath47 , @xmath48  g , @xmath49  20  30 , and a rather broad range of injection luminosities @xmath50  ergs  s@xmath51 ",
    "@xmath52  erg  s@xmath51 , depending on the various model details and the individual flares that are modeled .",
    "the addition of the external compton component in fsrqs complicates parameter estimation .",
    "however , since detailed modeling of blazar spectra using self - consistent , combined ssc + erc spectral models is generally a rather time - consuming task , simple formulae to achieve order - of - magnitude estimates for the relevant model parameters are desirable in order to find a convenient starting point for more detailed modeling efforts . in the following ,",
    "we derive such estimates , although we must caution that some of the observables , in particular those pertaining to the ssc component , are rather uncertain , which may introduce significant scatter in the derived analytical parameter estimates .",
    "we assume that the x - ray spectra of fsrqs are dominated by the ssc process , as has been argued by various authors on the basis of spectral fitting as well as variability considerations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , while the @xmath1-ray spectrum is dominated by the external compton component .",
    "the peak photon energies and peak @xmath53 fluxes , @xmath54 ergs  @xmath55  s@xmath51 , of the compton and synchrotron components are determined from simultaneous multiwavelength observations . in the following ,",
    "photon energies are given in dimensionless units @xmath56 , and we define @xmath57 .",
    "the jets in blazars are generally believed to be oriented close to the line of sight where the doppler beaming factor @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for simplicity , we assume @xmath59 in the following .",
    "the model parameters can then be estimated from the observables through the expressions @xmath60",
    "@xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 the subscripts  sy , \"  ssc , \" and  erc \" refer to the synchrotron , ssc , and external compton components , respectively , and @xmath66 is the mean photon energy of the external soft photon field in the stationary frame of the agn .",
    "the factor @xmath67 in equations ( [ nfnsy ] )  ( [ nfnssc ] ) is a normalization factor defined through @xmath68 , and @xmath69 in equation ( [ nfnssc ] ) is a correction factor between the @xmath70 peak value and the total energy output in the ssc component , which differ significantly due to the substantial spectral broadness of the ssc emission .",
    "typically , @xmath71 . for the more strongly peaked synchrotron and erc components ,",
    "the corresponding correction factor is @xmath72 .    combining the above estimates , and defining @xmath73  cm and @xmath74  cm ,",
    "we find @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 note that equation ( [ fj ] ) requires an independent estimate of @xmath39 .",
    "assuming that the optical spectrum is produced through synchrotron emission from strongly cooled electrons , the injection spectral index @xmath41 can be estimated through the optical spectral index @xmath81 from the relation @xmath82 .    the requirement that @xmath83 yields a constraint on the external soft photon energy @xmath66 from equations ( [ resc ] ) and ( [ rb ] ) , given by @xmath84    however ,",
    "we point out that the observables @xmath85 and @xmath86 are generally uncertain by at least an order of magnitude since the ssc component does generally not show up as a pronounced bump in the broadband spectra of fsrqs .",
    "also the erc peak energy @xmath87 can rarely be determined to an accuracy of better than an order of magnitude .",
    "thus , great caution must be used when drawing conclusions from eq .",
    "( [ estar ] ) .",
    "for the example of 3c  279 , one of the best - observed egret - detected fsrqs , we can estimate typical values of the observables as @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for 3c 279 ,",
    "@xmath94 and @xmath95 , and we take @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 . equation ( [ estar ] ) then implies @xmath99 assuming @xmath100 ( corresponding to @xmath101  ev or @xmath102  hz ) .",
    "possible implications of this soft seed photon energy estimate will be discussed in  [ sequence ] .",
    "other model parameter estimates based on these observables are @xmath103 , @xmath104  g , @xmath105  cm , @xmath106  cm , @xmath107 , implying @xmath108  ergs  s@xmath51 .",
    "the high - energy cut - off of both the synchrotron and the compton components are poorly known in 3c  279 and other fsrqs , so no reliable constraint on the maximum electron energy @xmath40 can be derived in the fsrq case .",
    "the parameter estimates for the fsrq case quoted above are in good agreement with those found by @xcite for fsrqs in general , and through more detailed spectral modeling of 3c  279 in particular ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which indicates that our analytic estimates may indeed be useful to assess a convenient starting point for more detailed spectral modeling of fsrqs .",
    "in the previous section , we obtained typical parameter values for hbls and fsrqs .",
    "these estimates indicate that the most significant differences between model parameters of fsrqs and hbls are found in the values of the jet power @xmath8 and the magnetic field @xmath38 , which are both found to decrease by more than an order of magnitude from fsrqs to hbls .",
    "the lack of evidence for a significant contribution of an external compton component to the @xmath1-ray spectra of hbls indicates that the energy density of the external soft photon field  parameterized through @xmath9 , @xmath18 , and @xmath109  decreases by @xmath110 orders of magnitude along the sequence of blazar types .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "the decreasing energy density of the external soft photon field along the sequence fsrq @xmath2 lbl @xmath2 hbl , in tandem with the decreasing jet power suggests that this is a consequence of a decreasing accretion rate along this sequence .",
    "this , in turn , is in very good agreement with the suggestion of @xcite and @xcite of an evolutionary sequence from fsrqs to bl lacs characterized by such a decline in the accretion rate .",
    "we are thus motivated to try to reconstruct the evolutionary sequence fsrq @xmath2 lbl @xmath2 hbl by varying the accretion rate ( and other model parameters dependent on the accretion rate ) in our specific spectral blazar model described in the previous section . in order to do so",
    ", we are starting out with parameters appropriate to reproduce the broadband spectrum of a typical fsrq .",
    "the fsrq phase constitutes an early phase of blazar evolution in which the central regions of the galaxy are rich in gas and dust , leading to a high accretion rate onto the central , supermassive black hole . at the same time , the circumnuclear material efficiently reprocesses and scatters the accretion - disk radiation , leading to the observed strong optical emission lines in the broad line region and to a high energy density of the external soft photon field in the jet .    due to the limited supply of matter in the nuclear region ,",
    "the average density of the circumnuclear material will gradually decrease , leading to a decreasing accretion rate and a decreasing reprocessing efficiency .",
    "we parametrize this evolutionary transition by a gradual decline of the accretion rate and assume that the reprocessing efficiency @xmath18 is proportional to the accretion rate .",
    "this should be a reasonable approximation for the long - term evolution on cosmological time scales , although the actual blr density and the instantaneous accretion rate may be less strictly correlated on shorter time scales .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the fraction of accreted energy channeled into the relativistic outflow , @xmath111 , remains constant , as suggested by the observed @xmath8 vs. @xmath112 and @xmath8 vs. @xmath113 correlations @xcite , and that the transverse extent of the jet , @xmath4 , does not change dramatically during this evolution .",
    "the magnetic field is chosen to be a constant fraction of the equipartition magnetic field so that @xmath114 , which automatically leads to the required reduction of the magnetic field along the evolutionary sequence .",
    "the resulting sequence of broadband spectra , shown in fig .   [ fig_sequence ] , provides a quantitative explanation for the observed trend of luminosities and peak photon energies in the fsrq @xmath2 lbl @xmath2 hbl sequence @xcite .",
    "it does not account for the spectral properties of specific blazars , which depend on variations of parameter values in different sources and , importantly , the angle between the direction of the jet axis and the direction to the observer .",
    "we note that the apparent minimum at @xmath115  hz in the fsrq spectrum ( corresponding to the @xmath96 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig_sequence ] ) might be filled in by an additional contribution from compton - scattered accretion disk radiation that enters the jet directly , which has been neglected in our semi - analytic model .    our estimate ( eq .  [",
    "[ estar ] ] ) for the average energy @xmath116 of the dominant external soft photon field has interesting implications .",
    "although one has to keep in mind that the analytical estimate for @xmath66 may be rather uncertain due to the uncertainty in the observables pertaining to the ssc component , we found that significantly higher values of @xmath66 did not allow an acceptable representation of a typical fsrq spectrum with our model .",
    "this probably indicates that the external soft photon field is dominated by optical line emission from the partially ionized broad - line regions .",
    "the external photon field peaking at @xmath66 is unlikely to be due to thomson scattering off free electrons in a highly ionized circumnuclear environment , since in that case @xmath66 should reflect the peak energy of the optically thick accretion disk , which would be inconsistent with the evidence for thermal excess emission , peaking at @xmath117  hz , observed in the low @xmath1-ray state of 3c  279 by @xcite and with the peak frequency of @xmath118  hz of the big blue bump seen in 3c  273 @xcite which is generally attributed to the emission from the optically thick accretion disk .",
    "the proposed evolutionary scenario provides a simple physical connection between different blazar subclasses in terms of the depletion of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes . after an early phase of rapid black - hole growth , the time scale for this depletion",
    "is given by the matter free - fall time @xmath119 at the bondi - hoyle accretion radius , where @xmath120 is the mass of the central black hole in units of @xmath121 and @xmath122  k is the average temperature of the circumnuclear material .",
    "this is generally shorter than the hubble time , and gives a plausible time scale to explain a finite duration of blazar - like activity in the nuclei of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the scenario proposed here is also in accord with the x - ray faintness of giant elliptical galaxies known to contain supermassive black holes , which may be remnants of past blazar activity .",
    "the central sources in these galaxies have been successfully modeled with advection - dominated accretion flow solutions at very low accretion rates , @xmath123 @xcite , suggesting a central region depleted after an earlier period of more efficient accretion .",
    "if this picture is correct , then there should also be objects in an earlier phase of rapid black - hole growth that are accreting at rates @xmath124 .",
    "following the scenario outlined by @xcite , this earlier stage of blazar evolution would comprise merging galaxies , infrared luminous galaxies , and radio - quiet qsos .",
    "accretion flows near the eddington limit might produce optically - thick accretion disks extending all the way to the innermost stable orbit .",
    "if the phenomenology of galactic black - hole candidates can be scaled to supermassive black holes accreting at comparable values of @xmath125 , then radio jet formation should be quenched in such a mode of accretion as is observed , e.g. , in grs  1915 + 105 @xcite , gx  339 - 4 @xcite , and xte j1550 - 564 @xcite .",
    "this idea is supported by recent theoretical work that links the existence and energetics of a central advection - dominated inflow - outflow system to the formation of relativistic jets @xcite .",
    "the asca detections of relativistically broadened fe k@xmath126 emission in mcg-6 - 30 - 15 @xcite and iras  18325 - 5926 @xcite and the rapid x - ray variability seen in iras  13224 - 3809 and phl  1092 @xcite , suggest that at least in a number of cases an optically thick accretion disk does extend towards the innermost stable orbit . in most cases",
    "the evidence is yet inconclusive , but a similar mode of accretion can generally not be ruled out .",
    "the formation of radio jets in blazars and radio galaxies , if related to the formation of an advection - dominated accretion mode in the inner portions of the accretion flow , is triggered by a decreasing eddington ratio .",
    "the decline of @xmath125 might be due to a combination of a decreasing accretion rate and an increasing black - hole mass .",
    "an implication of this scenario is that the masses of the central black holes in galaxies which host bl lacs should , on average , be greater than the masses of black holes in galaxies which host fsrqs or optical qsos .",
    "moreover , subclasses at earlier stages in the blazar sequence should exhibit increasingly stronger cosmological evolution .",
    "@xcite find evidence for negative cosmological evolution of x - ray selected bl lac objects , and @xcite find evidence for positive cosmological evolution in a radio - selected bl lac sample , in accord with this picture .",
    "our work provides strong support for the suggestion by @xcite and @xcite along parallel lines , but on the basis of general energy considerations and a generic cosmological evolution scenario for quasars evolving into bl lac objects .",
    "we have combined the basic idea of such a cosmological evolution with a self - consistent spectral blazar model and demonstrated that the spectral properties of the different blazar subclasses can be consistently explained by such an evolutionary sequence .",
    "the blazar model adopted here is similar to the one previously used by @xcite  but with the important addition of particle escape and adiabatic losses  who had argued that the different blazar subclasses could be unified by an increasing level of external radiation to the soft radiation field in the emitting region .    to summarize",
    ", we have proposed an evolutionary scenario linking fsrqs , lbls , and hbls through gradual depletion of the circumnuclear environment of a supermassive black hole .",
    "as the accretion power declines with time , less gas and dust is available to reprocess accretion - disk radiation and produce an external compton - scattered component in the blazar jet .",
    "analytic formulae are given to estimate the relevant model parameters for fsrqs .",
    "we have calculated a spectral sequence for different blazar subclasses that are related through a one - parameter model defined by the optical depth of the circumnuclear matter . this scenario links radio - loud agns with progenitor merger galaxies and qsos that constitute the high eddington - ratio limit of the evolutionary sequence . in analogy with the observed anti - correlation between radio and soft x - ray activity in some galactic black - hole candidates , these progenitor sources would accrete with large eddington ratios , resulting in an optically - thick accretion disk that quenches relativistic jet production .",
