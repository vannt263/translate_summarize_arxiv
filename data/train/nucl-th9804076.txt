    "the basic points of the semimicroscopical approach are the following : ( i ) continuum - rpa ( crpa ) calculation of the reaction amplitudes corresponding to the excitation of the considered gr by an external single - particle field ; ( ii ) breit - wigner parameterization of the calculated amplitudes to deduce the parameters of those particle - hole - type doorway states , which form the gr ; ( iii ) a phenomenological description ( with averaging over the energy ) of the doorway - state coupling to many - quasiparticle configurations . in the considered case the only adjustable parameter needed for the description is found by comparison of the calculated and experimental total widths of the @xmath1 .",
