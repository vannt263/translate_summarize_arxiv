    "the aim of this paper is to prove that when the single site measure without interactions ( consisting only of the phase ) @xmath3 satisfies the log - sobolev inequality , then the gibbs measure of the associated local specification @xmath4 , with hamiltonian @xmath5 also satisfies a log - sobolev inequality , when the interactions @xmath6 are quadratic .",
    "since the main condition about the phase measure does not involve the local specification @xmath7 nor the one site measure @xmath8 , we present a criterion for the infinite dimensional gibbs measure inequality without assuming or proving the usual dobrushin and shlosman s mixing conditions for the local specification as in @xcite and more recently in @xcite . as a matter of fact , in order to control the boundary conditions involved in the interactions",
    ", we will make use of the u - bound inequalities introduced in @xcite to prove coercive inequalities in a standard non statistical mechanics framework . as a result",
    "we prove the inequality for a variety of phases extending beyond the usual euclidean case , as well as involving measures with phase like @xmath9 that go beyond the typical convexity at infinity .    for the investigation of criteria for the logarithmic sobolev inequality for the infinite dimensional gibbs measure of the local specification @xmath4",
    "two main approaches have been developed .",
    "the first approach is based in proving first that the measures @xmath4 satisfy a log - sobolev inequality with a constant uniformly on the set @xmath10 and the boundary conditions @xmath11 .",
    "then the inequality for the gibbs measure follows directly from the uniform inequality for the local specification .",
    "criteria for the local specification to satisfy a log - sobolev inequality uniformly on the set @xmath10 and the boundary conditions have been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "similar results for the weaker spectral gap inequality have been obtained by @xcite .",
    "the second approach focuses in obtaining the inequality for the gibbs measure directly , without showing first the stronger uniform inequality for the local specification .",
    "such criteria on the local specification in the case of quadratic interactions for the infinite - dimensional gibbs measure on the lattice have been investigated by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the problem of passing from the single site to infinite dimensional measure , in the case of quadratic interactions , is addressed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "what it has been shown is that when the one site measure @xmath8 satisfies a log - sobolev inequality uniformly on the boundary conditions , then in the presence of quadratic interactions the infinite gibbs measure also satisfies a log - sobolev inequality .    for the single - site measure @xmath8 ,",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the log - sobolev inequality to be satisfied uniformly over the boundary conditions @xmath11 , are also presented in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the scope of the current paper is to prove the log - sobolev inequality for the gibbs measure without setting conditions neither on the local specification @xmath7 nor on the one site measure @xmath8 .",
    "what we actually show is that in the presence of quadratic interactions , the gibbs measure always satisfies a log - sobolev inequality whenever the boundary free one site measure @xmath12 satisfies a log - sobolev inequality . in that way",
    "we improve the previous results since the log - sobolev inequality is determined alone by the phase @xmath13 of the simple without interactions measure @xmath14 on @xmath15 , for which a plethora of criteria and examples of good measure that satisfy the inequality exist .",

    "is then defined as @xmath92 the aim of this paper is to show that the infinite volume gibbs measure @xmath77 satisfies the log - sobolev inequality ( [ lsg ] ) for an appropriate constant . as explained in the introduction , in the case of quadratic interactions , previous works concentrated in proving first the stronger ( [ lse ] ) for all @xmath22 , or assumed the log - sobolev inequality ( [ lse ] ) for the one site @xmath93 and then derived from these ( [ lsg ] ) .",
    "our aim is to show that if we assume the weaker inequality ( [ ls ] ) for the phase measure @xmath94 , then in the presence of quadratic interaction this is sufficient to obtain directly the log - sobolev inequality for the gibbs measure ( [ lsg ] ) , without the need to assume or prove any of the stronger inequalities ( [ lse ] ) that require uniformity on the boundary conditions and/or the dimension of the measure .",
