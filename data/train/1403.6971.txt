    "a number of authors have investigated when one has lil - type results for random vectors @xmath12 with @xmath44 .",

    "furthermore , it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath56 and the variables @xmath57 are independent , then the cluster sets are from the subclass of sets which are the closures of at most countable unions of standard ellipsoids . moreover all sets of this type also occur as cluster sets in this case . here",

    "another way to say this is that a standard ellipsoid is a set of the form @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix .",
