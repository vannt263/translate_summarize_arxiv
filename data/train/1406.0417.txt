    "general relativity ( gr ) is a very successful theory and is the best contender , so far to describe the geometrical properties of the spacetime .",
    "it has passed through all the experimental and observational tests so far , ranging from local gravity tests like perihelion precession and bending of light to precision tests using pulsars @xcite . in spite of these outstanding success for gr",
    "there are still unresolved issues .",
    "these include : the problem of dark energy and the problem of inflation .",
    "phrased in a different way , the reason for accelerated expansion of the universe at both very small scale and very large scale is unknown @xcite .",
    "these issues are generally dealt with by assuming existence of additional matter component in the universe , like cosmological constant , fluid with complicated equation of state , scalar fields etc .",
    "however all these models are plagued with several issues , e.g. , coupling with usual matter , consistency with elementary particle theories and consistency of formulation @xcite .",
    "these results prompted research in a new direction by modifying the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action for gr itself .",
    "this idea of modifying the eh action stem from the belief that gr is just a low energy approximation of some underlying fundamental theory @xcite . in this spirit",
    "the classical generalizations of eh action should explain both early - time inflation and late - time cosmic acceleration without ever introducing additional matter components in the energy momentum tensor .",
    "there exist large number of ways in which the standard eh action can be modified by introducing non - linear terms .",
    "however the criteria that the field equations should remain second order in the dynamical variable ( otherwise some ghost fields would appear ) uniquely fixes the action to be the lanczos - lovelock action @xcite .",
    "the lanczos - lovelock lagrangian has this special property that though the lagrangian contains higher curvature terms the field equation turns out to be of second order @xcite .",
    "one of the important model is the second order correction term in the gravity action in addition to eh term , called gauss - bonnet ( gb ) lagrangian .",
    "another such model explaining the above mentioned problems is obtained by replacing @xmath1 , the scalar curvature in the eh action by some arbitrary function of the scalar curvature @xmath0 . this alternative theory for describing gravitational interaction is very interesting in its on right , for it can provide an explanation to a large number of experimental phenomenon .",
    "these include : late time cosmic acceleration @xcite , early power law inflation @xcite , problem of singularity in strong gravity regime @xcite along with possible detection of gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "compatibility with newtonian and post - newtonian approximations as well as estimations of cosmological parameters are shown in @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 theories can also bypass a long known instability problem , called ` ostrogradski ' instability @xcite and is capable of explaining recent graviton mass bound in lhc , with possible constraints on the model itself @xcite .",
    "there also exist quiet a few gravity models , which comes into existence from some low energy string inspired theories .",
    "for example the gb lagrangian discussed earlier is actually a low energy realization of a string inspired model @xcite . in this context",
    ", we should mention that there exist a natural generalization of the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution in gr to that in string inspired models with dilaton coupling .",
    "the dilaton field couples with the electromagnetic field tensor @xmath2 in such a fashion that every solution with non - zero @xmath2 couples with the dilaton field @xcite .    in this work",
    "our main aim is to obtain the equilibrium configuration of perfect fluid rotating around black holes in these alternative gravity theories .",
    "this in turn will allow us to address the new features that come out in comparison to their general relativistic counterpart .",
    "for this purpose we have first studied the equilibrium configuration of fluid in a general static spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "having derived various quantities of interest in this general context , we apply them to the black hole solutions in various alternative gravity theories .",
    "this can be achieved by substituting the metric elements describing spherically symmetric spacetime in these alternative theories into our general result . throughout this work",
    "we have mainly concentrated on three alternative theories , the @xmath0 gravity theory , dilaton induced gravity theory and finally the einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet ( emgb ) gravity .",
    "after deriving the results for a general static spherically symmetric spacetime , as a warm up we have applied our results to the rn solution in einstein gravity .",
    "then we have applied these results to a charged black hole solution in @xmath0 gravity theory .",
    "it turns out that the equipotential contours of the perfect fluid rotating around black hole in this gravity model are quiet different from its gr counterpart .",
    "identical features are shared by the equilibrium configuration of perfect fluid rotating around black hole in the emgb theory as well .",
    "however the equipotential contours of perfect fluid rotating around black holes in dilaton gravity are different from the previous two situations .",
    "still the equipotential contours exhibit features distinct in comparison to the respective gr solution .",
    "all these results suggest that the equilibrium configurations of perfect fluid rotating around black holes in alternative gravity theories have structures different from gr . by comparing these alternative theories under one roof ,",
    "as presented in this work , we have been able to understand the structure of accretion disks and in - fall of matter to them in some detail .",
    "this might help to understand the accretion disk structure around other black hole solutions by direct comparison with results presented in this work .",
    "since the accretion disk is intimately connected with various astrophysical processes , it is natural to ask for some observational consequences of our result .",
    "we should stress at this point that though the accretion disk structure gets modified with outflow and inflow of matter associated due to introduction of alternative theories it is unlikely to be observed in an observational test .",
    "these results have to do with the fact that the accretion disk structure across a black hole in these alternative theories are determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath3 in geometrized units , where @xmath4 is the cosmological constant and @xmath5 being the black hole mass . in order to have stable circular orbits necessary for existence of accretion disc ,",
    "the cosmological parameter has a restriction @xmath6 as we have shown later .",
    "along with we can use cosmological tests using magnitude - redshift relation for supernova with the measurements of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuation @xcite implying @xmath7 .",
    "this leads to very low values of @xmath8 for realistic black holes .",
    "for example , in case of an extremely massive black hole as seen in quasar ton 618 , with mass @xmath9 @xcite leads to @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that the parameter space for observations in astrophysical scenarios has the value of cosmological parameter @xmath11 .",
    "this is quiet small compared to the value @xmath12 presented in the text for being of astrophysical importance @xcite .",
    "thus for normal astrophysical systems it is difficult to detect any departure from the result predicted by gr . even for quiet massive systems departure from gr , with observed",
    "accuracy has not been found to date .",
    "such small values are out of the parameter space for present day astrophysical observations , making the test for these alternative theories difficult .",
    "however there is another window to look for signatures of these alternative theories . for primordial black holes in the early universe",
    "the _ effective _ cosmological constant was higher @xcite and consequently @xmath8 would had a much larger value of comparable to @xmath13 .",
    "thus in the early universe the accretion disk structure around primordial black holes may posses the features discussed in this work .",
    "but this is also far from being observed experimentally .",
    "in spite of these difficulties in relating to observational results , the work stands on its own , for it describes the accretion structure in alternative theories and its departure from the gr results .",
    "for some choice of the parameter space the structure in alternative theories are much rich and differ significantly from that in gr .",
    "this analysis brings out the fact that introduction of higher curvature terms in the eh action alters the accretion disk structure of perfect fluid orbiting the black hole in a non - trivial manner with more structures included .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ eqfluid ] we have illustrated the boyer s condition @xcite in order to have an equilibrium configuration of the perfect fluid .",
    "then in the next section [ equigen ] we have derived various physical quantities for a general static spherically symmetric spacetime , which we have subsequently applied to determine equipotential surfaces of fluid moving around various black hole solutions in different gravity theories . among these alternative theories",
    "we have discussed the rn solution , topologically charged black hole in @xmath0 theory , charged black hole in dilaton gravity and finally black hole in emgb theory in [ equialt ] . at the end",
    "we conclude with a discussion on our results .",
    "in this section we briefly summarize the well known results regarding general theory of equipotential surfaces inside any relativistic , differentially rotating , perfect fluid body @xcite .",
    "this has also been applied to configurations of perfect fluid rotating in the stationary and axi - symmetric spacetimes @xcite . in standard",
    "coordinate system the spacetime is described by the following line element , @xmath14 where the metric elements depend neither on time coordinate @xmath15 nor on azimuthal coordinate @xmath16 . hence energy and angular momenta",
    "are two conserved quantities in this spacetime implying existence of two killing vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18",
    ". we shall consider perfect fluid rotating in the @xmath16 direction .",
    "then its four velocity field @xmath19 has only two non - zero components , @xmath20 which can be functions of the coordinates @xmath21 .",
    "the stress energy tensor of the perfect fluid is , @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the total energy density and the pressure of the fluid .",
    "the rotating fluid can be characterized by the vector fields of the angular velocity @xmath25 , and the angular momentum per unit mass ( angular momentum density ) @xmath26 , defined by @xmath27 these vector fields are related to the metric elements by the following result @xmath28 in static spacetimes ( @xmath29 ) , the above relation reduces to the simple formula @xmath30 the surfaces of constant @xmath26 and @xmath25 are called von zeipel s cylinders .",
    "these surfaces do not depend on the rotation law for fluids in static spacetimes but do depend on the rotation law for stationary spacetimes @xcite .",
    "projecting the stress energy tensor conservation law @xmath31 onto the hypersurface orthogonal to the four velocity @xmath19 by the projective tensor @xmath32 , we obtain the relativistic euler equation in the form , @xmath33 where @xmath34 the solution to the relativistic euler equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) can be obtained by defining the potential @xmath35 whose  equipotential surfaces \" are surfaces of constant pressure through the following relation @xcite : @xmath36 which leads to @xmath37 the subscript  in \" in the above equations refer to the inner edge of the disk .",
    "for an alternative definition and thus derivation of boyer s conditions see ref .",
    "the equipotential surfaces are determined by the condition , @xmath38 and in a given spacetime @xmath39 can be found from eq .",

    "the surfaces of constant pressure are being determined by eq .",
    "( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the structure of thick accretion disks can also be found using the accurate newtonian framework called pseudo - newtonian potential method @xcite .",
    "in this section we shall start with a general metric ansatz .",
    "this is very appropriate for describing various static spherically symmetric solutions in both einstein gravity or other alternative gravity theories @xcite .",
    "the metric ansatz is simple enough that it can be easily generalized to arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions .",
    "the general metric ansatz is taken as , @xmath43 note that the characteristic property of equipotential surfaces is retained in this simplest choice , which is uniform distribution of angular momentum density @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "the importance of the above statement enhances considerably from the fact that marginally stable configurations comes into existence under the condition @xcite @xmath44 this holds for any rotating fluid irrespective of its rotation law for static spacetime ( however for stationary spacetime the above condition depends on the rotation law @xcite ) . using which we can obtain the following expression for equipotential surfaces from eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) as @xmath45 note that the quantity @xmath46 depends only on the metric and is being completely determined by eq .",
    "( [ geneq1a ] ) .",

    "the potential should be real and that eventually leads to the following conditions @xmath56 the first condition would lead to static regions outside the black hole horizon where the perfect fluid orbiting the black hole can have equilibrium configurations .",
    "the second condition can be expressed in an elegant form as : @xmath57 where the function defined as @xmath58 is the effective potential of photon geodesic , with impact parameter @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "note that the extremization of the potential @xmath60 being identical with the condition that pressure gradient should vanish i.e. @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "however since we are concerned with the equatorial plane ( @xmath55 ) , the criteria @xmath63 is sufficient for maximization of @xmath64 leading to @xmath65^{3/2}}\\ ] ] it is well known that the extrema of the potential on the equatorial plane @xmath64 corresponds to motion along circular geodesics .",
    "thus the angular momentum distribution @xmath66 obtained from the condition @xmath67 represents the angular momentum density for circular orbits . from eq .",
    "( [ geneq3c ] ) the following estimation of angular momentum density @xmath68 becomes possible @xmath69 with this identification of @xmath68 , the extrema for the potential @xmath64 can be obtained as @xmath70 which determines @xmath71 to be the specific energy attributed for motion along circular geodesics .",
    "thus in order to summarize our results , we have discussed that one of the most important properties of the potential @xmath35 is that its behaviour at equatorial plane @xmath55 completely determines all the parameters under interest through @xmath58 and @xmath68 . from these two angular momentum densities",
    "we will be able to introduce more parameters in order to explain the behaviour of the fluid configuration in an compact and understandable fashion",

    "we will henceforth use these results frequently throughout the later part of this work .",
    "in this section we will apply the results derived in the previous section to spherically symmetric and static spacetimes in both gr and alternative gravity theories .",
    "we will start with the reissner - nordstrm solution in general relativity and then subsequently will generalize to alternative gravity theories . among these alternative theories , we will consider the black hole solution in @xmath0 gravity first , then einstein - maxwell gravity with dilaton field , finally specializing to einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet gravity ( similar aspects within gr framework has been considered in @xcite ) .      before proceeding to alternative theories",

    "( [ geneq4 ] ) with the following expression @xmath88 then we also have the following expression for derivative of @xmath68 : @xmath89 the minima of the photon angular momentum can be obtained by plugging in eq .",

    "the charge term in the above expression goes as @xmath101 in @xmath102 dimension , while it goes as @xmath103 in standard charged higher dimensional black hole spacetime .",
    "therefore it is interesting to ask whether this term is originating from the scalar - tensor representation of @xmath0 gravity . in order to obtain the representation the standard way is to start with conformal transformations on the metric elements .",
    "however in this case no new physical interpretation can be obtained except its relation to the scale of the problem @xcite .",
    "the above result can also be interpreted in a slightly different manner , uncharged solutions in @xmath104 theory shows exact similarity with einstein gravity in presence of a cosmological constant .",
    "thus in those situations @xmath105 plays the role of cosmological constant .",
    "as shown in @xcite this charged solution is equivalent to einstein gravity coupled with conformally invariant maxwell field , such that @xmath105 term in this situation has the role of electromagnetic field .",
    "this acts as a origin of the charge term .",
    "next we will consider the equilibrium configurations of perfect fluid rotating around this black hole . for notational simplicity we will assume , @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",

    "there is only two physically meaningful interval . 1 .",
    "this situation has equipotential surfaces identical to the situation illustrated in ( 1a ) .",
    "@xmath164 this is similar to the situation ( 2a ) discussed earlier .",
    "we should also mention in this connection that the following numerical values are obtained for angular momentum densities , which are important for the study of fluid orbiting around black hole .",
    "the angular momentum density for inner marginally stable orbit is @xmath165 , while that for outer marginally stable orbit is given by , @xmath166 for cosmological parameter being @xmath167 .",
    "two other important angular momentum densities are that of marginally bound orbit with , @xmath168 and for photon circular orbit as , @xmath169 .",
    "these expressions are of quiet importance to study the structure of accretion disk .",
    "equilibrium configurations originating from test particle fluid , which is rotating in a given spacetime are determined by the equipotential surfaces , where the gravitational and inertial forces are being compensated by the pressure gradient .",
    "( for an axially symmetric spacetime the rotation axis of the equilibrium configuration coincides with the axis of symmetry for the spacetime , while for a spherically symmetric case this axis can be any radial line ; see for example @xcite ) .    the influence of a non - zero dilaton charge coming from an effective string theory on the character of the equipotential surfaces of marginally stable orbits have been studied , for configuration rotating around such black holes .",
    "static uncharged black hole in general relativity is described by well known and well studied schwarzschild solution .",
    "however even for large mass black hole ( compared to planck mass ) the schwarzschild solution is a good approximation to describe uncharged black hole in string theory except for regions near the singularity .",
    "this situation is completely different for the einstein - maxwell solution in string inspired theory due to dilaton coupling .    the dilaton couples with @xmath170 with implication that every solution having non zero @xmath2 couples with dilaton .",
    "thus the charged black hole solution in general relativity ( the reissner - nordstrm solution ) appears in string theory with presence of dilaton .",
    "thus the effective four dimensional low energy action is given by , @xmath171\\ ] ] where @xmath172 is the maxwell field and we have set other gauge and antisymmetric tensor field , e.g. the kalb - ramond field @xmath173 to zero in order to focus on dilaton field @xmath174 @xcite .",
    "extremizing the above action with respect to the @xmath175 potential @xmath176 , dilaton field @xmath174 and metric @xmath177 lead to the following field equations , @xmath178 the static spherically symmetric solution to the above field equations yield the line element as @xcite : @xmath179 where , @xmath180 .",
    "due to isometry we can confine our motion in the equatorial plane such that , @xmath181 [ i.e. @xmath114 ] . here",
    "@xmath183 gives the asymptotic value of dilaton field and @xmath78 represents the black hole charge .",
    "this solution is almost identical to the schwarzschild metric with the difference being that areas of two spheres depend on q. the surface @xmath184 is singular and @xmath185 is the regular event horizon .",
    "the solution of the scalar field @xmath174 as a function of @xmath54 in terms of its asymptotic value @xmath186 can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq15a ] ) leading to the following result @xcite : @xmath187 from the above result note that we have the following limit , @xmath188 leading to @xmath189 .",
    "thus the dilaton charge can be defined as , @xmath190 where the integral is over the two sphere located at spatial infinity and @xmath191 is the normal to the corresponding two sphere at spatial infinity . for the charged black hole we are considering this leads to , @xmath192 note that dilaton charge d depends on the asymptotic value of dilaton field @xmath186 , which is determined solely by m and q and is always negative .",
    "one point must be mentioned while passing , that this charge originates from coupling of electromagnetic field with a scalar field , the actual charge present in the system is the electromagnetic charge q. if there were no electromagnetic charge the dilaton charge d defined through eq .",
    "( [ eq18 ] ) would have been zero .",
    "hence this dilaton charge is not a scalar charge it s a coupling between the electromagnetic charge and the scalar field at asymptotic infinity .",
    "this charge is also responsible for long range attractive force between black holes @xcite .",
    "note that the actual dependence on dilaton field depends on planck scale described by , @xmath193 . since we have worked in the unit",
    "@xmath194 the term modified to @xmath195 . as @xmath196 ,",
    "this term become significant .",
    "for notational convenience we shall define a quantity @xmath197 and by virtue of above discussion @xmath198 is always positive .",
    "hence our solution is parameterized by the variable @xmath198 and choosing the dimensionless expression such that @xmath199 we get the line element as @xmath200 then we have two horizons in our system given by @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "we shall took the choice in which @xmath203 or equivalently @xmath204 .",
    "\\(a )   ( b )   +    thus equilibrium configurations are possible only for @xmath205 .",
    "now the equipotential surfaces are possible only in these spacetimes .",
    "now , the equipotential surfaces are determined by the result , @xmath206}{\\left[r^{2}(r-2q)\\sin^{2}\\theta-(r-2)\\ell ^{2}\\right]}\\ ] ] and @xmath207 for @xmath208 the above results reduces to the well known schwarzschild result @xcite .",
    "the best insight into the nature of the @xmath49 fluid configurations are obtained by examining the behavior of @xmath35 in the equatorial plane ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "there are two reality conditions on @xmath60 : @xmath209 and @xmath210 the first condition is just the statement that the fluid should remain outside the black hole horizons and we shall calculate it s property in that non singular region of spacetime .",
    "while the second condition implies , @xmath211 this function @xmath212 can be thought of as an effective potential of the photon geodesic motion , also note that @xmath213 has a close correspondence with the impact parameter for photon geodesic motion @xcite .",
    "further the condition to obtain local extrema of the potential @xmath60 is identical to the condition for vanishing of pressure gradient ( @xmath214 ) . since at the equatorial plane",
    "we have @xmath62 independently along with the criteria @xmath49 , and the following relation : @xmath215^{3/2}\\left[r(r-2)(r-2q)\\right]^{1/2}}\\ ] ]    ( a1 )   ( a2 )   + ( b1 )   ( b2 )   + ( c1 )   ( c2 )   + ( d1 )   ( d2 )   +    from which we arrive at the particular expression for angular momentum density , @xmath216 the extrema for @xmath60 correspond to the spacetime points , where fluid moves along a circular geodesics , since @xmath217 relates to the distribution of the angular momentum density of circular geodesic orbits .",
    "clearly this leads to , @xmath218 where @xmath219 is defined as the specific energy along these circular geodesics .",
    "important properties of the potential @xmath35 are determined by its behavior at the equatorial plane , and , specially by the properties of the functions @xmath212 and @xmath220 .",
    "discussion of these properties enable us to classify the dilaton gravity spacetime according to the properties of equipotential surfaces of test particle fluid . for pure schwarzschild spacetime ( @xmath208 )",
    "the analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    from the analytical form of @xmath221",
    "it is evident that the quantity diverges at the black hole horizon ( @xmath222 ) .",
    "however it shows no such divergence for the inner horizon given by @xmath223 .",
    "the local minimum of the function @xmath221 corresponds to the radius of photon circular orbit and has the following expression , @xmath224 with the impact parameter , @xmath225 the function @xmath226 , determining the keplerian ( geodesic ) circular orbits , has a zero point at the so called static radius given by , @xmath227 which coincides with the inner horizon , also note that the function has divergent nature at @xmath222 and as well as at @xmath228 .",
    "the function @xmath217 diverges at the black hole horizon i.e. @xmath229 . since , @xmath230 the local extrema of @xmath226",
    "are given by the condition , @xmath231 determining the marginally stable circular orbits .",
    "for @xmath232 , there exists an inner ( outer ) marginally stable circular geodesic at @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "other special values of @xmath198 corresponds to the situation where the value of the minimum of @xmath221 equals the maximum of @xmath226 .",
    "we denote this value by @xmath233 and is a solution of the algebraic equation , @xmath234 however this situation is less important as the above equation has no physical solution .",
    "thus we will not have any inner cusp present in the system .",
    "hence this has less attractive features , still interesting which we will present now .",
    "in this situation the behavior of @xmath58 and @xmath66 are similar to that of rn scenario . while we have only four available situations . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we have a minimum for @xmath68 having value , @xmath235 .",
    "we also have a minimum in @xmath58 which corresponds to the value , @xmath236 .",
    "thus all together we have four cases in this dilaton gravity model from behavior of the potential @xmath237 .",
    "these cases are given for following intervals of @xmath26 :    1 .",
    "we have only open equipotential surfaces in this angular momentum range [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6]a1 - 2 ] .",
    "2 .   @xmath239 .",
    "an infinitesimally thin and unstable rings comes to existence at the marginally stable radius [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6]b1 - 2 ] .",
    "3 .   @xmath240",
    ". closed equipotential surfaces comes into existence , with one such surface having cusp , allowing inflow to the black hole [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6]c1 - 2 ] 4 .",
    ". closed equipotential surfaces exist , however cusps does not exist .",
    "thus in the near horizon region equipotential surfaces can not cross equatorial plane [ see fig .",
    "[ fig6]d1 - 2 ] .",
    "thus we have obtained structure of equipotential surfaces in dilaton gravity . how the inflow occur in this spacetime along with necessary criteria on the angular momentum density . also behavior in determining the angular momentum density which admits no minima .",
    "hence this can be thought of having less structure than the previous one still having quiet interesting features .      in high energy physics ,",
    "assuming spacetime to have more than four dimensions is a common practice . in these scenarios ,",
    "the spacetime is assumed to be a four dimensional brane , embedded on a higher dimensional bulk .",
    "though ordinary matter fields are confined to these branes , gravity can interact via bulk as well .",
    "the eh action needs to be modified as well and the most natural choice would be to include higher order terms in the action .",
    "a famous second order term is called the gauss bonnet term , under whose presence the modified action looks like , @xmath242\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 , @xmath94 and @xmath243 are ricci scalar , ricci tensor and riemann tensor respectively .",
    "@xmath244 is the electromagnetic tensor field and @xmath245 being the gb coupling coefficient with dimension of length squared . in order to get equations of motion we need to vary the action with respect to the metric @xmath246 and electromagnetic field @xmath244 respectively",
    "this leads to @xcite , @xmath247=t_{ab } \\\\ \\nabla _ { a}f^{ab}&=&0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath248 is the usual stress tensor for electromagnetic field .",
    "the important thing to notice is that the field equation only contains second order derivatives of the metric , no higher derivatives are present .",
    "this is expected since gauss - bonnet gravity is a subclass of lovelock gravity , which does not contain higher derivative terms of the riemann tensor .",
    "now it is possible to obtain static spherically symmetric solution to this field equation having the form of eq .",
    "( [ geneq1 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that those solutions are asymptotically de sitter or anti - de sitter .",
    "thus this situation would be identical to that in sec .",
    "[ fluidfr ] .",
    "this immediately tells us that only a correspondence between the parameters in this theory have to match with that of charged @xmath0 scenario discussed in an earlier section .    to this end",
    "we must mention that the solution obtained above corresponds to a five - dimensional spacetime , i.e. the line element takes the form : @xmath249 , where @xmath250 .",
    "however as we have been emphasizing that this solution can be interpreted from a brane world point of view , such that the visible brane is characterized by @xmath251 hypersurface .",
    "hence the solution reduces to four dimension with @xmath252 as a set of coordinates . thus on the visible brane",
    "the spherically symmetric solution can be treated at the same footing to those discussed earlier .",
    "such spherically symmetric solutions are obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite and has the particular form with reference to eq .",
    "( [ geneq1 ] ) as @xmath253\\ ] ] where @xmath254 determines the scalar curvature of the spacetime , to which we attribute a positive value .",
    "then form solar system tests and neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite it turns out that @xmath255 has stringent bounds .",
    "also in all astrophysical scenarios the distance from black hole @xmath54 is quiet large , thus for our study we can make a power series expansion of the terms inside the square root and arrive at the following form : @xmath256 then we readily identify this with eq .",
    "( [ frc05 ] ) leading to the following mapping , @xmath257 .",
    "the possibility that @xmath245 may be negative has been discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite . with this identification",
    "we can run all our machinery described in previous sections and obtain all the relevant physical quantities .",
    "all the numerical values for cosmological parameter discussed earlier is directly mapped to that of @xmath245 .",
    "we can also conclude that it has identical structure of equipotential surfaces , with existence of inner and outer cusp .",
    "thus matter outflow can also occur in this topological ds or ads black holes along with possibility of inflow to it .",
    "some numerical estimates can be made for this model following previous discussions .",
    "the angular momentum density for inner and outer marginally stable orbits are , @xmath258 and @xmath259 respectively with @xmath260 . also marginally bound and photon circular orbits have similar expressions .",
    "thus for various alternative gravity theories we have obtained the equipotential surfaces for rotating perfect fluid .",
    "for some of them we have observed dynamical accretion disk requiring inflow , outflow and cusps . while in some cases",
    "the structure was simpler and do not have such dynamical behaviour .",
    "thus we may conclude that black holes in different alternative theories affect accretion disk structure differently .",
    "the effect of additional higher curvature correction terms in the eh action on the structure of equipotential surfaces for perfect fluid rotating around black holes in these modified gravity theories have been investigated . for that purpose",
    "we have performed the whole analysis for an arbitrary static spherically symmetric spacetime .",
    "then we have applied the results obtained to different classes of alternative theories , with higher curvature terms .",
    "these theories include : charged @xmath0 theory , dilaton induced gravity theory and finally the einstein - maxwell - gauss - bonnet gravity . in the @xmath0 theory and emgb theory",
    "the black hole solutions asymptotically behave as ds or ads .",
    "the equilibrium structure of perfect fluid orbiting around these black holes in the above mentioned alternative gravity theories lead to modifications of the equipotential contours .",
    "having provided the basic features let us now summarize the results :    * for the situation , @xmath261 , we always have an open equipotential surface .",
    "the potential is being determined by the relation , @xmath262 .",
    "thus different spherically symmetric solution leads to different equipotential surfaces . *",
    "existence of outer cusp does not facilitate accretion onto the black hole .",
    "we need to have inner cusp for the equipotential surfaces as well , in order to have inflow to the black hole .",
    "note that outer cusp is also necessary for accretion to occur .",
    "* closed equipotential surfaces are possible if and only if the angular momentum lies in the range , @xmath263 .",
    "the quantities , @xmath140 and @xmath141 represents the local minima and maxima of the angular momentum density respectively . for the charged @xmath0 theory closed surfaces comes into existence provided the cosmological parameter @xmath8 satisfies , @xmath264 . while for the emgb gravity we obtain , @xmath265 .",
    "note that these closed surfaces are necessary for existence of toroidal accretion disc .",
    "* the accretion by paczyski mechanism becomes possible , if angular momentum density lies in the range , @xmath266 , where @xmath267 being the corresponding value of angular momentum density for marginally bound circular geodesics . in this scenario ,",
    "the outflow from accretion disc becomes possible through both the inner and outer cusps .",
    "the existence of inner cusp leads to accretion flow directed towards the black hole . * for marginally stable configurations , due to overfilling of marginally closed equipotential surfaces efficient inflow and outflow occurs .",
    "however very near the horizon , the behaviour may change significantly . *",
    "another physical situation of interest corresponds to the angular momentum range : @xmath268 . in this situation",
    "the flow down to the black hole becomes non - existent since open self - crossing surfaces come into existence .",
    "* finally , for the situation where , @xmath157 , the toroidal structure can not exist .",
    "equipotential surfaces exist however they are always open . also the surfaces becomes narrower as it approaches the static radius which may have a significant effect on collimation of jets from the black hole .",
    "these effects were most prominent for accretion of perfect fluid to the black holes in @xmath0 theory and the emgb theory . both of which are asymptotically de sitter for certain choice of parameter space .",
    "richness in the structure of black hole accretion disk for asymptotically de sitter solutions in gr were pointed out earlier in @xcite .",
    "thus it is evident from this work that their generalization to alternative theories also come up with varied structure of the accretion disk .",
    "there are also asymptotically flat solutions like the dilaton black hole , which have new features compared to the gr scenario .",
    "however in this spacetime accretion disk does not posses all the structures which were present in the other two cases .",
    "thus we observe that in einstein gravity as well as in alternative theories spacetime with analogue of repulsive cosmological constant ( for instance , @xmath8 in @xmath0 model , @xmath269 in emgb theory ) shows wide variety of phenomenon as the accretion disk structure is considered . though the structure of the accretion disk changes considerably due to presence of higher curvature correction terms in the eh action it is very difficult to detect their signature astrophysically .",
    "this is mainly due to the reason that the parameter space of these alternative theories for being of astrophysical interest is quiet large compared to present day estimates of those parameters .",
    "for example , the black holes fuelling active galactic nuclei have typical masses in the range , @xmath270 which leads to an estimation of the cosmological parameter as , @xmath271 , which is very small and thus will not result in significant changes in the accretion disk structure .",
    "however the primordial black holes have a much larger value of the cosmological parameter .",
    "thus accretion structure of them could be best hope to test these alternative theories .",
    "however this is beyond the scope of present day observations . even though the departure of the equipotential contours in alternative theories from their general relativistic counterpart due to presence of higher curvature correction terms is an important effect but",
    "is unlikely to be observed in near future .    to summarize , in this work we have discussed various possible candidates for alternative theories and the accretion disk structure in them .",
    "we have also left some questions unanswered . among them the runaway instability criteria for toroidal accretion disks , i.e. stability with time has not been addressed as well as the self - gravitation influence of the disk is also not considered .",
    "these we leave for future .",
