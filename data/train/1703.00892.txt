    "tungsten , the element with atomic number @xmath4 , has moved into the focus of controlled nuclear fusion research because of its unique physical and chemical properties which make it the most suitable material for the wall regions of highest particle and heat load in a fusion reactor vessel  @xcite .",
    "the downside of tungsten as a high-@xmath5 impurity is its extremely high potential for radiative plasma cooling .",
    "minuscule concentrations of tungsten ions in a fusion plasma prevent ignition",
    ". maximum tolerable relative fractions of tungsten in the plasma are of the order of 2@xmath610@xmath7  @xcite . by plasma - wall interactions",
    "tungsten atoms and ions are inevitably released from the surfaces of the vacuum vessel and enter the plasma .",
    "therefore , the understanding of the role of tungsten atoms and ions in a plasma is an essential task of fusion research and development . for the modeling of tungsten plasma impurities and their characteristic line emissions , detailed knowledge about collisional and spectroscopic properties",
    "is required . in order to meet some of the most important requirements a dedicated experimental project",
    "was initiated several years ago with the goal to provide cross section data and spectroscopic information on tungsten ions exposed to collisions with electrons and photons  @xcite .",
    "the main topics of this project are electron - ion recombination , photoionization , and electron - impact ionization of tungsten ions .",
    "results on the recombination of w@xmath8 , w@xmath9 , and w@xmath10 have been published  @xcite .",
    "cross sections and rate coefficients for electron - impact ionization of w@xmath11 and w@xmath9 have also been made available in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the present work adds experimental and theoretical cross sections for single - photon single ionization of w@xmath0 to a series of photoionization studies on tungsten ions in low charge states  @xcite .",
    "measurements of collisional properties of tungsten ions have been mainly restricted to the work within the tungsten project mentioned above .",
    "details of the experimental and partly also the theoretical work have been discussed in a recent review  @xcite and references to a rapidly growing number of theoretical investigations on tungsten atoms in a wide range of charge states have also been provided there .",
    "previous results on photoabsorption by neutral tungsten atoms have served as benchmarks for ab initio photoionization cross section calculations for w atoms  @xcite using the dirac - coulomb r - matrix approximation  @xcite which is implemented in the darc suite of codes  @xcite .",
    "darc uses the complete dirac hamiltonian in the inner - region r - matrix calculations . the coulomb scattering approximation assuming coulomb wave functions and coulomb - scattering boundary conditions",
    "is used in the outer - region .",
    "photoemission by tungsten ions is the basis for plasma diagnostics employing high - resolution spectroscopy .",
    "experimental and theoretical studies of this important topic are numerous .",
    "an overview of related issues and references to theoretical and experimental work has been provided by beiersdorfer  @xcite .    as a rule ,",
    "particle densities in magnetically confined fusion plasmas are too low to support significant absorption of photons emitted by the plasma constituents .",
    "therefore , the fusion - motivated relevance of photoabsorption by tungsten atoms and ions is limited .",
    "photonic interactions are only expected to play a role in the plasma edge region where dust grains may shield radiation emitted from the plasma core  @xcite .",
    "photoionization of tungsten atoms and ions is of plasma - related interest nevertheless because it can provide details about spectroscopic properties of tungsten which are needed for plasma diagnostics and , as time - reversed photorecombination , photoionization may help to better understand one of the most important atomic collision processes in a fusion plasma , namely , electron - ion recombination .    beside its importance in the field of controlled nuclear fusion ,",
    "tungsten is of considerable interest as a prototypical high-@xmath5 element that provides ample opportunities for studying many - electron effects on the structure and collisional properties of atoms and ions .",
    "the present dirac - coulomb r - matrix approximation is one of the most advanced theoretical tools to obtain information about electron - ion and photon - ion interactions in general and is suitable , in particular , for the treatment of atoms and ions characterized by a complex electronic structure .",
    "studies on photoionization of tungsten atoms and ions with their complex electronic structure featuring open @xmath12 and @xmath13 shells and comparison of experimental and theoretical results can provide benchmarks and guidance for future theoretical work on electron - ion interaction processes .",
    "the direct and resonant photoionization processes occurring for the yb - like w@xmath14 ions in the present energy range comprise removal or excitation of either a @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 or @xmath18 electron . for the theoretical description of w@xmath0 ions undergoing the photoionization process",
    ", suitable target wave functions have to be constructed that allow for promotions of electrons from the @xmath19 and @xmath18 subshells to all contributing excited states .",
    "this is extremely challenging for low - charged tungsten ions .",
    "for the tungsten ions in higher charge states , such as w@xmath0 , it is still challenging but expected to be a slightly less daunting task , due primarily to the increased effect of the coulomb charge of the target and the slight reduction in the r - matrix box size .    in this paper",
    "we report on experimental and theoretical cross sections for single photoionization of w@xmath0 ions .",
    "this work provides the next step in our present series of investigations on single - photon single ionization of tungsten atoms / ions in low charge states .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 details the experimental procedure .",
    "section 3 presents a brief outline of the theoretical work .",
    "section 4 presents a discussion of the results obtained from both the experimental and theoretical methods .",
    "finally in section 5 conclusions are drawn from the present investigation .",
    "the experiments on photoionization of w@xmath0 ions made use of the ion - photon beam ( ipb ) endstation of beamline 10.0.1.2 at the advanced light source ( als ) in berkeley , california , usa . for the measurement of absolute cross sections the merged - beams technique  @xcite was employed .",
    "recently , experimental methods for studying photoabsorption by ions and typical results of such experiments have been reviewed by mller  @xcite and schippers  @xcite .",
    "the general layout of the ipb setup and the associated experimental procedures have been described by covington  @xcite .",
    "since the ipb endstation was first implemented nearly two decades ago significant technological improvements have been made .",
    "the most recent account of measurements at the ipb has been published by macaluso  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the methodology used for the photoionization of tungsten ions has been provided in our publication on the results for w@xmath20 ions  @xcite .    here , only an overview of the experiment is given .",
    "aspects specific to the present measurements are discussed in more detail . for the preparation of beams of tungsten ions",
    "w(co)@xmath21 vapour was leaked via a needle valve into the plasma chamber of a 10  ghz electron - cyclotron - resonance ( ecr ) ion source  @xcite .",
    "a steady discharge was maintained by adding ar or xe as a support gas .",
    "a mixture of ions produced from the support gas , the w(co)@xmath21 vapour and other materials present in the plasma chamber was accelerated by a voltage of typically @xmath22 = 6  kv and an ion beam was formed by a suitable set of electrostatic focusing elements . by a subsequent 60@xmath23 dipole magnet",
    "the desired beam component was selected and directed towards an electrostatic spherical 90@xmath23 deflector ( the merger ) which deflected the ion beam onto the photon beam axis .",
    "a mass - over - charge spectrum of ions produced in this manner is provided in the overview  @xcite of the tungsten project initiated at giessen university .",
    "in addition to many exotic fragment species produced from w(co)@xmath21 molecules atomic tungsten ions , w@xmath24 , in a wide range of charge states up to @xmath25 were also obtained .",
    "ion currents of collimated beams of isotope - resolved @xmath26w@xmath0 ions employed in the present experiments were as large as 30  na .    behind the merger the selected w@xmath0 ion beam passed the interaction region which was essentially an electrically isolated drift tube of about 29  cm length .",
    "for the measurement of absolute cross sections the interaction region was set to a potential of up to @xmath27 = 1  kv in order to tag product ions ( electrical charge @xmath28 ) from within the interaction region by their final energy @xmath29 . a 45@xmath23 dipole magnet , the demerger , separated the w@xmath0 parent ion beam from the w@xmath30 products which were deflected out of plane by a spherical 90@xmath23 deflector and directed towards a single - particle detector with almost 100% efficiency  @xcite",
    ". the energy difference @xmath31 between product ions from outside and from inside the interaction region was sufficient for complete separation of the two components by the demerger magnet .",
    "the primary ion beam current was collected by a large faraday cup inside the demerger magnet .",
    "separation of photoionized ions from background was accomplished by mechanically chopping the photon beam and by phase - sensitive recording of detector pulses .",
    "significant contaminations of the @xmath26w@xmath0 beams with molecular ions featuring the identical mass - over - charge ratio ( 46.5 ) can safely be ruled out considering their composition of c and o atoms and the effect that they would have on the observed distribution of tungsten isotopes in the mass spectrum which followed the natural abundances .",
    "moreover the setting of the second magnet to the w@xmath30 product channel precludes the observation of single ionization of any primary ion other than w@xmath0 .    for absolute cross section measurements the beam overlap factor",
    "was determined by scanning x- and y - profiles of the ion beam and the counter - propagating photon beam at three positions along the z - axis in the middle and at the front and rear ends of the interaction region . by energy - tagging the product ions",
    "the length of the interaction region was defined as the length of the isolated drift tube .",
    "the error budget of the absolute cross sections obtained by this procedure has been discussed previously  @xcite and a total systematic uncertainty of 19% was estimated .",
    "this uncertainty does not include problems with the purity of the two merging beams . in a thorough investigation described by mller in the context of photoionization of w@xmath20 ions  @xcite energy - dependent fractions of higher - order radiation in the photon beam up to the sixth order",
    "could be detected and quantified .",
    "a procedure for correcting measured apparent cross sections was developed both with respect to correct normalization of photoionization signal to the photon flux and removal of surplus signal arising from photoionization at the higher energies @xmath32 of the @xmath33th order radiation fractions .",
    "we note that even - order contributions could be only partly suppressed by tightly closing the baffles behind the monochromator and by thus losing most of the flux of the photon beam .",
    "corrections were made for the second- and third - order contaminations of the photon beam neglecting the smaller effects of radiation orders @xmath34 .",
    "the uncertainties of this procedure were added to the total possible error of the measured absolute cross sections as described previously  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainty of the energy axis in the present experiments is estimated to be @xmath35  mev .",
    "a further problem in experiments employing beams of ions with a complex electronic structure is the possible presence of ions in long - lived excited states .",
    "this problem has been discussed previously  @xcite and is particularly relevant for tungsten ion beams .",
    "it is illustrated in the context of photoionization of w@xmath0 ions by the following considerations .",
    "the minimum electron energy required for efficient production of w@xmath24 ions in a continuously operating ion source is determined by the ionization threshold of the associated w@xmath36 ions .",
    "the minimum energy required for producing w@xmath0 from w@xmath37 is @xmath38  ev  @xcite .",
    "there must be a sufficient density of electrons in the discharge carrying about three times that energy  @xcite to facilitate efficient ionization of w@xmath37 .",
    "the charge - state spectrum of tungsten ions measured with the ion - source settings for the optimum production of w@xmath0 ions even showed production of charge states up to w@xmath9 requiring electron energies well above the ionization potential of about 460  ev of w@xmath8 .",
    "thus , the hot component of the electron energy distribution  @xcite has to have a minimum temperature corresponding to @xmath39  ev , because otherwise , the high charge states would not have been produced .",
    "the weight of level @xmath40 with excitation energy @xmath41 in a thermodynamical equilibrium is proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the statistical weight of level @xmath40 . here",
    "the excitation energies are below the ionization energy of 38.2  ev while @xmath44 is greater than 500  ev .",
    "hence , the exponent is greater than @xmath45 , close to 1 .",
    "although there is not really a thermodynamical equilibrium in the source , this argument should be valid for the hot electron component in the source and for all excited states of w@xmath0 .",
    "under such conditions , every excited state of w@xmath0 ions can be populated in the ion source with its statistical weight .",
    "the ions , once produced , are confined in the source plasma for millisecond times  @xcite before they drift out and are extracted and accelerated .",
    "flight times of the accelerated tungsten ions of interest were of the order of 20  @xmath46s between the ion source and the photon - ion interaction region .",
    "most of the excited levels have decayed after such long times .",
    "however , metastable ions can survive and contribute to the photoionization signal .",
    "obvious candidates for metastable excited states in w@xmath0 are associated with the @xmath47 ground - state configuration .",
    "all the levels within one given configuration are long lived since electric dipole transitions between any two states within the configuration are strictly forbidden .",
    "therefore , the parent ion beam must be expected to contain ions in all levels associated with the @xmath47 configuration .",
    "the ground level of the yb - like atomic tungsten ion , w@xmath0 , is @xmath48 .",
    "in addition , the levels @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 have to be considered when comparing experimental results with theory .",
    "state - of - the art theoretical methods were employed to calculate photoionization cross sections for comparison with experiment .",
    "the calculations utilized a parallel version  @xcite of the darc package of computer codes  @xcite designed to investigate interactions of electrons and photons with atoms and their ions .",
    "highly correlated wavefunctions that incorporate relativistic effects were constructed for the hundreds of levels that were considered and scattering calculations were performed for thousands of channels .",
    "such extensive calculations require access to parallel high - performance computer architectures and are currently being performed on a number of platforms worldwide  @xcite . recently",
    ", darc calculations on photoionization cross sections were carried out for se@xmath54@xcite , se@xmath55 @xcite , kr@xmath54 @xcite , xe@xmath54@xcite , xe@xmath56 @xcite , 2p@xmath57 inner - shell studies on si@xmath54 @xcite , ar@xmath54 @xcite , and co@xmath20 @xcite , valence - shell studies on neutral sulphur @xcite , sulphur - like chlorine , cl@xmath20 @xcite , tungsten and its ions ; w @xcite , w@xmath54 @xcite , w@xmath55 and w@xmath37 @xcite .",
    "all of these cross section calculations using the darc codes showed suitable agreement with the measurements made at the advanced light source , bessy ii and soleil radiation facilities . in the present work we concentrate our efforts on photoionization cross section calculations for the w@xmath0 ion to accomplish the next step in our investigations on low charged states of atomic tungsten ions .",

    "this 10-configuration model yielded a total of 669 levels for the w@xmath30 product ion and improved the residual ion energies with the opening of the @xmath15 shell .",

    "the @xmath106 configuration was once again neglected for the reason stated above .",

    "since dipole selection rules apply , total ground - state photoionization cross sections require only the bound - free dipole matrices , @xmath116 .",
    "whereas for the excited metastable states associated with @xmath117 configuration then , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121 are all necessary .    for the ground and metastable initial states of the w@xmath0 ion studied here , the outer region electron - ion collision problem was solved ( in the resonance region below and between all thresholds ) using a fine energy mesh of @xmath122 0.170 mev for all levels investigated .",
    "the present close - coupling calculations for w@xmath0 ions resulted in approximately 4,500 channels with hamiltonians and dipole matrices in excess of 60,000 in size which are solved in the dirac - coulomb approximation  @xcite to obtain the photoionization cross - sections .. the @xmath123-coupled",

    "is represented by the measured energy - scan results normalized to a number of absolute data points .",
    "the dominant feature in the spectrum is a broad jagged peak structure at energies between about 49 and 60  ev .",

    "the origin of the different peaks and their assignment to certain excitation processes is not immediately obvious .",
    "a problem is in the very large number of possible transitions in the investigated energy range .",
    "excitation @xmath124 from the ground configuration @xmath125 to the @xmath126 excited configuration involves 400 dipole transitions spread out over an energy range from about 39 to 65 ev .",
    "if the final subshell is @xmath69 instead of @xmath67 the number of possible dipole transitions goes up to 1546 and the energy range is from about 59 to 85 ev .",
    "the situation becomes even more unclear when the @xmath15 subshell is opened by a one - electron excitation with thousands of possible transitions .",
    "the energy ranges provided above are from fine - structure  resolved calculations with the cowan code  @xcite .",

    "excitations @xmath127 and @xmath128 as well as @xmath129 and @xmath130 with @xmath131 are within the range of the peak features , while @xmath16 excitations occur at higher energies .",
    "the largest oscillator strengths are associated with @xmath127 transitions , followed by @xmath128 transitions .",
    "thus , the calculations suggest that the main resonance group at 54  ev is mainly composed of @xmath124 excitations with contributions of @xmath132 .",
    "the peak at 68 ev might be associated with @xmath133 and @xmath134 transitions and the peak features at higher energies may originate from @xmath135 excitations with @xmath136 .",
    "theoretical cross sections obtained from the darc calculations were convoluted with 200-mev fwhm gaussians to simulate the experimental photon - energy resolution .",

    "panel ( b ) provides the theoretical cross sections for the w@xmath0 ion in the @xmath137 ground level , panels ( c ) through ( k ) show the calculated cross sections for the initial metastable levels @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 , respectively .",
    "the resonance strengths contained in the cross section from the 52-level approximation are not very much different from those resulting from the 730-level model .",
    "the main effect of the larger basis set with the greatly enhanced large - scale configuration - interaction calculation is a redistribution of resonance strengths within the groups of resonances and in most cases a shift of the groups towards lower energies .",
    "this shift results in better agreement of the theoretical with the experimental peak energies .    as discussed in section  [ sec : exp ] the ground - state configuration @xmath125 of w@xmath0 is characterized by two electrons in the @xmath18 subshell while all other subshells below the outermost valence shell are completely filled .",
    "this configuration supports nine fine - structure levels , all with identical parities .",
    "hence , electric dipole transitions between any of these levels are forbidden and accordingly , all these levels have long lifetimes . since the maximum excitation energy within the @xmath117 configuration is only about 5  ev , while the temperature of the hot - electron component in the ion - source plasma is higher by orders of magnitude , it is reasonable to assume that all terms and levels are statistically populated .",
    "statistical population of fine - structure levels within a given term has been verified in previous high - resolution photoionization experiments on berylliumlike ions  @xcite .",
    "hence , for a meaningful comparison with the experiment , the theoretical results for the individual fine - structure levels have been added with their statistical weights relative to the total weight ( 24 ) of the 5d@xmath146 configuration .",

    "see the caption of figure  [ fig : w4comp ] .",
    "the onsets of ionization arising from the three highest levels within the @xmath125 ground - state configuration are identified in the figure .",
    ", width=453 ]    the absolute size of the dominant experimental cross section features is very well reproduced by the large - scale calculation .",
    "there are only slight non - systematic shifts of at most @xmath147  ev between the theoretical and experimental peak energies .",
    "the large basis set chosen for this calculation is obviously sufficient to produce very satisfying results for the photoionization of w@xmath0 ions given the complexity of the problem in which several subshells with high angular momenta are involved .",
    "the vertical ( blue ) bars in figure  [ fig : w4comp ] show the ionization thresholds for the @xmath117 fine - structure levels obtained from the nist tables  @xcite . a non - vanishing cross section below the ground - state ionization threshold indicates the presence of metastable ions in the parent ion beam . the contributions arising from the long - lived excited states within the @xmath117 configuration are already included in the theory curve with their statistical weights .",
    "nevertheless , there is still a non - zero cross section at energies below the ionization potential of the most highly excited @xmath117 fine - structure component , the @xmath145 level .    in order to obtain a clear picture of the low - energy cross - section contributions , a blow - up of the threshold region",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : w4lowe ] . at energies below the steep cross - section onset at about 50",
    "ev there is a group of small but distinct resonance features .",
    "some of these features are above the @xmath145 ionization threshold and therefore might be included in the calculations for the @xmath117 fine - structure levels .",
    "the comparison of the large - scale 730-level calculation with the experimental results shows , however , that the @xmath145 contribution to the cross section is too small to explain the peak features .",
    "clearly , the calculated cross section vanishes at energies below the @xmath145 ionization threshold indicated by the ( blue ) bar at about 46.3  ev while the experimental cross section continues to stay up until a sharp drop - off is reached at about 43.9  ev .",
    "given the energy shifts of the dominant theoretical from the experimental peak structures at about 55  ev one might suspect that there is also an energy shift of theory in the energy range of figure  [ fig : w4lowe ] .",
    "the fact that the onset of the theoretical cross section matches the nist ionization threshold of the @xmath145 level indicates that there is almost no room for such a shift of the theoretical cross section within the energy range of figure  [ fig : w4lowe ] .",
    "hence , one has to conclude that additional metastable levels beyond the highest @xmath117 fine - structure levels must have been present in the parent ion beam of the experiment .",
    "possible candidates for more highly excited metastable levels can be found within the @xmath17- and @xmath15-subshell  excited @xmath148 and @xmath149 configurations where quintet states with more than 30  ev excitation energy can be formed . treating all",
    "the 110 + 206 = 316 levels within those two configurations goes beyond presently available computing resources and is also beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "while the peaks at energies below the @xmath145 ionization threshold might be attributed to contributions arising from levels within the inner - subshell excited configurations the size of the apparent cross sections at energies below 46  ev is at most one fifteenth of the cross section maximum at 54  ev .",
    "therefore , the effect on the present w@xmath0 photoionization cross section arising from metastable levels within the @xmath149 configuration may be expected to be small .",
    "some of the deviations between theory and experiment may have to be attributed , though , to the neglect of more highly excited metastable levels beyond the @xmath117 ground - state configuration in the parent ion beam .",
    "the darc calculations for w@xmath24 with @xmath150 , and @xmath151 show increasingly better agreement with experiments along the sequence of increasing charge states .",
    "this was expected because the physics of more highly charged ions becomes simpler in that the electron - nucleus interactions become more prominent relative to the electron - electron interactions which are difficult to treat .",
    "the comparison of theoretical and experimental cross sections in figure  [ fig : w4comp ] with the good agreement observed here provides a very good example supporting the expectation",
    ". it would be interesting to see how well other theoretical methods can reproduce the experimental results .",
    "a statistical theory based on the concept of quantum many - body chaos has been suggested for the treatment of atomic processes involving interactions of electrons and photons with complex many - electron atoms or ions ( @xcite . the application of this approach to recombination of tungsten ions with an open @xmath15 shell such as w@xmath10  @xcite provided very good overall agreement with the experiment  @xcite .",
    "the quantum - chaos theory may turn out to be also suitable for the present problem of photoionization of w@xmath24 ions in low charge states @xmath152 .",
    "absolute experimental and theoretical cross sections are presented for single photoionization of w@xmath0 .",
    "the measurements were obtained by the merged - beams technique using synchrotron radiation and the calculations were performed in the dirac - coulomb r - matrix approximation .",
    "very satisfactory agreement was obtained , in fact , the best to date between measured and calculated photoionization cross sections along the tungsten isonuclear sequence .",
    "improvement of the theoretical description had been expected with the charge state of the ion increasing and the experimental and theoretical work up to w@xmath0 demonstrate the validity of that assumption .    am acknowledges support by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under project numbers mu-1068/20 and mu-1068/22 .",
