    "anderson localisation is central to understanding of the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite . in particular , the plateau transitions , between different quantised values for the hall conductance ,",
    "reflect delocalisation transitions in each landau level . scaling ideas @xcite provide a framework for understanding these transitions , and are supported by the results of experiment @xcite and of numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "progress towards an analytical theory of the critical point , however , remains limited .",
    "the simplest starting point for such a theory is to neglect electron - electron interactions and consider a single particle moving in a magnetic field with a disordered impurity potential . in pioneering work , pruisken and",
    "collaborators obtained from this a field - theoretic description , in terms of a @xmath0-model .",
    "more recently , in response to the difficulties of extracting quantitative results from the @xmath0-model , several alternative formulations have been explored : read @xcite , lee @xcite and zirnbauer @xcite have investigated spin chains ; lee and wang @xcite have considered the replica limit of hubbard chains ; and ludwig and collaborators @xcite have discussed the dirac equation .",
    "the correspondence between dirac fermions in two space dimensions , and non - relativistic charged particles moving in a magnetic field , stems from the fact that time - reversal symmetry is broken both by a mass term in the two - dimensional dirac equation @xcite , and by a magnetic field in the schrdinger equation .",
    "moreover , as emphasised by ludwig _",
    "et al _ , the hall conductance of dirac fermions , with fixed fermi energy , has a jump of @xmath1 , if the fermion mass is tuned through zero .",
    "the critical behaviour at this transition depends on the symmetries of the hamiltonian .",
    "the dirac equation with only a random vector potential is particularly amenable to analysis @xcite , since the zero - energy eigenstates are known explicitly .",
    "critical properties are controlled by a line of fixed points , and turn out to be different from those expected at plateau transitions in the iqhe .",
    "the line of fixed points , however , is unstable against additional randomness , either in the mass or in the scalar potential , and flow is conjectured @xcite to be towards a generic quantum hall fixed point , describing the same critical behaviour as emerges from the usual schrdinger equation .",
    "confidence that dirac fermions with suitable randomness do indeed have a critical point in the same universality class as the iqhe plateau transitions is clearly strengthened if there exists an explicit mapping from a microscopic model for the iqhe to the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "fisher and fradkin , and subsequent authors @xcite , have reached the dirac equation starting from certain , rather specific , tight - binding models .",
    "an alternative to the tight - binding model , as a description of the iqhe , is the network model @xcite , studied extensively by numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "ludwig and collaborators @xcite have asserted that dirac fermions with the various possible kinds of randomness each represent particular forms of network model .",
    "these authors , however , did not set out a transformation from one model to the other .",
    "separately , lee @xcite found such a transformation , in the particular case of a network model without random phases , obtaining dirac fermions with randomness only in the mass .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe a general mapping from the network model to the dirac hamiltonian in two dimensions , which , in the unrestricted case , has randomness in the mass , the scalar potential and the vector potential .",
    "any approach to this problem must confront the fact that the network model is defined using the language of scattering theory , and therefore , at least in the first instance , contains information only about behaviour at one energy .",
    "the dirac hamiltonian , by contrast , obviously fixes properties of an entire spectrum of eigenstates .",
    "we begin from a unitary matrix defined @xcite for the network model , which , heuristically , can be thought of as a time - evolution operator .",
    "we show , in a continuum limit , that it is the evolution operator for a dirac hamiltonian . in this respect ,",
    "our route is rather different from that of lee @xcite , who obtains a hamiltonian by endowing the phases of the network model with an energy dependence .",
    "we also differ in taking the continuum limit isotropically , while lee @xcite does so anisotropically .",
    "our mapping is described in section ii . in section iii",
    "we examine in detail how edge states of the network model are related to boundary states of dirac fermions .",
    "this is important , since it is these states which are responsible for the quantised hall conductance away from plateau transitions .",
    "equivalence between the network model and the dirac hamiltonian necessarily requires a continuum limit . in section iv , we show that , independently of the continuum limit , one can associate with the network model a tight - binding hamiltonian , which contains only nearest - neighbour hopping .",
    "in this section we construct an explicit mapping from the network model @xcite to the dirac hamiltonian in two dimensions .",
    "first , we recall the physical basis for the network model and its definition .",
    "consider non - relativistic , charged particles moving in a smoothly varying scalar potential in two dimensions , with a strong perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the potential is smooth if its correlation length is much larger than the cyclotron radius , and the field is strong if the cyclotron energy is larger than the amplitude of potential fluctuations . under these conditions , the kinetic energy of cyclotron motion about the guiding centre , and the potential energy associated with the position of the guiding centre ,",
    "are both separately conserved .",
    "we focus on drift of guiding centres along equipotential lines . in the network model , portions of a given equipotential",
    "are represented by directed ` links ' , and the wavefuntion for the particle is caricatured by complex current amplitudes , @xmath2 , defined at points on each link .",
    "on traversing a link , a particle aquires an aharonov - bohm phase : if @xmath3 and @xmath4 are amplitudes at opposite ends of the link @xmath5 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) , @xmath6 .",
    "tunneling between two disjoint portions of equipotential can occur where they are separated by less than a cyclotron radius , as happens near saddle - points in the potential .",
    "it is incorporated into the model at ` nodes ' , where two incoming and two outgoing links meet .",
    "the amplitudes on the four links that meet at a given node may be related by a transfer matrix or by a scattering matrix . in a suitable gauge ,",
    "each of these @xmath7 matrices is real and depends on a single parameter , which we denote by @xmath8 ( for the transfer matrix ) and @xmath9 ( for the scattering matrix ) .",
    "the parameter determines the relative probabilities for a particle to turn to the left or to the right on arriving at the node .",
    "it is a smooth function of the equipotential energy , measured relative to the potential at the saddle - point @xcite . referring to fig .",
    "( 1b ) , one has @xmath10 and @xmath11 the two parameters are related by @xmath12 . on varying the equipotential energy from far below that of the saddlepoint to far above , @xmath9 increases from @xmath13 to @xmath14 ; tunneling is a maximum at @xmath15 .    the network model as a whole",
    "is built by connecting these two elements - links and nodes - to form a lattice .",
    "the simplest choice is the square lattice , illustrated in fig .  2 .",
    "randomness is introduced by choosing each link phase , @xmath16 , independently from a probability distribution .",
    "the model represents particle motion at an energy determined by the value of the node parameters .",
    "if all nodes are identical , and if phases are uniformly distributed between @xmath17 and @xmath18 , the system is critical at @xmath19 , and in the localised phase otherwise .",
    "we follow klesse and metzler @xcite , and associate a unitary matrix with the model . roughly speaking ,",
    "this matrix is a time evolution operator .",
    "let the unit of time be the interval required for a guiding centre to drift from the mid - point of one link , through a node , to the mid - point of the next link ; ignore dispersion in this time interval , arising from variations in drift velocity or in lengths of links .",
    "let @xmath20 be the amplitude for a particle to arrive at a point , @xmath21 , after @xmath22 time - steps , starting from an initial wavefunction @xmath23 .",
    "then @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the required time evolution operator .",
    "eigenfunctions of @xmath25 with eigenvalue @xmath26 are stationary states of the network model .    in eq  [ eqn4 ] ,",
    "the element @xmath27 is non - zero only if there is a one - step path on the lattice from @xmath21 to @xmath28 : that is , a path which follows the directions of the links and passes only one node .",
    "the values of these non - zero elements are given @xcite by a product of a phase factor from the link traversed , and a tunneling amplitude from the node , with sign conventions indicated in fig .",
    "3 .    to be definite ,",
    "consider the system illustrated in fig .",
    "plaquettes are labelled by the coordinates , @xmath29 , of their centres . with our choice of lattice",
    "constant and of orientation for the axes , @xmath29 are a pair of integers , either both even or both odd .",
    "we denote the four links , @xmath30 , making up a plaquette by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , so that a point , @xmath21 , on the network is specified by the combination @xmath33 .",
    "initially , we take the tunneling parameter , @xmath9 , to be the same at every node , and the four phases , @xmath34 , to be the same on every plaquette . in addition",
    ", it is convenient to measure the phases relative to their value when half a flux quantum threads each plaquette , by replacing @xmath35 with @xmath36 .",
    "because each plaquette has four links , the matrix @xmath25 has a @xmath37 block structure , and because the mid - points of links form a bi - partite lattice , each such block consists of two @xmath7 blocks . to exhibit this structure",
    ", we arrange the amplitudes @xmath38 in the order @xmath39 , with @xmath40 and @xmath41 , suppressing the time , @xmath22 , for clarity . in this basis , the evolution operator is @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 here , we have introduced the abbreviations @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the translation operators , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , defined by their action , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the first row of @xmath51 , for example , expresses the fact , illustrated in fig .  4 , that @xmath52 .",
    "in order to decouple @xmath53 from @xmath54 , we consider the two - step evolution operator , @xmath55 we may then deal just with the upper - left block , @xmath56 , in the matrix @xmath57 , and the component - pair @xmath53 . since , at this stage , we are treating a system without disorder , @xmath58 is diagonalised by fourier transform .",
    "we write its eigenvectors , @xmath59 , as @xmath60 and find @xmath61 where @xmath62}\\ , \\cos(\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{4 } ) + q_{y})\\ , , \\\\",
    "\\alpha= e^{i[\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi_{1}-\\phi_{3})+q_{y}]}\\ , [ s^{2}e^{i[\\frac{1}{2 } ( \\phi_{2}-\\phi_{4})+q_{y}]}-c^{2 } e^{-i[\\frac{1}{2}(\\phi_{2}-\\phi_{4})+q_{y}]}]\\ , , \\end{array}\\ ] ] and @xmath63 , @xmath64 are the corresponding complex conjugates .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath58 are @xmath65 with a phase , @xmath66 , given by @xmath67 in which @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "setting @xmath70 , and taking @xmath71 , the range of allowed values for @xmath66 has gaps around @xmath72 and @xmath73 for @xmath74 : @xmath66 satisfies @xmath75 or @xmath76 .",
    "this dispersion relation is illustrated in fig .",
    "stationary states of the network model are characterised by @xmath77 .    to extract from the unitary evolution operator a dirac hamiltonian , @xmath78",
    ", we write @xmath79 and work in the continuum limit , in which @xmath80 is small .",
    "thus we expand around @xmath81 , taking @xmath82 and the link phases , @xmath83 , to be small . to leading order , eq.([eigenvalue ] )",
    "gives the spectrum @xmath84 for small @xmath66 . at an operator level , when @xmath47 and @xmath48 act on smooth functions we make the replacements @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "then @xmath87 finally , to bring the hamiltonian into a conventional form , we make a rotation in the two - component space , setting @xmath88 , with @xmath89 and obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 , and similarly for @xmath92 , and we use the pauli matrix representation @xmath93    now consider a network model with randomness . if the link phases and tunneling parameter vary smoothly in space , one obtains in the continuum limit the dirac hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ dirac1 ] ) , with randomness in the vector potential , scalar potential and mass .",
    "specifically , fluctuations in the vector potential , @xmath94 , arise from randomness in the individual link phases , fluctuations in the scalar potential , @xmath95 , come from variations in the total aharonov - bohm phase associated with each plaquette , and fluctuations in the mass , @xmath82 , are present if the tunneling parameter is not constant everywhere .",
    "the time - independent states of the network model correspond to the zero - energy states of the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "this mapping can also be carried through for generalisations of the network model . in particular",
    ", the two - dimensional model in which each link carries @xmath96 channels @xcite is equivalent to the @xmath97 dirac hamiltonians investigated by fradkin @xcite .",
    "the edge of a sample is , of course , set by a scalar confining potential in the usual description of the iqhe , based on the schrdinger equation .",
    "dirac fermions , by contrast , are confined by a spatially dependent mass , as discussed by ludwig _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "in particular , chiral , zero - energy states of dirac fermions are associated with contours of zero mass @xcite .",
    "we discuss in this section how such edge states emerge in our mapping from the network model to the dirac hamiltonian .",
    "consider a network model defined on a strip of finite width , as in fig .",
    "[ strip ] . for energies in the lower half of the landau level , corresponding to values of the node parameter @xmath98 , all states are localised , while for energies in the upper half of the landau level , for which @xmath99 , a pair of extended states appears , one at each edge of the strip @xcite .",
    "the evolution operator , @xmath58 , acting on the two - component wavefunction , @xmath100 , introduced for the bulk of the system in the preceeding section , is supplemented at the edge by the following boundary conditions ( see fig .  [ strip ] ) : at @xmath101 , the component @xmath102 obeys the same equation as in the bulk , @xmath103_3(0,y ) , \\label{bdy3}\\ ] ] while the component @xmath104 satisfies @xmath105}\\ , z_3(0,y , l ) .",

    "we simplify the discussion by considering a semi - infinite system without disorder , setting @xmath106 for all @xmath30 . without disorder ,",
    "the spatial dependence , for @xmath107 , of such an eigenvector is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 > 0 $ ] ; for @xmath110 , @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are constants .",
    "this ansatz in the equation @xmath114 taking @xmath58 from eqs .",
    "( [ w ] ) ,  ( [ bdy3 ] ) and ( [ bdy1 ] ) , yields @xmath115 confirming that an edge sate exists ( @xmath116 > 0 $ ] ) only for @xmath117 .",
    "similar results also follow if one considers directly the continuum limit .",
    "let the eigenfunctions of @xmath80 be @xmath118 , so that those of @xmath78 are @xmath119 , with @xmath120 .",
    "writing @xmath121 , the boundary condition at @xmath101 , eq .",
    "( [ bdy1 ] ) , is to leading order @xmath122 note that this boundary condition enforces a chiral edge current : the current density , with components @xmath123 , is @xmath124 , and necessarily in the positive @xmath125-direction .",
    "imposing this boundary condition , the dirac hamiltonian , @xmath78 , of eq .",
    "( [ dirac1 ] ) with @xmath126 and @xmath127 has an eigenfunction of energy @xmath128 @xmath129 provided that @xmath130 .",

    "et al _ : setting @xmath132 for @xmath133 , and @xmath134 for @xmath135 , the boundary condition , eq .",
    "( [ boundry ] ) , emerges in the limit @xmath136 .",
    "it is also possible , without taking a continuum limit , to associate a nearest - neighbour tight - binding hamiltonian with the network model .",
    "the sites of the tight - binding model , each carrying one basis state , correspond to the links of the network model . in terms of the one - step evolution matrix , @xmath25 , the tight binding hamiltonian , @xmath137 ,",
    "is simply @xmath138 we indicate schematically in fig .",
    "[ tight - binding ] which matrix elements of @xmath137 are non - zero , and give their values in terms of link phases and the tunneling parameter .",
    "this hamiltonian has two important features .",
    "first , it is natural to introduce a unit cell containing the four sites arising from one plaquette of the network model .",
    "the amplitudes of nearest neighbour hopping _ within _ and _ between _ unit cells have moduli @xmath139 and @xmath140 , respectively , where @xmath9 is the tunneling parameter : they are different , except at the critical point , @xmath141 .",
    "second , the phases of the hopping matrix elements are correlated in the way indicated in fig .",
    "[ tight - binding ] .",
    "it follows from known behaviour of the network model that these correlations have unusual consequences for the tight - binding model .",
    "consider a system in which all link phases are independently and uniformly distributed .",
    "it is straightforward to see that for this system the eigenvalues of @xmath25 in the complex plane are distributed uniformly on the unit circle . as a result",
    ", the density , @xmath142 , of eigenvalues , @xmath128 , of @xmath137 can be given exactly : @xmath143^{1/2}$ ] for @xmath144 and @xmath145 for @xmath146 .",
    "in addition , one can see that the eigenvectors of @xmath25 have the same statistical properties throughout the spectrum , a feature inherited by @xmath137 .",
    "hence the localisation length of eigenstates of @xmath137 is independent of their energy , @xmath128 .",
    "if all nodes have the same parameter value , @xmath9 , then as @xmath147 , the localisation length diverges uniformly across the spectrum : this hamiltonian never has a mobility edge as a function of energy .",
    "we note that @xmath137 is similar in structure to , but different in detail from the tight - binding model used as a depature point by ludwig and collaborators @xcite .",
    "the latter includes not only nearest - neighbour , but also next - nearest neighbour hopping : compare fig .",
    "[ tight - binding ] with fig .  1 of ref  @xcite .",
    "our model also differs from that of fisher and fradkin .",
    "we have set out in detail a mapping , from the network model for plateau transitions in the iqhe , to dirac fermions in two space dimensions .",
    "the mapping makes crucial use of a unitary operator defined for the network model @xcite , which is essentially the time - evolution operator .",
    "the two - component structure of dirac spinors in two space dimensions arises rather naturally from the network model , defined on a square lattice : the fact that each plaquette has four sides suggests a four - component wavefunction , which separates into two independent pairs because of the existence of two sublattices .",
    "this structure is not dependent on the continuum limit , and is also shared by a nearest - neighbour tight - binding hamiltonian , derived directly from the evolution operator .",
