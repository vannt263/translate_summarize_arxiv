    "gravity in @xmath0-dimensional spacetime has been a fascinating area of theoretical investigations during the last few decades .",
    "such studies were initiated in the early 1980s @xcite .",
    "it was once believed @xcite that there is no black hole solutions in @xmath0 dimensions in the absence of a matter source , because there is no propagating degrees of freedom . however , since the discovery of baados - teitelboim - zanelli ( btz ) @xcite and martinez - teitelboim - zanelli ( mtz ) @xcite black holes and the asymptotic conformal symmetry @xcite , it became increasingly clear that gravity in @xmath0 dimensions is much more interesting in its own right , not only because black hole solutions exist but also because such theories are ideal theoretical laboratories for studying ads / cft , ads / cmt ( i.e. , condensed matter theory ) @xcite , gravity - fluid dual @xcite , ( holographic ) phase transitions @xcite , etc .",
    "moreover , the study of gravity in @xmath0 dimensions is also expected to shed some light on the understanding of more realistic or complicated cases of four- and higher dimensional gravities .",
    "recently , @xmath0-dimensional gravity with a matter source has attracted considerable interest . besides the standard maxwell source@xcite , the inclusion of extra scalar field(s ) @xcite , higher rank tensor fields @xcite , higher curvature terms @xcite , and/or gravitational chern - simons terms @xcite are also intensively studied . unlike gravities in four- and higher dimensions , it is possible to include a finite number of higher rank tensor fields in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite . the inclusion of gravitational chern - simons terms will bring in propagating degrees of freedom in @xmath0 dimensions @xcite . moreover , it is often much easier to obtain and analyze black hole solutions in @xmath0 dimensions than in other dimensions .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to study the black hole solution in an einstein - maxwell - scalar gravity with a nonminimally coupled scalar field in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "gravity coupled with a scalar field is not a new idea .",
    "black hole solutions in such theories are known as hairy black holes , and there is already a huge amount of literature on this subject @xcite , and the spacetime is not only restricted to be @xmath0-dimensional @xcite . the scalar field @xmath1 may be coupled either minimally @xcite or nonminimally @xcite to gravity , and it may or may not couple to itself through a self - interacting potential @xmath2 . in the model with which we shall be dealing , @xmath1 couples to gravity in a nonminimal way ,",
    "and it also couples to itself via a self - potential @xmath3 .",
    "the action reads @xmath4 , \\label{action}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is a constant signifying the coupling strength between gravity and the scalar field , and we have set the gravitational constant @xmath6 equal to unity . a similar action in four - dimensional spacetime was studied in ref.@xcite .    in the absence of the scalar potential @xmath3 and the maxwell field ,",
    "the constant value @xmath7 will make the coupling between gravity and the free scalar field @xmath1 conformally invariant . in the presence of @xmath3 , however , the conformal symmetry will , in general , be broken .",
    "nonetheless , the special value @xmath7 for the coupling constant will greatly simplify the solution .",
    "so , we will stick to this particular value of the gravity - scalar coupling .",
    "notice that we did not include explicitly a cosmological constant term in the action ; however , it will turn out that , as far as a black hole solution is concerned , a negative cosmological constant will automatically emerge .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we describe the exact solution to the field equations , which follow from the action ( [ action ] ) as well as the associated scalar potential . some of the basic properties of the scalar potential are discussed .",
    "meanwhile the basic geometric properties of the metric are also outlined . in sec .",
    "3 we describe some special degenerated cases of the solution , some of which are already known in the literature . sec .",
    "4 is devoted to the analysis of the metric , in particular , the conditions for the metric to behave as an asymptotic ads@xmath8 spacetime with a naked singularity , as an extremal charged hairy black hole and as a non - extremal charged hairy black hole are identified . in sec . 5",
    ", we discuss the effect of the scalar and electric charges on the size of the black hole horizons . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we make some discussions and outline some of the open problems that we intend to solve in subsequent investigations .",
    "by a straightforward variational process and discarding all possible boundary terms , we can write down the field equations associated with the action ( [ action ] ) as follows , @xmath9}_{\\mu\\nu}-t^{[a]}_{\\mu\\nu }    + v(\\phi)g_{\\mu\\nu}=0,\\label{einstein}\\\\    & \\square\\phi-\\xi r\\phi - v_{\\phi}=0,\\label{scalar}\\\\    & \\partial_{\\nu}\\big(\\sqrt{-g}f^{\\mu\\nu}\\big)=0,\\label{maxwell}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10}_{\\mu\\nu}&=\\partial_{\\mu}\\phi\\partial_{\\nu}\\phi    -\\frac{1}{2}g_{\\mu\\nu}\\nabla^{\\rho}\\phi\\nabla_{\\rho}\\phi    + \\xi\\big(g_{\\mu\\nu}\\square-\\nabla_{\\mu}\\nabla_{\\nu}+g_{\\mu\\nu }    \\big)\\phi^2,\\\\    t^{[a]}_{\\mu\\nu}&=\\frac { 1}{2}\\bigg(f_{\\mu \\rho}f_{\\nu}{}^{\\rho }    -\\frac{1}{4}g_{\\mu\\nu}f_{\\rho\\sigma}f^{\\rho\\sigma}\\bigg).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as mentioned earlier , we take @xmath7 throughout this paper . note that we did not explicitly specify the scalar potential .",
    "actually , it will be determined uniquely by the form of the metric ansatz to be given below .",
    "the same phenomenon also happens in the study of four - dimensional hairy black holes @xcite .",
    "we are interested in static , circularly symmetric solutions .",
    "to obtain such a solution , we assume that the metric takes the following form , @xmath11 where the coordinate ranges are given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we also assume that both the scalar field @xmath1 and the maxwell field @xmath15 depend only on the radial coordinate @xmath16",
    ". under such assumptions , the maxwell equation ( [ maxwell ] ) gives @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are integration constants , @xmath20 corresponds to the electric charge , and @xmath21 corresponds to the radial position of the zero electric potential surface , which can ( but not necessarily ) be set equal to @xmath22 .",
    "equation ( [ einstein ] ) has only three nontrivial components , i.e. , the ( @xmath23 ) , ( @xmath24 ) , and ( @xmath25 ) components .",
    "the ( @xmath23 ) and ( @xmath24 ) components together give rise to @xmath26 solving this equation , we get @xmath27 even without providing a concrete form for the scalar potential @xmath3 . for @xmath28 not to be singular at finite nonzero @xmath16 , we require @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 can not be simultaneously zero .",
    "note that the special choice @xmath32 , @xmath33 corresponds to constant @xmath1 .    in this paper , we are interested in solutions with a nonconstant scalar field , so we will be considering only the @xmath34 branch of solutions . inserting eq .",
    "( [ phibk ] ) into the remaining field equations , eqs .",
    "( [ einstein ] ) and ( [ scalar ] ) , we can obtain explicit solutions for @xmath35 and @xmath36 as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "however , the result is much too complicated . in particular",
    ", @xmath35 contains terms that are proportional to the product of two logarithm functions and terms proportional to the special function @xmath37 defined as @xmath38 it does not make sense to reproduce the complicated result here .",
    "significant simplifications arise if we take the choice @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in this case , the scalar field becomes @xmath41 and the metric function reads @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are integration constants . in order",
    "that the above @xmath35 is a solution , @xmath36 as a function of @xmath16 must take a very special form .",
    "we can invert @xmath28 for @xmath16 and insert the result in @xmath36 to get the scalar potential @xmath3 : @xmath45 .",
    "\\label{vr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the set of equations ( [ a])([vr ] ) constitute a full set of exact solutions to the system defined by the action ( [ action ] ) , which has not been seen in the literature before . the metric contains four parameters @xmath46 , and @xmath18 . among these , @xmath47 and @xmath18",
    "have already appeared in the solution for the scalar and maxwell fields , respectively .",
    "@xmath48 appears in @xmath3 as a constant term , which plays the role of a ( bare ) cosmological constant . in principle",
    ", the constant @xmath49 can either be positive , zero or negative .",
    "however , if we wish to interpret the solution as a black hole solution , @xmath49 will be necessarily negative , because in @xmath0 dimensions , smooth black hole horizons can exist only in the presence of a negative cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "that is why we adopted the notation @xmath50 from the very beginning .",
    "the last parameter @xmath43 is related to the black hole mass @xmath51 via @xmath52 as will become clear in the degenerate case of a charged btz black hole @xcite which corresponds to the case of @xmath53 . at this point , we do not seem to have any principle to determine the allowed range for @xmath43 .",
    "however , the forthcoming physical analysis will make it clear that the @xmath43 value has to be subjected to some constraints ; otherwise , the solution will become physically unacceptable .      since @xmath54 , we may split @xmath3 into a sum @xmath55 where @xmath2 encodes the true self - interaction of the scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "apart from the bare cosmological constant term and the following @xmath56 term , all the other terms are proportional to @xmath57 , which implies that the scalar self - interaction is in a subtle balance with the coulomb charge , though @xmath1 does not couple directly with the maxwell field .",
    "the seemingly complicated form of the potential ensures that as @xmath58 , the leading term in the power series expansion of @xmath2 behaves as @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 \\right\\}\\phi^6 + \\left(\\frac{q^2}{b^2}\\right)\\,o(\\phi^8 ) , \\label{uexp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where only even powers of @xmath1 are present and the coefficients of all the @xmath61 terms are positive .",
    "some discussions are due here :    * if @xmath62 , then @xmath2 degenerates into a @xmath56 potential , with coefficient @xmath63 . if , in addition , @xmath64 , then the self - coupling of the scalar field vanishes . if @xmath65 , the potential has a single extremum at @xmath66 which is a maximum , implying that the scalar potential is unbounded from below and the system is unstable under small perturbations in @xmath1 . if @xmath67 , the single extremum becomes a minimum , which is stable against small perturbations in @xmath1 .",
    "thus , stability against small perturbations in @xmath1 requires @xmath67 . *",
    "if @xmath68 , @xmath2 will possess more than one extremum .",
    "this is more easily seen in the expanded form ( [ uexp ] ) .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath66 remains an extremum when @xmath68 .",
    "moreover , the term proportional to @xmath69 possesses two minima at some small nonzero @xmath1 .",
    "the inclusion of the power series terms may change the location of these minima , but the qualitative behavior of @xmath2 remains unchanged , i.e. , it has two minima at @xmath70 and one maximum at @xmath66 . * from either the original potential ( [ vr ] ) or its expanded form ( [ uexp ] ) , it seems that we can not take @xmath53 .",
    "however , this observation is completely superficial because the scalar field @xmath1 also depends on @xmath47 .",
    "if we substitute the value of @xmath28 into @xmath3 and then look at the resulting expression , it will be clear that the potential is perfectly regular at @xmath53 .    in order to have more intuitive feelings about the scalar potential at @xmath68 , we present a plot of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath1 as well as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "these are given in figs.[figv(phi ) ] and [ figv(phi(r ) ) ] respectively .",
    "[ figv(phi ) ]     [ figv(phi(r ) ) ]    if @xmath1 takes its value at the local maxima , i.e. @xmath66 , the scalar field equation is automatically satisfied , and the scalar potential is exactly zero .",
    "the corresponding solution is an einstein - maxwell - ads black hole .",
    "one may tends to think that if @xmath1 takes its value at any of the minima @xmath71 , then the corresponding solution would correspond to the true vacuum of the system , with an effective cosmological constant @xmath72 that is more negative than @xmath73 .",
    "however , this is not the case .",
    "if we take @xmath74 , then the field equation ( [ scalar ] ) will force the ricci scalar @xmath75 to be constant , which in turn requires @xmath62 .",
    "but when @xmath62 , the shape of the scalar potential @xmath2 changes drastically , and the two minima at nonconstant @xmath1 totally disappear . despite this , it is still an important observation that when @xmath68 , the scalar potential @xmath3 possesses two minima which are _ smaller _ than the cosmological constant @xmath73 .",
    "the physical explanation for these minima remains open .",
    "because of the very complicated form of the potential @xmath2 , we are unable to find the location of the two minima of @xmath2 analytically . nevertheless , it is easy to find the minima of @xmath2 numerically if the parameters @xmath76 , and @xmath43 were given numeric values .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath77 , we find that the minima of @xmath2 are located at @xmath78 with the approximate value @xmath79      to further characterize the geometry of the solution , we need to calculate some of the associated geometric quantities .",
    "first of all , the ricci scalar contains a curvature singularity at @xmath80 if @xmath68 , @xmath81 higher - order curvature invariants such as @xmath82 and @xmath83 are also singular at @xmath80 , even if @xmath62 .",
    "however , the expressions for these invariants are much more complicated and unillustrative , so we do not reproduce them here",
    ". the cotton tensor @xmath84 is nonvanishing if either @xmath85 or @xmath68 , @xmath86 @xmath87 in @xmath0 dimensions , the nonvanishing cotton tensor signifies that the metric is nonconformally flat @xcite .",
    "thus the hairy ( @xmath88 ) and charged ( @xmath68 ) solutions are geometrically quite different from the case of the static uncharged btz black hole @xcite .",
    "before going into detailed analysis of our solution , we would like to point out some of the degenerated cases .",
    "some of the degenerated cases have already been found in the literature .      when @xmath53 , the scalar field @xmath1 vanishes , and the system becomes the einstein - maxwell - ads theory .",
    "the solution degenerates into the already known static charged btz black hole @xcite : @xmath89 where @xmath51 is the mass of the btz black hole . as mentioned earlier , although this solution may be stable in the einstein - maxwell - ads theory , it is an unstable solution in the full theory ( [ action ] ) .",
    "the maxwell field can be removed by setting @xmath62 . in this case",
    "we get an uncharged hairy ads black hole solution @xmath90 using eq.([m ] ) , we can change @xmath43 into @xmath91 everywhere in the solution . in this case , the ricci scalar becomes constant , @xmath92 however , higher - curvature invariants are still singular at @xmath80",
    ". this solution has already appeared in sec .",
    "5.1 of ref.@xcite .",
    "as will become clear later , we need @xmath93 $ ] in order for this solution to be physically well behaving .",
    "in addition to setting @xmath62 , we can choose @xmath64 in the meantime .",
    "under such conditions , we reproduce the conformally dressed black hole in @xmath94 dimensions @xcite : @xmath95 note that althought the scalar field is still present , the self - interaction potential @xmath2 vanishes , thus making the scalar field a `` free '' massless field .",
    "we may also choose @xmath64 while keeping @xmath18 nonvanishing .",
    "then we get a special charged hairy ads black hole @xmath96.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the merit of this special case is that the scalar potential @xmath2 is not fine - tuned with the cosmological constant .",
    "among the three fields @xmath97 , @xmath15 , and @xmath1 , the latter two are easily understandable .",
    "@xmath15 is just the standard coulomb potential in @xmath0 dimensions , @xmath1 is a radially distributed scalar , which takes its maximum @xmath98 at @xmath80 and decreases gradually to zero as @xmath99 when @xmath88 .",
    "the metric @xmath97 is more involved to be able to understand .",
    "this is because of the complicated form ( [ fr ] ) of the metric function @xmath35 . as usual , the zeros of @xmath35 ( if any ) will correspond to horizons in the metric .",
    "so , we need to find ( at least the condition for the existence of ) the zeros of @xmath35 .",
    "when @xmath62 , the functions @xmath35 and @xmath100 are simplified drastically , @xmath101 we may divide the solution in three subcases :    * if @xmath102 , @xmath35 will always be positive , implying that the metric corresponds to an asymptotically ads@xmath103 spacetime containing a naked singularity .",
    "this is a physically uninteresting case . *",
    "if @xmath104 , then the metric degenerates into the @xmath0-dimensional empty topological ads spacetime . * if , instead , @xmath105 , then @xmath100 will remain positive for @xmath106 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath107 as @xmath108 , @xmath109 as @xmath99 .",
    "this implies @xmath35 increases monotonically and , hence , contains exactly one zero .",
    "the zero of @xmath35 corresponds to the event horizon of a neutral ads black hole with a scalar hair .    combining with the analysis made in sec .",
    "2.2 , we see that the physically acceptable range for the parameter @xmath43 is @xmath110 $ ] at @xmath62 .",
    "the form of @xmath35 with nonvanishing @xmath18 is much more complicated than the @xmath62 case . to find whether @xmath35 has some zeros",
    ", we need to know the asymptotic behavior and the number of the extrema of @xmath35 .    from eq.([fr ] ) it can be seen that @xmath35 is dominated by the term @xmath111 in the far region , so , @xmath109 as @xmath112 . on the other hand , as @xmath108 , @xmath35 is dominated by the term @xmath113 if @xmath114 , or by the term @xmath115 if @xmath53 .",
    "so , @xmath35 always approaches @xmath22 as @xmath108 .",
    "remember that we have excluded the possibility of choosing @xmath116 in order that @xmath28 is not singular at finite nonzero @xmath16 . combining the asymptotic behaviors at both ends",
    ", we see that for @xmath68 , @xmath35 will approach @xmath22 at both ends .",
    "therefore , @xmath35 has to have some extrema , and the total number of extrema must be odd .",
    "let us denote the location of the extrema of @xmath35 by @xmath117 .",
    "if @xmath35 has more than one extremum , an extra index may be adopted to distinguish these different extrema if necessary .",
    "clearly , the position @xmath117 of every extremum of @xmath35 obeys @xmath118 , or , more conveniently @xmath119 where @xmath120 is given by the following expression @xmath121 however , the converse needs not to be true : if @xmath120 happens to be zero at some of its extrema @xmath122 ( not to be confused with @xmath117 ) , then @xmath122 will correspond to an inflection point of @xmath35 , rather than an extremum .    in order to determine the number of roots for @xmath35",
    ", we need to consider two distinct cases , i.e. @xmath53 and @xmath88 . for @xmath53 , it is easy to get the location of the extremum of @xmath35 using eqs.([extrema ] ) and ( [ cd ] ) .",
    "the only real positive extremum of @xmath35 in this case is located at @xmath123 . inserting the value of @xmath117 and @xmath53 into the solution ( [ fr ] ) , we get the following :    * if @xmath124 , we have @xmath125 .",
    "so @xmath35 will have two zeros , each corresponding to a black hole horizon . among these",

    "clearly this is a minimum . substituting this value of @xmath16 into @xmath132 itself , we find the minimum value of @xmath132 , which reads @xmath135 if @xmath136 , then @xmath137 is positive , which implies that @xmath132 has no real positive root , which in turn implies that @xmath120 has no extrema for @xmath138 , so that @xmath100 has only one root , i.e. @xmath35 has only one extremum .",
    "if @xmath139 , then @xmath132 is zero at its extremum .",
    "this means that @xmath132 has only one root that is located at its minimum .",

    "the problem becomes more complicated when @xmath141 . in this case",

    "the only difference lies in the fact that @xmath178 is fixed at the value @xmath184 when @xmath53 , while for @xmath185 , its value is given by eq.([prho ] ) .",
    "we have already made it clear that when @xmath53 or @xmath160 , or when @xmath141 with @xmath162 or @xmath163 , @xmath35 always has only a single minimum .",
    "so , for these parameter ranges , the zero @xmath128 of @xmath35 as described in eqs.([brex ] ) and ( [ prho ] ) is the only zero and minimum of @xmath35 .",
    "so , these cases correspond to extremal black holes with horizon radius @xmath186    if at the extremum @xmath117 of @xmath35 , @xmath167 fails to be zero , then the corresponding solution will not correspond to an extremal black hole .",
    "let us now consider such cases in more detail .    for all @xmath187 , we have @xmath188 i.e. @xmath167 increases monotonically for @xmath189",
    "so , if @xmath190 , then @xmath117 must be located to the left of @xmath128 , i.e. @xmath191 . however ,",
    "if @xmath192 , we can not deduce from above that @xmath193 .",
    "consider the following identity : @xmath194 this is equivalent to @xmath195 if @xmath125 , then @xmath196 in eq.([non - extr ] ) , @xmath117 may be extremely close to @xmath128 , while still keeping @xmath197 .",
    "so , we may think of @xmath198 to be the condition that must be imposed on the parameter @xmath43 in order for the metric to have two disjoint horizons , to behave as a nonextremal black hole . if @xmath199 , then @xmath200 under this condition , the metric contains no horizons and corresponds to an asymptotically ads@xmath103 spacetime with a naked singularity .",
    "what remains untouched is the real troublesome case with @xmath141 and @xmath158 . in this parameter range",
    ", we have to be careful about how many zeros there are for @xmath35 , because @xmath35 has three extrema .",
    "let us denote the location of the three extrema by @xmath201 and @xmath202 respectively .",
    "let @xmath201 and @xmath202 be ordered such that @xmath203 . at these points ,",
    "@xmath120 vanishes , and its two positive extrema locate between these zeros , i.e. @xmath204 from the appendix , we have @xmath205 , so , @xmath206 therefore , according to ( [ px ] ) , we have @xmath207 i.e. @xmath208 . since @xmath209 lies in between @xmath210 and @xmath202 , it corresponds to the _ local maximum _ of @xmath35 , so the above result implies that @xmath35 is negative at all its three extrema .",
    "combining with the asymptotic behavior , we deduce that @xmath35 have precisely two zeros in this case , so , whenever @xmath35 has three extrema , the solution corresponds to a nonextremal charged hairy black hole with ads asymptotics .",
    "please note that , for this case , we have @xmath211    putting all the cases together , we see that the physically acceptable upper bound for @xmath43 at @xmath68 is @xmath212 depending on the value of @xmath128 determined by eqs.([brex ] ) and ( [ prho ] ) , this upper bound can be either positive or negative .",
    "meanwhile , for @xmath68 , the scalar potential @xmath2 is dominated by the @xmath61 terms when @xmath1 is big enough , so we do not need to worry about the existence of lower bound for the scalar potential . accordingly",
    ", there is no lower bound for the parameter @xmath43 .",
    "in this section , we shall restrict ourselves to the cases in which ( a ) black hole horizon(s ) exist(s ) .",
    "the primitive goal of this section is to understand the effects of the scalar and electric charges on the size of the black hole . of course , the best way to do this is to consider the effect of each charge independently .",
    "the parameter @xmath47 originates solely from the scalar field @xmath1 , but it is also carried by the black hole solution , so this parameter may be regarded as a scalar charge of the hole . in order to understand the effect of the scalar charge @xmath47 on the size of the black hole , we need to separate the metric function @xmath35 into @xmath47-independent and @xmath47-dependent parts . according to eq.([fr ] ) , @xmath35 depends on @xmath47 only linearly , so , @xmath213 where @xmath214 .",
    "\\label{fb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the dominant term @xmath111 as @xmath112 is contained in the @xmath215 . solving @xmath216 out of the horizon condition @xmath217 and substituting in ( [ fb ] ) , we get @xmath218 where @xmath16 must be understood as the horizon radius .",
    "it is clear that @xmath219 provided @xmath88 and @xmath220 .",
    "we already know from the previous section that the horizon radius for the extremal black hole is @xmath221 with @xmath222 , and , in general , the radius @xmath223 for the outer horizon of the nonextremal black hole is bigger yet than @xmath128 ; we see that the effect of inclusion of the @xmath224 term in @xmath35 is to make @xmath35 more negative .",
    "therefore , to compensate for this extra negative contribution , the @xmath215 term must become more positive in order to make a zero for @xmath35 .",
    "in other words , the size of the black hole must increase as @xmath47 increases .",
    "we can also separate @xmath35 into its @xmath225-independent and @xmath225-dependent parts , i.e. @xmath226 where @xmath227 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the horizon condition is a proper balance between the @xmath228 and the @xmath229 terms . in sec .",
    "4.1 , it was shown that @xmath230 as @xmath108 and increases monotonically with @xmath16 .",
    "on the other hand , from the above expression , we see that @xmath231 as @xmath108 and _ decreases monotonically _ with @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , in the `` near end '' ( @xmath108 ) , the term @xmath232 in @xmath229 takes over the term @xmath233 in @xmath228 , and in the far region ( @xmath112 ) , the term @xmath111 in @xmath228 dominates , while @xmath229 becomes increasingly negative . in effect , the inclusion of the @xmath229 term in @xmath35 results in two different consequences : in the near region , @xmath35 develops a novel zero , which is the inner horizon for the charged black hole ; in the far region , the original zero of @xmath228 ( now being the outer horizon of the charged black hole ) gets increased with the inclusion of the @xmath229 term , and as @xmath225 increases , the radius of the outer horizon also increases monotonically .",
    "in this paper , we obtained an exact solution for the einstein - maxwell - scalar theory in @xmath0 dimensions , in which the scalar field couples to gravity nonminimally and also couples to itself in a peculiar way .",
    "the solution is static , circularly symmetric , and the scalar self - potential is completely determined by staticness and the circular symmetry of the solution . in particular , a negative cosmological constant naturally emerges as a constant term in the scalar potential if we require that , for certain ranges of parameters , the solution represents a charged hairy black hole . under the proper choices of parameter values , our solution degenerates into some already known @xmath0-dimensional black hole solutions .",
    "when the electric charge @xmath18 is nonzero , the scalar potential possesses three extrema , one maximum at @xmath66 and two minima at @xmath234 .",
    "the scalar field @xmath1 can not stay at the constant value @xmath235 ; otherwise , the field equations will not be satisfied .",
    "we also identified the conditions for the metric to behave as a charged extremal black hole , as an asymptotically ads@xmath103 spacetime with a naked singularity at the origin , and as a charged nonextremal black hole .",
    "when black hole horizons exist , it is shown that the size of the ( outer ) horizon increases monotonically with both the scalar charge and the electric charge .",
    "some of the related properties and duality relations will become instantly interesting further tasks to be worked out .",
    "these are :    * the thermodynamic quantities and the associated laws of thermodynamics ; * the properties of the boundary cft , if any ; * that these days the fluid dual of ads gravity is an active area of study and it will be interesting to ask whether there is fluid dual of the black hole solution given in this paper ; * that the solution considered in this paper is only static and circularly symmetric , and it would be interesting to ask whether one can find more complicated solutions to the same theory ( for instance , it is interesting to ask whether one can find rotationally symmetric solutions and determine the scalar self - interaction solely by the form of the metric ansatz ) ; * that the scalar field in model of this paper is neutral and does not couple to the electromagnetic field , and it would also be interesting to allow the scalar field to become complex and thus couple directly to the electromagnetic field .",
    "we leave the answer to all these problems for future work .",
    "in this appendix we shall solve the root of the function @xmath132 given by eq.([gri ] ) , i.e. , the root of the equation @xmath236 with the aid of a computer algebra system like maple , it is easy to find that the roots of the above equation are given by @xmath237,\\\\ r_3&=\\frac{1}{12}\\left[-z-\\frac{q^2\\ell^2}{z }     -i\\sqrt{3}\\left(z-\\frac{q^2\\ell^2}{z}\\right)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath238{-6b q^2 \\ell^2 + \\sqrt{36 b q^4 \\ell^4-q^6\\ell^6}}. \\label{z1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] among the three roots of @xmath132 , only the real positive roots are relevant to our problem .",
    "so we need to identify which and how many of the roots are real positive .",
    "it is evident that if @xmath239 , then @xmath240 is real .",
    "it follows that if @xmath241 , then @xmath142 is real but negative , while both @xmath143 and @xmath242 are complex .",
    "if @xmath139 , then @xmath142 and @xmath143 will become degenerate and both are real positive . in this case",
    "@xmath242 is negative .",
    "if @xmath243 , @xmath240 becomes complex . in this case , it is not too difficult to see that the modulus of @xmath240 is equal to @xmath244 , so we can denote @xmath240 as @xmath245 comparing this expression with the original definition ( [ z1 ] ) , we see that @xmath246 must take value in the range @xmath247 and the three roots of @xmath132 can be reparametrized as @xmath248 it is easy to see that @xmath249 all three roots are real ; however , only @xmath142 and @xmath143 are positive . clearly , @xmath142 is the bigger root of @xmath132 ."
