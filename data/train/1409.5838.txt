    "the line broadening in excess of thermal broadening seen in optical spectroscopic studies of @xmath1 regions has been attributed to turbulence in the photoionized gas .",
    "there are many examples in the literature of attempts to identify the presence and characterize this turbulence , for example @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references cited by these papers . in these studies , the variation of the point - to - point radial velocities with scale was investigated using structure functions following .",
    "a general finding of these studies is that the structure function derived from these observations does not follow that predicted by kolmogorov s law @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this result is that kolmogorov s law for incompressible and subsonic turbulent flows can not be strictly applied to the photoionized gas in @xmath1 regions , which will be compressible and possibly mildly supersonic @xcite , or that energy does not cascade from larger to smaller scales but is input at many scales .",
    "moreover , the results differ according to which emission lines are used in the study , since the topology of the emitting gas will be different .",
    "for instance , the [ @xmath2@xmath35007 line comes from gas in the interior of an @xmath1 region , whereas the [ @xmath4@xmath36731 line comes from the vicinity of the ionization front , essentially a two - dimensional surface .",
    "the suggested mechanisms responsible for the generation and maintenance of the turbulent velocities in @xmath1 regions include photoevaporated flows from globules and stellar winds .    in order to construct the structure functions for the velocity fields , observations at many points in an @xmath1 region",
    "are needed .",
    "this can be achieved either by multiple longslit spectroscopic observations at many positions across a nebula , or by fabry - perot interferometry .",
    "longslit observations with high velocity resolution have enabled several velocity components to be identified for emission lines of metal ions for which the thermal widths are small , e.g. , [ @xmath2@xmath35007 .",
    "these observations have been used to determine the radial velocities of the principal components of the emitting gas at hundreds of positions within the nebula .",
    "fabry - perot observations produce datasets of thousands of radial velocities , but without the velocity resolution to distinguish between different velocity components .",
    "obviously , in order to obtain a structure function over a wide range of scales , very high quality data with an ample spatial coverage are required . in the case of longslit spectra , this is a non - trivial task , not least the calibrating of the positions of the slits .",
    "@xcite suggested that turbulence is ubiquitous in astrophysics and that it could be analysed statistically via the spectrum of the velocity field , which expresses the correlations between instantaneous velocity components at all possible pairs of points in the medium .",
    "turbulence develops in a fluid when velocity advection is dominant over dissipation ( high reynolds number ) , then continuous injection of energy is required in order to maintain the turbulent state .",
    "one of the main assumptions of the kolmogorov theory of turbulence is that energy is only injected at large scales and is dissipated only at small scales .",
    "this implies that the energy cascades from large to small scales without dissipation .",
    "another assumption of this theory is that in the range between injection and dissipation scales the energy is transferred at a constant rate , and this range is called the inertial range .",
    "turbulence is often described in terms of the energy spectrum @xmath5 , and the inertial range is represented by a power - law relationship @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the wave number . for incompressible , homogeneous , isotropic , 3d turbulence @xcite , we have @xmath8 , while in the limit of high mach number , shock - dominated turbulence in one dimension @xcite , the power law is @xmath9 .",
    "it has proved more difficult to obtain exact results for the general case of 3d compressible , hydrodynamic turbulence .",
    "scaling laws suggest that the original kolmogorov energy spectrum scaling should be preserved even for highly compressible turbulence if the density weighted velocity @xmath10 is taken instead of the pure velocity @xmath11 .",
    "recent work by @xcite predicts the relation @xmath12 for compressible , isothermal turbulence with compressive driving , with a turnover around the sonic scale to @xmath13 .",
    "this has been confirmed by extremely high resolution numerical experiments @xcite .",
    "another important prediction of the kolmogorov theory is the scaling of the structure function of any order .",
    "the universality of such scaling laws has been tested by detailed numerical experiments . even in numerical experiments of incompressible , homogeneous and isotropic turbulence with energy injection at a fixed large scale , it is found that the exponents of the higher order structure functions have an anomalous behaviour , which has been interpreted as the result of spatial and/or temporal intermittency .",
    "intermittency is a sparseness in space and time of strong structures associated with the dissipation or injection of energy @xcite .",
    "since astrophysical turbulence driven by real physical phenomena is almost certainly intermittent , it is important to understand the possible effects of intermittency on the derived statistical properties of real @xmath1 regions .",
    "the three - dimensional properties of the density and velocity fields that describe the turbulence in the interstellar medium , in this case an @xmath1 region , must be deduced from the statistical properties of the observed quantities . for photoionized gas",
    ", the observations generally consist of spectra at different positions , from which centroid velocities and linewidths can be obtained . for optical line emission ,",
    "the emissivity depends on density , temperature and ionization state and therefore an analysis of the emission lines will not just be providing information on the turbulent velocity fluctuations in the gas .",
    "the observations are a two - dimensional projection of the three - dimensional properties and much effort has been dedicated to the problem of recovering 3d information from 2d data .",
    "generally , some simplifying assumptions , such as isothermal gas and statistical isotropy of the turbulence , must be made .",
    "recent modeling of @xmath1 regions has addressed the origin of the irregular structures , filaments , and globules seen within and around the borders in optical images .",
    "morphologically , the simulated emission - line images are very reminiscent of observed @xmath1 regions and the global dynamics , as measured by the r.m.s .",
    "velocity , is also similar to observationally derived values .",
    "the internal dynamics of the simulated @xmath1 regions is due mainly to the interaction of photoevaporated flows from the heads of the filaments and clumps , which flow into the interior of the @xmath1 region , superimposed on the general expansion of the @xmath1 region .",
    "however , the dynamics of real @xmath1 regions could also be affected at large scales by the action of stellar winds from the ionizing star or stars , and at small scales by outflows from young , low - mass stars .    in this paper",
    "we investigate to what extent our numerical simulations of @xmath1 regions model observed statistical properties of real @xmath1 regions . in   [ sec : nummod ] we briefly describe the numerical methods used in the radiation - hydrodynamics simulations and in the calculation of the simulated emission - line radiation , and how the statistical information is obtained from these calculations . in   [ sec : results ] we describe our results for the expansion of an @xmath1 region in a turbulent , clumpy molecular cloud .",
    "we discuss these results in ",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , and comment on the extent to which the statistical properties of the numerical simulations agree with those of observed @xmath1 regions . in ",
    "[ sec : summary ] we summarize and present our conclusions .",
    "we perform radiation - hydrodynamic simulations of the expansion of photoionized regions in a non - uniform initially neutral medium .",
    "the central ionizing source has an effective temperature of 37,500  k and an ionizing photon rate of @xmath14  s@xmath15 , which corresponds approximately to an o7 star .",
    "the simulation takes as an initial condition a clumpy medium with mean density @xmath16  @xmath17 , which results from a self - gravitating forced turbulence simulation by @xcite .",
    "the computational cube represents a spatial volume of 4  pc@xmath18 and the initial temperature is 5  k.    the radiation - hydrodynamics code used in the present paper does not include self gravity .",
    "however , although the initial conditions would be gravitationally unstable in the absence of photoionization heating , on the relatively short timescales of the simulations ( @xmath19  yrs ) this will not be important since the global free - fall time of the computational cube is @xmath20  yrs .",
    "the radiation - hydrodynamics code used in this paper is the same as that used by @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics is calculated using the nonrelativistic roe solver ppm scheme described in with the addition of a local oscillation filter to suppress numerical odd - even decoupling behind radiatively cooling shock waves .",
    "heating and cooling in the ionized and neutral gas is dealt with in the same manner as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "the radiation transport and photoionization makes use of the c@xmath21-ray ( conservative - causal ray ) code developed by @xcite .",
    "the calculations are all performed on a fixed , uniform cartesian grid in three dimensions with a resolution of @xmath22 cells .      the emissivity cubes for the h@xmath23 recombination line and the [ @xmath2@xmath35007 , [ @xmath24@xmath36584 and [ @xmath4@xmath36731 collisionally excited lines are calculated as described in , with the assumption that the heavy element ionization fractions are fixed functions of the hydrogen ionization fractions , calibrated with the cloudy photoionization code @xcite .",
    "the emissivity statistics have contributions from velocity , density , temperature and ionization state fluctuations .",
    "obviously , the velocity fluctuations are the most dynamically important statistic and spectral line data , both real and simulated , can be used to extract statistical information for the different contributions . in particular , the second - order structure function of the velocity centroids and the technique of velocity - channel analysis ( vca ; @xcite ) have been widely used .    in this paper , we calculate the second - order structure function of the velocity centroids of the simulated emission lines and also apply vca to the corresponding position - position - velocity ( ppv ) datacubes .",
    "in addition , we calculate the power spectrum of the velocity field , both weighted and unweighted , of the 3d hydrodynamic simulation datacube in an attempt to relate the observed statistics to the underlying hydrodynamics .      the power spectrum is a statistical tool that is useful for describing the intrinsic properties of , for example , velocity and density fields or any other physical property .",
    "it is the fourier transform of the auto - correlation function of the physical quantity .",
    "for example , the n - dimensional auto - correlation function of the physical quantity @xmath25 can be written @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the spatial position and @xmath28 is the spatial separation .",
    "the n - dimensional power spectrum is then @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the wavenumber , which is related to the scale by @xmath31 , and the integration is performed over all n - dimensional space .",
    "the energy spectrum is the angle integral of the power spectrum over shells of radius @xmath32 , such that @xmath33 .",
    "often the power spectrum can be represented by a power law @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , the velocity field for incompressible , homogeneous @xcite turbulence has @xmath35 , while for shock - dominated turbulence @xcite , the 3d power - law index is @xmath36 .      the use of positional fluctuations in the velocity centroids of spectral lines as probes of turbulent gas motions was developed in the 1950s by , for example , @xcite , and has been applied to observations of molecular emission lines in molecular cloud complexes and to optical emission lines in the orion nebula , galactic and extragalactic @xmath1 regions .",
    "the plane - of - the - sky velocity centroid map is calculated from the first two velocity moments @xmath37 of the simulated line intensity maps @xmath38 , where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the radial ( line - of - sight ) velocity , for convenience taken to be along one of the principal axes of the 3d data cube .",
    "the centroids are then @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the projection plane ( plane of the sky ) when the line of sight is along the @xmath43-axis",
    ". the limits of the integration over velocity are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which represent the full range of velocities produced by the simulations plus thermal broadening , where the thermal width is @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the atomic mass .",

    "the summation in equation  [ eq : strucfunc ] is over all data pairs for each separation , @xmath52 , while the summations in the centroid variation and mean are over the total number of array elements , i.e. , pixels in the @xmath42-plane .    for homogeneous , incompressible ( kolmogorov ) turbulence ,",
    "the velocity fluctuations scale as @xmath53 and hence the second - order structure function scales like @xmath54 .",
    "for isotropic velocity fields , the structure function and the auto - correlation function ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : corrfn ] ) have the same scaling and differ only by a constant .",
    "the structure function is therefore related to the power spectrum .",
    "if the power - law index of the 3d structure function is @xmath55 , then the power - law index of the 3d power spectrum is @xmath56 .",
    "the relationship between the velocity centroids and the statistics of the velocity field is only reliable if the density fluctuations are negligible .",
    "velocity channel analysis was developed to extract the separate contributions of density and velocity from spectral line data cubes .",
    "this is a technique for analyzing position - position - velocity ( ppv ) cubes developed by @xcite . with this method ,",
    "spectroscopic observations are not reduced to velocity centroids as a function of position on the plane of the sky . instead , the ppv cubes are analyzed in terms of velocity channels , or slices , as a function of the velocity resolution used . as the width of the velocity slices increases",
    ", the relative contribution of a velocity fluctuation to the total intensity fluctuations decreases , because the contributions from many velocity fluctuations will be averaged out in thicker velocity slices .",
    "a slice is described as _",
    "thick _ when the dispersion of turbulent velocities is less than the velocity slice thickness on the turbulence scale studied , otherwise the slice is _ thin _ .",
    "in the thickest velocity channels , we obtain only information about the density fluctuations , since the velocity information is averaged out .",
    "conversely , the velocity fluctuations dominate in thin channels .    velocity channel analysis ( vca ) consists of obtaining the 2d power spectrum for each velocity channel and then averaging over all velocity channels for each ppv cube .",
    "@xcite stress that whether a slice in velocity space is considered _ thin _ or _ thick _ depends not only on the slice width @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the number of channels , but also on the scale of the turbulence . for power - law statistics , the velocity dispersion scales as @xmath59 , where @xmath55 is the velocity structure function index .",
    "the criterion for a channel to be considered thin is @xmath60 , hence we do not expect a pure power - law result from the averaged 2d power - spectra analysis . this is because the largest scales , of the order of the size of the cube , are almost always in the _ thin _ regime . at the smallest scales ,",
    "numerical dissipation plays a rle , and there is an additional deviation from the power law .",
    "taking into account the thermal width of the optically thin emission line introduces an additional limitation on the resolution that can be used to discriminate between the _ thick _ and _ thin _ regimes . for a fixed velocity resolution",

    "the effect of projecting a three - dimensional correlation function onto a two - dimensional space has been studied by , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others . for the velocity field",
    ", the two - dimensional case corresponds to the emission - line velocity centroid map .",
    "previous authors have established that for an isotropic , power - law , three - dimensional power spectrum , the spectral index does not change on going from three dimensions to two ( projected ) dimensions , i.e. @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the power spectrum spectral index in @xmath58 dimensions ( defined as @xmath67 , ) . this is because the line - of - sight contribution to the line - of - sight velocity has no amplitude on the @xmath68 plane , where @xmath43 is the line - of - sight direction .",
    "the relationship between the power spectrum spectral index and the exponent of the second - order structure function for homogeneous turbulence is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the power - law index of the @xmath58-dimensional second - order structure function . for projection from 3 to 2 dimensions",
    ", we therefore have @xmath71 , and this is known as _",

    "when the line - of sight depth is small compared to the plane - of - the sky size of the emitting region , the distribution of emittors is essentially two - dimensional ( sheet - like ) and we would expect @xmath78 .    in order to compensate for the effects of density inhomogeneities",
    ", @xcite introduced a correction term @xmath79 such that @xmath80 , where @xmath79 tends to @xmath81 when density fluctuations are important .",
    "this idea was applied by @xcite in an effort to use 2d observational statistics to infer the 3d velocity field of photoionized gas in giant extragalactic @xmath1 regions .",
    "+     we begin by considering the morphological appearance of the simulated @xmath1 regions . figure  [ fig : hiiimages ] shows the evolutionary sequence from 150,000 to 300,000  years .",

    "emission from the dense , neutral zones is negligible and for the production of these images we also include dust extinction in the radiative transfer for the projection to the plane of the sky , with the assumption that the dust - to - gas mass ratio is @xmath84 .",
    "the images show that the ionized gas distribution is not spherical and around the corrugated edge of the @xmath1 region there are many neutral clumps and fingers of gas .",
    "this is a consequence of the @xmath1 region evolving in a clumpy neutral medium .",
    "the fingers and clumps at the edge of the @xmath1 region are the remnants of denser regions in the initial turbulent cloud .",
    "we can also see that the different ions are important in different regions of the photoionized gas .",
    "the [ @xmath2@xmath83 ( blue ) emission is strongest closer to the photoionizing source , while the [ @xmath24@xmath82 ( red ) emission is most prominent around the edge of the @xmath1 region and the h@xmath23 is distributed throughout the nebula .",
    "although not shown in figure  [ fig : hiiimages ] , we also calculate the [ @xmath4@xmath85 emission , which is important only around the edge of the @xmath1 region in the vicinity of the ionization front .",
    "this is consistent with the phenomenon of ionization stratification .",
    "the neutral clumps and fingers around the edge of the @xmath1 region are the source of photoevaporated flows , which flow away from the ionization front into the @xmath1 region .",
    "these flows are mildly supersonic and can reach velocities of up to two or three times the sound speed in the ionized gas .",
    "they shock against each other in the interior of the @xmath1 region .",
    "neutral clumps inside the @xmath1 region are accelerated outwards by the rocket effect in the opposite direction to the photoevaporated material flowing off their ionized skins . in figure",
    "[ fig : hiiimages ] these photoevaporated flows can be discerned as shadowy regions ahead of the convex bright cusps that mark the position of the ionization front . as the photoevaporated gas flows away from the ionization front , the density drops in the diverging flow and",
    "this is why the flows appear darker than the surrounding photoionized gas .",
    "these colliding photoevaporated flows are responsible for the velocity dispersion of the ionized gas , which we show in figure  [ fig : veldisp ] .",
    "this figure shows both the mass - weighted velocity dispersion of the ionized gas and the volume - weighted velocity dispersion . at early times",
    "( @xmath86  yrs ) the volume - weighted velocity dispersion is higher than that of the mass - weighted velocity dispersion .",
    "this is because the @xmath1 region breaks out of the dense clump where it is formed after about 50,000  yrs and a low - density , relatively high velocity champagne flow results .",
    "after about 100,000  yrs , the main ionization front has just about caught up and thereafter the two different velocity dispersions show the same behaviour , remaining roughly constant with @xmath87  km  s@xmath15 . in figure  [",

    "velocity for the analytical expansion @xcite in a uniform medium , where the gas velocity behind the ionization front is one half that of the ionization front and the internal velocities are linear with radius . in this case , the velocity dispersion falls steadily as a function of time , and after 100,000  yrs is less than 2  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "the differences between the velocity dispersions in the numerical and analytic cases are mainly due to the interaction of the photoevaporated flows produced in the simulations described above . in the analytic expansion ,",
    "the velocities are radial away from the central source . in the clumpy medium , the photoevaporated flows lead to large non - radial velocities , which increase the velocity dispersion in the photionized region .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : veldisp ] also shows that the mass - weighted mean radial velocity peaks just before 200,000  yrs at about 7  km  s@xmath15 and thereafter falls off .",

    "at times later than 150,000  years , our second - order structure function results for the h@xmath23 and [ @xmath2@xmath35007 emission - line velocity centroids strongly suggest the presence of turbulence with an inertial range between 1  pc and the numerical dissipation scale of about 8 cells ( equivalent to 0.0625  pc ) .",
    "the [ @xmath24@xmath36584 and [ @xmath4@xmath36716 structure function results also suggest turbulence , with a smaller upper limit to the inertial range , which is consistent with these ions being confined to relatively thin layers near the ionization front . however , it is difficult to characterize this turbulence since the slope of the structure function for a given emission line varies with time in an unpredictable manner and also depends on the line of sight .",
    "although the results for the @xmath43-axis line of sight suggest an increase in slope with time , an examination of the distributions of the velocity centroids ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] ) shows that this is due to a champagne - type flow in that direction , and other lines of sight do not show a definite trend with time .",
    "different emission lines originate in different volumes of ionized gas , and this is reflected in the different slopes for the structure functions from different emitters .",
    "the h@xmath23 line is produced throughout the volume and is brightest close to the ionization front around the bright edges of the photoionized gas .",
    "there is therefore a wide range of densities associated with the h@xmath23-emitting gas .",
    "the emissivity of the h@xmath23 recombination line depends on the square of the density and only weakly on the temperature in the photoionized gas ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". indeed , the gradients of the 3d power spectra of the h@xmath23 emissivity and the square of the density are essentially the same . on the other hand , the emissivity of the [ @xmath2@xmath35007 collisional line depends more strongly on temperature .",
    "this line originates in the interior of the @xmath1 region , where the density is more uniform but weak shocks due to the collision of photoevaporated flows cause fluctuations in the temperature .",
    "a more uniform density distribution corresponds to a steeper density power spectrum and , indeed , the structure functions , 2d velocity channel power spectra , and 3d power spectrum of the [ @xmath2@xmath35007 line are all steeper than those for the h@xmath23 recombination line .    the stellar parameters for the simulations presented in this work correspond to a relatively hot ( 37,500  k ) o7 star . for these parameters ,",
    "the [ @xmath24@xmath36584 and [ @xmath4@xmath36716 collisionally ionized lines come from regions close to the ionization front , where the density variations are strong , and this is reflected in the less steep structure function and 2d velocity channel power spectra gradients . in particular , the [ @xmath4 emission will come from very close to the ionization front where the acceleration of the ionized gas is strongest , and as a result the structure function and 2d velocity channel power - spectra gradients are shallowest for this line .",
    "other stellar parameters , e.g. , a cooler b0 star or a much hotter white dwarf , would produce photoionized regions with different ionization stratifications .",
    "figure  [ fig : ps ] shows that the power spectra of physical quantities are very well approximated by power laws over the range from @xmath100 to 32 ( scales of 1  pc to 0.125  pc ) .",
    "in particular , the ionized gas velocity shows a power - law slope of @xmath122 once the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "this is significantly shallower than the kolmogorov ( @xmath123 ) or burgers ( @xmath36 ) value , indicating more velocity structure at small scales than would be seen in a simple turbulent cascade of energy injected at the largest scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the turbulent velocity dispersion is relatively insensitive to scale , varying as @xmath124 .",
    "one possible reason for the shallow velocity power spectrum may be that energy is injected over a variety of scales , corresponding to the different sizes of clumps and filaments responsible for the photoevaporated flows in the simulated @xmath1 regions . moreover , the energy injection will vary with time due to the global expansion of the @xmath1 region , which moves the sources of the photoevaporated flows generally outwards , and the destruction of the clumps and filaments as they are eroded by the ionizing radiation .",
    "the density power spectrum has a very similar slope to that of the velocity : @xmath122 , but of greater relevance are the slopes of the emissivities of the different emission lines , which are @xmath125 for [",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath126 for @xmath127 , @xmath128 for [ @xmath24 , and @xmath129 for [ @xmath4 .",
    "these span the critical value of @xmath130 that divides `` steep '' from `` shallow '' power spectra .",
    "[ @xmath2 has a steep slope , indicating that large - scale fluctuations dominate , while [ @xmath24 and [ @xmath4 have shallow slopes , indicating that small - scale fluctuations dominate .",
    "the @xmath127 slope is very close to the critical value , indicating roughly equal contributions from fluctuations on all size - scales .",
    "it is interesting to study the question of whether the known power - law indices of the velocity and emissivity power spectra in our simulations can in practice be recovered from observational diagnostics .",
    "if this is not the case for a given diagnostic , then it would call into question its utility for studying real @xmath1 regions . in particular , we will concentrate on two commonly used diagnostics : the second - order structure function of the line velocity centroids , and the power spectra of the surface brightness in isovelocity channel maps ( velocity channel analysis ) .",
    "the structure function of the velocity centroids is an observationally attractive diagnostic because it is relatively immune to the effects of thermal broadening and poor spectral resolution , so long as sufficiently high signal - to - noise spectra are used .",
    "however , it has the disadvantage that relating the observed slope to the 3-dimensional velocity statistics depends on the geometry of the emitting region , see ",
    "[ subsec : projsmooth ] . for transverse separations larger than the characteristic line - of - sight depth of the emitting gas",
    ", the two - dimensional gradient should be equal to the three - dimensional one : @xmath131 whereas at smaller separations than this , projection smoothing , as described above , means that the two - dimensional gradient is steeper : @xmath132 based on our simulation s velocity power spectrum index at late times of @xmath133 ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : ps ] and [ fig : psevol ] ) , the structure function slope should be @xmath134 in the large - scale limit and @xmath135 in the small - scale limit .    in fact , all of the measured slopes lie between these two limits , with a systematically increasing value from low to high - ionization lines : @xmath136 } ) = 0.33 \\pm 0.02 $ ] , @xmath137 } ) = 0.49 \\pm 0.03 $ ] , @xmath138 , @xmath139 } ) = 0.74 \\pm 0.04 $ ] , where the averages were performed for @xmath140  years .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with expectations because the emission from lower - ionization lines is confined to thin layers near the ionization front , whereas higher ionization emission is more distributed over the volume and therefore subject to greater projection smoothing .",
    "if the line - of - sight depth were constant over the face of the @xmath1 region , then the structure function would show a break at a scale equal to that depth , but in reality the depth varies from point to point , so there will not be a sharp break .",
    "instead , the structure function is expected to show negative curvature , with the gradient gradually decreasing as one passes from smaller to larger scales .",
    "a small such effect is seen in the structure functions derived from our simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfunc ] to [ fig : sfuncyz ] ) : the fit to a power law is generally not so good as in the case of the power spectra , with negative residuals at both ends of the fitted range , indicative of a negative curvature . that the observed effect is so small is probably due to the fact that the distribution of line - of - sight depths strongly overlaps with the limited dynamic range in separations available from our simulations , bounded at small scales by numerical dissipation , and at large scales by the size of the ionized region .",
    "it is disappointing that none of the measured slopes reach either of the limiting cases discussed above .",
    "all that can be deduced from the structure function is that @xmath141})$ ] and @xmath142})$ ] , which implies @xmath143 to @xmath144 .",
    "although this is a rather wide range of allowed velocity power spectrum slopes , it does serve to clearly rule out the kolmogorov value of @xmath145 . furthermore",
    ", the `` true '' value of @xmath146 lies close to the middle of the allowed range .",
    "a further proviso to the use of the structure function is that systematic anisotropic flows can affect the measured slopes when the viewing angle is along the direction of the flow .",
    "such an effect is seen at later times for our simulation when viewed along the @xmath43-axis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfunc ] ) .",
    "in this case , the structure function tends to steepen at the large - scale end of our fitting range , producing a positive curvature , which is opposite to the more typical case of negative curvature discussed above .",
    "such cases may also be identified by the presence of a significant skew in the pdf of the line - of - sight velocity ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : histogram ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sf - vs - n ] illustrates these points by graphing the correlation between the structure function slope @xmath106 and the slope @xmath102 of the underlying 3d velocity fluctuations .",
    "the theoretical relation is shown by black diagonal lines , both with ( continuous line ) and without ( dashed line ) projection smoothing .",
    "it is apparent that a large part of the variation in @xmath106 is not driven by changes in @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , @xmath106 shows a larger or equal variation in the latter stages of evolution , when @xmath102 is approximately constant , than it does in the earlier stages , when @xmath102 is varying .",
    "note that the additional complication identified by @xcite , whereby correlations between density and velocity fluctuations affect the translation between @xmath106 and @xmath102 , is likely of minor importance in our case .",
    "@xcite show that this is most important for high mach number turbulence , where @xmath147 , whereas the transonic turbulence inside our simulated @xmath1 regions produces more modest density contrasts .",
    "figure  [ fig : vca - thin - vs - n ] shows the correlations between the slope of the velocity fluctuation power spectrum and the vca slopes found in   [ sssec : vca ] above ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vcatrends ] ) .",
    "the theoretical procedure @xcite for deriving one from the other is slightly different , depending on whether the power spectrum of the emissivity fluctuations is `` steep '' or `` shallow '' ( see   [ sec : stats - vca ] above ) . in the steep case , which applies to [ @xmath2 in our simulation ,",
    "the slope of the average power spectrum of the brightness maps in the thin isovelocity channels is given by @xmath148 , where @xmath149 for our simulation .",
    "the derived value from the [ @xmath2 thin channel maps for @xmath121 is @xmath150 , which compares well with the value @xmath151 that is implied by the simulation s value of @xmath102 .    in the shallow case , it is the difference in slope between the thin and thick slices that is predicted to depend on the velocity fluctuations : @xmath152 .",
    "the derived values are @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath155 for @xmath127 , [ @xmath24 , and [ @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these also compare tolerably well with the value of @xmath156 that is implied by the simulation s value of @xmath102 .",
    "note , however , that the large doppler width of the @xmath127 line means that the thin velocity slices are not useful in this case , since the thick and thin slices have identical slopes .",
    "the fact that this agrees with the theoretical prediction is merely a coincidence , due to our velocity spectrum having a slope that is close to @xmath157 . for the lines from heavier ions , [ @xmath2 , [ @xmath24 and [ @xmath4 , the difference between the thin and thick velocity slices is not erased by thermal broadening , but in these three cases there is a consistent difference of @xmath158 between the measured vca slope and the theoretically expected one .",
    "the origin of this difference is unclear , but it is small enough that it is not a significant impediment to the application of the vca method .",
    "the slopes of the power spectra of the thick slices themselves , which are simply the velocity - integrated surface brightness images are predicted @xcite to be equal to the slopes of the 3d power spectra of their respective emissivities .",
    "the comparison between these two quantities is shown in figure  [ fig : vca - thick - vs - n ] , from which it is clear that only in the case of [ @xmath2 are the two slopes equal . in the case of the other lines ,",
    "@xmath120 is shallower than the emissivity s spectral index @xmath102 by 0.36 , 0.19 , 0.61 for @xmath127 , [ @xmath24 , and [ @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the increasingly `` sheet - like '' morphology of the emission in the lower ionization lines . as shown in   4.1 of @xcite ,",
    "one should see a transition from @xmath159 to the shallower slope @xmath160 at transverse scales larger than the line - of - sight depth of the emitting region .",
    "non - thermal linewidths in @xmath1 regions have been interpreted as evidence for turbulence in the photoionized gas .",
    "galactic @xmath1 regions generally exhibit subsonic turbulent widths , while giant extragalactic @xmath1 regions can have supersonic turbulent motions .",
    "the majority of observational studies consider only the h@xmath23 line , but @xcite and examine the components of the [ @xmath2@xmath35007 line in the orion nebula , m42 , while @xcite and @xcite investigate the kinematics of the [ siii ] and [ oi ] lines of this same object .",
    "the giant extragalactic @xmath1 region ngc-595 was studied by who analyzed the h@xmath23 , [ @xmath2 and [ @xmath4 kinematics .",
    "the heavier ions have the advantage that their emission lines have low thermal broadening compared to the h@xmath23 line .",
    "observational studies of the spatial scales of velocity fluctuations have mostly focused on the structure function of velocity centroids .",
    "the results are rather disparate , partly because the methodology varies considerably between different studies .",
    "for instance , some authors attempt to filter out `` ordered '' large - scale motions before analysing the fluctuations @xcite , whereas others analyse the unfiltered observations @xcite .",
    "also , in some cases multiple gaussian velocity components are fitted to the line profiles @xcite , which are then assigned to a small number of velocity `` systems '' that are each analysed separately , whereas in most studies the mean velocity of the entire line profile is used .    despite these differences ,",
    "there are interesting commonalities in the results : a rising structure function with @xmath161@xmath162 is nearly always found at the smallest scales , which transitions to a flat structure function with @xmath163 at larger scales . however , the scale at which the transition occurs varies enormously from object to object , from @xmath164@xmath165  pc in compact ( @xmath166 to 5  pc ) galactic @xmath1 regions @xcite , up to 50  pc in giant ( @xmath167  pc ) extragalactic regions @xcite .",
    "we comment that the sound - crossing time for a region of size 50  pc is about 5  myr , roughly the same as the estimated age of the ngc  595 nebula @xcite . for the full extent of ngc  595 ,",
    "the sound crossing time is about 40  myr .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the turbulence in such large regions is in a statistically steady state unless it is highly supersonic .",
    "indeed , @xcite suggest that in the case of large extragalactic @xmath1 regions , the large linewidths could be due to multiple velocity components , that is , parts of the @xmath1 region with separation greater than the distance a sound wave could travel within the current lifetime of the object are kinematically distinct .",
    "such giant @xmath1 regions show velocity centroid dispersions of @xmath168 on the largest scales , which is several times larger than is seen in compact single - star regions or in our simulations .",
    "we will therefore not consider them further since they are governed by additional physical processes , such as powerful stellar winds and the cluster gravitational potential , which are beyond the scope of the current paper .",
    "the explanations that have been offered for the break in the structure function slope are also varied . in the case of compact @xmath1 regions ,",
    "it is often taken to indicate the characteristic line - of - sight depth of the emission zone @xcite , with projection smoothing steepening the slope at the smaller separations ( see   [ subsec : projsmooth ] above ) .",
    "if that were the case , then the correct three - dimensional structure function slope is the flat one : @xmath169 , corresponding to a velocity power spectrum slope of @xmath130",
    ". this interpretation would be broadly consistent with our simulation results , which show a very similar velocity power spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ps ] ) .",
    "however , our simulated structure functions rarely show a clear break in the same way as the observations do , although they do show a slight negative curvature in many cases .",
    "this is probably because of the very limited useful dynamic range , roughly a factor of 10 , that the simulations allow between the small scales that are affected by numerical diffusion and the large scales , that are affected by systematic flows , anisotropies , and edge - effects .",
    "an alternative explanation for the observed break in the structure function is that it represents the scale of the largest turbulent eddies @xcite and that the fluctuations at larger scales are simply uncorrelated . in such a picture",
    "it would still be necessary to postulate a velocity spectrum considerably shallower than kolmogorov in order to explain the small - scale slope .",
    "based on the discussion of our simulation results above (   [ sssec : vca2 ] ) , it seems that velocity channel analysis would be a very useful complement to the structure function , since it is less affected by uncertainties in projection smoothing and gives a more consistent result between different emission lines ( at least , for our simulations ) .    in a forthcoming paper",
    ", we will present such an analysis of recent high - resolution echelle spectroscopy of multiple emission lines in the orion nebula @xcite .",
    "1 .   we have investigated the statistics of fluctuations in physical conditions within a radiation - hydrodynamic simulation of the evolution of an @xmath1 region inside a highly inhomogeneous molecular cloud .",
    "we find that steady - state turbulence , corresponding to time - independent profiles of the 3d power spectra , is only established after about 1.5 sound - crossing times of the @xmath1 region . in these simulations",
    ", this corresponds to about 200,000 years (   [ sssec : pspec ] ) .",
    "we find a power - law behaviour for the 3d power spectra in the range from about 1 pc down to 0.125 pc , equivalent to 16 computational cells .",
    "the larger scale can be interpreted as the size of the largest photoevaporated flows , while the smaller scale is about twice the numerical dissipation scale .",
    "the power - spectrum slopes of the velocity and density fluctuations are very similar and always lie in the range @xmath170 .",
    "this is significantly shallower than the slope predicted for the inertial range of either incompressible or compressible turbulence ( @xmath171 to @xmath172 ) .",
    "this suggests that turbulent driving is occuring over all scales in our simulation , unlike the case of classical turbulence where energy is injected only at the largest scales .",
    "the power - spectrum slopes of the emissivities of optical lines are even shallower , increasingly so for lower ionization lines , indicating that the smallest scale fluctuations are dominant (   [ sssec : ips ] ) .",
    "3 .   we investigate in detail the utility of observational diagnostics for inferring the power spectra of emissivity and velocity fluctuations in our simulation .",
    "we find that the traditional velocity centroid structure function technique gives ambivalent results because of the effects of projection smoothing , combined with the fact that the effective line - of - sight depth of the emitting gas does not have a single well - defined value .",
    "in addition , the presence of anisotropic motions such as champagne flows can yield misleading structure function slopes when the simulation is viewed from certain directions (   [ sssec : strfunc ] ) .",
    "4 .   the more recently developed technique of velocity channel analysis is found to offer a more robust diagnostic of the three - dimensional velocity statistics of our simulation .",

    "for the upper limit , we examined the projected emission maps and calculated the area occupied by the pixels having greater than the mean intensity .",
    "this method is independent of the resolution of the image and could equally be applied to images obtained from observations .",
    "we then took the radius of the circle having the same area to be the upper limit for the least - squares fit .",
    "this procedure appears to work very well , as can be seen in figures  [ fig : sfunc ] and [ fig : sfuncyz ] .",
    "if a different line of sight is chosen , the radius of this circle will be different and needs to be calculated self - consistently for every projection .",
    "note that the inertial range for each combination of line and view tends to become broader with time due to the expansion of the @xmath1 region . at the latest time , 300,000  yrs , both the h@xmath23 and",
    "[ @xmath2@xmath105 structure functions appear to develop a break , which would be better fit by two power laws , one below a scale of about 0.3  pc and a steeper one for larger scales .",
    "however , we have fit just a single power law to both of these cases .",
    "we speculate that this apparent break in the power law at late times could be due to energy injection at size scales associated with the photoevaporated flows emanating from the ubiquitous clumps and filaments seen in the emission - line images ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : hiiimages ] ) .    an alternative criterion for the upper limit",
    "was used by @xcite who used the theoretical result for isotropic , homogeneous turbulence that decorrelation of the second - order structure function occurs when the auto - correlation function changes sign from positive to negative . in the theory",
    ", this corresponds to the scale for which the second - order structure function is equal to 2 . figure  [ fig : sfauto ] shows the structure function and auto - correlation function obtained from our simulations at times 150,000  yrs and 250,000  yrs for the [ @xmath2@xmath83 emission line velocity centroids projected onto the @xmath173-plane .",
    "the other emission lines and viewing directions give very similar results . from this figure",
    ", we see that at early times , when the structure function does indeed rise above 2 , this corresponds approximately to the length scale at which the auto - correlation function changes sign .",
    "however , at later times the auto - correlation function changes sign at a length scale much smaller than the size of the computational box but the structure function remains less than 2 .",
    "this suggests that the assumptions of the simple theory ( isotropic , homogeneous turbulence ) do not apply to the emission - line velocity centroids obtained from our simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : sfauto ] also indicates the fitting range suggested by the procedure described earlier . at early times , our procedure results in a slightly larger upper length scale for the power - law fit than using the zero point of the auto - correlation function . at later times , the two more - or - less coincide and this is true for all the emission lines , viewing angles and times we have examined . since there is no clear reason to prefer the auto - correlation approach , we will use our computationally simpler procedure to determine the upper length scale for the power - law fit .",
    "figures  [ fig : vca ] to  [ fig : vcayz ] show the power spectra resulting from the velocity channel analysis ( see   [ sec : stats - vca ] ) .",
    "each of the three figures is for a different viewing direction and shows the four emission lines at four different times . for each combination of line and time",
    ", there are two panels : an upper panel without including thermal doppler broadening and a lower panel with the broadening effects included . in each graph , two power spectra are plotted : one representing a very thick velocity slice ( i.e. , encompassing all the emission ) and the other averaged over thin velocity slices of width @xmath174  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "also shown on each panel are the power - law indices obtained from least - squares power - law fits to the thin ( @xmath119 ) and very thick slice ( @xmath120 ) spectra and the range in wavenumber over which the fit is calculated .",
    "this wavenumber range corresponds to the length - scale range used for the structure function fits ( see   [ sssec : s2func ] ) .",
    "the very thick velocity slice is equivalent to the total intensity along the line of sight and its power spectrum does not vary with the addition of thermal broadening .",
    "it is clear that the thermal broadening has a large effect on the vca of the h@xmath23 line , effectively erasing the difference in slope between the thin and thick slices . for photoionized gas at @xmath175  k",
    ", the fwhm of the h@xmath23 line is @xmath176  km  s@xmath15 , while that of an oxygen line is a quarter of this , @xmath177  km  s@xmath15 .",
    "indeed , the heavier ions are less affected by thermal broadening , but a slight steepening of the thin - slice power spectra can still be seen , amounting to a reduction in @xmath119 of @xmath178 .    for the thermally broadened case , the variation with time of the slopes of these fits , @xmath120 for the thick slices and @xmath119 for the thin slices , is shown in fig  [ fig : vcatrends ] and discussed in   [ sssec : vca ] ."
