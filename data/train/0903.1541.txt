    "assuming a uniform distribution of matter on large scales , the observed data of high - redshift type ia supernovae(snia)@xcite point to @xmath2-dominated flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models .",
    "the darkness of the snia is reduced to accelerating expansion of the universe due to a positive @xmath2 term .",
    "these @xmath2-dominated frw models are consistent also with the observed data of temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation@xcite , except for the low - multipole components@xcite .",
    "moreover the observed correlation between the cmb and large - scale structure supports these @xmath2-dominated models , which can generate anisotropies due to the first - order(linear ) isw effect@xcite .    on the other hand , alternative inhomogeneous models that can explain the snia data without introducing a cosmological constant @xmath2 have been independently proposed by c@xmath5l@xmath6rier@xcite , goodwin et al.@xcite and tomita@xcite and subsequently studied by several authors@xcite .",
    "it turned out that some inhomogeneous cosmological models with an inner large - scale underdense region ( which we called _ a local void _ in our previous works ) with a small hubble constant ( @xmath7 ) in the outer flat region can also explain the cmb data@xcite as well as the snia data . in these models ,",
    "the cosmological copernican principle is violated since we need to live near the center of an underdense region .",
    "however , recent observational studies such as the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite , the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect either from clusters @xcite or reionized regions@xcite put stringent constraints on these anti - copernican models . as a result , models with a local void on 300 mpc scales seem to be ruled out . at the moment , we need to consider inhomogeneous models with a local void on gpc scales so that the constraints from bao at epochs of @xmath8 may be avoided .",
    "recently several gpc void models have been studied by clifton et al.@xcite and garca - bellido and haugb@xmath9lle@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the isw effect in flat frw models with an inner underdense region on gpc scales based on previous results@xcite .",
    "then we compare it with the isw effect in the concordant flat frw model with a cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "as we shall show , the isw effect will be an excellent discriminator between our anti - copernican models and the standard concordant copernican model . in  2 , we present our inhomogeneous cosmological model with inner underdense regions and in  3 we derive analytic formulae for calculating the isw effect in the inner and outer regions and we discuss the property of temperature anisotropy due to the isw effect in our models and the concordant model .  4 is dedicated to concluding remarks . in",
    "what follows , we use the units of @xmath10 . for spatial coordinates",
    ", we use latin subscripts running from 1 to 3 .",
    "our inhomogeneous anti - copernican models without a cosmological constant @xmath2 consist of two inner underdense regions ( i and ii ) and an outer flat region ( iii ) .",
    "the former regions are described by negatively curved frw models ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) and the outer region is by the einstein - de sitter model ( eds)(@xmath13 ) . here in these regions we use homogeneous models locally because the isw effect can be treated only in homogeneous models at present .",
    "we assume that these regions are connected by two infinitesimally thin walls at redshifts @xmath0 and @xmath14 corresponding to the boundary between i and ii and the boundary between ii and iii , respectively .",
    "the latter redshift value @xmath14 corresponds to a @xmath15 gpc radius of the spherical underdense region .",
    "the hubble constants @xmath16 and @xmath17 in these regions satisfy a relation @xmath18 . here",
    "we consider the following two cases :    @xmath19    where @xmath20 stands for the value necessary for the observed cmb anisotropies in the eds model , @xmath21 in case 2 is the standard value in the local measurement , and the case 1 with smaller @xmath22 and @xmath23 is taken so as to consider a stringent observational condition which is given by the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect@xcite .",
    "if we regard the outer region as the background , the inner region can be interpreted as a local inhomogeneity and has an optical influence on the temperature of cmb radiation .",
    "if the observer is exactly at the center , the influence is isotropic , but if he is off - center , it brings dipole , quadrupole and the other multipole anisotropies .",
    "these anisotropies have already been analyzed and discussed in previous papers@xcite . in what follows ,",

    "we adopt @xmath51 and @xmath52 km / s / mpc .",
    "now we consider growing mode of density perturbations and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect in the inner and outer regions , separately .      the first - order gauge - invariant growing density perturbations @xmath53 and the gauge - invariant potential perturbation ( in the growing mode ) @xmath54@xcite are expressed as @xmath55 with @xmath56 where @xmath53 corresponds to the density perturbations in the comoving synchronous gauge , @xmath57 is equal to the potential perturbations @xmath58 in the longitudinal or poisson gauge , and @xmath59 is the potential function given as an arbitrary function of spatial coordinates .",
    "the expression of @xmath60 was derived from the solution shown by lifshits and khalatinikov@xcite .",

    "so we obtain from eqs.([eq : m1a ] ) and ( [ eq : r1 ] ) @xmath66 the first - order gauge - invariant temperature fluctuation due to the linear isw effect is expressed as @xmath67 in the poisson gauge , where the prime is @xmath68 and @xmath69 is the affine parameter along the light path . @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the emitter s and observer s values at the decoupling and present epochs , respectively .     the matter density contrast for a top - hat type spherical void.,width=302 ]    in this paper we consider a simple spherical top - hat type of compensated density perturbation following our previous paper@xcite , whose spatial size is much smaller than the horizon size . the spatial variation of the density perturbation is schematically shown in fig.[fig : rs2 ] .",
    "we consider the cmb photon paths passing through the center of the spherical perturbation .",

    "the first - order isw effect does not appear and the second - order isw effcet is the lowest one .",

    "[ fig : rs2 ] ) , and the central value of the density perturbation @xmath86 is related to a constant @xmath74 as @xmath87 using eq.([eq : r9 ] ) , the temperature fluctuations are expressed as @xmath88 the temperature fluctuations are negative definite .",
    "they are not exactly observed fluctuations , because their observed values should be the difference from the average value @xmath89 of the sum of the second - order temperature fluctuations which is caused by all possible primordial density perturbations and renormalized into the background temperature .",
    "this average value is derived , taking account of power spectrum of density perturbations , in the procedure shown in a separate paper@xcite .",
    "so the above @xmath90 should be here used to show the order of magnitude of second - order isw effect , but for the perturbations with large amplitudes , the above second - order fluctuations are regarded approximately as observed values , as the mean value can be neglected .",
    "the deformation of the walls brings the complicated perturbations inside the walls and their neighborhoods , as was studied by one of the present authors through the analysis of the junction condition@xcite .",
    "they include not only density perturbations , but also gravitational - wave and rotational perturbations .",
    "gravitational - wave perturbations propagate , but their amplitudes are very small and the contribution to density perturbations is negligible , because of the small coupling between them .",
    "moreover the density and rotational perturbations caused by the perturbed walls do not propagate in the present dust matter models and are constrained in the just neighborhoods of the walls . in the most part of the i ,",
    "ii and iii regions , therefore , we see density perturbations which are independent of the wall motions and were caused primordially due to the common origin .",
    "their amplitudes in the three regions were nearly equal at the early stages , but the present amplitudes became different , because they had different growth rates .",
    "here we neglect the above complicated perturbations inside the walls and in their narrow neighborhoods .",
    "then the three density perturbations @xmath91 and @xmath92 included in the two equations ( [ eq : r6 ] ) and ( [ eq : r10 ] ) are related as follows .",
    "first we assume that @xmath93 and @xmath94 should be equal at early epochs of equal densities with the redshifts @xmath95 and @xmath96 , i.e. @xmath97 , where @xmath98 . the present densities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are related as @xmath101 and @xmath102 . then @xmath95 and @xmath103 are related as @xmath104^{1/3 } =   [ ( \\omega_{i0}/\\omega_{iii0 } ) ( h_{i0}/h_{iii0})^2]^{1/3 } , \\cr ( 1+z_3)/(1+z_2 ) & = & [ \\rho_{ii0}/\\rho_{iii0}]^{1/3 } =    [ ( \\omega_{ii0}/\\omega_{iii0 } ) ( h_{ii0}/h_{iii0})^2]^{1/3}.   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] taking account of the growth rates , we obtain @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    "<S> recent observational data of supernovae indicate that we may live in an underdense region , which challenges the copernican principle . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect is an excellent discriminator between anti - copernican inhomogeneous models and the standard copernican models . as a reference model </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an anti - copernican inhomogeneous model that consists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat einstein - de sitter region . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that these regions are connected by two thin - walls at redshifts @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the inner two regions , the first - order isw effect is dominant and comparable to that in the concordant flat-@xmath2 models . in the outer einstein - de sitter region , </S>",
    "<S> the first - order isw effect vanishes but the second - order isw effect plays a dominant role , while the first - order isw effect is dominant in the flat-@xmath2 models at moderate redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> this difference can discrimate the anti - copernican models from the concordant flat-@xmath2 model . at high redshits , the second - order isw effect is dominant both in our inhomogeneous model and the concordant model . in the outer region , </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the isw effect due to large - scale density perturbations with a present matter density contrast @xmath3 is negligible , while the effect due to small - scale density perturbations ( such as clusters of galaxies , superclusters and voids ) with @xmath4 would generate anisotropies which are larger than those generated by the isw effect in the concordant model . </S>"
