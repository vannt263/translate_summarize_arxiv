    "one of the reasons the continuum random tree of aldous has attracted such great interest is that it connects together a number of diverse areas of probability theory . on one hand",
    ", it appears from discrete probability as the scaling limit of combinatorial graph trees and probabilistic branching processes ; and on the other hand , it is intimately related with a continuous time process , namely the normalised brownian excursion , @xcite .",
    "however , with both of these representations of the continuum random tree , there does not appear to be an obvious description of the structure of the set itself . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the continuum random tree has a recursive description as a random self - similar fractal and show that the set is always homeomorphic to a deterministic subset of the euclidean plane . as an application of this precise description of the random self - similarity of the continuum random tree ,",
    "we deduce results about the spectrum and on - diagonal heat kernel of the natural dirichlet form on the set using techniques developed for random recursive self - similar fractals .    from its graph tree scaling limit description , aldous showed how the continuum random tree has a certain random self - similarity , @xcite . in this article",
    ", we use this result iteratively to label the continuum random tree , @xmath0 , using a shift space over a three letter alphabet .",
    "this enables us to show that there is an isometry from @xmath0 , with its natural metric @xmath1 ( see section [ crtdef ] for a precise definition of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , and section [ decompsec ] for the decomposition of @xmath0 that we apply ) , to a deterministic subset of @xmath3 , @xmath4 say , equipped with a random metric @xmath5 , @xmath6-a.s . , where @xmath6 is the probability measure on the probability space upon which all the random variables of the discussion are defined .",
    "this metric is constructed using random scaling factors in an adaptation of the now well - established techniques of @xcite for building a resistance metric on a post - critically finite self - similar fractal .",
    "we note that on a tree the resistance and geodesic metrics are the same .",
    "furthermore , we show that the isometry in question also links the natural borel probability measures on the spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the relevant measures will be denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively , with @xmath9 arising as the scaling limit of the uniform measures on the graph approximations of @xmath0 ( see @xcite , for example ) , and @xmath10 being the random self - similar measure that is associated with the construction of @xmath5 .",
    "the result that we prove is the following ; full descriptions of @xmath11 are given in section [ selfsimsec ] , and the isometry is defined in section [ isosec ] .",
    "[ first ] there exists a deterministic post - critically finite self - similar dendrite , @xmath4 , equipped with a ( random ) self - similar metric , @xmath5 , and borel probability measure , @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 is equivalent to @xmath12 as a measure - metric space , @xmath6-a.s .",
    "previous analytic work on the continuum random tree in @xcite obtained estimates on the quenched and the annealed heat kernel for the tree .",
    "we can now adapt techniques of @xcite to consider the spectral asymptotics of the tree . as a byproduct we are also able to refine the results on the annealed heat kernel to show the existence of a short time limit for @xmath13 at the root of the tree @xmath14 , where the notation @xmath15 is used to represent expectation under the probability measure @xmath6 .",
    "the natural dirichlet form on @xmath16 may be thought of simply as the electrical energy when we consider @xmath7 as a resistance network .",
    "we shall denote this form by @xmath17 , and its domain @xmath18 , and explain in section [ crtdef ] how it may be constructed using results of @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of the triple @xmath19 are defined to be the numbers @xmath20 which satisfy @xmath21 for some eigenfunction @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue counting function , @xmath23 , is obtained by setting @xmath24 and we prove in section [ specsec ] that this is well - defined and finite for any @xmath25 , @xmath6-a.s . in section",
    "[ specsec ] , we also prove the following result , which shows that asymptotically the mean and @xmath6-a.s .",
    "behaviour of @xmath23 are identical .",
    "[ second ] there exists a deterministic constant @xmath26 such that + ( a ) @xmath27 , as @xmath28 .",
    "+ ( b ) @xmath29 , as @xmath28 , @xmath6-a.s .    to provide some context for this result",
    ", we will now briefly discuss some related work .",
    "for the purposes of brevity , during the remainder of the introduction , we shall use the notation @xmath30 to denote the eigenvalue counting function of whichever problem is being considered .",
    "classically , for the usual laplacian on a bounded domain @xmath31 , weyl s famous theorem tells us that the eigenvalue counting function satisfies @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constant depending only on @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is the lebesgue measure of @xmath36 , see @xcite . as a consequence , in this setting ,",
    "there exists a limit for @xmath37 as @xmath28 . in the case of deterministic p.c.f .",
    "self - similar fractals it is known that @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a periodic function , see @xcite , theorem 4.1.5 .",
    "the generic case has @xmath39 constant but for fractals with a high degree of symmetry , such as the class of nested fractals , ( an example is the sierpinski gasket ) , the function @xmath39 can be proved to be non - constant , and so no limit actually exists for @xmath40 as @xmath28 for these fractals . in the case of random recursive sierpinski gaskets , as studied in @xcite , there are similar results , however the function @xmath39 must be multiplied by a random weight variable , which can be thought of as a measure of the volume of the fractal , and roughly corresponds to the factor @xmath35 in ( [ weyl ] ) . again",
    "the generic case is that the limit of the rescaled counting function exists and , in this setting , there are no known examples of periodic behaviour .",
    "for the continuum random tree , no periodic fluctuations or random weight factors appear ; this is due to the non - lattice distribution of the dirichlet @xmath41 random variables that are used in the self - similar construction , and also the fact that summing the three elements of the triple gives exactly one , @xmath6-a.s .",
    "it is also worth commenting upon the values of the exponent of @xmath20 in the leading order behaviour of @xmath30 in the classical and fractal setting . from weyl",
    "s result for bounded domains in @xmath42 , we see that the limit @xmath43 is precisely @xmath34 , matching the hausdorff dimension of @xmath36 . however , for deterministic and random self - similar fractals , this agreement is not generally the case . for a large class of finitely ramified fractals",
    "it has been proved that @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hausdorff dimension of the fractal in the resistance metric ( see @xcite , theorem 4.2.1 , and @xcite , theorem 1.1 ) . due to its definition from the spectral asymptotics ,",
    "the quantity @xmath46 has become known as the spectral dimension of a ( laplacian on a ) set .",
    "clearly , from the previous theorem , we see that for the continuum random tree @xmath47 .",
    "this result could have been predicted from the self - similar fractal picture of the set given in theorem [ first ] , and ( [ spectraldim ] ) , noting that @xmath48 for the continuum random tree ( see @xcite ) .",
    "observe that to be able to apply the result of @xcite , the equivalence of the resistance and geodesic metrics on trees must be used .",
    "finally , let @xmath49 be the markov process corresponding to @xmath19 and denote by @xmath50 its transition density ; alternatively this is the heat kernel of the laplacian associated with the dirichlet form .",
    "the existence of @xmath51 for @xmath52 was proved in @xcite , where it was also shown that @xmath53 exhibits logarithmic fluctuations globally , and log - logarithmic fluctuations for @xmath9-a.e .",
    "@xmath54 , as @xmath55 .",
    "these fluctuations are caused by variations in the `` thickness '' of the measure @xmath9 over the space , which result in turn from the randomness of the construction .",
    "however , the result of theorem [ second](b ) implies that these fluctuations must even out , when averaged over the entire space . in particular , applying an abelian theorem in the way discussed in remark 5.11 of @xcite , we obtain the following limit result for the trace of the heat semigroup , which we state without proof .",
    "let @xmath56 be the constant of theorem [ second ] , and @xmath57 be the standard gamma function , then + ( a ) @xmath58 ( b ) @xmath6-a.s . , @xmath59    another corollary , which follows from the invariance under random re - rooting of the continuum random tree , @xcite , allows us to deduce from part ( a ) of this corollary the following limit for the annealed heat kernel at @xmath14 , the root of @xmath0 ( see section [ crtdef ] for a definition ) .",
    "this tightens the result obtained in @xcite , proposition 1.7 for the annealed heat kernel .",
    "let @xmath56 be the constant of theorem [ second ] , and @xmath57 be the standard gamma function , then @xmath60    an outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the continuum random tree and give the natural dirichlet form associated with the tree . in section 3",
    "we use the decomposition of aldous to give a description of the tree via a sequence space .",
    "once we have established this we can map the continuum random tree into a post - critically finite self - similar tree with a random metric .",
    "finally we show that the map ensures that the two sets are equivalent as metric measure spaces .",
    "once we have the picture as a self - similar set with a random metric it is straightforward to deduce a decomposition of the dirichlet form and from this a natural scaling in the eigenvalues .",
    "this leads to our results on the spectrum , and via an abelian theorem , to results on the trace of the heat semigroup .",
    "the connection between trees and excursions is an area that has been of much recent interest . in this section ,",
    "we provide a brief introduction to this link , a definition of the continuum random tree , and also describe how to construct the natural dirichlet form on this set .",
    "we begin by defining the space of excursions , @xmath61 , to be the set of continuous functions @xmath62 for which there exists a @xmath63 such that @xmath64 if and only if @xmath65 . given a function @xmath66",

    "we then use the equivalence @xmath70 to define @xmath71/\\sim$ ] . denoting by @xmath72 $ ] the equivalence class containing @xmath73 , it is elementary ( see @xcite , section 2 ) to check that @xmath74,[t]):=d_f(s , t)$ ] defines a metric on @xmath75 , and",
    "also that @xmath75 is a _ dendrite _ , which is taken to mean a path - wise connected hausdorff space containing no subset homeomorphic to the circle .",
    "furthermore , the metric @xmath76 is a shortest path metric on @xmath75 , which means that it is additive along the paths of @xmath75 .",
    "the _ root _ of the tree @xmath75 is defined to be the equivalence class @xmath77 $ ] , and is denoted by @xmath78 .",
    "a natural volume measure to impose upon @xmath75 is the projection of lebesgue measure on @xmath67 $ ] . in particular , for open @xmath79 , let @xmath80:\\:[t]\\in a\\}\\right),\\ ] ] where , throughout this article , @xmath81 is the usual 1-dimensional lebesgue measure .",
    "this defines a borel measure on @xmath82 , with total mass equal to @xmath83 .",
    "we are now able to define the _ continuum random tree _ as the random dendrite that we get when the function @xmath84 is chosen according to the law of a suitably scaled brownian excursion .",
    "more precisely , we shall assume that there exists an underlying probability space , with probability measure @xmath6 , upon which is defined a process @xmath85 which has the law of the normalised brownian excursion , where , throughout this article `` normalised '' is taken to mean `` scaled to return to the origin for the first time at time 1 '' . in keeping with the notation used so far in this section",
    ", the measure - metric space of interest should be written @xmath86 , the distance on @xmath87 $ ] , defined at ( [ distance ] ) , @xmath88 , and the root , @xmath89 .",
    "however , we shall omit the subscripts @xmath90 with the understanding that we are discussing the continuum random tree in this case .",
    "we note that @xmath91 , @xmath6-a.s .",
    ", and so @xmath87=[0,1]$ ] and @xmath9 is a probability measure on @xmath0 , @xmath6-a.s . moreover , that @xmath9 is non - atomic is readily checked using simple path properties of @xmath90 .",
    "note that our definition differs slightly from the aldous continuum random tree , which is based on the random function @xmath92 . since this extra factor only has the effect of increasing distances by a factor of 2 , our results are readily adapted to apply to aldous tree .",
    "a further observation that will be useful to us is that between any three points of a dendrite there is a unique branch - point .",
    "we shall denote the branch - point of @xmath93 by @xmath94 , which is the unique point in @xmath0 lying on the arcs between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath97 and @xmath95 .",
    "finally , we note that it is easy to check the conditions of @xcite , theorem 5.4 to deduce that it is possible to build a natural dirichlet form on the continuum random tree .",
    "there exists a local regular dirichlet form @xmath98 on @xmath16 , which is associated with the metric @xmath2 through , for every @xmath99 , @xmath100    this final property means that the metric @xmath2 is indeed the resistance metric associated with @xmath98",
    ". it will be the eigenvalue counting function defined from @xmath101 as at ( [ ecf ] ) for which we deduce asymptotic results in this article .",
    "to make precise the decomposition of the continuum random tree that we shall apply , we use the excursion description of the set introduced in the previous section .",
    "this allows us to prove rigorously the independence properties that are important to our argument .",
    "however , it may not be immediately obvious exactly what the excursion picture is telling us about the continuum random tree , and so , after lemma [ aldousdecomp ] , we present a more heuristic discussion of the procedure we use in terms of the related dendrites .    the initial object of consideration is a triple @xmath102 , where @xmath90 is the normalised brownian excursion , and @xmath61 and @xmath103 are independent @xmath104 $ ] random variables , independent of @xmath90 . from this triple it is possible to define three independent brownian excursions .",
    "the following decomposition is rather awkward to write down , but is made clearer by figure [ bed ] .",

    "it is @xmath6-a.s .",

    "describing the result in terms of the corresponding trees gives a much clearer picture of what the above decomposition does .",

    "the previous result tells us precisely that @xmath149 , @xmath143 , are three independent copies of @xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath150 for @xmath143 , respectively , then @xmath151 is a @xmath144-random variable in @xmath145 .",
    "finally , all these quantities are independent of the masses @xmath152 , which form a dirichlet @xmath41 triple .",
    "although it is possible to deal with the subtrees directly using conditional definitions of the random variables to decompose the continuum random tree in this way , the excursion description allows us to keep track of exactly what is independent more easily , and it is to this setting that we return .",
    "however , we shall not completely neglect the tree description of the algorithm we now introduce , and a summary in this vein appears after proposition [ decompprop ] .",

    "now , suppose we are given an independent collection @xmath174 , where @xmath90 is a normalised brownian excursion , @xmath61 is @xmath104 $ ] , and @xmath175 is a family of independent @xmath104 $ ] random variables . set @xmath176 .",

    "furthermore , lemma [ aldousdecomp ] implies that each triple of the form @xmath184 has the dirichlet @xmath41 distribution .",
    "subsequently we will also be interested in the collection @xmath185 , where for each @xmath169 , we define @xmath186 and will write @xmath187 to represent the product @xmath188 , where @xmath189 .",
    "the reason for considering such families is that , in our decomposition of the continuum random tree , @xmath179 and @xmath185 represent the mass and length scaling factors respectively .    by viewing the inductive procedure for decomposing excursions as the repeated splitting of trees in the way described after lemma [ aldousdecomp ] , it is possible to use the above algorithm to break the continuum random tree into smaller components , with the subtrees in the @xmath34th level of construction being described by the excursions @xmath190 .",

    "note that the description of @xmath5 in proposition [ rdescrp ] easily leads to the well known inequality @xmath527 to represent the corresponding @xmath528 norm ) , we find that , for @xmath427 , @xmath529 , @xmath530 and so , @xmath6-a.s .",
    ", @xmath531 , for some constant @xmath532 . combining this inequality with ( [ resineq ] )",
    ", we can imitate the argument of @xcite , lemma 5.4 , to deduce that the natural inclusion map from @xmath533 to @xmath364 is a compact operator .",
    "it follows that the dirichlet and neumann spectra of @xmath522 are discrete , and so the associated eigenvalue counting functions , @xmath534 and @xmath535 , are well - defined and finite for all @xmath25 .    from the definitions in the previous paragraph",
    ", we can easily see that @xmath536 , @xmath6-a.s .",
    ", and so , using the terminology introduced above , the eigenvalues of @xmath537 may be thought of as neumann eigenvalues .",
    "of course , this definition does not provide any justification for using the name neumann , so we will now give an explanation of why it is sensible to do so .",
    "since we will not actually apply this interpretation , we only sketch the relevant results .",
    "analogously to @xcite , definition 3.7.1 , let @xmath538 be the collection of functions @xmath539 such that there exists a function @xmath540 satisfying @xmath541 where @xmath542 is the discrete laplacian on @xmath336 associated with @xmath337 , @xmath543 , and @xmath544 is the unique harmonic extension ( with respect to @xmath363 ) of @xmath545 from @xmath336 to @xmath4 . for a function",
    "@xmath546 satisfying ( [ limit ] ) , we write @xmath547 , so that @xmath155 is essentially the limit operator of the rescaled discrete laplacians @xmath542 . furthermore , for @xmath548",
    ", we can also define a function , @xmath549 say , with domain @xmath550 , which represents the neumann derivative on the boundary of @xmath4 ( similarly to @xcite , definition 3.7.6 ) by setting @xmath551 . by using a green s function argument as in the proof of @xcite , theorem 3.7.9 , it is possible to deduce that the friedrichs extension of @xmath155 on @xmath552 is precisely @xmath553 , the laplacian associated with @xmath554 .",
    "similarly , the friedrichs extension of @xmath155 on @xmath555 is @xmath556 , the laplacian associated with @xmath557 .",
    "note that the construction of the relevant green s function may be accomplished more easily than in @xcite by , instead of imitating the analytic definition used there , applying a probabilistic definition , with @xmath558 being the green s kernel for the markov process associated with @xmath559 killed on hitting @xmath550 ( the existence of which follows from an argument similar to that used in @xcite , proposition 4.2 ) .    applying the relationships between the various operators introduced in the previous paragraph ( and also the continuity of the green s function ) , we are able to emulate the argument of @xcite , proposition 4.1.2 , to deduce that the eigenvalues of @xmath554 are precisely the solutions to @xmath560 for some eigenfunction @xmath561 . furthermore , the eigenvalues of @xmath562 are precisely the solutions to @xmath563 for some eigenfunction @xmath561 . from these characterisations , it is clear that the dirichlet and neumann eigenvalues of @xmath564 that we have defined are exactly the eigenvalues of @xmath565 with the usual dirichlet ( zero function on boundary ) and neumann ( zero derivative on boundary ) boundary conditions respectively , where the analytic boundary of @xmath4 is taken to be @xmath550 .    by mapping these results to the continuum random tree , we are able to deduce , @xmath6-a.s .",

    "consequently , the results we prove also demonstrate the dirichlet spectrum corresponding to this boundary satisfies the same asymptotics as the original ( neumann ) spectrum .",
    "another point of interest is that by replicating the argument of @xcite , theorem 3.7.14 , we are able to uniquely solve the dirichlet problem for poisson s equation ( with respect to @xmath566 ) on the continuum random tree , again taking @xmath569 as our boundary .",
    "the operators of the above theorem each have a dirichlet version , @xmath572 , defined in the same way as @xmath573 was from @xmath341 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath574 and @xmath575 the corresponding dirichlet and neumann eigenvalue counting functions .      since the proof of this result",
    "can be completed by repeating the argument of @xcite , lemma 5.1 , we will only present a brief outline here .",
    "first , define a quadratic form @xmath579 by setting @xmath580 , where @xmath581 is the set @xmath582 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath579 is a local dirichlet form on @xmath364 and the natural inclusion map from @xmath581 to @xmath364 is compact , @xmath6-a.s .",
    "thus we can define the related eigenvalue counting function @xmath583 and , by @xcite , lemma 5.4 , we have @xmath584 for all @xmath20 , @xmath6-a.s .",
    "now , fix @xmath585 and suppose @xmath84 is an eigenfunction of @xmath586 with eigenvalue @xmath587 , where the domain @xmath588 of @xmath572 is defined analogously to @xmath589 and @xmath590 .",
    "if we set @xmath591 then , by definition , we have that , for @xmath592 , @xmath593 thus @xmath594 is an eigenfunction of @xmath595 with eigenvalue @xmath20 .",
    "hence it is clear that @xmath596 for all @xmath20 , @xmath6-a.s . , which completes the proof of the left - hand inequality of ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "the right - hand inequality of ( [ ineq ] ) is proved using a similar decomposition of a suitable enlargement of @xmath363 , see @xcite , proposition 5.2 , for details .",
    "the remaining parts of the lemma are a simple application of dirichlet - neumann bracketing , see @xcite , lemma 5.4 , for example .    for the remainder of this section",
    ", we will continue to follow @xcite , and proceed by defining a time - shifted general branching process , @xmath49 . although the results we shall prove will be in terms of @xmath597 , the second set of inequalities in the above lemma imply that the asymptotics of @xmath598 , and consequently @xmath23 , are the same .",
    "define the functions @xmath599 by , for @xmath600 , @xmath601 and let @xmath602 .",
    "clearly , the paths of @xmath603 are cadlag , and lemma [ 6.2 ] implies that the functions take values in @xmath604 $ ] , @xmath6-a.s . if we set @xmath605 , and @xmath606 , then it is possible to check that the following evolution equation holds : @xmath607 and also that @xmath608 the equation at ( [ evo ] ) is particularly important , as it will allow us to use branching process and renewal techniques to obtain the results of interest .",
    "we start by investigating the mean behaviour of @xmath49 , and will now introduce the notation necessary to do this .",
    "set @xmath609 , and define , for @xmath600 , @xmath610 furthermore , define the measure @xmath611 by @xmath612)=\\sum_{i=1}^3 \\mathbf{p}(w(i)^3\\geq e^{-t})$ ] , and let @xmath613 be the measure that satisfies @xmath614 .",
    "some properties of these objects are collected in the following lemma .",
    "[ props ] ( a ) the function @xmath172 is bounded and measurable , and @xmath615 as @xmath616 .",
    "+ ( b ) the function @xmath617 is in @xmath618 and @xmath619 as @xmath620 .",
    "+ ( c ) the measure @xmath613 is a borel probability measure on @xmath621 , and the integral @xmath622 is finite .",
    "a fact that may be deduced from ( [ resineq ] ) , and will be important in proving parts ( a ) and ( b ) , is that @xmath6-a.s .",
    ", @xmath623 , for every @xmath624 . in particular",
    ", this implies that the bottom of the dirichlet spectrum is bounded below by @xmath625 , and consequently we must have @xmath626 for @xmath627 , @xmath6-a.s .",
    "hence , @xmath628 applying this result , the alternative representation of @xmath49 at ( [ alter ] ) , and the independence of @xmath629 and @xmath630 , we obtain @xmath631 where @xmath346 is an independent copy of @xmath5 .",
    "applying standard branching process techniques to the process with particles @xmath166 , where @xmath166 has offspring @xmath632 at time @xmath633 after its birth , @xmath230 , it is possible to show that @xmath634 , for every @xmath600 ; the exponent 2 that arises is the malthusian parameter for the relevant branching process .",
    "thus , for @xmath600 , @xmath635 since @xmath636 , and , as remarked in the proof of lemma [ 5.1 ] , @xmath637 has finite positive moments , we are able to deduce that the right hand side of the above inequality is finite .",
    "thus , @xmath172 is bounded .",
    "the measurability of @xmath172 follows from the fact that @xmath49 has cadlag paths , @xmath6-a.s . to demonstrate the limit result , we recall the bound at ( [ etazeronound ] ) , which we apply to ( [ alter ] ) to obtain @xmath638 where @xmath346 is again an independent copy of @xmath5 . applying markov s inequality to this expression",
    ", we find that , for @xmath639 , @xmath640 taking @xmath641 , we have @xmath642 , so the sum over @xmath34 is finite , as is the expectation involving @xmath643 .",
    "consequently , the upper bound converges to zero as @xmath616 , which completes the proof of ( a ) .    that @xmath644 is finite for @xmath600 follows from the fact that @xmath645 is , and the measurability of @xmath617 is a result of @xmath646 having cadlag paths , @xmath6-a.s",

    "thus , again applying ( [ etazeronound ] ) , we see that @xmath644 is bounded above by @xmath649 for all @xmath650 , which readily implies the remaining claims of ( b ) .",
    "the importance of the previous lemma is that it allows us to apply the renewal theorem to deduce the mean behaviour of @xmath49 , with the precise result being presented in the following proposition .",
    "part ( a ) of theorem [ second ] is an easy corollary of this .      after multiplying by @xmath654 and taking expectations , the equation at ( [ evo ] )",
    "may be rewritten , for @xmath600 , @xmath655 which is the double - sided renewal equation of @xcite .",
    "the results that are proved about @xmath172 , @xmath617 and @xmath613 in lemma [ props ] mean that the conditions of the renewal theorem stated in @xcite are satisfied , and the proposition follows from this .    to determine the @xmath6-a.s .",
    "behaviour of @xmath49 , and prove part ( b ) of theorem [ second ] , the argument of @xcite , section 5 , may be used . note that this method is in turn an adaptation of nerman s results on the almost - sure behaviour of general branching processes , see @xcite .",
    "since the steps of our proof are almost identical to those of @xcite , we shall omit many of the details here .",
    "one point that should be highlighted , however , is that in the proof of lemma 5.7 of @xcite there is an error , with one of the relevant terms being omitted from consideration .",
    "we shall explain how to deal with this term , and also correct the limiting procedure that should be used at the end of the argument .",
    "for the purposes of the proof , we introduce the following notation to represent a cut - set of @xmath656 : for @xmath52 , @xmath657 we will also have cause to refer to the subset of @xmath658 defined by , for @xmath659 , @xmath660      first , we truncate the characteristics @xmath663 by defining , for fixed @xmath664 , @xmath665 , where @xmath666 is an integer that will be chosen later in the proof ( we are using the term `` characteristic '' in the generalised sense of @xcite , section 7 , to describe a random function that , if the characteristic is indexed by @xmath169 , can depend on @xmath667 ) . from these truncated characteristics ,",
