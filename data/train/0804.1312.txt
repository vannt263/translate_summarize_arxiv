    "thermodynamics usually deals with the systems of infinite number of degree of freedoms , in which relative fluctuations of the observable , e.g. , energy , particle number , are inversely proportional to the square root of the numbers of the particles of the system @xcite .",
    "hence for a macroscopic system consisting of infinite number of particles , the fluctuations are vanishingly small and the ensemble average can describe thermodynamic phenomena completely .",
    "however , concerning small systems , usually the fluctuations of the microscopic values of thermodynamic observable will become appreciable , and ensemble average alone can not longer give a complete description @xcite . in recent years , increasing interests are drawn to the study of thermodynamics of small system , and the emphases are put on the fluctuations of the microscopic value of the observable , instead of their ensemble average . some notable progresses have been made , examples including the jarzynski equality @xcite and the fluctuation theorem @xcite .",
    "the former connects the free energy difference of two equilibrium states with ensemble average of microscopic work in non - equilibrium process while the later illustrates the probabilistic entropy decrease \" of a closed system within short time , or transient  violation \" of the second law .",
    "these studies shed new light on the understanding of non - equilibrium thermodynamical processes of biological motors in cells and promise important applications to the design of small - size machines . in all these studies , for small systems ,",
    "though fluctuations of most observables are appreciable , there exists an exception  the work done during a slowest reversible equilibrium process ( we use isothermal processes to replace slowest reversible processes hereafter ) .",
    "it has been pointed out that the fluctuation of microscopic work done by or on a small system during a slowest reversible process is vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , though the fluctuations of microscopic work for small systems in finite - time irreversible processes has been extensively studied @xcite , and the vanishing fluctuation of microscopic work of classical small systems specially concerning thermodynamic isothermal process has been point out , to our best knowledge , a rigorous proof of the above result from microscopic aspect is still lacking , and its quantum mechanical generalization has not been studied yet .    in this paper , we will investigate this problem by simulating a quantum isothermal process with infinite number of infinitesimal quantum adiabatic process ( qap ) and quantum isochoric process ( qip ) @xcite .",
    "we prove rigorously from microscopic aspect the above result that , for a two - level system , the fluctuations of the microscopic work during an quantum isothermal process @xcite is vanishingly small .",
    "we emphasize that , different from most cases in conventional statistical mechanics , where fluctuations vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , the vanishing work fluctuations for a small system in an isothermal process is due to the intrinsic nature of isothermal process .",

    "the system remains in its microscopic state @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) if the system is initially in its microscopic state @xmath6 ( @xmath61 ) .",

    "the microscopic work done and their probabilities for the remaining steps can be obtained through a similar analysis .",
    "because in every qip , the system is independently thermalized by the heat bath , then there should be no correlations of the probabilities distributions in every two neighbor steps , or alternatively , this process is markovian process .",
    "hence , the total microscopic work done after the @xmath29-step is a sum of microscopic works done in all steps and the joint probabilities for the @xmath29-step as a whole is the product of that of all steps .    for a special example that the microscopic work done during the whole process is @xmath75 where @xmath39 is that for each qip step , the joint probabilities for the system keeping in @xmath60 in every qip is @xmath76 = p_{e}^{1}p_{e}^{2}% \\cdots p_{e}^{n}$ ] .",

    "the numerical result indicates vanishing probability for @xmath139 . for @xmath140 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , the numerical result show even more vanishing probabilities of microscopic work . that is , the dispersion ( fluctuation ) of microscopic work decrease with the increase of @xmath29 . actually , from the above numerical figures , it is not difficult to find that the dispersion of the microscopic work distribution is inversely proportional to the square root of @xmath29 .",

    "2 ) . hence",
    ", numerical results agrees well with our heuristic analysis and both they verified our main result , when @xmath143 , the fluctuations of microscopic work vanishes .",
    "as we have mentioned before , for small systems and within short time , the formulation entropy never decrease for a closed system `` of the second law may be transiently violated '' probabilistically due to appreciable fluctuations @xcite .",
    "a straightforward question is : will the other formulations of the second law , e.g. , the minimum work principle @xcite , also be transiently violated `` probabilistically for small systems ?",
    "the minimum work principle '' states that when varying the speed of a given process for an initially equilibrium system , the work is minimal for the slowest realization of the process \" @xcite . in the following",

    "3 we plot the averaged work @xmath150 as a function of @xmath29 ( [ 15 ] ) .",
    "it can be seen that for the two - level system , @xmath150 is a monotically decreasing function of @xmath29 ( time @xmath9 ) , and when @xmath151 , the averaged work @xmath150 approaches an asymptotic value , and its minimum value  the difference of the free energy .",
    "thus , from the numerical result it can be inferred that the  minimum work principle \" still holds for a two - level system .",
    "the above proof of minimum work principle can be alternatively understood in the following way . from the above analytical and numerical result",

    "@xcite , @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the average work done during an irreversible process . combining the two results , we have @xmath155 .",
    "thus we proved the minimum work principle for small system .",
    "before concluding this paper , we would like to emphasize the following points : first , the technique of simulating isothermal processes with adiabatic processes and isochoric processes are important to our proof , which enables us to establish the connection between large time limit and large n limit .",
    "second , the calculation of exact expression of microscopic work in our paper is non - trivial because the work contributions in the different steps are not identically distributed .",
    "hence , it is different from the law of large numbers , with time as the large number @xcite .",
    "third , we proved the minimum work principle \" formulation of the second law stands for even small system , though other formulations may be transiently  violated \" probabilistically @xcite .",
    "this is not surprising because  minimum work principle \" concerns infinite - long - time processes , which has no contradiction with the transient  violation `` of the second law for small systems predicted by the fluctuation theorem .",
    "actually , the fluctuation theorem does not constitute real violation of the second law , which is a statistical law and holds when averaged over different realization of the process .",
    "fourth , the isothermal process is reversible , but the finite @xmath29 step path '' is irreversible , due to the qip ( thermolization ) is irreversible .",
    "we can thus expect that the work dissipation @xcite for the finite @xmath29 step path will be finite and will decrease with the increase of @xmath29 , and finally vanishes when @xmath29 approaches infinity .    in summary , by simulating an quantum isothermal process with infinite many infinitesimal qap and qip",
    ", we obtain the analytical expressions of microscopic work distribution in an isothermal process . through both analytical and numerical analysis",
    ", we rigorously verify that the fluctuations of microscopic work distribution vanishes even for a small system in an isothermal process .",
    "this result is different from the usual fluctuations in statistical mechanics , e.g. , the energy fluctuation and particle number fluctuation in canonical ensamble and grand canonical ensamble , where the fluctuations of energy and particle nubmers approaches zero when the system approaches thermodynamic limit ( particle number approaches infinity @xmath156 ) . here",
    ", however , even for single particle system , we microscopically demonstrate the vanishing of microscopic work fluctuation . because @xmath157 is a must to simulate an isothermal process",
    ", we conclude that the vanishing of microscopic work fluctuations is due to the intrinsic nature of isothermal process , rather than the thermodynamic limit of the system size .",
    "we also prove that for a small system , the  minimum work principle \" formulation of the second law holds though other formulations maybe transiently  violated \" probabilistically .",
    "finally we would like to point it out that our result is universal and does not depend on the specific model used here , because the technique of simulating the isothermal process with the isochoric process and the adiabatic process can be applied to any systems",
