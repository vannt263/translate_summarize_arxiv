    "subgroup of @xmath9 .",
    "the special properties of the pair @xmath10 are among the principal reasons why the representation theory of @xmath9 is in many respects simpler than that of the other reductive groups over @xmath5 ( see e.g.  @xcite ,  @xcite ) .",
    "one more remarkable feature of the pair @xmath10 was discovered by p.  etingof and v.  ginzburg a few years ago .",
    "namely , the quantum hamiltonian reduction of the differential operators on @xmath9 with respect to @xmath6 is isomorphic to the spherical trigonometric cherednik algebra @xmath11 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; equivalently , the quantum hamiltonian reduction of the differential operators on @xmath12 with respect to @xmath9 is isomorphic to @xmath11 .",
    "thus one is led to study the d - modules on @xmath12 whose quantum hamiltonian reduction lies in the category @xmath13 for @xmath11 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "each unipotent class is special , and each cell contains a unique character sheaf ; thus the unipotent character sheaves are classified by their ( nilpotent ) singular supports , so they are numbered by partitions of @xmath4 .",
    "finally , recall that the cells in question are the two - sided kazhdan - lusztig cells of the finite hecke algebra @xmath16 .",
