    "this paper is concerned with the effects of inhomogeneities in oscillatory media . as a prototype we study the complex ginzburg - landau equation , @xmath1 which is known to approximate the phase and amplitude of modulation patterns in reaction diffusion systems near a supercritical hopf bifurcation @xcite .",
    "stationary in time inhomogeneities which produce a localized change in the phase of oscillations in such a system can be well modeled by the inclusion of a term @xmath2 in .",
    "the effects of such inhomogeneities can vary dramatically depending on the sign of @xmath3 and the space dimension .",
    "this has been explored formally in the phase - diffusion approximation in @xcite , and for general reaction - diffusion equations and radially symmetric inhomogeneities in @xcite .",
    "most notably , inhomogeneities can create wave sources in space dimension 1 and 2 . in dimension 3 and radial geometry",
    "it was shown in @xcite that sources are weak , that is , wavenumbers decay in the far field . in this note",
    ", we establish a similar result _ without _ the assumption of radial symmetry and without relying on spatial dynamics .",
    "in addition , we relax the assumption of spatial decay of @xmath4 .    to accomplish this task we hope to use the implicit function theorem to find approximations near a spatially homogeneous solution to the complex ginzburg - landau equation .",
    "as we will see , the linearization about these steady solutions results in an operator which is not fredholm in the usual translation invariant sobolev spaces .",
    "this is a consequence of zero belonging to the essential spectrum , which in some instances can be taken care of by working in exponentially localized spaces .",
    "however , since we will be considering algebraically localized inhomogeneities these spaces do not provide the appropriate framework , the use of exponential weights would turn the linearization into a semi - fredholm operator with infinite dimensional cokernel . instead , we will use an approach based on functional analysis and try to recover fredholm properties of the linearization using kondratiev spaces and the results from @xcite , where it was shown that the laplacian is a fredholm operator .",
    "in addition to kondratiev spaces , our method relies on weighted sobolev space .",
    "we will see that for certain weights of the form @xmath5 the linearization about steady solutions possesses a cokernel .",
    "we will therefore consider an ansatz which adds far field corrections and obtain as a result an invertible operator .",
    "this approach works well for weights with @xmath6 , however for @xmath7 these correction terms prove to be problematic since they result in nonlinearities which are not well defined , i.e. they do no belong to the correct weighted space .",
    "the same is true in the 2 dimensional case for all weights that account for decaying inhomogeneities .",
    "we hope to address these issues in the future and restrict ourselves in the present paper to the 3 dimensional case with @xmath6 .",
    "this will provide a straight forward example where the advantage of viewing the linearization in the setting of kondratiev spaces can be appreciated without the extra complications coming form the nonlinearity .",
    "we begin the analysis by considering the spatially homogeneous solution @xmath8 of equation and looking for approximations of the form @xmath9 . in section [ proof ] we will show , using lyapunov - schimdt reduction , that in dimension 3 it is possible to find solutions near @xmath10 . the asymptotics for the function @xmath11 will show that in the far field the wavenumber @xmath12 decays to zero and hence target patterns will not form .",
    "we state this result in the following theorem :    [ th : main ] suppose @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 . then , there exist @xmath16 and smooth functions @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that @xmath19 is a family of solutions to near @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , for fixed @xmath22 and @xmath23 , the functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 satisfy the following asymptotics in @xmath26 , @xmath27 as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is a smooth function satisfying the expansion @xmath30 . in particular , @xmath31    1 .   notice that we do not have asymptotic predictions for the amplitude , just an upper bound on the rate of its decay .",
    "the values of @xmath32 are related to the choice of spaces we make . in the case of @xmath13",
    "our analysis shows that the linearization about the steady solution @xmath33 is a fredholm operator of index @xmath34 .",
    "if we consider weights with @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , the linearization is again a fredholm operator , but now with a larger co - kernel consisting of harmonic polynomials of degree @xmath37 . in this case",
    ", it seems reasonable to add to the ansatz a series of correction terms which would span the cokernel of our linearization .",
    "in particular , these terms should consist of derivatives of the fundamental solution @xmath38 of all degrees up to @xmath37 .",
    "the difficulty in this case is that this type of ansatz results in a non - linear operator which is not well defined in @xmath39 ( see proposition [ prop : nonlinearity ] ) . nonetheless , because @xmath40 for @xmath41 , if we consider a very localized inhomogeneity we can always assume it is in a space @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , theorem [ th : main ] holds for @xmath44 with @xmath45 , and in this case we take @xmath46 for the bounds of @xmath47 .",
    "however , for these values of @xmath48 it is still an open problem to determine if this bound is sharp .",
    "3 .   in the case of @xmath49 , we can consider spaces which yield an invertible linearization .",
    "our analysis then shows that the amplitude @xmath17 should obey the same decay as stated in theorem [ th : main ] , but we do not expect phase decay at order o(1/|x| ) .",
    "in fact , the coefficient of the leading order term , @xmath50 , is not necessarily defined when @xmath51 is in @xmath52 .",
    "our result would only give decay associated with the function space @xmath53 ( see lemma 3.2 ) .",
    "4 .   finally , we just point out that we are not interested in studying inhomogeneities with slow decay , @xmath54 , or that grow algebraically , and so we do not look at the case when @xmath55 .",
    "the predictions of theorem [ th : main ] agree with the results found in @xcite , where the authors show that in the more general case of reaction diffusion equations and in dimensions 3 and higher , there exists only contact defects ( the wave number @xmath56 in the far field ) and obtain asymptotics for the wavenumber @xmath57 , @xmath58 where the notation @xmath59 means that these terms go to zero as @xmath60 .",
    "this implies that for large values of @xmath61 and fixed @xmath3 we do not see a pace maker effect . nonetheless , if we fix @xmath61 large we can approximate the group velocity , @xmath62 , for the family of solutions @xmath63 in terms of @xmath3 : @xmath64    -axis for the cross section @xmath65 . for the parameter values used in the simulation the expression @xmath66",
    "as a result , a negative phase gradient as @xmath28 indicates a positive group velocity , whereas a positive phase gradient as @xmath28 indicates a negative group velocity . ]    in particular , if @xmath67 then @xmath68 and we obtain weak wave sources .",
    "these results were confirmed in numerical simulations with a cubic domain of length @xmath69 , parameter values @xmath70 , and with the following inhomogeneity @xmath71 ( see figure [ groupvelocity ] ) .",
    "all simulations were done with an exponential time differencing algorithm ( etdrk4 ) following the methods found in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ weighted ] , we define weighted sobolev spaces and kondratiev spaces and state fredholm properties for the laplace operator .",
    "next , in section [ proof ] we give a proof of our main result and finally , in section [ numerics ] , we present numerical simulations of our results .",
    "in particular , we show the decay rates for the amplitude and phase agree with our predictions .",
    "in this paper we consider the weight @xmath72 and define the weighted sobolev spaces , @xmath73 , as the completion of @xmath74 under the norm @xmath75 with @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "notice that we have inclusions of the form @xmath79 for any real numbers @xmath80 such that @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore , we have the following proposition which was proven in @xcite .    [ sobolev ]",
    "the operator @xmath82 is invertible for all real numbers @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "the above proposition also shows why the laplace operator does not have closed range when considered in the setting of weighted sobolev spaces : just as in the case of @xmath85 , we can construct weyl s sequences for the laplace operator proving that zero is in the essential spectrum .",
    "we summarize this results as a lemma :    [ notfredholm ] the operator @xmath86 is not a fredholm operator for @xmath84 .      a slight variation of the above spaces are kondratiev spaces , where the exponent in the weight @xmath87 is increased by one every time we take a derivate .",
    "we denote them here by @xmath88 , and defined them as the completion of @xmath89 under the norm @xmath90 again we let @xmath91 , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 .    in general , kondratiev spaces are studied in connection with boundary value problems for elliptic equations in domains with critical points @xcite .",
    "they also appear in the setting of unbounded domains .",
    "for example , nirenberg and walker showed in @xcite that a class of elliptic operators with coefficients that decay sufficiently fast at infinity have finite dimensional kernel .",
    "additionally , mcowen and lockhart used this spaces to study fredholm properties of elliptic operators and systems of elliptic operators in non - compact manifolds @xcite .",
    "moreover , kondratiev spaces have also been used in the description of far field asymptotics for fluid problems , in particular when studying the flow past obstacles , since they lend themselves to the study of problems in exterior domains ( see @xcite for the case of @xmath92 and @xcite for an application towards bifurcation theory ) .",
    "more recently , a variant of these spaces was used in @xcite to study poisson s equation in a one - periodic infinite strip @xmath93 \\times \\mathbb{r}$ ] .",
    "the main advantage for us is that in kondratiev spaces the laplace operator is a fredholm operator .",
    "these results are shown in mcowen s paper @xcite and are summarized in the following theorem .",
    "[ mcowen ] let @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 or @xmath97 , for some @xmath36 .",
    "then @xmath98 is a fredholm operator and    1 .",
    "for @xmath99 the map is an isomorphism ; 2 .   for @xmath100 , @xmath36 ,",
    "the map is injective with closed range equal to @xmath101 3 .   for @xmath102 , @xmath36 ,",
    "the map is surjective with kernel equal to @xmath103    here , @xmath104 denote the harmonic homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath105 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath106 or @xmath107 for some @xmath36 , then @xmath108 does not have closed range .",
    "to facilitate the analysis we will split this section into four parts . in subection [ setup ]",
    "we describe how we set up the problem and how we obtain a linearization which is easier to work with .",
    "next , in subsection [ proof ] we state conditions that allow us to use the implicit function theorem and derive expansions for the amplitude and phase , effectively proving the results of theorem [ th : main ] .",
    "finally , in the last two subsections we show that the linearization is invertible and the nonlinear operator associated to our problem is well defined .",
    "we recall here our main equation , the complex ginzburg - landau equation in dimension 3 , @xmath109 where @xmath4 is a localized real valued function and @xmath3 is small . in what follows",
    "we describe how we arrive at our linearization .",
    "we pass to a corotating frame @xmath110 so that @xmath111 satisfies the following equation , @xmath112    at parameter values @xmath113 and @xmath114 , the function @xmath115 is a solution to and the linearization about this constant solution is given by the following operator , @xmath116 : @xmath117 in fourier space @xmath116 can be represented by a matrix , @xmath118 , which at @xmath119 has eigenvalues @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",

    "this amounts to letting @xmath133 in and , and results in a nonlinear operator which we again label as @xmath134 . in the last section",
    "we show that there exists spaces @xmath135 and @xmath136 such that @xmath137 is well defined and smooth .",
