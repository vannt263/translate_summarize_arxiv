    "further , next-100 @xcite experiment will be able to bring down the above value of the order of 0.1 ev .",
    "thus in an optimistic point of view such property of neutrino could be testified by the next generation experiments .",
    "however , even if it is possible to pin down the value of @xmath6 , it is still difficult to predict the values of the majorana phases until we can fix the absolute neutrino mass scale .",
    "it is shown in ref.@xcite that in addition to the @xmath7 decay experiments , lepton number violating processes in which the majorana phases show up are also corroborative to determine the individual majorana phases .",
    "another interesting physical aspect such as contribution of the majorana phases to the generation of @xmath9 within the present @xmath10 range of neutrino oscillation global fit data is also studied in the literature@xcite .",
    "@xcite discusses how to constrain the majorana phases using the results from cosmology and double beta decay .",
    "thus it is worthwhile to study the calculability of the majorana phases in terms of a general neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath11 ) parameters . in the present work",
    "we evaluate individual majorana phases in terms of the parameters of a general @xmath11 using three rephasing invariants @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 presented in ref.@xcite on the basis of mohapatra - rodejohann s phase convention@xcite .",
    "although there are several papers which discusses the general procedure for calculating the majorana phases , motivation behind taking the rephasing invariants is that the methodology we present here is capable of calculating the majorana phase in a model independent way even if one of the eigenvalue is zero which is still allowed as far as the present neutrino oscillation global fit data is concerned .",
    "moreover as one of the rephasing invariant ( @xmath3 ) is directly proportional to @xmath12 , therefore it vanishes if @xmath13 and hence shows a strong dependency of the majorana phases with the light neutrino masses . in the present work we evaluate the majorana phases for a general complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix ( @xmath11 ) taking into account the global fit oscillation data and the upper bound on the sum of the three light neutrino masses ( @xmath4 ) along with the @xmath5 decay parameter for both the hierarchical cases .",
    "we then conclude except the case of quasi degeneracy ] , the methodology presented in this work is able to calculate the majorana phases , given any model of neutrino masses and for convenience , we further numerically estimate the ranges of each majorana phase for both types of hierarchies , in the context of a cyclic symmetric model as well as a model with scaling ansatz property .",
    "it is also shown that all the sub cases we present in inverted hierarchy section of the general discussion can be realized through the choice of a model with scaling ansatz with texture zeros within the framework of inverse seesaw while one of the phenomenologically viable sub case of the normal hierarchy section is yet to be identified .",

    "experimental observation of neutrino flavour oscillation constitutes a robust evidence in favour of nonzero neutrino masses .",
    "the flavour transition process is basically a quantum mechanical interference phenomena with the explicit relationship between the left handed quantum fields ( @xmath14 ) of the flavour basis and the mass basis ( @xmath15 ) as _ l&=&_i u^*_i_il where @xmath16 corresponds to the flavour index and @xmath17 implies the mass index and the matrix @xmath18 is the corresponding neutrino mixing matrix . for three generation of fermions ,",

    "regarding the structure of @xmath29 matrix we would like to mention the following : the advantage of using the above majorana phase convention is that for @xmath13 it is possible to calculate the single existing majorana phase @xmath30 while , for @xmath33 , only the phase difference @xmath34 is calculable .",
    "the result will be reversed if we utilize the pdg@xcite convention .",
    "explicitly , with pdg convention , if @xmath13 , only the phase difference is calculable , however if @xmath35 is vanishing it is possible to calculate the existing majorana phase . based on pdg convention two of the authors presented a detailed calculation @xcite for both the majorana phases in context of a general @xmath11 , however , if one of the eigenvalue is zero which is still allowed by the present neutrino experimental data , it is not possible to calculate individual phases in that case .",

    "considering neutrinos as the majorana fermions in extended standard model one can parametrize @xmath23 with the cp violating phases as given in eqn.([a ] ) where we redefine the charged lepton fields absorbing the unphysical phases of total mixing matrix @xmath37 . hence , in principle the mixing matrix @xmath37 can be defined as up_u_pmns[uckm ] where @xmath38 is a @xmath39 diagonal phase ( unphysical ) matrix and is given by p_&=&diag ( e^i_1,e^i_2,e^i_3 ) .",

    "a general solution for a three generation complex symmetric majorana mass matrix is given in ref.@xcite . in order to estimate the majorana phases obtained in the present work we utilize the expressions of the three eigenvalues and the three mixing angles .",
    "we also use the global fit data of neutrino oscillation experiments shown in table [ tl ] and the upper limits on the sum of the neutrino masses ( @xmath76 ev)@xcite and the @xmath5 parameter ( @xmath77 ev)@xcite to obtain model independent ranges of the majorana phases .",

    "therefore , a natural question arises how and where these phases can be measured . as a direct detection , in ref .",
    "@xcite xing suggested a thought experiment ( neutrino@xmath78 antineutrino oscillation ) in which he pointed out these phases may appear in the probability expression of the flavour oscillation and thus also in the expression of the cp asymmetry parameter @xmath79 which is the measure of cp violation .",
    "however , this kind of experiment is purely academic at this moment and practically difficult to design as the oscillation probability is highly suppressed by the factor @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the mass of the light neutrino and @xmath82 is the beam energy .",
    "now considering @xmath82 @xmath83 mev and the masses of the neutrinos to be less than 1 ev , one can calculate @xmath80 to be @xmath84 . to improve @xmath85 ,",
    "a novel suggestion@xcite is to lower the value of @xmath82 , however , in that case the estimated size of the base line length and the detector are beyond the reach of the present experimental facilities . but as an optimistic point of view we expect these kind of experiments will be designed in future and thus the prediction of the majorana phases will be tested . beside neutrino @xmath78 antineutrino oscillation",

    "moreover the models with certain flavour symmetries are highly predictive in nature . therefore , precise measurement of the cp violating phases may act as the important tools to verify the testability of the flavour models@xcite . in inverted hierarchy section we present a model with scaling ansatz and texture zeros within the framework of inverse seesaw through which all the sub cases presented in sec .",
    "[ invh ] can be realized while in the normal hierarchy section we present a model with cyclic symmetry within the framework of type i seesaw .",
    "obviously the choices are for illustration .",

    "the above numerical results are obtained for the general @xmath11 where all the 9 independent parameters are present . however , as previously said , one can reduce the number of parameters by invoking some symmetry or ansatz in the lagrangian which is more predictive in nature and thus testable in the experiments . in this section",
    "we provide applications of the general results in few typical cases for both the hierarchies , normal and inverted .",
    "in this case we explore a model that corresponds to * case i * of the normal hierarchical scenario mentioned in section ( [ nrmlh ] ) .",

    "<S> we evaluate the majorana phases for a general @xmath0 complex symmetric neutrino mass matrix on the basis of mohapatra - rodejohann s phase convention using the three rephasing invariant quantities @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 proposed by sarkar and singh . </S>",
    "<S> we find them interesting as they allow us to evaluate each majorana phase in a model independent way even if one eigenvalue is zero . utilizing the solution of a general complex symmetric mass matrix for eigenvalues and mixing angles we determine the majorana phases for both the hierarchies , normal and inverted , taking into account the constraints from neutrino oscillation global fit data as well as bound on the sum of the three light neutrino masses ( @xmath4 ) and the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath5 ) parameter @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this methodology of finding the majorana phases is applied thereafter in some predictive models for both the hierarchical cases ( normal and inverted ) to evaluate the corresponding majorana phases and it is shown that all the sub cases presented in inverted hierarchy section can be realized in a model with texture zeros and scaling ansatz within the framework of inverse seesaw although one of the sub case following the normal hierarchy is yet to be established . except the case of quasi degenerate neutrinos , </S>",
