    "soon after the discovery of about a dozen pulsating b - type subdwarfs ( sdb ) by the south african astronomical observatory astronomers [ @xcite and the next papers of the series ] , two other groups ( billres et al .",
    "2002 , stensen et al .",
    "2001a , b , silvotti et al .",
    "2002a ) undertook extensive searches for these interesting multiperiodic pulsators , called  after the prototype  the ec14026 stars .",
    "the searches resulted in finding further variables , so that there are 32 ec14026 stars known at present .",
    "their pulsation periods range between 1.5 and 10 minutes , with a typical value of 23 minutes .",
    "the amplitudes are rather small and rarely exceed 10  mmag .",
    "some extreme cases are known , however .",
    "the longest periods are observed among the members having the lowest surface gravity : v338  ser = pg1605 + 072 ( koen et al .",
    "1998a , kilkenny et al .  1999 ) , kl  uma = feige48 ( koen et al .",
    "1998b , reed et al .",

    "2001 ) , v2214  cyg = kpd1930 + 2752 ( billres et al .",
    "2000 ) , v391  peg = hs2201 + 2610 ( stensen et al .",
    "2001a , silvotti et al .",
    "2002b ) , and hs0702 + 6043 ( dreizler et al .",
    "some of them ( e.g. , v338  ser and hs0702 + 6043 ) have large amplitudes .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered another high - amplitude and cool ec14026 star , balloon090100001 = gsc02248 - 01751 ( hereafter bal09 ) .",
    "the semi - amplitude of one of the detected modes amounts to 60  mmag in white light , the largest amplitude known in an ec14026 star . with @xmath5 11.8  mag ,",
    "the star is actually one of the brightest members of the group .",
    "b - type subdwarfs are believed to be low - mass ( @xmath60.5  @xmath7 ) evolved stars that burn helium in their cores ( heber 1986 , saffer et al .",
    "1994 ) . in the h - r diagram",
    "they populate the extended horizontal branch ( ehb ) region .",
    "as their hydrogen envelopes are very thin , they do not ascend the asymptotic giant branch and do not pass the planetary nebula phase of evolution @xcite .",
    "instead , they evolve almost directly to the white - dwarf stage , passing only through the hotter sdo phase @xcite .",
    "their evolutionary past , however , is not well understood .",
    "the discovery of pulsations in sdb stars opened therefore a new way for investigating their internal structure by means of asteroseismology ( see , e.g. , brassard et al .",
    "the effective temperatures of ec14026 stars range from 29000 to 36000  k , their surface gravities , @xmath8 = 5.26.1 .",
    "they do not occupy , however , a well - defined instability strip in the @xmath9@xmath8 plane but are spread among non - pulsating sdb stars .",
    "curiously enough , their pulsations were predicted almost at the time of discovery @xcite as corresponding to radial and nonradial low - order low - degree @xmath10 modes driven by the @xmath11 mechanism .",
    "the driving comes from the metal opacity bump that originates from the ionization of heavy metals , mainly iron ( charpinet et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ) .",
    "about two years ago , @xcite discovered low - amplitude multiperiodic light variations with periods of the order of one hour among the coolest ( @xmath12 30000  k ) sdb stars",
    ". the periods of the members of this new class of variable stars indicate that they are high - order @xmath1 modes .",
    "although @xcite announced the discovery of 20 stars of this type , detailed analysis was so far published only for the prototype , pg1716 + 426 @xcite .",
    "the pulsations were explained by means of the same pulsation mechanism as the short - period ones @xcite , but with degrees @xmath2 = 3 or 4 .",
    "as far as the effective temperature and the character of excited modes are concerned , the two classes of variable sdb stars resemble younger main - sequence pulsators , @xmath13  cephei and spb stars ( see , e.g. , pamyatnykh 1999 ) . in the @xmath9@xmath8 plane ,",
    "the areas where the ec14026 stars and their long - period counterparts are found slightly overlap .",
    "it seems therefore possible that both kinds of pulsations observed in sdb stars might coexist in a single star of this type .",
    "the sdb nature of bal09 was discovered by @xcite using the balloon - borne scap ultraviolet telescope .",
    "its short - period variability was detected by @xcite by means of the 80-cm iac80 telescope at observatorio del teide ( tenerife ) .",
    "the effective temperature of 29500  k and @xmath14 5.3 , derived by the same authors , place it among the coolest and most evolved ec14026 stars . from the data obtained on a single observational night ,",
    "@xcite were able to detect only two independent modes .",
    "owing to the large amplitude and relatively long periods , the star was an obvious target for follow - up time - series photometry .",
    "we therefore decided to carry out multicolour observations of this star .",
    "new observations were also obtained by the discoverers ( oreiro , private communication ) . in this paper",
    ", we present the results of our photometric run , covering over a month . we show that bal09 exhibits both kinds of pulsations discovered in sdb stars .",
    "we started observing bal09 on june 30 , 2004 .",
    "the bulk of the data was , however , obtained between august 17 and september 19 , 2004 , on 18 nights .",
    "all these observations were obtained at mt .",
    "suhora observatory with a 60-cm reflecting telescope , equipped with the st-10xme ccd camera and johnson - cousins @xmath0 filters .",
    "the camera field of view was 6.8 @xmath15 4.5 arcmin and , in order to minimize storage time , the 3 @xmath15 3 pixels on - chip binning was employed . except for the first night ,",
    "june 30 , when only @xmath16 filter was used , and the second night , when @xmath17-filter measurements were not made , the observations were carried out through four filters , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 .",
    "the mean exposure times amounted respectively to 15 , 10 , 7 and 7  s , resulting in about 1 minute - long filter cycle .",
    "this enabled us to obtain roughly 6 points per main pulsation period of bal09 in all four filters . in total ,",
    "125 hours of observations were obtained in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 filters , 119 in @xmath17 , and 126 in @xmath16 .",
    "additional observations were carried out on three observing nights between september 22 and 25 , 2004 , at loiano observatory with the 1.52-m cassini telescope and the bfosc ccd camera covering 13 @xmath15 12.6 arcmin on the sky . in total",
    ", we gathered 13 hours of observations only in filter @xmath17 .",
    "the exposure times were 10 or 15  s long , depending on sky conditions .",
    "the time distribution of all observations is shown in fig .",
    "[ data ] .",
    "magnitudes of bal09 obtained during our run , plotted against heliocentric julian day .",
    "the observations were obtained at mt .  suhora observatory , except those on the last three nights in @xmath17 that were taken at loiano observatory.,width=313 ]    over 7000 individual frames were obtained in @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath16 and about 8500 in @xmath17 .",
    "all these frames were corrected for bias , dark and flatfield in a standard way .",
    "then , the magnitudes of all stars detected in a frame were obtained by means of profile - fitting procedures of the daophot package @xcite .",
    "the aperture magnitudes were also derived . in order to minimize photometric errors ,",
    "the apertures were scaled with seeing . as a measure of seeing",
    ", we used the @xmath20s of the two - dimensional gaussian function that described the analytical part of the point - spread function ( psf ) calculated by daophot .",
    "the positions of the stars were also taken from the psf fits .",
    "the seeing scaling factor , optimal from the point of view of the photometric errors , depended on the aperture magnitude of a star .",
    "we derived the character of this dependence from the post - fit residuals on a single good night and then applied it to all observations . as a comparison star",
    ", we chose the nearby , relatively bright star , gsc02248 - 00063 .",
    "it is brighter than bal09 in @xmath19 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 , but slightly fainter in @xmath18 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ data ] , the mean differential magnitudes range from @xmath210.23  mag in @xmath18 to 1.54  mag in @xmath16 . this large range reflects large differences in colour between bal09 and the comparison star . surprisingly , there is practically no difference between the mean differential magnitudes for the @xmath17-filter data from mt .",
    "suhora and loiano .",
    "this means that the instrumental systems in both sites are very similar and the @xmath17 data can be safely combined .",
    "the differential aperture photometry showed less scatter than the psf photometry .",
    "consequently , for the frequency analysis that follows , we used the aperture photometry .",
    "one night s sample differential magnitudes in @xmath17 are shown in fig .",
    "[ night55 ] .    .",
    "the solid line is the synthetic light - curve consisting of 30 periodic terms listed in table 1.,width=313 ]",
    "prior to the frequency analysis , we rejected data points that had photometric errors larger than a certain , arbitrarily chosen value , viz .",
    ", 0.04  mag for @xmath18 , 0.03  mag for @xmath19 , and 0.025  mag for @xmath17 and @xmath16 . as the amplitudes of the light variation of bal09 are quite large , the next three steps , i.e. , rejecting outliers , correcting for second - order extinction effects and detrending , were done using the residuals from a preliminary fit .",
    "for this purpose , sequential prewhitening was done , until all periodic terms with signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio larger than 6 were subtracted from the data .",
    "having obtained the residuals , we first rejected all outliers from the original data employing 5-@xmath20 clipping . since the comparison star is much redder than bal09 , and we made observations through wide - band filters , second - order extinction effects can be expected . in order to correct for them",
    ", we plotted the residuals , @xmath22 , obtained earlier , against the air mass , @xmath23 , and derived the coefficients of the relation @xmath24 by means of the least - squares method .",
    "the linear coefficient , @xmath25 , was significantly different from zero and amounted to + 0.044 , + 0.033 , + 0.009 , and + 0.012 @xmath4 0.001 for @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath26 factor was then subtracted from the original data . finally , the prewhitening was repeated and new residuals were computed .    because 90% of our data in @xmath17 and all data in the remaining three filters come from the same telescope / detector combination , they constitute a very homogeneous dataset",
    "nevertheless , some instrumental effects can produce artificial trends in the data , increasing amplitudes at the lowest frequencies , making it difficult to say which low - frequency signals are real .",
    "we will discuss this problem in sect .",
    "3.7 using data that were not detrended . at the present stage ,",
    "detrending was performed , again using the residuals .",
    "first , the average magnitudes in 0.07-day intervals were calculated and then interpolated using the cubic spline fit .",
    "this fit was subtracted from the original data .",
    "the 0.07-day interval was chosen by trial and error .",
    "this choice secures that all signals at frequencies below @xmath60.1  mhz are effectively reduced while those with higher frequencies , where @xmath1 modes are observed ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , remain unaffected .",
    "detrended data were analyzed by means of the standard procedure that included calculating the fourier amplitude periodograms and sequential prewhitening of detected signals . at each step of prewhitening , the parameters of sinusoidal terms found earlier were improved by means of the non - linear least - squares method .",
    "data in each filter were analyzed independently .",
    "the periodogram of the @xmath17-filter data , up to the frequency of 10  mhz , is shown in fig .",
    "the structure of the aliases can be seen in fig .",
    "[ swind ] , where we show fourier periodogram of artificial data containing a single sinusoidal term with frequency and amplitude of the main mode and distributed in time as the real observations in @xmath17 .",
    "the daily aliases are quite high , as both sites where the @xmath17 observations were carried out are located at a similar longitude .",
    "therefore , the frequencies we derive , especially the low - amplitude ones , may suffer from the 1  ( sidereal day)@xmath27 = 11.6  @xmath3hz ambiguity .",
    "our data cover 35 days , resulting in a frequency resolution of about 0.5  @xmath3hz @xcite .",

    "[ oriv ] is dominated by the strong peak around @xmath28 2.8  mhz and its daily aliases .",
    "it is the main frequency discovered by @xcite .",
    "signals at the harmonics , 2@xmath29 ( 5.6  mhz ) and 3@xmath29 ( 8.4  mhz ) , can also be seen . the second frequency detected by these authors , at about 3.8  mhz , is also well seen .",
    "in addition , we see low - amplitude peaks at 4.7  mhz and , surprisingly , at low frequencies below 0.4  mhz .",
    "note that the peak at frequency of 0.3  mhz was already detected by @xcite , but these authors were not able to attribute it convincingly to the star because of the very short time interval of their observations .",
    "the analysis was carried out until all terms with s / n @xmath30 4.5 were extracted .",
    "the number of periodic terms found in this way was not the same in all filters , mainly due to the differences in the detection threshold .",
    "the threshold was the lowest in @xmath17 , where we found 27 independent terms and 7 combinations terms , including harmonics . in @xmath18 , we found 20 + 3 , in @xmath19 , 22 + 3 , and in @xmath16 , 23 + 6 terms .",
    "of all these terms , 17 ( including 3 combination terms ) were found in all four filters .",
    "we finally adopted a model consisting of 22 independent terms and 8 combination terms .",
    "the model comprised all terms detected in @xmath17 and at least one other filter , and all combination terms .",

    "it is difficult to say whether this is a real periodic change .",
    "we think it is rather an artefact caused by transparency changes and/or instrumental effects .",
    "the differential combination terms are not visible below 0.1  mhz ; they are probably lost in the noise .",
    "it is very important from the point of view of the results of this paper to be certain that the modes we detected , especially the low - frequency ones , are real .",
    "moreover , we would like to be certain that they originate in bal09 , and not in the comparison star .",
    "in order to verify the latter , we analyzed differential photometry of the comparison star with respect to another star in the field , gsc02248 - 00425 , called thereafter the check star . unfortunately , this star is almost 4  mag fainter than the comparison star , so that only the @xmath17 and @xmath16 photometry is usable for it .",
    "the periodograms of the differential photometry of the comparison star with respect to the check star show no peak above s / n = 3.7 corresponding to the semi - amplitude of 3.0  mmag in @xmath17 data and no peaks above s / n = 4.1 corresponding to 1.9  mmag in the @xmath16 data .",
    "this justifies that all modes with semi - amplitudes exceeding 2  mmag in @xmath16 or @xmath84  mmag in @xmath17 originate indeed in bal09 . among them , there are two low - frequency modes , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can not , however , exclude the possibility that some low - frequency modes originate in the comparison star .    an additional argument for the reality of the low - frequency modes may come from an independent detection of a given mode in the data split into two parts ; see @xcite for an example .",
    "consequently , we divided the photometry of bal09 into two , roughly equal parts , before and after hjd2453254 .",
    "then , the analysis of the two parts was performed independently .",
    "this was done for data in all four filters .",
    "of 22 independent terms from table [ fr30 ] , we detected 14 terms in both parts with s / n @xmath30 4.5 , or 16 if detection threshold was lowered to s",
    "the remaining six terms , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 , were detected in the periodogram of only one part of the data .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that these modes are spurious . as a consequence of splitting the data , the noise level increases , masking the low - amplitude modes .",
    "an amplitude change could be another reason for finding a mode in only one half of the data . in order to check this",
    ", we compared the semi - amplitudes of the modes derived independently from the two parts of the data , but with the frequencies fixed at the values given in table [ fr30 ] .",
    "the formal rms errors of semi - amplitudes derived from the time - series data similar to our dataset are known to be underestimated by a factor of about two ( handler et al .",
    "2000 , jerzykiewicz et al .  2005",
    "; see also montgomery & odonoghue 1999 ) .",
    "if we take this into account , denoting the doubled formal rms errors of the semi - amplitudes in a giver filter @xmath87 by @xmath88 , we may conclude that the differences in semi - amplitudes between the first and the second part of our data exceed 3@xmath88 only for @xmath68 in @xmath18 ( 3.2@xmath89 ) , @xmath17 ( 4.7@xmath90 ) , and @xmath16 ( 3.2@xmath91 ) , and for @xmath71 in @xmath18 ( 4.0@xmath89 ) and @xmath17 ( 3.5@xmath90 ) . for",
    "about 70% of filter / mode combinations the differences were smaller than @xmath88 .",

    "a vast majority of the photometric observations of ec14026 stars was made without any filter .",
    "this was a compromise between the required photometric accuracy and the exposure time needed for the very short periodicities observed in these variables .",
    "however , the multicolour observations are highly desirable since they can support mode identification , a starting point for successful asteroseismology .",
    "the best examples of the multicolour observations of ec14026 stars made so far are the @xmath0 data of @xcite for v2203  cyg = kpd2109 + 4401 , the @xmath92 photometry of the same star and v429  and = hs0039 + 4302 = balloon 84041013 @xcite , four - band photometry of v338  ser @xcite , and @xmath0 observations of lm  dra = pg1618 + 563b @xcite .    since bal09 is relatively bright and mode identification is one of the main goals of our study , we observed it through wide - band filters",
    ". there is , however , a price .",
    "the residual standard deviation of our @xmath0 observations , a measure of typical accuracy of a single data point , is quite large , and amounts to 0.015 , 0.011 , 0.010 , and 0.010  mag , respectively ( table [ fr30 ] ) .",
    "fortunately , owing to the large number of the observations we gathered , the detection threshold in fourier periodograms is reasonably low , 0.81.4  mmag .",
    "the semi - amplitudes in all filters are given in table [ fr30 ] .",
    "it is worth noting that , along with the main mode in v338  ser @xcite , the @xmath68 mode has the largest amplitude of all modes known in ec14026 stars .",
    "generally , the semi - amplitudes become smaller towards longer wavelengths as the theory predicts ( see , e.g. , ramachandran et al .",
    "2004 ) . for five modes with the largest amplitudes we plot the amplitude ratios in fig .",
    "[ amplr ] .",
    "they are normalized to the @xmath18-filter amplitude .    , @xmath93 , for the five largest - amplitude modes detected in bal09 : @xmath68 , large filled circles , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 triplet , open circles , and @xmath94 , dots .",
    "error bars were calculated from formal errors of semi - amplitudes given ( table [ fr30]).,width=313 ]    the phase differences ( table [ fr30 ] ) are equal to zero within the errors for all modes .",
    "there are at least two possibilities to identify modes solely from the photometry .",
    "the first method relies on the comparison of the amplitude ratios and phase differences with those calculated from the model atmospheres for a given mode .",
    "the amplitude ratios were already used to constrain degree @xmath2 in ec14026 stars by @xcite and @xcite . however , these papers and the theoretical work of @xcite indicate that when going from shorter to longer wavelength in the optical domain , the amplitudes of low - degree ( @xmath95 2 ) @xmath10 modes for ec14026 models behave similarly .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 for the @xmath96 2 modes is hardly derivable from amplitude ratios",
    ". modes with @xmath2 = 3 and 4 are much better separated : these with @xmath2 = 3 show rather flat dependence on wavelength , while those with @xmath2 = 4 , much steeper than the @xmath96 2 modes .",
    "the amplitude ratios for five modes shown in fig .",
    "[ amplr ] exhibit similar change with wavelength as the @xmath96 2 modes .",
    "we may therefore rather safely interpret them as modes having @xmath2 equal to 0 , 1 or 2 .",
    "the other possibility for mode identification from the photometry is the best match of the observed frequencies to those calculated from the model [ @xcite is a good example ] .",
    "we make here only a rough comparison of the observed periods with those calculated in the currently available models , giving some indications as to the possible identifications . a detailed mode identification including the stability analysis of models in a wide range of input parameters needs much better modelling and is beyond the scope of this paper ; we postpone such a thorough analysis to a separate study .",
    "let us start with the assumption that the main mode , @xmath68 , is the radial fundamental one .",

    "for all models considered in previous section but model d , the values of @xmath112 provided by c02 lie between 0.01 and 0.04 , implying @xmath113 = 7.1 @xmath4 0.1  d. only for model d , the @xmath112 is higher and can reach 0.2 . in that case",
    "@xmath113 would be smaller , about 6 d. bal09 is therefore very likely a slow rotator . the 7.1-day rotation period for a star with a mass of 0.48  @xmath7 and @xmath8 = 5.51 results in the equatorial rotation velocity of 1.44 km / s .",
    "it is clear for us that bal09 is one of the most interesting targets for the future study by means of asteroseismology .",
    "the main reason for this is the coexistence of the pulsations inherent to both classes of pulsating sdb stars : the ec14026 and pg1716 + 426 stars .",
    "as far as the excited pulsations are concerned , it seems simpler than the best studied ec14026-type star v338  ser that is a fast rotator @xcite .",
    "bal09 rotates slowly and is relatively bright .",
    "it is also exceptional because of the presence of a rotationally split mode and the fact that a large number of combination frequencies are detected .",
    "in addition to a better modelling we are going to undertake in near future , the next step in our understanding of bal09 could be taken if a new photometric and spectroscopic campaign were organized .",
    "such a campaign should at least remove the 1 d@xmath27 ambiguity of some of the derived frequencies and lower the detection threshold down to 0.10.2  mmag .",
    "both these goals could be achieved if the star were observed in several observatories spread over the longitude , preferably in white light ( or very wide band filters ) .",
    "multicolour observations can support mode identification , but we showed in sect .",
    "4 that the @xmath2 value can be reliably constrained in that way only for the largest - amplitude modes",
    ". it seems , anyway , that even with accurate amplitudes it will be hard to disentangle modes with @xmath2 = 0 , 1 , and 2 , and it might be necessary to go to satellite uv to make a significant progress ( see fontaine & chayer 2004 ) .",
    "the campaign we plan should be supplemented by spectroscopic observations .",
    "some time - resolved spectroscopic observations of ec14026 stars have been already done .",
    "they were , however , usually too short in duration or badly distributed in time to result in a breakthrough in the mode identification .",
    "in case of bal09 , however , even confirming that the main frequency , @xmath68 , corresponds to the radial mode , as we suggested , would be helpful .",
    "the best way towards proper identification would come , however , from accurate matching the model frequencies to the observed ones .",
    "this is even possible with our results provided that a thorough modelling would be done . as a by - product",
    ", stellar parameters of bal09 could be obtained .",
    "as noted above , we postpone this work to a separate paper .",
