    "charging effects in the integer and fractional quantum hall regime prove to be powerful tools to probe the properties of the respective particles .",
    "these effects offer for example the possibility to measure the charge of the particles @xcite .",
    "furthermore they are discussed as an option to prove possible non - abelian statistics of the 5/2-quasiparticle with a charge of 1/4 @xcite which would make them a strong candidate to realize topological quantum computation .",
    "fundamental aspects make the underlying physics very rich .",
    "it has been shown that many other properties can be efficiently explored by operating electron interferometers and quantum dots in the quantum hall regime , e.g. to demonstrate the importance of interactions @xcite or to estimate the velocity and dephasing rate inside a quantum hall edge channel @xcite .",
    "charging effects manifest themselves in an oscillatory pattern in the dependence of the conductance on both the magnetic field and a gate - voltage which influences the size of the confined geometry @xcite .",
    "oscillations in rather small structures are usually dominated by a coulomb charging- or resonant tunneling mechanism , while large interferometers can be understood based on an aharanov - bohm mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ several different options exist to confine the current carrying particles in such a way that the above mentioned phenomena can be observed .",
    "the crucial point in all these experiments is an isolated island of compressible electron liquid , created in a two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a magnetic field .",
    "this can be done either by forming a quantum dot or an anti - dot @xcite .",
    "the experimental observations are similar in both cases .",
    "all experiments reported up to now used lithographic gates to confine the electron paths into certain geometries .",
    "the parameter space is thus spanned basically by the voltages which are applied to the gates , the source - drain bias voltage and the magnetic field .",
    "previous scanning probe experiments used predefined structures and tried to explore the underlying physics with real space resolution @xcite . in our experiments",
    "we define the potential landscape with the help of a quantum point contact ( qpc ) in combination with the biased tip of an atomic force microscope , offering an additional parameter directly influencing the geometry and thus obtaining an additional degree of freedom to tune the structure .",

    "( c ) if the tip is placed close to the qpc it blocks electron transport .",
    "( e ) if it is placed far away it has practically no influence .",
    "( d ) in an intermediate case a potential minimum can form in between the tip and the constriction . ]",
    "the experimental setup is schematically depicted in fig .",
    "we use a gaas - algaas heterostructure wafer hosting a 2deg with an electron density of @xmath3  @xmath4 and a mobility of @xmath5@xmath6/vs .",
    "the 2deg is placed 120 nm below the surface .",
    "top gates to define a qpc were patterned using electron beam lithography on top of a wet - etched hall bar structure .",
    "we apply an ac - source - drain voltage of 20  @xmath7v symmetrically with respect to ground and measure the source - drain current @xmath8 at the same time .",
    "the gold - top gates have an opening angle of 90@xmath9 and are spaced by 800 nm at the point of minimum distance ( see fig .",
    "we use the conducting tip of a home - built cryogenic scanning force microscope ( afm ) operating in a dilution refrigerator at a base temperature of 40 mk to locally perturb electron transport . for this purpose the tip is scanned at a height of 90 nm above the sample surface and a negative dc - voltage @xmath10 v is applied unless stated otherwise .",
    "this leads to a disc - shaped region of total depletion in the electron gas underneath , with a radius of about 1.2 @xmath7 m @xcite .",
    "we apply a small ac - voltage with an amplitude of 50  mv to the tip , in order to measure the transconductance @xmath0 . in most of the existing literature charging effects are directly visible as oscillations in @xmath8 @xcite . in our measurements",
    "the oscillations in @xmath8 are very subtle and superimposed on a strongly varying background .",
    "it is therefore necessary to measure @xmath0 in order to enhance their visibility .",
    "the electron temperature in the experiment is about 170 mk , and a magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the 2deg .",
    "figures 1(c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) show schematically the potential landscape which is induced by the gates and the tip . figures 1(c ) and ( e ) show the extreme cases , where the tip is so close to the qpc , that it totally blocks transport or the tip is so far away , that it has practically no influence on the recorded current .",
    "the most interesting case occurs at intermediate tip - positions shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , where two qpcs a and b form between the tip and the two top gates a and b @xcite . we can assign a different filling factor to each qpc .",
    "we name the filling factor in the center of the lithographic qpc @xmath11 and the filling factors of the qpcs which are caused by the tip @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",

    "the local filling factor @xmath16 inside the potential minimum can be tuned in a parameter space spanned by the external magnetic field @xmath17 , the gate - voltage @xmath18 , the tip voltage @xmath19 , and the tip position .",
    "the correct position for the tip has to be found , where @xmath20 and the puddle will form . in a first step we aim at finding the line where @xmath2 . for that purpose a constant voltage is applied to the qpc - gates in order to define the qpc .",
    "a voltage of @xmath21 v was chosen , which is enough to deplete the 2deg underneath @xcite but keeps @xmath11 maximal .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows an area - scan which was taken at a magnetic field of 2  t ( bulk filling factor @xmath1 ) at a position about 2  @xmath22 away from the qpc - gap with the @xmath23-axis of the scan frame oriented parallel to the qpc gap .",
    "the colors encode the transconductance @xmath0 measured with respect to the tip - voltage . to clarify the experimental geometry , the scanning gate microscopy ( sgm)-image is put into relation to the position of the lithographic gates in real space , as indicated by the green frame .",

    "1(b ) plateaus in the conductance as a function of tip position show up as black stripes .",
    "broad black stripes correspond to perfect transmission of even integer quantum hall edge states according to eq .",
    "thus we can assign specific filling factors to the black stripes as indicated in fig .",
    "the green line marks a line of symmetry where @xmath2 .",
    "this line is not perpendicular to the qpc - gap , either because the left and the right topgate have a slightly different lever arm , or because the local potential landscape is not perfectly symmetric due to irregularities in the lithographic top gates or local effects of impurities @xcite . +          now that the line where @xmath2 is found , we need to find the tip position where @xmath20 .",

    "1 ) . assuming an approximately circular shape , we can calculate a radius @xmath41=(120@xmath4210 ) nm . with the help of a capacitor model we can estimate the charging energy of the island with this radius to be @xmath43  mev .",
    "as this energy is needed to change the charge on the island by one electron , the axes @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath17 can be directly translated into energies via the peak spacings . from the full width at half maximum of the resonance peaks we can estimate the strength of the tunneling coupling @xmath44 .",

    "this gives direct access to the spatial degrees of freedom from the experimental point of view .",
    "distinct and reproducible oscillations in the measured conductance as a function of magnetic field , voltages and tip position follow a systematic behavior consistent with a resonant tunneling mechanism .",
    "the periodicity in magnetic field allows to estimate the characteristic width of this minimum to be of the order of 100 nm .",
    "this value remains constant for different filling factors , even though the tip has to be moved by the surprisingly large distance of 1 @xmath7 m , which allows us to estimate the width of one spin degenerate edge channel to be about 350 nm .",
