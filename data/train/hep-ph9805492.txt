    "in this contribution , we briefly summarize some recent progress in our ongoing systematic study  @xcite of the discovery potential of dis events induced by qcd instantons .",
    "instantons  @xcite are non - perturbative gauge field fluctuations .",
    "they describe _ tunnelling _ transitions between degenerate ground states ( vacua ) of _ different topology _ in non - abelian gauge theories like qcd . correspondingly , ( anti-)instantons carry an _ integer topologigal _",
    "charge @xmath1 , while the usual perturbation theory resides in the sector @xmath2 . unlike the latter , instantons violate _ chirality _ ( @xmath3 ) in ( massless ) qcd and the sum of baryon plus lepton number ( @xmath4 ) in qfd , in accord  @xcite with the general abj - anomaly relation",
    ". an experimental discovery of instanton ( @xmath0)-induced events would clearly be of basic significance .",
    "the deep - inelastic regime is distinguished by the fact that here hard instanton - induced processes may both be _ calculated _",
    "@xcite within instanton - perturbation theory and possibly _ detected experimentally _  @xcite . as a key feature",
    "we have recently shown  @xcite , that in dis the generic hard scale @xmath5 cuts off instantons with _ large size _",
    "@xmath6 , over which we have no control theoretically .",
    "there has been much recent activity in the lattice community to `` measure '' topological fluctuations in _ lattice simulations _",
    "@xcite of qcd .",
    "being independent of perturbation theory , such simulations provide `` snapshots '' of the qcd vacuum including all possible non - perturbative features like instantons .",
    "they also provide crucial support for important prerequisites of our calculations in dis , like the validity of @xmath0-perturbation theory and the dilute @xmath0-gas approximation for _ small _ instantons of size @xmath7 .",
    "as one main point of this paper ( sect .",
    "2 ) , these lattice constraints will be exploited and translated into a `` fiducial '' kinematical region for our predictions of the instanton - induced dis cross - section based on @xmath0-perturbation theory . in sect .",
    "3 we display the finalized calculations of the various instanton - induced cross - sections  @xcite .",
    "the essential new aspect here is the strong reduction of the residual dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath8 resulting from a recalculation based on improved instanton densities  @xcite , which are renormalization group ( rg ) invariant at the 2-loop level .",
    "the leading instanton ( i)-induced process in the dis regime of @xmath9 scattering is displayed in fig.1 .",
    "the non - trivial _ topology _ of instantons is reflected in a violation of _ chirality _ by @xmath10 , in accord  @xcite with the general abj - anomaly relation ( while in pqcd always @xmath11 ) .",
    "the dashed box emphasizes the so - called instanton-_subprocess _ with its own bjorken variables , @xmath12    the cross - section of interest may be shown  @xcite to exhibit a convolution - type structure , consisting of a smooth , calculable `` flux factor '' @xmath13 from the the @xmath14 vertex , and the @xmath0-subprocess total cross - section @xmath15 , containing the essential instanton dynamics .",
    "we have evaluated the latter  @xcite by means of the optical theorem and the so - called @xmath16-valley approximation  @xcite for the relevant @xmath17 forward elastic scattering amplitude in the @xmath16 background .",
    "this method resums the exponentiating final state gluons in form of the known valley action @xmath18 and reproduces standard @xmath0-perturbation theory at larger @xmath16 separation @xmath19 .",
    "corresponding to the symmetries of the theory , the instanton calculus introduces at the classical level certain ( undetermined ) `` collective coordinates '' like the @xmath20-size parameters @xmath21 and the @xmath16 distance @xmath22 ( in units of the size ) .",
    "observables like @xmath15 , must be independent thereof and thus involve integrations over all collective coordinates . hence , denoting the _ density _ of @xmath20 s by @xmath23 ( see eq.([density ] ) ) , we have generically , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a convenient conformally invariant variable characterizing the @xmath16 distance . in eq.([sigma ] ) , the crucial exponential cut - off  @xcite @xmath26 is responsible for the _ finiteness _ of the @xmath27 integrations . in addition , it causes the integrals ( [ sigma ] ) to be dominated by a _",
    "single , calculable _",
    "( saddle ) point ( @xmath28 ) , in _ one - to - one _ relation to the conjugate momentum variables ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "this effective one - to - one mapping of the conjugate @xmath0-variables allows for the following important strategy : we may determine _ quantitatively _ the range of validity of @xmath0-perturbation theory and the dilute @xmath0-gas approximation in the instanton collective coordinates ( @xmath30 ) from recent ( non - perturbative ) lattice simulations of qcd and translate the resulting constraints via the mentioned one - to - one relations into a `` fiducial '' kinematical region ( @xmath31 ) at hera ! experimentally",
    ", these cuts must be implemented via a ( @xmath32 ) reconstruction from the final state topology  @xcite , while theoretically , they are incorporated into our @xmath0-event generator  @xcite `` qcdins 1.6.0 '' and the resulting prediction of @xmath33 ( see sect.3 ) .    in lattice simulations 4d - euclidean space - time is made discrete , e.g. in case of the `` data '' from the ukqcd collaboration  @xcite which we shall use here ,    [ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]     in terms of the qcd @xmath34-function coefficients : @xmath35 .",
    "this power law @xmath36 of @xmath0-perturbation theory is confronted in fig.2(top ) with recent lattice `` data '' , which strongly suggests @xmath0-perturbation theory to be valid for @xmath37 fm .",
    "next , consider the square of the total topological charge , @xmath38 along with the total number of charges @xmath39 . for",
    "a _ dilute gas _ , the number fluctuations are _ poissonian _ and correlations among the @xmath40 and @xmath41 distributions absent , implying @xmath42 , or @xmath43 . from fig.2(bottom ) , it is apparent that this relation characterizing the validity of the dilute @xmath0-gas approximation , is well satisfied for sufficiently _ small _ instantons !",
    "again , we find @xmath44 fm , quite independent of the number of cooling sweeps . for increasing @xmath45 fm ,",
    "the ratio @xmath46 rapidly and strongly deviates from one .",
    "crucial information about a second instanton parameter of interest , the average @xmath16 distance @xmath47 , may be obtained as well from the lattice @xcite .",
    "actually , the ratio  @xcite @xmath48 has good stability against `` cooling '' , from which we shall take @xmath49 as a reasonable lower limit for our @xmath0-perturbative dis calculations .",
    "finally , the `` fiducial '' kinematical region for our cross - section predictions in dis is found from lattice constraints and the discussed saddle - point translation as @xmath50",
    "we have achieved great progress in stability by using the _ 2-loop rg invariant _ form of the @xmath0-density @xmath51 from eq.([density ] ) and table1 in a recalculation of the @xmath0-subprocess cross - sections  @xcite : the residual dependence on the renormalization scale @xmath8 turns out to be _ strongly reduced _ ( fig.3 ) . as `` best '' scheme we use @xmath52 throughout , for which @xmath53 .",
    "the quantitative calculations of @xmath54    ( fig.4 ) nicely illustrate the qualitative arguments from sect.2 , that the @xmath55 dependence probes the effective instanton _ size @xmath56 _ ( top ) , while the @xmath57 dependence maps the @xmath16 _ distance @xmath58 _ in units of the @xmath0-size @xmath56 ( bottom ) .",
    "fig.5 displays the finalized @xmath0-induced cross - section at hera , as function of the cuts @xmath59 and @xmath60 in leading semi - classical approximation , as obtained with the new release `` qcdins 1.6.0 '' of our @xmath0-event generator .    for the minimal cuts ( [ fiducial ] ) extracted from lattice simulations , we specifically obtain @xmath61 in view of the fact that the cross - section varies strongly as a function of the ( @xmath62 ) cuts , the constraints from lattice simulations are extremely valuable for making concrete predictions .    99 a. ringwald and f. schrempp , hep - ph/9411217 , in : proc .",
