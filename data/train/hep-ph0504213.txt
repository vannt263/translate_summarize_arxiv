    "rare @xmath1 meson decays , induced by flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) @xmath2 transitions provide a promising ground for testing the gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these decays which are forbidden in the sm at tree level , occur at loop level and allow us to check the prediction of the theory at quantum level .",
    "moreover , these decays are also quite sensitive to the existence of new physics beyond the sm , since loops with new particles can give contribution to these decays .",
    "the new physics effects in rare decays can appear in two ways ; one via modification of the existing wilson coefficients in the sm , or through the introduction of some new operators with new coefficients .",
    "theoretical study of the @xmath3 decays are relatively more clean compared to their exclusive counterparts , since they are not spoiled by nonperturbative long distance effects , while the corresponding exclusive channels are easier to measure experimentally .",
    "some of the most important exclusive fcnc decays are @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "the latter provides potentially a very rich set of experimental observables , such as , lepton pair forward ",
    "backward ( fb ) asymmetry , lepton polarizations , etc .",
    "various kinematical distributions of such processes as @xmath6 @xcite , @xmath7 @xcite , @xmath8 @xcite and @xmath9 @xcite have already been studied .",
    "study of the forward ",
    "backward asymmetry , single polarization asymmetry , etc .",
    ", which are experimentally measurable quantities , is an efficient approach that have been already been investigated in detail for the @xmath6 decay in @xcite in fitting the parameters of the sm and put constraints on new physics .",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that some of the single lepton polarization asymmetries might be quite small to be observed and might nor provide sufficient number of observables in checking the structure of the effective hamiltonian . in @xcite",
    "the maximum number of independent observables are constructed by taking both lepton polarizations into account simultaneously .",
    "it is clear that , measurement of many more observables which would be useful in further improvement of the parameters of the sm probing new physics beyond the sm .",
    "it should be noted here that both lepton polarizations in the @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays are studied in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "as has already been noted , one efficient way of establishing new physics effects is studying forward ",
    "backward asymmetry in semileptonic @xmath12 decay , since , @xmath13 vanishes at specific values of the dilepton invariant mass , and more essential than that , this zero position of @xmath13 is known to be practically free of hadronic uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the decays of @xmath1 mesons induced by the @xmath14 transition are promising in looking for cp violation since the ckm factors @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the sm are all of the same order .",
    "for this reason cp violation is much more considerable in the decays induced by @xmath18 transition .",
    "so , study of the exclusive decays @xmath19 are quite promising for the confirmation of the cp violation and these decays have extensively been investigated in the sm @xcite and beyond @xcite .    the aim of the present work is studying the polarized forward  backward asymmetry in the exclusive @xmath20 decay using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , including all possible forms of interactions . here",
    "we would like to remind the reader that the influence of new wilson coefficients on various kinematical variables , such as branching ratios , lepton pair forward ",
    "backward asymmetries and single lepton polarization asymmetries for the inclusive @xmath21 decays ( see first references in @xcite ) and exclusive @xmath22 @xcite and pure leptonic @xmath23 decays @xcite have been studied comprehensively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , using a general form of the effective hamiltonian , we obtain the matrix element in terms of the form factors of the @xmath24 transition . in section 3",
    "we derive the analytical results for the polarized forward  backward asymmetry .",
    "last section is devoted to the numerical analysis , discussion and conclusions .",
    "in this section we calculate the double lepton polarizations using a general form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath20 process is governed by @xmath14 transition at quark level .",
    "the matrix element for the @xmath14 can be written in terms of the twelve model independent four  fermi interactions in the following form : [ e6901 ] h_eff v_tdv_tb^\\ { c_sl |d i _ l b |^+ c_br |d i _ r b |^ + c_ll^tot |d_l _ b_l |_l ^_l + c_lr^tot |d_l _ b_l |_r ^_r + c_rl |d_r _ b_r    c_rr |d_r _ b_r |_r ^_r + c_lrlr |d_l b_r |_l _ r + c_rllr",

    "( 2 ) ) , and being quite sensitive to the rest of the remaining new wilson coefficients .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the sign of @xmath102 is negative ( positive ) in region i ( region ii ) for all values of @xmath27 .    figs .",

    "we observe from fig .",
    "( 3 ) that , except scalar interactions , @xmath107 is quite sensitive to the existence of the remaining ones . more important than that",
    "is the presence of regions of the new wilson coefficients where @xmath107 changes its sign , while in the sm case the sign of the @xmath107 is never switched .",
    "so , study of the magnitude and sign of @xmath108 can serve as a good test for looking new physics beyond the sm . in region ii , @xmath107 is strongly dependent only on tensor interactions ( see fig . ( 4 ) ) .",

    "we observe from these figures that @xmath111 exhibits strong dependence only on tensor interactions , and especially there is a region of @xmath45 where @xmath112 exceeds the sm prediction more than one order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , when @xmath105 and @xmath45 is negative ( positive ) the sign of @xmath109 is positive ( negative ) .",

    "all remaining forward ",

    "( 8) depicts that @xmath107 is strongly dependent on tensor interactions , as well as on vector interactions with the coefficients @xmath34 and @xmath35 when they get positive values .",
    "we observe from fig .",
    "( 9 ) that , @xmath118 both exhibit strong dependence on all new wilson coefficients . as can easily be observed from fig .",
    "( 10 ) , @xmath116 both are very sensitive to the presence of tensor and scalar interactions .",
    "it follows from these results that few of the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetries show considerable departure from the sm predictions and these ones are strongly dependent on different types of interactions .",
    "hence , the study of these quantities can play crucial role in establishing new physics beyond the sm .    at the end of this section",
    ", we would like to discuss the following problem .",
    "it is clear that the existence of new physics can more easily be checked through branching ratio measurements . in this connection there",
    "follows the question : could there be a situation in which the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm result , while polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry does not ? in order to answer this question we study the correlation between the @xmath119 and the branching ratio @xmath120 .",
    "we can briefly summarize the results of our numerical analysis as follows : as far as @xmath103 decay is concerned , except for a very narrow region of @xmath35 , such a region is absent for all new wilson coefficients for the asymmetries @xmath102 , @xmath107 and @xmath121 .",
    "the @xmath113 decay is more informative for this aim . in figs . (",
    "11 ) and ( 12 ) we present the dependence of @xmath114 and @xmath107 on the branching ratio .",
    "it follows from these figures that , there indeed exists certain regions of @xmath27 for which the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry differs from the sm prediction , while the branching ratio coincides with that of the sm result .",
    "we also note that , such a region exists for the asymmetries @xmath116 as well , only for the tensor interaction .    in conclusion , in this work",
    "we investigate the forward  backward asymmetries when both leptons are polarized , using a general , model independent form of the effective hamiltonian .",
    "we see that the study of the zero position of @xmath102 can give unambiguous conformation of the new physics beyond the sm , since when new physics effects are taken into account , the results are shifted with respect to their zero positions in the sm .",
    "we also find out that the polarized @xmath13 is quite sensitive to the existence of some of the new wilson coefficients .",
    "we see that there exist certain regions of some of the new wilson coefficients for which , only study of the polarized forward ",
    "backward asymmetry gives invaluable information in establishing new physics beyond the sm .",
