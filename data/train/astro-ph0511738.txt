    "it is by now an established fact that the universe accelerates faster than previously anticipated @xcite . hence some hitherto neglected ingredient ( in general called dark energy )",
    "has to be responsible for this new phenomenon . to account for this phenomenon",
    "we can introduce new physics in terms of a scalar field @xcite or modify three expressions in einstein s equations which are often equivalent to a specific model with a scalar field .",
    "the three possibilities to account for the new physics are : the einstein tensor , the energy - momentum tensor ( this is to say , the energy momentum tensor of a fluid gets modified by the inclusion of other components , @xcite or the equation of state @xcite ) .",
    "the first possibility encompasses a positive cosmological constant @xmath0 and higher order gravity with a more complicated einstein - hilbert action @xcite . in the the present work we choose to work with the cosmological constant as the simplest explanation for the acceleration of the universe .",
    "we shall put forward the question if such a cosmological model has an influence on astrophysical structures .",
    "we shall use equilibria concepts like hydrostatic equilibrium and virial equations to see how relatively low density astrophysical matter of different shapes behaves in a fast expanding universe . anticipating the results",
    ", we can say that indeed there are some interesting effects .",
    "often it is assumed that @xmath0 does not have any effect on astrophysical processes which take place at scales different from the cosmological ones .",
    "indeed , looking at the scales set by @xmath0 , this assumption seems to be justified at the first glance .",
    "the scales set by the cosmological constant are of truly cosmological order of magnitude @xcite ) .",
    "the density scale is set by @xmath1 with @xmath2 . the length scale , @xmath3 is of the order of the hubble radius while the mass scale @xmath4 reaches up to the value of the mass of the universe .",
    "these scales constitute the so - called coincidence problem , namely the question as to why we should live exactly at an epoch where the scales of the cosmological constant are also the scales of the universe .",
    "neither was it so in the past nor will it be so in the future when the universe expands further .",
    "the only astrophysical structures which match these scales are superclusters whose densities are indeed of the order of magnitude of @xmath5",
    ". indeed , here we can almost be sure that the cosmological constant is of relevance @xcite .",
    "however , probing into astrophysical consequences of the cosmological constant of other , smaller and denser structures like clusters of galaxies or even galaxies themselves , would look a hopeless undertaking unless we find circumstances where the effect of @xmath0 ( which in the very principle is present ) gets enhanced .",
    "this can indeed happen through various mechanisms .",
    "for instance , in a problem where @xmath6 combines with a much smaller length scale , say @xmath7 , the effects can be sometimes expressed as @xmath8 . in consequence , the observable in which this expression enters gets affected by @xmath0 in a way which is important at much smaller scales than @xmath6 .",
    "a concrete example is the schwarzschild - de sitter metric where we find the parameter @xmath6 together with the much smaller length scale of the schwarzschild radius @xmath9 .",
    "these two conspire in the form @xmath10 to define the largest extension of bound orbits as explained in the text and in @xcite .",
    "we will discuss a very similar combination which emerges from the virial theorem defining the largest possible virialized structure with a given mass .",
    "another possibility to enhance the effect of the cosmological constant is to consider non - spherical objects .",
    "it then often happens that the effect of @xmath0 becomes @xmath11 where @xmath12 are two different length scales of a flattened object like a disk or an ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "this indeed happens for many astrophysical quantities , among other the critical mass , the angular velocity and the temperature ( mean velocity of the components of the large structure ) which we will discuss in the present paper .",
    "finally , we can vary a dimensional variable to see if this enhances the effect of the cosmological constant . as an example",
    "let us quote the polytropic index @xmath13 in the equation of state entering also the lane - emden equation .",
    "it is known that with growing @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) the object described by this equation of state does not have a well - defined radius as the density goes only asymptotically to zero .",
    "we will show that this pattern of behaviour becomes more dominant with @xmath15 .    of course",
    ", all these effects become stronger the more diluted the mass conglomeration is .",
    "the superclusters are certainly the best candidates if we look for astrophysical effects of the cosmological constant . as a matter of fact",
    ", they do not seem to be virialized due to the extreme low density and their pancake structure @xcite where the effect of flatness mentioned above becomes powerful @xcite .",
    "for the next structure , the clusters of galaxies ( or groups of galaxies ) with densities between one and three orders of magnitude above the critical density @xcite , we would need one of the enhancing factors discussed above to see an appreciable effect of @xmath0 .",
    "this is possible in various ways as shown below .",
    "galaxy clusters can have various forms , among others oblate and prolate @xcite . and",
    "what is more , they can even rotate @xcite .",
    "we will show an explicit effect of @xmath0 on their angular velocity and temperature in case the angular velocity is zero .",
    "since the effect of large eccentricity is larger for prolate than for oblate ellipsoids , it is comforting to know that clusters can assume a prolate shape .",
    "for low - density galaxies like the low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies whose density is roughly four orders of magnitude above the critical density @xcite , we still find some effects . for @xmath16 and @xmath17 the solution of the lane - emden equation @xcite",
    "is very often used as a phenomenologically valid description of the density profile ( called also plummer s law @xcite .",
    "this is still possible as @xmath18 as @xmath19 .",
    "however , this property vanishes for low - density galaxies and the @xmath16 case not only does not have a well - defined radius , its solution does not vanish asymptotically which thus rendering it unphysical .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we will briefly review the general form of virial theorem including pressure , magnetic fields and , of course , the cosmological constant . here",
    "we will also discuss some general results regarding @xmath0 . in the third section",
    "we will specialize on spherical configurations .",
    "we will show how @xmath0 sets the scale of a maximal virial radius and compare it to a result from the schwarzschild - de sitter metric .",
    "we will also solve the lane - emden equation numerically and analytically ( for the polytropic index @xmath20 ) . in the fourth section",
    "we will discuss non - spherical configurations .",
    "first , we will show how @xmath0 affects the angular velocity of spheroids .",
    "in addition , we will discuss the effects of @xmath0 for the critical mass , mean velocity and mean rotational velocity too .",
    "the fifth section is devoted to small oscillations around equilibrium .",
    "the cosmological constant enters the equations of newtonian limit as a consequence of its appearance in the einstein field equations .",
    "it is through this weak field limit approximation that @xmath0 enters also in the equations describing the structure of astrophysical configurations .",
    "it is interesting to note that all variables to be found in the virial equations , are also present in the poisson equation of the newtonian limit .",
    "however , this is not always the reason why these terms enter the virial equations , at least in the first order .",
    "the poisson equation for a self - gravitating system modeled as an ideal fluid is written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the pressure and @xmath23 is the electromagnetic energy density .",
    "the solution of ( [ poisson ] ) at the zeroth order of @xmath24 ( from now on we set @xmath25 ) is written as @xmath26 where the dots stand for the correction terms that appear because the boundary conditions are now set at a finite distance @xcite .",
    "these terms can be usually neglected .",
    "the cosmological constant @xmath27 contributes to the expansion of the universe .",
    "this fact remains partly valid in the newtonian limit where @xmath0 gives us an _",
    "external force_. this defines the so - called ( non - relativistic ) newton - hooke spacetime @xcite .",
    "+      the second order tensor virial equation can be derived in different ways : from a statistical point of view through the collisionless boltzmann equation , from a variational principle or by direct differentiation of the moment of inertia tensor @xmath28 in the following we use the statistical approach @xcite which also allows to derive higher order virial equations ( for instance , the first order virial equation refers to the motion of the center of mass ) . in this context , from boltzmann s equation one can derive the equation for momentum conservation ( euler s equation ) written for a self gravitating system influenced by a magnetic field as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the gravitational potential given by ( [ psolution ] ) ( which includes @xmath0 ) and @xmath31 is the pressure tensor , @xmath22 is the pressure and @xmath32 its traceless part .",
    "equations ( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) together with an equation of state @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is the entropy ) complete the description of a self gravitating fluid . by taking exterior products of @xmath35 with euler s equation and integrating over the volume of the system one obtains the second order virial equation as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the kinetic energy tensor and @xmath38 is a generalized potential energy tensor which contains the contribution from the gravitational potential energy tensor @xmath39 and the contributions of magnetic field through @xmath40 together with @xmath41{\\text{d}}s_{j},\\hspace{0.5cm}{\\mathcal{b}}_{ik}=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{v}{b_{i}}{b_{k}}\\,{{\\text{d}}^{3}r},\\hspace{0.5cm}{\\mathcal{b}}={\\rm tr}({{\\mathcal{b}}_{ik}}).\\ ] ] a very useful version of the virial equation can be derived by assuming an isotropic pressure tensor and taking the trace in ( [ virotro ] ) . this way we get the scalar @xmath0-virial equation @xmath42 where the total kinetic energy is written as @xmath43",
    "the equilibrium condition is reached for @xmath44 .",
    "this gives us the general @xmath0-virial theorem @xmath45 for rotating configurations with constant angular velocity , the kinetic term is modified as in the standard way as @xmath46 with @xmath47 the rotational kinetic energy tensor and @xmath37 is referred to motions observed from the rotating reference frame .",
    "the @xmath0-virial theorem has been used in different contexts in @xcite . in the present work we will extend these studies .",
    "+      the tensor virial equation is widely used in many astrophysical applications .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 provides a new way to study effects of the cosmological constant ( parameters , in general ) on astrophysical objects .",
    "the outcome depends essentially on two factors : the geometry of the configuration and the density profile .",
    "we will explore the spherical geometry for both constant and varying density profiles and study some effects for non spherical geometry with constant density .",
    "the consequences that can be derived from the @xmath0-virial theorem can be classified in two categories .",
    "the first one puts an upper bound on the cosmological constant or alternatively a lower bound on density of objects in gravitational equilibrium .",
    "provided these bounds are satisfied , we can also study in the second step the effects of @xmath0 on other properties of the astrophysical configurations like rotation , small oscillations etc .",
    "+ the first simple consequence of the virial equation emerges if we require the system to satisfy ( [ vt ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath48 implies an upper bound on the vacuum energy density @xmath49 all systems in equilibrium have to satisfy ( [ ineq0 ] ) .",
    "note that the right hand side of this expression is a function of both the density and the geometry of the system .",
    "hence , we must expect different bounds for different geometries and density profiles .",
    "for instance , if we assume a constant density and @xmath50 , we can define @xmath51 and @xmath52 through @xmath53 ) becomes @xmath54 the factor @xmath55 which is only a function of the geometry ( if we neglect the contribution of magnetic fields ) , will appear in many places in the paper .",
    "its relevance lies in the fact that it enhances the effect of the cosmological constant for geometries far from spherical symmetry when @xmath56 is large .",
    "a useful generalization can be done for situations in which we use the tensor form of the virial equation , namely @xmath57 finally , a curious equation can be derived by eliminating @xmath0 from the tensor virial equations : @xmath58 although @xmath0 does not enter this equation , ( [ curious ] ) is only valid if the denominator is non - zero as is the case with @xmath15 . in sect .",
    "4 we will use this equality to infer a relation between the geometry and rotational velocity of an ellipsoid .",
    "having discussed the general form of the virial theorem , we will discuss now the effects of @xmath0 and set @xmath59 .",
    "the tensor virial equation is trivially satisfied for spherically symmetric configuration without a magnetic field , since @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , in this section we use only the scalar form of ( [ virotro ] ) .",
    "explicit expressions can be derived in the spherical case with constant density , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 . in this case",
    "the ratio @xmath65 does not get enhanced much by the geometrical factor @xmath55 .",
    "worth mentioning is the result from general relativity .",
    "there the upper bound for the cosmological constant comes out as @xmath66 @xcite where @xmath67 is the mean density defined by @xmath68 .",
    "this bound is derived not only from newtonian astrophysics , but also from a general relativistic context via the tolmann - oppenheimer - volkoff equation @xcite for hydrostatic equilibrium of compact objects @xcite .",
    "another relevant effect of the cosmological constant is the existence of a maximal virial radius of a spherical configuration which can be calculated from the @xmath0-virial equation . using the expressions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 given before , equation ( [ scalar1 ] ) yields as a cubic equation for the virial radius @xmath71 @xmath72 here we introduced the dimensionless temperature @xmath73 as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the mass of the average member of the configuration , @xmath76 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath77 is the temperature and @xmath78 is defined by @xmath79 the length scale @xmath80 is set by the the cosmological constant as @xmath81 @xmath82 is dimensionless hubble parameter @xcite and @xmath83 is the density parameter at the present time .",
    "the positive real root of equation ( [ cubic ] ) is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 , is radius for the configuration at @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 the radius @xmath85 is the largest radius that a spherical homogeneous cloud may have in virial equilibrium ( i.e , satisfying ( [ vt ] ) ) .",
    "the function @xmath90 can be obtained from the solution of the cubic equation and reads ( clarified in the appendix a ) @xmath91.\\ ] ] figure 1 shows the behavior of @xmath90 for different values of @xmath88 .",
    "we see that the increase of the temperature implies a decrease of the effects of @xmath0 which can be easily checked if we solve @xmath71 from the virial theorem with @xmath17 and compare it to the approximation @xmath92 in ( [ rvir ] ) : @xmath93 we can consider ( [ rvir ] ) as a radius - temperature relation for a fixed mass applied on astrophysical structures in a single state of equilibrium in the presence of @xmath0 .",
    "that is , given @xmath88 and @xmath73 we calculate the radius .",
    "but we can adopt another point of view for this relation .",
    "imagine a spherical configuration characterized by a constant mass @xmath94 .",
    "in analogy to a thermodynamical reversible process , the configuration may pass from one state of virial equilibrium to another following the curve @xmath95 , that is , satisfying the condition @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , there must be some final temperature @xmath96 when this process ends since the temperature can not increase indefinitely .",
    "but of course since the virial equations are not dynamical we can not know which stage is the final one .",
    "if we _ assume _ that the effects of @xmath0 are negligible when @xmath97 , then using eqs ( [ delta ] ) and ( [ dapp ] ) we get @xmath98 this is an equation for the temperature @xmath99 @xmath100 for a hydrogen cloud ( @xmath101 ) , we then write the mass - temperature relation using eqs.([rl ] ) and ( [ x ] ) as @xmath102 note that this expression maintains the same dependence of the standard mass - temperature relation derived from the virial theorem , i.e , @xmath103 ( see @xcite or equation ( [ mvel2 ] ) of this paper ) .",
    "however the meaning of ( [ temperature3 ] ) is different from that of typical mass temperature relations since ( [ temperature3 ] ) is associated to the temperature that a system acquires in the final stage after after going through some _",
    "reversible processes _ which took the system through successive states of virial equilibrium with constant mass from a radius @xmath85 to a radius @xmath104 or vice versa . on the other hand , the mass - temperature relation like eq .",
    "( [ mvel2 ] ) of this paper relates the temperature of any configuration in equilibrium with its observed mass at constant density . in that context",
    "one considers only one equilibrium state and the cosmological constant enters just as corrections .        as a final remark on eq .",
    "( [ rvir ] ) , we discuss a result which formally coincides with the virial radius @xmath85 derived from the schwarszchild de - sitter spacetime @xcite , but whose physical meaning is quite different .",
    "the schwarzschild - de sitter metric takes the form @xmath105 now in contrast to ( [ rs ] ) we have @xmath106 with @xmath75 the mass of the object giving rise to the schwarzschild - de sitter metric ( in eq .",
    "( [ rs ] ) @xmath94 is the mass of the total conglomeration whereas here we consider @xmath75 as the mass of its average member ) . choosing the affine parameter as the proper time",
    "@xmath107 the equation of motion of a test - body can be cast in a form similar to the corresponding equations from non - relativistic classical mechanics .",
    "@xmath108 where @xmath109 is a conserved quantity and @xmath110 is the effective potential , defined by @xmath111 for simplicity we are have chosen here the angular momentum @xmath112 to be zero . with @xmath112 zero or not",
    ", @xmath110 displays a local maximum below zero due to @xmath15 forming a potential barrier .",
    "this is to say , the standard local minimum where we find all the bounded orbits is now followed by a local maximum after which @xmath110 goes to @xmath113 . with @xmath17 this",
    "function approaches zero asymptotically .",
    "one is immediately tempted to say that this barrier will occur at cosmological distances .",
    "this is not the case and one calculates @xmath114 in other words , the combination of the large scale @xmath6 with the small scale @xmath115 gives us a distance of astrophysical relevance , namely @xmath116 .",
    "its relevance lies in te fact that beyond @xmath116 there are no bound orbits . indeed , with @xmath75 the solar mass",
    ", @xmath116 is of the order of a globular cluster extension ( @xmath117 pc ) ; with @xmath75 as the mass of globular cluster , @xmath116 comes out to be of the order of the size of a galaxy ( @xmath118 kpc ) , and finally taking @xmath75 to be the mass of a galaxy , @xmath116 gives the right length scale of a galaxy cluster ( @xmath119 mpc ) .",
    "certainly , the value of the extension of a large astrophysical body is the result of a multi - body interaction .",
    "but with the actual values of @xmath116 , it appears as if the _ length scale _ ( we emphasize that we are concerned hare about scales and not precise numbers ) of an astrophysical conglomeration is approximately @xmath116 , which apparently means that this scale does not change drastrically when going from a two body problem to a multi - body calculation .",
    "this makes sense if the object under consideration is not too dense .",
    "we can now say that whereas @xmath94 in @xmath85 ( via @xmath78 ) is the mass of the object , @xmath75 in eq .",
    "( [ sca2 ] ) is the mass of its members .",
    "clearly , we have @xmath120 , but both scales are of astrophysical order of magnitude . a result related to ( [ rvir2 ] ) derived in the framework of general relativity",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "the examination of configurations with non - constant densities can be done in two directions . knowing the density profile @xmath121",
    ", we can set up the virial equation and evaluate the equilibrium conditions from the inequality ( [ ineq0 ] ) . in this picture , the effects of @xmath0 are included in the solution for the potential @xmath30 as in eq .",

    "it is important to notice that in this picture the expected effects of @xmath0 are to be found in the behavior of the density profile since now eq .",
    "( [ le ] ) implies that its solution is also function of the parameter @xmath131 .",

    "this is due to the fact that @xmath0 sets a scale for length .",
    "however , this does not mean that @xmath134 will be always of the order @xmath6 as @xmath0 is also contained in the expression in the square brackets in eq .",
    "( [ radius ] ) .",
    "we will show this below in a concrete example . since @xmath0 is a new constant scale the lane - emden equation loses some of its scaling properties as explained in @xcite .",

    "( [ le ] ) for the second equality .",
    "the total mass is then obtained by evaluating the last expression at @xmath136 .",
    "as expected , the mass increases because the newtonian gravity has to be stronger in order for the configuration to be in equilibrium with @xmath137 .",

    "one might be tempted to claim that the radius of the configuration could be defined in these situations as the position where @xmath140 has its first minimum , but as can be seen for @xmath141 such a radius would be smaller than the radius with @xmath142 which contradicts the behaviour shown for the other solutions where @xmath143 . as already mentioned above this",
    "is the correct hierarchy between the radii because large @xmath144 gives rise to a large external force pulling at the matter .",
    "the numerical solutions show that for relatively large values of @xmath131 , only @xmath138 has a well defined radius . in this case",

    "<S> using the scalar and tensor virial equations , the lane - emden equation expressing the hydrostatic equilibrium and small oscillations around the equilibrium , we show how the cosmological constant @xmath0 affects various astrophysical quantities important for large matter conglomeration in the universe . among others we examine the effect of @xmath0 on the polytropic equation of state for spherically symmetric objects and </S>",

    "<S> we calculate the angular velocity for non - spherical oblate configurations which demonstrates a clear effect of @xmath0 on high eccentricity objects . </S>",
    "<S> we show that for oblate as well as prolate ellipsoids the cosmological constant influences the critical mass and the temperature of the astrophysical object . these and other results show that the effect of @xmath0 is large for flat astrophysical bodies .    _ keywords : large - scale structure of universe . </S>",
