    "the galaxy luminosity function , or number density of galaxies as a function of their luminosity , is a fundamental property of the galaxy distribution , as it provides information on how visible matter is distributed among galaxies of various luminosities at a given epoch .",
    "therefore , its evolution can be used to constrain models of galaxy evolution and structure formation @xcite . in order to set tight constraints on these models",
    ", one would ideally divide galaxies into a variety of subgroups and derive independent luminosity functions that are known to vary significantly with respect to several physical parameters such as redshift , color , galaxy type , star formation rate , etc . with the advent of very large and deep galaxy surveys ,",
    "this has become possible , leading to a large number of works .",
    "however , in order to benefit from large , homogeneous and complete samples , in most cases one has to rely only on the photometric information with at most a partial spectroscopic coverage .    while the local luminosity function has been extensively studied due to numerous spectroscopic surveys carried out over the years @xcite , probing its evolution to high redshifts still represents a challenge . one possible way of doing that is to take advantage of the recent multi - band photometric surveys , such as the canada - france - hawaii telescope legacy survey ( cfhtls ) , and",
    "use the photometric redshift technique to estimate distances .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that this is in fact possible , at least using the redshift bins here adopted , yielding reliable results .",
    "this is demonstrated using the vimos vlt deep survey ( vvds ) data and one of the deep fields of cfhtls .",
    "based on this finding we use all cfhtls deep fields to compute a combined luminosity function and estimate the cosmic variance on their fitted schechter parameters at different redshifts .",
    "finally , we use the information provided by the template fitting routine used to estimate the photometric redshift to split the sample into galaxy types , and compare with the few results available in the literature .",
    "this is relevant to investigate how reliable this approach can be to explore the data that will eventually become public for surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des ) and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) .    in section [ lfmethod ] of this paper ,",
    "the details on the method used to compute the luminosity function are discussed .",
    "the data used is briefly described in section [ data_desc ] . in section [ lf_spec_samp ] ,",
    "the results of the comparison of the luminosity functions computed using spectroscopic and photometric redshifts are presented . in this section",
    "we also show the evolution of the luminosity function derived for the combined sample comprising all galaxies and split into different galaxy types , which are then compared with the results of other authors .",
    "we present a summary of our conclusions in section [ concl ] .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the cosmology used is @xmath8 , @xmath9 and results are expressed in terms of @xmath10 .",
    "the luminosity function @xmath11 , expressing the number of galaxies with absolute magnitudes in the interval @xmath12 and @xmath13 per unit volume , is calculated in intervals of redshift using the @xmath14 method @xcite .",
    "thus a galaxy of absolute magnitude @xmath12 at redshift @xmath15 contributes to the luminosity function with weight @xmath14 , where @xmath16 is the maximum volume within which the galaxy apparent magnitude is found between the catalog apparent magnitude limits ( also bounded by the redshift bin limits ) .",
    "the absolute magnitudes are calculated as : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the apparent magnitude of the galaxy ; the luminosity distance is given by @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the comoving distance in @xmath21 ; @xmath22 is the @xmath22-correction for the shift of the observed spectrum with relation to rest frame reference band wavelength and width . in this work",
    "we deal only with the @xmath23-band in the ab photometric system , so @xmath12 stands for @xmath24 and no correction for intrinsic dust reddening was performed .",
    "our source for @xmath22-corrections is the code le phare , which was run with spectral energy distributions ( seds ) from @xcite with the addition of 8 seds from @xcite .",
    "these @xmath22-corrections are shown in figure [ kcorr ] , and they are calculated for each galaxy based on the best fitting sed .    in the following analysis , we fit the usual @xcite function :    @xmath25    where @xmath2 is the characteristic absolute magnitude and @xmath6 is the normalization factor .",
    "fits for the schechter function were performed by a least square method using the marquardt - levenberg algorithm with @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 as free parameters .",
    "in this work , we used photometric data from the four deep fields of the cfhtls from observations made with the megacam camera at the cfht .",
    "each field ( d1 , d2 , d3 and d4 ) covers @xmath27 square degree and was observed in the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath23 , and @xmath31 bands ( table [ infocfhtls ] presents general information ) .",
    "the cfhtls - d1 field is particularly interesting for this work since it has both photometric and spectroscopic observations from vvds .",
    "photometry in the vvds was carried out using @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 filters and additional photometric data in the @xmath36 and @xmath22 bands are available from .",
    "the spectra were obtained with the vimos spectrograph at the vlt , for objects selected in the range @xmath37 , yielding a total of 6582 galaxies .",
    "we used only good quality spectroscopic redshifts ( quality flags 2 , 3 and 4 ) , to @xmath38 , reducing the sample to 4813 .    in this analysis",
    ", we used the color catalogs processed by terapix for all four deep fields ( version t0003 ) , but with a different set of updated masks produced by one of the authors ( c.b . ) to cover defective regions and those surrounding very bright stars .",
    "this was performed in two steps : first by creating automatic polygons centered on stars brighter than i=19.0 with a shape including diffraction spikes and a size scaled to the star magnitudes ; second by correcting by hand these polygons in the case of the brightest stars that show large ghosts and by adding polygons to mask remaining defects such as satellite trails . from these catalogs",
    ", we selected only objects classified as galaxies by the terapix group , from a morphological criterion based on their location in a compactness ( radius containing 50@xmath39 of the total flux ) -magnitude distribution ( see terapix site ) , and located outside masked regions , in order to avoid objects with contaminated magnitudes .",
    "the photometric redshifts we use are those provided in these catalogs , calculated by the le phare code , which is based on a template fitting method and improved by an empirical training set , which reduces the dispersion @xmath40 from 0.047 to 0.029 . only galaxies with available magnitudes in at least three bands had photometric redshifts determined . the process to calculate such redshifts",
    "is described in detail in and was conducted by the terapix and vvds teams .",
    "we choose the @xmath23 band as the one defining the samples in this work , since it is the closest to that ( @xmath35-band ) defining the vvds sample . comparing @xmath41 ( cfhtls ) and @xmath42 ( vvds ) magnitudes down to @xmath43 and @xmath44 we find @xmath45 . due to this small difference",
    ", we took for the @xmath23 band the same values for the magnitude limit as the one in the @xmath35-band .",
    "thus , whenever we analyzed data from the cfhtls individual fields ( and specially to compare the results with the vvds survey ) we used the limits @xmath46 , also restraining the analysis to @xmath47 .",
    "when analyzing the sample from the combination of the four cfhtls areas , we extended these limits to @xmath48 , corresponding to a 80@xmath39 completeness level .    for a sample with magnitude limit of @xmath43 ( as in this work ) , it is still possible to probe the faint end of the luminosity function at @xmath49 and determine a reliable value for @xmath26 when fitting the schechter function . due to the lack of good sampling of faint objects at higher redshifts , we fix the value of @xmath26 , usually for @xmath50 , to that obtained in a previous bin",
    "where @xmath26 is more reliably determined .    in the analysis of the following sections , we subdivide the samples in individual cfhtls fields in redshift intervals [ 0.05 - 0.2 ] , [ 0.2 - 0.4 ] , [ 0.4 - 0.6 ] , [ 0.6 - 0.8 ] , [ 0.8 - 1.0 ] , [ 1.0 - 1.3 ] and [ 1.3 - 2.0 ] as used by .",
    "when analyzing the combined sample of four fields , the last intervals considered are [ 1.3 - 1.6 ] and [ 1.6 - 2.0 ] .",
    "table [ tab : appendix ] presents the number of galaxies in each redshift bin for each sample analyzed in this work .",
    "we discard galaxies with large i - band magnitude errors ( @xmath510.30 mag ) and photometric redshift errors ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this process discards 30@xmath39 of the galaxies in the redshift bin [ 0.05 - 0.2 ] , less than 1@xmath39 in the bin [ 0.2 - 0.4 ] and a negligible amount in more distant bins .",
    "the total number of galaxies in the four cfhtls deep fields resulting from all these selections mentioned above is 385910 objects .",
    "in order to check how well photometric redshifts reproduce the luminosity function obtained with spectroscopic redshifts , we selected a sample of galaxies from the cfhtls - d1 field in common with the vvds area , with both spectroscopic and photometric redshift determinations .",
    "we call this data the spectroscopic sample",
    ". we note that photometric redshifts for field d1 were obtained in the cfhtls from all available magnitudes which means that for many galaxies of this spectroscopic sample typically 5 to 9 filters were used .",
    "luminosity functions were calculated in different redshift intervals and schechter fits were obtained .",
    "the derived @xmath2 and @xmath6 are presented in table [ tab : spectsamp ] ( results obtained using both spectroscopic ( @xmath53 ) and photometric ( @xmath54 ) redshifts ) , while the luminosity functions and their schechter fits are shown in figure [ lf_spectsamp ] .",
    "we note that these functions are not representative of a fair galaxy sample since we do not apply the corrections for sampling biases and redshift determination efficiency rate as described by .",
    "nevertheless , since our primary goal is to compare luminosity functions derived with @xmath54 and @xmath53 , for the same set of objects , the fact that both functions are not fair representations is not relevant and they are computed only to evaluate their differences in @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "these differences are shown in figure [ comp_spectsamp ]",
    ".    at small redshifts ( @xmath55 ) the uncertainties are large and might reflect the small number of galaxies in this bin ( see table [ tab : appendix ] ) which prevents a reliable determination of @xmath2 and @xmath6 . at higher redshifts",
    "the results show a remarkable agreement indicating that photometric redshifts reproduce the spectroscopic results .",
    "we also calculate the luminosity function for all galaxies in the vvds area using photometric redshifts and compare the characteristic parameters with those derived spectroscopically by yielding a good agreement between both results . however ,",
    "as shown below , the availability of four cfhtls areas similar in size can be used to improve the statistics concerning this comparison as well as to investigate and quantify the differences due to cosmic variance , at the @xmath3 ( effective ) square degree scale . differently from field",
    "d1 , photometric redshifts for fields d2 , d3 and d4 were obtained from the set of filters @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath23 , and @xmath31 .",
    "we estimate that for the combined four cfhtls fields , 76@xmath39 of the objects had @xmath54 calculated with at least these five filters .",
    "moreover as shown by , the inclusion of the bvrijk magnitudes for galaxies in the cfhtls - d1 field reduces the number of catastrophic events at @xmath56 ( due to the @xmath36 and @xmath22 bands ) but reduces @xmath40 from 0.029 to 0.026 . as discussed by this",
    "is the larger effect of including the additional vvds filters and the j and k bands .",
    "these authors also conclude that the accuracy of the photometric redshifts decreases toward fainter apparent magnitudes and although half of the objects with catastrophic errors are those classified as starburst , the redshift accuracy is approximately independent of type .",
    "the derived luminosity functions and respective schechter fits for each cfhtls field are presented in figure [ lf_cfhtareas ] for different redshift bins .",
    "characteristic parameters @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 of schechter fits are presented in table [ tab : cfhtareas ] .",
    "although there is a general good agreement , systematic differences are seen among the fields , showing that cosmic variance is present in samples determined at the 0.7 deg@xmath57 scale . in order to increase the number of objects in each redshift bin and minimize cosmic variance , we merged the samples of the four fields in a single combined cfhtls sample . the luminosity functions and their schechter fits in each redshift bin , as well as the magnitude range used for fitting , are shown in figure [ lf_cfhtareascomb ] , while @xmath2 , @xmath6 and @xmath26 are presented in table [ tab : cfhtareascomb ] .",
    "we note two features from figure [ lf_cfhtareascomb ] .",
    "one is that with photometric redshifts it is possible to infer the apparent non - linear shape of the faint end of the luminosity functions seen at redshifts @xmath58 .",
    "it is tempting to identify an upturn of the function before the incompleteness cut in the closest redshift bins .",
    "there is still a lot of discussion in the literature concerning this issue ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is beyond the scope of this paper to address this question .",
    "we briefly mention that some authors such as @xcite claim the necessity to modify the schechter function to correctly describe the data , particularly the upturn of the function at faint magnitudes .",
    "anyway , it is becoming clear that this feature is a consequence of a mix of galaxy populations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which at fainter magnitudes are dominated by very late type galaxies .",
    "we mention this issue again in the next section .",
    "a second interesting feature is the systematic excess of galaxies at the bright end ( @xmath59 ) , a range which introduces significant uncertainties on the fitted schechter functions and which were avoided in our fitting process .",
    "indeed the small areas of the individual cfhtls fields may be subject to a particular larger structure in a given redshift bin .",
    "for instance , @xcite detected a galaxy cluster at @xmath60 in field d2 that could be the reason for the excess at the bright end displayed by the respective luminosity function in figure [ lf_cfhtareas ] .",
    "however , the combined luminosity functions in figure [ lf_cfhtareascomb ] do show the excess for all redshift bins where the bright end is observable .",
    "we note that @xcite have also shown this excess in their analysis of the sdss - dr6 and claim this is the contribution of galaxies with active nuclei , presenting a luminosity excess compared to normal galaxies .",
    "the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath6 for the individual fields as well as for the combined sample are shown in figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] .",
    "the results of the combined area largely agrees with those of for the evolution of both @xmath2 and @xmath6 , as well as with those for the sdss of @xcite for the dr1 and @xcite for the dr6 .",
    "these results indicate for the global sample a slow fading of @xmath2 with cosmic time by @xmath3 mag from @xmath61 to @xmath62 and a much faster dimming by @xmath63 mag to @xmath64 .",
    "our results are also compatible with those of @xcite , who analyzing the deep2 and combo-17 surveys in the b - band , find a dimming in @xmath2 of 1.2 - 1.3 mag from @xmath65 to @xmath64 .",
    "also , find that , in the zcosmos 10k sample , @xmath2 fades in the b - band by @xmath3 mag from @xmath66 to @xmath67 .",
    "the lower panel of figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] shows for @xmath6 a similar trend as that of @xmath2 with an increase in density by a factor of @xmath7 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "the data suggest that there is also a significant increase in the characteristic density of @xmath2 galaxies in the @xmath23-band from @xmath68 to @xmath64 , by a factor of @xmath69 .",
    "we also show in this figure the results of for the @xmath23 band , which uses photometric redshifts and essentially indicates no evolution for @xmath2 and @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the plateau seen in the lower panel of figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] in the interval @xmath70 is consistent with the decrease of the merging rate shown in figure 5 of @xcite .",
    "also noticeable in figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] is that , near @xmath64 , @xmath2 dims rapidly , while @xmath6 also rises significantly , with these values at z=0 agreeing with those observed in sdss .",
    "this will be addressed in the next section .    since the errorbars plotted in this figure for the combined area are the variances of @xmath2 and @xmath6 , for the four fields , figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] and table [ tab : cfhtareas ] allow us to estimate that the effect of cosmic variance over @xmath2 is @xmath71 mag for these fields of size @xmath3 square degree for @xmath72 .",
    "similarly , the effect of cosmic variance over @xmath6 from these areas is @xmath73gals mag@xmath74mpc@xmath75 .",
    "as many authors have pointed out , the shape of the luminosity functions largely depends on the galaxy population mix of the sample under analysis .",
    "so , in order to investigate the relative contributions of each galaxy type to the luminosity function evolution , we have the advantage that the cfhtls catalog includes the best fit sed type that gave rise to the galaxy redshift .",
    "this is one of the additional benefits of using a template fitting method to compute photometric redshifts .",
    "we stress that although we refer to the galaxy types in this work as e , s , irr and starburst ( sb ) , they should be considered spectral types instead of morphological ones , since they are attributed as a result of a sed fitting process .",
    "luminosity functions and respective schechter fits for these types are presented in table [ tab : cfhttypes ] and shown in figure [ lf_cfhtareascombt ] in different redshift bins for the combined cfhtls areas .",
    "the combination of the four fields was particularly important in the case of the samples separated per galaxy type , in order for them to be statistically significant .",
    "the galaxies classified here as ( irr+sb ) outnumber the e and s types for objects fainter than @xmath76 at all redshifts and are the dominant class for @xmath77 , as can be seen from figure [ lf_cfhtareascombt ] .",
    "as noted by , these galaxies are responsible for most of the evolution ( and steepening ) of the global luminosity function measured by .",
    "we also note the rise of the e class at @xmath78 , forming even at these early epochs the majority of the brightest objects ( @xmath79 ) . as the ( irr+sb)-type",
    ", s - type galaxies display in the cfhtls data a schechter form at early epochs , in the range @xmath80 , but present local deviations at the faint end at @xmath81 .",
    "moreover , figure [ lf_cfhtareascombt ] shows that , as reported by different authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the steepness of the global luminosity function is due to the increasing number of ( irr+sb)-type galaxies with decreasing luminosity .",
    "also , the contribution of the s - type galaxies may play a role in deviating the luminosity function from a linear form at the faint end .",
    "we also note that the excess at the bright end at @xmath82 is present in the latter types as clearly seen in the ( irr+sb ) luminosity functions .    in figures",
    "[ mfievol_cfhtareascombe ] , [ mfievol_cfhtareascombs ] and [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb7 ] we show the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath6 for the luminosity functions of types e , s and ( irr+sb ) galaxies .",
    "we present values with reference to those at @xmath83 , termed here @xmath84 and @xmath85 , in order to compare with different authors .",
    "we find that in the @xmath23-band :    - e - galaxies show a mild evolution of @xmath2 , with a dimming of @xmath86 mag from @xmath87 to @xmath68 while their number density increases in the same redshift interval by a factor @xmath88 .",
    "we have also considered evolutionary effects using the @xmath22-corrections from @xcite derived for the sdss , and based on the evolutionary synthesis code pegase-2 of . using the @xmath22-correction representing passive evolution",
    ", we find that it does seem to reproduce reasonably well the 0.6 mag dimming of this type of galaxies , in the redshift range mentioned above ;    - s - galaxies undergo a fading in their characteristic value @xmath2 by 1.3 mag from @xmath61 to @xmath68 while @xmath6 presents an increase by a factor of at least 2 from @xmath89 to @xmath62 ;    - ( irr+sb)-galaxies shows a continuous decrease in brightness @xmath90 mag in @xmath2 from @xmath61 to @xmath91 . on the other hand",
    "@xmath6 presents a distinctive evolution : it rises by a factor @xmath7 from @xmath4 to @xmath92 , then proceeds in the reverse sense with a decrease in density by a factor @xmath93 to @xmath68 .",
    "we note that this galaxy type presents lower accuracies of photometric redshifts determinations as shown in figure 8 of ;    - inspection of table [ lf_cfhtareascombt ] indicates that the slope of the faint end does not change significantly for each galaxy type .",
    "as can be verified from figures [ mfievol_cfhtareascombe ] , [ mfievol_cfhtareascombs ] and [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb7 ] these results are , in general , in very good agreement with what was found by other surveys such as the photometric musyc - ecdfs @xcite and combo-17 @xcite , as well as the spectroscopic vvds , deep-2 @xcite and z - cosmos . in order to perform these comparisons we assumed that , in the musyc - ecdfs , early type galaxies correspond to our e - galaxies , while their late type objects ( not shown because present large variations ) correspond to our s - galaxies . concerning the comparison with the vvds",
    ", we assumed that their type 1 galaxies correspond to our objects classified as e - type , while their types 2 and 3 correspond to our s - types and their type 4 corresponds to our ( irr+sb)-galaxies . when comparing with the deep-2 and combo-17 we assumed that their red galaxies represent our e - type galaxies and their blue sample represents our s - galaxies .",
    "the comparison with the z - cosmos results was done assuming that their type 1 corresponds to our e - galaxies , their type 2 corresponds to our s - galaxies and their types 3 and 4 correspond to our ( irr+sb ) galaxies .",
    "small discrepancies may have origin in the different criteria used to define the galaxy types in these works and in our analysis .",
    "it is interesting to note that the lower panels of figures [ mfievol_cfhtareascombe ] and [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb7 ] show that , in the range @xmath94 , most of the decline @xmath6 for the ( irr+sb)-type galaxies is compensated by a comparable increase of the e - type galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the transformation of blue cloud galaxies into red sequence objects proposed by several previous authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    from table [ tab : cfhttypes ]",
    "we find that for @xmath95 the rise of @xmath6 in the lower panel of figure [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb ] is due to the contribution of the s and ( irr+sb ) populations which is twice of that of the e - type galaxies , and which cause a decrease in the mean value of @xmath2 . even though this is a possible explanation",
    ", one should also be aware that in this interval photometric redshift errors are larger , in particular because the galaxy population is dominated by star - forming galaxies , which may impact the results .",
    "we note that the good match between our results in the @xmath96-band and those of other works concerning the evolutionary trends of @xmath2 and @xmath6 is present even in the case of surveys in the @xmath32-band such as the deep-2 and z - cosmos . in order to verify",
    "if the fact that we are comparing different bands introduces inconsistencies in this comparison ( a younger stellar content predominantly contributes to the @xmath32-band while an older stellar content to the @xmath96-band ) we calculate the luminosity functions in a bluer filter such as the @xmath97-band .",
    "the resulting @xmath2 and @xmath6 are also plotted in figures [ mfievol_cfhtareascombe ] , [ mfievol_cfhtareascombs ] and [ mfievol_cfhtareascomb7 ] and present a good agreement with the @xmath96-band , indicating that the latter may be used to study the cosmic evolution of galaxy populations .",
    "we note that , when deriving the luminosity density evolution , find measurable differences between the i and b bands in the vvds data .",
    "since , in our results , @xmath98 is slightly steeper in the @xmath29-band for latter types we checked for more subtle differences between the @xmath96 and @xmath97 bands performing linear fits to the @xmath2 evolution for these filters , in the range @xmath99 .",
    "the difference , in this redshift interval , is only 0.05 mag for the e - type galaxies and increases from @xmath100 mag for the s - type galaxies to @xmath101 mag for the ( irr+sb)-type galaxies .",
    "these results are consistent with a stronger evolution of the luminosity in the bluer bands , which probes star formation better , and is more intense in later type galaxies .",
    "in this paper we have used the spectroscopic and photometric data available from vvds and cfhtls surveys to determine how well can we reproduce the evolution of luminosity function based on large photometric samples .",
    "this is a necessary exercise considering the large photometric surveys been planned for this decade .",
    "1- using a sample extracted from the vvds data containing galaxies with both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts we obtain very similar luminosity functions , reproducing with @xmath54 the schechter parameters @xmath2 and @xmath6 obtained with @xmath53 , within the errorbars ;    2- we also find that we can reproduce with the photometric data of the cfhtls the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath6 of the spectroscopic vvds sample as obtained by .",
    "these results indicate from @xmath102 1.8 to 0.3 a mild dimming in @xmath2 of @xmath3 mag while @xmath6 increases by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "5- we used template fitting from the available terapix photometric catalogs of the cfhtls to assign galaxy types and derive type dependent luminosity functions .",
    "we find that we can reproduce with the combined cfhtls sample the evolution of the characteristic parameters of the luminosity function of existing spectroscopic surveys such as the vvds , deep2 @xcite and zcosmos .",
    "evolution of @xmath2 , as a dimming with cosmic time , is similar for all galaxy types , but less pronounced for e - type galaxies .",
    "the characteristic densities @xmath6 of e and s type galaxies evolve similarly as an increase towards low redshifts , while very late types show a distinctive evolution with a decrease in density from @xmath107 to 0.3 .",
    "6- we find also that the variation of the faint end slope of the global luminosity function is essentially due to the evolving mixture of galaxy types with the increasing proportion of e and s galaxy types with decreasing redshift .",
    "there are issues in the present analysis that deserve further investigation with larger and deeper samples .",
    "for instance , the ( irr+sb)-type galaxies , which seem to play an important role at @xmath108 , are known to present large photometric redshift errors . a more detailed analysis involving",
    "the comparison with spectroscopic redshifts would be of interest to evaluate the reliability of the results obtained here .    also , redefining the late - type sample , for instance by combining s+irr as a single class and starburst galaxies as a separate class , may contribute to a better interpretation of the effects involved in the evolution of the luminosity function and thus a better understanding of the processes driving galaxy evolution .",
    "finally , re - computing the photometric redshifts without the @xmath28-band may provide limits to the redshift interval which can be used to study the evolution of the luminosity function by future surveys such as des that will not include this filter .",
    "indeed show the importance of the @xmath28-band to photometric redshifts determinations in the ranges @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the results of this paper show the ability of photometric redshifts in estimating distances when a large database is used , as will be the case of des and future projects in the petabyte scale as lsst .",
    "modern computational tools designed to treat this kind of data provide powerful analyzes taking advantage of multi - band photometry .",
    "larger sky areas to be surveyed by these projects will yield deeper insight concerning the characterization of the galaxy luminosity function and its evolution .    based on observations obtained with megaprime / megacam , a joint project of cfht and cea / dapnia , at the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) which is operated by the national research council ( nrc ) of canada , the institut national des science de lunivers of the centre national de la recherche scientifique ( cnrs ) of france , and the university of hawaii .",

    "<S> we use the galaxy classification provided by the template fitting program used to compute photometric redshifts and split the sample into galaxy types . </S>",
    "<S> we find that these schechter parameters evolve differently for each galaxy type , an indication that their evolution is a combination of several effects : galaxy merging , star formation quenching and mass assembly . </S>",
    "<S> all these results are compatible with those obtained by different spectroscopic surveys such as vvds , deep2 and zcosmos , which reinforces the fact that photometric redshifts can be used to study galaxy evolution , at least for the redshift bins adopted so far . </S>",
