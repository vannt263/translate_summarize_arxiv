    "most of binaries , which exhibit the x - ray activity , have a circular orbit around the common center of mass , in which an accretion disk is mainly formed via the roche lobe overflow from a mass - donor star . on the other hand , in be / x - ray binaries which consist of a neutron star and a be star , an accretion disk is formed around the neutron star via the mass transfer from the circumsteller disk of the",

    "little work has been so far done on the accretion flow around the neutron star with an attention to the difference between the overflow from the circumsteller disk around the be star ( model  a ) and the roche lobe overflow from the be star ( model  b ) . in this paper , we study how the material accretes onto the neutron star in both cases , performing three dimentional ( 3d ) smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations .",

    "( 2002 ) ; bate , bonnell & price ( 1995 ) ] . in order to investigate the accretion flow around the neutron star , two simulations have the same parameters as hayasaki & okazaki ( 2005b ) except for the eccentricity @xmath0 , the mass transfer rate @xmath1 and the inner boundary radius @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the semi - major axis of the binary . in model  b , the roche lobe overflow is modelled by launching the gas particles at the inner laglange point @xmath4 , in which we add @xmath5 sph particles per orbit with an initial speed @xmath6 , in a direction @xmath7 rad prograde of the binary axis ( lubow & shu 1975 ) . in what follows ,",

    "we have perfomed 3d sph simulations in order to compare the accretion flow onto the neutron star induced by roche lobe overflow with that by the overflow from the be disk in a a zero eccentricity , short period binary with the same mass - transfer rate .",
    "we have found that a persistent accretion disk is formed around the neutron star in both cases , as seen in fig.2 . the mass accretion rate in model  a is much higher than that in model  b becasue of the smaller circularization radius in model  a , as shown in fig.1 and 3 .",
    "this indicates that the disk growth is faster as the specific angular momentum of gas particles is lower . in either case , the tiny mass - accretion rate is consistent with the observed x - ray behaviour of be / x - ray binaries with circular orbits ( e.g. xte j1543 - 568 ) .",
