    "since their discovery , the time resolved spectral analysis of grbs has been a testing ground ",
    "floor for the models proposed for the @xmath0ray prompt emission ( ford et al . 1995 ; preece et al .",
    "nonetheless , the mechanism(s ) responsible for their emission is still an open problem ( ghisellini 2003 ) .",
    "different authors ( crider et al . 1997 , 1999 ; preece et al . 1998 , 2002 ; ghirlanda et al . 2002 ) have shown that the low energy photon spectrum ( typically represented by a powerlaw @xmath1 ) can be harder than the limit of the optically thin synchrotron model ( @xmath2 , katz 1994 ; tavani 1996 ) which is the most popular mechanism proposed for interpreting the burst emission .",
    "modifications of the simplest optically thin synchrotron model ( lloyd & petrosian 2000 , 2002 ; medvedev 2001 ) or variants based on comptonization ( liang et al .",
    "1997 ; ghisellini & celotti 1999 ; lazzati et al .",
    "2000 ) have been proposed to solve the inconsistency between theory and observations .",
    "all these models predict different limits for the low energy spectral hardness and can be directly tested by the comparison with the hardest bursts observed by batse .",
    "we present the results of the time resolved spectral analysis of 5 bursts with a low energy spectral component harder than a flat photon spectrum , i.e. @xmath3 , for most of their duration .",
    "these results are shown to constrain the above emission models ( ghirlanda , celotti & ghisellini 2003 ) .    another interesting aspect of grb spectra which we consider is their possible thermal character , which is predicted by the fireball model ( goodman 1986 ; paczynski 1986 ) .",
    "we find that the spectrum in the initial phase of these extremely hard bursts is successfully fitted with a thermal black body emission .",
    "the interpretations and implications of these results are discussed ( ghirlanda et al 2003 ) in the framework of a photospheric ( e.g. mszros & rees 2000 , daigne & mockovitch 2002 ) and of the compton drag model ( lazzati et al .",
    "2000 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "grb 980306 represents a newly discovered case of hard burst . the spectral evolution of its first 6 s is reported in fig.1 ( left panel ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4 ( mid panel of fig.1 ) indicates that , for most of the pulse , the low energy photon spectrum is harder than @xmath5 . the maximum hardness ( @xmath6 ) is reached at @xmath7 s after the trigger .    in grb 911118 ( fig.1 , right panel )",
    "the low energy spectral index is @xmath8 for the first @xmath9 s ( 32 spectra , phase a ) the hardest photon spectrum ( at @xmath10 s after the trigger ) has @xmath11 .    in order to have homogeneous results",
    "we also re - analyzed three bursts ( grb 910807 , grb 910927 , grb 970111 ) already presented in the literature for their exceptional low energy spectral hardness ( crider et al .",
    "1997 , 2000 ; frontera et al .",
    "2000 ; preece 2002 ) .",
    "considering the relevance of these 5 grbs for the comparison with the models , we also tested the independence of their low energy spectral hardness from possible sources of systematic error such as the detector response , the background calculation or the high energy spectral component .",
    "moreover , we directly verified the low energy spectral hardness comparing the instrumental spectra with a simulated flat spectrum .",
    "these tests ( ghirlanda et al . 2003 ) indicate that most of the time resolved spectra of these bursts are harder than @xmath12 at more than 3@xmath13 .    as anticipated , we performed fits on the hardest spectra also with a black body model . in most of these bursts",
    "the initial 1.5 s of their emission is consistent with a black body with a temperature that decreases with time as roughly @xmath14 starting form @xmath15 kev ( ghirlanda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "grb 980306 and 911118 , together with grb 910807 , 910927 and 970111 represent a challange for the proposed emission processes . their low energy photon spectrum is harder than @xmath16 for a major part of the pulse / s reaching a maximum hardness of @xmath17 .",
    "these results are inconsistent with the optically thin synchrotron model which can not account for spectra harder than @xmath18 ( katz 1994 ) .",
    "also its variants like synchrotron self absorption ( papathanassiou 1999 ; granot , piran & sari 2000 ) , small pitch angles of the emitting particles ( lloyd & petrosian 2000 ) or jitter radiation ( medvedev 2001 ) can produce a spectrum at most as hard as @xmath16 , which is not compatible with the totality of these findings . comptonization models ( liang et al . 1997 ; ghisellini & celotti 1999 ) also have difficulties , although they are consistent with very hard spectra in a limited range of energies .",
    "the possible thermal character of the initial phase of all these 5 bursts can be interpreted as the emission of the fireball shells when they reach the transparency radius ( paczynski 1986 ; see also daigne & mockovitch 2002 ) . for typical fireball parameters and",
    "using our observational findings this radius results @xmath19 cm and the corresponding bulk lorentz factor is @xmath20 .",
    "an alternative scenario is the production of an observed thermal spectrum by the compton drag of soft ( seed ) photons due to the fireball bulk motion ( lazzati et al . 2000 ) . in this case",
    "the seed photons are required to have a temperature of @xmath21 k in order to produce the observed thermal spectrum .",
    "these results are consistent with the typical values assumed in the thoery of grbs ( e.g. , rees & mszros 1994 ) .    at present , we are not able to discriminate between the photospheric and the compton drag scenario",
    ". consider also that emission at times greater than a few seconds can well be due to other processes , possibly linked to internal shocks starting to dominate at later phases .",
    "however , a key difference between the two scenarios is the fact that the seeds photons for the compton drag process can be `` used '' only by the first shells , because the time needed to refill the scattering zone with new seeds exceeds the duration of the burst .",
    "therefore observing black body emission for a long time , or during the rising phase of two time resolved peaks of the same grb would be difficult to explain in terms of the compton drag process .",
    "this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center on line service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
