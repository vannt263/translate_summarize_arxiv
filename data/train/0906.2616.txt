    "however we do have very interesting approaches to the subject using best knowledge of our understanding of general relativity and quantum field theory .",
    "one is the quantum cosmology based on canonical quantization of general relativity . by using hamiltonian formulation of general relativity and regarding 3-metric and its conjugate as fundamental operators , one can obtain schrodinger like equation on the space of 3-metric(superspace ) , known as _ wheeler - dewitt equation _",

    "wheeler - dewitte equation greatly simplifies and an interesting idea for the origin of the universe have been proposed@xcite . however , nobody knows how to calculate the probability of specific universe in this approach , and there are some problems e.g. the problem of time . there has been some progress in the past 10 years or so in this approach based on loop quantum gravity(e.g .",
    "ashtekar @xcite , bojowald @xcite ) .",
    "+ the another approach is based on the path integral quantization and is called no - boundary proposal for the wave function of the universe@xcite . in this approach",
    "the wave function of the universe is defined by summing all euclidean compact geometry weighted by exponential of action @xmath3 without boundary . as hawking",
    "said ; _ the boundary condition of the universe are that has no boundary _",
    "( hartle & hawking @xcite , hawking @xcite ) . according to this proposal the origin of the quasiclassical realm from the no - boundary proposal for the quantum state of the universe has been discussed by hartle , hawking and hertog @xcite in a class of minisuperspace models with homogeneous , isotropic closed spacetime geometries .",
    "they argued that a wave function with the semiclassical form @xmath4 in some region of minisuperspace predicts an ensemble of classical trajectories provided that @xmath5 is rapidly varying and @xmath6 is slowly varying .",
    "it was shown that the complex solutions(metrics ) of euclidean einstein equations that extremize the euclidean action are distinct from the real lorentzian classical metrics for which they provide the probabilities , and the probabilities for classical histories derived from the no - boundary wave function do define a measure on classical phase space .",
    "it will be very interesting to see if it is possible to apply their method to more general class of minisuperspace .",
    "this is the aim of the paper .",
    "namely we investigate the emergence of classical universes with anisotropy according to the prescription proposed by hhh .",
    "we consider the bianchi type ix spacetime which is homogeneous but not isotropic , with a minimally coupled scalar filed moving in a quadratic potential and cosmological constant .",
    "quantum cosmology of bianchi type ix model has been studied using wheeler - dewitte equation .",
    "for example , battisti et al .",
    "@xcite investigated the situation where the isotropic scale factor is considered as intrinsically different variable from anisotropies .",
    "namely , they regarded the scale factor as time - parameter , and showed that the wave function of the universe is spread over all values of anisotropy near the cosmological singularity .",
    "however , it is also shown that the wave function asymptotically peaked around the isotropic configuration when the universe grows large .",
    "we will also find that the universe approaches isotropic configuration , but possible range of anisotropy near the bounce or singularity is very restricted unlike their result , but is consistent with the prediction by loop quantum cosmology@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows .",

    "@xmath24    it is possible to think the hamiltonian ( [ b9h ] ) as that of a particle with triangular shaped potential @xmath25 whose walls are very steep .",
    "therefore the evolution of the closed universe with anisotropy may be expressed by the motion of this point mass ( e.g. misner , thorne & wheeler @xcite ) .",
    "since the motion of the point shows chaotic behavior in general by bouncing between potential walls , it is argued that the classical universe is predicted to behave chaotically taking all possible values of anisotropies .",
    "this model of the universe is called the mixmaster universe .",
    "in this section we review the semi - classical approximation of the no - boundary wave function of the universe according to hhh . +",
    "the no - boundary wave function is defined by sum - over - histories    @xmath26 = \\int \\delta q^a \\mathrm{exp}(-i[q^a(\\lambda)]/\\hbar)\\ ] ]    where @xmath27 are histories of dynamical variables such as @xmath28 , and @xmath29 $ ] is their euclidean action .",

    "of course the physical quantities are real , thus we will set the boundary value @xmath32 as real .",
    "therefore the extremized paths are _ fuzzy instanton _ , which started as complex euclidean geometry and growing to asymptotically real lorentzian at large scale .",

    "in this section we calculate the steepest descent approximation to the no - boundary wave function for the mixmaster universes according to the above prescriptions . we include the cosmological constant and a minimally coupled single scalar field with quadratic potential .    by replacing @xmath42 in ( [ laction ] ) ,",

    "we can see that the universe point bounces between steep walls of the potential .",

    "in fact , the corresponding lorentzian history has completely different trajectory , see figure.[fig : lbeta ] .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the euclidean action are shown in figure.[fig : eaction ] .",
    "while the real part of the action is oscillating in @xmath78 , the real part stabilizes and imaginary part is rapidly varying in @xmath79 ( in large scale ) .",

    "figure.[fig : lx ] shows the two lorentzian histories .",
    "one ( we call model a ) has large anisotropy , the another ( model b ) has small anisotropy .",
    "if there is no anisotropy , the history shows initial bouncing behavior as shown by hhh .",
    "similarly , model b is bouncing as in isotropic case . on the other hand , model",
    "a has an initial singularity .",
    "usually , the existence of singularity is regarded as a sign of the breakdown of the theory .",
    "however hhh claimed that the no - boundary wave function predicts the probability of classical _ histories _ rather than initial data , thus the initial singularity is not a signal of break down of the theory .",
    "since the second time derivative of the scale factor @xmath83 is positive in both models , these histories have inflationary period .",
    "the motion of anisotropy in triangular - shaped potential is shown in figure.[fig : lbeta ] .",

    "we could not find the solution outside of the plotted area .",

    "the probability has maximum at isotropic history , and is rapidly decreasing with the increase of anisotropy .",
    "figure.[fig : ldist ] shows the distribution of @xmath88 at the bounce , and figure.[fig : lkakuritu ] shows their probability distribution .",
    "we can see that states with low anisotropies have higher probabilities .",
    "we found that the distribution of the anisotropy near the bounce is highly inhomogeneous .",
    "this is very different from classical result .",
    "while the classical result predicts chaotic behavior near the initial singularity @xcite@xcite , we could not see such a behavior .",
    "the anisotropy at large scale are shown in figure.[fig : bunpu ] and figure.[fig : kbunpu ] . clearly",
    ", the probability is peaked around the isotropic history .",
    "therefore _ the no - boundary wave function of the universe predicts nearly isotropic universe . _",
    "we investigated the emergence of the classical mixmaster universe with a single scalar field and with the cosmological constant from the no - boundary quantum state according to the method of hhh .",
    "we confirmed that there are complex solutions that satisfy the classicality condition , thus there are classical lorentzian histories with any amount of anisotropies .",
    "this fact implies that the method of hhh can be applied for a wide range of models .",
    "it is also found that the probability of anisotropic universe is lower than isotropic one .",
    "in addition the emerged classical universe experiences the inflationary expansion and the remaining anisotropy decreases rapidly . thus the quantum cosmology with no - boundary wave function may be able to explain quite naturally the emergence of our universe .",
    "we also found that the classical histories have initial singularity or initial bounce depending on the initial acceleration of anisotropies .",
    "high acceleration may induce the initial singularity .",
    "the no - boundary proposal seems to predict that the distribution of anisotropy near the bounce or singularity is not homogeneous and very different from the prediction by classical theory and by analysis of wheeler - dewitt equation @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the loop quantum cosmology predicts non - chaotic behavior near singularity @xcite .",
