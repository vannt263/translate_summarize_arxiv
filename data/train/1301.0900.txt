    "the _ quasihyperbolic metric _ in @xmath3 is a generalization of the hyperbolic metric .",
    "this metric was first studied in @xmath3 by gehring in joint publications @xcite with his students palka and osgood in late 1970 s . since its discovery , the quasihyperbolic",
    "metric has been widely applied in the study of geometric function theory @xcite . at the same time , many basic questions of the quasihyperbolic geometry have remained open . only very recently",
    "several authors have studied questions such as convexity of balls of small radii , uniqueness of geodesics , and quasihyperbolic trigonometry of plane domains .",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "we refer to @xcite for the basic properties of this metric in @xmath4    in banach spaces , the properties of the quasihyperbolic metric were first studied by visl in a series of articles in 1990 s @xcite .",
    "the quasihyperbolic metric is a crucial tool for studying quasiconformal mappings in the in finite dimensional banach spaces because quasiconformality is defined in terms of it .",
    "moreover , the basic tools of the finite dimensional theory in @xmath3 , such as the conformal modulus and finite dimensional measure theory , are not available in the case of infinite dimensional banach spaces .",
    "see @xcite for discussion and motivations on the topic .",
    "a result of gehring and osgood shows that in domains of @xmath3 there is always a quasihyperbolic geodesic between any two points @xcite .",
    "it was proved by martin in @xcite , that the geodesics of the quasihyperbolic metric in @xmath3 are smooth .",
    "the proof makes use of mbius transformations , and it does not work in the banach space setting . in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to generalize these results to the banach space setting .",
    "a result of martio and visl @xcite shows that if @xmath0 is a convex domain of a uniformly convex banach space , then each pair of points @xmath5 is joined by a unique quasihyperbolic geodesic .",
    "the existence argument is based on the fact that each uniformly convex banach space is reflexive and the unit ball of reflexive space is compact in the weak topology .",
    "the geodesic is obtained from a sequence of short paths .",
    "the first of our main results , theorem [ main1 ] , shows by following the arguments of our earlier paper @xcite that in a convex domain @xmath0 of a reflexive strictly convex banach space the quasihyperbolic geodesics are unique .",
    "the argument boils down to taking averages of paths .",
    "we also prove by a counterexample that there does not necessarily exist any quasihyperbolic geodesics between any two points in a convex domain of a non - reflexive banach space .",
    "this appears a somewhat surprising fact and it settles a problem posed in @xcite in the negative .",
    "finally , we show that quasihyperbolic geodesics in a uniformly convex banach space , with a power type modulus of convexity , are @xmath6 smooth .",
    "this result generalizes a classical theorem of martin @xcite in the euclidean setting , as well as visl s recent work in hilbert spaces @xcite .      here",

    "it is clear that @xmath18 defines a metric in @xmath0 .",

    "a _ geodesic _ is a path in a metric space which has the least path length among the paths connecting its endpoints .",
    "we call a metric space _ geodesic _ if each pair of points can be joined by a geodesic ( not necessarily unique ) .",
    "in general domains the quasihyperbolic geodesics need not be unique . a simple example is the space punctured at a point . for the uniqueness one needs additional assumptions such as convexity .",
    "another related topic is the convexity of balls with small radii which was recently proved by kln in the special case of the punctured space @xcite , and by visl @xcite for general plane domains .    by following the arguments in @xcite",
    "one can check the following :    [ main1 ] in a convex domain @xmath0 of a strictly convex banach space with the rnp the quasihyperbolic geodesics are unique .",
