    "fermi liquid theory@xcite ( flt ) is thought to be one of the most successful theories for describing the behaviors of electrons in solids , especially electrons near the fermi energy in metals at low temperature .",
    "the success of the flt in metallic systems naturally raises an issue on how far the flt scheme can be applied to other condensed matter systems .",
    "related to this question , there is a long - standing controversy on whether electrons in graphite , a 2 dimensional semi - metallic system , can be described within the flt scheme or not .",
    "according to flt , the lifetime of an electron due to electron - electron interactions is inversely proportional to the square of the binding energy .",
    "therefore , measurement of the lifetime as a function of the binding energy of an electron would be a direct test of the validity of ftl in graphite .",
    "experimental results do not seem to show evidence for fermi liquid behavior of electrons in graphite@xcite .",
    "in fact , the inverse lifetime measured by 2 photon photoemission experiments ( 2ppe ) conducted on natural single crystal graphite and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite ( hopg ) appears to increase linearly as a function of the binding energy@xcite .",
    "the observed peculiar behavior in the energy dependence of the inverse lifetime was discussed in terms of the peculiar dispersion of plasmon@xcite or electron - electron interaction in combination with the band structure of graphite@xcite .",
    "however , electron - phonon coupling ( epc ) , one of the most fundamental interactions in solids , has not been considered in the discussion . on the theoretical side , very little work can be found on the epc in semi - metals even though it has been well developed and widely studied in metallic systems@xcite . only very recently has some theoretical models for graphene appeared@xcite . on the experimental side ,",
    "electron lifetime was measured only for the energies larger than the maximum phonon energy of graphite ( @xmath2 200 mev)@xcite in the 2ppe experiments@xcite .",
    "therefore , to address the lifetime issue due to epc in graphite , one may need two requirements .",
    "first , the experimental data must show the lifetime of quasi - particles sufficiently close to the fermi energy , less than the maximum phonon energy of graphite .",
    "second , a proper model that considers the electron - phonon interaction contribution to the quasi - particle decay should be developed . in regards to the second point , models developed for metals have been used in the analysis of angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) data on graphite due to the lack of theoretical epc models for semi - metals@xcite .    to address the issue of the quasi - particle dynamics and epc in graphite",
    ", we performed high resolution arpes experiments on high quality natural single crystal and developed a theoretical model that considers linear density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy@xcite .",
    "our previous work was performed near the @xmath1-point and showed a relatively small epc constant @xmath3 = 0.20 . to extend our previous",
    "we have obtained high resolution arpes data from the @xmath0 point to determine if it also has a small epc constant .",
    "in addition , we also performed temperature dependent studies near the @xmath1 point .",
    "the temperature dependent data is compared with a theoretical model that fully considers the graphite dos .",
    "properly extracted peak widths are well understood within our epc model with a linear dos near the fermi energy and shows a small epc constant of less than 0.23 .",
    "we first consider the theoretical side of the quasi - particle dynamics in graphite . in this section ,",
    "we discuss possible decay channels for quasi - particles in graphite .",
    "first , it will be discussed how the lifetime of quasi - particles in graphite can be affected by epc .",
    "we will formulate the self energy of quasi - particles based on the linear dos of graphite , for zero temperature in section 1 and for a finite temperature in section 2 .",
    "the latter is to establish the foundation for estimating the epc constant through temperature dependent studies .",
    "second , we will discuss other decay channels such as electron - electron scattering , electron - plasmon scattering , and impurity and defect scattering . through these discussions , we wish to establish that the dominant scattering mechanism for quasi - particles in graphite comes from the epc .",
    "electron - phonon interaction theory is an extensively studied subject in condensed matter physics .",
    "the importance of its role is high - lighted in the theory for conventional superconductors , i.e. , the bcs theory .",
    "even though a general theory should be applicable to any system , specific and more applicable models have been developed for metallic systems .",
    "however , a key assumption used for metallic systems , constant dos near the fermi level , is not valid for semi - metals and insulators . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "epcs in semi - metals and insulators have not been thoroughly studied theoretically ( probably due to lack of interest ) . with recent developments in graphene / graphite related",
    "research@xcite , epc in semi - metals has become more important .",
    "therefore , we need a model to evaluate the epc constant in graphite .",

    "the scattering rate is proportional to the number of such @xmath37 states , thus the dos at @xmath38 .",
    "note that if the binding energy of the photo - hole is smaller than the phonon energy @xmath27 , the scattering can not occur because there are no electrons with sufficient energy to emit a phonon with energy @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the imaginary part of self energy of photo - hole as a function of the binding energy is proportional to @xmath39 and looks like a schematic shown in fig .",

    "meanwhile some difference between @xmath1 and @xmath0 certainly exists that affects the detailed shape of @xmath46 near the fermi energy , the effect on the epc constant @xmath3 should to be negligible because the contribution comes mostly from the high binding energy side .",
    "we now move onto the finite temperature case . in the case of metals",
    ", there is an easy way to extract the epc constant @xmath3 from temperature dependent data through a simple formula@xcite .",
    "the formula is derived under the assumption that the electronic dos near the fermi energy is constant , which is not the case for graphite . here",
    ", we investigate the temperature dependence of @xmath46 theoretically to determine if one can easily extract @xmath3 from the temperature dependence data .",
    "it turns out that a simple formula such as the one for metals can not be formulated .",
    "however , we show some possibility of estimating epcs from the temperature dependent data .    the imaginary part of the self - energy by electron - phonon coupling at finite temperature was shown in eqn .",
    "( 3 ) of the previous section .",
    "note that for the high phonon frequency ( for example , @xmath48 or @xmath49 mode in graphite ) the bose factors can be neglected for the temperature range over which we performed our experiments ( 10k-225k ) .",
    "we consider not only these high energy phonons but also low energy phonons .",
    "unfortunately , the temperature dependence of @xmath46 in eqn .",
    "( 7 ) can not be reduced to a simple form as the one for a metal@xcite and extracting the @xmath3 from the temperature dependence of @xmath46 is not an straight forward task . however , one can still obtain information from the temperature dependent data . if the low frequency phonon mode participates in epc , the temperature dependence of @xmath46 near the fermi level should be strong while the high frequency phonon modes should contribute little to the temperature dependence . in addtion , the bose factor in eqn . ( 3 ) is not negligible and @xmath46 will show clear difference at different temperature .",
    "therefore , once the @xmath19 value is known , one can roughly identify which phonon mode contributes the most to epc by fitting the temperature dependent data .",
    "= 8.5 cm    electron - electron interactions can also affect the quasi - particle lifetime or the imaginary part of self energy .",
    "we consider the lowest order scattering in electron - electron interaction occurring via electron - hole pair creation .",
    "the feynman diagram for this scattering process is shown in fig .",
    "when the photo - hole , of crystal momentum is @xmath33 , is created , the hole makes the transition to @xmath37 by creating another hole , @xmath50 , and electron , @xmath51 .",
    "3(b ) shows this electron - hole pair creation process in the @xmath52 phase space . from the figure",
    ", one can see that the electron - hole pair creation process is negligible under the linear dos of graphite near the fermi energy .",
    "let us consider the available phase space for electron - hole pair creation in fig .",
    "if we plot the energy difference ( @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the energies of the holes with @xmath37 and @xmath33 , respectively ) as a function of momentum difference ( @xmath56 ) , the possible transitions occupy the area below the dashed line in fig 3(d ) . in a similar way",
    ", one can find that electron - hole creation process occupies the hatched area in fig .",
    "photo - hole decay through the electron - hole pair creation can occur only when the two conditions are met , that is , where the phase spaces for the two processes overlap .",
    "they overlap only on the dashed line as can be seen in fig .",
    "therefore , the available phase space volume for the decay through electron - hole pair creation is zero .",
    "note that , this is true only near the fermi energy where the band structure can be approximated by dirac cones . for the photo - holes at higher binding energies ,",
    "the available phase space volume is becomes non - zero .",
    "this fact was previously pointed out by _ _ moos et al.__@xcite if we limit our discussion to the low energy dynamics in graphite , the effect of the electron - electron interaction can be neglected .",
    "there are other mechanisms in graphite that may contribute to the quasi - particle scattering such as plasmons , impurities and defects .",

    "however , _",
    "spataru et al .",
    "_ showed that elctron - hole pair creation should be a more dominant mechanism than electron - plasmon interactions for electron scattering in graphite@xcite .",
    "since we have shown in our earlier work@xcite that electron - phonon interaction is more dominant than electron - hole pair creation based on a phase space argument , we may conclude that electron - plasmon interaction is much weaker than electron - phonon coupling and thus may be neglected .",
    "impurity and defect scattering can also contribute to the scattering rate in graphite .",
    "these scattering mechanisms also have a rate that is proportional to the electronic dos as in the electron - phonon coupling case and thus increase the slope for the imaginary part of the self energy .",
    "this fact tells us that , if one wants to study the electron - phonon coupling , the experiment should be conducted on clean single crystalline graphite . in our case , we used natural graphite single crystals which have superior quality to crystals used in other experiments . as a results , we did not observe any defect related states@xcite and we therefore believe that defect or impurity scattering is minimal",
    ".    in short electron - phonon coupling should be mechanism , other mechanisms are suppressed due to lack of phase space ( electron - hole pair ) or high quality of the crystal ( low impurity / defect levels ) .",
    "arpes experiments were performed at beamline 7.0.1 of the advanced light source .",
    "we used very high quality natural graphite single crystals with sizes larger than @xmath57 1 cm .",
    "samples were cleaved repeatedly _ ex situ _ by taping method until a flat surface without large flakes were obtained .",
    "samples were subsequently introduced to the ultra high vacuum chamber and annealed at 900@xmath58 for 30 minutes in a vacuum better than 6.0@xmath59 torr . to clean the surface .",

    "we took @xmath62 data at 20k with a photon energy of 103.4 ev to obtain the electron - phonon coupling by analyzing the peak width as a function of the binding energy .",

    "after having measured at 25k , we annealed the sample again for @xmath57 30 seconds , at @xmath57 900@xmath58 and measured again .",
    "comparison of the data before and after annealing showed essentially no difference , indicating there was no surface contamination during the measurement . for comparison ,",

    "the electronic band near the fermi energy shows a linear dispersion as predicted in the band calculation in fig 1.(c ) .",
    "however , we also note that the band dispersion very near the fermi level shows some parabolic component contrary to what is expected from the theory",

    "this indicates that our natural graphite single crystals are of very high quality .",
    "almost , the negligible background of our data even at high binding energy further supports the high quality of our sample .",

    "the line shape of the edc is very asymmetric .",
    "as was the case for the @xmath1 data@xcite , we can understand this asymmetry as follows .",
    "though we tuned the photon energy to probe the @xmath0 point of graphite , the finite escape depth of the photoelectron yields an uncertainty in @xmath40 , @xmath65 where @xmath61 is the escape depth .",
    "therefore , there is contribution from other @xmath40 values which is illustrated in fig .",
    "as the bb and nb have finite @xmath40 dispersions , the contribution from other @xmath40 values results in broadening of the spectral function .",

    "the obtained @xmath42 is converted to @xmath70 through a hilbert transform .",
    "the extracted epc parameter at @xmath0 is @xmath57 0.23 , which is small , consistent with the value 0.2 from the k point in our previous work .",
    "this small epc parameter is also consistent with very weak kinky features in our data .",
    "in addition , we conducted temperature dependent arpes measurements on the graphite k point .",
    "the temperature dependent data shows no notable evolution in the edc lineshape within the temperature range ( 25 - 225k ) . analyzing the experimental temperature dependence of peak widths and simulated temperature dependence ,",
    "we conclude that the dominant phonon mode in epc in graphite is much larger than the temperature scale of our experiment 225k .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that the phonon mode in electron - phonon coupling in graphite is the 200 mev optical phonon mode as is the case for graphene .",
    "even though electron - phonon coupling has been heavily studied , most of these studies were focused on metallic systems where the density of states near the fermi level is approximately constant .",
    "such is not generally true , especially for semi - metals .",
    "the formulas discussed in this work are very general and can be used for any shape of electronic density of states .",
    "it should therefore be useful in the future studies on semi - metals .",
