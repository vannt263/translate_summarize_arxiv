    "the decameter radio telescopes with large effective areas such as utr-2 equipped with spectrometers operating in a broad frequency band have discovered fast type iii bursts @xcite , dog - leg type iii bursts @xcite , and decameter spikes @xcite .",
    "moreover the modern back - end facilities with high time - frequency resolution allowed us to study the properties of fine temporal structure of type ii and iii bursts ( melnik _ et al .",

    "the main parameters of the solar radio bursts are the frequency band width , frequency drift rate , duration , polarization degree , and flux of the radio emission .",
    "this set of parameters allows us to classify radio bursts .",
    "for example , a typical frequency drift rate of the usual ( not fast ) type iii bursts in the decameter range is 2 - 4 mhz s@xmath0 , whereas type ii bursts have frequency drift rates about 30 - 70 khz s@xmath0 @xcite .",

    "type iv bursts are observed during an interval from 1 - 1.5 h to several hours @xcite , whereas s - bursts have duration of only 0.3 - 0.6 s. the frequency drift rate of s - bursts is about 1 mhz s@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the sources of radio emission for different types of bursts are fast particles ( in most cases , electrons ) , which propagate through different magnetic structures in the solar corona @xcite .",

    "we report the observation of an unusual solar radio burst .",
    "this burst was recorded simultaneously by two ukrainian decameter radio telescopes , utr-2 ( kharkov , ukraine ) and uran-2 ( poltava , ukraine ) on 3 june 2011 .",
    "the observed solar radio burst can not be referred to any known type of the bursts in the decameter range .",
    "we discuss the properties of this burst and consider the associated radio and plasma phenomena observed simultaneously by soho and stereo .",
    "a model or possible scenario of the unusual burst generation is proposed .",
    "an unusual burst in the form of a  caterpillar \" was observed during a decameter type iii storm at 12:10 on 3 june 2011 .",
    "this burst was observed simultaneously by utr-2 and uran-2 radio telescopes . during this observation",
    "the utr-2 radio telescope was operated in the mode in which only four sections of the north - south branch of the antenna was used .",
    "the total effective area of these four sections was 50000 m@xmath3 with the beam pattern size of @xmath4 at 25 mhz .",
    "the radio telescope uran-2 ( poltava , ukraine ) has the effective area of 28000 m@xmath3 and its beam pattern size is @xmath5 at 25 mhz @xcite .",
    "additionally uran-2 is able to measure the degree of polarization of the received radio signal .",
    "the data were recorded by the digital dsp spectrometers @xcite operating in the frequency range of 16 - 32 mhz with a frequency - time resolution of @xmath6 .",
    "figure 1 shows the dynamic radio spectra obtained by uran-2 ( panel a ) and utr-2 ( panel b ) .",
    "the unusual burst was observed at around 12:10 ut at the frequencies from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
    "this burst was recorded simultaneously by utr-2 and uran-2 radio telescopes and the obtained radio spectra look identically .",
    "high frequency - time resolution of the radio telescopes gives an opportunity to observe a complex fine structure of the unusual burst as shown in figure 2 .",
    "the burst consisted of 14 narrow - band stripes of different duration . comparing this stripe structure with known striae fine features of type iiib bursts we can find significant differences . in particular , the frequency bandwidth of the stripes of the unusual burst is about 300 - 400 khz whereas the striae of type iiib bursts in the decameter range have narrower bandwidth , only 50 - 70 khz @xcite .",
    "the second difference is that individual stria of type iiib present a straight track whereas the stripes of unusual burst looked like a serpentine .",
    "the caterpillar exhibited negative and positive frequency drifts simultaneously .",
    "in particular , the frequency drift rate of the burst was positive ( about 500 khz s@xmath0 ) at frequencies higher than 22 mhz and negative ( 100 khz s@xmath0 ) at lower frequencies .",
    "these frequency drift rates are lower than those for type iii bursts but higher than typical drift rates for type ii bursts in the decameter range .",
    "the maximum flux of the unusual radio burst did not exceed @xmath9 s.f.u .",
    "the very interesting feature of the caterpillar is its strong cut - off at high frequencies . as shown in figure 1",
    "the burst abruptly disappeared at 27.5 mhz . at the same time",
    "there was no cut - off at low frequencies and the burst was observed by stereo significantly below 16 mhz ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "the time profile of the unusual burst at 26 mhz is shown in figure 3 .",
    "contrary to type iii bursts the time profile of the unusual burst had a bell - like shape .",
    "the full duration of the burst varied from 50 s at lower frequencies to 80 s at frequencies above 22 mhz .",
    "such durations are significantly larger than the average durations of individual type iii bursts at decameter wavelengths , namely 6 - 12 s.    figure 4 shows the time profile of the polarization measurements at a frequency of 26 mhz .",
    "the polarization degree of the caterpillar was practically constant and was @xmath10 .",
    "such a degree of polarization is typical for the second harmonic of type iii bursts @xcite .",
    "this give us an idea that if the generation mechanism of the unusual burst is similar to those for type iii bursts , then the unusual burst was radiated at the second harmonic .",
    "additional to the ground - based observations we have also examined the data recorded by radio experiment waves onboard two stereo spacecraft ( stereo - a and stereo - b ; bougeret _ at al .",
    "_ , 2008 ) .",
    "on 3 june 2011 two spacecraft were located on the heliocentric orbits with angular separation @xmath11 , _ i.e. _ on the opposite sides of the sun ( see figure 5b ) .",
    "the dynamic radio spectra recorded by stereo - a and stereo - b in the frequency range from 1 mhz to 16 mhz are shown in figure 5a .",
    "as is seen , only one spacecraft , stereo - a , observed the unusual burst at @xmath12 12:10 ut .",
    "stereo - b recorded only a group of type iii bursts at frequencies lower than 2 mhz at around 12:04 ut , which was also well visible in the utr-2 and uran-2 spectra ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "taking into account the positions of stereo - a and stereo - b ( figure 5b ) we conclude that the source of the unusual burst was situated on the west side of the sun with respect to the earth .",
    "we have also estimated the frequency drift rate of the unusual burst observed by stereo - a at frequencies 1 - 16 mhz .",
    "this drift rate was about 50 khz s@xmath0 which was smaller than typical drift rates of type iii bursts at these frequencies ( see , for example , a group of type iii bursts at 12:04 in figure 5a ) .",
    "after detection of the caterpillar ( at 12:10 ut ) two coronagraphs lasco c2 and c3 onboard soho have observed three phenomena on the west side of the solar disk ( figure 6 ) . in particular lasco c2 recorded two successive ejections appeared at 12:48 and 13:36 ut .",
    "the sizes of these two ejections were smaller than the typical size of coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) . at 12:48 there was also a jet at a latitude higher than those of the ejections ( figure 6 ) . according to uv images from soho ( figure 7a ) no active regions were detected on the west side of the solar disk . at the same time",
    "stereo - a / euvi observed two active regions noaa 1224 and noaa 1222 situated at approximately @xmath13 and @xmath14 of western longitude with respect to the central meridian ( figure 7b ) .",
    "since noaa 1222 was on the lower latitude than the active region noaa 1224 we may consider that noaa 1222 initiated two ejections while the noaa 1224 triggered the jet .    in order to clarify which of the ejections or the jet observed by soho ( figure 6 ) were related to the unusual burst , let us consider how the ejections and jet propagated .",
    "figures 8 and 9 present the motions of two ejections as well as the front of the jet according to lasco c2 and lasco c3 observations . from lasco c2 observations",
    "the front @xmath15 and the center @xmath16 of the first ejection moved in the plane of the sky as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the radial distance in units of the solar radius @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the time in minutes counted from 12:10 ut .",
    "at the same time according to lasco c3 data this propagation can be described as :    @xmath21    the above equations as well as the following ( equations ( [ eq5 ] )  ( [ eq13 ] ) ) are valid in the plane of the sky .",
    "the linear velocities of the front and the center of the first ejection derived from the above equations are , respectively , 344 km s@xmath0 and 340 km s@xmath0 near the sun ( lasco c2 ) and 284 km s@xmath0 and 298 km s@xmath0 far from the sun ( lasco c3 ) .",
    "it is seen that the first ejection decelerated with the distance , particularly the front of the ejection @xmath22 decelerated faster than the ejection center @xmath23 . at 12:10 , when the unusual burst started at a frequency of 22 mhz , the front of the first ejection was at @xmath24 and @xmath25 from the center of the sun in the plane of the sky according to lasco c2 and c3 respectively .",
    "taking into account that this ejection was initiated by active region noaa 1222 with a longitudinal angle @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is defined in figure 13 ) , the real radial distance from the front of the ejection to the center of the sun was @xmath28 ( for @xmath29 ) or @xmath30 ( for @xmath31 ) .",
    "at the same time the radio emission of the unusual burst appeared firstly on the spectra at 22 mhz ( at about 12:09:45 ut ) . assuming that this radio emission was generated at the second harmonic of the local plasma frequency and using the models of newkirk ( 1961 ) and baumbach - allen @xcite we can estimate that the radio source should be at @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , in these models .",
    "therefore we may suggest that the first ejection was very close to the place from which the radio emission of the unusual burst came out .",
    "equations which define the motion of the front @xmath34 and the center @xmath35 of the second ejection according to lasco c2 observations are the following :    @xmath36    and according to lasco c3 data :    @xmath37    velocities ( in the sky plane ) of the front and the center of the second ejection were 311 km s@xmath0 and 328 km s@xmath0 ( according to lasco c2 ) and 277 km s@xmath0 and 305 km s@xmath0 ( according to lasco c3 ) .",
    "for the second ejection the velocities of the front and the center of the ejection decreased with distance but only at the vicinity of the sun , whereas far from the sun the center moved faster than the front . as follows from equations ( [ eq5 ] )  ( [ eq8 ] ) and figure 8 the second ejection reached the estimated heights in the corona ( @xmath38 ) in 80 - 90 min after the beginning of the unusual burst .",
    "therefore we can conclude that this ejection did not cause the unusual radio burst .    the jet front propagated through the solar corona with a constant velocity of about 265 km s@xmath0 as seen in figure 9 ( taking into account the longitudinal angle @xmath39 of the active region noaa 1224 which was supposed to associate with the jet ) .",
    "the equation which describes the motion of the jet front in the sky plane is :    @xmath40    the distance from the front of the jet to the center of the sun at the time of the unusual radio burst was @xmath41 .",
    "this radial distance is close to those at which the radio emission at the second harmonic at 22 mhz can be generated .",
    "therefore the jet can be a source of the unusual radio burst too .",
    "nevertheless we suggest that the unusual burst was connected with the first ejection because in this case some properties of the burst can be explained easier .",
    "further we need to know the size of the first ejection at the time of the unusual burst radiation .",
    "figure 10 shows the dependence of the longitudinal @xmath42 and the transverse @xmath43 sizes of the ejection on the distance from the sun according to lasco c2 and c3 data . these dependencies for lasco c2 data",
    "can be formulated as follows :    @xmath44    and out of lasco c3 observations @xmath45    the velocity estimated from the longitudinal extension of the ejection is @xmath46 = 66.5 km s@xmath0 which is four times larger than the velocity derived from the transverse extension ( @xmath47 = 17.5 km s@xmath0 ) in the vicinity of the sun , whereas far from the sun @xmath46 = 35 km s@xmath0 and @xmath47 = 24.5 km s@xmath0 .",
    "the expansion velocities of the first ejection were smaller than the bulk velocity .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the density of the ejecta practically did not change during its movement .",
    "such situation is possible when the surface magnetic field of the ejecta restrains plasma from expanding into the surrounding coronal plasma .",
    "thus further we consider the ejection as a magnetic flux rope .",
    "we suppose that the magnetic flux rope was connected to the active region noaa 1222 . as it follows from stereo - a / euvi observations this region showed very high activity beginning from 11:36 ut .",
    "it manifested in increasing its brightness and size as well as in the appearance of arches related to this region .",
    "these processes lasted for about 2 h. supposing that the magnetic flux rope moved radially from the active region with the longitude angle @xmath27 and using equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) we derive the following equations which describe the motions of the front @xmath48 and center @xmath49 of the ejection    @xmath50    the magnetic flux rope was formed approximately at 11:36 ut ( at the very beginning of noaa 1222 activity ) at longitudes @xmath26 ( according to equation ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath51 min ) near the surface of the sun .",
    "the central part of the flux rope appeared in 6 min , _ i.e. _ at 11:42 ut . according to equation",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) and taking into account the angle @xmath52 the longitudinal size of the magnetic flux rope was @xmath53 at the time of its formation .",
    "velocities of its front and center were , respectively , 450 km s@xmath0 and 443 km s@xmath0 at @xmath29 and 535 km s@xmath0 and 528 km",
    "s@xmath0 at @xmath31 .",
    "the ejection front was located at @xmath54 from the center of the sun at the beginning of the unusual burst , _",
    "i.e. _ at 12:10 ut ( see figure 11 ) .",
    "as was discussed in section 3 , at these heights the local plasma frequency is about 11 mhz .",
    "therefore the magnetic flux rope at these altitudes can be a source of radio emission at the second harmonic , 22 mhz .",
    "langmuir waves required for the generation of the radio emission through the plasma mechanism can be excited by electrons which are accelerated during the interaction of the moving magnetic flux rope with the surrounding coronal plasma . in the case when the magnetic field of the flux rope was perpendicular to the rope axis",
    "the electrons can be accelerated along the flux rope , for example , by the lorentz force @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the transverse velocity of the magnetic flux rope and @xmath57 is the magnetic field of the flux rope ( see figure 12a ) .",
    "the other possible acceleration process is magnetic reconnection ( figure 12b ) when the magnetic field of the flux rope was oriented along the direction of the propagation of the flux rope . at the constant acceleration along the flux",
    "rope the electrons can reach the velocity @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the length of the flux rope and @xmath60 is the acceleration time .",
    "assuming that the acceleration time is approximately equal to the duration of the unusual radio burst and taking into account that the length of the flux rope is @xmath61 at radial distances of @xmath62 we can estimate the velocities of fast electrons as @xmath63 cm s@xmath0 .",
    "these electrons can propagate towards and away from the sun .",
    "electrons moving through the coronal plasma generate langmuir waves @xmath64 which in the process @xmath65",
    "( @xmath66 means ion ) are transformed into electromagnetic waves @xmath20 at the first harmonic . in the process",
    "@xmath67 the langmuir waves are merged into electromagnetic waves at the second harmonic @xcite .",
    "the radio emission at the first harmonic generated in a behind - the - limb region can not propagate toward the earth . at the same time the second harmonic of the behind - the - limb radio emission can be observed on the earth ( see the appendix ) . in the newkirk model of coronal density , the radio emission at the second harmonic has a strong cut - off at the frequency @xmath68 ( see equation ( [ a4 ] ) ) . for the active regions with the longitudinal angle @xmath69",
    "this frequency is @xmath70 mhz .",
    "it is the same frequency at which the unusual radio burst had a clear cut - off ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "we propose the following explanation of this cut - off of the caterpillar burst at 27.5 mhz .",
    "electrons which were accelerated by the magnetic flux rope at @xmath71 towards the sun generate the radio emission of the unusual burst which drifted from @xmath72 mhz up to @xmath73 mhz .",
    "the radio emission could not propagate through the solar corona in the direction to the earth at frequencies @xmath74 mhz . at the same time electrons accelerated by the magnetic flux rope away from the sun",
    "produced the radio emission of the unusual burst which drifted to low frequencies from 22 mhz to 16 mhz ( according data of utr-2 and uran-2 ) and down to 1 mhz ( according to the stereo a data ) .",
    "as was mentioned in section [ telescopes ] , one of the interesting properties of the caterpillar burst is its unusual frequency drift . in particular , the frequency drift was positive at frequencies higher than 22 mhz and its rate was about 500 mhz s@xmath0 , whereas at frequencies lower than 22 mhz the unusual burst exhibited negative frequency drift with the rate of about 100 mhz s@xmath0 .",
    "the particles accelerated by the flux rope may produce the radio emission which will be observed with the following frequency drift rate    @xmath75    where @xmath76 is the electron velocity , @xmath77 is the speed of light , and @xmath78 is the plasma density . using the newkirk model we derive from equation ( [ eq16 ] ) in the case of the second harmonic of radio emission the following values for the electron velocities : @xmath79 cm s@xmath0 and @xmath80 cm s@xmath0 for the observed drift rates @xmath81 khz s@xmath0 and @xmath82 khz s@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "these velocities are close to those obtained for the acceleration of electrons by the magnetic flux rope .",
    "our observations showed a fine structure of the unusual burst in the form of stripes ( figure 2 ) .",
    "these stripes had a longer duration than the striae of type iiib bursts .",
    "their frequency bandwidths are 6 - 8 times broader than the bandwidths of striae , _",
    "i.e. _ 300 - 400 khz for the unusual radio burst contrary to 50 - 70 khz bandwidth of the type iiib stria @xcite .",
    "additionally in contrast to type iiib bursts with a nearly constant frequency drift of the striae , the drift rate of the unusual burst stripes changed during the stripe ( figure 2 ) .",
    "we believe that the discussed stripes were related to an inhomogeneity of coronal plasma .",
    "this idea is analogous to the hypothesis proposed by according to which the type iiib stria radio emission may be explained as an amplification of the radio emission by irregularities in the solar corona , for example , by the filaments .",
    "has considered the propagation of the fast electron beams in a plasma with density fluctuations and has shown that the langmuir turbulence generated by electrons is higher in the low plasma density regions .",
    "therefore , we can also expect more intense radio emission at regions of low density .",
    "the size of inhomogeneties which are responsible for the enhancement of the radio stripes of the unusual burst can be derived from the frequency bandwidth defined by    @xmath83    from equation ( [ eq17 ] ) we obtain the following size of inhomogeneities @xmath84 . thus we can conclude that the electron beams propagate through essentially non - homogeneous plasma . note that an analogous result was derived for wide - band fibers , the fine structure elements of decameter type ii bursts @xcite .",
    "proposing that the radio emission of the unusual burst was generated by the particles accelerated by the magnetic flux rope it is reasonable to accept that the transverse size @xmath85 of the volume of the accelerated particles is equal to the transverse size of the magnetic flux rope at the radial distances from which the radio emission comes out . from equation ( [ eq11 ] ) we derive that @xmath86 . taking into account that the maximum flux of the unusual burst was about @xmath87 s.f.u .",

    "the unusual burst observed by radio telescopes utr-2 and uran-2 at frequencies 16 - 27 mhz had the following properties :    1 .",
    "radio emission came out from a behind - the - limb region .",
    "the burst has some unusual properties which are not typical for other known solar bursts .",
    "in particular , * the frequency drift rate was negative at low frequencies and positive at high frequencies ; * the frequency drift rate changed in the range from 100 khz s@xmath0 to 500 khz s@xmath0 ; * the burst disappeared at frequencies @xmath95 mhz , _",
    "i.e. _ it showed strong frequency cut - off effect ; * the total duration of the burst ( 50 s - 80 s ) was longer than that for the usual type iii bursts ; * the burst had a fine structure in the form of stripes with frequency bandwidth @xmath96 khz ; 3 .",
    "the polarization of the burst was about 10% , which corresponded to the second harmonic of radio emission .",
    "the radio flux of the burst attained @xmath97 s.f.u .",
    "the unusual burst was observed at a frequency as low as 1 mhz ( stereo / waves data ) .",
    "we propose the following scenario of the generation of the caterpillar burst .",
    "the unusual burst was associated with active region noaa1222 which started to be active at about 11:36 ut .",
    "the magnetic flux rope , which believed to be associated with this activity , propagated radially with a velocity of about 500 km s@xmath0 away from the sun . at heights @xmath98",
    "the magnetic flux rope accelerated electrons .",
    "moving towards and away from the sun these particles generated the radio emission which was observed as the unusual radio burst .",
    "the particles propagating towards the sun produced the radio emission with drift from low to high frequencies whereas particles moving away from the sun generated the radio emission drifting from high to low frequencies .",
    "the velocities of the accelerated particles changed from @xmath99 cm s@xmath0 to @xmath100 cm s@xmath0 . at frequencies",
    "@xmath101 mhz the unusual burst was not observed because its radio emission could not propagate through the plasma of the solar corona towards the earth .",
    "the work was partially fulfilled in the frame of fp7 project solspanet ( fp7-people-2010-irses-269299 ) .",
    "m. panchenko acknowledges the austrian fond zur foerderung der wissenschaftlichen forschung ( fwf projects p23762-n16 ) .",
    "here we discuss the possibility for the radio emission at the second harmonic of local plasma frequency to propagate from the behind - the - limb region of the sun towards the earth .",
    "as was discussed in the present paper the unusual burst seems to be generated at the second harmonic of local plasma frequency .",
    "this follows from low degree of polarization of the unusual radio burst which was about 10% .",
    "note that the fundamental radio emission had higher degree of polarization ( type iiib bursts have 60 - 80% ) .",
    "let us discuss in detail the possibility to detect the radio emission at the second harmonic propagating from a behind - the - limb region by a ground - based radio telescope .",
    "figure 13 presents the scheme of such propagation .",
    "the radio source is situated at a distance @xmath102 from the solar center with the longitude @xmath27 .",
    "the second harmonic can propagate towards the earth if the distance @xmath103 is larger than the distance @xmath104 .",
    "the last quantity corresponds to the radial distance at which the local plasma frequency @xmath105 in the solar corona equals the double plasma frequency @xmath106 at the place of generation of the second harmonic @xmath107 .",
    "therefore the condition for the observation of the behind - the - limb radio emission is @xmath108 in the opposite case , when @xmath109 , the radio emission at the second harmonic can not propagate towards the earth .",
    "therefore we can define the regions in the  frequency - longitudinal angle \" plane where the radio emission at the second harmonic can propagate toward the earth . in the case of the baumbach - allen model",
    "the emission can be detected at the earth if the source is at the longitudinal angles @xmath120 .",
    "moreover the radio emission can be observed in the whole frequency range ( figure 14 , to the left from the dashed line ) .    if the coronal density follows the newkirk model the higher possible frequency ( or higher cut - off frequency ) of the radio emission at the second harmonic detected at the earth depends on the longitudinal angle @xmath27 ( figure 14 , solid line ) .",
    "therefore in this case the radio emission can be observed in regions to the left of the solid line in figure 14 .",
    "this line is defined by        assuming that the source of the unusual radio burst was related to active region noaa1222 , which was located at the longitudinal angles @xmath124 , and using equation ( [ a2 ] ) we derive the distances at which the second harmonic emission can come out .",
    "these distances are @xmath125 ( for @xmath126 ) and @xmath127 ( for @xmath128 ) .",
    "maximal frequencies of the radio emission that are able to come out from these heights are 37 mhz and 12.7 mhz respectively .",
    "the cut - off frequency @xmath129 mhz corresponds to the height @xmath130 is the highest frequency of the observed unusual radio burst ."
