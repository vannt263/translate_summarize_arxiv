    "the production of heavy quarkonia at hadron colliders is a unique laboratory for studies of the interplay between the perturbative treatment of hard subprocesses and nonperturbative hadronization models .",
    "thanks to the hierarchy @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass of the heavy quark @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the asymptotic scale parameter of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the nonrelativistic - qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization hypothesis @xcite ( see also the recent reviews in ref .",
    "@xcite ) allows one to factorize the effects of short and long distances and to parametrize the latter in terms of a few long - distance matrix elements ( ldmes ) .",
    "while color - singlet ( cs ) ldmes are calculable in potential models @xcite , the only way to extract color - octet ( co ) ldmes available so far is to fit them to experimental data .",
    "this implies that , to reliably check the validity of nrqcd factorization and the universality of the ldmes , one has to know the short - distance parts of the cross sections as precisely as possible .",
    "the hadroproduction of heavy quarkonia is presently being studied in a wide range of transverse momentum ( @xmath4 ) and both at central and forward rapidities ( @xmath12 ) . to provide a uniform and accurate description of the short - distance parts of the cross sections",
    "is a challenging task even with state - of - the - art techniques in perturbative qcd .",
    "three characteristic @xmath4 regions can be identified . in the region @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the heavy - quarkonium mass , sudakov - type double logarithms @xmath15",
    "spoil the convergence of the perturbative series in @xmath2 and have to be resummed to reproduce the physical behavior of the cross section @xcite .",
    "moreover , small-@xmath16 physics effects , such as the saturation of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) , can start to play a role there .",
    "in fact , at @xmath5  tev , @xmath16 values as small as @xmath17 contribute to the lowest @xmath4 bins for the rapidities covered by the lhcb detector @xcite . at @xmath18 ,",
    "fragmentation logarithms @xmath19 appear , and the description in terms of fragmentation functions , evolving with the energy scale , appears to be more appropriate @xcite . in some intermediate @xmath4 region , fixed - order calculations within the collinear parton model ( cpm ) should be valid . in the cpm , the complete next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) results for inclusive heavy - quarkonium production are available @xcite .",
    "the real - radiation part of the next - to - next - to - leading - order corrections to cs production was found to be sizable @xcite , even taking into account the large uncertainties due to the infrared cutoff scale .",
    "the above - mentioned approaches appear to describe well the @xmath4 distributions measured in the respective regions .",
    "however , there is dramatic disagreement between the co ldme sets extracted in different fits .",
    "moreover , while a self - consistent description of all the experimental data of prompt @xmath20 hadroproduction and photoproduction is possible at nlo in the cpm @xcite , the ldmes thus obtained lead to disagreement with the polarization measurements @xcite . a similar ,",
    "albeit less severe tension between the descriptions of yield and polarization was also observed for bottomonia @xcite . this problem is usually referred to as the _ heavy - quarkonium polarization puzzle_.    in view of the difficult situation described above , an approach which is equally appropriate on theoretical grounds both for the small- and large-@xmath4 regions is required .",
    "such an approach can be designed on the basis of the @xmath21 factorization formalism @xcite implemented with pdfs unintegrated over @xmath4 ( unpdfs ) , which naturally regularizes the small-@xmath4 divergences that are present in fixed - order calculations within the cpm .",
    "the gauge independence of the hard - scattering matrix elements is , in general , broken by the virtuality of the initial - state gluons . to restore it",
    ", one can treat them as reggeized gluons ( reggeons ) , which are the natural gauge - independent degrees of freedom of high - energy qcd .",
    "they were first introduced in the context of the balitsky - fadin - kuraev - lipatov ( bfkl ) @xcite evolution equation and later promoted to the level of dynamical fields in lipatov s effective action for the high - energy limit of qcd @xcite .",
    "we denote the combination of the @xmath21 factorization formalism for the cross sections with the reggeization of partons in the initial state of the hard - scattering amplitudes as the parton reggeization approach ( pra ) .",
    "presently , unpdfs are not so much constrained as collinear pdfs .",
    "however , there exists a method to obtain unpdfs from collinear ones , the kimber - martin - ryskin ( kmr ) @xcite model , which has produced stable and consistent results in many phenomenological applications . besides numerous applications to charmonium @xcite and bottomonium production @xcite",

    "we concentrate on the production of radially excited charmonium [ @xmath0 ] and bottomonium [ @xmath1 ] states .",
    "this has the advantage that the feed - down contributions are negligibly small and so allows for direct tests of the underlying production mechanisms .",
    "the recent experimental data on the unpolarized @xmath0 yields from atlas @xcite and cms @xcite cover a wide @xmath4 range and , in combination with cdf @xcite and lhcb @xcite data at smaller @xmath4 values , allow us to quantitatively study the relative importance of the fusion and fragmentation production mechanisms .",
    "measurements of @xmath20 production from @xmath0 decay by cdf @xcite and atlas @xcite enable us to test a simple model of the feed - down kinematics @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we exploit @xmath0 polarization data from cdf @xcite and cms @xcite to address the question if the pra can shed light on the notorious charmonium polarization puzzle . in the @xmath1 case",
