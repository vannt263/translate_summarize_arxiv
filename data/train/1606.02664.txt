    "one of the most practical applications of quantum information science is the so - called quantum key distribution ( qkd ) protocol , which allows two remote parties , normally referred to as alice and bob , to generate a secure key through an insecure quantum channel @xcite .",
    "the generated key can be further applied in other cryptographic protocols to enhance communication security .    in the first qkd protocol , the bennett and brassard 1984 ( bb84 ) qkd protocol @xcite",
    ", information is carried by single - photon signals . due to the channel loss and other implementation imperfections ,",
    "those single - photon signals are detected in a probabilistic fashion with a relatively high quantum bit error rate ( qber ) in the order of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to a classical optical communication system , where information can be transmitted deterministically in an almost error - free fashion .",
    "furthermore , specialized devices , such as single photons detectors , are typically required in qkd .",
    "this makes qkd a very different communication modality in comparison with classical communication .",
    "more recently , continuous - variable ( cv ) qkd protocols based on optical coherent detection have been proposed and demonstrated as viable solutions @xcite . in an optical coherent receiver , a strong laser pulse called local oscillator ( lo )",
    "is mixed with the incoming signal at a beam splitter .",
    "the resulting interference signal is strong enough and can be detected using highly efficient photo - diodes working at room temperature .",
    "the strong lo also acts as a natural and extremely selective filter , which can effectively suppress broadband noise photons generated in the communication channel .",
    "this intrinsic filtering function is especially useful when conducting qkd over a noisy channel , such as a lit fiber in a conventional fiber optic network @xcite or a free - space optical link @xcite .",
    "one well - known cv - qkd protocol is the gaussian - modulated coherent states ( gmcs ) protocol @xcite , which has been demonstrated over @xmath2 km telecom fiber @xcite and in a real - world cv - qkd network @xcite .",
    "the hardware required for implementing the gmcs qkd is surprisingly similar to that for classical coherent optical communication @xcite .",
    "in fact , recent progresses in both communities have significantly reduced the gap between them . on one hand ,",
    "the continuous improvement of detector performance and the development of forward - error - correction coding in classical coherent communication allows a bit error rate ( ber ) of @xmath0 with only a few photons per bit @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "cv - qkd protocols based on discrete modulation scheme , which are similar to the binary phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) and the quadrature phase - shift keying ( qpsk ) in classical communication , have been proposed @xcite .",
    "it is feasible to use the same communication infrastructure for either classical communication or qkd in a time - sharing manner .    in this paper , we go one step further by showing it is possible to conduct classical communication and qkd _ simultaneously_. as a specific example , we propose a coherent communication scheme where both the bits for classical communication and the gaussian distributed random numbers for gmcs qkd are encoded on the _ same _ weak coherent pulse , and decoded by the _",
    "same _ coherent receiver .",
    "such a scheme could be appealing in practice , where random numbers for qkd are superimposed on classical communication signals , and secure key distribution is conducted in the background of classical communication at a minimal cost .",
    "our protocol is a special case of the more general concept of simultaneous transmission of classical and quantum information @xcite .",
    "the trade - off relations for public communication , privacy communication and secure key generation have been derived in @xcite assuming no feedback from the receiver to the sender .",
    "it could be interesting to extend the results in @xcite to the gmcs qkd using reverse reconciliation .",
    "this work is partly inspired by @xcite , where the authors propose improved schemes to implement cv - qkd using a _ locally _ generated lo @xcite .",
    "one scheme proposed in @xcite is to estimate the phase difference between two remote lasers by sending gaussian modulated coherent states displaced in phase space . in our scheme ,",
    "we encode classical information on the displacements of qkd signals .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec:2 ] , we present details of the proposed protocol . in section [ sec:3 ] , we conduct numerical simulations based on practical system parameters .",
    "finally , we conclude this paper with a discussion in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "for simplicity , in this paper we assume the bpsk scheme and the gmcs protocol are adopted in classical communication and qkd , correspondingly .",
    "the basic idea should be applicable in other encoding schemes .      in the bpsk modulation scheme ,",
    "the classical binary information is encoded on the phase of a coherent state , and decoded by performing optical homodyne detection .",
    "more specifically , the bit value @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) is encoded by @xmath5 , as shown in fig.1(a ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume @xmath6 is a real number .",
    "the average photon number @xmath7 of the coherent state is given by @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the x - quadrature of the signal is measured by the receiver .",
    "the probability distribution of the measurement result @xmath9 is shown in fig.1(a ) ( right figure ) .",
    "the receiver can decode binary information using the sign of @xmath9 , i.e. , if @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) , the bit value is assigned as `` 0 '' ( `` 1 '' ) .",
    "the ber of the bpsk scheme is determined by the measurement error variance @xmath12 and the signal amplitude @xmath6 , and is given by @xcite [ eq1 ] ber = erfc()where @xmath13 is the channel transmittance , @xmath14 is the detection efficiency , and erfc ( * ) denotes the complementary error function . if the homodyne detector is shot - noise limited ( the technical noise is much lower than the vacuum noise ) , then @xmath12 is about 1/4 . from ( 1 ) , we need about 9 photons per bit at the receiver s end to achieve a ber of @xmath0 .          in gmcs",
    "qkd , alice prepares coherent states @xmath15 and sends them to bob through a quantum channel . here",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath17 are gaussian random numbers with zero mean and a variance of @xmath18 , where @xmath19 = 1/4 denotes the shot - noise variance . in this paper ,",
    "all the noise variances are defined in the shot - noise unit . at bob s end",
    ", he can either perform optical homodyne detection to measure a randomly chosen quadrature @xcite , or perform optical heterodyne detection to measure both quadratures simultaneously @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "our discussion is based on the homodyne detection scheme .",
    "the essential ideas can be extended to the other case .",
    "fig.1(b ) shows the phase space representation of gaussian modulated coherent states .",
    "given the system is shot - noise limited , the overall quadrature variance at the receiver s end is @xmath20 .",
    "after quantum transmission stage , bob announces which quadrature he measures for each incoming signal through an authenticated classical channel , and alice only keeps the corresponding data .",
    "if the observed noise is below certain threshold , they can further work out a secure key by performing reconciliation and privacy amplification .",
    "see more details in section iii .",
    "it is straightforward to combine the above two communication protocols . in this simultaneous classical communication and qkd scheme ,",
    "alice encodes her classical bit @xmath3 and gaussian random numbers @xmath21 on a coherent state @xmath22 , as shown in fig.1(c ) .",
    "note in the gmcs qkd based on homodyne detection , bob measures either x or p quadrature of each incoming signal . to achieve deterministic classical communication ,",
    "the same classical bit @xmath3 is encoded on both x and p quadrature .",
    "if heterodyne detection scheme is employed , then alice only needs to encode @xmath3 on one quadrature .",
    "assume bob measures x - quadrature ( p - quadrature ) and his measurement result is @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "bob determines a classical bit @xmath25 using the sign of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , i.e. , if @xmath26 , then the value of @xmath25 is assigned as `` 0 '' .",
    "otherwise , the value of @xmath25 is assigned as `` 1 '' . to generate secure key , the measurement result will be rescaled and displaced based on the overall transmittance @xmath27 and the value of @xmath25 as follows [ eq2 ] x_b & = & + ( 2m_b-1 ) + p_b & = & + ( 2m_b-1)alice and bob can further work out a secure key from raw keys @xmath28 and @xmath29 , just as in the case of conventional gmcs qkd .",
    "essentially , the states prepared by alice are displaced gaussian modulated coherent states , where the amount of displacement is determined by the classical bit @xmath3 . given a modulation variance @xmath30 , the ber of classical communication can be reduced effectively by increasing the displacement @xmath6 .",
    "next , we will show that the security proofs of the standard gmcs qkd can be applied to this new scheme . to illustrate the essential ideas , it is convenient to represent the classical communication and qkd using two separate channels , and allow eve to have full access and control of information transmitted through the classical channel , as shown in fig.2 ( a ) . in this picture",
    ", bob performs a homodyne measurement on the incoming signal , then displaces his measurement results using classical information @xmath25 ( which could be provided by eve ) .",
    "equivalently , bob could perform the displacement operation first , then perform the homodyne measurement , as shown in fig.2 ( b ) .",
    "finally , if we move the displacement operation out of bob s secure station and let eve to have full control of it ( see fig.2 ( c ) ) , then the whole system reduces to the standard gmcs qkd , where eve is allowed to manipulate the quantum signals transmitted through the channel at her will .",
    "note , in the last step , we have given eve additional power to control the displacement operation , so the security of the proposed scheme is at least as strong as the standard gmcs qkd .",
    "in next section , we conduct numerical simulations to estimate the performance of the proposed scheme .",
    "to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme , we conduct numerical simulations using practical system parameters .",
    "on one hand , since the quantum signal is superimposed on a relatively strong classical signal , we expect that noises from the classical channel will be coupled into the quantum channel and reduce the qkd performance . on the other hand , the gaussian modulation in qkd will also appear as a noise source in classical communication channel .",
    "we first evaluate the performance of the classical communication .",
    "the main noise sources in classical channel are : ( 1 ) the vacuum noise with a variance of one ; ( 2 ) the detector noise denoted by @xmath31 ; and ( 3 ) the gaussian modulation for qkd with a variance of @xmath30 .",
    "all the above noises are defined in the shot - noise unit and are assumed to be independent gaussian noises with zero mean .",
    "note the first two are defined at the receiver s side , while the third is defined at the sender s side . as we will show below , to achieve a positive key rate in qkd , the excess noise due to phase instability and other modulation imperfections",
    "should be much smaller than the vacuum noise .",
    "so we neglect the phase noise in classical communication .",
    "we assume the communication channel is optical fiber with an attenuation coefficient of @xmath32 .",
    "the channel transmittance is given by [ eq3 ] t_ch=10^where @xmath33 is the fiber length .    from ( 1 ) , the ber of classical communication is given by [ eq4 ] ber = erfc ( )    to achieve a ber of @xmath0 in the classical channel , the required displacement @xmath6 is [ eq5 ] = 4.24 .",
    "we conduct numerical simulation to calculate the required displacement @xmath6 as a function of the fiber length using ( 5 ) .",
    "simulation parameters are @xmath34 , @xmath35 db / km , @xmath36 , @xmath37 .",
    "the simulation results are shown in fig.3 .     to achieve a ber of @xmath0 in the classical channel .",

    "fig.3 shows that @xmath38 for a typical @xmath30 in the range of 1 to 20 .",
    "the presence of this relatively large displacement not only requires a large dynamic range of the detector , but also makes the qkd performance more sensitive to the phase noise . we will study these issues in details below .    the expected quadrature distribution at the receiver s end is shown in fig.4 , where @xmath39 is the reduced displacement at receiver s end and @xmath40 is the expected variance associated with the gaussian modulation . due to the finite dynamic ranges of electrical amplifiers and analog to digital converter ( adc )",

    "an uncoded bpsk system requires at least 9 photons per pulse to achieve the same ber .",

    "a 1 ghz shot - noise limited homodyne detector has been applied in a recently cv - qkd experiment @xcite .",
