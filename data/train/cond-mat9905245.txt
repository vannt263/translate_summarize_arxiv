    "the wide band gap semiconductor gan has experienced exciting applications in blue light emitting diodes and laser diodes . for a further improvement of the quality of the material a better understanding of the structural and electronic properties",

    "the energetic positions of critical points differ by 0.8 ev for the existing band structure calculations of wurtzite gan @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the geometrical structure of the gan(0001 ) surface is still being debated @xcite .",
    "the most powerful tool for examining the electronic structure of semiconductors is the angle resolved ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy ( arups ) .",
    "the spectra give insight into the valence band structure of the bulk as well as the surface .",
    "besides the part of direct interest , i.e. the initial bound state , the photoemission process also involves the excitation to outgoing scattering states with the transition probability given by matrix elements .",
    "therefore , as already demonstrated for the cubic gan(001 ) surface @xcite , a full account of the experimental data can only be attained by a comparison with photocurrents calculated within the one - step model .    as a starting point",
    "we use a gan(0001)-(1x1):ga surface , as it is predicted by total energy calculations performed within the local density formalism @xcite .",
    "the calculated photoemission spectra in normal emission are examined with respect to contributions from the bulk band structure as well as from surface states .",
    "for example , we identify a structure near the lower valence band edge as resulting from a surface state . only by taking this state into account",
    ", the correct energetic position of the band edge can be extracted .",
    "based on the detailed understanding of the photocurrent the flexibility of the calculation allows us to adjust the underlying bulk band structure to the experimental results .",
    "this means that we are able to correct the position of the valence band maximum , which is an important value for determining band offsets and band bending .",
    "though abandoning parameter - free modeling thereby , one gains experience how peaks are shifted and intensities are deformed by the matrix elements .",
    "the true position of the bands can be much better determined in such an interpretation of experiment than using standard band mapping methods .",

    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first a short overview about the theory is given , followed by a detailed analysis of the initial surface band structure and the used final bands .",

    "it is shown how the theoretical band structure calculation can be related to experiment and how uncertainties in the experimental interpretation can be removed .",
    "finally , we present the results for off - normal emission , comparing with experimental data , too .",

    "it takes into account relaxation and reconstruction at the surface .",
    "the resolution of the dos with respect to atomic layers and orbital composition allows for a detailed characterization of the bands and their corresponding photocurrents .",
    "the final state of photoemission is a scattering state with asymptotic boundary conditions . for a clean surface its wave function",

    "the leading peak between -1.0 and -0.3 ev in both theoretical series can be identified with the experimental structure between -2.0 and -1.2 ev .",

    "the theoretical band edge is found at 0.8 ev lower binding energy , and additionally , the variation of the intensity with photon energy is associated with the matrix elements and uniquely attributes this emission to a surface state .",

    "the association of a non - dispersive structure with a theoretically estimated band edge merely because of its energetical vicinity can easily lead to erroneous band mapping @xcite , especially as surface states often develop near band edges .    summarizing the above discussion",
    ", we have demonstrated that there is a clear aggrement between the theoretical and experimental results for a wide energy range .",
    "this aggrement allows us to show that the determination of the vbm by extrapolating the leading edge could involve significant errors .",

    "the energetic difference between the two experimental structures coincides in @xmath9 with the theoretical valence band width of 7.2 ev and underlines the results from section c.    for angles above @xmath33 the experimental data display a shoulder between -1.0 and -2.0 ev .",
    "this emission can be associated with structure ( b ) in theory . for @xmath34 and @xmath27",
    "the shoulder becomes very broad , which may be attributed to the theoretical emissions ( b ) and ( a ) .",

    "the theoretical spectra show a further emission from a surface state ( i ) .",
    "this emission might be identified with the high binding energy shoulder in the experimental data near -9.0 ev . around -4.0",
    "ev , the experiment shows two dispersing structures .",
    "these structures can be connected with the theoretical emissions ( e ) and ( f ) which appear to be weaker , however .",
    "also the structure ( g ) is seen in experiment as a weak shoulder at low emission angles . between -4.0 and -5.0",
    "ev the experiment shows a structure ( @xmath35 = @xmath26 ... @xmath36 ) not being marked which is related to the theoretical structure ( h ) .",
    "thus three surface states and several surface resonances can be identified in experiment .",
    "taking into account the influence of the topmost atomic layers to the photocurrent ( see section d ) the coincidence of the theoretical and experimental spectra confirm the used surface geometry .",
    "moreover , considering the energetic shift of 1.0 ev , the energetic positions of the structures confirm the used surface band structure .",

    "[ ganoberband ] ) delayed by @xmath37 with respect to experiment , where this band clearly appears already at @xmath33 with very low dispersion .",
    "this difference is a hint that the theoretical surface band ( c ) becomes free of the projected bulk band structure with smaller dispersion along @xmath19 and significant closer to the @xmath9 point than obtained in our surface band structure calculation . in the same energy range but for lower angles ,",
    "a shoulder is marked in the spectra which is comparable with the structure ( c ) in theory .",
    "near -2.0 ev experiment marks a structure , dispersing a little to higher binding energy for larger angles .",
    "this structure can be identified with the theoretical emission ( c ) , visible for angles between @xmath26 and @xmath38 .",
    "the experimental structure disperses from -2.0 ev to -3.0 ev , while the theoretical structure disperses from -0.9 ev to -2.4 ev at @xmath38 . above @xmath33",
    "the experiment shows no peaks for this structure , but only shoulders .",
    "the theoretical curves show the structures ( d ) and ( e ) , which explains for higher angles these shoulders and the adjacent experimental peaks on the higher binding energy side .",
    "below @xmath33 structure ( e ) reproduces the dispersive experimental structure between -2.6 and -5.6 ev . different from experimental data , the emission ( e ) is less pronounced and displays less dispersion ( about 300 mev ) . at still lower angles a weak emission ( h )",
    "is seen , which is visible as a weak structure in the experimental data . near the lower valence band edge , theory shows three structures ( g , g and i ) which can be compared with the experimental structure around -8 ev .",
    "it displays similar behavior as the theoretical data with respect to dispersion and magnitude , though the experimental emissions are weaker .",
    "summarizing , we are able to explain all observed experimental structures .",
    "the observed energetical positions underline our result in normal emission , namely that the band width is 7.2 ev and that the experimental valence band maximum has to be shifted for 1.0 ev to higher binding energies .",
    "in addition to direct transitions all emissions in off - normal emission are influenced by surface states and resonances , as has been verified by the layer resolved photocurrent .",
    "this demonstrates the surface sensitivity of the experiment , misleading the mapping of valence bulk bands solely from off - normal measurements @xcite .",
    "also , we are able to identify three surface emissions , which show the same energetical and intensity behaviour in theory and experiment . they can be related to emissions from the topmost nitrogen @xmath15 and gallium @xmath6 and @xmath13 orbitals .",
    "the theoretical dispersion is only slightly at variance with experiment .",
    "the emissions from the topmost atomic layers sensitively depend on surface structure and reconstruction .",
    "thus the comparison between experimental and theoretical results confirms the reliability of the assumed theoretical surface model .",
    "photoemission spectra in normal and off - normal emission for the gan(0001)-(1x1):ga surface have been calculated within the one - step model .",
    "normal emission spectra show emissions from a surface state near the lower valence band edge .",
    "it is identified by its energetic position different from the band edge and its varying intensity by inspection of the matrix elements .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that a widespread experimental method to determine the vbm by extrapolating the leading edge of the valence band spectra may fail by as much as 1.0 ev . taking this into account",
    "all the experimental structures can be identified in close agreement with theory .",
    "especially , the valence band width ( 7.2 ev ) agrees with a lda bulk band structure calculation of vogel _ et al . _ whereas a gw calculation of rubio _ et al . _",
    "differs by 0.8 ev .    in off - normal emission",
    ", surface states near the upper valence band edge can be identified and analyzed with respect to surface band structures .",
    "several surface resonances are examined and verified by experimental data .",
    "aggrement of surface specific properties in the theoretical and experimental photocurrents is seen as a proof of the used surface geometry .",
    "the surface is nitrogen terminated with a gallium adlayer .",
    "the experimental emissions are traced back by theory to their origin in band structure , electronic states , orbital composition and location in direct space .",
    "thus the one - step model calculation is a powerful tool to yield essential insight into the bulk and surface electronic structure .",
    "in addition , it gives credit to the underlying surface geometry .",
