    "to understand subsequent arpes data , we first review how commensurate rotations determine the band structure of rotated graphene . using the notation of mele,@xcite a commensurate rotation is determined by the supercell vector @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are integers and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the unit cell vectors of graphene .",

    "[ f : supercell](c ) .",

    "they use a continuum approximation to describe the large range of interlayer bonding geometries in the large supercells that result from a relative rotation . by assuming that the interlayer hopping has a long wavelength nature",
    "so that the coupling between different valleys ( @xmath3 and @xmath45 ) can be ignored , they treat the interlayer coupling as being uniform .",

    "we now describe exactly how commensurate rotation angles are measured in arpes .        within the detector area of an arpes measurement at @xmath54ev ,",
    "dirac cones from graphene sheets with relative rotations angles of @xmath55 are visible .",
    "some of the visible cones come from different uncorrelated rotated domains , i.e from a continuous graphene film that has an induced rotational boundary , @xmath56 , caused by pleats in the graphene or by substrate step edges , etc . that are within the @xmath57 beam diameter .",
    "to distinguish the commensurate pairs formed by stacked rotated graphene sheets from incoherent pairs formed from pleats and steps , etc . , we take advantage of the fact that in arpes the photo - emitted electron can diffract from the local surface structure .",
    "if there is no superlattice , as in the case of cones from two incoherent rotational domains , there will be * no * diffraction .",
    "on the other hand if the cones are from a coherent bilayer pair that form a superlattice , additional replica cones caused by diffraction will be visible in arpes .",
    "this diffraction effect has been nicely demonstrated for graphene grown on the si - face of sic where a @xmath58  superstructure causes replica dirac cones at @xmath41-vectors relative to the main graphene dirac cones [ see refs .   and ] . in the case of c - face graphene ,",
    "the apres signature of two stacked commensurately rotated graphene sheets will not only be the two primary dirac cones but will also include replica ( diffraction ) cones positioned at @xmath59 relative to either of the primary cones [ see fig .",

    "first , it must be emphasized that surface effects can not be the source of the inconsistency between theoretical predictions for @xmath5 and the values measured in these experiments .",
    "this is because , even in thick meg films ( @xmath83 layers ) , infrared absorption experiments measure the same velocity.@xcite    a more important consideration is the valid energy range where renormalization is significant .",
    "models differ in the energy range where the renormalized velocity prediction is expected to be valid .",

    "the distortion due to the fermi - dirac function near @xmath90 mean that it is difficult to accurately fit the position of the two converging @xmath94 bands .",
    "a more important observation is that the measured velocity does not go to zero at @xmath87 as it should if there was a van hove singularity at the @xmath10-point .",

    "first , the moir patterns of graphene on graphite are not necessarily due to simply sheet rotations .",
    "for example , surface graphite moir patterns are the result of a mechanically distorted top layer formed during cleaving of graphite.@xcite similar distortions and buckling are seen in depositing exfoliated graphene onto a support substrate .",
    "the consensus understanding is that these moir patterns are not caused by the relative rotation of a graphene sheets.@xcite in other words , it is possible to have a moir pattern without rotations .",
    "furthermore , the moir corrugation amplitude in graphene on graphite films is typically @xmath100 [ see pong and durkan  @xcite and references therein ] .",
    "this should be compared to meg films where the corrugation is less than 0.2,@xcite height modulations that are more than a third of the graphene interlayer are certainly not part of the any of the models discussed above and therefore make a comparison between theories based on flat rotated sheets questionable .",
    "it has also been argued that the lack of a van hove singularity in meg films implies that there is no interlayer coupling ( @xmath101).@xcite this conjecture oversimplifies the problem for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the coupling must be non - zero otherwise the films would simply delaminate in solution , which they do not .",
    "second , it is theoretically possible in tb to have a coupling and no van hove singularity .",
    "mele has recently shown that a certain class of rotation angles ( those with se - even rotations@xcite ) , while having a non - zero interaction , do not have a singularity at the supercell @xmath10-point.@xcite third , recent sts experiments on the fine structure splitting of the zero - landau level in meg films indicate that third layer interaction are consistent with tb interlayer coupling parameters.@xcite",
    "we have shown by directly measuring the band structure of multilayer epitaxial graphene that serious inconsistencies exist between the calculated and experimental band structure from commensurately rotated graphene sheets .",
    "both the predicted van hove singularity and the expected large reduction in the fermi velocity , as the commensurate rotation angle between graphene sheets goes to zero , are not observed , at least not at the dramatic level predicted or in the energy window specified by current theories .",
    "given that these theoretical predictions are broad - based , encompassing both tight - binding and _ ab intio _ calculations , the inconsistency between theory and experiment suggests a fundamental process that is not included in current theoretical treatments .",
    "it is possible that local strain fields caused by nearly overlapping @xmath94-bonds in the commensurate supercell lead to small relaxations that break some of the symmetry of the ideal rotated graphene pair . while such speculations are interesting , they lie outside the scope of this work",
    "nonetheless , the discrepancies pointed out this work suggest that a detailed look at these problems will be an important theoretical research avenue .",
