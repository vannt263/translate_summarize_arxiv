    "this mode is fitted particularly well .",
    "the fits for @xmath70 and @xmath34 are less satisfactory .",
    "the main reason is that the calculated minimum of @xmath80 is at 30 k like @xmath81 but experimentally the minima of @xmath70 and @xmath34 are at 40 k. in addition @xmath82 has little structure and is much smaller than @xmath80 .",
