    "the presence of the vortex core does not only introduce the gyrotropic mode , but also modifies the high - frequency spin wave normal mode spectrum @xcite by lifting the degeneracy of the azimuthal modes with opposite rotation sense @xcite .",
    "the out - of - plane component of the magnetization @xmath3 of these azimuthal spin waves can be described in polar coordinates @xmath4 as @xcite : @xmath5 these modes are characterised by a radial mode number @xmath6 ( positive integer values starting with 1 ) denoting the number of nodes of the radial part within the disk and an azimuthal mode number @xmath7 ( integer values ) , with @xmath8 being the number of nodes in the azimuthal part .",
    "the sign of @xmath7 denotes the rotation sense of the azimuthal wave ( ccw : @xmath7 positive , cw : @xmath7 negative ) .",
    "the symmetry in the frequency splitting of the azimuthal mode can be written as @xmath9 .",
    "a general concept of resonant vortex core reversal by rotating magnetic fields is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . on the left - hand side ,",
    "the gyrotropic mode ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) , is shown with a ccw sense of rotation for a core up state , and a cw sense of rotation for a core down state .",
    "the vortex core can only be reversed resonantly by applying an external rotating magnetic field if its frequency and sense of rotation correspond to the mode , as already shown experimentally in @xcite . on the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the frequency - split azimuthal modes are shown . for a vortex up",
    "this means that the mode with a cw sense of rotation , denoted by ( @xmath6 , @xmath12 ) , has a lower frequency and the mode with a ccw sense of rotation , denoted by ( @xmath6 , @xmath13 ) , has a higher frequency . for a vortex core down the sign of the azimuthal mode number @xmath7 , indicating the sense of rotation , is reversed for the higher and lower frequency modes compared to vortex core up , as sketched at the bottom part of fig .",
    "these spin wave modes with ( @xmath6 , @xmath14 ) can be selectively excited by the application of rotating in - plane magnetic fields with the corresponding frequency and rotation sense .",
    "thus at a fixed ghz frequency and core polarity the excitation is polarization selective in the same way as for the sub - ghz gyrotropic mode : only rotating fields with one rotation sense will pump the system .",
    "this suggests that a similar polarization selective switching mechanism for the vortex core may exist when any of the azimuthal spinwave modes are excited , albeit at much higher frequencies .",
    "we excited ferromagnetic permalloy discs , 1.6@xmath15 m in diameter , 50 nm thick , in the vortex magnetic ground state with bursts of ghz rotating magnetic fields of variable frequency and amplitude .",
    "the fields were applied with either a clockwise ( cw ) or counterclockwise ( ccw ) rotation sense @xcite .",
    "magnetic scanning soft x - ray microscopy at the maxymus endstation , helmholtz zentrum berlin , bessy ii was used to determine the out - of - plane magnetization of the vortex core .    the experimental verification of the concept as described before is presented in fig .  [ fig2 ] ( upper part ) .",
    "it shows the vortex core switching events from the initial vortex core up state to the down state as a function of excitation frequency , amplitude @xmath16 and sense of rotation of the external field . here",
    ", the burst length was fixed at 24 periods of the excitation frequency .",
    "three regions with a minimum in amplitude for vortex core reversal can be observed in the experimental data .",
    "dependent on the sense of rotation of the external magnetic field they are marked with blue or red backgrounds .",
    "the regions for cw excitation at about 4.5ghz and 6.5ghz , ccw excitation at about 5.5ghz can be assigned to the ( @xmath17 , @xmath12 ) , ( @xmath18 , @xmath12 ) and ( @xmath17 , @xmath19 ) spin wave modes , respectively ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .      in order to further investigate the core reversal at these different modes",
    ", we performed micromagnetic simulations @xcite for the same sample size and experimental conditions .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , lower part and are in good agreement with our experimental results .",
    "the small differences between the experimental and simulated results can be attributed to the uncertainty in the thickness , saturation magnetization and damping coefficient of the material , as well as to possible structural imperfections in the samples .",
    "the phases of a local fourier analysis @xcite of the dynamic magnetization let us clearly identify the azimuthal modes ( cf .",
    "[ fig2 ] , lower right part ) .",
    "the simulations with an extended frequency range up to 10.5ghz reveal even more spin wave eigenmodes capable of vortex core reversal : the ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) mode at about 9ghz and the two ( @xmath20 ) spin wave modes at about 10 and 10.3ghz .",
    "both the experiments and the micromagnetic simulations show that resonant switching of the vortex core from the down state back to the up state at the same frequency can be achieved only if the sense of rotation of the external field is reversed .",
    "this allows selective and unidirectional switching at each resonance frequency .    detailed analysis of the micromagnetic simulations reveal that the excitation of all spinwave modes also leads to the creation of a dip near the vortex core , resulting in the same core reversal mechanism as found for gyrotropic excitation @xcite .",
    "it is based on the creation and annihilation of a vortex - antivortex pair .",
    "but the dip creation itself differs dependent on which spin wave mode is excited .",
    "this dip creation for a vortex up ( @xmath21 ) is illustrated by snapshots of the simulations in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for the modes ( @xmath17 , @xmath22 ) . in the first frame ( 0 )",
    ", the unperturbed out - of - plane magnetization of the vortex can be seen .",
    "after a short time of excitation ( 135 phase angle ) the azimuthal spin wave with the same rotation sense as the external field develops .",
    "the interaction of the spin waves with the gyrotropic mode leads to a displacement of the vortex core towards the oppositely polarized region of the bipolar mode , resulting in a gyration with the same frequency as the external field ( 225 phase angle ) . at 405 ,",
    "a negatively polarized out - of - plane region can be observed next to the core , to the outside with respect to the centre .",
    "it is gyrating around the centre almost in phase with the vortex core .",
    "in the ( @xmath12 ) case ( upper panels ) , this region develops into a dip which finally leads to core reversal .",
    "but surprisingly , for the ( @xmath19 ) in the lower panels , there is an additional negatively polarized region .",
    "this region is situated towards the structure centre where the azimuthal mode has a positive polarization and gyrates with a phase shift of about 180 with respect to the vortex core . as can be seen from the last frame at 630 , it is this region which evolves into a fully out - of - plane dip , creating the vortex - antivortex pair for switching .",
    "the typical magnetization configurations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] including the higher radial mode numbers .",
    "the trajectories for the vortex core as well as for the dips and their relative phases are illustrated by arrows .",
    "the gyrofield , as used by guslienko _",
    "_ to describe the dip formation in the gyrotropic mode @xcite , can also be taken to explain the difference in dip formation for the ( @xmath19 ) and ( @xmath12 ) modes , as is sketched in fig .",
    "this effective field originates from the movement of the vortex and results in out - of - plane contributions to the left and right side of the core ( in respect to the direction of motion ) which are respectively negative and positive ( middle sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this velocity dependent behaviour breaks the symmetry between counter rotating vortices .",
    "if we now combine the spin wave amplitude with the effect of the gyrofield , we can understand the dip formation for any of the counter rotating modes ( right sketch in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) . for a vortex up and",
    "the mode ( @xmath12 ) with a cw vortex motion , the gyrofield acts constructively on the spin wave amplitude .",
    "for the ( @xmath19 ) mode , it acts destructively , causing the double dip configuration as seen in fig .",
    "alternatively , these dip structures can be regarded as a hybridisation between the gyrotropic mode and the azimuthal modes @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite also presented a dip formation mechanism for spin wave excitation under the condition of an artificially fixed vortex core .",
    "however , our results show that this condition can not be used to predict the reversal in free vortices , as in realistic structures . according to their analysis ,",
    "the polarization direction of the dip is given by the rotation sense of the external field only .",
    "this would mean that reversal of a given core polarization is only possible for one of the two azimuthal modes .",
    "e.g. the reversal at the ( @xmath19 ) as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] can not be explained with this assumption , as the dip polarization would be the same as the core polarization .",
    "the dynamic origin of the dip structure clearly explains this contradiction . for a free vortex ,",
    "the dip formation seems to be dominated by the gyrofield .",
    "vortex core reversal by the low - frequency gyromode excitation results in a typical gyration radius of about 300 nm for this kind of sample .",
    "in contrast , the gyration radius of the vortex core at ghz frequencies is only in the order of 10 nm ( cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "but due to the high - frequency rotation , this small radius still results in a very high velocity of the vortex core . the top part of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the velocities of the vortex core directly before the reversal process as calculated from the simulations .",
    "it varies between about 100 m / s ( @xmath12 ) and up to more than 600 m / s ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this demonstrates that for ghz spin wave excitation , no well - defined critical velocity is observed as it was calculated to be about 320 m / s for the gyromode of a permalloy nanodot @xcite .",
    "the reason can be found in our explanation of the dip formation as a combination of the gyrofield with the spin wave amplitude .",
    "although in first order , the gyrofield is proportional to the vortex velocity , the spin wave amplitude is not and thus the critical velocity before switching is higher or lower than the expected value , depending if their combination is constructive or destructive .",
    "similar arguments were used to explain the changes in critical velocity when perpendicular bias fields are applied @xcite .",
    "the large fluctuations in the velocities can be understood when the random contribution of short wavelength spin waves are also taken into account .",
    "consequently , the velocity itself is not a switching criterion for the spin wave mode induced vortex core reversal .    the bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows how long it takes for the vortex to switch after the burst is applied .",
    "it is no surprise that the larger the amplitude , the shorter the time for vortex core reversal .",
    "the minima in the excitation amplitude show a clear resonant behaviour . at high amplitudes",
    "the switching times become smaller than one period of the excitation and the frequency dependence is washed out , indicating the transition to non - resonant excitation @xcite .",
    "however , the feature of unidirectionality gets lost in the intersection of two oppositely rotating modes if too short bursts are applied .",
    "because both the vortex and the created vortex - antivortex pair remain close to the centre of the structure during the excitation , the relaxation after the spin wave induced reversal process is much faster than in the gyrotropic case , where it has to spiral back from its orbit far away to the centre . in combination with the very small gyration radius",
    ", this fast relaxation is accelerating the whole reversal process by up to two orders of magnitude , while the total energy pumped into the system is roughly the same compared to reversal at the gyrotropic mode .",
    "this fact makes this new reversal process very beneficial for fast technological applications .    in conclusion ,",
    "our experiments show vortex core reversal at ghz frequencies . by taking advantage of the vortex polarity dependent frequency splitting of the azimuthal modes ( @xmath6 , @xmath14 ) we present a concept for unidirectional reversal by exciting any of these modes up to 10 ghz .",
    "although the dynamics depend significantly on the different combinations of core polarity and azimuthal mode number , they can be explained by the superposition of the gyrofield with the spin wave amplitude .",
    "consequently , immediately before the switching event , different vortex core velocities are observed , which excludes the velocity as a critical condition for core reversal at ghz excitation .",
    "this finding highlights the importance of spin wave  vortex interaction and boosts vortex core reversal to much higher frequencies , which may offer new routes for spintronics applications .",
