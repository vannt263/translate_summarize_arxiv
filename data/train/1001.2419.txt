    "ever since the realization @xcite , shortly after the discovery of the heterotic string @xcite , that it provides a promising venue wherein the standard model may be embedded , string phenomenology was born .",
    "indeed , the @xmath0 gauge group of the heterotic string encompasses a natural gauge unification of the standard model @xmath1 group .",
    "a mathematically succinct and physically appealing approach was thereby engendered , where the @xmath0 string was compactified on a calabi - yau threefold @xmath2 .",
    "the tangent bundle @xmath3 of @xmath2 admits , by the calabi - yau nature , an @xmath4 connection and @xmath0 is thus broken to an @xmath5 gut group , the commutant of @xmath4 therein .",
    "this was the initial setup and the @xmath5 particle content is conveniently computed by the cohomology groups taking value in @xmath3 , which , by standard hodge decomposition of khler manifolds @xcite , are simply the hodge numbers of @xmath2 : @xmath6 now , the 27 of an @xmath5 gut theory contains the entirety of the standard model fermions , hence the net number of generations is simply ( the absolute value of ) the difference between the above two terms , which , by rudimentary topology , is half the euler number of @xmath2 .",
    "our desire , is that there be three net generations , in accord with experimental observations .",
    "therefore , one of the first questions in string phenomenology was whether there exists a calabi - yau threefold ( cy3 ) with euler number @xmath7 : @xmath8 homogeneous polynomials in @xmath9 . here , complete intersection means that the dimension of the ambient space exceeds the number @xmath10 of defining equations by precisely 3 , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , the calabi - yau condition of vanishing first chern class of @xmath3 translates to @xmath12 .",
    "subsequently , each manifold can be written as an @xmath13 configuration matrix ( to which we may sometimes adjoin the first column , designating the ambient product of projective spaces , for redundant clarity ) : @xmath14_{m \\times k \\ , } \\quad \\begin{array}{l } k = \\sum\\limits_{r=1}^m n_r-3 \\ , \\\\",
    "\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^k q^{r}_{j } = n_r + 1 \\ , \\ \\forall \\ ; r=1 , \\ldots , m \\ .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    the authors of @xcite proved that there can be only a finite number of such matrices and spent a number of years , in the nascent days of computer power , to establish a complete classification .",
    "the most famous example is , of course , the manifold @xmath15_{-200}^{1,101}$ ] ( or simply @xmath16 $ ] ) , known commonly as the * quintic*. we have marked the hodge numbers as superscript and euler number , subscript .    unfortunately , none of the 8000 or so cicys has euler number @xmath7 .",
    "nevertheless , it was soon realized by tian and yau that freely - acting quotients of these spaces could have the correct property and the manifold @xmath17 } / \\iz_3 $ ] has topological numbers @xmath18 .",
    "it was thus not surprising that this manifold became central to string phenomenology in the early days @xcite .",
    "nowadays , @xmath5 gut theories are less favoured than their @xmath19 or @xmath20 counterparts , which can then be broken to the ( minimally supersymmetric ) standard model ( mssm ) by turning on discrete wilson lines .",
    "furthermore , @xmath18 has 6 entire generations of anti - families , another cumbersome feature .",
    "modern heterotic phenomenology focuses on @xmath19 or @xmath20 guts and their subsequent breaking to the mssm .",
    "now , obtaining these gauge groups is relatively straight - forward : one simply recalls that their commutants in @xmath0 are , respectively , @xmath19 and @xmath21",
    ". therefore , endowing the cy3 @xmath2 with an @xmath22 bundle @xmath23 with @xmath24 will generalize the traditional setup where @xmath25 ( now known as `` standard embedding '' ) to give these gut theories ( now known as `` general embedding '' ) @xcite .",
    "the adjoint 248 of @xmath0 branches accordingly : @xmath26 the associated particle content is likewise captured by the various vector - bundle - valued cohomology groups : @xmath27 next , breaking the gut to the mssm gauge group is also elementary ( what is difficult , as we shall see , is obtaining the precise spectrum and couplings ) : one enriches the above structure of the pair @xmath28 with a discrete wilson line @xmath29 such that the commutant of @xmath29 in @xmath19 or @xmath20 is @xmath1 ( with a possibility of an extra @xmath30 factor ) . on a calabi - yau manifold with",
    "non - trivial ( discrete ) fundamental group @xmath31 , one can turn on a @xmath29-wilson line and compute the @xmath29-equivariant cohomology groups for @xmath23 , in conjunction with the action of the wilson line , to obtain the final particle spectrum .",
    "this has been developed in a programme led by ovrut , donagi , pantev et al.over the past decade : cf .",
    "@xcite ( q.v .  brief review in @xcite ) and @xcite .",
    "this search for the mssm , wherein the particle content is encaptured by bundle cohomology , the moduli , bundle endomorphisms , and yukawa couplings , trilinear compositions amongst the cohomology groups , has been a substantial challenge and a healthy dialogue for collaborative efforts between physicists and mathematicians .",
    "a preliminary success of the aforementioned endeavour culminated in 2005 where , sifting through some number of suitable vector bundles over so - called elliptically - fibered cy3s ( another large class of manifolds ) , two complementary heterotic mssm models with no exotic particles , no anti - generations , exactly one pair of higgs and reasonable yukawa couplings were found after years of search .",
    "one @xcite was based on an @xmath21 bundle coupled with a @xmath32 wilson - line , giving rise to , via an @xmath20 gut , the mssm with an @xmath33 , the other @xcite , on an @xmath19 bundle coupled with a @xmath34 wilson - line , giving the mssm via an @xmath19 gut .",
    "both models are based ( respectively by equivariant @xmath32 and @xmath34 actions ) on a parent self - mirror @xmath35 manifold , which is a @xmath36-fibration over a nineth del pezzo surface , which is itself an elliptic fibration over @xmath37 .",
    "remarkably , this @xmath35 covering manifold , from which both quotients descend , resides in the intersection between the database of elliptically fibered threefolds and cicys and it was an astute observation , initially made by candelas , that it is , in fact , intimately related to the cover of the tian - yau manifold : @xmath38 } \\",
    ", \\quad x_{-18}^{14,23 } = { \\left [ \\begin{matrix } 1&3&0\\\\ 1&0&3\\\\ \\end{matrix } \\right ] } \\ .\\ ] ] why indeed should the two most favoured manifolds from two completely different data - sets , spanning over a decade of search , be connected by so simple a transposition of configuration matrices ?",
    "the _ observatio curiosa _ prompted the investigations in @xcite wherein the two manifolds , together with the bi - cubic cicy , @xmath39}$ ] , as well as their various quotients were shown to be conifold transition of each other .",
    "the bundles thereon , were proposed to be linked by so - called * transgressions * , where a bundle on one is taken , being trivial on the conifold blowup @xmath37 cycles , to another bundle on the other after the conifold transition .",
    "indeed , all cicys are related by conifold transitions and it is a conjecture known as * reid s fantasy * that all cy3s are related by blow - up / down transitions generalizing the conifold ; it is thus natural to speculate that all ( stable ) vector bundles on all cy3s should transgress  perhaps the plethora of heterotic vacua are all inter - laced after all !    to have a glimpse of this multitude , a plot was made of all the known cy3s to date in @xcite , and in the spirit of @xcite as well as the pioneering work in mirror symmetry by candelas et al .",
    ", the ordinate and abscissa are taken , respectively , as the sum and the difference ( euler number ) of the two hodge numbers .",

    "there are about 500 million known calabi - yau manifolds , including the cicys , the elliptically fibered , isolated examples , etc . ; the largest family by far , however , is the impressive list compiled over the 1990 s , of smooth hypersurfaces in toric four - folds , performed in the lovely work of kreuzer - skarke @xcite , consisting of 473,800,776 inequivalent cy3s , with 30,108 distinct pairs of hodge numbers contributing to figure [ f : cyplot ] ( a ) .",
    "there are certainly many intriguing observations to be made on the plot , such as whether there can exist a cy3 whose euler number exceeds 960 in magnitude .",
    "more immediate to our concern , however , is that the centre of the plot has multiple occupation , that is , each point represents up to hundred of thousands of cy3s . nevertheless , as two decades of construction",
    "have taught us , in conjunction with subsequent work in @xcite , that the bottom corner of the plot is rather sparse . zooming into this *",
    "special corner * , presented in part ( b ) of the figure , shows rather pretty patterns .",
    "importantly , these low - hodge - number manifolds comprises of the few `` good '' examples on which bundles begetting exact mssm spectrum live and mutually transgress .",
    "is this corner an _ oasis _ in the seeming supererogation of string vacua , wherein a world like ours could blossom , while the remaining plenitude are no more than a swap - land @xcite ?",
    "short of a _ selection principle _ , an immediate method of approach to the special corner is not obvious , instead , a synthetic rather than analytic perspective may prove to be conducive .",
    "this has been undertaken over the past few years @xcite , where large classes of bundles are constructed over large data - sets of cy3s and then those with mssm properties , carefully selected .",
    "such a philosophy of algorithmic scan is indeed facilitated by the rapid advances in computational algebraic geometry as well as its implementation on ever - faster machines @xcite ; the cross - pollination of this subject with theoretical and mathematical physics has also recently been a healthy endeavour @xcite .",
    "we therefore wish to explicitly construct a large number of special unitary vector bundles @xmath23 on cy3s ; quite a few physical constraints can instantly be imposed .",
    "[ [ supersymmetry ] ] supersymmetry : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we are aiming for the mssm , and hence require @xmath42 susy in the low - energy 4-dimensional theory , which in turn implies that @xmath23 admits a holomorphic connection @xmath43 satisfying the hermitian - yang - mills ( hym ) equations : @xmath44 , a generalization of ricci - flatness for calabi - yau manifolds . solving these pdes",
    "explicitly are currently impossible .",
    "luckily , we are saved by the donaldson - uhlenbeck - yau theorem @xcite , which states that on each ( poly-)stable holomorphic vector bundle , there exits a unique hym connection .",
    "let us not delve into the details of stability , but only emphasize that this can be construed as a purely algebraic condition , without recourse to hard analysis .",
    "some immediate and calculationally important consequences are that the zeroth and highest cohomologies of a stable bundle @xmath23 vanish : @xmath45 ; this , coupled with * serre duality * for any bundle @xmath23 on a cy3 , that @xmath46 , imply the following @xcite : @xmath47    [ [ net - generations ] ] net generations : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the vanishing conditions , together with the atiyah - singer index theorem on @xmath2 which generalizes the statement for the euler number , yield that @xmath48 consequently , this gives us an expression for the net number of generations of particles , analogous to : @xmath49 we will require that this number be a multiple of three , say @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the order of a possible freely acting group @xmath52 on @xmath2 , so that upon descending to the quotient manifold @xmath53 , there would be precisely 3 generations .",
    "indeed , in order that @xmath52 be a free action , @xmath51 must necessarily ( but not sufficiently ) divide the euler number @xmath54 .",
    "[ [ anomaly - cancellation ] ] anomaly cancellation : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    to ensure green - schwarz anomaly cancelation @xcite , it is standard to set @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the ricci form on @xmath2 , that is , @xmath57 .",
    "however , one could allow m5-branes in the bulk , in a heterotic m - theory hoava - witten setup @xcite , which could wrap effective holomorphic 2-cycles ( i.e. , actual curves ) .",
    "hence , one could allow that the difference @xmath58 correspond to an effective class .",
    "finally , since we are dealing with su - bundles , @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in sum , we have constraints on all the three chern classes of @xmath23 .",
    "our strategy is clear . we will attempt to construct a large class of bundles satisfying the above constraints over a substantial data - set of cy3s .",
    "the most systematic method is the so - called * monad construction * over projective varieties @xcite , developed by algebraic geometers in the later half of the last century .",
    "in fact , all vector bundles over projective spaces can be so obtained , which is perhaps why such a leibnizian name , with regard to the universality implied , was originally chosen .",
    "it is thus not surprising that these bundles have been used sporadically but fruitfully in a physical context since the early days of string model building @xcite .",
    "the building block to a monad is a * line bundle * , the simplest vector bundle on any manifold .",
    "on cicys , a line bundle is easy to describe and so let us begin with this historical data - set @xcite",
    ". denote @xmath60 , as is standard , the @xmath51-th power of the hyperplane bundle @xmath61 over @xmath62 , then its first chern class is @xmath63 with @xmath64 being the khler class of @xmath62 .",
    "subsequently , one could restrict this to any projective variety @xmath2 to obtain @xmath65 with the proviso that @xmath2 also has only a single khler class , as descended from the ambient @xmath62 .",
    "such cases of when @xmath66 of the ambient and variety itself are both unity is called * cyclic*.    in general , our ambient space @xmath67 for cicys are products of @xmath68 projective spaces in which @xmath10 homogeneous polynomials define @xmath2 .",
    "we shall call the cases where @xmath69 as * favourable * ; here the khler classes descend completely from @xmath67 to @xmath2 . in this case",
    "we can write line bundles over @xmath70 as @xmath71 with corresponding restriction to the cicy , @xmath2 .",
    "finally , we have the kodaira vanishing theorem @xcite which states that for a positive line bundle @xmath72 on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath2 , @xmath73 for all @xmath74 . for cicys ,",
    "a positive line bundle is one for which each @xmath75 entry above is positive .",
    "this vanishing will be of significant aid to us in computing the spectrum and couplings later .",
    "therefore , our starting point will be monads constructed from positive line bundles over favourable cicys .    thus prepared , we can define a monad as the bundle @xmath23 which resides in a short exact sequence ( i.e. , a free resolution of length 2 ) : @xmath76 here , short exactness implies that @xmath77 and that @xmath78 .",
    "the map @xmath79 is explicitly a matrix of polynomials ; e.g. , on @xmath80 the @xmath81-th entry is a homogeneous polynomial of degree @xmath82 .",
    "moreover , our positivity requirement implies that all integers @xmath83 be strictly positive .    in summary , the physical constraints in ",
    "[ s : cons ] manifest themselves as a list of combinatorial conditions on the integers @xmath83 :    1 .",
    "bundle - ness : @xmath84 for all @xmath85 and the map @xmath79 can be taken to be _ generic _ so long as exactness of the sequence is ensured ; 2 .",
    "su - bundle : @xmath86 ; 3 .",
    "anomaly cancellation : @xmath87 ; 4 .",
    "three generations : @xmath88 , with @xmath51 a divisor of @xmath54  .    upon finding such monads , we shall then prove stability and compute the particle spectrum and yukawa couplings .",
    "these are extremely technical and difficult problems and have been a major hindrance to existing literature if one were to calculate them for large classes on the order of thousands or more .",
    "a break - through in the method of attack of the programme in @xcite is the extensive use of the recent rapid advances in computer algebra , especially in algorithmic algebraic geometry @xcite .",
    "we shall not dwell too much in this review on these technicalities and shall only mention that for stability , at least for cyclic manifolds , a so - called hoppe s criterion reduces the problem to computing cohomology groups .",
    "to arrive at the various cohomologies , the standard approach here is to use spectral sequence induced from the koszul resolution of @xmath23 , whereby simplifying the problem to known cohomologies ( via bott - borel - weil and knneth @xcite ) on the ambient product of projective spaces .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that positive bundles satisfying the above list of constraints is finite in number , amounting to about 7000 on only a small number of cicys .",
    "we present the statistics thereof below and the histograms of @xmath89 , i.e. , the number of generations , in figure  [ f : pos ] :        [ cols= \" < \" , ]      + rank 3 & 5680 & 3091 & 458 & 19 + rank 4 & 1334 & 207 & 96 & 2 + rank 5 & 104 & 52 & 5 & 0 + total & 7118 & 3350 & 559 & 21 +    \\(a ) , of the 7118 positive monads found over 36 favourable cicys : the horizontal axis is @xmath90 and the vertical , the number of bundles ; ( b ) the same data set , but only taking into account monads with @xmath91 for some positive integer @xmath51 , such that @xmath51 divides the euler number of the corresponding cicy . , title=\"fig:\",width=211 ] ( b ) , of the 7118 positive monads found over 36 favourable cicys : the horizontal axis is @xmath90 and the vertical , the number of bundles ; ( b ) the same data set , but only taking into account monads with @xmath91 for some positive integer @xmath51 , such that @xmath51 divides the euler number of the corresponding cicy . , title=\"fig:\",width=211 ]      emboldened by our ability to classify and further intrigued by the rarity of occurrence of anything akin to the mssm , we enlarged our data - set to include the so - called semi - positives ; these are monads with possible zeros in the entries .",
    "currently , short of strong isomorphism theorems we do not have a finiteness result even though the numbers are expected to be so ; preliminary scans have produced a substantially larger set . on these bundles",
    "an initial scan was performed and single one was so far found @xcite to have the exact mssm spectrum .",
    "interestingly , the base manifold turned out to be the bi - cubic , @xmath92 @xmath93{c}\\mathbb{p}^2\\\\\\mathbb{p}^2\\end{array}\\left|\\begin{array}[c]{ccc}3 \\\\3 \\end{array}\\right .   \\right]^{2,83}_{-162}$ ] , again one of the guises of the tian - yau manifold !",
    "specifically , this new heterotic standard model , to be added to the other two within the special corner , has no anti - generations , no exotic particles , one pair of mssm higgs and an @xmath33 .",
    "it is obtained from an @xmath21 monad bundle @xmath94 giving first an @xmath20 gut , which is subsequently broken by a @xmath32 wilson line to give the desired @xmath95 group . in order to turn on this wilson line",
    "we ensured that there exists a freely acting @xmath32-group , which was found in @xcite , giving a quotient manifold @xmath96 . to guarantee that the bundle @xmath23 also descends to the quotient",
    ", it was further shown that admits an equivariant structure with respect to the group action , and hence the quotient is also a bona fide bundle .",
    "armed with the advances in contemporary algebraic geometry , encouraged by the possibility of extensively utilizing computer algebra coupled with physical intuition and insight in order to sift through vast data - sets , and spurred by the observation and speculation of transgressions within a special corner in the space of stringy vacua , our spirits are enheartened by optimism .",
    "for the first time , the prospects of an systematic and thorough expedition of the heterotic landscape , a venture dreamt of for two decades , seem within our grasp .",
    "we have explored the oldest geography of the cicys , and already found a rare occurrence of the mssm ; meanwhile , reconnaissance into the further territory of the elliptic manifolds and most importantly the toric hypersurfaces are well under way @xcite .",
    "the glimpse into a barren expanse of a _ terra incognita _",
    ", harbouring perhaps a rare treasure cove bejewelled by universes close to our own , enlivens our souls .",
    "onwards we must march .",
