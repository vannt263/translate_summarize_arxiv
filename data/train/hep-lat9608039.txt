    "the presence of renormalon singularities in the pole mass , @xmath16 , implies that the intuitive definition @xmath17 does not correspond to a physical quantity .",
    "thus , if @xmath0 is to be used in phenomenological applications , a definition free of renormalon ambiguities has to be given .",
    "one can define the b  meson binding energy from the experimentally measured value of some physical quantity , for example the inclusive @xmath18 lepton spectrum .",
    "it is important to notice that such a definition , although correct , depends on the order of the perturbation series that determines the theoretical prediction for the experimental quantity .",
    "lattice simulations of the hqet provide the opportunity to compute @xmath0 non  perturbatively by using the definition of @xmath0 proposed in ref.@xcite which is free of renormalon ambiguities . on the lattice ,",
    "renormalons are absent but matrix elements of lattice operators may contain power ultraviolet divergences . consider the two  point correlation function @xmath19 for large values of @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 creates a b  meson from the vacuum .",
    "it is tempting to define @xmath23 .",
    "however , the `` bare '' binding energy @xmath24 can not be a physical quantity because it diverges linearly as @xmath25 , @xmath26 being the lattice spacing @xcite . the origin of the linear divergence is the mixing of the operator @xmath27 with the lower dimensional operator @xmath28 .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the linear divergence must be subtrated non  perturbatively in order not to reintroduce renormalon ambiguities .",
    "this divergence can be eliminated from any correlation function by defining a renormalized action @xmath29 of the form @xcite |hd^r_4 h = |h d_4 h - ( 1-(-a|m ) ) |hh where @xmath30 is a mass counter ",
    "term which can be chosen in many different ways .",
    "our preferred definition of @xmath30 is @xcite [ eq : defdm ] -|m_t ( ) where @xmath31 is the heavy ",
    "quark propagator in the landau gauge which can be computed in a numerical simulation of the hqet .",
    "in words , ( [ eq : defdm ] ) is the condition that the subtracted heavy ",
    "quark propagator has no exponential fall at large times or equivalently that @xmath32 .",
    "due to confinement effects , it is not clear that ( [ eq : defdm ] ) has a finite limit as @xmath33 .",
    "our numerical results obtained from three independent high  statistics simulations at @xmath34 and @xmath15 support our assumption on the infrared bahaviour of the heavy ",
    "quark propagator : no confining effects are visible up to distances of about @xmath35 fm , which is the largest distance which we can reach @xcite .",
    "an alternative definition of @xmath36 which does not require any assumption about the large time behaviour of the heavy quark propagator is given in refs.@xcite .",
    "however , with this definition @xmath0 is not a parameter of @xmath37 .",
    "notice also that the divergent part of @xmath30 must be gauge invariant .",
    "moreover , the gauge dependence of possible finite parts is eliminated from physical quantities up to the order of perturbation theory at which the calculation is performed .",
    "the renormalized binding energy @xmath0 which is of order @xmath37 , free of renormalon singularities and independent of the renormalization scale is defined as : @xmath38 .",
    "our best estimate of @xmath0 is @xmath39 mev ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "we can also compute the @xmath2 running mass of the b ",
    "quark , @xmath3 . by comparing the heavy ",
    "quark propagator in the continuum with the one on the lattice , we obtain @xcite _ b(_b)= ( m_b - ) _",
    "m(_s , |m ) where @xmath40 is the qcd  hqet matching constant ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "taking @xmath41 gev , we find @xmath42 gev @xcite , where the first error is statistical and the second is an estimation of the error in the truncation at @xmath43 of the perturbative factor @xmath40 , derived from the bubble ",
    "resummation approximation @xcite .",
    "this error can be reduced to about @xmath44 mev by computing perturbative corrections at two  loop order .",
    "this calculation requires the evaluation of the heavy quark propagator in the continuum , already done , and on the lattice at @xmath45 .",
    "the langevin approach of ref.@xcite can be used to perform the computation on the lattice .",
    "like @xmath0 , @xmath1 has no physical meaning since it depends on the definition that one decides to adopt for the kinetic operator . on the lattice ,",
    "matrix elements of this operator contain linear and quadratic divergences @xcite .",
    "the finite kinetic operator , which is free of power divergences , has the form |h_r^2 h = |h^2 h - |h d^r_4 h - |h h where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are subtraction constants which we define by imposing the `` physical '' non  perturbative renormalization prescription @xcite h(=0)|h^2_r hh(=0 ) = 0 in the landau gauge .",
    "this is equivalent to the condition @xmath48 where [ rhorat ] _",
    "^2(t ) with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . to determine @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we fit @xmath51 for large @xmath20 to a straight line .",
    "our numerical results show that the infrared limit of the ratio in eq.([rhorat ] ) does indeed exist , in spite of the confinement effects in the heavy  quark propagator .",
    "@xmath47 can also be obtained directly by eliminating the sum over @xmath52 in eq.([rhorat ] ) and searching for a plateau in @xmath20 and @xmath52 .",
    "we find that , after subtracting the contribution of contact terms , both methods give indistinguishable results ( see ref.@xcite for details ) . notice also that , for the same reason as for @xmath36 , @xmath47 must be gauge independent .",
    "the renormalized kinetic energy @xmath1 is then given by : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 is a gauge invariant matching constant known up to one loop order @xcite .",
    "a convenient way to extract @xmath56 is to study the large time behaviour of the ratio of the two  point and the three ",
    "point , with an insertion of the kinetic operator , b ",
    "meson correlation functions .",
    "the significant reduction of the statistical errors with respect to our previous study allows for a much better identification of the plateau region , which could not be really observed in ref.@xcite .",
    "we find @xmath57 gev@xmath58 and for the physical parameter @xmath59 gev@xmath58 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) . in order to make a meaningful comparison of our results with other theoretical determinations , a perturbative calculation of the relation between the different definitions of @xmath1 , and also of @xmath0 ,",
    "is needed at a sufficient degree of accuracy @xcite .",
    "this calculation is missing to date .",
    "the chromo  magnetic operator that enters in the calculation of @xmath6 is only logarithmically divergent in the ultraviolet cut  off so that there is no need of a non  perturbative subtraction .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 has a physical meaning because it corresponds directly to the measurable @xmath4@xmath5 mass splitting up to higher power corrections in @xmath60 m_b^*^2 - m_b^2 = 4 _ 2 = 4 z _ _",
    "2^bare where @xmath61 is the renormalization constant necessary to remove the logarithmic divergence present in the bare operator .",
    "the procedure to extract @xmath62 is the same as for @xmath63 ( see ref.@xcite for details ) .",
    "we find @xmath64 gev@xmath58 corresponding to a mass splitting which is about one half of the experimental value . in our opinion , there are three possible explanations of the discrepancy , which is common to all lattice results .",
    "the first is the fact that , at one loop order , @xmath61 is very large indicating that higher  order terms may modify this factor significantly .",
    "a second source of systematic error is quenching .",
    "the final possibility is that the discrepancy is due to the fact that the mass splitting receives significant contributions from higher terms in the hqet .",
    "further investigation is needed on this subject .",
    "we have also computed the parameter @xmath65 , which enters the theoretical prediction of the @xmath7@xmath8 mixing parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "we measure @xmath10 and @xmath9 from the ratios of three and two  point functions with the @xmath68 operator fixed at the origin . due to the high statistics we have accumulated",
    ", we can study this ratios at large time distances at which the ground state has been unambiguosly isolated .",
    "we find a very good signal for all the correlation functions and ratios .",
    "however , the main uncertainty in our results comes from the evaluation of the renormalization factors relating the effective operators on the lattice to those in the continuum . for @xmath9",
    ", we use the new calculation of the nlo wilson coefficients of the @xmath43 full theory  hqet matching , which takes into account previously missed contributions @xcite . in our opinion ,",
    "a non  perturbative computation of these factors is crucial to reduce the rather big systematic errors .",
    "this work is in progress now @xcite .",
    "our best estimates are @xcite : @xmath69 ( rgi b parameter ) , @xmath70 and @xmath71 , where we use the boosted perturbation theory to evaluate the renormalization constants .",
