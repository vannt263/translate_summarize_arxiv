    "an important object in the study of @xmath2 is its _ minimal free resolution _ , which encodes essentially all information about @xmath2 .",
    "for example , the betti numbers of @xmath2 can be read off as the ranks of the modules in its minimal resolution .",
    "there are computationally intensive algorithms to compute the minimal resolution of an arbitrary ideal ( for example , in macaulay 2 @xcite , the command ` res i ` returns the minimal resolution of @xmath3 ) , but no general description is known , even for monomial ideals .",
    "thus , it is an ongoing problem of considerable interest to find classes of ideals whose minimal resolutions can be described easily .",
    "a related problem is to describe non - minimal resolutions which apply to large classes of monomial ideals .",
    "the most general answer to the latter question is taylor s resolution , a ( usually highly non - minimal ) resolution which resolves an arbitrary monomial ideal ; it is discussed in section [ s : taylor ] .",
    "a very successful approach to both problems in the last decade has been to find combinatorial or topological objects whose structures encode resolutions in some way .",
    "this approach began with _",
    "simplicial resolutions _ @xcite , and has expanded to involve polytopal complexes @xcite , cellular complexes @xcite , cw complexes @xcite , lattices @xcite , posets @xcite , matroids @xcite , and discrete morse theory @xcite .",
    "resolutions associated to combinatorial objects have distinguished bases , and relationships between the objects lead to relationships between these bases in a very natural way .",
    "it thus becomes possible to compare and combine resolutions in all the ways that we can compare or combine combinatorial structures .",
    "for example , most of these resolutions turn out to be subcomplexes of the taylor resolution in a very natural way .",
    "the only new result in the paper is theorem [ thethm ] , which describes the intersection of all the simplicial resolutions of an ideal .    in section 2",
    ", we describe some background material and introduce notation used throughout the paper .",
    "section 3 introduces the taylor resolution in a way intended to motivate simplicial resolutions , which are introduced in section 4 .",
    "section 5 describes the scarf complex , a simplicial complex which often supports the minimal resolution of a monomial ideal , and otherwise does not support any resolution .",
    "section 6 defines the family of lyubeznik resolutions .",
    "this section is essentially a special case of an excellent paper of novik @xcite , which describes a more general class of resolutions based on so - called `` rooting maps '' .",
    "section 7 uses the lyubeznik resolutions to prove theorem [ thethm ] , that the scarf complex of an ideal is equal to the intersection of all its simplicial resolutions .",

    "we expect that in fact @xmath155 is a vertex of @xmath34 , but this need not be the case : for example , if @xmath156 , we could have @xmath157 .",

    "the corresponding simplicial complexes are pictured in figure [ lyubstd ] .",
    ".,width=288 ]    it is unclear how to choose a total ordering on the generators of @xmath2 which produces a smaller lyubeznik resolution .",
    "example [ lyubex2 ] suggests that the obvious choice of a term order is a bad one : the lex and graded ( reverse ) lex orderings all yield the taylor resolution , while the minimal resolution arises from orderings which can not be term orders .    we still need to show that , unlike the scarf complex , the lyubeznik resolution is actually a resolution .",
    "the lyubeznik resolutions of @xmath2 are resolutions .",
    "let @xmath169 be the generators of @xmath2 and fix an order @xmath147 on @xmath30 .",
    "for each multidegree @xmath110 , we need to show that the simplicial subcomplex @xmath170 , consisting of the rooted faces with multidegree dividing @xmath110 , has no homology .    if @xmath171 , this is the empty complex .",
    "if @xmath172 , we claim that @xmath170 is a cone .",
    "suppose without loss of generality that @xmath173 .",
    "we claim that , if @xmath34 is a face of @xmath170 , then @xmath174 is a face as well .",
    "first , note that @xmath175 divides @xmath110 because both @xmath176 and @xmath97 do .",
    "thus it suffices to show that @xmath174 is rooted .",

    "if @xmath35 , then @xmath158 because @xmath34 is rooted , and @xmath178 . thus @xmath174 is rooted .",
    "hence @xmath170 is a simplicial cone on @xmath176 and is contractible .",
    "the only new result of this paper is that the scarf complex of an ideal @xmath2 is the intersection of all its minimal resolutions . to make this statement precise",
    ", we need to refer to some ambient space that contains all the minimal resolutions ; the natural choice is the taylor resolution .",
    "[ thethm ] let @xmath2 be a monomial ideal .",
    "let @xmath179 be the intersection of all isomorphic embeddings of the minimal resolution of @xmath2 in its taylor resolution .",

    "we showed in theorem [ scarfinside ] that the scarf complex is contained in this intersection .",
    "it suffices to show that the intersection of all minimal resolutions lies inside the scarf complex .",
    "we will show that in fact the intersection of all the lyubeznik resolutions is the scarf complex .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 is a face of every lyubeznik simplicial complex .",
    "this means that , regardless of the ordering of the monomial generators of @xmath2 , the first generator dividing @xmath97 appears in @xmath34 .",
    "equivalently , every generator which divides @xmath97 appears as a vertex of @xmath34 .",
    "thus , @xmath34 is the complete simplex on the vertices with multidegree dividing @xmath97 .",
    "now suppose that there exists another face @xmath36 with the same multidegree as @xmath34 .",
    "every vertex of @xmath36 divides @xmath181 , so in particular @xmath35 . but",
    "this means that @xmath36 is also a face of every lyubeznik simplicial complex , so every generator dividing @xmath182 is a vertex of @xmath36 by the above argument . in particular , @xmath183 .",
    "this proves that @xmath34 is the unique face with multidegree @xmath97 , i.e. , @xmath34 is in the scarf complex .",
    "the viewpoint that allows us to consider the statement of theorem [ thethm ] requires that we consider a resolution together with its basis , so resolutions which are isomorphic as algebraic chain complexes can still be viewed as different objects .",
    "the common use of the phrase `` _ _ the _ _ minimal resolution '' ( instead of `` _ _ a _ _ minimal resolution '' ) suggests that this this point of view is relatively new , or at any rate has not been deemed significant . in any event , there are some natural questions which would not make sense from a more traditional point of view .",
    "all the interesting resolutions i understand are subcomplexes of the taylor complex in a very natural way : their basis elements can be expressed with relative ease as linear combinations of taylor symbols . if a resolution is a subcomplex of the taylor resolution , then it is simplicial if and only if all its basis elements are taylor symbols . for a simplicial resolution to fail to be a subcomplex of the taylor complex",
    ", the set of vertices of its underlying simplicial complex must not be a subset of the generators - in other words , the underlying presentation must not be minimal .",
    "my suspicion is that such resolutions may exist , at least for special classes of ideals , and may be useful in the study of homological invariants such as regularity which are interested in the degree , rather than the number , of generators ."
