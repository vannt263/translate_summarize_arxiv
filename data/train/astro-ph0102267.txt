    "photometric studies of open clusters are extremely useful to determine the physical properties of star members .",
    "even though modern spectroscopic techniques allow the observation of large numbers of stars in a relatively short time , the stellar population of most clusters is still too vast for an in - depth study . among photometric systems ,",
    "the @xmath11h@xmath12 system is the most appropriate for the study of early - type stars , since it has been designed to provide accurate measurements of their intrinsic properties .",
    "this is the first in a series of papers dedicated to the study of the b - star population of galactic open clusters .",
    "b - type stars are sufficiently bright to allow very accurate narrow - band photometry and at the same time numerous enough to provide a statistically significant population ( unlike the brighter but very rare o - type star ) ."

    "<S> we present @xmath0 ccd photometry of the central region of the double cluster @xmath1 & @xmath2 persei . </S>",
    "<S> we identify @xmath3 350 stars , of which 214 were not included in oosterhof s catalogue . </S>",
    "<S> our magnitude limit @xmath4 allows us to reach early f spectral type and obtain very accurate fits to the zams . </S>",
    "<S> we derive reddening values of @xmath5 for @xmath1 persei and @xmath6 for @xmath2 persei . from the zams </S>",
    "<S> fitting , we derive distance moduli @xmath7 and @xmath8 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 persei respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values are perfectly compatible with both clusters being placed at the same distance and having identical reddenings . </S>",
    "<S> the shift in the main - sequence turnoff and isochrone fitting , however , show that there is a significant age difference between both clusters , with the bulk of stars in @xmath1 persei being older than @xmath2 persei . </S>",
    "<S> there is , however , a significant population of stars in @xmath1 persei which are younger than @xmath2 persei . </S>",
    "<S> all this argues for at least three different epochs of star formation , corresponding approximately to @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>"
