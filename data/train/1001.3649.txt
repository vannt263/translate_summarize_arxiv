    "the gravitational theory of general relativity presents as a remarkable feature the property of ( active ) diffeomorphism gauge invariance .",
    "the einstein - hilbert action@xmath3 is symmetric under the `` diff '' transformation @xmath4 , which represents the active version of the infinitesimal coordinate transformation @xmath0 .",
    "when attempting to quantize this theory in a perturbative expansion , one can take the ansatz @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a classical background that fulfills the classical equations of motion ( e.o.m ) , and @xmath7 is the quantum perturbation . in this way , one gets@xmath8\\label{eq:}\\ ] ] where the quadratic part in @xmath7 constitutes the free - theory . in the case of a flat space , with a minkowski classical background ,",
    "the free - theory is given by the fierz - pauli lagrangian:@xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "note that we have allowed for field redefinitions @xmath14 with respect to the usual presentation of the fierz - pauli lagrangian , when @xmath15 .",
    "the corresponding action is symmetric under the `` linear diff '' transformation@xmath16 and represents the action for a free massless spin - two particle ( graviton ) . here",
    ", gauge invariance is essential to eliminate the unphysical propagating modes , much like in electromagnetism , where the bad - behaved longitudinal mode is made a gauge artifact through the symmetry @xmath17 .",
    "the authors of @xcite undertook the task of finding out the most general conditions for a consistent description of the free massless spin - two particle .",
    "this involved considerations regarding the little group iso(2 ) of the masless spin - two particle and the necessity of triviality of the generators of translations .",
    "their conclusion is that , actually , one only needs the somehow smaller gauge symmetry@xmath18 which we will denote as the `` linear tdiff '' transformation , to indicate the transverse condition on the vector parameter .",
    "hence , one can think of alternative theories of gravity to general relativity , based on a slightly different symmetry principle , which however contain the graviton in the linear regime as well . from this observation , there are basically two ways to proceed forward .",
    "the first route was already explored in the aforementioned seminal paper @xcite .",
    "one should note that the transversality condition in is directly affecting the transformation rule of the trace of @xmath7 : @xmath19 , such that this quantity is an invariant .",
    "therefore , one can decide to restrict the value of the trace in the theory to have a fixed value , tipically @xmath20 . in the full non - linear regime",
    ", this naturally translates into the condition @xmath21 .",
    "this approach has been named _",
    "unimodular gravity .",
    "_    in this work we are concerned with the second way to proceed .",
    "one can ask himself about the most general theory involving an unconstrained second - rank tensor @xmath7 and which is compatible with the tdiff symmetry .",
    "since we will be using less symmetry than the standard diff case , we expect to get a _ more general _ action also in the full non - linear regime:@xmath22=s_{diff}[g_{\\mu\\nu},\\psi]+s'[g_{\\mu\\nu}(x),\\psi].\\label{eq:}\\ ] ] we wondered whether this fact could be useful in addressing such problems as the dark energy of dark matter puzzles .",
    "the concrete answer in the linear regime was found in @xcite . in general , one gets an extra scalar - like mode propagating as well as the two tensor modes corresponding to the massless graviton  the only exception is when the tdiff symmetry is enhanced with an additional weyl conformal symmetry , in which case the unimodular approach is recovered . specifically:@xmath23 where the form of the different pieces in the lagrangian is given below .",
    "it should be stressed that this tdiff langrangian , as well as the following ones , are not covariant with respect to general coordinate transformations , so that one has to formulate them in a specific set of coordinates .",
    "this is the reason why we are not talking of a _ proper _ additional scalar mode .    in the non - linear regime ,",
    "the symmetry _ naturally _ generalizes is restricted with @xmath24 ( and @xmath25 ) is doomed since one can not accommodate a kinetic term for @xmath2 : @xmath26 . ]",
    "to@xmath27 @xmath28 hence , the determinant of the metric acts as a scalar under this restricted transformation ( it is not , however , a scalar under coordinate transformations ) .",
    "what this entails is that one can have arbitrary powers of @xmath2 appearing everywhere in the action of the full tdiff theory:@xmath29,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] formulated in a specific set of coordinates .",
    "the first question that was examined was the ultraviolet behaviour of these theories .",
    "less symmetry translates in this case into more divergences , as compared with the template of general relativity .",
    "specifically , a calculation employing the background field method was undertaken in order to extract the 1-loop order divergences @xcite .",
    "we made use of a correspondence between tdiff theories and scalar - tensor theories in the so - called `` unitary gauge '' , which helped simplify the computations .",
    "to 1-loop order , general relativity is uv ( on - shell ) finite @xcite .",
    "these theories are not , due to extra terms arising from the additional @xmath2-mode ; in fact , the result is very similar to a scalar - tensor theory with the scalar replaced by @xmath2 .",
    "the only exceptions are two already - mentioned limiting cases : general relativity and the presence of an additional conformal weyl symmetry ( unimodular case ) .",
    "then , the observational signatures of these kind of theories were inspected @xcite .",
    "a general remark is that an almost exact correspondence can be found between these theories and scalar - tensor theories where the @xmath2 is promoted to a true scalar field @xmath30 , and a lagrangian multiplier is added to the action to force the constraint @xmath31 ( the precise form of this correspondence remains to be stablished [ in preparation ] ) . in practice , we can thus apply all existing experimental bounds on scalar - tensor gravity to constrain these theories .",
    "one should note that , in general , the presence of @xmath2 `` alone '' in the matter action will translate into a _",
    "non - metric coupling _ of the scalar @xmath30 , when viewed in terms of the scalar - tensor language ; hence , we will get wild violations of the ( weak ) equivalence principle . a mechanism in the spirit of the metric postulate @xcite , or",
    "the one usually advocated in string theory @xcite will be generically necessary to render the theory compatible with observations .",
    "* tdiff theories are well motivated alternative theories of gravity from a quantum perspective . * to the 1-loop level , these theories present uv divergences  while general relativity is uv finite  , with only one significant exception that corresponds , arguably , to unimodular gravity . *",
    "the experimental bounds on scalar - tensor theories of gravity are generically applicable to these theories .",
    "a mechanism to avoid `` excessive '' violations of the ( weak ) equivalence principle is thus necessary to render the theory compatible with experiments ."
