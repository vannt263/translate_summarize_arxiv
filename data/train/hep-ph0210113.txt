    "the recent evidence for neutrino oscillations  @xcite opens a new and exciting era in neutrino physics .",
    "we now know that neutrinos of one flavor can transform themselves into neutrinos of a different flavor .",
    "the atmospheric and solar  neutrino results from the super - kamiokande ( super - k ) and sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) experiments suggest that all three known flavors participate in neutrino oscillations . within the framework of three - flavor mixing ,",
    "the oscillation probabilities are determined by three mixing angles ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) , one complex phase ( @xmath2 ) , and two mass splittings ( @xmath3m@xmath4 and @xmath3m@xmath5 where @xmath3m@xmath6 m@xmath7 - m@xmath8 , the difference between the squares of the masses of the neutrino mass eigenstates ) .",
    "the super - k and sno data suggest that ( i ) @xmath9m@xmath10  ev@xmath11 , ( ii ) sin@xmath12 , and if the lma msw solution is confirmed , ( iii ) @xmath3m@xmath13",
    "ev@xmath11 , and ( iv ) sin@xmath14 .",
    "in addition , the chooz reactor @xmath15 disappearance search result implies ( v ) sin@xmath16 .",
    "however , there is a lot we do nt know :    * does three - flavor mixing provide the right framework , or are there also contributions from additional sterile neutrinos , neutrino decay , cpt - violation ... ? * is sin@xmath17 small , tiny , or zero ? * is @xmath2 non - zero ?",
    "is there cp - violation in the lepton sector , and does it contribute significantly to baryogenesis via leptogenesis ? * what is the sign of @xmath3m@xmath4 ( which determines the neutrino mass hierarchy ) ?",
    "* is sin@xmath18 maximal (= 1 ) ?    the answers to these questions may lead us towards an understanding of the origin of flavor .",
    "however , getting the answers will require the right tools , and a neutrino factory  @xcite appears to be the tool that we will ultimately require .",
    "in a neutrino factory muons are stored in a ring with long straight sections .",
    "muon decays generate a neutrino beam downstream of each straight section .",
    "if @xmath19 are stored @xmath20 decays generate a beam consisting of 50% @xmath15 and 50% @xmath21 . if @xmath22 are stored the beam consists of 50% @xmath23 and 50% @xmath24 .",
    "design studies  @xcite suggest that neutrino factories can provide o(10@xmath25 ) useful muon decays per year .",
    "since the kinematics of muon decay is well known , we expect minimal systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux and spectrum .",
    "hence , compared to conventional neutrino beams made using a @xmath26 decay channel , neutrino factories provide @xmath15 and @xmath27 beams in addition to @xmath23 and @xmath21 beams , with small systematic uncertainties on the beam flux and spectrum .      at a high performance 20  gev neutrino factory providing @xmath28 useful",
    "muon decays / yr the @xmath23 beam flux is about an order of magnitude larger than the anticipated future numi beam flux at fermilab",
    ". eventually superbeams ( very high intensity conventional neutrino beams driven by mw - scale primary proton beams ) may also be able to achieve beam fluxes that are about a factor of 10 greater than the numi flux .",
    "however , with higher energy neutrino factories the event rate at a distant detector increases like @xmath29 , rapidly exceeding any corresponding rate we can imagine at a superbeam .",
    "this is not the whole story .",
    "the beam energy distributions are also different .",
    "the neutrino factory beam has a sharp cut - off at the energy of the stored muons . in a conventional neutrino beam",
    "there is an annoying high - energy tail which gives rise to backgrounds from neutral current ( nc ) events in which a leading @xmath30 is misinterpreted as an electron , faking a @xmath31 signal .",
    "this background source is absent at a neutrino factory .",
    "although the @xmath23 beam properties are interesting , the main reason for wanting a neutrino factory is that it would also provide @xmath15 and @xmath27 beams , enabling very sensitive searches for @xmath32 oscillations .",
    "the resulting @xmath23 component can interact in the far detector via the charged current ( cc ) interaction to produce a muon with a charge of opposite sign to that of the muons stored in the neutrino factory .",
    "the experimental signature is therefore the appearance of a wrong - sign muon , for which backgrounds are expected to be at the @xmath33 level or lower .",
    "in contrast to this , the equivalent @xmath31 oscillation search using a superbeam suffers from background levels that are at about the @xmath34 level . to compare signal and background rates it is useful to consider some explicit examples  @xcite corresponding to entry - level and high - performance neutrino facilities :    * entry - level superbeam ( jhf @xmath35 super - k ) . running period = 5 years , detector mass = 22.5  kt , proton beam power = 0.75  mw . * high - performance superbeam ( super - jhf @xmath35 hyper - k ) .",
    "running period = 8 years , detector mass = 1000  kt , proton beam power = 4  mw . * entry - level neutrino factory ( nufact i ) : @xmath36 useful muon decays / year at 50 gev",
    ". running period = 5 years , detector mass = 100  kt .",
    "* high - performance neutrino factory ( nufact ii ) : @xmath37 useful muon decays / year at 50 gev .",
    "running period = 8 years , detector mass = 100  kt .",
    "for these four examples , the signal and background rates are compared in table  1 .",
    "based on the signal to background ( s / b ) ratios we might expect that the sensitivity at a neutrino factory will ultimately be about two orders of magnitude better than at a high - performance superbeam .",
    "more detailed studies  @xcite suggest that this naive conclusion is not far from the truth although the full story is much more complicated .",
    "@lcccc & jhf - sk&jhf - hk&nufact i&nufact ii + signal & 140&13000&1500&65000 + background & 23 & 2200 & 4.2 & 180 + s / b & 6 & 6 & 360 & 360 +",
    "neutrino factory data can be separated into 6 subsamples with events tagged by the appearance of ( i ) a right - sign muon , ( ii ) a wrong - sign muon , ( iii ) an @xmath38 or @xmath39 , ( iv ) a @xmath40 , ( v ) a @xmath41 , or ( vi ) the absence of a lepton .",
    "measurements can be made with @xmath19 and then with @xmath22 stored in the ring .",
    "hence there are 12 event energy distributions that can be simultaneously fit to obtain the oscillation parameters .",
    "since neutrino factories provide intense high energy beams , oscillation baselines can be long , or very long ( thousands of km ) . with multiple experiments",
    ", measurements can be checked with a wide range of baselines .",
    "recent studies have suggested that this wealth of information will be necessary to pin down the oscillation parameters and provide sufficient redundancy to ensure we have the right oscillation framework .    to better understand this it is instructive to expand the expressions for the oscillation probabilities in terms of small quantities , keeping just the leading order terms .",
    "we already know that @xmath42 is small .",
    "we can construct a second small quantity @xmath43 .",
    "defining @xmath44 , to leading order in @xmath42 and @xmath45 , the oscillation probabilities in vacuum are given by : @xmath46 where the @xmath47 sign in the expression for @xmath48 corresponds to neutrino / antineutrino oscillations . examining the leading order oscillation expressions we note that :    \\i )",
    "we can replace @xmath49 with @xmath50 without changing @xmath48 since vacuum oscillations do not depend upon the sign of @xmath3 . for sufficiently long ( neutrino factory ) baselines within the earth this degeneracy is broken by matter effects .",
    "\\ii ) for non - maximal mixing we can replace @xmath51 with @xmath52 and compensate the change in the predicted oscillation probabilities by changing @xmath53 .",
    "\\iii ) we expect a strong correlation between the fitted values for @xmath2 and @xmath42 . in many cases the best fit combination @xmath54",
    "is accompanied by another pair @xmath55 that yields the same predicted leading order oscillation probabilities .",
    "hence , we can expect strong correlations between the values of the oscillation parameters extracted from fits to the data .",
    "in addition we can expect degenerate solutions ( alternative regions in parameter space that are consistent with the data ) . to understand the physics capabilities of neutrino factories ( or superbeams )",
    "we must take into account the impact of these correlations and degeneracies .",
    "consider first the smallest value of @xmath42 that will yield a @xmath56 signal .",
    "we will begin by ignoring effects of the all important correlations and degeneracies .",
    "the value of @xmath42 that will yield a significant appearance signal is shown as a function of @xmath57 in fig .  1 for the jhf @xmath35 super - k superbeam and for neutrino factories with energies between 20  gev and 50  gev .",
    "superbeams can probe values of @xmath42 an order of magnitude below the present limit .",
    "if @xmath57 is very small , so that the sub - leading scale does not contribute to the appearance signal , a high - performance neutrino factory would improve on the superbeam sensitivity by more than another order of magnitude .",
    "if @xmath57 is in the upper half of the presently allowed region ( spanned by the figure ) then neutrino factory experiments will measure an appearance signal even if @xmath58 , enabling oscillations generated by the sub - leading scale to be directly measured .",
    "we must now consider the impact of correlations and degeneracies .",
    "the calculated @xmath42 sensitivities ( 90% cl ) from ref .",
    "@xcite are shown in fig .  2 for the superbeam and neutrino factory scenarios listed in section  2.2 .",
    "the leftmost end of the bars indicate the sensitivities in the absence of correlations , degeneracies , and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the impact of each of these effects on the sensitivity is indicated by the shaded sub - bars .",
    "systematic uncertainties degrade the sensitivity by a modest amount . with a baseline of 3000  km",
    ", the impact of correlations and degeneracies limits the high - performance neutrino factory @xmath42 sensitivity to o(@xmath59 ) .",
    "we can fight correlations and degeneracies by using a longer baseline , or multiple baselines .",
    "in fact with a baseline of @xmath60  km the sensitivity is expected to have improved to a few @xmath61 ( fig .",
    "3 ) .      if present , cp violation ( cpv ) and matter effects will modify the measured @xmath62 oscillation probabilities .",
    "these modifications are different for neutrinos and antineutrinos .",
    "the predicted ratio of events @xmath63 at a neutrino factory experiment with equal @xmath19 and @xmath22 running is shown as a function of baseline in fig .  4 .",
    "with no cpv and no matter effects (",
    "l = 0 ) the ratio is 0.5 , reflecting the different neutrino and antineutrino cross - sections .",
    "as l increases the ratio is enhanced ( suppressed ) by matter effects if the sign of @xmath64 is negative ( positive ) . at",
    "sufficiently long baselines the matter effects are much larger than effects due to possible cpv ( indicated by the bands in the figure ) .",
    "the sign of @xmath64 and the cp phase @xmath2 can therefore be determined by precise measurements of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "however , in this simple picture we have fixed the values of @xmath67 , @xmath57 , and @xmath42 . if we now allow all of these parameters to vary in our fit to the data we must deal will the resulting correlations and ambiguities .",
    "the impact of these complications on the sensitivities of neutrino factory and superbeam experiments can be seen in fig .  5 , which shows the minimum values of @xmath42 for which the sign of @xmath64 , and hence the neutrino mass hierarchy , can be determined .",
    "with a single experiment at one baseline , correlations and degeneracies can degrade the expected sensitivities by orders of magnitude .",
    "it is believed that at a high - performance neutrino factory , with two experiments having very different baselines , the sign can probably be determined provided @xmath42 exceeds o(@xmath33 ) or perhaps a few @xmath61 .",
    "further study is needed to understand this better , and to understand how the picture is improved by combining superbeam and neutrino factory measurements .",
    "the sensitivity to cpv has also been studied and found to be very dependent on @xmath57 .",
    "if @xmath68  ev@xmath11 , in the center of the presently favored lma parameter space , maximal cpv would be observed at a high performance neutrino factory if @xmath42 exceeds a few @xmath69 . in the next few years kamland",
    "is expected to improve our knowledge of @xmath57 , allowing us to sharpen our understanding of the cpv capabilities of superbeams and neutrino factories .",
    "if the lsnd oscillation result is confirmed , the simple three - flavor mixing framework will need to be modified to include , for example , additional light neutrinos that are sterile and/or cpt violation .",
    "we will already have some knowledge of @xmath56 and @xmath70 oscillations .",
    "it seems likely that there will be a premium on searching for and measuring @xmath71 oscillations , a program unique to neutrino factories .",
    "it has been shown  @xcite that there are viable regions of four - neutrino mixing parameter space in which both cpv and thousands of @xmath71 events could be seen at a neutrino factory delivering only o(@xmath72 ) decays / yr .",
    "hence , if the lsnd result is confirmed , a very low intensity neutrino factory might provide a well motivated first ( fast and cheap ? ) step towards the high - performance facility we will ultimately want .",
    "finally , we must not forget the extensive non - oscillation physics program at a neutrino factory facility .",
    "a high - performance 50  gev neutrino factory can provide @xmath73   neutrino events per kg per year , enabling highly instrumented detectors to obtain data samples of unprecedented magnitude .",
    "experiments that might benefit from these intense beams include ( i ) precise neutrino cross - section measurements , ( ii ) structure function measurements ( with no nuclear corrections ) , in which individual quark - flavor parton distributions can be extracted , ( iii ) precise @xmath74 measurements from non - singlet structure functions , ( iv ) studies of nuclear effects ( e.g. shadowing ) separately for valence and sea quarks , ( v ) spin structure functions , ( vi ) tagged single charm meson and baryon production ( a 1 ton detector could yield @xmath75 flavor - tagged charm hadrons / yr ) , ( vii ) electroweak tests ( @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) , ( viii ) exotic interaction searches , ( ix ) neutral heavy lepton searches , and ( x ) searches for anomalous neutrino interactions in em fields .",
    "this is only a representative list , to which would be added the possible physics programs that exploit very intense cold muon beams and the very intense primary proton beams that would also be available at a neutrino factory complex .",
    "neutrino factories seem to offer a way to probe @xmath78 and determine the sign of @xmath64 provided @xmath78 exceeds a few @xmath61 .",
    "neutrino factories would also enable @xmath71 oscillation searches .",
    "no other candidate future facility has these capabilities .",
    "should the lma solar neutrino solution be confirmed , sensitive cpv searches would also be possible .",
    "this would either extend the reach that would already have been obtained at superbeams , or possibly follow up an initial indication of cpv with a precise measurement of the phase @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , an extensive non - oscillation physics program would enable neutrino factories to serve a broad community .",
    "our understanding of the physics capabilities of neutrino factories is based on the work of many groups over several years .",
