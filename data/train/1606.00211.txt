    "the potentials appearing in the schrdinger equation as considered in undergraduate courses are traditionally expected to have two basic didactic properties : first , they should illustrate relevant physics ( energy quantization , tunneling , features of the steady states , etc . )  of real quantum systems ; and second , the schrdinger equation should have analytical or semi - analytical solutions that , hopefully , can be worked out by the students .",
    "unfortunately , the second condition severely reduces the set of suitable potentials , which hampers our ability to illustrate quantum phenomena .",
    "it has been long recognized that this difficulty can be eased if numerical methods for solving the schrdinger equation are also employed.@xcite there are several numerical techniques that , while not excessively specialized , can deal with this equation .",
    "most popular , perhaps , are finite - difference methods , which are easy to understand and employ in their simplest version.@xcite these methods clearly show how the requirement of physically acceptable bound solutions leads to energy quantization.@xcite recently , marsiglio _ et al .",
    "_  have described a quite different numerical procedure in which the schrdinger equation and its solutions are written in matrix and vector form , respectively , in the basis of the infinite square - well eigenfunctions .",
    "these authors have obtained approximate solutions for the schrdinger equation in one dimension ( harmonic potential , finite square well,@xcite and a set of periodic potentials@xcite ) and for the radial equation for three - dimensional potentials with spherical symmetry ( coulomb , yukawa , and finite spherical well potentials).@xcite    the matrix approach has some nice features .",
    "first , it helps students understand vector spaces and the matrix representation of quantum operators . typically , in undergraduate courses",
    "the matrix representation of quantum operators appears when discussing angular momentum ( pauli matrices , clebsch - gordan coefficients ) and degenerate perturbation theory,@xcite but its connection to the previously well - studied schrdinger formalism is unclear .",
    "the approach of refs .",
    "provides a simple way to relate the two formalisms .",
    "it is especially fortunate that , in this approach , the solutions are expanded in the basis of the infinite square - well eigenfunctions because this is just a fourier expansion , a topic many students are familiar with .",
    "finally , this approach leads to a numerical method that is quite simple to use , accurate , valid for a large number of potentials ( essentially , all potentials @xmath0 for which the integral of @xmath0 times the product of sinusoidal functions can be evaluated ) , and can be easily programmed , especially with modern software packages such as mathematica , providing in many cases excellent results with quite modest computational cost .",
    "( as supplementary materials we include in ref .   the mathematica codes employed to solve the systems and examples considered in this paper .",
    ")    another nice feature of the matrix approach is that it provides at once numerical estimates of the first @xmath1 energies and eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation , where @xmath1 can be set at will .",
    "compare this with the standard finite - difference approach , where energies and eigenfunctions are obtained one by one.@xcite this property makes the matrix method especially suitable for the study of periodic potentials where many energies are involved in the formation of energy bands .",
    "besides , in some cases these energies are so close that some of them , and their corresponding eigenfunctions , can be easily missed by standard finite - difference methods .",
    "the matrix approach is free of this problem .    in this paper",
    "we exploit these characteristics of marsiglio s matrix approach to the study of periodic potentials , with the kronig - penney ( kp ) model as archetype.@xcite this model is commonly used in courses in solid - state physics to justify qualitatively the appearance of energy bands . there",
    "exist several procedures to solve the schrdinger equation with such a potential.@xcite these procedures use the original approach of kronig and penney s paper , which starts from wave functions compatible with the bloch theorem .",
    "this means that they require some knowledge about solid - state physics , which most undergraduates have not reached when they study quantum physics .",
    "the method that we present here , on the contrary , does not require any background in solid - state physics ; the energy bands arise naturally from the formalism .",
    "thus , this method can ease the difficulties that students face when they extend their knowledge about quantum physics to crystalline solids .    in sec .",
    "[ secmatrixmet ] we present the matrix formalism and point out its convenience for dealing with periodic potentials when a sufficiently large number of unit cells ( periods ) are considered . in sec .",

    ". the usefulness of this method to provide the time evolution of quantum systems is illustrated with an example involving the kp solid under an external field .",
    "we note here that there are two especially useful complementary references to the present paper .",
    "one is ref .  , in which the original kp model , the kp solid under an external field , and some other interesting variations of the kp model ( doped lattices and amorphous lattices ) are studied numerically using a finite - difference method .",
    "the other is ref .  , where marsiglio s approach is used to obtain numerical solutions within a single unit cell , which are then extended by means of bloch s theorem to periodic potentials .",

    "the eigenfunctions of @xmath2 are @xmath7 and the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath8 with @xmath9 .",

    "this approximation is valid , for example , when the eigenfunctions @xmath17 of @xmath10 are negligible outside the box.@xcite however , in this paper we will use this procedure to study periodic potentials , a case where the above condition does not hold . specifically , we will replace the infinitely repeating potential @xmath0 with a finite periodic potential @xmath16 encompassing just a few periods inside the region @xmath13 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "although the wave functions of the ( fully ) periodic @xmath10 are not at all negligible outside the box , our rationale here is that the effects of the box boundaries on some quantities ( e.g. , the allowed energies ) will be negligible if the number of periods inside the box is large enough .",

    "the value of @xmath1 is chosen to obtain some predefined accuracy . in practice ,",
    "for example , one starts with a trial value of @xmath1 and then increases this value until the effect of the increase on the energy eigenvalues is less than some desired threshold .    in summary , the numerical matrix method of refs .",
    "consists of ( 1 ) embedding the potential within an infinite square well ; ( 2 ) expanding the wave function in the basis of eigenstates of the infinite square well , retaining only the first @xmath1 terms of the expansion , with @xmath1 chosen self - consistently ; and ( 3 ) solving the eigensystem , truncated at dimension  @xmath1 , to obtain the low - lying energies and the associated wave functions .",

    "<S> a numerical matrix methodology is applied to quantum problems with periodic potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure consists essentially in replacing the true potential by an alternative one , restricted by an infinite square well , and in expressing the wave functions as finite superpositions of eigenfunctions of the infinite well . </S>",
    "<S> a matrix eigenvalue equation then yields the energy levels of the periodic potential within an acceptable accuracy . </S>",
    "<S> the methodology has been successfully used to deal with problems based on the well - known kronig - penney ( kp ) model . </S>",
    "<S> besides the original model , these problems are a dimerized kp solid , a kp solid containing a surface , and a kp solid under an external field . a short list of additional problems that can be solved with this procedure is presented . </S>"
