    "the technical ability of producing nanosized materials lead among other achievements to the discovery - and nowadays the technological application  @xcite - of semiconductor ( sc ) qds . in these structures",
    "some typical features of sc bulk material are prevailed  @xcite and married to typical atomic properties  @xcite emerging from the energy level quantization  @xcite in the qds , motivating their name : artificial atoms .",
    "@xcite dqds can either be coupled ( artificial molecules  @xcite ) or uncoupled .",
    "the latter arrangement we consider here for the investigation of an energy transfer process between qds .",
    "the electron confinement achieved through different qd geometries ( disc shaped , spherical , wires , double layered , etc . )",
    "presents an interesting variety of electronic properties that are , however , similar for various kinds of qds .",
    "epitaxially - grown self - assembled qds are most commonly disc or pyramidally shaped ingaas islands onto a gaas substrate fed through a wetting layer by free electrons from the substrate .",
    "@xcite vertical stacking of layers allows to obtain a nanostructure of vertically arranged dqds .",
    "@xcite    in electrostatically defined qds , a two - dimensional electron gas is created between two semiconductors with different gaps .",
    "the gas can carry free electrons which can be further confined using charged metallic gates to define the regions of one , two or more qds .",
    "@xcite in the last years the advances in nanowire fabrication allowed the construction of qds inside long nanowires using interlaced layer of different semiconductors .",
    "@xcite colloidal nanocrystals can nowadays be constructed small enough to observe quantization of the electronic levels .",
    "they have attracted a lot of attention in the past few years as materials in modern third generation solar cells .",
    "@xcite in all theses qd structures the manipulation of the electronic levels of the qds is straightforward . particularly , manipulation of levels with different spin quantum numbers by magnetic or electric fields is possible .",
    "this allows the study and characterization of transitions between them ,  @xcite which are an appealing and desirable property in the field of quantum information .",
    "many experimental techniques are employed in current research to measure the properties of qds .",
    "the electrical current through qds can be obtained by transport spectroscopy .",
    "transport on electrostatically defined qds ,  @xcite nanowire based qd structures ,  @xcite and nanotube defined qds  @xcite is widely used to determine the level structure inside the qds .",
    "another important field of research in various nanostructures is carrier relaxation dynamics within excitons after an optical excitation .",
    "pump - probe schemes with time resolution in the order of ten of picoseconds can resolve processes such as electron - phonon interactions ,  @xcite multiple exciton generation ,  @xcite auger relaxation  @xcite also far - ir relaxation and relaxation into defects , impurities especially at surfaces .",
    "the characteristics can be measured by photoluminescence spectroscopy  @xcite and complementary photocurrent measurements can give information on the non - radiative decay time and energy of the excitons or intra - conduction band excited states .",
    "@xcite in the specific case of dqds , the transitions and tunneling dynamics of electrons of vertically coupled qds were studied  @xcite and interdot phonon - relaxation processes were detected between the qds .",
    "p to s orbital electron relaxation via electron correlation has also been demonstrated in uncoupled @xmath0-doped dqds  @xcite and after electric pulse excitation .",
    "@xcite in this case the relaxation in one qd occurs via energy transfer and emission of an electron in a neighboring qd in a process called intermolecular coulombic decay ( icd ) .",
    "@xcite    in the present work we focus on the less intensively studied capture dynamics of free electrons into n - doped dqds mediated solely by long - range electron correlation .",
    "@xcite in general the most important electron capture mechanism is via emission of longitudinal optical phonons , that has been studied before in single  @xcite and double qds .",
    "@xcite it has been analyzed theoretically in single qds along with electron collisions and emission .",
    "@xcite in our previous work  @xcite we showed for the first time that electron capture can as well be mediated efficiently by long - range electron correlation in the interatomic coulombic electron capture ( icec ) in dqds .",
    "the process was named after the one originally predicted to be operative in atoms and molecules .",
    "@xcite in atoms the electron capture by one atom occurs while another electron is emitted from an atom into its environment . in dqds",
    "the electron capture by one qd leads to an emission of electrons from neighboring qds with controlled energy properties that can be tuned by changing the geometric dqd parameters .",
    "@xcite we postulated icec for n - doped dqds embedded in nanowires ( fig .",
    "[ types_of_nanowires ] ) using an effective mass approximation ( ema )  @xcite based model potential in which we performed numerically exact electron dynamics calculations .",
    "the relaxation dynamics of an excitonic electron in undoped materials can be described within the same model provided that the hole relaxation to the band edge has been faster than that of the electron .",
    "@xcite    we showed already that the probability for icec is non - negligible  @xcite and can be greatly enhanced in the presence of two - electron resonance states that are capable of undergoing fast icd - related energy transfer . here , we systematically add other dqd configurations to those studied before and analyze how and for which energies in the different configurations icec in the general and the resonance case becomes most effective .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : first we present some general considerations on the icec process  ( [ general ] ) , introduce our model and the dqd electronic structure  ( [ model ] ) followed by the electron dynamics methods used  ( [ methods ] ) and the results  ( [ results ] ) . since numerically exact computations in the full six - dimensional hilbert space are very time consuming , we additionally include an effective two - dimensional description of the nanowires and compare to the full dimensional results ( [ 1dicec ] ) .",
    "the discussion of the results using realistic semiconductor parameters are given in  ( [ discussion ] ) followed by the conclusions  ( [ conclusion ] ) .",
    "in this work we consider a system of two fully correlated electrons and two qds which we call the left and right qd and which are described by two different model potentials ( see fig .  [ scheme ] ) . for the time",
    "being consider a left potential well that supports only a single one - electron level @xmath1 with energy @xmath2 and a right one with one single - electron level @xmath3 with energy @xmath4 such that @xmath5 .",
    "the tunneling and hybridization between @xmath1 and @xmath3 in the dqd is vanishingly small due to the long interdot distance @xmath6 of the considered system .",
    "the icec process occurs as depicted in fig .",
    "[ scheme ] where an electron is initially bound to the right qd and another electron with momentum @xmath7 is coming in from the left side of the dqd .",
    "the incoming electron can then be captured into the @xmath1 ground state of the left qd while the electron on the right is emitted from the @xmath3 ground state of the right qd .",
    "energy conservation dictates that the total energy of the system @xmath8 @xmath9    is conserved  @xcite and the kinetic energy acquired by the outgoing electron can be expressed as @xmath10    with the corresponding momentum @xmath11    where @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the electron effective mass in atomic units . as one can notice from eq .",
    "( [ final_momentum ] ) the emitted electron can have a higher or a lower momentum than the initial electron , depending on the relation between the bound - state energies @xmath4 and @xmath2 .",
    "however , for negative values of @xmath15 the icec channel is closed if the incoming electron energy is lower than @xmath16 ( see eq .",
    "( [ final_momentum ] ) ) .",
    "note also that since @xmath17 is the energy acquired by the outgoing electron , then @xmath18 is conversely the energy gain / loss suffered by the dqd .",

    "( a ) a 3d confinement is obtained using a layered semiconductor structure , in ( b ) the nanowire is built of a single semiconductor material and the barriers are obtained by electrostatic depletion ( areas indicated with green shading ) .",

    "the effective mass approximation is used to describe the quantum dots as two potential wells .",
    "the capture of the incoming electron by the left dot ( dashed green state ) is mediated by its correlation with the electron initially bound to the right dot ( full green state ) . while the electron is captured in the left dot , the electron on the right is excited into the continuum and becomes an outgoing electron.,scaledwidth=49.0% ]",
    "the motion of two electrons inside a nanostructured semiconductor can be accurately described using a few - electron effective mass model potential  @xcite in which electron dynamics calculations are feasible .",
    "this approach offers then straightforward observability of how electron correlation can lead to icec in general two - site systems where electron correlation between moieties plays a fundamental role as well as in the specific case of a qd .",
    "we adopt here the model for the dqd used previously to study the dynamics of icec  @xcite and icd .",
    "@xcite the dots are represented by two gaussian wells aligned in @xmath19 direction . in @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "direction we assume a strong harmonic confinement which could be attributed either to depleting gates  @xcite or to the actual structure of the semiconductor .",
    "@xcite besides the full three - dimensional calculations we also considered a simpler one - dimensional model that uses an effective electron - electron interaction to take the wire shape of the system in @xmath20 and @xmath21 direction implicitly into account . in this one - dimensional effective model electron dynamics calculations are much more efficient because only the @xmath19 coordinates of the electrons are evolved in time .",
    "the two - electron effective mass hamiltonian for the system is @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the relative dielectric permittivity and @xmath24    is a one - electron hamiltonian in which @xmath25    are the transversal confinement and longitudinal open potentials , respectively .",

    "the electronic coordinates one can obtain the scaling relationships of the hamiltonian parameters shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : h_par ] .",
    "clearly , we can use the effective mass and the relative permittivity equal to one and rescale the parameters afterwards to obtain the energies and distances for a specific semiconductor .",
    ".scaling of the hamiltonian and parameters under the transformation @xmath28 . [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : real_par_c ]    for the setup c case ( c ) the time window shown in fig .",
    "[ surface_plots_c ] is of @xmath29 a.u . and",
    "transforming it to the semiconductor materials of table  [ tab : real_par_b ] we obtain @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ps .",
    "we can in this setup estimate the duration of the emission using the lifetime of the involved resonance @xmath34 .",
    "we have that for case ( c ) @xmath35 a.u . which gives the following times in real semiconductors @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ps . from the observed values of the gaas energy spacings and electron energies in the range of @xmath40  mev",
    ", the decay of the l@xmath41r@xmath42 resonance in icec seems to be competitive with relaxation via phonons .",
    "the times for icec are , however , faster than reported intraband decay times due to acoustic phonon emission for ingaas / gaas qds of @xmath43 ps .",
    "@xcite    our work is focused on strongly laterally confined structures , such as nanowires , and is thus suitable for the use of a one - dimensional effective potential . in all cases and setups",
    "treated here both the full and one - dimensional descriptions provided almost identical qualitative and quantitative results .",
    "the main result obtained from this comparison for the cases studied in this work is that the physics in the strongly laterally confined model can be correctly described using the effective potential when the characteristic lateral energies are about twice or more than those of the qds .",
    "ultrafast electron capture in single qds is an extensively studied topic nowadays  @xcite due to its relevance in the development of a wide variety of technological applications .",
    "@xcite as shown here , electron capture via the icec processes , in which the neighboring qd in a dqd is getting ionized , is particularly fast and can play a significant role in the dynamics contributing to the energy transfer between qds .",
    "the icec mechanisms in dqds could , in principle , be exploited to be implemented in devices which generate a nearly monochromatic low energy electron in a given direction .",
    "the implementation of dqds in nanowires using materials with long carrier lifetimes such as inp  @xcite should be favorable for icec .",
    "the rate at which the electron capture occurs varies with material and radius of the wire . reported times for carrier trapping cover a large range from fast values of @xmath44 ps for gaas  @xcite and @xmath45 ps for zno  @xcite to very slow ones such as @xmath46 ns for inp nanowires .",
    "@xcite using wires with long carrier trapping times are favorable for icec to be active .",
    "the process is driven by long - range coulomb interactions , so we expect icec to be also applicable to other qds geometries like , _",
    "e.g. _ , self - assembled vertically stacked dots .",
    "@xcite    we have derived an effective one - dimensional approach that correctly describes the dynamics and rps of all the cases we have considered .",
    "this approach reduces considerably the computational efforts and also demonstrates , by comparison with full 3d computations , that the physics involved is described correctly by a one - dimensional model as long as the characteristic confinement energy is about twice or more than that of the qd .",
    "the calculations presented were performed for the same distance @xmath6 between the dots . since long - range correlation",
    "is involved in icec a rather pertinent question is how the reaction probability changes with @xmath6 .",
    "the answer has been partially given in the first publications on icec in atoms and molecules ( see ref .  ) and for the related icd decay ( see refs .   and  ) .",
    "the icec cross section has an asymptotic @xmath47 decay with the distance , according to previous theoretical estimates for atoms and molecules . however , there are important contributions not considered in the asymptotic formulas leading to @xmath47 which are due to orbital overlap ( see , ref .   for icd in qds and ref .   for molecules ) .",
    "these contributions can lead in some cases to a much faster icd process .",
    "furthermore , the quasi - one dimensional geometry of the dots considered here has a clear influence on icd ( ref .  ) and probably also on icec .",
    "the calculations are rather cumbersome and at the moment there is no exhaustive analysis of this kind for icec , but it will be done in the future .",
