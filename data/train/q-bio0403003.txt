    "@xcite for references ) . ever since the early years , one of the subjects where the use of nonlinear models has been more productive is the modelling of dna physics @xcite . indeed",
    ", the first paper on this issue dates back to 1980 , when englander and coworkers published a report entitled `` nature of the open state in long polynucleotide double helices : possibility of soliton excitations '' @xcite .",
    "subsequently , a large number of researchers contributed to this field , which has by now reached maturity ; the reader is referred to ref .",

    "were carried out from a more thermodynamical or statistical mechanics viewpoint , focusing , e.g. , on the characterization of the thermal denaturation transition ( the phase transition that takes place at temperatures around 70@xmath0 c when the two strands of the dna molecule separate ) .",
    "however , the recent theoretical advances in nonlinear theory , related to self - localization in nonlinear networks , @xcite along with the capability to carry out experiments on single molecules ( to be discussed below ) achieved in the last few years @xcite have impulsed a shift on the emphasis of the modelling to the dynamics of single molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "the decoding of the genome has also led to new questions , and , in particular , to the necessity for a better understanding the relationship between sequence , physical properties , and biological function .    in this work , we aim to contributing a step in the above described direction by revisiting the englander model .",
    "our main goal is to include in the system the effects of the sequence heterogeneity in order to assess whether the model contains the necessary ingredients to reproduce the behavior of real dna molecules .",
    "in addition , we want to keep in mind that actual experiments ( or biological functioning ) will unavoidable take place in the presence of noise ( at least from thermal origin ) and therefore another of our objectives here will be to verify the robustness of the observations in the model when noise is considered . in the following sections , we review the previous research on which our work is based , then present our results for the deterministic case , to close finally with the report on the stochastic model .",

    "the glass bead is then pulled at constant velocity , opening or unzipping the double chain by consecutively breaking the hydrogen bonds of the base pairs , and the force used to pull it is recorded .",
    "the first experiments along this line were carried out in 1997 by essevaz - roulet and cowokers @xcite and largely improved in accuracy in 2002 @xcite .",
    "other experiments have been carried out ; the interested reader may find a review by bustamante , leader of one of the most important groups in the field , in @xcite .",
    "the use of a model as ours is in fact very appropriate since an analysis of the experimental results shows that such an experiment can not distinguish individual base pairs ; instead , it observes the breaking of groups of a few tens of base pairs , which is correctly represented by the displacement of one kink @xcite . in this context , the force @xmath7 in eq .",
    "( [ 2 ] ) represents the action of the pulling on the end of one strand on the region where unzipping is taking place .",
    "we will see in the conclusion that our model indeed reproduces qualitatively the experiments .      following the pioneering report of ref .",
    "@xcite , an important extension and application was proposed and studied by salerno @xcite .",
    "he was the first one to consider the effects of the sequence by studying spontaneously travelling kinks in t7a@xmath16 promoter ( a region of the genome preceding a gene where the transcription activity starts ) of the bacteriophage t7 .",
    "salerno studied further other regions of the bacteriophage @xcite , finding that the dynamical activity of kinks should be very special in the promoters .",
    "recently , the problem was revisited in ref .",
    "@xcite following the sequencing of the whole genome of the bacteriophage t7 .",
    "the main conclusion of this work was that there indeed is a significantly higher degree of activity in promoter regions , even in the presence of noise .",
    "the results of the simulations reported in refs .",
    "@xcite were analyzed theoretically by salerno and kivshar @xcite , who , using a collective coordinate approach ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for a review on collective coordinate techniques for soliton - bearing equations ) , developed a description of the kink dynamics in terms of an effective potential .",
    "we will not review in detail the procedure to obtain this effective potential but , instead , we will simply outline the main steps .",
    "the idea is to consider the undamped model , which can be derived from the hamiltonian @xmath17=\\sum_{n=1}^n\\{\\frac{1}{2}\\dot{u}_n^2 + \\frac{1}{2a^2}[u_{n+1}-u_n]^2 + v_n(1-\\cos u_n)+fu_n\\}.\\ ] ] we now insert the following _ ansatz _ @xmath18\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the average value of @xmath5 over the chain , in the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath20 which is formally equivalent to the energy of a particle subjected to the action of the effective potential @xmath5 .",
    "the exact formula for this potential is quite cumbersome and we do not need to reproduce it here .",
    "we refer the reader interested in the details of the calculation and the full result to refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in this situation , in 1995 , when the genome was not yet available , f.  domnguez - adame and coworkers @xcite propose to mimic the behavior of dna heteropolymers of biological relevance by replacing the sequence dependent values @xmath5 by an aperiodic , but fully deterministic sequence . as examples",

    "the results obtained in that work ( subsequently confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite ) pointed out the existence of an intriguing phenomenon , namely the existence of a threshold force for a kink to start moving along the chain .",
    "once the force is above the threshold , the kink moves with an asymptotically constant given by the balance of damping and driving .",
    "an analytical expression can be easily derived to predict the asymptotic velocity from energy conservation arguments ( see ref .",
    "although the original argument is valid for a homogeneous chain , repeating it here with the average value @xmath19 leads to a prediction which is very accurate for periodically ordered chains while overestimating ( by approximately a 10% ) the velocity for the fibonacci chains .",

    "points correspond to numerical results , numbers indicate the fibonacci generation constituting the unit cell of the chain .",
    "reprinted from ref .",
    "@xcite ; see the original paper for more details .",
    ", height=264 ]    even more interestingly , it was also found ( see fig .  [ fig : fibo ] ) that the threshold value depended on the length of the quasiperiodic chain considered .",
    "this was seen by forming periodic chains with unit cell @xmath24 , @xmath24 being the fibonacci chain in iteration @xmath2 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fibo ] , increasing the size of the unit cell leads to an increasing of the threshold , reaching a limiting value for the whole fibonacci chain .",
    "this behavior was well described with the help of the effective potential approach summarized above .",

    "_ conclude that long range order effects give rise to measurable consequences on kink dynamics in aperiodic chains .",
    "further , they suggested that the fact that there are long range correlations in dna and , in any event , that it contains information and is not purely random , could lead to similar phenomenology in the propagation of nonlinear coherent excitations along the molecule .",

    "however , we do not observe any qualitative or otherwise relevant difference between the kink dynamics in the two regions .",

    "therefore , the hint from the fibonacci results that information may lead to different kink dynamical properties is , at least at the level of our simple model , not in agreement with the simulation results .    in order to assess further",

    ", height=377 ]    from this plot , we see that the most important difference between the two cases is that in the actual dna chain , the threshold value does not depend monotonously on the size of the unit cell ( note that the threshold for the periodic chain with unit cell of size 55 is the smallest one ) .",
    "it is still true , however , that the threshold is largest for the whole sequence .",
    "therefore , we are led to conclude that the information effect on the kink propagation along dna chains is certainly different of what we expected in terms of our simple fibonacci approach .",
    "notwithstanding , we want to stress that the analytical approach in terms of collective coordinates and an effective potential is a very good picture of the observed phenomenology even in this , more realistic setting . on the basis of this scenario , we suggest that the reason for the difference between the two models lies in the larger diversity available for possible dna chains .",
    "the fact that sites of type @xmath32 in fibonacci chains are always isolated is very restrictive as to the shapes and sizes of the peaks of wells of the potential felt by the kinks , and therefore the fibonacci model can not capture the richness of the dna model . as for the possible different behaviors between coding and non - coding regions ,",
    "we conclude that the englander model does not reflect the information content of the chain in the kink dynamics , which in principle prevents the use of this simple model as a genome sequencing tool .",
    "the results discussed so far correspond to the purely deterministic case , i.e. , they are related only to the `` disorder '' ( understood as inhomogeneity , even if it contains information ) present in the dna chains . however , a fully deterministic approach is not really relevant to the dna properties in so far as life takes place at nonzero temperature , and the same applies to single molecule experiments , usually carried out at room temperature .",
    "it goes without saying that there are many aspects of the influence of noise on the dynamics of the nonlinear excitations in dna , and that our purpose is simply to present the first results of two lines of research we are beginning to explore in this context .",
    "below we discuss the robustness of the deterministic results presented in the preceding section when thermal noise is considered , and how nonlinear coherent excitations arise from unstructured , noisy distortions of the dna chain .",
    "our first aim is to check the validity of the general description of the kink dynamics in terms of the effective potential in the presence of thermal noise .",
    "the reason for this is that , unless the scenario holds at temperatures of the order of room temperature , the insights provided by the effective potential about special places in the chain will not be relevant for the actual behavior of dna , either _ in vivo _ or in single molecule experiments . to this end , we considered the langevin version of eq .",

    "the applied force @xmath7 is below threshold , so for @xmath39 we observe that the kink is trapped at a position around the base pair 50400 .",
    "as we may see , it is necessary to add a large amount of noise ( note that the value of @xmath38 is twice the value of the threshold force ) to allow the kink to escape that well , and even then this takes place after a rather long residence time .",
    "other runs yield similar results .",
    "therefore , our preliminary conclusion is that the effective potential information is relevant even in the presence of moderate or large noises .",
    "pending a more detailed comparison with _ in vivo _",
    "temperatures , we feel that the available data is enough to ascertain that the model will behave qualitatively as single molecule , mechanical denaturation experiments carried out at room temperature .      in this subsection",
    ", we deal with the problem of the formation of nonlinear excitations in the model .",
    "this is an important issue in view of the fact that we are studying kink propagation using a kink as an initial condition , but we have not justified whether or not these kinks can build up from a generic excitation of the chain . for this study , we have considered one of the sequences studied in ref .",
    "specifically , we have taken the sequence of adenoassociated virus 1 ( aav1 ) , consisting of 4718 base pairs .",
    "the sequence contains the adenoassociated viral p5 promoter studied in ref .",
    "_ performed langevin simulations of a very short chain containing only the promoter and found that the chain exhibited preferential opening precisely at the so - called transcription start site . from their data , they concluded that dna dynamically directs its own transcription . by looking a the same sequence data these authors have analyzed , we simultaneously address the issue of the origin of nonlinear excitations and the confirmation of the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our simulations",
    ", we have again considered the deterministic equation ( [ 2 ] ) , which we now integrate starting with random initial data given by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 are independently generated gaussian random numbers .",
    "we have set the applied force @xmath7 to zero in order to check whether breathers and kink can be formed in the absence of directed external pulling , only from randomly distributed energy .",
    "dissipation is also zero in these simulations because otherwise all breathers would be suppressed in the long term ( while they survive in the presence of thermal noise , see @xcite ) .",
    "we have taken free boundary conditions , which implies that energy is not conserved .",
    "the reason for this choice is twofold : on the one hand , if periodic boundary conditions are used , a large amount of radiation is all the time present in the system , forming a background that masks the static breathers , formed and pinned by the sequence ( this is not the case with kinks of course , but in many simulations we obtain only breathers ) .",
    "free boundary conditions let this radiation go away from the system allowing to identify the relevant pinned breathers . on the other hand , in experiments with single dna molecules the energy in a single molecule is not conserved , as the chain deformations may be resolved through the free ends of the molecules .",
    "therefore , by using free boundary conditions we are mimicking more closely the experimental situation .",
    "we note that in doing so we are not in the microcanonical ensemble of statistical mechanics ; this is not a problem in so far as we are only interested in statistics as a way to quantify how often breathers or kinks form at specific places .",
    "finally , we mention that our chain consists of the base pairs from position 200 to 400 ( the p5 promoter goes from position 256 to 324 , and the transcription start site is at position 296 .",

    "the case represented here illustrates the effect of changing the mean value of the initial data , @xmath47 . in general",

    "our statistics so far is not large enough to give reliable values for the relative frequencies of each event , but we have seen that none of these outcomes is rare , i.e. , all of them are statistically relevant .",
    "hence , these simulations demonstrate that it is indeed possible to have nonlinear coherent excitations in dna chains , formed spontaneously from unstructured initial data .    as regards the comparison with ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found that when breathers are formed , they preferently locate in the transcription start site or its neighborhood . actually , in all the simulations we have carried out , we observe that breathers only build up in three different regions of the studied sequence .",
    "this agrees with the findings reported in ref .",
    "@xcite , although we need to do a much larger statistical analysis .",
    "on the other hand , preliminary analytical results show that the collective coordinate approach leading to the effective potential for kinks can be ( approximately ) extended to breathers .",
    "this extension , which will be reported elsewhere , predicts with good accuracy the existence of three potential wells roughly at the places where we observe the formation of breathers in the simulations .",
    "if this is indeed the case , the process would develop in two stages : first , breathers are formed by focusing of the initial data , and second , these breathers experience the effective potential and end up located at one of its wells . while this is an appealing picture , much more analytical work is needed to confirm it , and this preliminary report should still be taken with some degree of caution .",
    "in this paper , we have reported the first conclusions of our work on the effects of the genetic sequence on the propagation of nonlinear excitations along ( simple models of ) dna chains .",
    "the research was motivated by previous results on chains given by aperiodic sequences @xcite , which lead to the hypothesis that the information content of the inhomogeneities might be relevant for the dynamical behavior .",
    "while this general statement can not be ruled out at this stage , we believe that at the level of the englander model @xcite the simulations presented here do not confirm that hypothesis .",
    "specifically , we have not observed qualitative difference in the dynamics of kinks propagating along coding or non - coding regions . in this respect , it is important to realize that the function and information content of non - coding regions are far from well know , and it may well be that the dynamics in the two types of sequences is the same because the quantity of information is similar .",
    "this is certainly an interesting issue that deserves further attention . on the positive side",
    ", we have seen that a model as simple as ours is able to reproduce the main stylized features observed in mechanical unzipping experiments @xcite , such as the existence of a threshold to begin the unzipping process and the irregular time behavior of the force , which closely resembles stick - slip dynamics .",
    "this agreement suggests that , in modelling dna , the most relevant factor is the correct inclusion of the ` disorder ' given by the sequence rather than the mechano - chemical details of the interactions .",
    "another conclusion that we deduce from this research is the validity of the effective potential approach@xcite to the dynamics of nonlinear excitations in dna .",
    "although the precise dynamics of kinks is difficult to predict , this analytical approximation allows to identify the possible stop positions as well as the barriers that control the total opening ( mechanical denaturation ) of the chain .",
    "furthermore , the scenario that arises from considering the effective potential a good description of the kink dynamics leads us to speculate that the results of mechanical denaturation experiments on single molecules , with their stick - slip - like time evolution , could be also understood within simple models like the one studied here .",
    "this impression is reinforced by the fact that the effective potential approach works equally well in the presence of ( thermal ) noise , and by our preliminary report of its validity for breathers .",
    "work along these lines is in progress .",
    "finally , a few words are in order regarding our findings about the preferential opening of dna chains .",
    "we have qualitatively confirmed the results reported in ref .",
    "@xcite with a much more elaborated and realistic model @xcite .",
    "we want to stress that our study is not a langevin simulation and is not even a microcanonical simulation because of the free boundary conditions . with those caveats in mind",
    ", we can conclude that in the sequence we have studied there are three preferential places for breather ( opening ) formation , one of the most visited ones being the neighborhood of the transcription start site . in this respect , we want to point out that those locations may also be predicted by the effective potential approach .",
    "if that is indeed the case , it could well be that the analyses of longer chains would also reveal other preferential places whose significance should then be understood . in any event , we stress that our conclusions on this subject are very preliminary and that we believe that much more research is needed before we can reach definitive conclusions .",
    "we thank michel peyrard for many discussions about this work and for his patient explanations on dna dynamics .",
    "we also thank alan r.  bishop for making the results in ref .",
