    "the measurement of source morphologies in two - dimensional images is a fundamental problem in astronomy .",
    "the measurements of shape parameters are usually performed while assuming that the underlying noise is uncorrelated . however , spatial correlation of the noise is always present to some degree , and can significantly affect the derived parameters . in experimental situations ,",
    "noise correlation can be produced by various effects such as convolution of background light with a beam ( or point - spread function ) , interferometric imaging techniques , ccd readouts , etc .",
    "this effect is particularly important for measurements of weak gravitational lensing .",
    "weak lensing provides a unique opportunity to measure the gravitational potential of massive structures along the line - of - sight ( for reviews see schneider et al .",
    "1992 ; narayan & bartelmann 1996 ) .",
    "this technique is now routinely used to map the potential of clusters of galaxies ( see fort & mellier 1994 ; kaiser et al .",
    "1994 , for reviews ) .",
    "detections of the more elusive effect of lensing by large - scale structure have been reported by villumsen ( 1995 ) and schneider et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in small optical fields .",
    "the search for a strong detection of the effect on larger angular scales is currently being attempted with present and upcoming wide - field ccds in the optical band ( e.g. stebbins et al .",
    "1995 ; kaiser 1996 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "1997 ) , and with the first radio survey ( kamionkowski et al . 1998 ; refregier et al .",
    "the main challenge comes from the fact that weak lensing induces image distortions of only about 1% , and thus requires high - precision measurements of source - shape parameters .",
    "correlated noise can produce spurious image distortions and correlations in the shapes of neighboring sources , and therefore must be carefully accounted for in weak lensing studies .",
    "the effect of correlated noise is also particularly important for radio surveys performed with interferometric arrays . in such surveys ,",
    "images are produced by fourier inversion of the visibilities from a set of antenna pair . as a result of the incomplete visibility coverage , part of the noise on the image plane",
    "contains long range correlations which can extend across an entire field .",
    "the effect of these correlations is particularly relevant in the context of recent large radio surveys such as first ( becker et al .",
    "1995 ; white et al . 1996 ) and nvss ( condon et al . 1997 ) .",
    "while the present analysis was motivated by our attempt to measure weak lensing by large - scale structure with the first radio survey , most of the following is general and can be applied to any wavelength and imaging technique .",
    "condon ( 1997 ) computed the errors in gaussian fit parameters in the absence of noise correlation .",
    "he also gave a semi - quantitative treatment of the noise correlation which relies on simulations .",
    "in the present paper , we generalize his approach to include a general analytic treatment of the noise correlation .",
    "we show how the spatial correlation of the noise can be naturally characterized by the noise auto - correlation function ( acf ) .",
    "we explicitly derive the effect of noise correlation on source parameters for a general two - dimensional fit and for a two - dimensional gaussian fit .",
    "we also consider correlations induced in the parameters of nearby sources . in particular , we focus on the ellipticity correlation functions , which are used in searches for weak lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "we apply our formalism to the case of the first radio survey . after measuring the noise acf for one first coadded field ,",
    "we compare the noise - induced ellipticity correlations to those expected for weak lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "we show that , while they are important on small angular scales , noise correlation effects are negligible for source separations greater than about @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  [ noise_characterization ]",
    ", we define the noise acf and show how it can be measured in practice . in ",
    "[ general_fit ] , we consider a general two - dimensional least - square fit .",
    "we derive the bias produced by the noise correlation on the mean , variance and covariance of the fit parameters , and the correlation of the parameters for two neighboring sources . in  [ fit_gaussian ] , we apply these results to the case of two - dimensional gaussian fits and compute the error matrix .",
    "we explicitly derive the ellipticity correlation function induced by the noise correlation . in ",
    "[ first ] , we consider the concrete case of the first radio survey .",
    "we measure the noise acf for a first field , compute the induced ellipticity correlation function , and compare the latter to that expected for weak lensing . in  [ optical ] , we discuss the implications of this effect for optical surveys and related searches for weak lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "finally ,  [ conclusion ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a two - dimensional image with intensity @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the pixel position .",
    "the total intensity can generally be decomposed into @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the intensity of detected sources and n(*x * ) is that of the noise .",
    "we take the term `` noise '' to broadly refer to any intensity which is not associated with detected sources .",
    "depending on the context , it can include not only instrumental noise , but also the background light produced by undetected sources .",
    "we assume that , for each pixel , @xmath5 has mean and variance given by @xmath6 respectively .",
    "the brackets denote an ensemble average which , in practice , is well approximated by a sky average .",
    "if necessary , the first equation can be enforced be subtracting a constant term from @xmath5 .",
    "the noise is generally correlated from pixel to pixel .",
    "this is quantified by the noise acf which we define as @xmath7 where @xmath8 .    in the case of uncorrelated noise ,",
    "the noise acf becomes @xmath9 in the continuous limit , i.e. in the limit of small pixel separation @xmath10 , this can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the two - dimensional dirac - delta function .",
    "if the noise is gaussian and homogeneous ( i.e. statistically invariant under translations ) , its statistical properties are completely characterized by @xmath13 .",
    "generally , however , the noise is non - gaussian , and higher correlation functions are required for a full description . nevertheless , since our analysis only involves the two - point correlation function @xmath13 , it is also valid in the non - gaussian case .",
    "in addition , the noise is generally not homogeneous .",
    "for instance , the sensitivity and beam shape can vary accross the field - of - view and thus cause the noise properties to depend on position . in this analysis",
    ", we assume that this effect is small and that @xmath13 provides an adequate characterization of the noise , at least in an average sense .",
    "the noise acf , @xmath13 is easily measured in practice .",
    "to do so , discrete sources are ( iteratively ) removed above a given threshold . then , @xmath13 is measured by computing the average of equation  ( [ eq : eta_def ] ) over pairs of pixels separated by @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coadd ] shows a portion of a field in the first radio survey .",
    "the contrast was enhanced to make the noise more apparent .",
    "stripe - like patterns in the noise are clearly visible and indicate that the noise is correlated .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta ] shows our measurement of the noise acf for this field .",
    "sources were iteratively removed by excising pixels with intensities above @xmath14 , and by also removing an area @xmath15 ( 1 beam width ) in radius surrounding each pixel .",
    "the measurement of @xmath13 was then performed by randomly choosing pairs of pixels with separations equal to @xmath16 .",
    "the long range correlations reminiscent of the vla antenna pattern are apparent . in  [ first ] , we discuss the case of the first survey in detail .",
    "it is easy to show that , in the absence of correlation , the standard deviation , @xmath17 $ ] , of the measured acf is @xmath18 = \\sigma_{n}^{2}/\\sqrt{n_{pairs}({\\bf x})},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the number of pixel pairs with separation @xmath16 .",
    "this provides a measure of the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the acf measurement , namely @xmath20 \\equiv",
    "\\eta({\\bf x})/\\sigma[\\eta({\\bf x } ) ] = \\frac{\\eta({\\bf x})}{\\eta(0 ) } \\sqrt{n_{pairs}({\\bf x})}. \\label{eq : eta_snr}\\ ] ] in the case of figure  [ fig : eta ] , the number of pairs was chosen to be @xmath21 for all @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the snr for @xmath22 is 60 .",
    "this high value of the snr was achieved owing to the large number of pixels in the first field .",
    "as condon ( 1997 ) remarked , a natural example of noise correlation arises when part of the noise is convolved with a beam or point - spread function ( psf ) .",
    "the total noise is then a sum of a convolved component ( e.g. background light which gets smoothed by the psf ) and an unconvolved component ( e.g. poisson noise from the detector ) . for simplicity ,",
    "we ignore the latter component and suppose that the totality of the noise is convolved as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the intrinsic noise which is assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "the convolution beam @xmath25 is assumed to be normalized as @xmath26 .    as is easy to show using equation  ( [ eq : eta_def ] ) and equation  ( [ eq : eta_uncorr_cts ] ) for @xmath27 , the resulting noise acf is then @xmath28 with @xmath29 where , again , @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 can be thought of as the beam acf .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbeam ] shows the dirty beam for a typical first grid pointing .",
    "( the dirty beam is the image of a point source placed at the center of the field prior to cleaning ; see discussion in  [ first ] ) .",
    "the coadded field of figure  [ fig : coadd ] is a weighted sum of 13 similar grid pointings , and therefore does not have a well defined dirty beam .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to compare the noise correlation function of figure  [ fig : eta ] to this dirty beam .",
    "qualitatively , the resemblance is striking and reveals that most of the noise is effectively convolved with the dirty beam .",
    "there exist several methods for measuring the shape parameters of sources .",
    "the first method consists in fitting a model ( usually a gaussian ) to the two - dimensional source profile .",
    "another possibility is to measure the multipole moments of the source .",
    "the latter method is usually implemented using various window functions to ensure proper convergence ( e.g. schneider & seitz 1995 ; kaiser et al .",
    "the first method is more common in radio interferometric imaging ( e.g. aips software package ; see ` http://www.cv.nrao.edu/aips/ ` ) , while the second is usually used with optical images ( e.g. focas , sextractor packages ; see jarvis & tyson 1981 ; bertin & arnouts 1996 , respectively )    here , we only consider the effect of correlated noise on model fitting .",
    "an extension of our results to the multipole moment method is , however , straightforward . in ",
    "[ general_least_square ] , we derive the parameter corrections from the noise correlation for the case of a general two - dimensional @xmath32-fit .",
    "we include corrections up to second order in the inverse snr of the source . in ",
    "[ general_bias ] , we then compute the resulting bias in the mean (  [ general_bias ] ) , variance , and covariance of the parameters (  [ general_covariance ] ) . in ",
    "[ general_correlation_function ] , we compute the induced correlation in the parameters of pairs of neighboring sources . finally , in  [ general_functions ] , we consider general functions of the parameters .",
    "this analysis builds on the results of condon ( 1997 ) to include an analytical treatment of the noise correlation .",
    "let us consider a sector of an image consisting of a single source superimposed on noise .",
    "we then consider a fit to the two - dimensional source profile with a function @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is a vector of parameters . in  [ fit_gaussian ] , we will consider the case where @xmath35 is a two dimensional gaussian with @xmath36 consisting of the gaussian normalization , peak location , and size parameters ( see eq .  [",
    "[ eq : ai_gaussian ] ] ) .",
    "we assume that the fit is `` good '' , i.e. , that the source profile @xmath4 is well described by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the parameter vector that would be measured in an ideal measurement without noise .",
    "the total image intensity ( eq .  [ [ eq : i_tot ] ] ) thus becomes @xmath39    we assume that the fit is performed using the method of least squares , _ without _ accounting for the noise correlation .",
    "this is usually the case for most fitting routines ( e.g. aips ) . in other words ,",
    "the fit is performed by computing the usual functional @xmath40 ^ 2 } { \\sigma_{n}^2},\\ ] ] where the sum runs over all the pixels in the image and @xmath41 are the position of the pixel centers .",
    "the best fit parameters @xmath42 are found by minimizing @xmath43 .",
    "this minimum occurs when @xmath44 , that is , for the value of @xmath36 which satisfies @xmath45 \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial a_{l}}({\\bf x}^{p};\\hat{\\bf a } ) = 0 .\\ ] ]    in the noiseless limit ( @xmath46 ) , an obvious , if expected , solution is @xmath47 . note that in the most general case , there could exist more solutions if the system of equation is degenerate .",
    "we will not consider this complication here and assume that this solution is unique .    in the presence of noise ,",
    "the solution @xmath36 will deviate from @xmath38 . in most cases ,",
    "the integrated source flux is much larger than the integrated flux of the noise .",
    "this is quantified by the source signal - to - noise ratio , snr@xmath48 which we take to be much larger than 1 .",
    "we can thus treat the noise @xmath49 as a perturbation in equation  ( [ eq : chi2_minimized ] ) . for this purpose ,",
    "we rewrite @xmath5 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is a dimensionless parameter of the order of @xmath52 .",
    "we then expand the parameter vector in powers of @xmath51 as @xmath53 .",
    "we first focus on the bias induced on the source parameters by the noise correlation . by taking an ensemble average of equation  ( [ eq : ai_general ] ) , we find the mean of the parameter @xmath59 to be @xmath60 but from equation  ( [ eq : n_mean ] ) , we see that @xmath61 so that the first order term vanishes . using the definition of @xmath13 ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq : eta_def ] ] ) we thus find @xmath62 where @xmath63 the operand `` @xmath64 '' was added for future convenience . in the matrices @xmath65 and @xmath66 , the noise acf @xmath13 is averaged over the pixel pairs weighted by parameter derivatives of the source profile .",
    "the noise correlation therefore produces a bias in the fit parameters of the order of snr@xmath67 .",
    "note however , that this bias does not entirely disappear in the event of uncorrelated noise .",
    "inserting equation  ( [ eq : eta_uncorr ] ) in the previous equations , we find that , for uncorrelated noise @xmath68 thus , the ensemble averaged parameter becomes @xmath69 therefore , even for uncorrelated noise , the @xmath32-fit parameters are biased to second order in snr@xmath48 .",
    "this is not surprising : while the @xmath32-fit is always unbiased if @xmath33 is linear in @xmath36 ( see e.g. lupton 1993 ) , no such guarantee exist if it is non - linear .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath70 is indeed unbiased in the linear case .",
    "most two - dimensional source models , including the gaussian model , are non - linear in their parameters .",
    "the correlation in the noise then makes this bias generally more pronounced .",

    "the current version of the first survey contains about @xmath174 sources , and covers about @xmath175 square degrees .",
    "the survey fields were observed at 1.4 ghz with the vla in the b configuration .",
    "the @xmath176 detection limit of the survey is about 0.75 mjy .",
    "the pixel size for the survey maps is 1.8@xmath177 , while the restoring beam is 5.4@xmath177 ( fwhm ) .",
    "the restoring beam is thus reasonably well sampled .",
    "this allows us to take the continuous limit ( eq .  [ [ eq : cts_limit ] ] ) in our calculation .",
    "in addition , the relatively high angular resolution allows an accurate measurement of source morphologies .",
    "we are in the process of attempting to detect the effect of weak lensing by large - scale structure with this unique database ( kamionkowski et al . 1998 ; refregier et al . 1998 ) .",
    "because of the observing time limitations for a survey of this magnitude , the observations had to be performed in the snapshot mode with integration times of 5 seconds .",
    "the interferometric data ( or `` uv '' data ) for each snapshot pointing was then fourier transformed to construct a `` dirty '' image .",
    "the resulting pointing images were cleaned using algorithms adapted from the standard aips deconvolution package .",
    "the final survey fields were produced by a weighted sum of the grid pointing images . at a given point ,",
    "approximately 12 pointings contribute to the coadded field .",
    "sources were then detected and their shape parameters measured , using a two - dimensional gaussian fit .    even though the grid pointing strategy was designed to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio of the coadded images , the final maps still suffer from the limited uv - coverage of the snapshot pointings . as a result ,",
    "typical coadded maps contain small but noticeable `` stripes '' in the noise ( see figure  [ fig : coadd ] ) .",
    "in other words , the noise is correlated . as we discussed above , this affects the source parameters derived by the fitting routine . in particular , the effect of correlated noise is a potential systematic effect in a search for correlations in the source ellipticities produced by weak lensing .      as a specific case",
    ", we considered the coadded field 07210 + 29486e in the first survey . this field covers a solid angle of @xmath178 , with a pixel size of 1.8@xmath179 .",
    "figure  [ fig : coadd ] shows a portion of this field with the contrast enhanced to make the noise more apparent .",
    "bright radio sources are apparent in the right hand corner . in addition , the stripe - like nature of the noise is visible . for this analysis ,",
    "pixels with intensities above .6 mjy beam@xmath180 ( corresponding to about @xmath181 ) were excised from the field .",
    "the excised regions were then padded by 5.4@xmath177 to avoid contamination of the noise by the source side wings .",
    "the residual noise has a standard deviation of @xmath182 mjy beam@xmath180 .",
    "( intensities are quoted in mjy beam@xmath180 , were the beam refers to the restoring beam with a fwhm diameter of 5.4@xmath177 . )",
    "the median noise standard deviation for the first survey is 0.14 mjy beam@xmath180 , with 95% of the first area having a noise standard deviation less than 0.17 mjy beam@xmath180 ( white et al . 1996 ) .",
    "this makes the coadded field 07210 + 29486e somewhat noisy , yet representative of the first survey .",
    "figure  [ fig : eta ] shows our measurement of the noise acf , @xmath13 , for this field . for this measurement , the snr for @xmath22 is 60 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : eta_snr ] ] ) . for convenience , @xmath13 was normalized to 1 at @xmath183 in this figure .",
    "in addition to a prominent central peak , the acf shows marked radial structures .",
    "these structures are reminiscent of the vla antenna pattern and characterize the `` stripes '' which are visible in the noise .",
    "each grid pointing is characterized by a dirty beam .",
    "( it is the fourier transform of the uv coverage and is equal to the dirty image produced by a point source at the phase tracking center ) . in general",
    ", the dirty beam shape varies from one grid pointing to another due to differing geometries , flagged antennas , etc . as a result , coadded fields ,",
    "which are composed of several grid pointings , do not have a well defined dirty beam .",
    "it is nevertheless instructive to qualitatively compare our measurement of the noise acf with a typical grid pointing dirty beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : dbeam ] shows such a dirty beam for the grid pointing 07000 + 50218 .",
    "the qualitative resemblance with @xmath13 is striking .",
    "this shows that a large fraction of the noise is effectively convolved with the dirty beam .      of practical interest for weak lensing measurements ,",
    "is the effect of the correlated noise on the ellipticity correlation functions .",
    "figure  [ fig : ci_th ] shows the rotated correlation functions @xmath184 ,",
    "@xmath185 and @xmath186 ( eq  [ [ eq : wijrr ] ] ) for the coadded field of figure  [ fig : coadd ] . a source size of @xmath172 was chosen .",
    "this corresponds to a fwhm diameter of @xmath187 , that is to a deconvolved fwhm diameter of @xmath188 , for a restoring beam of @xmath15 .",
    "the source signal - to - noise ratio was set to snr@xmath173 .",
    "these parameters correspond to both the detection and resolution limit of the first survey and can thus be considered as `` worse - case '' parameters for a weak lensing search .",
    "the symmetric patterns of @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig : eta ] ) are also clearly apparent on figure  [ fig : ci_th ] .",
    "however , the patterns are different for each of the correlation functions . the first correlation function , @xmath184 exhibits a pronounced star - like pattern with radial elongation on each arm . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath185 is mostly characterized by a negative correlation close to the center . finally , @xmath186 exhibits star - like patterns but of much smaller amplitude than that of @xmath184 and @xmath186 .",
    "the last fact is expected for a non - parity violating noise pattern .",
    "figure  [ fig : ci_a ] shows the azimuthally averaged correlation functions , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath189 as a function of @xmath190 .",
    "these are simply the radial profiles of the rotated correlation functions of figure  [ fig : ci_th ] .",
    "they were derived by monte - carlo averaging over @xmath174 separation vectors @xmath16 picked randomly within a radius of @xmath191 .",
    "the thick lines correspond to a source size of @xmath192 , while the thin lines corresponds to @xmath193 . in both cases ,",
    "the source signal - to - noise ratio was set to snr@xmath173 , as before . for @xmath194 , @xmath170 is positive while @xmath171 is negative and drops off faster .",
    "note that both @xmath170 and @xmath171 are significantly non - zero well beyond the source radius @xmath111 .",
    "this is of course due to the long - range features in @xmath13 ( figure  [ fig : eta ] ) . at all angles",
    ", @xmath189 remains smaller and oscillates around 0 . as we remarked above ,",
    "this is expected for non - parity violating noise .",
    "a comparison between the thick and thin lines in figure  [ fig : ci_a ] shows how the ellipticity correlation functions depend on the source size . for larger source sizes , @xmath170 and @xmath171",
    "keep the same qualitative behavior but have a lower maximum amplitude and drop off more slowly .",
    "this is expected since larger source sizes effectively smooth out the sharp features in the noise acf ( figure  [ fig : eta ] ; see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : wij_circ ] ] ) .",
    "[ a_behavior ]    figure  [ fig : ci_err ] shows the long range behavior of the ellipticity correlation functions . for angles larger than @xmath195 ,",
    "a mosaic of 4 fields contiguous with 07210 + 29486e was used to compute the noise acf @xmath13 .",
    "the error bars shown for @xmath170 are the error in the mean derived from the monte - carlo sampling described above . since the separation plane was undersampled , these error bars provide a good estimate of the uncertainty in the correlation functions . as is apparent on this figure ,",
    "all three correlation functions are consistent with 0 for @xmath196 .",
    "as was demonstrated above , correlated noise affects the ellipticity correlation functions in the first survey .",
    "we now compare the amplitude of this systematic effect with the signal expected for weak lensing by large - scale structure .",
    "figure  [ fig : ci_theo ] shows the noise - induced correlation functions , @xmath170 and @xmath171 on a log - log scale .",
    "the absolute value of the correlation functions are plotted , with positive and negative values indicated by squares and stars , respectively . for comparison ,",
    "the ( absolute value of the ) correlation functions expected for weak lensing in cdm models are also displayed .",
    "the four models correspond to the cobe - normalized cdm models in table 2 and figure 4 in kamionkowski et al .",
    "models 1 - 3 correspond to a standard , tilted , and lambda cdm model , respectively .",
    "model 4 corresponds to a standard cdm model with a smaller hubble constant than that of model 1 . in all models , only linear evolution of density perturbations",
    "were considered .",
    "as we noted above , noise correlation produces significant biases in @xmath170 and @xmath171 for @xmath197 . in this angular range ,",
    "the noise - induced correlation functions exceed those expected for weak lensing for all models .",
    "( the inclusion of nonlinear evolution of density perturbations increases the estimates of the weak lensing signal for @xmath198 by only a factor of a few and therefore does not significantly alter this conclusion ; see jain & seljak 1997 . )    for angles @xmath196 , we showed above that the noise - induced correlation functions are consistent with zero , within the monte - carlo uncertainties .",
    "this can be seen by the alternation of squares and stars in figure  [ fig : ci_theo ] .",
    "the noise - induced lines in this figure should thus be interpreted as @xmath199 upper limits in this angular range .",
    "( a larger number of monte - carlo simulations could of course reduce this upper limit even further but is computationally cumbersome . )",
    "we notice that , for @xmath200 , these upper limits are almost one order of magnitude smaller than model 3 , the most pessimistic cdm model .",
    "as we showed above , the noise - induced correlation functions depend only moderately on the source size ( see figure [ fig : ci_a ] ) .",
    "most of the sources used in our weak lensing searches have sizes close to the resolution threshold ( @xmath201 , or , equivalently , fwhm deconvolved diameter of @xmath202 ) , and hardly ever exceed @xmath203 ( refregier et al .",
    "1998 ) . as a result",
    ", the noise - induced correlation functions in such a survey will be close to that shown on figure  [ fig : ci_theo ] .",
    "the monte - carlo realizations also allow us to compute the rms standard deviation @xmath204 $ ] of the ellipticity correlation functions .",
    "for @xmath205 , we find @xmath206 \\simeq \\sigma[c_{2}(\\theta ) ] \\simeq 1.9 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] .",
    "this is almost two orders of magnitude below the standard deviation produced by the intrinsic ellipticities of radio sources ( @xmath206 \\simeq \\sigma[c_{2}(\\theta ) ] \\approx 0.4 ^ 2=0.16 $ ] ; see refregier et al . 1998 ) . thus , statistical fluctuations in the noise - induced correlation functions are negligible for @xmath196 .",
    "the estimation of the noise - induced correlation functions for @xmath207 requires a large mosaic of coadded fields and is therefore computationally cumbersome .",
    "however , we expect the correlation functions to continue to be consistent with 0 at large angles . in addition",
    ", a search for weak lensing will comprise an average over the whole survey , as opposed to an average over a few coadded fields in the present study .",
    "the dirty beam , and therefore @xmath13 , varies from one coadded field to the next . as a result",
    ", we expect any long - range features in the noise acf to average out , leading to even smaller ellipticity correlations .",
    "we conclude that , in the first survey , noise - induced ellipticity correlations dominate over the expected weak lensing signal for @xmath208 , but are negligible for @xmath209 .",
    "while the effect is likely to be less severe than for intereferometric radio surveys , noise correlation may also affect source shapes in optical images .",
    "most weak lensing studies are performed in the optical band and are thus potentially sensitive to this effect .",
    "noise correlation in optical images can be produced by several effects .",
    "first , noise correlation can arise from the convolution of background light with the psf .",
    "because field distortions , diffraction spikes , etc , can produce anisotropy of the psf , this can induce ellipticity correlations .",
    "in addition , ccd readouts and charge - transfer efficiency can potentially produce linear features in the noise acf . finally , observing and image processing techniques such as drift - scanning , shifting - and - adding , and `` drizzling '' ( fruchter & hook 1997 ) can also produce features in the acf .    measurements of the noise acf in ccd images",
    "have recently been performed by van waerbeke et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , in the context of a novel technique to measure weak lensing shear with the noise acf . in one of their fields ,",
    "they find , at the center of the noise acf , evidence for a cross pattern which they tentatively attribute to charge transfer efficiency and/or the shift - and - add procedure .",
    "another application of their technique by schneider et al .",
    "( 1997 ) also indicates the presence of similar instrumental effects at the center of the noise acf for the three ccd fields they considered . in one of the fields , the central region of the noise acf",
    "is clearly elongated along one of the ccd axes . in another context ,",
    "vogeley ( 1997 ) measured the noise acf of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) in a search for fluctuations in the extragalactic background light .",
    "preliminary tests indicate that the extended wings of the psf of the hubble space telescope ( hst ) produce as much as 10 - 40% of this noise acf signal .",
    "these wings are probably due to internally scattered light .",
    "other effects such as flat - field errors could also contribute to the acf but are likely to be less important .",
    "the effect of noise correlation should not be overlooked in weak lensing searches with optical images .",
    "we have shown that the effect of correlated noise is of second order in the inverse source snr .",
    "one must therefore be cautious in correcting for systematic shape distortions using bright stars .",
    "while this technique , which is standard in weak lensing studies in the optical , ensures proper correction of the effect of the convolution of the psf with the sources , it would miss the effect of noise correlation .",
    "indeed , for stars with high snr , the effect of the correlated noise is negligible , while it could be significant for fainter galaxies used in weak lensing searches .",
    "it would thus be instructive to measure the noise acf in optical images with high snr and to compute the ensuing ellipticity correlations .",
    "this is one of the potential systematic effect in future high precision searches of weak lensing by large - scale structure with optical surveys ( see kaiser 1996 ; bernardeau et al .",
    "in particular , the drift - scanning technique involved in the processing of the sloan digital sky survey could produce noise correlations which would need to be corrected for in future searches of weak lensing with this database ( stebbins et al .",
    "the effect of noise correlation could also be relevant for the recent detection of galaxy - galaxy lensing in the hdf ( hudson et al .",
    "1997 ) , since this detection involves measurements of ellipticities at small pair separations ( a few arcsec ) with the under - sampled psf of the hst .",
    "we have studied the effect of noise correlation on the shape parameters in two - dimensional images .",
    "the noise correlation is conveniently described by the noise acf which can easily be measured in practice .",
    "we derived the magnitude of the effect for a general two - dimensional least - square fit .",
    "the noise correlation can produce a bias , and affect the variance and the covariance of source parameters .",
    "in addition , it can produce systematic correlation in the parameters of pairs of sources .",
    "we find that the effect is of second order in the inverse snr of the sources .",
    "we applied these general results to the case of most practical interest , namely a two - dimensional gaussian fit .",
    "we computed the relevant matrices explicitly .",
    "in addition , we explicitly derived the systematic bias produced by this effect on the ellipticity correlation function of source pairs . this is particularly relevant for weak lensing studies .    as a concrete example",
    ", we studied the effect of correlated noise on the shape of sources in the first radio survey .",
    "we measured the noise acf and found long range features which extend beyond the central maximum .",
    "we computed the resulting systematic effect on the ellipticity correlation function .",
    "we find that , in the first survey , noise - induced ellipticity correlations dominate over the expected weak lensing signal for @xmath208 , but are negligible for @xmath196 .",
    "we discussed the consequences of noise correlation for optical surveys .",
    "in optical images , noise correlation can arise from various effects such as the convolution of background light with the psf , ccd read outs , shift - and - add preprocessing , drift - scanning , etc . because the effect is quadratic in the source snr , the effect could be overlooked if systematic distortions are monitored solely with bright stars .",
    "the effect of noise correlation could thus be important for searches of galaxy - galaxy lensing and of weak lensing by large - scale structure in optical surveys .",
