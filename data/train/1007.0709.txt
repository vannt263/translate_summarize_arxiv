    "the transition between nematic ( @xmath1 ) and smectic-@xmath0 ( sm@xmath0 ) phases is interesting and important because it involves the breaking of a continuous symmetry as well as sharing some properties with the superconducting transition in metals and the superfluid transition in @xmath10 .",

    "the phase transition behavior is also sensitive to an applied external electric and magnetic field @xcite as well as with lc+lc mixtures @xcite . even though the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition has been extensively studied @xcite",
    ", there remains many unresolved issues regarding the fundamental nature of the transition .",
    "recently , attention has been drawn to the study of miscible mixtures of liquid crystals and non - mesogenic , low - molecular weight , solvents for broadening the basic understanding of mesogenic order , critical behavior and tuning viscoelastic properties @xcite .",
    "x - ray diffraction experiments performed on smectic-@xmath0 and smectic-@xmath11 thermotropic liquid crystals have demonstrated that the smectic layer spacing increases with the addition of organic solvents to the host liquid crystal indicating the formation of an organic lyotropic lamellar liquid crystal phase@xcite .",
    "it was suggested from the visual inspection that for octylcyanobiphenyl ( 8cb ) and n - hexane(hex ) mixture systems ( having a volume fraction of @xmath12 ) , the solvent is not uniformly distributed throughout the host lc and minimal , non - reproducible , swelling occurs .",
    "it was also suggested that the amount of solvent incorporated in a smectic liquid crystal depends on the host liquid crystal , nature and amount of solvent , and temperature ; noting that the mixture phase separates for a solvent to liquid crystal mole ratio @xmath13 .",
    "other studies of the effect of a biphenyl solvent on the splay and bend elastic constant and the rotational viscosity coefficient of 8cb observed an anomalous behavior of @xmath14 and @xmath15 near @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition@xcite .",
    "a theoretical study on the influence of non - mesogenic solvent on the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 phase transition using landau approach found a concentration induced tricritical point for the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition@xcite .",
    "this theoretical model also found that the frank elastic constants @xmath14 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 are modified as a function of solvent concentration near the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 phase transition .    a recent calorimetric study of the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition in mixtures of 8cb and cyclo - hexane ( 8cb+chex ) was performed under continuous stirring conditions @xcite .",
    "this study found a linear decrease of the transition temperatures @xmath18 with a linear increase of critical heat capacity exponent @xmath19 with increasing mole fraction of cyclohexane @xmath20 .",
    "this behavior ends at a tricritical point ( tcp ) where the transition becomes first - order at @xmath21 , just below which @xmath22 and the nematic range @xmath23 . for @xmath24 ,",

    "the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 critical behavior is strongly effected by the coupling between the smectic order parameter @xmath25 and the nematic order parameter @xmath26 . here , the @xmath27 is the amplitude of the one - dimensional density wave , @xmath28 $ ] , @xmath29 is the wave vector corresponding to the layer spacing @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a scalar parameter measuring the magnitude of orientational order on short length scales , and @xmath32 is the nematic director describing spatial orientation of the orientational axis on longer length scales . it has been shown by de gennes @xcite and mcmillan @xcite that a mean - field coupling between @xmath31 fluctuations and smectic order @xmath33 can drive a second - order @xmath1-sm@xmath0 phase transition first - order via a tricritical point . the theory proposed by halperin , lubenski , and ma ( hlm ) @xcite , taking into account the coupling between @xmath27 and the nematic director fluctuations @xmath34 , showed that the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition is always at least weakly first order which rules out the possibility of a tricritical point . combining both the @xmath35 and @xmath34 couplings introduces two more terms in free energy expression as compared to the usual standard form .",
    "one term is of the form @xmath36 which is nematic - smectic order parameter coupling ( referred to as de gennes coupling ) and the other is smectic order - nematic director fluctuation coupling ( hlm coupling ) @xmath37 .",
    "the former coupling reveals the effects of the elasticity of the nematic order prior to the onset of the smectic order and can drive the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition from xy like to tricritical to weakly first - order@xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath37 causes the anisotropic elastic deformations in the smectic .",
    "the strength of this coupling depends on the magnitude of the splay elastic constant @xmath14 which is directly proportional to @xmath38 .",
    "since it is expected that a low - molecular weight solvent miscible in an lc would affect both @xmath35 and @xmath34 fluctuations , the @xmath39 dependence would be accounted for using similar terms in a free - energy expansion .    in this work ,",

    "the dispersive part of heat capacity @xmath41 associated with @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition has peaks only for higher hexane mole fractions @xmath42 but not for the lower hexane mole fractions @xmath43 revealing the continuous ( second order ) nature of the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition for the lower n - hexane mole fractions @xmath43 and first - order nature for higher n - hexane mole fractions @xmath42 .",
    "the integrated ac - enthalpy increases overall as a function of hexane molar fraction whereas the imaginary part of the enthalpy reveals a sharp increase at hexane mole fraction of around @xmath44 and remains fairly constant .",

    "the non - linear increase in the heat capacity effective critical exponent towards its tricritical value @xmath46 is observed .",
    "the hysteresis of the @xmath40 shape on heating and cooling has been observed is likely due to a microscopic phase separation of the solvent , perhaps into intersticial region between smectic layers .",
    "the non - monotonic transition temperature shift may be due to the competing interactions of microphase separation and dilution effects .",
    "these effects may also responsible for the @xmath47 behavior with extended curvature as @xmath9 .",
    "these effects would also have profound consequences on the higher temperature @xmath48-@xmath1 phase transition as well , which was presented in previous paper @xcite .",

    "the 8cb and n - hexane mixtures appear to be miscible up to an n - hexane mole fraction of @xmath56 .",

    "<S> the continuous nematic to smectic-@xmath0 ( @xmath1-sm@xmath0 ) phase transition has been studied by high - resolution ac - calorimetry in binary mixtures of the liquid crystal octylcyanobiphenyl(8cb ) and a non - mesogenic , low - molecular weight , solvent n - hexane(hex ) as a function of temperature and solvent concentration . heating and cooling scans about the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 transition temperature were repeatedly performed on pure and six 8cb+hex samples having hexane molar concentration ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> all 8cb+hex samples in this range of @xmath4 remain macroscopically miscible and exhibit an @xmath1-sm@xmath0 heat capacity peak that shifts non - monotonically to lower temperature and evolves in shape , with a reproducible hysteresis , as @xmath4 increases . </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary part of heat capacity remains zero up to @xmath5 above which the distinct peak is observed , corresponding to a jump in both the real and imaginary enthalpy . </S>",
    "<S> a simple power - law analysis reveals an effective exponent that increases smoothly from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with an amplitude ratio @xmath8 as @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this observed crossover towards the @xmath1-sm@xmath0 tricritical point driven by solvent concentration is consistent with previous results and can be understood as weakening of the liquid crystal intermolecular potential promoting increased nematic fluctuations . </S>"
