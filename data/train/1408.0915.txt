    "gene transcription , directional intracellular transport and cell division are examples of important molecular processes required by all living organisms and performed by motor proteins at a molecular level through the transformation of chemical energy from atp hydrolysis into mechanical work .",
    "myosin - v is one such motor that walks hand - over - hand along an actin filament taking steps of 36 nm @xcite .",
    "the two heads of the protein attach and detach from the track in a mechanochemically - coordinated manner to ensure both motion towards the barbed ( or plus ) end of the actin and that many successive steps are taken before detachment @xcite .    over the last two decades",
    ", experimental studies have focused upon characterizing the behavior of myosin - v through dynamical walking experiments @xcite , kinetic experiments @xcite and other measures of stepping mechanics @xcite . however",
    ", this work has not yet fully unified our understanding of the underlying physical chemistry with all the experimentally observed behavior .",
    "many models of myosin - v stepping exist within the literature @xcite , but to the best of our knowledge a satisfactory biomechanochemical description that qualitatively matches all available dynamical data has not yet been proposed .",
    "explaining the experimentally observed average run length before detachment @xcite against both [ adp ] @xcite and [ atp ] @xcite simultaneously has proved a considerable challenge .",
    "furthermore , many models do not explicitly account for the underlying physical chemistry that places important restrictions on rate constants which can have a large effect on the described behavior .    in this article",
    "we compare existing myosin - v models within a single mathematical framework for the first time .",
    "comparisons are performed between models using the same set of differential equations to describe each model , with appropriate choices of parameters in each case .",
    "this allows us to ascertain which mechanisms included in existing models lead to reproduction of which experimental trends and hence to guide development of models that can reproduce them all .",
    "we use optimization techniques to match a model of a given architecture as closely as possible to experimental data , and this reveals that certain architectures or combinations of mechanisms simply can not give rise to certain experimental trends .",
    "we emphasize that this is not simply an exercise in parameter - fitting , but rather a systematic and informed exploration of model - space that allows us to unpick and rebuild model architectures - in terms of their reaction pathways - in order to match the available experimental observations . in this way we deduce energetic descriptions of myosin - v stepping that comprehensively capture the motor s qualitative dynamical behavior for the first time .",
    "our approach to model development has three aspects .",
    "firstly the identification of an appropriate model space .",
    "secondly an optimisation routine that identifies the closest match for a given point in model space to a subset of the available experimental data . finally , a comparison between the qualitative behaviour of the full set of experimental data and the optimised model to indicate the direction in model space in which we should move .",
    "we begin by describing the mechanisms that we include in candidate model architectures and use these to explore model space revealing two possible descriptions that achieve our aim . comparing the kinetic transition rates predicted by these two models with experimentally observed values lends tentative support to a mechanism including nucleotide - dependent futile cycling with nucleotide pocket collapse over one that involves mechanical motor detachment .    our model space ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sagefm ] ) comprises a set of mechanochemical states and state transitions , selected from the total set of states and transitions used in previously postulated models @xcite and incorporating experimental evidence that suggests that adp release is dependent upon the internal strain of the molecule @xcite .",
    "we include the following mechanisms :    * hydrolysis cycles * atp is hydrolyzed at two sites within the heads of the protein producing adp and phosphate and leading to internal strain that drives forward movement in a mechanochemically - coordinated manner @xcite ( for example : states @xmath0 ) .    * futile cycle * a loss of mechanochemical coordination causing atp hydrolysis but no forward motion ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "we define nucleotide pocket collapse ( npc ) as a decrease in intramolecular strain as adp is released from the front head under rearward force ( transition @xmath2 ) .",
    "* chemical detachment * a loss of mechanochemical coordination causing detachment from the track @xcite ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "* mechanical detachment * interaction with the bulk can cause spontaneous detachment , this is assumed to be unlikely at low external forcing ( state 4 @xmath4 @xcite ) .    *",
    "molecular slip * motors only weakly attached to the track can slip along it @xcite ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .    naturally the potential model space for myosin - v is larger and can include additional mechanisms @xcite , such as mechanical detachment from additional states , additional transitions and additional hydrolysis cycles .",
    "however , we present here the minimal subset that demonstrates how we use the experimental data to develop models of minimum complexity that reproduce all the observed trends of velocity and run - length with [ adp ] , [ atp ] and external forcing .     or @xmath8 and the nucleotide - pocket - collapse transition is labelled with npc .",
    "pathways : the main hydrolysis pathway ( all models , black ) , futile cycle without ( a1 , blue with @xmath9 ) and with ( a2 , blue with @xmath10 ) npc , chemical detachment ( b , red ) , additional pathways ( c , yellow and d , purple ) and molecular slip ( e , green ) . mechanical detachment occurs from state 4 ( f , cyan ) . , width=288 ]",
    "master equations govern the state - occupancy probability dynamics and we assume a renormalized steady - state solution @xcite ( see appendix [ apx : system ] ) .",
    "each state corresponds to a mechanochemical conformation of the molecule and the transitions between the states are described using the arrhenius expressions @xmath11 for a transition from state @xmath12 to state @xmath13 with an energy barrier @xmath14 and energy difference @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : energy ] ) .",
    "state transitions between any two states can take place either forwards along a cycle , in which case we denote the transition rate @xmath16 , or backwards , in which case we denote it @xmath17 ( as above ) .",
    "transitions to a less energetic ( usually forwards ) state only involve ` climbing ' the energy barrier and so the energy difference term in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : arrhenius ] does not appear , whereas transitions to a more energetic state ( usually backwards ) include both terms .",
    "transition rates between chemically distinct states scale linearly with the relevant nucleotide concentrations .",
    "for example the forward transition from state @xmath18 to state @xmath19 in which an empty myosin - v head absorbs atp occurs at rate @xmath20 \\tau^{-1 } \\exp(-g^{\\ddag}_{e - t}/k_bt).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] transitions where the molecule moves along the track are affected by external forcing ( @xmath21 ) , i.e. the load on the motor .",
    "for example the forward transition from @xmath22 to @xmath23 where the motor takes a substep and moves a distance of @xmath24 nm along its track that leads to an increase in intramolecular strain by @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is a fraction and @xmath27 is the maximum strain ) and atp is hydrolyzed , occurs at rate @xmath28 note that we have assumed that the distance between states in physical space is approximately the same as the distance to the corresponding energy barrier .",
    "relaxing this assumption would be likely to improve the fit to the forcing data ( fig .",
    "[ fig : results]c and f ) but we do not focus upon this here . see appendix [ apx : statetrates ] for a full description of the transition rates .",
    "and energy difference @xmath15 between states @xmath12 and @xmath13 as used in eqn .  .",
    "a transition from less energetic state @xmath13 to more energetic state @xmath12 requires ` climbing ' @xmath29 , whereas the reverse transition only requires climbing @xmath14.,width=288 ]    the velocity , dispersion and run length of the protein can be determined from the transition rates @xcite . for example",
    "the velocity @xmath30 is given by the forward flux through complete hydrolysis cycles and the forward slipping flux : @xmath31 , \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the step size , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the renormalized forward and backward transition rates respectively from state @xmath12 to state @xmath13 and @xmath35 is the renormalized steady - state state - occupancy probability .",
    "the transition rates are defined in terms of the energetic parameters included in eqn .  . these are determined numerically using a bespoke mcsa @xcite optimization routine , based on that developed by skau et al .",
    "for a given model and a given parameter set , the routine compares model predictions for dynamical quantities - such as velocities and run lengths - with a small subset of experimentally measured values and returns a cost function value @xmath36 .",
    "the parameter set that minimises @xmath36 corresponds to the best prediction and the routine numerically explores parameter space to find this set .",
    "optimized parameter values are subject to a sensitivity analysis .",
    "further details are given in appendix [ apx : optimisation ] .",
    "a given combination of mechanisms from our model space represents a model .",
    "we aim to find a model that describes experimentally - observed relationships for the average molecular velocity ( @xmath30 ) and run length ( @xmath37 ) against [ atp ] , [ adp ] and external forcing ( @xmath21 ) @xcite by optimizing the parameters of each model we investigate in an attempt to reproduce these trends ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : results ] ) .",
    "we found that force - dependent transition rates ( as in eqn .  ) and molecular slip are sufficient to give the observed experimental trends with @xmath21 and so include these in all models .",
    "the particular result that has eluded all theoretical studies that are based upon rigorous physical chemistry is that @xmath37 decreases with both increasing [ adp ] and [ atp ] ( denoted @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively)@xcite .",
    "this is where we shall focus our attention .",
    "there are at least two mechanisms that can give rise to these trends : nucleotide - dependent detachment ( where molecules are more likely to leave the system as nucleotide concentration increases ) or nucleotide - dependent futile cycling ( where molecules are less likely to walk forwards continuously as nucleotide concentration increases ) @xcite .",
