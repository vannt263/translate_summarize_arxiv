    "when a pure state , represented by a density matrix @xmath2 , is transmitted along a noisy channel , it is mapped into a mixed state @xmath3 .",
    "the entropy of the initial pure state is necessarily zero , i.e. , @xmath4 since @xmath5 and so the only eigenvalues of @xmath2 are @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "however , the entropy @xmath8 $ ] of the mixed state which emerges need not be zero .",
    "one seeks states @xmath2 which minimize the effect of the noise in the sense of minimizing the entropy @xmath8 $ ] of the state that emerges from the channel .",
    "there are a number of reasons for studying such states , most notably the connection between minimizing entropy and maximizing channel capacity , which will be discussed in section [ subsect : prelim.cap ] . however , in this paper we focus attention on the entropy .    the noise , which results from interactions between the states in a hilbert space @xmath9 and the environment , is represented by the action of a completely positive , trace - preserving map @xmath10 on the trace class operators in @xmath11 .",
    "we use the term _ stochastic _ to describe such maps .",
    "( following a similar use by alberti and uhlmann @xcite , this terminology was used by petz , @xcite and reflects the fact that @xmath10 is the non - commutative analogue of the action of a column stochastic matrix on a probability vector . )",
    "we restrict attention to two - level quantum systems in which case @xmath12 or tensor products of @xmath1 .",
    "a stochastic map @xmath10 acting on states in @xmath1 , can be naturally extended to tensor products , e.g. , @xmath13 acting on states on @xmath14 etc . , and leads to questions about the additivity of the minimal entropy and capacity of product channels .",
    "in particular , shor has conjectured that the minimal entropy is additive .",
    "we were led independently to this conjecture because it would imply additivity of channel capacity for _ unital _ stochastic maps , i.e. , maps which take the identity operator to itself so that @xmath15 .",
    "although we have a convincing argument that our results for entropy , unlike those for channel capacity , extend to non - unital maps , we focus most of our attention on unital maps . in the last section we briefly consider non - unital maps .",
    "recall that every completely positive map @xmath10 can be represented ( non - uniquely ) in the kraus form [ eq : kraus ] ( ) = _ k a_k^ a_k .",
    "every map @xmath10 representing noisy evolution in a quantum channel must preserve the trace of @xmath2 , since @xmath3 is also a state . in terms of the kraus operators , the condition that @xmath10 be stochastic , that is completely positive and trace preserving , is [ eq : cond.tracepres ] ( ) = & & _",
    "k=1^n a_k a_k^ = i .",
    "the map @xmath10 is _ unital _ if @xmath15 , that is if @xmath10 maps the identity operator to itself . in terms of the kraus operators ,",
    "the condition for @xmath10 to be completely positive and unital is [ eq : cond.unital ] ( i ) = i   & & _ k=1^n",
    "a_k^ a_k = i . a sufficient condition that a stochastic map be unital",
    "is that the kraus operators are self - adjoint , i.e. , @xmath16 .",
    "this condition is not necessary ; for example , a double - stochastic matrix which is not symmetric corresponds to a unital stochastic map which is not self - adjoint .",
    "henceforth in this paper , `` unital map '' will mean `` unital stochastic map '' unless otherwise stated .",
    "it is worth noting that the kraus operators are self - adjoint if and only if @xmath10 is self - adjoint with respect to the hilbert - schmidt inner product @xmath17",
    ". the dual or adjoint map @xmath18 is then defined by the condition @xmath19^{\\dagger } q = \\tr   p^{\\dagger } \\phi(q)$ ] .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath10 is given by ( [ eq : kraus ] ) then @xmath20 .",
    "in addition , since the dual of any trace - preserving map satisfies @xmath21 , any stochastic map ( considered as a linear map on the space of hilbert - schmidt operators ) has eigenvalue @xmath7 , and hence a fixed point @xmath22 such that @xmath23 .    for unital maps ,",
    "the identity is an eigenvector whose orthogonal complement is the set of operators with trace zero .",
    "hence , a unital map also defines a linear map on the traceless part of a density matrix .",
    "by contrast , a non - unital map is only affine on the set of traceless matrices .",
    "this distinction is easily seen for the @xmath1 case when the bloch sphere representation is used as described in section [ sect : notation ] .",
    "appendix c contains a list of examples of unital and non - unital maps .",
    "recall that the entropy of a density matrix can be written in terms of its eigenvalues @xmath24 , namely @xmath25 .",
    "the minimal entropy @xmath26 occurs if and only if one eigenvalue of @xmath2 is @xmath7 and all others @xmath6 ; the maximal entropy ( in @xmath27 dimensions ) of @xmath28 occurs if and only if all eigenvalues are @xmath29 so that @xmath30 .",
    "thus , if @xmath31 , one must have one eigenvalue close to @xmath7 and the others near @xmath6 . hence , states with small entropy are those for which @xmath32 . thus ,",
    "in seeking pure states @xmath2 which have minimal entropy @xmath8 $ ] after emerging from a noisy channel , we are led to seek states for which @xmath33 is maximal . in section [",
    "sect : norm.bnd ] we give a precise definition of the maximal norm and show that it is multiplicative when ( at least ) one channel is a unital map on @xmath1 .",
    "our results suggest that multiplicativity of the maximal norm may hold for general channels ; in fact , we can extend our result to some non - unital channels ( see remarks at the end of section [ sect : norm.bnd ] ) . in any case ,",
    "our results provide strong support for the additivity of minimal entropy for unital channels .",
    "another property of unital channels is that the entropy of a state is non - decreasing under the action of a unital stochastic map .",
    "this follows easily from the fact that the relative entropy h(p , q ) = p [ p - q ] decreases under stochastic maps , i.e. , [ eq : relent.dec ] h[(p),(q ) ] h(p , q ) since @xmath34 if @xmath10 is unital , it follows from ( [ eq : relent.dec ] ) that @xmath8 \\geq s(\\rho)$ ] .",
    "for a non - unital map , the entropy of a pure state can not decrease ; however , one can have mixed states for which the entropy actually decreases .",
    "we now discuss the information capacity of a noisy quantum channel @xcite , @xcite used for what is sometimes called `` classical '' communication , i.e. , communications in which signals are sent using quantum particles but without additional or prior entanglement between sender and receiver . in the simplest case where no entanglement is used in either the transmission or the measurement , each letter",
    "@xmath35 from the source alphabet is represented by a pure state which we represent by its density matrix @xmath36 on a quantum hilbert space . during transmission",
    "the channel transforms this state into @xmath37 , where @xmath10 implements the noisy interaction between states and the environment .",
    "the map @xmath10 is a completely positive , trace - preserving map on the set of states .",
    "the resulting state @xmath38 is measured , and the outcome determines a letter from the output alphabet . in the general case",
    "this measurement is effected by a positive operator - valued measurement ( povm ) ",
    "namely , there is a positive operator @xmath39 assigned to each letter @xmath40 of the output alphabet , which together satisfy the constraint @xmath41 .",
    "when the measurement is performed on a state @xmath2 , the result will be @xmath40 with probability @xmath42 .",
    "several definitions of channel capacity have been proposed , corresponding to whether or not entangled states are used for transmission , and whether or not entangled measurements are made by the receiver .",
    "bennett and shor @xcite identify four possibilities , which we denote @xmath43 and @xmath44 where the subscripts @xmath22 and @xmath45 refer to product and entangled processes respectively .    in the process described above , with no entanglement at either end , the channel is equivalent to a classical noisy channel with transition probabilities @xmath46",
    ". therefore its maximum rate of information transmission is given by [ shannon ] c_pp ( ) = c_shan ( ) = _ , , e _ i _ j _ i p_ij ( p_ij _ k _ k p_kj ) , where we take the @xmath47 over all probability distributions @xmath48 for the input alphabet , as well as all choices of input states and measurements .",
    "we call this the _ shannon capacity _ of the channel , since it bears closest resemblance to the classical case .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that by transmitting entangled states and by using entangled measurements it may be possible to exceed the shannon capacity for a noisy channel .",
    "the holevo - schumacher - westmoreland theorem @xcite , @xcite provides a closed form expression for the capacity in the case where product states are transmitted at the input and entangled measurements of arbitrary length are allowed at the output : [ hsw ] c_pe = c _ ( ) . here",
    "@xmath49 is the _ holevo capacity _ of the channel : [ holevo ] c _ ( ) = _ , ( s ( ) - _ i _ i s(_i ) ) , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the well - known holevo bound states that c _ ( ) c _ ( ) .",
    "holevo @xcite provided examples of channels in which this inequality is strict , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown @xcite that a necessary and sufficient condition for strict inequality is that the output states @xmath53 do not commute .",
    "one important open question is whether or not the holevo capacity can be exceeded when entangled states are used at the input , that is whether @xmath44 exceeds @xmath54 .",
    "this would be equivalent to the superadditivity of the holevo capacity . in this paper",
    "we address this question in the case of messages which are entangled over _ two inputs _ only .",
    "this is equivalent to the question whether @xmath55 exceeds @xmath56 .",
    "holevo @xcite has shown that @xmath57 for the quantum binary channel , but to the best of the authors knowledge there is no known example of a superadditive channel for the holevo capacity .",
    "bruss et al @xcite showed that @xmath58 for the depolarising channel , which is an example of a unital channel . as we will show",
    ", our results strongly suggest that _ if _ the holevo capacity is superadditive then the channel must be non - unital .",
    "we prove several theorems about the minimal entropy and the maximal norm for states of the form @xmath59 , where @xmath10 and @xmath60 are unital stochastic maps on @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an entangled state .",
    "in addition , we explain how these results provide evidence for the conjecture that _ minimal entropy is additive _ for all stochastic maps on @xmath61 .",
    "we also show that this conjecture has important implications for the capacity of unital quantum channels .",
    "in particular , we show that the conjecture implies that if @xmath10 is unital , then the holevo capacity is additive over two inputs , that is @xmath63 .    our first theorem concerns the maximal value of @xmath64 as @xmath2 varies over states on @xmath65 .",
    "we will consider the general possibility of two stochastic maps @xmath10 and @xmath60 on @xmath61 and denote their maximal values by @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively . in theorem [ thm : normbnd ] we prove , under mild conditions on one of these maps , that the maximal value of @xmath68 is @xmath69 , as @xmath62 varies over states on @xmath61 .",
    "that is , the norm of @xmath70 achieves its maximal value on product states @xmath71 , rather than on entangled states .    in theorem [ thm : mixing ] , we prove a similar , though slightly weaker , result for the minimal entropy of @xmath70 .",
    "namely , we restrict @xmath62 to the family of entangled states whose reduced density matrices @xmath72 and @xmath73 are such that @xmath74 and @xmath75 have minimal entropy .",
    "then we prove that the minimal entropy of @xmath76 , as @xmath62 varies over this family , is the sum of the minimal entropies of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "that is , the entropy also achieves its minimal value on product states .",
    "it seems extremely unlikely that we could further decrease the entropy of @xmath70 by using an entangled state whose reduced density matrices do not have minimal entropy themselves .",
    "therefore we believe that the conclusion of theorem [ thm : mixing ] also holds as @xmath62 varies over all entangled states on @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , similar arguments and numerical evidence support an even stronger conclusion , namely that minimal entropy is additive for _ all _ stochastic maps on @xmath61 .",
    "this is the content of the conjecture below .",

    "s.    we will discuss the evidence for this conjecture in detail in section [ sect : entanal ] and section [ subsect : nonu.min.ent ] .",
    "we note that p. shor @xcite earlier made a similar conjecture , and together with j. smolin obtained numerical evidence which supports it .",
    "the unital case is particularly important because it yields the following results as immediate corollaries .    if @xmath10 is unital , then the holevo capacity is additive , i.e.,@xmath77 .",

    "in section [ sect : norm.bnd ] we prove the multiplicativity of the maximum value of @xmath33 .",
    "section [ sect : entanal ] contains the heart of the paper in which we give the details of the proof of our theorem about additivity of minimal entropy . in section [",
    "sect : non.unit ] we discuss some of the features of non - unital maps using a special subclass and then present the evidence for additivity of minimal entropy in general .",
    "finally , in section [ sect : conc ] we summarize our results and discuss their implications for channel design .",
    "we also include three appendices .",

    "a non - unital map is one for which @xmath410 .",

    "the decrease in eigenvalues of the part of @xmath10 corresponding to the restriction to matrices of trace zero , is overcome by the contribution to the emerging state of the non - unital part of the map .",
    "we expect that this behavior is generic for non - unital maps",
    ".      recall the discussion in section [ sect : notation ] . for unital maps ,",

    "unless @xmath459 is perpendicular to the major axis , the ellipsoid in ( [ eq : ellip.nonunit ] ) will have _ only one _ state of minimal entropy .",
    "hence _ any _ entanglement will require mixing with a state of higher entropy . in the case of a map ( such as the fuchs map ( [ eq : spec.nonunit ] ) with @xmath460 ) for which the translation @xmath459 is perpendicular to the ( non - degenerate ) major axis of the ellipsoid , there will be two states of minimal entropy .",
    "however , because the translated ellipsoid is not centered at the origin , these two states will not be the images of two orthogonal states , but rather the images of two non - orthogonal pure states corresponding to vectors @xmath461 and @xmath462 .",
    "this suggests that the best candidate for a minimal entropy entangled state should have the form @xmath463 .",
    "however , after changing to orthogonal bases and using the svd decomposition ( [ eq : schmidt ] ) , this can be rewritten in the form @xmath464 where @xmath465 and , at most , only _ one _ state in each of the pairs @xmath466 and @xmath467 can equal either @xmath468 or @xmath469 .",

    ", a shift orthogonal to both major axes will yield a circle of states of minimal entropy ; however , that circle will _ not _ correspond to a `` great circle '' but rather a circle of constant latitude .",
    "such a circle never includes the image of two orthogonal states and hence the argument above still holds . in the case of three - fold degeneracy ,",
    "the image will be a sphere and _ any _ shift will again yield only a single state of minimal entropy .",
    "since the maps @xmath10 and @xmath470 differ only by rotations of the bloch sphere , the same conclusions hold for @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , our analysis suggests that for _ any _ pair of maps @xmath10 and @xmath60 , the states which yield minimum entropy under @xmath474 will be simple product states , regardless of whether one or both are non - unital .",
    "our main result in this paper is that channel capacity is additive for unital channels , where _ unital _ means that the channel maps the totally random input state ( whose density matrix is proportional to the identity ) into itself ( for example , every self - adjoint channel is unital ) . specifically , we present strong evidence that both the shannon capacity ( no entanglement for input states or output measurements ) and the holevo capacity ( inputs unentangled , but output measurements may be entangled ) are additive over two uses of a two - dimensional unital channel .",
    "this is the first result that establishes additivity of channel capacity for a broad class of quantum channels .",
    "we show that the problem reduces to finding the states of _ minimal entropy _ for two uses of the channel . if these minimal entropy states are _ product states _ , then this implies additivity of capacity .",
    "we then prove that one of two possibilities occurs : either these minimal entropy states are product states , or else they are entangled states whose reduced density matrices have greater than minimal entropy .",
    "we argue that the latter case is very unlikely ( numerical experiments confirm this ) , and so conclude that the former is true . as further supporting evidence , we prove that the maximal norm of states which emerge from the channel is multiplicative over two channel uses .",
    "our results rely heavily on the stokes parametrization and the properties of the image of the bloch sphere under stochastic maps . in order to extend them to higher dimensions",
    ", we would need an effective parameterization of the subspace of matrices of trace zero in higher dimensions .",
    "one can always write a density matrix in @xmath475 as @xmath476 $ ] where @xmath477 . however , for @xmath478 , we do not know what the analog of the bloch sphere looks like .",
    "we know only that its boundary corresponds to those @xmath479 with eigenvalues @xmath480 which is not the analogue of the surface of a sphere . without knowing the geometry of this region , we can hardly hope to answer the important question of how it transforms under maps of the form @xmath156 .",
    "thus , we have been forced to use indirect methods to reach conclusions about the states of minimal entropy emerging from @xmath156 .",
    "our results have implications for the design of communication channels .",
    "ideally , one wants to eliminate all noise .",
    "however , this will not be practical and one wants to know how best to allocate resources .    in the case of unital channels ,",
    "minimal entropy and maximal capacity are achieved if signal codes are chosen to correspond to the least noisy `` direction '' or polarization .",
    "( here , we use `` direction '' in the sense of the bloch sphere or maximum @xmath24 in our notation .",
    "this is unrelated to direction of signal transmission . ) hence , if maximizing capacity is the primary goal , then it would seem sufficient to minimize noise in only one direction .",
    "even if the orthogonal directions are extremely noisy , signals sent using optimal codes will not be affected . however , in this case `` classical communication '' becomes truly classical . if codes are restricted to one direction , then one is back in the classical situation with one choice for encoding @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "one has effectively lost the versatility of rotating the code basis as a tool for such purposes as signal encryption .",
    "non - unital channels have far more versatility , some aspects of which were discussed briefly in section [ sect : nonunit.sub ] . much more work needs to be done analyzing the properties of non - unital channels .",
    "thus far , most authors have looked for examples of particular maps which illustrate particular facets of stochastic maps ( such as fuchs @xcite example demonstrating the possibility of maximizing capacity with non - orthogonal states ) .",
    "our approach has been to try to find parameters which characterize subclasses of stochastic maps with certain properties . as summarized in appendix c ,",
    "most of the known examples of noisy channels can easily be shown to belong to one of the groups discussed in this paper .",
    "a complete analysis of non - unital maps would seem to require an extension of conditions of the type ( [ eq : af.nonunit ] ) to general maps of the form ( [ eq : t.nonunit ] ) with @xmath481 .",
    "in this paper we make repeated , and sometimes subtle , use of the singular value decomposition ( svd ) of matrices . in view of this , and of some confusion in the literature about the connection between the svd and what is often referred to as the `` schmidt '' decomposition , we provide a brief summary and review of these closely related decompositions and their connection to the better known polar decomposition .",
