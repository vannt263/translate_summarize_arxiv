    "plutinos are trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) that are in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune , meaning that in the time it takes neptune to complete three orbits of the sun , plutinos complete two orbits .",
    "plutinos are named after pluto , which was the first known resonant tno , discovered to be so by examination of a numerical orbital integration @xcite . this same technique is currently used to confirm the resonant nature of plutinos ( and other resonant tnos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "several of the first tnos that were discovered in the early 1990s were also found to be plutinos @xcite .",
    "plutinos are among the easier tnos to observe ; their semimajor axis of approximately 39.5  au places them near the inner edge of the kuiper belt .",
    "discovery is also helped by the high eccentricities many plutinos possess , causing close - in pericenters and lower apparent magnitudes , and thus brighter objects ( this is an extremely strong effect since the tnos are observed with reflected light , so their flux is proportional to distance@xmath3 ) .",
    "plutinos ( and other resonant tnos ) can have lower perihelia than non - resonant tnos because the mean - motion resonance protects them from close encounters with neptune ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    as of november 2012",
    "there were 244 plutinos listed in the minor planet center ( mpc ) database .",
    "however , only about 120 of these have high - quality multi - opposition orbits , allowing numerical orbital integrations @xcite to prove that the objects are truly resonant ( showing libration of the resonant angle ; see section  [ sec : resdynamics ] ) , and not just located near the resonance phase space .",
    "this paper will highlight the special selection effects caused by the kozai resonance within the 3:2 resonance .",
    "`` kozai plutinos '' are tnos that are simultaneously in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune and in the kozai resonance .",
    "pluto was the first known kozai resonator @xcite .",
    "what is now known as the kozai resonance was first described for high - inclination asteroids by @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs when a small body in orbit around a large central mass is perturbed by a third mass at high relative orbital inclination @xmath4 . in the case of the trans - neptunian region ,",
    "the small bodies are the tnos themselves , and the high relative inclination perturber is neptune , and to a smaller degree the other planets .",
    "any gravitational perturbations on the orbit of a small body cause @xmath0 to change .",
    "most of the time , this causes @xmath0 to precess , but under the special conditions that the perturber is at high relative inclination , @xmath0 will oscillate instead : this is the signature of the kozai resonance . when ` near ' the resonance in phase space , the @xmath0 evolution becomes highly non - uniform ( sometimes called the kozai effect rather than resonance ) . in either case , one observes coupled @xmath5 and @xmath4 oscillations correlated with the value of @xmath0 . for non - resonant tnos , @xcite",
    "show that the kozai resonance only occurs at extremely large eccentricity .",
    "however , inside mean - motion resonances , the kozai resonance can appear at moderate @xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is how pluto can show kozai oscillations despite being at the relatively low inclination of 17@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite presented the largest collection of plutinos that has been analyzed for kozai resonance , after combing the contents of the minor planet center ( mpc ) database at the time .",
    "they found that 22 out of 100 plutinos were solidly in the kozai resonance , with @xmath0 oscillating around 90@xmath6 or 270@xmath6 , and in one case around 0@xmath6 .",
    "unfortunately , the mpc database s collection of detections from many different non - uniform surveys does not allow for easy debiasing .",
    "because of this , it is very difficult to measure the true fraction of kozai versus non - kozai plutinos from this dataset .",
    "this manuscript was motivated by the results of the canada - france ecliptic plane survey ( cfeps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which detected and then re - acquired nearly 200 tnos , including 24 plutinos , to produce high - quality orbits and orbital classifications .",
    "this survey was well calibrated : tracking efficiencies and magnitude depths are precisely known for each pointing .",
    "because of this , the survey could be debiased to produce absolute populations .",
    "two of the 24 detected plutinos in the survey were found to be in the kozai resonance upon examination of a 10  myr orbital integration . because 8% of the cfeps - discovered plutinos were kozai plutinos , in order to properly debias cfeps s result to produce the absolute population and orbital element distribution of the plutinos , this kozai component had to be included and properly modelled @xcite .",
    "though this paper only discusses plutinos in the kozai resonance , @xcite also catalogued kozai resonators in the 5:3 , 7:4 , and 2:1 mean - motion resonances .",
    "other resonances can also exhibit kozai oscillations in some portion of the resonant phase space .",
    "this paper provides a basic understanding of the kozai resonance within the 3:2 , how the kozai dynamics affect plutino observations , and introduces possible uses for this resonance in distinguishing between different giant planet migration models .",

    "section  [ sec : nonkoz ] presents toy models of the 3:2 resonance ( sections  [ sec : pluttoymodel0 ] and [ sec : pluttoymodel95 ] ) , in order to demonstrate the effect of libration , and finally gives a realistic plutino distribution ( section  [ sec : plutrealdist ] ) .",

    "to orient the reader and make several important points , we first discuss toy models and then a realistic libration amplitude distribution for the plutinos , ignoring the kozai component until section  [ sec : kozplutinos ] .      due to the plutino resonance condition ( equation  [ eq : plutino ] ) , the location where the plutinos can come to pericenter is restricted",

    "equation  [ eq : plutino ] shows that the maximum excursion from the orthoneptune points occurs when @xmath22 is at a maximum or minimum .",

    "a direct consequence of the kozai resonance - caused oscillation of @xmath0 is that these objects always come to pericenter out of the ecliptic plane . because these are plutinos , we start with the same resonant condition ( equation  [ eq : plutino ] ) , and for this illustration choose @xmath27 : @xmath56 @xmath57 one can see from figure  [ fig : kozham ] that when the kozai libration amplitude is 0@xmath6 , @xmath0=90@xmath6 or 270@xmath6 . at pericenter , @xmath58",

    "<S> because of their relative proximity within the transneptunian region , the plutinos ( objects in the 3:2 mean - motion resonance with neptune ) are numerous in flux - limited catalogs , and well - studied theoretically . </S>",
    "<S> we perform detailed modelling of the on - sky detection biases for plutinos , with special attention to those that are simultaneously in the kozai resonance . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the normal 3:2 resonant argument libration , kozai plutinos also show periodic oscillations in eccentricity and inclination , coupled to the argument of perihelion ( @xmath0 ) oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> due to the mean - motion resonance , plutinos avoid coming to pericenter near neptune s current position in the ecliptic plane . </S>",
    "<S> because kozai plutinos are restricted to certain values of @xmath0 , perihelion always occurs out of the ecliptic plane , biasing ecliptic surveys against finding these objects . </S>",
    "<S> the observed kozai plutino fraction @xmath1 has been measured by several surveys , finding values between 8% and 25% , while the true kozai plutino fraction @xmath2 has been predicted to be between 10% and 30% by different giant planet migration simulations . we show that @xmath1 varies widely depending on the ecliptic latitude and longitude of the survey , so debiasing to find the true ratio is complex . </S>",
    "<S> even a survey that covers most or all of the sky will detect an apparent kozai fraction that is different from @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we present a map of the on - sky plutino kozai fraction that would be detected by all - sky flux - limited surveys . this will be especially important for the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) and large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ) projects , which may detect large numbers of plutinos as they sweep the sky . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath2 and the distribution of the orbital elements of kozai plutinos may be a diagnostic of giant planet migration ; future migration simulations should provide details on their resonant kozai populations . </S>"
