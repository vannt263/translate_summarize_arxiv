    "the following work is concerned with the detection of upos for large systems of odes of the form @xmath0 with @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "often eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ode ] ) is the result of a spatial discretisation of a parabolic pde . in this way",
    "dynamical system results can be applied to extended systems which exhibit chaos . over the past twenty years",
    "the periodic orbit theory ( pot ) has been developed and successfully applied to low dimensional systems .",
    "many dynamical invariants such as natural measure , lyapunov exponents , fractal dimensions and entropies  @xcite can be determined via periodic orbit ( a.k.a cycle ) expansions .",
    "it is an open question whether or not the pot has anything to say for spatially extended systems .",
    "it is thus an important numerical task to find upos for such systems in an attempt to answer this question .",
    "the model example of a spatiotemporally chaotic system is the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation ( kse ) , which was first studied in the context of reaction - diffusion equations by kuramoto and tsuzuki  @xcite , whilst sivashinsky derived it independently as a model for thermal instabilities in laminar flame fronts  @xcite .",
    "it is one of the simplest interesting pdes to exhibit chaos and we have chosen it as a test case for the work that follows .",
    "the problem of finding upos is essentially a root finding problem , thus a popular approach is to use some variant of newton s method .",
    "indeed , zoldi and greenside have reported the detection of @xmath3 distinct upos for the kse  @xcite . here",
    "they solve for the discretised system using simple shooting with a damped newton method to update each step .",
    "another recent assault on the kse by cvitanovi and lan use variational methods  @xcite . here a suitable cost function is constructed so that its minimisation leads to the detection of a upo .",
    "the main problem , however , is that newton type methods suffer from two major drawbacks : firstly , with increasing period , the basins of attraction become so small that placing an initial seed within the basin is practically impossible , and secondly , the method has no way of differentiating between true roots and local minima of the cost function .",
    "the latter drawback is one which increases significantly with dimension due to the complicated topology of multi - dimensional flows .",
    "the method of detecting upos by stabilising transformations  @xcite aims at transforming the system in such a way that its upos become stable . unlike in the newton - type methods , the transformations are linear and",
    "thus do not suffer from spurious convergence .",
    "when faced with the task of finding upos of a discrete system @xmath4 one can look instead at the related flow @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "it is straightforward to see that the period@xmath7 points of the map are equilibrium points for the associated flow . with this setup",
    "we are able to stabilise all upos @xmath8 of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : discrete ] ) such that all the eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath9 have real part smaller then one .",
    "in order to stabilise all possible upos we study the following flow @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a constant matrix introduced in order to stabilise upos with the jacobian s that have eigenvalues with real parts greater than one . given a set @xmath12 of such matrices",
    ", we have a family of differential equations which need to be solved in order to find all upos of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : discrete ] ) .",
    "one example of such a set was proposed by schmelcher and diakonos ( sd )  @xcite .",
    "it is the set @xmath13 of orthogonal matrices such that only one entry @xmath14 per row or column is nonzero .",
    "it has been verified that the set @xmath13 stabilise all hyperbolic fixed points for @xmath15 , and numerical evidence suggests the result holds for @xmath16 , but , thus far , no proof has been presented . however ,",
    "if we wish to extend the stabilising transformation approach to higher dimensions , the set @xmath17 can not be applied directly , since its size increases very rapidly with system dimension ( @xmath18 @xmath19 ) .    for high - dimensional systems with relatively few unstable directions , the method of stabilising transformations can be applied efficiently by restricting our attention to the unstable part of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : discrete ] ) . indeed , by constructing transformations which only alter the stability of the flow in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : flow1 ] ) in the unstable subspace of @xmath20 , it is possible to reduce the number of transformations considerably .",
    "the authors have recently proposed a new set of matrices @xmath21 based on the properties of a small already detected set of upos . here",
    "the cardinality is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the dimension of the unstable manifold at @xmath8 .",
    "this is the key to extending these ideas to higher dimensional systems , since often in practice the systems of interest are such that @xmath24 .",
    "for example , after a finite difference discretisation of the kse with resulting system of size @xmath25 , only four of the corresponding lyapunov exponents are positive  @xcite .",
    "thus at each seed we would have only @xmath26 matrices as opposed to @xmath27 if we used the sd matrices  .",
    "in what follows we take our leave from the subspace iteration methods  @xcite .",
    "consider the solution of the nonlinear system @xmath28 where @xmath29 is assumed twice differentiable in the neighbourhood of @xmath8 , an isolated root of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nlin ] ) .",
    "we can approximate the solution of ( [ eqn : nlin ] ) by a recursive _ fixed point _",
    "procedure of the form @xmath30 it is well known that the iteration ( [ eqn : picard1 ] ) converges locally in the neighbourhood of a solution @xmath8 , as long as all the eigenvalues of the jacobian @xmath31 lie within the unit disc @xmath32 . in contrast , ( [ eqn : picard1 ] ) typically diverges if @xmath31 has an eigenvalue outside the unit disc . in that case ,",
    "a popular alternative is to employ newton s method @xmath33    the idea of subspace iterations is to exploit the fact that the divergence of the fixed point iteration ( [ eqn : picard1 ] ) is due to a small number of eigenvalues , @xmath23 , lying outside the unit disc . by decomposing the space @xmath34 into the direct sum of the unstable subspace spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath31 @xmath35 and its orthogonal complement , @xmath36 , a modified iterative scheme is obtained .",
    "the application of newton s method to the subspace @xmath37 whilst continuing to use the relatively cheap fixed point iteration on the subspace @xmath36 , results in a highly efficient scheme provided @xmath38 .    to this end , let @xmath39 be a basis for the subspace @xmath40 spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath31 corresponding to those eigenvalues lying outside the unit disc , and @xmath41 a basis for @xmath36 , where @xmath42 .",
    "then , we can define orthogonal projectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 onto the respective subspaces , @xmath45 , as follows @xmath46 note that any @xmath1 admits the following unique decomposition @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . substituting ( [ eqn : xdec ] ) in eq .",

    "@xmath43 , @xmath44 , the schur decomposition is used . however , primary concern of the work in  @xcite is the continuation of branches of periodic orbits , where it is assumed that a reasonable approximation to a upo is known .",
    "since we have no knowledge _ apriori _ of the orbits whereabouts we shall need to accommodate this into our extension of the method to detecting upos .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , an alternative approach is supplied by the method of sts , where in order to detect equilibrium solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nlin ] ) we introduce the associated flow @xmath67 here @xmath68 and @xmath11 is a constant matrix .",
    "now , substituting ( [ eqn : xdec ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : flow2 ] ) and multiplying the result by @xmath50^{\\mathsf{t}}$ ] on the left , one obtains @xmath69 thus we have replaced the original eq .",

    "( [ eqn:1 ] ) of dimension @xmath56 and eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2 ] ) of dimension @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath70 and @xmath71 < 0 $ ] by construction , it follows that in order to detect all upos of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nlin ] ) , it is sufficient to solve @xmath72 where @xmath73 is a constant matrix .    in  @xcite the schur decomposition",
    "is used in order to construct the projectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "this is fine for continuation problems since one may assume from the offset that they possess an initial condition @xmath74 sufficiently close to a upo such that the schur decomposition of @xmath75 gives a good approximation to the eigenspace of @xmath31 .",
    "however , it is well known that the eigenvectors of the perturbed jacobian @xmath76 behave erratically as we increase @xmath77 . in order to enlarge the basins of attraction for the upos we propose that singular value decomposition ( svd ) be used instead",
    "that is we choose an initial condition @xmath74 and construct the svd of its pre - image , i.e. @xmath78 ( or in the continuous case @xmath79 for some time @xmath80 ) , the columns of @xmath81 give the stretching directions of the map at @xmath74 , whilst the singular values determine whether the directions are expanding or contracting .",
    "it is these directions which we use to construct the projectors @xmath43 and @xmath44 . due to the robustness of the svd we expect the respective basins of attraction to increase .",
    "it is not necessary in practice to decompose eq .",
    "( [ eqn : flow2 ] ) in order to apply the new st .",
    "rather we can express @xmath82 in terms of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . to see this we add @xmath85 times eq .",
    "( [ eqn:3 ] ) to @xmath84 times eq .",
    "( [ eqn:4 ] ) to get @xmath86g(x),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second line follows from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : orthog ] ) . from this",
    "we see that the following choice of @xmath82 is equivalent to the preceding decomposition @xmath87 thus in practice we compute @xmath84 and @xmath83 at the seed @xmath74 in order to construct @xmath82 and then proceed to solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : flow2 ] ) .",
    "the advantage of using the svd rather than the schur decomposition can be illustrated by the following example .",
    "consider the ikeda map  @xcite : @xmath88 = \\left[\\!\\!\\begin{array}{c } a + b(x_i\\cos{(\\phi_i ) } - y_i\\sin{(\\phi_i)})\\\\   b(x_i\\sin{(\\phi_i ) } + y_i\\cos{(\\phi_i)})\\end{array}\\!\\!\\right],\\label{eqn : ikeda}\\ ] ] where @xmath89 and the parameters are chosen such that the map has a chaotic attractor : @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "for this choice of parameters the ikeda map possesses eight period@xmath94 orbit points ( two period-3 orbits and two fixed points , one of which is on the attractor basin boundary ) . in our experiments",
    "we have covered the attractor for eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ikeda ] ) with a grid of initial seeds and solved the associated flow for @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 .",
    "this is done twice , firstly in the case where the projections @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constructed via the schur decomposition and secondly when they are constructed through the svd .",
    "since all upos of the ikeda map are of saddle type , the unstable subspace is one - dimensional and we need only two transformations : @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "figure [ fig : basin ] shows the respective basins of attraction for the two experiments with @xmath98 .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the use of svd corresponds to a significant increase in basin size compared to the schur decomposition .",
    "note that with @xmath98 we stabilise four out of eight fixed points of @xmath99 .",
    "the other four are stabilised with @xmath97 .",
    "the corresponding basins of attraction are shown in figure [ fig : id ] .",
    "note that for this choice of st the decision of which basis vectors to choose is not important , since eq .",
    "( [ eqn : cmat ] ) yields @xmath100 , so that the associated flow is independent of the selected basis .    .",
    "fixed points of @xmath99 with negative unstable eigenvalues are stable stationary solutions of the associated flow , while those with positive eigenvalues are saddles located at the basin boundaries . ]",
    "a typical approach in the determination of upos for flows is via a poincar surface of section ( pss ) . by `` clever '' placement of an @xmath101-dimensional manifold in the phase space , the problem",
    "is reduced to a discrete map defined via intersections with the manifold . however , a correct choice of pss is a challenging problem in itself . due to the complex topology of a high - dimensional phase space ,",
    "the successful detection of upos will be highly dependent upon the choice of surface .",
    "when the choice of a suitable pss is not obvious _ a priori _ , we found it preferable to work with the full flow , adding an auxiliary equation to determine the integration time @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the flow map of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ode ] ) .",
    "then we define the associated flow as follows @xmath103 the additional equation for @xmath80 is constructed such that @xmath80 is always changing in the direction that decreases @xmath104 , i.e. @xmath105 or , more precisely @xmath106 here @xmath107 is a constant which controls the relative speed of convergence of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : teqn ] ) .",
    "this leads to the following augmented flow which must be solved to detect upos of ( [ eqn : ode ] ) : @xmath108 =      \\left [        \\begin{array}{c }          c(\\phi^t(x ) - x ) \\\\",

    "\\end{array }      \\right].\\ ] ] note that the augmented flow ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) is derived by integrating a nonlinear pde for some time @xmath80 and will become increasingly stiff for larger @xmath80 .",
    "several approaches have been proposed for the solution of stiff systems of odes ; see for example , the review by shampine and gear @xcite .",
    "of all these techniques the general - purpose codes contained within the odepack software package @xcite are regarded as some of the best available routines for the solution of such systems .",
    "thus , in our numerical experiments we use the stiff solver dlsodar from the odepack toolbox to integrate ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) .",
    "dlsodar is a variable step - size solver which automatically changes between stiff and nonstiff modes . in particular , as we approach a steady state of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : augflow ] ) dlsodar will take increasingly larger time - steps , leading to super linear convergence in the neighbourhood of the solution .    to use the solver dlsodar",
    ", we must provide a routine that returns the value of the vector field ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) evaluated at a given point @xmath109 . here",
    "we need the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ode ] ) which is obtained by applying a suitable numerical integration scheme ; see the next section for further details .",
    "the odepack software package makes use of the jacobian matrix of the system being integrated and provides the option of computing the jacobian via finite differences or via a user supplied routine .",
    "note that in the case that the flow is expected to be stiff much of the time , it is recommended that a routine for the jacobian is supplied and we do this .",
    "the derivative of ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) with respect to @xmath109 is given by @xmath110,\\ ] ] where @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 as usual .",
    "quite often one might wish to terminate simulation before the usual stopping criteria of , for example , a maximum number of steps taken or certain tolerances having been reached .",
    "a nice feature of the dlsodar algorithm is that it allows the optional user supplied routine to do just this . to be more exact , it determines the roots of any of a set of user supplied functions @xmath115 and returns the solution of ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) at the root if it occurs prior to the normal stopping criteria .",
    "note that , to increase the efficiency of the algorithm we wish to avoid the following two instances : firstly , due to the local nature of the sts , we should stop the search if we wander too far from the initial condition , and secondly , since our search is governed by the dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : assflow ] ) and not by those of ( [ eqn : ode ] ) , we might move off the attractor after some time period so the convergence to a upo becomes highly unlikely . in our numerical experiments we supply the following function @xmath116 where @xmath117 is a constant and @xmath118 denotes the @xmath119 norm . in practice",
    ", we have found that there exists a threshold value of @xmath120 , such that convergence is highly unlikely once the norm of @xmath121 surpasses it .",
    "note that we also restrict the maximum number of allowed integration steps since the convergence becomes less likely if the associated flow is integrated for a long time .",
    "we must also provide two tolerances , rtol and atol , which control the local error of the ode solver .",
    "in particular , the estimated local error in @xmath122 will be controlled so as to be less than @xmath123 thus the local error test passes if , in each component , either the absolute error is less than atol or the relative error is less than rtol .",
    "the accuracy with which we would like to solve the flow ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) is determined by the stability properties of ( [ eqn : ode ] ) . to understand this",
    ", we note that in evaluating the rhs of ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) it is the solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ode ] ) at time @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath124 , which is critical for error considerations .",
    "suppose that our initial point lies within @xmath77 of a true trajectory @xmath125 .",
    "then @xmath126 lies approximately within @xmath127 of the true trajectory , @xmath124 , where @xmath128 is the largest lyapunov exponent of the system .",
    "since @xmath128 is positive for chaotic systems , the error grows exponentially with the period and we should take this into account when setting the tolerances rtol and atol .",
    "this leads us to the following settings for the tolerances @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the initial period and @xmath128 is the largest lyapunov exponent of the flow @xmath131 .",
    "we have computed the lyapunov exponent using the algorithm due to benettin _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the kuramoto - sivashinsky equation ( kse ) for our numerical experiments .",
    "it is the simplest example of spatiotemporal chaos and has been studied in a similar context in  @xcite , where the detection of many upos has been reported .",

    "also , in order to optimise efficiency we use the analytic jacobian in all our experiments rather than a numerical approximation @xmath184.\\ ] ] note that , in the case of the unconstrained system , the equations are as above , except that we set the last entry in ( [ eqn : augsys ] ) and the final row in ( [ eqn : augsysdf ] ) identically equal to zero .",
    "in addition to this we must supply the two routines with certain tolerances in order to control errors .",
    "let us denote the relative error desired in the approximate solution by xtol and the relative error desired in the sum of squares by ftol .",
    "in the computations performed in the next section we set the tolerances to the recommended values of @xmath185 further , lmder requires a third tolerance , gtol , which measures the orthogonality desired between the vector function @xmath186 and the columns of the jacobian , @xmath187 ; we also set this to its recommended value gtol@xmath188 .",
    "finally , we specify a maximum number of function evaluations allowed during each run of the lmder and na algorithms in order to increase efficiency .    for our method",
    "we use the set of matrices proposed in ",
    "[ sec : stabtrans ] with @xmath189 since within the low - dimensional unstable subspace it is possible to apply the full set of schmelcher - diakonos ( sd ) matrices .",
    "the upos determined from our search will then be used as seeds to determine new cycles .",
    "here we proceed in analogous fashion to @xcite by constructing sts from the monodromy matrix , @xmath190 , of the cycle @xmath191 .",
    "we then solve the augmented flow ( [ eqn : augflow ] ) from the new initial condition @xmath192 , where the time @xmath193 is chosen such that @xmath194 note that any given cycle may exhibit many close returns , particularly longer cycles , thus in general a periodic orbit may produce many new initial seeds .",
    "this is an especially useful feature , since we do not have to recompute the corresponding sts .",
    "initially , to determine that a newly detected cycle , @xmath195 , was different from those already found , we first checked whether the periods differed , that is , we determined whether @xmath196 for all previously detected orbits .",
    "if two orbits where found to have the same period , we then calculated the distance between the first components of @xmath8 , and all other detected orbits @xmath197 .",
    "however , in practice we found , that if two orbits have the same period , then either they are the same or they are related via symmetry , recall that if @xmath141 is a solution then so is @xmath198 .",
    "thus , in order to avoid the convergence of upos that are trivially related by symmetry we will consider two orbits as being equal if their periods differ by less than the tolerance @xmath199 . of course , this criterion can , in theory , lead us to discard cycles incorrectly , however , this is highly unlikely in practice .",
    "the search for upos is conducted within a rectangular region containing the chaotic invariant set .",
    "initial seeds are obtained by integrating a random point within the region for some transient time @xmath200 .",
    "once on the attractor , the search for close returns within chaotic dynamics is implemented .",
    "that is , we integrate the system from the initial point on the attractor until @xmath201 for some times @xmath202 , and use the close return , @xmath203 , where @xmath204 , as our initial guess to a time - periodic solution . in order to build the sts we solve the variational equations for each seed starting from the random initial point , @xmath205 , for time @xmath206 . in order to construct the matrix @xmath84",
    ", we apply the svd to the matrix @xmath207 the corresponding st is given by @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 , i.e. the first @xmath23 columns of @xmath81 in ( [ eqn : dfsvd ] ) . here",
    "@xmath23 is the number of expanding directions which is determined by the number of singular values with modulus greater than one .",

    "is defined as in eq .",

    "as before , the total work done per seed is defined as the sum over all matrices and is denoted by @xmath229 .    ) and the three detected orbits . here",
    "@xmath212 and @xmath230 . ]    for @xmath212 we where able to construct @xmath231 seeds from @xmath232 previously detected periodic orbits . from the new seeds we found a further @xmath233 distinct upos , bringing the total number of distinct orbits detected for @xmath212 to @xmath234 .",
    "an important observation to make is that both matrices perform equally well , as can be seen from table [ table7 ] .",
    "this is in contrast to the sd matrices for which the performance of the different matrices varies greatly ; see tables [ table1 ] and [ table4 ] .",
    "the result of using periodic orbits as seeds has , however , increased the cost per seed as compared with the cost of seeding with close returns within a chaotic orbit , see tables [ table1 ] and [ table7 ] .",
    "the increased computation is due mainly to the fact that the close returns obtained from periodic orbits are not as good as those obtained from a chaotic orbit .",
    "recall that the stabilising transformations are based on the local invariant directions of the orbit , and we would expect the performance to suffer as we move further from the seed .    for larger system size , where the system becomes more chaotic",
    ", the construction of seeds from close returns becomes increasingly difficult . for @xmath224",
    ", we constructed @xmath235 initial seeds from the @xmath236 periodic orbits using the method of near recurrences .",
    "here we detected only @xmath237 new distinct upos .",
    "it is important to note , however , that although we do not find many new upos for the case @xmath224 , the method is still converging for approximately @xmath238 of all initial seeds .",
    "also , in table [ table8 ] , the poor performance of the matrices @xmath225 , @xmath226 as compared to that of @xmath220 , @xmath221 , is due to the fact that only a small percentage of seeds were constructed from orbits with two positive lyapunov exponents .",
    "one advantage of using periodic orbits as seeds is that we can construct many seeds from a single orbit .",
    "figure [ fig : seed ] gives an illustration of three periodic orbits which were detected from a long periodic orbit used as seed .",
    "figure [ fig : seed ] shows the projection onto the first two fourier components of the initial seed ( of period @xmath239 ) and the three orbits detected whose periods in descending order are @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 . for each seed determined from a particular periodic orbit the stability transformations are the same .",
    "hence , the ability to construct several seeds from a single orbit , increases the efficiency of the scheme .",
    "we have presented a scheme for detecting upos in high dimensional chaotic systems based upon the stabilising transformations proposed in  @xcite . due to the fact that one often wishes to study low dimensional dynamics",
    "embedded in a high dimensional phase space , it is possible to increase the efficiency of the stabilising transformations approach by restricting the construction of such transformations only to the low - dimensional unstable subspace . following the approach often adopted in subspace iteration methods  @xcite",
    ", we construct a decomposition of the tangent space into unstable and stable orthogonal subspaces .",
    "we find that the use of svd to approximate the appropriate subspaces is preferable to that of schur decomposition , which is usually employed within the subspace iteration approach .",
    "as illustrated with the example of the ikeda map , the decomposition based on svd is less susceptible to variations in the properties of the tangent space away from a seed and thus produce larger basins of attraction for stabilised periodic orbits . within the low - dimensional unstable subspace , the number of useful stabilising transformations is relatively small , so it is possible to apply the full set of sd matrices .",
    "in fact , we have found that the subset of diagonal matrices of @xmath243 is capable of locating a large number of upos , although more analysis will be carried out in the future to determine if it is possible to detect all types of upos with this subset .    in conclusion , we have presented an extension of the stabilising transformations approach for locating periodic orbits in high - dimensional dynamical systems .",
    "future work will concentrate on rigorous mathematical analysis of this approach in order to determine the range of its applicability .",
    "we will also work on the development , within the stabilising transformations approach , of an efficient strategy for systematic detection of periodic orbits in high - dimensional systems ."
