    "filling of the 1d cuo double chain the static charge ordering does not appear due to the interchain transfer and instead of it charge freezing is observed in nqr experiment of pr124.@xcite we thus expect that the anomalous behavior of seebeck coefficient for both the as - sintered pr247 and pr124 is closely related to the presence of charge freezing .",
    "the 1d upper and lower bands of cuo two single chains in each double chain are separated by charge gap at the absence of the interchain transfer .",
    "because of weak interaction between the two single chains , both band edges of the double chain reach fermi energy and yield a small overlap in energy , leading to the compensated half metallic state .",
    "it seems that the value of @xmath9 oscillates along the horizontal axis upon lowering temperature below 100 k , indicating the existence of two kind of carriers such as electrons and holes .",
    "if in the half metal picture one lower band is almost filled , and another upper band is nearly empty , we then expect that holes are almost compensated with electrons .",
    "the present two band model also reproduces the experimental result that hall coefficient @xmath65 of the as - sintered pr247 below 100 k is , in its magnitude , much lower than that of the electron doped sample by reduction treatment.@xcite    for conventional metal , seebeck coefficient is expressed in such a way ,    @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the density of electronic state ( dos).@xcite here , we assume the energy dispersion @xmath69 of the double chain model given in ref .",
    "the inter - chain hopping integrals are neglected since their contribution to the energy derivative of the dos is very small except for the band edges near @xmath70 . by using the following formula and calculating the energy derivative of the dos as a function of the electron density @xmath36 ,    @xmath71",
    "the density functional band calculation then gives the calculated data as shown in fig.[s](b ) .",
    "here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 represent two fermi velocities in the double chain model , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 . from fig.[s](b ) , the electron density up to @xmath76 gives rise to @xmath77 in the case of @xmath78 , which is consistent with the experimental result .",
    "moreover , lower @xmath9 of the reduced sample at high temperatures near 250 k in comparison to that of the as sintered one supports a monotonous decrease of the absolute value of @xmath35 due to electron doping .",
    "the value @xmath65 for the citrate sample measured at 20 k is @xmath79 cm@xmath40/c ( not shown here ) , which is not so far from the data of pr247 prepared by high pressure synthesis .",
    "the effect on magnetic field on seebeck coefficient of the superconducting sample is qualitatively similar to that on the resistivity as displayed in the inset of fig.[s](a ) .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath9 for the superconducting pr247 up to 12 t does not approach the behavior of the as - sintered non - superconducting @xmath9.this finding also supports a quite difference in the electronic state between the as - sintered and reduced samples in pr247 .",
