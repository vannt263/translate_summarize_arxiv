    "as more and more customers subscribe to mobile broadband services , there is a tremendous growth in the demand for mobile broadband communications , together with the increased requirements for higher data rates , lower latencies and enhanced quality - of - service ( qos ) .",
    "fueled by the popularity of smartphones and tablets with powerful multimedia capabilities , services and applications , it is anticipated that by 2020 , the existing wireless systems will not be able to accommodate the expected @xmath0-fold increase in total mobile broadband data @xcite .",
    "therefore , 5 g cellular technologies are being sought . of the several enabling technologies for 5 g to handle the expected traffic demand , base station ( bs ) densification",
    "is considered as one of the most promising solutions @xcite .",
    "bs densification involves the deployment of a large number of low power bss .",
    "this decreases the load per bs and leads to a better link between a user equipment ( ue ) and its serving bs owing to a smaller distance between them @xcite .",
    "this bs densification also creates a multi - tier network of nodes with different transmit powers , coverage areas and loads .",
    "two issues arise in such a dense multi - tier network .",
    "the first issue is that the resource allocation ( ra ) in one tier can not be done in isolation of the resource allocation in another tier . in other words",
    ", one tier should take into consideration the consequences of its ra decisions on the other tiers .",
    "the second issue is that centralized ra solutions may not be feasible .",
    "hence , there is a need for decentralized solutions for ra in different network tiers .    in this paper",
    ", we formulate the ra problem for a two - tier orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) wireless network composed of a macrocell overlaid by small cells .",
    "the objective of the macrocell is to allocate resources to its macro ues ( mues ) to satisfy their data rate requirements .",
    "in addition , knowing about the existence of small cells , the macrocell allocates the radio resources ( i.e. , sub - channel and power ) to its mues in a way that can sustain the highest interference level from the small cells . for this reason",
    ", we formulate an optimization problem for the macrocell with an objective that is different from those in the traditional ra problems .",
    "now , since small cells create dead zones around them in the downlink direction , the mues should be protected against transmission from the small cells @xcite , @xcite .",
    "hence , knowing about the maximum allowable interference levels for mues , the small cells perform ra by solving an optimization problem whose objective function combines both the admission control ( ac ) and the consumed bandwidth ( i.e. , number of allocated sub - channels ) .",
    "the objective of the small cell tier is to admit as many small cell ues ( sues ) as possible at their target data rates and consume the minimum amount of bandwidth .",
    "again , this follows the same notion of tier - awareness by leaving as much bandwidth as possible for other network tiers ( e.g. , for device - to - device ( d2d ) communication ) . for this",
    ", an optimization problem is formulated for the small cell tier with the aforementioned objective , given the qos requirements of sues and the interference constraints for the mues .",
    "dual decomposition is used to have a decentralized ra and ac problem by decomposing the optimization problem into sub - problems for each small cell to solve . for this",
    ", only local channel gain information is used along with some coordination with the home enb gateway ( henb - gw ) @xcite .",
    "the key contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    * we develop a complete framework for tier - aware resource allocation in an ofdma - based two - tier macrocell - small cell network with new objectives , which are different from the traditional sum - power or sum - rate objectives .",
    "* for the macrocell tier , we formulate a resource allocation problem that is aware of the existence of the small cell tier and show that it is a mixed integer nonlinear program ( minlp ) . *",
    "we prove that the macrocell can solve another alternate optimization problem that yields the optimal solution for the minlp with polynomial time complexity .",
    "* we compare the proposed method for the macrocell ra problem to the traditional  minimize the total sum - power \" problem and show that the proposed method outperforms the traditional one in terms of the average number of admitted sues .",
    "* for the small cell tier ,",
    "we formulate a joint resource allocation and admission control problem that aims at maximizing the number of admitted sues and minimizing their bandwidth consumption to accommodate additional tiers , and show that it is an minlp . *",
    "we offer an upper bound solution to the minlp through convex relaxation and propose a solution to the convex relaxation that can be implemented in a distributed fashion using dual decomposition .",

    "[ raflow ] describes the ra framework proposed in this paper .",
    "given the rate requirements for the mues , the macrocell starts by allocating resources to its mues and specifies the maximum tolerable interference levels on each allocated sub - channel .",

    "this repetition , however , does not take place if ra and ac in small cells are performed by a central controller .",
    "note that the resource allocation in the macrocell from the first step remains fixed throughout the entire operation of the resource allocation process in the macrocell and small cells .",
    "the awareness of the macrocell about the small cell tier is reflected in the way the radio resources are allocated in the macrocell .",
    "the macrocell allocates resources to its mues in a way that can tolerate the maximum interference possible from the samll cell tier .",
    "note , however , that the minimum rate constraints of all mues must be satisfied in the sense that the rate requirement for none of the mues is compromised for admitting new sues .",
    "on the other hand , the awareness of the small cell tier about the existence of other tiers is reflected in the fact that the resource allocation in the small cell tier satisfies the rate requirements of the sues using the minimum amount of bandwidth resources .",
    "the macrocell is responsible for providing the basic coverage for the mues @xcite .",
    "hence , the target of the macrocell is to allocate the resources to its mues to satisfy their data rate requirements and specify the maximum tolerable interference level by its mues on the allocated sub - channels .",

    "one way of performing ra in the macrocell is to allocate resources to the mues in a way that maximizes the sum of the maximum tolerable interference levels on the allocated sub - channels .",
    "the motivation behind this objective is to allow the maximum possible freedom for the small cell tier in using the sub - channels . in this context",

    "@xmath43    in general , ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) is an minlp whose feasible set is non - convex due to c1 and the combinatorial nature of sub - channel allocation . besides , @xmath44 is unknown as the number of allocated sub - channels @xmath45 is not known yet . however , by carefully inspecting ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) , some interesting features can be revealed which lead to the possibility of obtaining the optimal solution of ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) with polynomial time complexity .",
    "we shall assume first that ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) is always feasible and that in the extreme case , an mue can have its rate requirement satisfied with one sub - channel only .",
    "the last assumption is possible thanks to the fact that the macrocell in our model has a control on the maximum interference level on the allocated sub - channel .",
    "the following lemmas reveal some of the interesting features of ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) .",
    "[ lemma1 ] at optimality , all data rate constraints c1 hold with equality .    since the objective function in ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) is monotonically increasing in @xmath46 and c1 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath46",

    "however , according to lemma  [ lemma1 ] , the objective function is monotonically increasing in @xmath46 , whereas the constraint c1 is monotonically decreasing in @xmath46 . therefore , we can decrease the value of @xmath50 on a certain sub - channel @xmath51 and increase the values of all other @xmath52 . in this way",
    ", we end up with @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .",
    "meanwhile , @xmath50 reaches a value @xmath55 such that the rate constraint for mue @xmath8 is met with equality resulting in a new objective function value @xmath56 which is clearly higher than @xmath57 .",
    "hence , the initial assumption of optimality is contradicted .",
    "recall that , a value of @xmath41 for a certain @xmath46 means that sub - channel @xmath21 is not actually allocated to mue @xmath8 .",
    "this leads to the fact that a system with @xmath58 sub - channels and @xmath59 mues , where @xmath60 , will end up with @xmath59 sub - channels only allocated to the @xmath59 mues which leads to a minimal use of the available system bandwidth .",
    "hence , @xmath61 .",
    "[ lemma3 ] the allocated sub - channel @xmath25 for mue @xmath8 is the one with the highest channel gain @xmath62 .    according to lemma [ lemma2 ] , at optimality , @xmath56 for mue @xmath8 , where @xmath55 is selected such that the achieved data rate on sub - channel @xmath25 is equal to @xmath9 .",
    "hence , from the rate constraint formula , @xmath63 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath55 is directly proportional to @xmath64 .",
    "therefore , to maximize @xmath65 , we need to maximize @xmath55 .",
    "hence , mue @xmath8 should be allocated sub - channel @xmath25 such that @xmath66 .    based on the given lemmas , we have the following theorem .",
    "to maximize the sum of tolerable interference levels , the macrocell can solve the following alternate optimization problem : @xmath67    where the objective in ( [ macro_pb4 ] ) is to maximize the sum of the allocated sub - channel gains .",
    "c1 restricts the number of allocated sub - channels to any mue @xmath8 to one sub - channel only , whereas c2 restricts sub - channel @xmath21 to be allocated to at most one mue .",
    "then for each mue @xmath8 with allocated sub - channel @xmath21 , the maximum tolerable interference level is given by : @xmath68 .",
    "hence , ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) is solved optimally .    according to lemmas [ lemma2 ] and [ lemma3 ] , at optimality",
    ", each mue will have only one sub - channel which is the one with the highest gain .",
    "hence , we can define the optimization problem in ( [ macro_pb4 ] ) which is the well - known assignment problem that can be efficiently solved in polynomial time using the hungarian method @xcite .    in this way",
    ", the macrocell allocates sub - channels to its mues in a way that satisfies their data rate requirements and that can tolerate the maximum possible interference from the small cell tier .      as a baseline",
    ", we consider another way of performing ra in the macrocell by minimizing the total sum - power of the macrocell given the data rate requirements of the mues .",
    "this problem has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite . however , the formulation developed in @xcite does not account for the maximum tolerable interference level @xmath46 .",
    "hence , we include it here with the required modification to determine the maximum tolerable interference level @xmath46 .",
    "we have , thus , the following optimization problem :    @xmath69    in ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) , given the maximum tolerable interference level on each allocated sub - channel @xmath31 , the macrocell seeks a power and sub - channel allocation solution that minimizes the sum - power .",
    "although ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) is an minlp whose feasible set is non - convex , it has been solved efficiently in @xcite in the dual domain using dual decomposition relying on the fact that the duality gap becomes virtually zero when the number of sub - channels in the system is sufficiently large .",
    "the reason for choosing the resource allocation solution based on the formulation in ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) as the baseline is the following . with this solution , at optimality , all mues have their rate requirements satisfied with equality .",
    "this is also the case for the solution obtained from the formulation in ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) .",
    "in other words , with both the solutions , the mues achieve the same performance .",
    "the difference however lies in the way the resources are allocated , which subsequently impacts the performance of the small cell tier .    in ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) ,",
    "the same value of @xmath31 is assumed @xmath70 , i.e. , @xmath71 . for a further fair comparison between ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) and ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) ,",
    "the macrocell adjusts the maximum tolerable interference level @xmath72 such that @xmath73 .",
    "this can be accomplished by using the bisection method according to * algorithm [ alg_2 ] * as given below , where @xmath74 .",
    "macrocell initializes @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 @xmath78 macrocell solves the optimization problem in ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) @xmath79 @xmath80    [ alg_2 ]    after * algorithm [ alg_2 ] * terminates , @xmath81 gives the optimal value of @xmath72 .",
    "the optimization problem in ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) ends up with the power and sub - channel allocation to the mues with a uniform maximum tolerable interference level @xmath72 on all allocated sub - channels . in general , as will be shown in the numerical results , ( [ macro_pb5 ] ) leads to a higher number of allocated sub - channels to the mues than that ( [ macro_pb3 ] ) does .",
    "it is of interest to study the effect of the two different ra methods on the small cell tier .      due to the small distance and the good channel conditions between small cells and sues , small cells are capable of serving registered sues with higher data rates than the macrocell .",
    "however , this should not be at the cost of qos degradation at mues as they are served by the macrocell and provided with basic coverage at possibly lower rates @xcite . hence , given the maximum tolerable interference levels on each allocated sub - channel for the mues , each small cell now tries to admit as many sues as possible at their target data rate by using the minimum possible bandwidth .",
    "again , the idea here is to leave as much bandwidth as possible for the other network tiers ( e.g. , for device - to - device ( d2d ) communication ) .      to accomplish the aforementioned requirements",
    ", we define the optimization problem in ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) , where the objective function accounts for both admission control and sub - channel allocation .",
    "we have the admission control variable @xmath82 which takes the value of @xmath83 if sue @xmath12 is admitted in small cell @xmath14 and @xmath26 otherwise . by controlling the weighting factor",
    "@xmath84 $ ] , admission control can be given higher priority over the number of used sub - channels .",
    "@xmath85    [ prop1 ] by choosing @xmath86 , ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) admits the maximum number of sues while consuming the minimum number of sub - channels .    this proposition can be proved in a way similar to that in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath87 , @xmath88 denote an optimal solution of ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath89 , @xmath88 be a feasible solution that admits one more sue than the optimal solution , i.e. , @xmath90 .",
    "the objective of the feasible solution can be written as : @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 @xmath94 the first inequality holds due to the fact that @xmath95 is upper bounded by @xmath96 when all sub - channels in all small cells are allocated .",
    "the second inequality holds by setting @xmath97 .",
    "hence , we have @xmath86 .",
    "the last inequality holds due to the non - negativity of @xmath98 . in this way , the value of the objective function for the feasible solution is higher than the optimal one , which contradicts the optimality of @xmath87 .",

    "the problem in ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) is an minlp whose feasible set is non - convex due to the combinatorial nature of sub - channel allocation and admission control .",
    "however , for small - sized problems , we use opti @xcite , which is a matlab toolbox to construct and solve linear , nonlinear , continuous and discrete optimization problems , to obtain the optimal solution .",
    "obtaining the optimal solution , however , for larger problems is intractable .",
    "another approach that can render the problem in ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) more tractable is to have a convex reformulation of ( [ femto_pb1 ] ) by relaxing the constraints c7 and c8 and allowing @xmath105 and @xmath82 to take any value in the range @xmath108 $ ] .",
