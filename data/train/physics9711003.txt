    "the behavior and structure of matter in the presence of strong external magnetic fields is a research area of increasing interest .",
    "this increasing interest is motivated by the occurence of strong fields and strong field effects in different branches of physics like astrophysics @xcite , atomic and molecular physics of rydberg states @xcite and certain areas of solid state physics like excitons and/or quantum nano structures @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical investigations were performed concerning the properties of atomic and molecular systems in strong magnetic fields .",
    "most of them however deal with the hydrogen atom . for molecular systems",
    "only the electronic structure of the @xmath14 ion was investigated in some detail ( see refs . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "very interesting phenomena can be observed already for this simple diatomic system . for the ground state of the @xmath14 molecule",
    "the dissociation energy increases and the equilibrium internuclear distance simultaneously decreases with increasing field strength . furthermore it was shown @xcite that a certain class of excited electronic states , which possess a purely repulsive potential energy surface in the absence of a magnetic field , acquire a well - pronounced potential well in a sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "moreover the electronic potential energies depend not only on the internuclear distance but also on the angle between the magnetic field and molecular axes which leads to a very complex topological behavior of the corresponding potential energy surfaces @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath14 ion there exist only a few investigations dealing with the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule in the presence of a strong magnetic field .",
    "highly excited states of @xmath15 were studied for a field strength of @xmath16 in ref .",
    "for intermediate field strengths two studies of almost qualitative character investigate the potential energy curve ( pec ) of the lowest @xmath5 state @xcite .",
    "a few investigations were performed in the high field limit @xcite , where the magnetic forces dominate over the coulomb forces and therefore several approximations can be performed . very recently",
    "a first step has been done in order to elucidate the electronic structure of the @xmath15 molecule for the parallel configuration , i.e. for parallel internuclear and magnetic field axes @xcite . in that investigation",
    "the ground states of the @xmath17 manifold were studied for gerade and ungerade parity as well as singlet and triplet states .",
    "hereby accurate adiabatic electronic energies were obtained for a broad range of field strengths from field free space up to strong magnetic fields of @xmath18 a variety of interesting effects were revealed . as in the case of the @xmath14 ion , the lowest strongly bound states ,",
    "i.e. the lowest @xmath5 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 state , show a decrease of the bond length and an increase in the dissociation energy for sufficiently strong fields .",
    "furthermore a change in the dissociation channel occurs for the lowest @xmath20 state between @xmath21 and @xmath22 due to the existence of strongly bound @xmath23 states in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the @xmath19 state was shown to exhibit an additional outer minimum for intermediate field strengths which could provide vibrationally bound states .",
    "an important result of ref .",
    "@xcite is the change of the ground state from the lowest @xmath5 state to the lowest @xmath6 state between @xmath24 and @xmath25 this crossing is of particular relevance for the existence of molecular hydrogen in the vicinity of white dwarfs .",
    "the @xmath6 state is an unbound state and possesses only a very shallow van der waals minimum which does not provide any vibrational level .",
    "therefore , the ground state of the hydrogen molecule for the parallel configuration is an unbound state for @xmath26 up to some much higher critical field strength @xmath4 which is not known exactly . in ref . @xcite it has been shown that for very strong fields ( @xmath27 ) the strongly bound @xmath7 state is the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule oriented parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "therefore a second transition which involves the unbound @xmath6 and the strongly bound @xmath7 state has to occur at some field strength between @xmath28 and @xmath29    the above considerations show that detailed studies of the electronic properties of the hydrogen molecule in a magnetic field are very desirable .",
    "the present investigation deals with the electronic structure of the lowest states of the important @xmath0 subspace , i.e. the lowest singlet and triplet@xmath30 states with gerade and ungerade parity .",
    "this subspace contains , as mentioned above , the global ground state of the @xmath15 molecule for sufficiently strong magnetic fields .",
    "we hereby consider the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic field axes .",
    "the parallel configuration is distinct by its high symmetry compared to the case of an arbitrary angle between the internuclear and magnetic field axes and is expected to play an important role for the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule @xcite .",
    "the results of our calculations include accurate adiabatic pecs for the complete range of field strengths @xmath2 we present detailed data for the total and dissociation energies , equilibrium internuclear distances and positions of maxima for the corresponding electronic states .",
    "moreover we provide a discussion of the global ground state of the parallel configuration and give the transition field strengths for the crossings between the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 states .    in detail",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "the total pseudomomentum is a constant of motion and therefore commutes with the hamiltonian @xcite . for that reason",
    "the hamiltonian can be simplified by performing a so - called pseudoseparation of the center of mass motion @xcite which introduces the center of mass coordinate and the conserved pseudomomentum as a pair of canonical conjugated variables .",
    "further simplifications can be achieved by a consecutive series of unitary transformations @xcite .    in order to separate the electronic and nuclear motion we perform the born - oppenheimer approximation in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite . as a first order approximation",
    "we assume infinitely heavy masses for the nuclei .",
    "the origin of our coordinate system coincides with the midpoint of the internuclear axis of the hydrogen molecule and the protons are located on the @xmath32 axis .",
    "the magnetic field is chosen parallel to the @xmath32 axis of our coordinate system and the symmetric gauge is adopted for the vector potential .",
    "the gyromagnetic factor of the electron is chosen to be equal to two .",
    "the hamiltonian , therefore , takes on the following appearance : @xmath33 the symbols @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the position vectors , the canonical conjugated momenta and the angular momenta of the two electrons , respectively . @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the vectors of the magnetic field and internuclear distance , respectively and @xmath39 denotes the magnitude of @xmath38 . with @xmath40",
    "we denote the vector of the total electronic spin . throughout the paper we will use atomic units .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ form1 ] ) commutes with the following operators : the parity operator @xmath41 , the projection @xmath42 of the electronic angular momentum on the internuclear axis , the square @xmath43 of the total electronic spin and the projection @xmath44 of the total electronic spin on the internuclear axis . in the case of field",
    "free space we encounter an additional independent symmetry namely the reflections of the electronic coordinates at the @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) plane .",
    "the eigenfunctions possess the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath47 .",
    "this symmetry does not hold in the presence of a magnetic field ! therefore , the resulting symmetry groups for the hydrogen molecule are @xmath48 in the case of field free space and @xmath49 in the presence of a magnetic field @xcite .    in order to solve the fixed - nuclei electronic schrdinger equation belonging to the hamiltonian ( [ form1 ] ) we expand the electronic eigenfunctions in terms of molecular configurations . in a first step",

    "the overall accuracy of our results in the energy is estimated to be typically better than @xmath74 and for some cases better than @xmath74 .",

    "this behavior is of importance for the singlet - triplet energy splitting between the pecs of the @xmath76 and @xmath155 state which will be discussed in the following subsection .",
    "in addition to the deep minimum at @xmath156 in the pec of the @xmath76 state , a second minimum exists which in field free space is very shallow and located at @xmath157 the corresponding region of the pecs is illustrated in fig .",

    "2b we can also observe the monotonous decrease in @xmath161 up to a field strength of @xmath165    next let us discuss the existence of bound states .",
    "herefore we have to investigate whether vibrational levels exist in the pecs discussed above .",
    "the determination of vibrational levels in the presence of a magnetic field is a complicated task since the born - oppenheimer approximation known from field free space breaks down in the presence of a magnetic field : the nuclear charges are treated as naked charges which is an incomplete description since they are at least partially screened by the electrons against the magnetic field . in order to decribe this screening correctly , the diagonal terms of the nonadiabatic coupling elements have to be included in the nuclear equation of motion @xcite .",
    "the screening of the nuclear charges depends not only on the internuclear distance but also on the angle between the internuclear axis and the magnetic field . as a consequence",
    "the nuclear equation of motion is much more complex in the presence of a magnetic field compared to the field free space . in the present investigation we are dealing with the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic field axes and therefore can not determine the exact vibrational levels .",
    "however we are able to provide estimations for the positions of the vibrational levels and on the basis of these estimates we can decide whether bound states exist with respect to the vibrational mode r.    a lower estimate of the vibrational energy can be obtained by solving the nuclear equation of motion known from field free space @xmath166 , where the potential @xmath167 is given by the corresponding pec in the magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding schrdinger equation is then solved by using a discrete variable method @xcite .",
    "an upper estimate for the energy of a vibrational state is obtained by simply adding the landau energy of the nuclear equation of motion to the lower estimate of the energy level .",
    "estimations concerning the existence of vibrational levels were performed for each pec shown in all figures .",
    "the number of vibrational levels with quantum number @xmath168 in the first well of the pec of the @xmath76 state ( see fig .",

    "the number of vibrational levels for the first well , which is about @xmath233 in field free space , remains of the same order of magnitude for arbitrary field strengths @xmath2 for the second minimum occuring at a field strength of @xmath18 , the lower estimate of the vibrational energy is located inside the well while the upper estimate lies above and we therefore can not decide whether it accomodates a vibrationally bound state .",
    "the ground state of the hydrogen molecule in field free space is the @xmath234 singlet state . in the presence of a magnetic field ,",
    "the diamagnetic term in the hamiltonian ( [ form1 ] ) causes an increase in the total energy with increasing field strength . at the same time , due to the interaction of the total electronic spin with the magnetic field , the spin - zeeman shift occuring for triplet states with @xmath1 lowers the total energy . as a result",
    "the @xmath5 singlet state is not expected to remain the global ground state of the parallel configuration for sufficiently strong fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite the crossing between the pecs of the singlet @xmath5 and triplet @xmath6 state was determined to occur between @xmath24 and @xmath25 for @xmath26 the pec of the @xmath6 state is lower in energy than that of the @xmath5 state and therefore represents the global ground state of the @xmath15 molecule for a certain range of field strengths ( see below ) . since the pec of the @xmath6 state is , apart from a very shallow van der waals minimum , a purely repulsive curve the hydrogen molecule is unstable ( unbound ) in the corresponding regime of field strengths .",
    "for much higher field strengths ( @xmath27 ) it has been shown @xcite that the ground state of the parallel configuration is the @xmath7 state .",
    "the field strength belonging to the @xmath235 crossing is however not yet known .    in the following we determine and discuss the crossings among the above - mentioned three states as a function of the field strength . in figs . 7a and 7b we show the total energies at the corresponding equilibrium internuclear distances of the @xmath5 and @xmath7 state as well as the total energy in the dissociation limit of the @xmath6 state as a function of the field strength .",
    "first we focus on the crossings of the @xmath5 with the @xmath6 and @xmath7 states which is illustrated in fig .",
    "the transition between the @xmath5 and @xmath6 state occurs at a field strength of approximately @xmath236 and the crossing field strength between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 state is determined to be at @xmath237 with further increasing magnetic field strength the total energy of the @xmath5 state increases strongly and in particular the total energy of the @xmath7 state decreases more rapidly than that of the @xmath6 state .",
    "therefore , a transition occurs between the two latter states which is illustrated in fig .",
    "7b . as can be seen from fig .",
    "7b , the transition field strength occurs to be at @xmath11    in conclusion we encounter the following situation for the @xmath15 molecule oriented parallel to a magnetic field : for @xmath8 the ground state is the strongly bound @xmath5 state . for an intermediate range of field strengths ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath238 , the ground state is the unbound @xmath6 state .",
    "this state exhibits only a very shallow minimum which does not provide any vibrational level @xcite .",
    "therefore the ground state of the parallel configuration is not bound in the regime @xmath238 this result is of great importance for astrophysics in order to decide whether hydrogen molecules exist in the vicinity of white dwarfs . for magnetic fields @xmath13 the ground state is again a strongly bound , namely the @xmath7 state and molecular hydrogen may exist in the vicinity of astrophysical objects which exhibit such huge magnetic field strengths .",
    "in the present investigation we studied the electronic structure of the hydrogen molecule subjected to an external magnetic field which is oriented parallel to the internuclear axis .",
    "we hereby focused on the lowest electronic states of the @xmath0 subspace , i.e. the lowest states with molecular magnetic quantum number equal to one .",
    "we discussed our basis set of nonorthogonal nonspherical gaussian orbitals and briefly described the theoretical aspects of our ci calculations .",
    "first of all we discussed the general properties of the lowest @xmath0 states in field free space and compared our results with the existing data in the literature .",
    "our results show an overall relative accuracy better than @xmath239 at the equilibrium internuclear distances of the pecs and even further improves with increasing internuclear distance .",
    "compared to the results obtained for the lowest @xmath17 states in field free space @xcite , we approximately improved the accuracy in the energy by one order of magnitude .",
    "this is most probably due to the smaller portion of correlation energy for the @xmath0 states .",
    "next we considered the lowest @xmath0 states in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "for the @xmath76 state we observed a monotonous decrease in the dissociation energy with increasing field strength up to @xmath175 and a simultaneous minor increase in the equilibrium internuclear distance . at the same time the position of the occuring maximum",
    "was shifted to smaller values of the internuclear distance . for a field strength of @xmath25 a metastable state with respect to the dissociation into two hydrogen atoms",
    "exists in the pec and for @xmath141 both the minimum and the maximum disappear . for the second , i.e. outer minimum the dissociation energy first increases up to @xmath240 and than decreases with further increasing field strength . in order to decide whether vibrationally bound states exist in the discussed pecs we determined upper and lower estimates for the vibrational energies .",
    "up to a field strength of @xmath175 the @xmath76 state was shown to accomodate a few vibrational levels .",
    "for the second well vibrationally bound states exist in the range @xmath241 for @xmath171 the existence of bound states depends on the detailed nuclear dynamics of the molecule . for even larger field strengths",
    "no vibrational levels were found .    for the pec of the @xmath77 state we observe a decrease in the dissociation energy and a simultaneous increase in the equilibrium internuclear distance with increasing field strength in the regime @xmath242 metastable states with respect to the dissociation into two h atoms",
    "were shown to exist for the range @xmath243 for the position of the maximum in the pec we observed a monotonous decrease with increasing field strength .",
    "for @xmath181 the maximum and the minimum disappear .",
    "we also studied the singlet - triplet energy splitting between the @xmath76 and @xmath244 state as a function of the magnetic field strength .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the corresponding pecs in field free space are almost indistinguishable for sufficiently small internuclear distances .",
    "we hereby focused on the rough shape of the pecs and neglected the properties due to the very shallow second minimum occuring in the pec of the @xmath76 state . in the presence of a magnetic field and",
    "with increasing field strength we found an increase of the splitting between these two states for small internuclear distances , i.e. for the region , where the corresponding pecs are almost identical in field free space . for larger internuclear distances we found a significant difference between the pecs of the @xmath76 and @xmath245 state for @xmath246 for this regime of field strengths the pec of the @xmath77 state exhibits no extrema but two turning points which do not exist in the corresponding pec of the @xmath76 state .",
    "the maximum of the absolute value of the splitting was found to occur at a field strength of approximately @xmath195 vibrationally bound states were shown to exist up to @xmath3    for the pec of the @xmath92 state we first observe a decrease in the dissociation energy up to a field strength of @xmath247 with increasing field strength and subsequently a strong increase in the dissociation energy with further increasing field strength . at the same time",
    "the equilibrium internuclear distance decreases monotonously . for the number of vibrational levels we found a minor increase by a few levels compared to the number of levels in field free space .",
    "next we studied the pec of the @xmath7 state in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "the dissociation energy and the equilibrium internuclear distance remain nearly constant for small values of b , i.e. for @xmath242 with further increasing field strength we observe a strong increase in the dissociation energy .",
    "an interesting phenomenon is the existence of an additional minimum and a maximum for a field strength regime around @xmath18 despite the shallowness of the corresponding well it may accomodate a vibrationally bound state .",
    "for the first , i.e. well - pronounced well vibrational states exist for all field strengths @xmath2    finally we investigated the important transitions occuring among the @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 states .",
    "it was shown recently @xcite that the strongly bound @xmath5 state is the global ground state of the hydrogen molecule for @xmath8 and that the global ground state beyond @xmath236 is the unbound @xmath6 state up to some unknown critical field strength @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath6 state exhibits a purely repulsive pec apart from a shallow van der waal minimum which does not provide any vibrational level .",
    "an important result of the present investigation is that at approximately @xmath248 the ground state changes from the @xmath6 state to the strongly bound @xmath7 state .",
    "this is of great importance for the chemistry in the atmosphere of certain degenerate astrophysical objects : it may help to decide whether molecular hydrogen can exist in the vicinity of white dwarfs .",
    "we emphasize that the present investigation was performed for the case of parallel internuclear and magnetic field axes . in order to draw a definite conclusion concerning the ground state of the @xmath15 molecule",
    "the electronic structure has to be investigated for arbitrary angles between the molecule and the magnetic field .",
    "the above results may also give rise to an experimental scenario .",
    "let us consider configurations with an angle in the range @xmath249 , i.e. the internuclear axis is inclined with respect to the magnetic field . since the electronic potential energy depends on both the internuclear distance @xmath39 as well as the angle @xmath250 we are dealing with two dimensional potential energy surfaces .",
    "the only remaining symmetry for such configurations for a homonuclear diatomic molecule is the parity , i.e. the corresponding molecular symmetry group is @xmath251 .",
    "we now briefly address the question whether different electronic states may interact strongly through the nuclear motion .",
    "this problem was investigated in some detail in ref .",
    "it was shown that for a homonuclear diatomic molecule a two dimensional avoided crossing occurs for electronic states with the same spatial symmetry and in particular that _ conical intersections _ can occur at @xmath252 or @xmath253 for crossings of states with the same parity .",
    "for @xmath254 we expect a crossing without interaction between the lowest state with gerade and the lowest state with ungerade parity .",
    "more interestingly we expect a conical intersection to occur at @xmath255 for the pecs of the two lowest states @xmath256 with ungerade parity .",
    "the hydrogen molecule in the presence of a magnetic field therefore is an example for a simple system for which the _ ground state _ in strong fields exhibits a _",
    "conical intersection_. from an experimental point of view we are hereby not restricted to the case of static external magnetic fields but could also use pulsed fields .",
    "the time scale of the pulse is usually orders of magnitude larger than the time scale of the nuclear motion near a conical intersection . for the case of the hydrogen molecule ,",
    "the field strength at which a conical intersection of the lowest states with ungerade parity may be observed , is @xmath192 which corresponds to a few ten thousand tesla .",
    "pulsed magnetic fields of that strength may be reachable in the laboratory in the nearer future .",
