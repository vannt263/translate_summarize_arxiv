    "one of the most promising methods for quantum information processing is linear optics and photodetection .",
    "linear optics and photodetection may be used for provably secure quantum communication @xcite , as well as quantum computation @xcite .",
    "an important requirement for these schemes is the ability to produce a single photon on demand @xcite , yet generating high - fidelity single - photon states is challenging .",
    "the traditional method for generating single photons involves photodetection on one output mode from a non - degenerate parametric down - conversion process to post - select a single photon in the correlated mode @xcite .",
    "this method has the drawback that the time of the photon emission is not controlled .",
    "more recently , triggered photon sources have been developed , including molecules @xcite , quantum wells @xcite , colour centers @xcite , ions @xcite and quantum dots @xcite .",
    "these sources have a significant vacuum contribution , but the multiphoton contribution may be made very small @xcite .",
    "for the majority of this study , we approximate these sources by taking the multiphoton probability to be zero . that is , we consider an idealised single - mode single - photon source , which may be represented by the density operator @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the probability for a single photon , and is also called the efficiency . increasing",
    "the efficiency is important because many quantum optics experiments , especially those concerned with linear optical quantum computation , require high efficiency sources .",
    "we also derive results for states with a coherent superposition of the vacuum and a single photon ; however , this form of state is not produced by single - photon sources .",
    "much effort is directed towards improving sources , but here we pose the question as to whether it is possible to perform post - processing to obtain higher efficiency .",
    "ideally this post - processing should also maintain a zero multiphoton contribution ( though a very small multiphoton contribution would also be acceptable ) .",
    "a promising method of post - processing is linear optics and photodetection .",
    "as mentioned above , linear optics and photodetection can be used to perform quantum computation @xcite , and optical controlled - not gates have recently been demonstrated @xcite ; however , there are also no - go theorems for linear optics @xcite .    in a recent publication @xcite we investigated the possibility of improving the single - photon efficiency @xmath1 with linear optical elements and photodetection . here",
    "we present a number of new results that clarify the limitations inherent in this method , as well as reviewing the results presented in @xcite .",
    "in particular , we analyse the effects of various experimental limitations , present a scheme that gives perfect results for inputs with a coherent superposition of zero and one photon , and show connections between some difficult unsolved problems .",
    "we begin by showing that it is not possible to obtain an improvement for the simple case of a beam splitter in sec .",
    "[ sec : split ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : coherent ] we show that , if we allow a coherent superposition of zero and one photon , rather than an incoherent mixture , it is possible to obtain a perfect single - photon state .",
    "we then proceed to the case of a multimode interferometer with incoherent inputs in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] . in secs .",
    "[ sec : limit ] and [ sec : method ] we give an expanded discussion of the limit on the improvement that it is possible to obtain , and the method to obtain an improvement . sec .",

    "we give further discussion of no - go theorems for post - processing in sec .",
    "[ sec : nogo ] .",
    "then , in sec .  [ sec : conn ] ,",
    "we show that there are deep connections between the unsolved problems for post - processing .",
    "lastly we give a discussion of how the theory is changed by allowing multiphoton contributions in the inputs in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] , and we conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] .",
    "to begin , we consider the simplest case of two copies of the quantum state ( [ eq : initialstate ] ) combined on a single beam splitter .",
    "the initial state can be written in the form @xmath2 each photonic mode operator gets transformed by the beam splitter in the following way : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a @xmath5 unitary matrix @xcite .",
    "we have two options , to project onto the vacuum or onto the single - photon fock state ( projecting onto two photons results in vacuum output in the unmeasured mode ) .",
    "after vacuum projection in mode 2 , we end up with an unnormalised state of the form @xmath6 thus the ratio between the probabilities for one and zero photons is just a weighted average of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and can not exceed either of these .",
    "that is , it is not possible to improve the ratio between the probabilities for obtaining one and zero photons .",
    "this automatically implies that it is not possible to improve the absolute probability of obtaining one photon .    in the case of a single - photon detection , the resulting unnormalised state",
    "is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the permanent @xcite of the beam splitter matrix @xmath4 .",
    "since the absolute value of the permanent of a unitary matrix is bounded from above by unity , and the term in brackets is a weighted sum of terms @xmath11 , we do not find any improvement for this case either .",
    "hence there is no improvement in the probability for a single photon if zero , one or two photons are detected .",
    "these results demonstrate that for mixed - state inputs it is impossible to obtain an improvement in the single - photon probability using a beam splitter .",
    "it is possible to obtain an improvement using a beam splitter if the inputs are in pure - state superpositions of zero and one photon , instead of incoherent mixtures .",
    "consider two input modes that are each in the state @xmath12 .",
    "the initial state may be written as @xmath13 { |{00}\\rangle } .\\ ] ] applying the beam splitter transformation gives @xmath14 + \\beta^2 \\left[\\lambda_{11}\\lambda_{12}(a_1{^\\dagger})^2 + \\lambda_{21}\\lambda_{22 } ( a_2{^\\dagger})^2 + ( { \\text{per}}\\bm{\\lambda } ) a_1{^\\dagger}a_2{^\\dagger}\\right]\\right\\ } { |{00}\\rangle } .\\ ] ] conditioning on detection of zero photons in mode 2 gives the output state @xmath15 it is easily seen that this output state may have a higher probability for a single photon .",
    "for example , if the initial state is close to the vacuum state ( i.e.  @xmath16 ) , then an improvement by a factor of two may be obtained by using @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , it is possible to further process this output state to obtain a perfect single - photon state .",
    "if we combine this state with mode 3 , which is also assumed to be prepared in state @xmath12 , then the total state may be represented as @xmath18 \\left ( \\alpha + \\beta a_3{^\\dagger}\\right ) { |{00}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] applying the beam splitter transformation ( except using a prime to distinguish this beam splitter from the previous one ) gives @xmath19 \\left [ \\alpha + \\beta ( \\lambda'_{13 } \\hat{a}_1{^\\dagger}+\\lambda'_{33 } \\hat{a}_3{^\\dagger } ) \\right ] { |{00}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] conditioning on detection of two photons gives @xmath20{|{0}\\rangle}+\\beta \\lambda_{11}\\lambda_{12}\\left ( 2\\lambda'_{11 } \\lambda'_{33}+\\lambda'_{31}\\lambda'_{13}\\right){|{1}\\rangle } \\right\\}\\ ] ]    to make this equation more clear , we use @xmath21 , \\qquad \\bm{\\lambda } ' = \\left [ \\begin{array}{*{20}c } e^{i\\phi'}\\cos\\theta '   & -\\sin \\theta ' \\\\ \\sin\\theta ' & e^{-i\\phi'}\\cos\\theta '   \\\\ \\end{array } \\right].\\ ] ] the condition that the output state is a pure single - photon state then becomes @xmath22 this equation may be satisfied by taking @xmath23 and @xmath24 to be @xmath25 that is , regardless of the characteristics of the initial beam splitter ( provided @xmath26 and @xmath27 are nonzero ) , it is possible to obtain a perfect single - photon output .",
    "another issue is the probability for obtaining the desired pattern of detection results . using the unnormalised expression for @xmath28 above",
    ", this probability is given by @xmath29 in the second line we have used the expression for @xmath23 . this probability is plotted in fig .  [",
    "fig : probs ] for the range @xmath30 to @xmath31 in @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is periodic with period @xmath31 in these variables ) .",
    "there are four maxima in this range , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the exact values of @xmath33 of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are not obvious from the plot but are straightforward to obtain analytically .",
    "the two maxima @xmath41 and @xmath37 correspond to the same beam splitter , so there are only three maxima that correspond to distinct beam splitters . each of these maxima is exactly the same height , @xmath42     the probability of obtaining the desired detection results as a function of the beam splitter parameters @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the first beam splitter.,width=302 ]    one factor that distinguishes the maxima is the sensitivity to the parameters .",
    "clearly the maxima at @xmath36 and @xmath38 are far more sensitive to the values of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , and it is therefore better to use the beam splitter corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath37 . for the second beam splitter ,",
    "the appropriate parameters are @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "that is , the best result is obtained by using a @xmath45 beam splitter followed by a beam splitter with a reflectivity of @xmath46 .",
    "thus we see that , if the inputs to an interferometer are in pure superposition states , it is possible to obtain a perfect single - photon output for three modes . in contrast , if the inputs to the interferometer are incoherent superpositions of fock states , it is impossible to obtain an improvement in the single - photon probability for three modes @xcite .",
    "these results imply that it is the incoherence in the inputs that prevents an improvement in the single photon probability .",
    "it would be interesting to determine the degree of decoherence that is sufficient to prevent an improvement in the single - photon efficiency .",
    "however , this is a difficult problem , which we leave to further investigation .",
    "although it is possible to obtain perfect single - photon states from pure superposition states , this method can not be applied to current experiments , as single - photon sources do not produce pure superposition states .",
    "real single - photon sources produce an incoherent combination of fock states ; therefore we consider input states of this form for the remainder of this paper . in the multimode case",
    "we start with a supply of @xmath47 mixed states of the form . for additional generality",
    "we allow the different inputs to have different probabilities for a single photon , @xmath48 , and we denote the maximum of these probabilities by @xmath49 .",
    "the initial input state may be described by @xmath50 { \\nonumber}\\\\     & = \\sum_{\\bm{s } } p_{\\bm{s } } \\left ( \\prod_i ( \\hat a_i{^\\dagger})^{s_i } { |{0}\\rangle}{\\langle{0}| } \\prod_i ( \\hat a_i)^{s_i}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 , and the vector @xmath52 @xmath53 @xmath54 , ( @xmath55 ) , gives the photon numbers in the inputs .",
    "the quantity @xmath56 is the probability of obtaining this combination of input photon numbers .",
    "schematic setup of the network .",
    "we assume @xmath47 incoming modes prepared in the state with different @xmath48 . the photon number is measured in output modes 2 to @xmath47 , and we wish to improve the probability for a single photon in mode 1.,width=166 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -55.5,3)@xmath57 ( -32.1,3)@xmath58 ( 0,3)@xmath59 ( 37.8,3)@xmath60 ( -56,142)@xmath61 ( -32,142)@xmath62 ( 0,142)@xmath59 ( 35,142)@xmath63 ( -15,68.5)u@xmath64    this input is then passed through a passive interferometer which consists of beam splitters , mirrors , and phase shifters .",
    "each of these elements preserves total photon number from input to output under ideal conditions .",
    "no energy is required to operate these optical elements , hence the term passive ( also known as linear optical elements ) .",
    "more generally , polarisation transforming elements can be included , but here we are concerned only with a scalar field treatment ; in fact polarisation effects could be included by doubling the number of channels and treating the two polarisations in a mode as two separate channels .",
    "classically the field amplitude of channel @xmath65 would be represented by the complex number @xmath66 .",
    "the set of all field amplitudes for the @xmath47-channel interferometer is given by the vector @xmath67 .",
    "the passive interferometer transforms the input amplitudes to the output amplitudes via the matrix transformation @xmath68 with @xmath69 , where u@xmath64 is the set of all @xmath70 unitary matrices .",
    "quantisation of the field is obtained by the replacement of @xmath71 by the vector annihilation operator @xmath72 , and the interferometer transforms the operators according to @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "this transformation of the operators yields @xmath74.\\ ] ]    in the completely general case , we could perform photodetections on @xmath75 of the modes , and use the remaining @xmath76 modes as single - photon sources if the desired combination of detection results is obtained .",
    "however , this generality is not needed here because we are concerned with the maximum improvement in the photon statistics in a single mode . in order to fix notation",
    ", we denote as mode 1 that mode for which we want to improve the statistics , and label the other modes where photodetections have not been performed as modes 2 to @xmath76 .",
    "the reduced density matrix in mode 1 is then identical to what would be obtained if photodetections were performed on modes 2 to @xmath76 ( as well as @xmath77 to @xmath47 ) , and the results of these photodetections discarded .",
    "therefore , the probability for a single photon will be a weighted average of the single - photon probabilities for the different combinations of detections in modes 2 to @xmath76 . hence the maximum single - photon probability in mode 1 will be obtained for some combination of detections in modes 2 to @xmath76 .",
    "for this reason we consider the state in mode 1 conditioned on photodetections in the other @xmath78 modes . as our aim is to determine the best results possible using linear optics and photodetection , we also assume that the photodetectors perform perfect photon counting measurements ( imperfect detection is discussed later ) .    before determining the conditional output state ,",
    "we introduce some additional notation .",
    "the total number of photons detected is @xmath79 , and the maximum possible number of photons input to the interferometer is @xmath80 . as some of the @xmath48 may be equal to zero",
    ", @xmath80 may be less than @xmath47 ; @xmath80 is equal to the number of nonzero values of @xmath48 . for @xmath81",
    ", @xmath82 is the number of photons detected in mode @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is the photon number in mode 1 ( the output mode ) .",
    "we use the notation @xmath85 ( so @xmath86 ) and @xmath87 .",
    "in addition , we define the set @xmath88 , and let @xmath89 be the set that consists of all vectors comprised of the elements of @xmath90 .",
    "the conditional state in mode 1 after photodetection in modes 2 to @xmath47 is @xmath91 each coefficient @xmath92 is given by @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a tensor product of number states in each of the output modes and the normalisation constant @xmath95 is equal to @xmath96^{-1}.\\ ] ] evaluating @xmath92 gives @xmath97 where @xmath98 , and @xmath99 this quantity may alternatively be expressed using permanents as @xmath100).\\ ] ] here the notation @xmath101 $ ] is used to indicate that the @xmath65th column of @xmath4 is repeated @xmath102 times , and the @xmath83th row is repeated @xmath82 times .",
    "two figures of merit for an arbitrary single mode field @xmath103 are @xmath104 we use the subscript `` out '' to indicate the output field , and `` in '' to indicate the input field . for the output field",
    "we simply have @xmath105 . for the input field , we have @xmath106 , as the two - photon component is assumed be negligible . for simplicity we define @xmath107 to be the maximum input ratio @xmath108 .",
    "the figure of merit @xmath109 characterises the two - photon contribution , and is equal to @xmath110 for poisson photon statistics . if the multiphoton component in the output is zero , then comparing @xmath107 and @xmath111 immediately tells us if there is an improvement in the probability for a single photon .",
    "even if the multiphoton component is nonzero , using @xmath111 has the advantages : + 1 .",
    "the common constant @xmath112 cancels , so it is possible to evaluate @xmath111 analytically .",
    "if @xmath113 , then it is clear that @xmath114 .",
    "thus we can determine those cases where there is _ no _ improvement .",
    "+ 3 . for @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "therefore the improvement in @xmath118 is approximately the same as the improvement in the single - photon probability over @xmath49 .",
    "an alternative measure of the multiphoton contributions is given by how sub - poissonian the field is .",
    "that is , we may define the measure @xmath119 for a sub - poissonian field , @xmath120 .",
    "states of the form are sub - poissonian , with @xmath121 .",
    "we take @xmath122 to be the minimum value in the inputs , @xmath123 , and @xmath124 is simply the value for the output mode .",
    "if an output @xmath125 greater than @xmath49 is obtained , while maintaining a multiphoton contribution that is zero or very small , then it is clear that @xmath124 will be smaller than @xmath122 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the output has multiphoton contributions similar to those for a poisson distribution , @xmath124 will be closer to 1 .",
    "ideally we wish to obtain an improvement in the figure of merit @xmath118 , while maintaining a value of @xmath109 that is zero , or at least small with respect to @xmath110 ( the value for a poisson distribution ) .",
    "this is a difficult task , so for simplicity we begin by focusing on improving @xmath118 . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is an upper limit on how far @xmath118 can be increased .",
    "here we show this result in more detail .",
    "first we consider the expression for @xmath126 : @xmath127 here @xmath128 and @xmath129 is the combination of detection results for @xmath81 . a simple way of re - expressing this summation is @xmath130 where @xmath131 except for @xmath132 .",
    "that is , we consider combinations of input photons @xmath52 with one too many photons , then remove one of these photons to obtain the correct number of input photons .",
    "this expression for the sum gives each term @xmath133 times , so it is necessary to divide by @xmath133 to obtain the correct result .",
    "specifically , each alternative @xmath134 may be obtained from an @xmath52 which is identical , except one of the zeros of @xmath134 is replaced with a one .",
    "as each @xmath134 has @xmath133 zeros , there are @xmath133 possible alternative @xmath52 that give the same @xmath134 .",
    "if some of the inputs to the interferometer are simply vacuum states ( i.e.  some of the @xmath48 are zero ) , it is possible to express the summation in a more efficient way .",
    "first note that those terms in the sum in eq .",
    "with @xmath135 do not contribute to the sum ; therefore we may restrict to terms with @xmath136 .",
    "@xmath137 we may re - express this equation as @xmath138 where @xmath139 . here the dividing factor required is only @xmath140 .",
    "recall that the maximum total number of photons is @xmath80 , so there are @xmath141 inputs with @xmath142 .",
    "each alternative @xmath134 still has @xmath133 zeros , but some of these zeros will correspond to inputs with @xmath142 . because we are restricting to terms with @xmath136 ,",
    "for all @xmath65 with @xmath142 , @xmath143 and therefore @xmath144 must be equal to zero .",
    "thus all @xmath141 of the inputs with @xmath142 must correspond to zeros of @xmath134 , and so there will only be @xmath140 zeros of @xmath134 that correspond to nonzero @xmath48 . as in the previous case",
    ", each @xmath134 may be obtained from an @xmath52 which is identical , except one of the zeros of @xmath134 is replaced with a one .",
    "however , because we have restricted to terms with @xmath136 , the zero that is replaced with a one must be for an @xmath65 with nonzero @xmath48 .",
    "hence there are only @xmath140 alternative @xmath52 that lead to the same @xmath134 , and the redundancy in this case is only @xmath140 . that is why a dividing factor of @xmath140 is required in this case .    simplifying eq .  , we obtain @xmath145 because the sum is limited to terms where @xmath146 , @xmath147 is nonzero , and therefore the ratio @xmath148 does not diverge . using @xmath149",
    ", we obtain the inequality @xmath150 we now allow terms with @xmath135 , because they do not contribute to the sum .",
    "it is also possible to obtain an inequality for @xmath125 .",
    "the probability @xmath125 is given by @xmath151 in this case the notation @xmath152 means @xmath153 , and @xmath154 is the combination of detection results for @xmath81 .",
    "we may express @xmath155 as @xmath156 therefore , we may re - express the equation for @xmath125 as @xmath157 this then gives the inequality @xmath158    combining eqs .   and , we can see that @xmath159 this yields an upper limit on the ratio between the probabilities for one and zero photons .",
    "this result allows one to draw three main conclusions : + 1 . as @xmath160 and @xmath161 , the improvement in @xmath118 can never be greater than @xmath47 .",
    "there is no known scheme that saturates this upper bound , but there is a scheme known that achieves an improvement of approximately @xmath162 @xcite .",
    "if the number of photons detected is one less than the maximum input number , then @xmath163 , and there can not be an improvement ( personal communication ) . ] .",
    "this case is important because it is the most straightforward way of eliminating the possibility of two or more photons in the output mode .",
    "we have not proven that it is impossible to obtain an improvement while eliminating the multiphoton component , but if such a scheme is possible it can not eliminate the multiphoton component by detecting one less than the maximum input number of photons .",
    "it is impossible to obtain a single photon with unit probability if @xmath164 .",
    "if @xmath165 were obtained , then @xmath111 would be infinite ; from eq .",
    ", this is clearly not possible unless @xmath107 is infinite ( which would correspond to @xmath166 ) .",
    "we have previously shown that it is possible to obtain an improvement in the probability for a single photon @xcite . here",
    "we review this method , giving more motivation for this scheme and propose a simple realisation using a line of beam splitters . in order to obtain a value for the ratio @xmath111 that is close to the upper limit , we require the two inequalities and to be as close to equality as possible",
    ". we may achieve equality in the first case by taking all nonzero @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 .    to obtain equality in eq .",
    ", we would require @xmath167 whenever @xmath168 is nonzero , and @xmath169 to be proportional to @xmath170 for those values of @xmath171 where @xmath167 .",

    "the first condition is a problem , because it can not be satisfied unless @xmath172 . to see this , note that this condition is equivalent to requiring that @xmath173 implies @xmath174 , for all @xmath52 that give @xmath175 . if @xmath175 , then @xmath173 for all @xmath171 such that @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , @xmath176 implies @xmath174 .",
    "now if @xmath177 , then it must be the case that @xmath173 for some @xmath171 such that @xmath178 .",
    "in addition , for arbitrary @xmath171 , there will be an @xmath52 with @xmath175 such that @xmath173 and @xmath178 .",
    "therefore , for the first condition to be satisfied , it would be necessary for @xmath168 to be equal to zero for all @xmath171 .",
    "this is clearly not possible , because @xmath4 is a unitary matrix .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath179 , then the only @xmath52 giving @xmath175 is that with @xmath167 for @xmath178 , and @xmath173 for @xmath176 .",
    "therefore , it is possible for the first condition to be satisfied , by choosing a @xmath4 with @xmath174 for all @xmath171 such that @xmath176 .",
    "however , the case with @xmath172 is unimportant , because it is not possible to obtain an improvement in @xmath118 .",
    "hence we see that , in any case where it is possible to obtain an improvement , it is not possible to obtain equality in eq .  .    on the other hand , we can determine a scheme that gives @xmath180 .",
    "this condition can be satisfied using the interferometer with matrix elements @xmath181 for @xmath182 ( the values of @xmath183 for @xmath184 do not enter into the analysis ) . here",

    "the probability of a single photon increases approximately as @xmath162 , but does not achieve the upper bound of @xmath47 .",
    "although we find an improvement in the measure @xmath118 , the two - photon contribution is not negligible .",
    "using the measure @xmath109 , we find @xmath223 for @xmath218 , this measure is close to @xmath110 , so the two - photon component is similar to that for a poisson distribution . by taking @xmath224 ,",
    "it is possible to obtain an improvement in @xmath118 of about a factor of two , with a value of @xmath225 about half that for a poisson distribution .",
    "however , this two - photon contribution is still much greater than for good single - photon sources @xcite .",
    "the multiphoton contributions are especially important for larger @xmath49 .",
    "although the improvement in @xmath118 is independent of @xmath49 , the multiphoton component means that improvements in @xmath125 are obtained only for values of @xmath49 below @xmath110 .",
    "that is , this method can only be used to obtain improvements in the probability of a single photon up to @xmath110 , but not to make the probability of a single photon arbitrarily close to 1 .",

    "it is more difficult to evaluate this scheme using this measure , and we do not have a simple solution for @xmath226 . however , numerically we find that @xmath124 is close to 1 for @xmath218 , again indicating that the output state is close to poissonian . for @xmath224 ,",
    "@xmath124 is closer to @xmath122 ( @xmath227 ) , but for no @xmath79 is a value of @xmath124 less than @xmath122 obtained .",

    "it can be expected that this improvement is close to the maximum possible , because this scheme satisfies @xmath180 .",

    "as shown above , this condition can not be satisfied completely ( unless there is no improvement in @xmath118 ) , and there does not appear to be any method of satisfying it better than the method we have described above .",
    "extensive numerical searches have failed to find any scheme that gives a better improvement in @xmath118 than the above scheme , strongly indicating that it is optimal for increasing @xmath118 .",
    "in practice , there will be a number of limitations to using this method for improving the probability of a single photon .",
    "the main ones are : + 1 . real photodetectors do not give perfect photon counting measurements .",
    "most photodetectors can only distinguish between the vacuum state and a state with one or more photons .",
    "real photodetectors have limited efficiency and dark counts .",
    "the desired combination of detection results will occur with low probability .",
    "real sources will have a finite multiphoton component . + for @xmath187 of the detectors , point 1 will not be a problem .",
    "the reason for this is that we are conditioning on detection of zero photons at these detectors .",
    "it is only the detector on mode 2 that is required to perform a photon counting measurement . even for this detector",
    ", it is not necessary to determine the exact photon number .",
    "that is because the probability of a single photon will be increased for any number of photons detected from 2 to @xmath187 .",
    "therefore , if the detector can register that the photon number is in this range , rather than the exact photon number , it will be sufficient to produce an improvement in the single - photon probability .",
    "alternatively , an improvement can also be achieved using detection that simply verifies that there is more than one photon .",
    "for example , the visible light photon counter @xcite can do this task with high efficiency . even though the possibilities of @xmath78 or @xmath47 photons have not been eliminated , they have lower probability , and will not contribute significantly to the photon probabilities .",
    "limited efficiency is not a severe problem for small @xmath49 , because the probability for the vacuum is relatively large .",
    "dark counts will not be a problem for the first @xmath187 detectors , because we are conditioning on vacuum detection at these detectors .",
    "dark counts will merely slightly reduce the probability of obtaining the desired combination of detection results .",
    "on the other hand , dark counts will be a problem for detector 2 , as we are conditioning on detection of more than one photon at this detector .",
    "point 3 will always be a problem , because the above scheme is only effective for small @xmath185 .",
    "the probability for this combination of detection results becomes very small in the limit of small @xmath185 .",
    "if larger values of @xmath185 are used , then the final probability for a single photon becomes smaller .",
    "thus there is a trade - off involved .",
    "point 4 is more complicated , and it is not clear how important this problem is without performing direct calculations .     the final probability for a single photon versus the probability for obtaining the appropriate detection results for a four mode interferometer and @xmath229 .",
    "the black line is the ideal case , the light blue line is that for the case where detection results of @xmath230 and @xmath231 are also allowed , the green line is that if , in addition , the photodetectors have 90% efficiency .",
    "the dark blue line is that including all of these experimental limitations , plus 0.1% chance of dark counts at detector 2 , and the red line is that taking into account these experimental limitations , as well as allowing 0.1% probability for two photons in the inputs ( without dark counts).,width=302 ]    to estimate the relative importance of each of the above problems , we have calculated the final conditional probability for a single photon successively taking each of the above issues into account . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp ] , we have plotted the conditional probability for a single photon versus the probability for obtaining the desired combination of detection results .",
    "these curves are parametrised by @xmath185 ; that is , both probabilities were calculated for a range of values of @xmath185 . in general ,",
    "as @xmath185 is decreased , the probability for obtaining the desired detection results decreases , and the final conditional probability for a single photon increases .",
    "the particular example we have shown is of a 4 mode interferometer where @xmath229 for the inputs .    to perform these calculations ,",
    "the density matrix was left unnormalised .",
    "the trace of the density matrix at the end of the calculation then gives the probability for that combination of detection results .",
    "for those cases where two , three and four photons were not distinguished , the density matrices for these three cases were simply added . to take account of finite efficiency detectors and dark counts , the density matrices for the other detection results",
    "were multiplied by constant factors , and added to the density matrix for the desired detection result .",
    "it was assumed that the inefficient detectors register single - photon , two - photon and three - photon states as vacuum with probabilities of 10% , 1% and 0.1% , respectively .",
    "for the detector on mode 2 it was assumed that a single - photon state is registered as two or more photons with 0.1% probability , and the vacuum state is registered as two or more photons with 0.0001% probability ( due to the lower probability of simultaneous dark counts ) .",
    "the appropriate equations to use for the case with multiphoton inputs are derived in sec .",
    "[ sec : multi ] .    for perfect sources and detectors ,",
    "the final probability for a single photon is above the initial probability of 20% when the probability for obtaining the detection results is below about 0.7% .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the desired detection results , the experiment needs to be repeated roughly 200 times , which is not unreasonable . if we consider a final detector that can not distinguish between two , three or four photons , the results are almost identical , so this problem is relatively trivial .",
    "even photodetectors with finite efficiency do not greatly affect the results .",
    "if the first two photodetectors have 90% efficiency , the final probability for a single photon is reduced by about 0.3% .",
    "the greatest problems are dark counts at detector 2 , and multiphoton components at the inputs .",
    "if a dark count rate of 0.1% is allowed , then the maximum single - photon probability is reduced below 0.23% . for small values of @xmath185",
    "the single - photon probability drops dramatically , rather than approaching the maximum value .",
    "the results are similar if a two - photon probability of 0.1% is allowed in the inputs ( while the vacuum probability is decreased by 0.1% ) .",
    "the single - photon probability again drops for small values of @xmath185 , and the maximum single - photon probability is less than 0.22% . for two - photon probabilities of 0.4% or more",
    "it is not possible to obtain any increase in the single - photon probability .",
    "thus we see that the main problems with experimental realisations will be two - photon components in the input and dark counts at detector 2 .",
    "in this section , we prove a number of no - go theorems for post - processing via linear optics and photodetection .",
    "note that one limitation of the scheme given in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] is that it only gives improvements in @xmath118 for four or modes .",
    "in fact , it is impossible to obtain improvements for fewer than four modes @xcite .",
    "this result may be shown in the following way .",
    "first consider the case @xmath232 .",
    "then there is only one term in the sum for @xmath126 , and @xmath233 .",
    "the expression for @xmath125 becomes @xmath234 thus we have shown that @xmath235 , so @xmath236 . hence there can be no improvement in the photon statistics if zero photons are detected .",
    "a u(@xmath47 ) interferometer can be represented by a u(@xmath78 ) interferometer preceded by @xmath78 beam splitters .",
    "this figure shows the example for @xmath237.,width=166 ]    ( 0,0 ) ( -65.5,3)@xmath57 ( -39.8,3)@xmath58 ( 0,3)@xmath59 ( 36.8,3)@xmath60 ( -67,156)@xmath61 ( -39,155)@xmath30 ( 0,155)@xmath59 ( 37.5,155)@xmath30 ( -15,108)u@xmath238    this result can also be shown in a more intuitive way as follows .",
    "first note that an arbitrary u(@xmath47 ) interferometer can be obtained using a line of @xmath78 beam splitters followed by a u(@xmath78 ) interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : line ] ) .",
    "this is an immediate consequence of the algorithmic construction of arbitrary u(@xmath47 ) interferometers from beam splitters @xcite .",
    "if the @xmath78 modes upon which the u(@xmath78 ) interferometer acts are those that are measured , then we may omit the u(@xmath78 ) interferometer entirely ( because detecting zero photons at the output of this interferometer is identical to detecting zero photons at the input ) .",
    "thus this case may be reduced to the case of a line of beam splitters where zero photons are detected at each stage .",
    "the case of a line of beam splitters with vacuum detection may be deduced from the case for a single beam splitter . as was shown above , with a single beam splitter",
    "there is no improvement in the ratio between the probabilities for detecting one and zero photons .",
    "it is easily seen that the same result holds if there are nonzero probabilities for photon numbers larger than 1 in the inputs ( corresponding to photon numbers larger than one in the output ) .",
    "thus , if we have a line of beam splitters , the ratio between the probabilities for one and zero photons in the output can not be increased above the maximum of that for the inputs .",
    "this result implies that the probability of one photon in the output can never exceed @xmath49 .",
    "this result holds for a line of beam splitters , and therefore for an arbitrary u(@xmath47 ) interferometer .",
    "we can also obtain a similar result for the case @xmath239 , provided all the input @xmath48 are equal . if the single photon is detected in mode @xmath240 , then @xmath241 the value of @xmath125 is given by @xmath242 { \\nonumber}\\\\ & = \\frac 12 k ' r_{\\rm in}^2 p_{\\bm{0 } } \\left [ \\sum_l      \\lambda_{1k}^ * + \\sum_l \\lambda_{1l}^*\\lambda_{ml }   \\sum_k \\lambda_{mk}^ * \\lambda_{1k}\\right ] { \\nonumber}\\\\ & = k ' r_{\\rm in}^2 p_{\\bm{0}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the last line we have used the fact that @xmath168 and @xmath243 are orthonormal .",
    "thus we again find @xmath113 , so @xmath236 .",
    "these results can be used for an alternative proof that no improvement is possible for the case of a single beam splitter .",
    "we have shown that detecting zero photons does not give an improvement , and if one photon is detected , then we must have @xmath163 or 0 , so there again can be no improvement .",
    "we can also eliminate the case of a three - mode interferometer , though the reasoning is not as straightforward .",
    "first note that an input with probability @xmath48 of a photon can be obtained by randomly selecting between a source with efficiency @xmath49 and the vacuum .",
    "that is , with probability @xmath244 we use the source with efficiency @xmath49 , and with probability @xmath245 we use the vacuum state .",
    "if we discard the information about which source was used , this is obviously equivalent to a source with efficiency @xmath48 .",
    "hence the value of @xmath125 for the source with efficiency @xmath48 is the weighted average of the values of @xmath125 for the cases where the efficiency is @xmath49 and zero .",
    "thus the maximum @xmath125 must be obtained with all of the nonzero @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , in considering the three - mode interferometer , we can let all the nonzero @xmath48 be equal to @xmath49 .",
    "if all the @xmath48 are nonzero , then we can use the result showing that there is no improvement with one photon detected and all @xmath48 equal .",
    "the other alternatives for detection have @xmath232 or @xmath246 , so there can be no improvements in these cases either . if one or more of the @xmath48 are zero , then the only detection alternatives are with @xmath232 or @xmath246 .",
    "thus we have shown that there can never be an increase in the probability of a single photon if less than four modes are used .",
    "although it seems that we were able to answer most of the relevant questions concerning the possibility of improving the efficiency of single - photon sources , there are , in fact , still a number of open questions we would now like to address .",
    "the two main unsolved problems for this post - processing are : + 1 .",
    "is it possible to increase the probability for a single photon , regardless of the value of @xmath49 ?",
    "+ 2 . can the single - photon probability be increased without adding a multiphoton component ?",
    "+ at this time the indications are that the answer to both these questions is no .",
    "we have performed numerical searches for interferometers that give improvements for @xmath247 .",
    "these searches have been unsuccessful , indicating that it is not possible to obtain an improvement for @xmath247 .",
    "we have not been able to prove this assertion ; however , we can show that there are various implications if there is any value of @xmath49 such that it is impossible to obtain an improvement .",
    "first note that it is sufficient to use @xmath186 in the input modes . as discussed above , for a given interferometer the maximum improvement will always be obtained with all of the nonzero @xmath48 equal to @xmath49 .",
    "it is possible to obtain a vacuum state from inputs with efficiency @xmath49 , simply by using a beam splitter and conditioning on detection of two photons at one of the outputs .",
    "therefore , if there is an interferometer that achieves a certain result using inputs with @xmath142 or @xmath49 , there will always be another ( expanded ) interferometer that achieves the same result with @xmath186 .    using this simplification , the expression for @xmath92 simplifies to @xmath248 , where @xmath249 the values of @xmath250 are independent of @xmath49 , and depend only on the interferometer and combination of detection results .",
    "there is an improvement in the probability of a single photon if @xmath251    let @xmath252 be a value of @xmath49 such that there is an improvement in the probability of a single photon , and let the corresponding value of @xmath107 be @xmath253 .",
    "then there exists an interferometer and combination of detection results such that @xmath254 since each of the @xmath255 are positive , and the right - hand side is increasing as a function of @xmath107 , we find that is satisfied for all @xmath256 .",
    "thus we find that , for any value of @xmath49 such that there is an improvement , there is an improvement for all smaller values of @xmath49 . in turn",
    "this result implies that , if there is no improvement for @xmath257 , then there can be no improvement for larger values of @xmath49 .",
    "it is also possible to show that , if it were possible to obtain an improvement with no multiphoton contribution , there would be no value of @xmath49 is nonzero and less than 1 .",
    "these restrictions on @xmath49 are implied in the following text . ]",
    "for which we can not obtain an improvement . to show this , note that zero multiphoton contribution implies that @xmath258 for @xmath259 .",
    "therefore , if this improvement is possible for @xmath257 , then eq .   becomes simply @xmath260 similarly , the condition to obtain an improvement for any other value of @xmath49 is simply @xmath261 , which is automatically satisfied .",
    "in addition , because @xmath258 for @xmath259 , @xmath262 for @xmath259 , for any @xmath49 .    thus , if it is possible to obtain an improvement for some value of @xmath49 while maintaining zero multiphoton contribution , then it will be possible to obtain an improvement for all values of @xmath49 .",
    "in addition , the relative improvement in @xmath118 is independent of @xmath49 . to see this , note that @xmath263 a further implication is that it would be possible to obtain an output state that is arbitrarily close to the pure single - photon state .",
    "as the output from the interferometer has no multiphoton contribution , outputs from @xmath47 of these interferometers may be used as the input to another , thus increasing @xmath118 by a factor of @xmath264 .",
    "further iterations may be used to increase @xmath118 by a factor of @xmath265 to any arbitrary power , thus obtaining a final probability for a single photon that is arbitrarily close to 1 .    at this stage",
    "there is no known scheme that can give an improvement in the probability for a single photon while maintaining zero multiphoton contribution . as shown above ,",
    "if this were possible for any value of @xmath49 , then it would be possible for all values @xmath49 . as increasing the single - photon probability _ without _",
    "maintaining zero multiphoton component is a less difficult problem , if it were possible to obtain an improvement while maintaining zero multiphoton component , for all values @xmath49 there would be an enormous range of schemes that give improvements without the constraint on the multiphoton component .",
    "such a wide range of schemes would be relatively easy to find numerically ; the fact that numerical searches have failed to find any scheme that gives an improvement in the single - photon probability for @xmath266 therefore implies that it is extremely unlikely that there is any scheme that gives an improvement while maintaining zero multiphoton contribution .",
    "nevertheless , these numerical results are not sufficient to rule out this possibility .",
    "the majority of this study is based upon inputs from photon sources that have zero multiphoton contribution .",
    "it is also possible to derive results for inputs with nonzero probabilities for two or more photons , but this case is more difficult . the simplest case is for a beam splitter with multiphoton inputs . let us denote the probability for @xmath240 photons in input mode @xmath65 by @xmath267 .",
    "then the input state may be written as @xmath268 the beam splitter transformation gives @xmath269 expanding in a series and conditioning upon detection of @xmath79 photons gives @xmath270 where @xmath95 is a normalisation constant .",
    "if @xmath95 is omitted , the trace gives the probability for this detection result .",
    "this is the expression used to calculate the numerical results in sec .",
    "[ sec : exp ] .",
    "the transformation for a multimode interferometer is also straightforward to determine . for this case",

    "this result is very similar to the case for inputs with no multiphoton contribution .",
    "the only difference is that values of @xmath102 larger than 1 are now permitted , and there is the additional dividing factor of @xmath278 .",
    "we do not use this result in this paper , but it is a useful general form .",
    "only one of the no - go theorems still applies for the case where multiphoton inputs are allowed . for the case of a beam splitter , the multiphoton contributions in the input give multiphoton contributions in the output .",
    "therefore , if zero photons are detected , there can be no improvement in the ratio between the probability for one photon to the probability for zero photons . in the multimode case where zero photons are detected , it is possible to decompose the interferometer as in fig .",
    "[ fig : line ] , then omit the u@xmath238 interferometer . at each beam splitter in the chain",
    "the ratio between the probabilities for one and zero photons is not increased , so the final ratio can not be above the maximum for the inputs .",
    "nevertheless , the result in this case is not as strong as in the case where the inputs have no multiphoton contribution .",
    "proving that the ratio between the probabilities for one and zero photons has not increased does not prove that the absolute probability for a single photon has not increased .",
    "the problem is that it is possible , in principle , for the multiphoton component to be decreased sufficiently that the probability for a single photon is increased .",
    "if the inputs have multiphoton contributions , it is not impossible to obtain a perfect single - photon output state . in particular , consider a state @xmath279 , such that @xmath280 , @xmath281 , and @xmath282 for @xmath283 .",
    "if this state is combined with the vacuum at a beam splitter , and @xmath79 photons are detected , then the output state will be a pure single - photon state .",
    "this result also demonstrates that there is no initial value for the single - photon probability that can not be improved upon .",
    "the drawback to these results is that states such as @xmath284 would be very difficult to produce in the laboratory .",
    "it is likely that there is some measure of the quality of the state that can not be improved upon using linear optics and photodetection .",

    "a measure that is non - increasing under linear optics and photodetection is a promising direction for future research .",
    "triggered single - photon sources produce an incoherent mixture of zero and one photons , with much smaller probabilities for two or more photons . provided the multiphoton contributions in the inputs",
    "may be ignored , we have shown that it is possible to significantly increase the probability for a single photon by using post - processing via linear optics and photodetection .",
    "this method has the drawback that it produces a significant multiphoton component that is comparable to that for the poisson distribution .",
    "we have shown that there are severe limitations on what post - processing can be performed .",
    "in particular , there is an upper limit on the increase in the probability for a single photon .",
    "this upper limit can not be achieved , but the method we have found for increasing the probability for a single photon gives the same scaling with the number of modes .",
    "it is likely that this method achieves the maximum increase in the probability for a single photon .",
    "this result is indicated numerically , but has not been proven .",
    "in addition , it is impossible to obtain an increase in the probability for a single photon using a single beam splitter . alternatively ,",

    "<S> triggered single - photon sources produce the vacuum state with non - negligible probability , but produce a much smaller multiphoton component . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore reasonable to approximate the output of these photon sources as a mixture of the vacuum and single - photon states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is impossible to increase the probability for a single photon using linear optics and photodetection on fewer than four modes . </S>",
    "<S> this impossibility is due to the incoherence of the inputs ; if the inputs were pure - state superpositions , it would be possible to obtain a perfect single - photon output . in the more general case </S>",
    "<S> , a chain of beam splitters can be used to increase the probability for a single photon , but at the expense of adding an additional multiphoton component . </S>",
    "<S> this improvement is robust against detector inefficiencies , but is degraded by dark counts or multiphoton components in the input . </S>"
