    "a very useful way to get important spectroscopic information is by measuring magneto - optical rotation ( mor ) of a plane polarized light propagating through a medium @xcite .",
    "clearly it is desirable to obtain as large an angle of rotation as possible @xcite .",
    "it is known that the angle of rotation is proportional to the density of the medium .",
    "thus an increase in density will help in achieving large rotation angles .",
    "recently , very large rotation angles in a cold sample have been reported @xcite . in this experiment ,",
    "optical densities of the order of @xmath1 were achieved .",
    "this experiment also reported a very interesting result , viz .",
    ", the departure from the linear dependence of the rotation angle on the optical density .",
    "this departure has been ascribed to the nonmonochromatic nature of the input laser .",
    "the findings of the experiment warrant a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the rotation angle on the spectral profile of the input laser .",
    "we present a first principle calculation of this dependence .",
    "note that a nonlinear dependence on optical density can not result from a simple argument based on the standard formula for the rotation angle @xmath2 : @xmath3 where , @xmath4 is the wave - number of the electric field , @xmath5 is the length of the medium , and @xmath6 represent the linear susceptibilities of the medium for right or left circularly polarized components of the input field . since @xmath6 are proportional to the number density , the rotation angle becomes proportional to the optical density @xmath7 defined by @xmath8 where , @xmath9 is the wavelength of the input field , @xmath10 is the number density of the atomic medium .",
    "if one were to argue that spectrally impure laser field would replace @xmath6 by their averages over the width of the laser , then @xmath2 would continue to be proportional to the optical density @xmath7 .",
    "a more quantitative analysis of the rotation angle is thus warranted .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic ] , we recapitulate the relevant equations for studies of mor in atomic medium . in sec .  [",
    "sec : three ] , we describe a simple three - level atomic configuration in the context of mor and discuss the effect of laser line - shape and magnetic field in a thick atomic medium . in sec .",
    "[ sec : general ] , we consider experimental configuration used in @xcite .",
    "we show , how in an optically thick medium , one deviates from the linear dependence of rotation on optical density as a result of the spectral impurity of the laser field .",
    "we give a quantitative analysis of the experimental data .",
    "let us consider that an atomic medium of length @xmath5 is resonantly excited by a monochromatic @xmath11-polarized electric field @xmath12 where , @xmath13 is the field amplitude and @xmath14 is the wave number of the field , @xmath15 and @xmath16 being the corresponding angular frequency and wavelength .",
    "the field is propagating in @xmath17-direction .",
    "clearly , we can resolve the amplitude of the electric field into its two circular components as @xmath18 where , @xmath19 are the amplitude components along two circular polarization @xmath20 .",
    "while passing through the atomic medium these two circular components behave differently due to the anisotropy of the medium .",
    "let @xmath21 be the susceptibilities of the medium corresponding to the two circular components .",
    "the electric field at the exit face of the medium can be written as @xmath22\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , we have assumed that the medium is dilute so that @xmath23 . in mor",
    ", the polarization direction of the input electric field gets rotated due to the difference in their dispersions ( phase shifts ) in a non - attenuating medium .",
    "the electric field however , remains linearly polarized after passing through the medium . in the present case , because the atom interacts with near - resonant electric field , the two circular components suffer attenuation ( given by the imaginary part of @xmath21 ) while propagating through the medium .",
    "thus the medium , concerned here , is responsible for both dispersion and attenuation .",
    "we term the medium to be both circularly birefringent and circularly dichroic .",
    "the output electric field becomes elliptically polarized under the action of such a medium .",
    "thus to fully characterize the polarization state of the output field , one has to use the stokes parameters @xcite .",
    "the four stokes parameters for an electric field are designated by @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and can be defined as follows :    @xmath26    [ stokes ]    where , @xmath27 is the measured intensity along the polarization direction @xmath28 .",
    "then the output polarization state can be characterized by the following three quantities :    @xmath29    [ defination ]    where , @xmath30 is the degree of polarization , i.e. , the ratio of the intensities of the polarized component to the unpolarized one , @xmath2 is the faraday rotation angle of the input field and is measured between the major axis of the ellipse and the @xmath31-axis , @xmath32 provides the ellipticity of polarization through the relation @xmath33 .    from eq .",

    "note that all the measured quantities defined by eq .",
    "( [ intensity ] ) are functions of the frequency of the exciting field",
    ". if the exciting field is spectrally impure , then the stokes parameters @xmath36 are to be obtained by averaging over the spectrum @xmath37 of the laser field .",
    "thus , @xmath38 s in eq .",

    ". we will demonstrate how the fluctuations of the input field leads to the nonlinear dependence of the rotation angle on optical density .",
    "we first consider a three - level atom in @xmath43 configuration ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) in order to uncover the effect of optical density on mor .",
    "the levels @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) are coupled to the ground state @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) by two circular components @xmath48 of @xmath11-polarized electric field [ eq .",

    "the levels @xmath50 are shifted about line - center by an amount of @xmath51 ( @xmath52=bohr magneton ) .",
    "the field @xmath53 is detuned from the line center by an amount @xmath54 , @xmath55 being the atomic transition frequency in absence of the magnetic field .",
    "the susceptibilities of the @xmath48 components inside the medium can be written as @xmath56 where , @xmath57 is the spontaneous decay rate of the levels @xmath44 , @xmath58 is the magnitude of the dipole moment vector for the transitions @xmath59 , @xmath10 is the atomic number density , and @xmath60 is the zeeman splitting of the excited levels . using these @xmath6 , we can now write the field amplitude from eq .",

    "we clearly see that for @xmath67 , the rotation angle @xmath2 is linearly proportional to @xmath7 .",
    "but for @xmath68 , this variation deviates from linearity in large @xmath7 domain .",
    "this behavior can be explained in terms of the off - resonant components which dominate for the large @xmath65 and large @xmath7 .    in order to understand the numerical results , we first consider the limit of small optical densities whence    @xmath69\\;,\\\\ s_2&=&\\frac{\\alpha}{2}\\textrm{re}(\\rho_--\\rho_+)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ small1 ]    thus , the departure of the rotation angle from the linearity has to do with the averages of the exponentials appearing in @xmath38 s [ eq .

    "we have again recovered the linear dependence of @xmath2 on @xmath7 , provided the approximation ( [ approx ] ) is valid .",
    "thus , any departure in linearity of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath7 indicates the breakdown the approximation ( [ approx ] ) .",
    "the numerical results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] clearly show the breakdown of the mean field description obtained by replacing @xmath70 s by their average values .    from the eq .",
    "( [ small4 ] ) , we readily see that in the low @xmath7-domain , by increasing @xmath66 ( or @xmath65 ) while keeping @xmath65 ( or @xmath66 ) constant , the slope of @xmath2 with @xmath7 decreases .",
    "this is clear from the numerical results of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . also , for larger values of @xmath65 , variation of @xmath2 with @xmath7 is deviated from linearity .",
    "linear variation of @xmath2 with @xmath7 is attributed to the monochromatic laser field .",
    "if the electric field is spectrally impure , then the off - resonant components also contribute to @xmath2 , through the relations ( [ avg ] ) , ( [ stokes ] ) , and ( [ defination ] ) .",
    "thus , @xmath2 starts varying with @xmath7 linearly in low @xmath7 limit , then saturates , and finally decreases to zero to change the direction of rotation , for larger @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "but for smaller @xmath65 , the linear behavior is retained even for larger @xmath7 , as the off - resonant components are not dominant in this parameter zone .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from the above discussion , it is clear that the output field gets rotated as a manifestation of cumulative effect of optical density , magnetic field , and laser line - width .",
    "also it becomes partially polarized with no ellipticity .",
    "we now extend our understanding of resonant mor as described in the previous section to explain the experimental data of labeyrie _",
    "et al._. in their experiment , a cold atomic cloud of rb@xmath0 is subjected to a static magnetic field .",
    "the laser probe beam passing through the medium in the direction of the magnetic field is tuned to the d@xmath77 line of the atoms ( 2s@xmath78 2p@xmath79 ; @xmath16=780.2 nm ) .",
    "they have measured the intensities of outputs with different polarizations , as function of laser detuning and also at different values of optical density .",
    "they have found a nonlinear dependence of the mor angle @xmath2 on optical density .",
    "they found for larger magnetic field that the linear behavior is recovered .",
    "to explain these observations , we consider the relevant energy levels of rb@xmath0 as used in the experiment ( see fig .  [ fig16 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11-polarized electric field ( [ field ] ) is applied to cold rb@xmath0 medium near resonantly .",

    "the circular components @xmath48 of the input electric field ( [ field ] ) interact with the transitions @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "we assume that the electric field is weak enough so that it is sufficient to use the linear response of the system to the laser field .",
    "we neglect the ground - state coherences . as we are considering the cold atoms , we neglect the collisional relaxations and doppler broadening of the sublevels .",
    "we also assume that the atomic population is equally distributed over all the ground sublevels .    using all these assumptions , we can write the susceptibilities @xmath6 for the @xmath48 components as the sum of the susceptibilities of all the relevant @xmath82 transitions in the following way : @xmath83 where , @xmath84 is the relative amount of zeeman shift of the excited sublevel @xmath85 with respect to the zeeman shifted ground sublevel @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the land - g factors of the ground and excited levels , respectively .",
