    "in systems of interacting electrons in one dimension certain physical phenomena such as damping of the elementary excitations and energy relaxation , are beyond the reach of the conventional tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) model ; see , _ e.g. _ , ref .  [ ] for a review .",
    "this may be understood from the fact that , for such a model , the spectrum of the interacting electrons is in exact one - to - one correspondence with the one of free bosons .",
    "@xcite in diagrammatic terms this correspondence is generally referred to in the literature as the dzyaloshinskii - larkin ( dl ) theorem ;  @xcite see also refs .",

    "inelastic processes responsible for a finite life - time of the elementary excitations and relaxation in one dimension may , however , be accessed by abandoning tomonaga s approximation of linearizing the electron dispersion relation  @xcite at the expense of losing the exact solvability of the model .",
    "a number of methods have been developed , especially during the last decade , to address these issues thereby generating a considerable amount of work ; see ref .",
    "[ ] and references therein .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to emphasize the importance of yet another approach based on the direct analysis of the lowest order multi - loop diagrams which are beyond the dl theorem .",
    "a review of the method for the computation of equilibrium properties will first be presented . on this basis ,",
    "microscopic processes responsible for the equilibration of one - dimensional ( 1d ) electrons will be identified",
    ". the analysis will be qualitative but will nevertheless allow us to give an estimate of the relaxation rate of thermal carriers in quantum wires .",
    "this estimate agrees with the recent literature on the subject .",
    "the tl model is exactly solvable thanks to two crucial approximations related to the shape of the electron dispersion relation and to the nature of the scattering processes between the electrons .",
    "the former consists in linearizing the electron dispersion relation : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the fermi points , @xmath2 correspond to the chiralities of the fermions ( @xmath3 for right movers near @xmath4 and @xmath5 for left movers near @xmath6 ) , and @xmath7 is the fermi velocity . as will be seen shortly , it is this approximation which is responsible for the fact that low - energy excitations are free bosons , _",
    "i.e. _ , quantized sound waves  @xcite of the 1d system .",
    "the properties of these collective modes are encoded in the density - density correlation function , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the density operator . for non - interacting electrons",
    ", this correlation function reduces to a 1-loop diagram , see fig .",

    "it reads  @xcite [ pi - ff ] _",
    "^(0)(i , q ) = , where @xmath10 is the energy of the boson of momentum @xmath11 and @xmath2 refer to the chirality of the fermions .",
    "the total polarization operator is given by : @xmath12 .",
    "the imaginary part of the retarded polarization operator defines the dynamical structure factor ( dsf ) : @xmath13 . combining this definition with eq .",
    "( [ pi - ff ] ) yields s^(0 ) ( , q ) = ( - v_f|q| ) , [ dsf - ff ] where we assume that @xmath14 for simplicity . equation  ( [ dsf - ff ] ) together with the @xmath15-sum rule  @xcite _ 0^   s(,q ) = |n  , [ fsr ] where @xmath16 is the average electron density along the wire , show that indeed the free boson of energy @xmath17 exhausts the @xmath15-sum rule .",
    "a coupling between the collective modes can be achieved by taking into account small deviations from linear dispersion .",
    "away from half - filling , the first correction is due to the curvature of the electron dispersion relation : @xmath18 , which introduces an additional parameter , @xmath19 , the band mass such that : @xmath20 , at small fillings . including this non - linearity , the free fermion polarization operator and dsf ( at @xmath21 ) become    [ ff+m ] & & ^(0)(i , q)= , [ pi - ff+m ] + & & s^(0)(,q ) = , [ dsf - ff+m ]    where the two - parametric family appears : @xmath22 .",
    "the spectral weight now spreads over a range of frequencies : @xmath23 .",
    "the latter corresponds to a continuum of single ( particle - hole ) pair excitations  @xcite which is responsible for the strong damping of the sound mode . from eq .",
    "( [ dsf - ff+m ] ) we see that the @xmath15-sum rule of eq .",
    "( [ fsr ] ) is now exhausted by the single - pair excitations .",
    "scattering process @xmath24 and bare chiral propagators ( solid line for right movers , dashed line for left movers , wiggly line for the interaction ) with non - linear dispersion : @xmath18 . ]",
    "the second approximation made in the tl model is that only forward - scattering processes associated with small momentum transfers are taken into account .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless coupling constants are noted @xmath25 and @xmath24 for processes involving the scattering of electrons of the same and of different chiralities , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] for @xmath24 . on the other hand , backscattering ( @xmath26 ) and umklapp scattering ( @xmath27 ) , which are characterized by large momentum transfers are neglected . under these assumptions ,",

    "@xcite it describes a 1d metal ; _ i.e. _ , excitations are gapless .",
    "the difference with the 3d ( fermi liquid ) case may be seen  @xcite perturbatively from the electron - electron scattering rate and quasi - particle residue : @xmath29 and @xmath30_{\\eps=\\xi_k}$ ] , respectively , where @xmath31 is the electron self - energy ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - one - loop+sigma-2-loop](b ) for the @xmath24 process .",
    "the latter determine the dressed single particle green s function , @xmath32 and the spectral function , @xmath33 . for a fermi liquid ( fl ) , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , implying the existence of well - defined quasi - particles : @xmath36 , @xmath37 with a lorentzian spectral line - shape .",
    "in 1d on the other hand , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the scattering rate is therefore of the order of the energy of the particle : @xmath40 , and the quasi - particle residue vanishes logarithmically at low energies : @xmath41 , as in a marginal fermi liquid .",
    "@xcite at very weak couplings , @xmath42 , fermionic quasi - particles survive above an exponentially small energy scale : @xmath43 .",
    "however , the linear dependence on energy of the scattering rate implies that the spectral line shape is non - lorentzian with high - frequency tails scaling as @xmath44 , in contrast to the fermi - liquid case .    concerning the bosonic correlation function ,",
    "the combined assumptions of forward - scattering interactions and linear dispersion imply that there is no higher order correction to the lowest order diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : pi - one - loop+sigma-2-loop](a ) . in this sense",
    "the tl model is exact at one loop .",
    "this is the essence of the dl ( or loop - cancellation ) theorem which allows for an exact computation of all correlation functions at arbitrary interaction strength .",
    "@xcite beyond weak coupling , single - particle excitations disappear and the system becomes a non - fermi liquid . concerning the collective mode , interactions renormalize its velocity , @xmath45 , and bring a prefactor , @xmath46 , fixed by the @xmath15-sum rule in the expression of the dsf , which may then be written as @xmath47 .",
    "bosons therefore remain free and the boson - fermion mapping implies that there is no relaxation in the tl model .     ( a ) one - loop polarization diagram and ( b ) two - loop electron self - energy ( for a right mover ) for the scattering process @xmath24 . ]",
    "as anticipated in the introduction , relaxation requires both dispersion non - linearity and interactions among the electrons .",
    "the former is irrelevant in the renormalization group sense and is not expected to affect the infrared properties of the model .",
    "but when combined with interactions among the fermions the dl theorem breaks down and multi - loop corrections appear providing a variety of collision processes .",
    "presently , no consistent resummation scheme exists to take into account these processes in a non - perturbative way . in the following",
    "we will therefore simply focus on the lowest order non - trivial corrections beyond the dl theorem and relate such corrections to the equilibration of 1d interacting fermions .",
    "we assume that both the interactions among the electrons and the deviations from linear dispersion are weak and take them into account in perturbation theory . for simplicity , we focus on spinless fermions , _",
    "i.e. _ , fully spin - polarized electrons . in this case",
    "there is no distinction between @xmath26 and @xmath24 processes .",
    "the combinations @xmath25 and @xmath48 are then invariant under the renormalization group flow and have to be taken into account . if we assume that electrons interact via the realistic 3d coulomb interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath49 , where @xmath11 is the 1d momentum transfer and @xmath50 the width of the wire , these coupling constants depend on momentum only logarithmically . in the following",
    "we will neglect this marginal dependence keeping in mind , however , that @xmath51/2\\pi v_f \\rightarrow g_2 \\not=0 $ ] , in the logarithmic approximation .",
    "then , to logarithmic accuracy , direct and exchange processes involving @xmath25 cancel each other and we are left with the momentum - independent process @xmath24 , see fig .  [",
    "fig : g2 ] .",
    "this considerably reduces the number of diagrams that have to be considered , thereby simplifying the diagrammatic study while keeping track of the most important microscopic processes .    with these assumptions in hand ,",
    "the lowest order non - trivial diagrams that need to be considered are the three - loop diagrams displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi-3loop ] . for clarity they have been separated into three groups with obvious notations : `` chiral '' @xmath52 diagrams as well as a group of `` mixed '' @xmath53 diagrams generally referred to as the aslamasov - larkin diagrams in the literature .",
