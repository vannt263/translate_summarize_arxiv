    "helium , the second most abundant chemical element in the universe , is expected to be singly ionised at the same time as hydrogen due to its similar ionisation potential ( @xmath4 ) , larger photo - ionisation cross - section and lower abundance relative to hydrogen .",
    "even for ionising sources with relatively soft , stellar like spectra , the reionisation of and in the igm is expected to be concurrent ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast , the much larger ionisation threshold ( @xmath5 ) and smaller photo - ionisation cross - section of singly ionised helium requires that reionisation proceeds only when sources with sufficiently hard spectra become numerous . a putative population of massive , metal free stars ( @xcite ) , high redshift x - rays",
    "( @xcite ) or thermal emission from shock heated gas ( @xcite ) may provide the requisite ionising photons .",
    "the stacked spectra of lyman break galaxies at @xmath6 ( @xcite ) also exhibit an recombination line strong enough to suggest that galaxies may contribute significantly to reionisation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , quasars are considered to be the most likely candidates for completing reionisation ( @xcite ) , although bright quasars are rare at high redshift and unlikely to contribute substantially to either the or ionising photon budget at @xmath7 ( @xcite ) . consequently , unless reionisation was completed by an as yet unidentified population of sources with hard spectra at @xmath7 , its latter stages are expected to coincide with the observed peak in quasar activity around @xmath8",
    ".    there are several pieces of observational evidence which may support this picture .",
    "observations of the gunn - peterson trough and patchy absorption in the forest at @xmath9 indicate a situation analogous to that implied by the opacity data at @xmath10 ( @xcite ) . however , like the measurements at higher redshift ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the interpretation of the data is hampered by its insensitivity to the fraction once the absorption becomes saturated .",
    "other indirect evidence includes an apparent boost to the igm temperature at @xmath11 ( @xcite ) , measurements of metal line ratios which indicate the ultraviolet ( uv ) background is hardening around the same redshifts ( @xcite ) , and the detection of a sharp dip in the forest effective optical depth at @xmath12 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the latter result may be associated with the observed boost in the igm temperature at the same redshifts ( @xcite ) . on the other hand",
    ", conflicting evidence exists for all of these cases ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the observational evidence for reionisation remains controversial .",
    "nevertheless , from a theoretical standpoint it is still expected reionisation will have a significant impact on the thermal state of the igm ( @xcite ) .",
    "firstly , energy injected by the hard sources which reionise will raise the igm temperature .",
    "this is consistent with some of the observational constraints derived from forest line widths which imply a boost of @xmath13@xmath14 around @xmath6 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the magnitude of the increase will depend on the spectrum of the intrinsic ionising radiation , and thus also on the amount it is subsequently filtered by the intervening igm ( @xcite ) .",

    ", the igm will follow a tight polytropic temperature - density relation , @xmath15 , expected to arise for normalised densities @xmath16 when photo - heating by a spatially uniform uv background is balanced by cooling due to adiabatic expansion ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the assumption of a spatially uniform uv background ionising an optically thin igm will break down during reionisation . instead",
    ", radiative transfer effects and/or the inhomogeneous distribution of the ionising sources will produce a complex , multi - valued and perhaps even inverted ( @xmath17 ) temperature - density relation ( @xcite ) .    despite all of these studies , very little work has been done to establish a physical argument for exactly how large the temperature boost in the igm during reionisation will be .",
    "furthermore , it is unclear over what timescale any global temperature boost should occur .",
    "this depends on understanding how photo - heating in an optically thick igm proceeds , and thus on the details of radiative transfer through the inhomogeneous igm .",
    "the observational evidence provides valuable hints , but the data are still too poorly constrained to distinguish between different models in detail . a wide variety of values for the temperature boost during reionisation , @xmath18 , have therefore been adopted in the literature , with the timescales for the temperature boost varying from instantaneous to periods spanning several redshift units ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the main reason for this is that photo - heating in an optically thick igm during reionisation is almost always modelled in an approximate way . only a handful of studies",
    "have explicitly quantified the expected igm temperature boost during reionisation using radiative transfer calculations .",
    "@xcite were the first to point out the importance of radiative transfer through an optically thick igm .",
    "using one dimensional radiative transfer simulations , they found the filtering of ionising radiation through the igm could increase photo - heating rates by a factor of @xmath19@xmath20 above the optically thin values , leading to @xmath21 .",
    "more recently , @xcite demonstrated that the temperature boost depends sensitively on the typical spectra of the sources which drive reionisation .",
    "finally , @xcite have presented a detailed , three dimensional radiative transfer simulation of reionisation .",
    "they found that radiative transfer effects could boost the igm temperature by around a factor of two .",
    "however , none of these studies explicitly discuss over what timescale this heat input may reasonably occur , or how the temperature boost depends in detail on the density distribution of the intervening igm .",
    "a clear understanding of photo - heating during reionisation is thus vital for interpreting the thermal history of the igm . in this paper",
    "we critically re - examine the photo - heating of the igm by quasars during reionisation .",
    "in particular , using a combination of analytical arguments and line - of - sight radiative transfer calculations , we shall address what the likely temperature boost in the igm during reionisation is , and how rapidly this temperature boost should occur .",
    "furthermore , we consider what the fate of the hard photons responsible for heating the igm is likely to be : where do they end up in the igm , and how important is the filtering of ionising radiation through the igm in setting the temperature during reionisation ?    we begin in  2 , where we briefly outline the relationship between photo - heating and the photo - ionisation timescale .",
    "this argument is key to establishing the amount of heat which may be injected into the igm within a given time . in ",
    "3 we present a model for estimating the maximum temperature achievable during reionisation in an optically thick igm .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the filtering of ionising photons through a clumpy medium is presented in  4 , and in  5 we consider the impact of photo - heating in recombining fossil regions .",
    "we then compare our analytical results with detailed line - of - sight radiative transfer simulations in  6 , and use these results to discuss the impact of reionisation on the igm temperature density relation in  7 .",

    "although this argument is applied here to a single optically thin gas parcel for simplicity , it also extends more generally to the igm as a whole . a substantial temperature boost in the igm",
    "can only occur globally within a timescale @xmath75 if the ionising background is sufficiently hard _ and _ intense .",
    "if the condition @xmath76 is not met everywhere , the ionisation rate is too low to significantly photo - heat the entire igm .",
    "instead , temperature boosts are possible only in the vicinity of quasars where the local photo - ionisation rate is large .",
    "alternatively , a large , global igm temperature boost over longer timescales is still possible if the ionising background is weak , yet hard and persistent .",
    "crucially , these scenarios depend on exactly how many hard photons are produced by quasars over time and the impact of the subsequent transfer of radiation though the igm on the intrinsic quasar emission . bearing these points in mind , we now proceed to discuss the expected temperature of the igm during reionisation in more detail .",
    "the temperature boost in the igm during reionisation is approximately ( @xcite )    @xmath77    where @xmath78 is the fraction in the igm when photo - heating commences .",
    "this assumes the excess energy per photo - ionisation is shared equally among all the baryons in the igm through coulomb interactions . in the optically thin limit ,",
    "@xmath79 for @xmath80 , giving @xmath81 .",

    "the average excess energy per photo - ionisation is therefore progressively larger the further from the ionising source ( @xcite ) .",
    "this hardened , filtered ionising radiation can then impart a significant temperature boost to the igm compared to the optically thin case . in the optically thick limit , where every ionising photon is eventually absorbed and one may ignore the @xmath68 weighting from the photo - ionisation cross - section , @xmath84 for @xmath80 , leading to @xmath85 .",
    "thus , a conventional interpretation is that any large , global boost to the igm temperature at @xmath9 ( inferred either directly or indirectly from observations ) may be due to photo - heating rates which are amplified by radiative transfer effects during reionisation ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "recall , however , that irrespective of how large @xmath86 is , no significant photo - heating will occur in a patch of the igm over timescales shorter than the local photo - ionisation timescale , @xmath72 .",
    "ionising radiation is significantly weakened as well as hardened at progressively larger distances from an ionising source .",
    "this clearly has implications for the @xmath87 attainable over a fixed timescale .",
    "the hardest , most highly filtered radiation may be too weak to significantly heat a patch of the igm over the short timescales associated with quasar activity .",
    "quantifying the effect of this filtering and weakening of the ionising radiation field on the igm temperature evolution is non - trivial ; the temperature will depend on the density distribution of the intervening igm , the intrinsic spectra and luminosities of the ionising sources , their spatial distribution and their lifetimes .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of radiative transfer are therefore required to fully address this issue .",
    "we may nevertheless develop some intuition by first using a simple toy model for the effect of radiative transfer on the igm temperature .      consider a quasar which emits @xmath88 ionising photons per second above the ionisation threshold where    @xmath89    and which has a broken power law spectrum given by ( _ e.g. _ @xcite )    @xmath90    there are a wide range of values for the extreme uv ( euv ) spectral index , @xmath33 , observed in the quasar population at @xmath91 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt a fiducial value of @xmath80 , consistent with the mean @xcite obtain for radio - quiet quasars .",
    "however , the euv spectral index is a significant uncertainty .",
    "for example , @xcite find a somewhat softer mean euv index of @xmath92 may be appropriate , while on the other hand @xcite find @xmath93 at @xmath94 .",
    "we therefore also consider softer and harder quasar spectra with @xmath95 and @xmath96 , broadly consistent with the dispersion in @xmath33 measured by @xcite .",
    "the rate at which ionising photons are produced by such a quasar with b - band luminosity @xmath97 ( where @xmath98 evaluated at @xmath99 ) is then    @xmath100    an @xmath101 quasar at @xmath102 yields @xmath103 for @xmath104 .",
    "note the quasar spectrum which is harder / softer than the fiducial @xmath105 model also emits many more / less ionising photons below the ionisation threshold for fixed @xmath97 .",
    "quasars with @xmath106 are expected to dominate the ionising emissivity at @xmath107 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt @xmath108 as the fiducial luminosity throughout this paper .",
    "let us now invoke a cut - off at some arbitrary frequency in the quasar spectrum above the ionisation threshold , @xmath109 .",
    "one may think of this as a condition which requires @xmath110 for @xmath111 and @xmath112 for @xmath113 , so the igm is optically thin only to photons with frequencies above the cut - off .",
    "this is obviously a simplification of the full radiative transfer problem ; in reality the optical depth is a continuous function of frequency and the amount of attenuation will depend on the density distribution of the intervening igm .",
    "this approach is nevertheless useful because it crudely mimics the effect of the filtering and weakening of the ionising radiation emitted by the quasar .",
    "the photo - ionisation rate at a comoving distance @xmath114 from the quasar is    @xmath115    it is then straightforward to integrate this expression to obtain    @xmath116 @xmath117    the photo - ionisation rate is thus strongly dependent on the frequency of the assumed cut - off in the ionising spectrum , where @xmath118 . on the other hand ,",

    "note that this simple argument does not include any information regarding the likelihood ionising radiation is filtered by the assumed amount , nor the timescale for which it remains filtered ; to do so requires a detailed knowledge of the intervening igm density distribution .",
    "rather , this model assumes _ a priori _ that the quasar radiation is already filtered by the igm as parameterised by the frequency cut - off @xmath122 , and remains so throughout the lifetime of the ionising source .",

    "we adopt the upper limit of @xmath125 yr  which conservatively maximises the effect of photo - heating  as the fiducial lifetime , although we will discuss the effect of shorter quasar lifetimes later .      this toy model",

    "a hard , intense ionising radiation field is in any case unlikely to be maintained in such close proximity to the quasar for long periods . as noted by @xcite ( and see also  6 ) , the igm will instead quickly become optically thin to all ionising photons , thereby limiting the temperature boost within this region to a substantially smaller value . over a quasar lifetime of @xmath130 ,",
    "the temperature boost is restricted to @xmath138 at @xmath139 from the quasar , and even less at larger distances .",
    "note again , however , that the exact amount of filtering will depend sensitively on the intervening density distribution of the igm .",
    "in addition , we stress these temperatures represent the _ maximum _ possible values within a fixed volume around a quasar , since all photons with @xmath140 are neglected in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cutofftemp ] ) .",
    "although these low energy photons do increase the total ionisation rate , they _ decrease _ the average heating .",
    "these estimates also ignore the effect of any cooling on the resulting igm temperature .",
    "greater temperatures boosts can be achieved out to larger distances around a quasar for either a harder intrinsic spectrum , a brighter luminosity , or both .",

    "[ fig : mfp ] , yields much smaller temperatures for a given amount of filtering .",
    "this simple model clearly illustrates the difficulty of attaining substantial temperature boosts over large volumes in the igm within short timescales .",
    "for typical quasar euv spectral indices and luminosities , except for regions in close proximity to the quasar , there are simply not enough hard photons to raise the igm temperature substantially above the value expected in the optically thin limit .",

    "if the lifetimes of optically bright quasars are significantly shorter than @xmath130 ( @xcite ) , or if a patch of the igm has @xmath146 as might be expected if fossil regions are common prior to the completion of reionisation ( @xcite ) , then the temperature boost around a single quasar will be accordingly smaller .",
    "thus , for our fiducial quasar model a boost to the igm temperature on timescales @xmath147 ( @xmath148 at @xmath9 ) in excess of @xmath149 appears unlikely over scales of @xmath150 .",
    "given that the average separation between @xmath151 quasars is @xmath152 ( @xcite ) , this implies that a rapid _ global _ igm temperature boost in excess of @xmath153 is difficult to achieve .    one important caveat , however , is that we have applied the above argument to the photo - heating around individual quasars only .",
    "over longer timescales , the integrated effect of photons emitted by distant quasars with highly filtered spectra could produce a more gradual yet larger igm temperature boost .",
    "however , we shall see it is quite difficult to reionise the igm with _ only _ hard photons , so the actual temperature boost will likely be even smaller than these estimates .",
    "we address this issue in more detail in ",
    "[ peng_section ] .",
    "thus far we have have focused on the expected temperature boost in the igm without explicitly quantifying the _ amount _ of filtering which occurs through an optically thick , inhomogeneous igm .",
    "furthermore , we have not considered _ where _ in the igm these hard photons are subsequently absorbed . in this section ,",
    "we consider some simple analytical arguments for the amount of filtering expected , and the fate of hard photons . while less rigorous , these serve to motivate the detailed numerical calculations that follow later , and promote physical intuition .",
    "specifically , we shall address two key arguments for substantial heating during reionisation , which we briefly restate here .",
    "firstly , we know from the lifting of the gunn - peterson trough at @xmath154 along multiple lines - of - sight that most of the in the universe has been reionised by this time ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "thus , all that matters is the average heat input per photo - ionisation , which as discussed earlier is simply @xmath155 for an optically thick igm .",
    "this has to be true from a simple energy conservation standpoint , and implies significant heating .",
    "secondly , the spacing between quasars is much larger than the spacing between lyman limit systems , which dominate the opacity ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus , most of the igm is exposed to filtered , hardened radiation . while such radiation is undoubtedly weakened , even if the photo - ionisation rate is low over long periods of time it may again still be possible to achieve substantial heating from a weak but persistent and hard ionising background .",
    "thus , while we have so far demonstrated that it is difficult to achieve a large temperature boost globally in the igm over short timescales , it still appears to be possible over longer periods of time .    while the latter scenario is certainly feasible , there are a number of uncertainties and caveats , which have not been emphasised in the literature . in particular : ( i ) while the average energy per ionisation in an optically thick igm is indeed @xmath156 , dense regions preferentially absorb hard photons .",
    "the energy per photo - ionisation in the low density regions may therefore be systematically less than the average , since the average heat input in the observable igm depends on the relative collective opacity of optically thin and thick systems .",
    "note that virtually all statistical measures of temperature in the forest are sensitive to the optically thin , underdense to mildly overdense regions . as an example , the low column density forest ( where doppler line widths are directly measurable ) corresponds to regions of fairly low overdensity @xcite .",
    "( ii ) there are many generations of quasars . while at any given time a patch of the igm may be exposed only to filtered radiation , over many generations a nearby quasar will eventually be able to directly ionise that patch with only modestly filtered radiation . reionising the igm exclusively via soft photons does not require an unrealistic photon budget , even with a substantial population of lyman limit systems .",
    "why should hard photons be preferentially absorbed in dense systems ?",
    "we can gain some physical insight from a simple toy model .",
    "let us consider a uniform igm filled with a single population of absorbers of fixed mass and some overdensity @xmath157 .",
    "for this population , the radial size of the absorbers @xmath158 , and hence the optical depth @xmath159 . the effective optical depth due to the absorbers has two interesting limits .",
    "when @xmath157 is low so that the absorbers are optically thin , @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the mean number of absorbers encountered along a line - of - sight , @xmath162 is the mean optical depth of a single absorber , and @xmath163 is the absorber cross - section . in this limit , the effective optical depth is independent of the overdensity @xmath157 of absorbers : @xmath164 , but for increasing overdensity their cross - section falls , and thus fewer absorbers , @xmath165 , are encountered along a line - of - sight . on the other hand , once the absorbers become optically thick , their contribution to the opacity saturates , and @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the total mass fraction of in the absorbers .",
    "this implies that    @xmath168    thus , on average fewer photons are absorbed in optically thick absorbers , since only the photosphere ( @xmath169 ) contributes to the opacity . for hard photons",
    "the absorbers are optically thin , while for soft photons the absorbers are optically thick . thus , a greater fraction of hard photons are absorbed by dense absorbers , rather than the igm , compared to soft photons .",
    "similarly , in the interstellar medium of galaxies , continuum photons can have a higher probability of being absorbed by dusty atomic / molecular clouds ( which are optically thin at these frequencies ) , compared to photons , for which the clouds are optically thick @xcite .",
    "photons is always larger in a clumpy igm compared to a uniform igm , so that the transmission is always dominated by underdense voids ( e.g. @xcite ) .",

    "[ sec : toymodel ] , one might naively expect a faint ionising source to produce less heating due to longer photo - ionisation timescales .",

    "the results from all the simulations will in any case be summarised in the next section .",
    "it is nevertheless clear from these examples that variations in quasar luminosities , lifetimes , and intrinsic spectra , as well as the intervening igm density distribution , will result in a great deal of variation in the thermal and ionisation state of the igm on small scales .",
    "such detailed behaviour can not be adequately captured by analytical or semi - analytical arguments .",
    "they do , however , confirm that our general expectations hold .",
    "for typical quasar luminosities and spectra at @xmath6 , temperature boosts during reionisation in excess of @xmath149 are unlikely to occur rapidly ( @xmath393 ) over the entire igm .",
    "although large temperatures are indeed possible , these are most likely to occur either around very hard sources , or in highly overdense regions of the igm .",
    "furthermore , the hardest photons tend to be preferentially deposited in the densest clumps in the simulations , as is evidenced by the larger temperatures associated with these regions .",
    "most of the low density igm is reionised by the more numerous soft photons , leading to temperature boosts in the range of @xmath394 for @xmath329 .",

    "there is some recent evidence to suggest that the igm temperature - density relation may be substantially more complex than is usually assumed around @xmath107 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have independently noted that the flux distribution of the forest is well reproduced by a model where the voids in the igm are significantly hotter than expected , perhaps due to radiative transfer effects during reionisation which invert ( @xmath17 ) the igm temperature - density relation .",
    "complementary to this , @xcite pointed out that the inhomogeneous distribution of ionising sources will also complicate the igm temperature - density relation ; voids are generally photo - ionised and heated last and are thus hotter towards the end stages of reionisation .",
    "@xcite also demonstrated that the inhomogeneous nature of reionisation will blur the igm temperature - density relation .",

    "note that the @xmath349 temperature - density plane exhibits the highest temperatures around mean density .",

    "the temperature - density relation in an optically thin igm is expected to slowly asymptote to a power - law with @xmath401 following reionisation ( @xcite ) .",

    "the largest temperature boosts occur in the densest regions in the simulations and are substantially higher than those expected in the optically thin limit as discussed in   [ peng_section ] .",
    "this suggests the hardest photons are preferentially deposited in these regions over the lifetime of the quasars .",
    "however , at mean density and below , the temperature boosts are much closer to the optically thin values , and only modest temperature boosts are achieved . in all panels there is also considerable scatter in the temperature - density plane .",
    "this is very different from the tight , power - law temperature - density relation expected for an optically thin igm ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . a similar result was noted by @xcite following reionisation , who found that the temperature - density relation may even be inverted ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "however , this was for a single line - of - sight only and thus not necessarily representative of the igm as a whole .",
    "@xcite also found that radiative transfer effects can alter the temperature - density relation of the igm , and will furthermore depend on the types of sources responsible for reionisation . on the other hand , using three dimensional radiative transfer simulations of reionisation , @xcite found the igm temperature - density relation is not inverted , although the igm temperature is still increased by around a factor of two at mean density .",
    "however , the necessarily approximate frequency integration scheme they use in order to run such a detailed simulation may not model the reprocessing of the ionising radiation field precisely .",
    "it is nevertheless clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : trho ] that although voids in the igm are significantly heated during reionisation , a well - defined , inverted temperature - density relation appears difficult to achieve with line - of - sight radiative transfer alone ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "empirical interpretations of the forest data seem to indicate such an inversion , but ( as noted by @xcite ) the mild inversion apparently required in such studies may simply mimic a more complex relationship between temperature and density in the igm .",
    "following reionisation , the temperature scatter in each model increases considerably , and over the entire igm it may be larger still .",
    "differences in quasar properties and the local density distribution of the igm , as well as the thermal state of the igm immediately prior to reionisation , could enhance the overall scatter .",
    "the simulations also suggest the extent to which reionisation has progressed will have an important effect on the igm temperature - density relation .",
    "prior to the completion of reionisation , a two - phase medium with hot regions and cooler regions of should develop , leading to large fluctuations in the igm temperature .",
    "note that a correct treatment of the timing of reionisation at different densities is also required to model this properly ( @xcite ) , and the reionisation of partially recombined fossil regions will complicate the temperature - density relation yet further .",
    "on the other hand , studies using wavelets ( @xcite ) have failed to detect spatial fluctuations in the igm temperature on small scales at @xmath9 . however , these studies are implicitly predicated on fairly large ( around a factor of two ) temperature boosts ; more modest boosts over small scales may be hard to extract from the data .",
    "in this work we have performed a detailed analysis of the photo - heating of the igm during reionisation using a combination of analytical arguments and numerical radiative transfer models .",
    "our aim was to critically examine the physical processes involved in modelling the fate of hard , ionising photons in the igm and their impact on the thermal evolution of the igm .",
    "the main results of this work are as follows .    1",
    ".   filtering through the igm weakens as well as hardens ionising radiation ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , significant photo - heating of the igm during reionisation can only occur over timescales comparable to or shorter than the local photo - ionisation timescale , @xmath409 , irrespective of the mean excess energy per photo - ionisation , @xmath343 .",
    "consequently , this limits the temperature boost , @xmath87 , attainable over a given timescale within a fixed volume of the igm . for an @xmath151 quasar at @xmath127 with a typical euv spectra index of @xmath80 and a lifetime @xmath410",
    ", @xmath87 will not exceed @xmath411 at distances @xmath150 from the quasar , and will furthermore only do so at @xmath412 if the softer photons near the ionisation edge do not contribute towards photo - ionisation .",
    "for an average separation between @xmath151 quasars of @xmath152 , this implies a global temperature boost of @xmath413 over @xmath414 is difficult to achieve unless quasars with much harder euv spectra are common .",
    "hard photons are preferentially absorbed in the densest regions of the igm where the largest temperature boosts will thus occur .",
    "however , current constraints on the igm temperature based on observations of the low column density forest ( @xcite ) are mainly sensitive to densities close to the cosmic mean or below ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fate of hard photons and expected heating rates thus depends on the relative abundance of high column density @xmath235 absorbers : if most of the heat is deposited in dense systems , we have no way of inferring this from the forest .",
    "unfortunately , the abundance of such systems is rather model - dependent , and varies with the unknown radiation field @xmath189 during reionisation and the correspondence between physical density @xmath187 and observed column densities @xmath415 .",
    "this translates into considerable uncertainties in the photo - heating rates and the resulting igm temperature boost .",
    "a plausible range of values , given model uncertainties , is @xmath416k , somewhat intermediate between the optical thin and thick values of @xmath417k and @xmath418k respectively , for a @xmath419 unprocessed source spectrum .",
    "even though the mean separation between lyman limit systems is comparable to the expected size of regions around @xmath151 quasars , most of the igm could potentially still be ionised primarily by soft photons , at least if quasars are randomly distributed .",
    "if this were the case , the average amount of heating over the entire igm would be relatively modest .",
    "in general , only unusual regions that are far from the ionising sources will be exposed to a highly - filtered spectrum for a long enough period to heat substantially .",
    "this can only happen toward the end of reionisation , because the photo - ionisation timescale is so long for such heavily filtered spectra .",
    "the reheating of partially recombined fossil regions is unlikely to substantially increase the igm temperature beyond that achieved during the first round of reionisation . in general ,",
    "recombination timescales in these fossil regions typically exceed cooling timescales and the average time lag between ionisations by successive generations of quasars .",
    "the net heating is therefore not increased .",
    "we run a detailed set of @xmath328 line - of - sight radiative transfer simulations using a variety of initial conditions to confirm these analytic predictions .",
    "we further demonstrate that the filtering of ionising radiation through the igm will produce a rich thermal structure .",
    "this is likely to be further complicated by the inhomogeneous distribution of the ionising sources and the typically short lifetimes of quasars ( @xcite ) .",
    "this complex , multi - valued temperature - density relation may help to resolve discrepancies between optically thin hydrodynamical simulations of the forest and recent detailed observations ( @xcite )    how do these conclusions compare to the current observational constraints on the igm thermal state at @xmath127 ?",
    "in the case of the magnitude of the igm temperature boost , measurements of the doppler widths of absorption lines in the forest currently offer the best constraints .",
    "the data of @xcite are consistent with a relatively sharp ( @xmath420 ) , large ( @xmath421 ) temperature jump occurring around @xmath422 at densities around the cosmic mean .",
    "however , the error bars on these measurements are still large , and a more gradual , moderate temperature boost , as suggested by this work , is also consistent with the data .",
    "similarly , the results of @xcite are also consistent with a significant and sudden temperature boost at @xmath6 , although large statistical errors again leave a more gentle thermal evolution possible . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite find no evidence for a rapid boost in the igm temperature at @xmath6 .",
    "their constraints , corrected to correspond to measurements at mean density , at most allow only for a modest evolution in the igm temperature ( @xmath423 between @xmath304 ) , and are also consistent with no temperature evolution at all .",
    "a detailed analysis of a large set of high resolution forest spectra , perhaps using alternative temperature sensitive statistics , is necessary to obtain improved constraints on the thermal state of the igm at these redshifts .",
    "another intriguing result which may indirectly favour a rapid heat input scenario , somewhat at odds with the results presented here , is the evidence for a sharp dip ( @xmath424 ) of around @xmath425 per cent in the effective optical depth of the forest at @xmath426 ( @xcite )",
    ". @xcite used hydrodynamical simulations to interpret this feature as being due to a sudden increase in the igm temperature at @xmath427 , such that @xmath428 . however",
    ", our results suggest that it is unlikely this transition could occur globally over such a short period .",
    "alternatively , this feature may instead be due to a rapid change in the hydrogen photo - ionisation rate at @xmath426 , although again there is no current evidence to suggest this may be the case . further investigation into this feature using detailed hydrodynamical simulations of the igm is thus desirable .    our results therefore suggest a general picture for the thermal evolution of the igm during reionisation by quasars where : ( i ) the temperature boost during reionisation is significantly uncertain , and could be considerably less than has been commonly assumed in the optically thick heating limit , ( ii ) any such temperature boost must be achieved over a timescale longer than @xmath429 and ( iii ) the resulting temperature - density relation in the igm will be much more complex than the tight , power - law temperature density relation expected in an optically thin igm . finally , we note that these results will not apply if the in the igm is predominantly reionised by sources other than quasars .",
    "if the in the igm is reionised early on by stellar sources , high redshift x - rays , thermal emission from shocked gas or some other , as yet unidentified source , then the thermal evolution of the igm during reionisation may be rather different .",
