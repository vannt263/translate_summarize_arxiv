    "we have recently identified a correlation space for broad line agn involving:(1 ) balmer line width ( fwhm ( ) ) , ( 2 ) relative strength of optical   and  emission lines ( the equivalent width ratio of  emission in the range 44354685   and the broad component of : w()/w()= ) , ( 3 ) soft x - ray photon index  and ( 4 )  broad line profile centroid shift @xcite . in simplest terms",
    "the parameters can be said to measure : ( 1 ) the broad line region ( blr ) velocity dispersion , ( 2 ) the relative strengths of low ionization lines that are thought to arise in the same structure , ( 3 ) the strength of a ( thermal ) soft x - ray photon excess , and ( 4 ) the amplitude of systematic radial motions in the high ionization gas .",
    "we call this parameter space `` eigenvector 1 '' ( hereafter e1 ) reflecting its partial origin in a principal component analysis of the low redshift ( z@xmath20.5 ) part of the palomar - green quasar sample ( boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "e1 allows us to discriminate between most agn classes that show broad emission lines @xcite .",
    "e1 separates the majority of radio - quiet ( rq ) sources from radio - loud ( rl ) agn .",
    "the e1 parameter space distribution also suggests the possible existence of two rq classes .",
    "population a with fwhm ( ) @xmath2 4000  and average e1 parameter values : ( a ) @xmath3 0.7 , ( b )  @xmath3 2.8 and ( c )  centroid ( blue)shift @xmath4",
    ". population b includes all of the remaining rq agn with fwhm ( ) @xmath5 4000 and shows average e1 parameter values : ( a )  @xmath6 , ( b ) @xmath7   and , ( c )  centroid shift @xmath8 0 .",
    "see @xcite for sample variance and other details .",
    "rl and rq population b sources occupy a similar parameter domain in e1 and show a large number of other observational similarities @xcite .    after reviewing the occupancy of the optical e1 parameter plane ( fwhm ( ) vs. ) and defining a `` main sequence '' for rq population a",
    ", we show that the mean ionization level of the broad lines decrease as one goes from rq population b to population a sources (  [ ion ] ) . in  [ iondec ] , we show how this result and the occupancy of the parameter plane can be explained in terms of different values of the eddington ratio ( analyzed in  [ edd ] ) convolved with the effect of source orientation ( discussed in  [ orient ] and [ edd ] ) .",
    "we also consider potentially important outlier sources in  [ out ] and in [ balqso ] .",
    "population a sources show a clear and significant correlation among the e1 parameters while rq population b and rl sources show a larger scatter with no obvious correlation .",
    "rq population b sources occupy the same e1 parameter domain as , especially , flat spectrum ( core dominated ) rl sources ( see table 2 in @xcite ) .",
    "it is however important to recognize that uncertainties are larger for most measures of rl and rq population b sources .",
    "limited s / n and line blending limit the accuracy of  equivalent width measurements for sources with w ( ) @xmath2 20   ( @xmath20.2 ) . that is why we can not rule out the possibility that the rq population a correlation extends into the rq population b domain .",
    "at any rate , the rl sources are preferentially found in the same e1 domain as rq population b , and are rarely found in the domain of population a. the concepts of a rq population a  population b difference and of a rq population b ",
    "rl similarity were motivated by the optical parameters but they are reinforced by x - ray  and uv  line shift measures .",
    "these differences / similarities are true irrespective of the reality of a parameter space break between population a and b @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig01 ] presents a schematic view of source occupancy in the fwhm ( ) vs.  parameter plane .",
    "we show correlation trends for : ( 1 ) our sample @xcite , ( 2 ) two radio - loud samples @xcite , and ( 3 ) a soft x - ray selected sample @xcite .",
    "the solid lines representing ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) connect average values for sources in fwhm ( ) ranges 02000 , 20004000 and @xmath5 4000  respectively .",
    "all samples show the same general trends with broad line , -weak rq population b / rl sources displaced towards the upper left and narrow line , strong , population a rq towards the lower right .",
    "these lines indicate a tendency for agn to lie along a `` main sequence '' ( ms ) .",
    "in addition to some prototype sources , we show data points for   strong ( fir bright ) quasars @xcite .",
    "the @xcite sources are shown as a single point representing their average fwhm ( ) and , with the exception of two objects , iras 0759 + 651 and mark 231 which are reported individually in fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] .",
    "we also identify all known broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos with absorption w ( ) @xmath9    from the @xcite and @xcite samples . for pg quasars , data on absorption w ( ) were obtained from @xcite except for pg 1351 + 234 , for which we measured the  absorption on the iue spectrum swp54205 .",
    "we see that i zw 1 ( and other nlsy1 ) , as well as several ( low z ) bal qsos , are located toward the high  end of the ms .",
    "one could infer from figure [ fig01 ] that the ms may extend from the broadest double - peaked rl sources to the narrowest and strongest sources ( like phl 1092 ) .",
    "it is not yet clear if these extrema should be considered outliers or extensions of the correlation found for the bulk of rq population a sources studied so far ( see also  [ disc ] ) .",
    "we can identify one clear class of outliers : sources occupying the upper right quadrant of the e1 plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig01 ] , which turn out to be all bal qsos .",
    "these are sources with fwhm ( ) @xmath5 3000  and @xmath5 1 ) . in general , sources with @xmath10 [ fwhm()/(2500 ) ] @xmath11  ( which approximately defines the upper boundary to the ms of @xcite ) are sources with  in excess of the mean value expected for a given fwhm ( ) .",
    "they will be briefly considered in  [ balqso ] .",
    "table 1 shows relevant mean parameter values for rq population a and b sources as well as for the extreme population a nlsy1 sources .",
    "all averages and sample standard deviations are from @xcite except for i()/i ( ) which comes from hst data @xcite .",
    "the decrease in equivalent width of  ( our representative high ionization line ) along with an increase in w ( ) ( low ionization emission ) suggest a systematic decrease in ionization level from rq population b to population a. we interpret the data in table 1 by considering the behavior of i()/i ( ) , w ( ) and w ( ) as a function of the ionization parameter ( u ) and electron density .",
    "we compare the observed values with a grid of cloudy computations for agn broad line emission @xcite .",
    "the models assumed a total column density @xmath12 @xmath13 and a standard agn continuum ( model 323 of @xcite ) .",
    "figure 2 shows that all trends passing from population b towards population a _",
    "consistently suggest a decrease in u and an increase in @xmath14 ( from log(u ) @xmath8 @xmath151 to @xmath151.5 , log(@xmath14 ) @xmath8 9.5 , canonical value from agn photoionization models to log(u ) @xmath8 @xmath152 to @xmath152.5 , log(@xmath14 ) @xmath8 11.5 _ ) .",
    "notably , the density sensitive line ratio i()/i ( ) ( almost independent of u for log(u ) @xmath2 @xmath150.5 ) indicates that @xmath16 ( ) @xmath8 10.5  11 towards the nlsy1 domain .",
    "these considerations quantify a general trend which is _ very appreciable _ in the spectra of agn with different balmer line widths ( see fig .",
    "2 of @xcite ) and which has been systematically ignored in photoionization computations .",
    "it is probably the origin of our inability to explain some line ratios in quasar spectra @xcite and is obviously a zeroth - order result .",
    "our earlier comparison of  and  properties motivated us to suggest that high and low ionization lines are not emitted in the same region , at least in population a sources @xcite .",
    "why is orientation important and why , at the same time , can it not account for all of the phenomenology ?",
    "important evidence in favor of orientation effects in rq agn involves    profile comparisons @xcite .",
    "some nlsy1 sources such as i zw 1 show a  profile that is almost completely blueshifted relative to a very narrow .",
    "this robust observational result is easily explained in terms of : ( 1 ) a high - ionization wind emitting  and ( 2 ) an optically thick disk emitting . the disk will obscure the opposite ( receding ) side of the high - ionization outflow @xcite .",
    "not all nlsy1 show large amplitude blueshifts but the currently observed range is from 0 to @xmath155000 .",
    "nlsy1 also show low w ( ) @xcite .",
    "the rarity of large amplitude  blueshifts points toward a role for orientation since  shifts are expected to be strongly orientation dependent in a disk + wind scenario .    in principle , it is possible to ascribe low w ( ) , w ( ) and w ( ) to an orientation dependent `` blue bump '' that amplifies the uv / optical continua and whose contribution to the continua increases with decreasing inclination @xcite .",
    "however , this assumption is rather _ ad hoc _ and can not easily account for the increase of  in sources with narrower fwhm ( ) . in that scenario  should remain constant because  and  would be similarly affected by the amplified continuum unless  and  are both , but differently , anisotropic @xcite .",
    "we remark that the observed  increase appears to be mainly due to a decrease in w ( ) towards the nlsy1 domain .",
    "this has been interpreted as the effect of collisional suppression of  @xcite implying an increase in electron density .",
    "the correlation between -sensitive i()/i ( )  ratio and fwhm ( ) also can not be explained in terms of orientation .",
    "physical conditions must change significantly along the agn main sequence .",
    "further difficulties for an orientation - only hypothesis may involve the range of  luminosity observed among pg quasars @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this issue needs reconsideration also because the  emitting region in several seyfert galaxies shows a bipolar structure @xcite , a result that suggests a strong orientation dependence .",
    "e1 shows us that the diversity of agn properties can be organized on the basis of a set of parameters involving : , fwhm ( ) ,  and  line shift .",
    "apart from the reasons outlined above , it is reasonable to infer that orientation alone would be unlikely to account for the e1 correlations because we would expect to find an overlapping domain for _ all _ rq and rl agn . a distinct rl sequence , if it exists , is apparently displaced from the rq one .",
    "e1 suggests that it begins near fwhm()@xmath84000  @xcite .",
    "our bg92 dominated sample suggests that rq sources become rare above fwhm ( ) @xmath86000  while rl are common from 4000 to , at least , 8000 .",
    "support for a rq - rl displacement comes from the detection of a strong  line in bllac with fwhm()@xmath84000  @xcite which should be a near pole - on rl source .",
    "the presence of the soft x - ray excess as one of the principal correlates in e1 suggests that the eddington ratio ( i.e. , the ratio l / m ) may be the most important physical parameter driving e1 , as well as the main factor accounting for the rq and rl sequence displacement @xcite .",
    "we often refer to the l / m ratio rather than the eddington ratio ( ratio between the bolometric and eddington luminosities = dimensionless accretion rate @xmath17 ) because we rely , in this context , on independent observational measurements for both l and m. x - ray variability determination of m for a few agn @xcite suggests an anti - correlation between l / m and fwhm ( ) .",
    "figure [ fig03 ] shows the best current observational evidence for the anti - correlation between dimensionless accretion rate and fwhm ( ) .",
    "it involves the sources with most accurate reverberation and/or x - ray variability based black hole mass determination .",
    "sources like ngc 4051 and 4151 show a transient broad line component , which at some epochs is completely absent in unpolarized light ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . fwhm ( ) and x - ray properties for such sources may not allow a reliable mass estimate that is comparable with agn showing a more typical variability pattern . at the other extreme , the two highest @xmath18  radiators , phl 1092 , and iras",
    "13224@xmath153809 show extreme optical properties ( see  [ disc ] for a possible interpretation ) .",
    "the @xcite dataset is obviously biased towards objects that show large amplitude x - ray variability .",
    "only six sources remain in the x - ray sample if we omit them which is too few for a reliable determination of the correlation coefficient .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig03 ] are suggestive with the x - ray based points showing a correlation at a 2@xmath19 confidence level .",
    "if only the six sources are considered , pearson s correlation coefficient r@xmath20  is @xmath21 with a probability p@xmath3 0.04 that uncorrelated points could give rise to the computed r@xmath20 . if all data points are taken into account , r@xmath22 ( p@xmath3 0.02 ) .",
    "other approaches favor a strong correlation between @xmath18  and fwhm ( ) .",
    "modeling of a radiation pressure - driven wind @xcite predicts the relationship between @xmath18 and fwhm ( ) ( shown as the thick line of fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "a rather strong correlation between l / m and fwhm ( ) also emerges using masses derived from reverberation mapping ( @xcite ) ( filled circles and squares in fig .",
    "[ fig03 ] ) .",
    "if all rq and rl objects are considered except the outliers ngc 3227 ( another transient  object ) and ngc 4051 , the correlation coefficient is r@xmath23 -0.75 ( p@xmath3 2@xmath2410@xmath25 ) .",
    "we obtain the following functional relationship by a robust fitting technique ( e.g. , @xcite ) :    @xmath26    where l@xmath27  is the specific luminosity at @xmath3 5000   and fwhm ( ) is expressed in units of 1000 . in order to transform to @xmath18",
    "we assume a constant bolometric correction @xmath28 , appropriate for the typical agn continuum as parameterized by @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18fwhm ( ) best fit is shown in fig , [ fig03 ] as a thin solid line .",
    "a fwhm ( )  l / m correlation in the case of reverberation masses is not surprising since it results in part from circular arguments ( i.e. , fwhm ( ) is used to compute m from reverberation mapping data ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations were carried out assuming : ( 1 ) that distance r , fwhm ( ) and luminosity are randomly distributed and uncorrelated in the observed ranges and ( 2 ) that m is related to the velocity dispersion by the virial relationship : m @xmath1 r v@xmath29 .",
    "observational errors for @xmath30 were assumed to contribute a gaussian scatter with @xmath31 . in approximately 4000 random trials we found a probability p@xmath2 0.05 that a correlation coefficient as large as 0.75 would be obtained . in order to fully circumvent the circularity issue we also assumed that fhwm ( ) does not correlate strongly with either l or m separately ( as noted also by @xcite ) .",
    "optical luminosity appears to be an orthogonal variable with respect to the e1 parameters ( in bg92 it is part of their eigenvector 2 ) .",
    "mass and fwhm ( ) have r@xmath230.48 .",
    "if we simulate data points for which : ( 1 ) the correlation between fwhm ( ) and m falls in the range @xmath32 and ( 2 ) mass and luminosity are not correlated , we obtain a negligible probability that an @xmath330.75 correlation between fwhm ( ) and @xmath30 could occur randomly .",
    "we conclude that the circularity inherent in the mass computation can not fully explain the strength of the observed l / m vs. fwhm ( ) correlation for reverberation masses .",
    "this provides much needed support for a physical relationship between l / m and fwhm ( ) .",
    "given the caveats outlined above ( small numbers of x - ray determined masses ; m(fwhm ) dependence in optical reverberation masses ) , an independent verification of any @xmath18  fwhm ( ) relationship would be best derived from x - ray variability ( braito & marziani , in preparation ) .",
