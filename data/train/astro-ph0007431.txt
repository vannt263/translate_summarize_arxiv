    "it is now largely accepted that absorbed agn play a significant ( and perhaps major ) role in the production of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) above 2 kev ( see gilli et al . , these proceedings ) and should be the site where a large fraction of the energy density of the universe is generated ( fabian and iwasawa , 1999 ) . however , many important questions are still unsolved .",
    "for example , the relationship between narrow and broad line agn in the optical regime and absorbed and unabsorbed agn in the x - ray regime is still unclear , and doubts on the very existence of high luminosity type 2 agn are often cast ( see e.g. halpern , turner and george , 1999 ; akiyama et al . , 2000 ; salvati and maiolino , 2000 ) .",
    "we briefly address these points using the asca hss sample ( della ceca et al . , 1999a and references therein ) and its present agn contents .",
    "although this small sample of identified objects is probably not representative of the whole population , it allows us to glimps the bright ( @xmath0 erg @xmath1 s@xmath2 kev ) population of hard x - ray sources expected to be present in chandra and xmm - newton fields .",
    "to investigate the x - ray spectral properties of the sources , we defined the hardness ratios , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where s , h and m are the observed net counts in the 0.7@xmath52.0 , 2.0@xmath54.0 , and 4.0@xmath510.0 kev energy bands respectively .",
    "in figure 1 we report the position of the sources in the hr1-hr2 plane for identified type 1 and type 2 agn and for the complete asca hss sample , along with the loci expected from a single absorbed power - law model , with energy index and absorbing column density as indicated in the figures ( see della ceca et al .",
    ", 1999b for details ) .",
    "it is worth noting the large spread in hr1 and hr2 displayed by the sources and the departure from the loci of absorbed , single power law spectra ; this implies a more complex broad band ( 0.7 @xmath5 10 kev ) source spectrum and confirms the results previously reported by della ceca et al .",
    ", 1999b who used a pilot sample of 60 asca serendipitous sources .",
    "the new picture that is now emerging is that some of the optically classified type 1 agn seem to have a complex and very flat ( @xmath6 ) 2 - 10 kev spectrum , probably indicative of x - ray absorption .",
    "a similar result has been also obtained independently by the hellas team ( vignali et al . ,",
    "these proceedings ) , based on _",
    "beppo_sax data .",
    "in the  type 2 agn panel \" of figure 1 we have marked ( n. 1 to 4 ) the type 2 agn for which we have enough counts for a more accurate x - ray spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the x - ray spectra of object # 1 and object # 2 are reported in figure 2 .",
    "object # 1 is described by an absorbed power law model with photon index ( @xmath7 ) equal to @xmath8 and absorbing column density ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 @xmath1 ( @xmath11 confidence errors ) .",
    "this object is spectroscopically identified with a narrow line agn at z=0.398 ; at this redshift the intrinsic ( i.e. unabsorbed ) 2@xmath510 kev luminosity is @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 ( @xmath14 = 50 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 ; @xmath15 ) , making this object one of the few high luminosity type 2 agn known to date . the x - ray spectrum of object # 2 is described by the so called  leaky - absorber \" continua with @xmath16 , @xmath17 @xmath1 and uncovered fraction of @xmath18 .",
    "this object is spectroscopically identified with a nearby ( z=0.046 ) seyfert 2 galaxy .",
    "because of its high absorbing column density this object is probably a compton thick system with an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath19 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "full details on these two objects ( e.g. radio , optical and x - ray properties ) will be reported in a forthcoming paper .",
    "objects # 3 and # 4 are described by the  leaky - absorber \" continua plus a narrow line(s ) .",
    "object # 3 is the well known seyfert 2 galaxy ngc 6552 at z=0.026 .",
    "its spectrum requires @xmath20 , @xmath21 @xmath1 , an uncovered fraction of @xmath22 and a narrow gaussian line at @xmath23 kev with an equivalent width of 0.9 kev ; its intrinsic luminosity is @xmath24 erg s@xmath13 ( fukazawa et al . , 1994 ) .",
    "finally , object # 4 was originally classified as a type 2 agn directly from x - ray data and it was subsequently confirmed as such by optical spectroscopy ( della ceca et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "its x - ray spectrum requires @xmath25 , @xmath26 @xmath1 , an unresolved gaussian line at @xmath23 kev with equivalent width of @xmath27 kev and uncovered fraction of @xmath28 ; at the redshift of the object ( z=0.029 ) its intrinsic luminosity is @xmath29 erg s@xmath13 .",
    "these four examples , along with the possible existence of absorbed type 1 agn , show the large diversity of the sources expected to be found in the chandra and xmm - newton fields ."
