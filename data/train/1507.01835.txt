    "in this paper , we have defined some new measures of distances between samples of functions to solve the problem of homogeneity in the context of functional data analysis . combining these measures with the depth functions defined by fraiman - muniz , cuevas - fraiman - muniz and lpez - pintado - romo",
    ", we propose a hypothesis test based on the bootstrap methology and apply it to a number of simulated and real functional data .",
    "our measures shows their effectiveness in detecting differences of magnitudes and shape in some samples generated by gaussian processes , and moreover are able to show heterogeneity for ramsay data , mitochondrial data and the second derivatives tecator data .",
    "it is significant that our methods show homogeneity in the tecator data without differentation , a phenomenon widely dealt with in the literature .",
    "it is also noteworthy that our method improves the rank - test in some cases .",
    "once the concept of depth of a function with regard to a sample is defined , several generalizations appear to be possible .",
    "for example , the sample of tecator data discussed above shows that there is information about homogeneity hidden in the derivatives that can not be directly extracted from the original functions .",
    "hence , it should be interesting to define and describe a unified way to deal with all the depth measures and statistics used in our work when applied at the same time to all the functions and all their derivatives .",
    "it is likely that such a notion would be able to show patterns in the homogeneity of the samples that could not be deduced without differentiation . on the other hand",
    ", it would be also interesting to define some measures that allow us to test at the same time the homogeneity of several samples of functions .",
    "we plan to undertake this task in subsequent work ."
