    "@xcite        on the other hand , in the case of a nonuniform magnetization ( @xmath9 ) , the behavior of @xmath92 is drastically different from the uniform case due to the appearance of long - range spin - triplet paring .",

    "<S> we have investigated the proximity effect in superconductor / ferromagnet junctions in a systematic manner to discuss the relation between the zero energy peak ( zep ) of the local density of states ( ldos ) and spin - triplet odd - frequency paring . by exactly solving the nonlinear usadel equations , we have found that the zep is realized in a wide range of geometrical and material parameters in the case of the noncollinear magnetization . </S>",
    "<S> this strongly suggests the robustness of the zep induced by spin - triplet odd - frequency paring in such systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that the crossover from singlet to triplet paring can be detected by measuring the f layer thickness dependence of the zep height . </S>",
    "<S> further , we show how to observe signatures of spin - triplet odd - frequency paring and the paring crossover by the ldos measurements . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a direct way to experimentally detect signatures of odd - frequency paring state . </S>"
