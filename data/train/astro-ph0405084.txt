    "scalar fields play a central role in modern cosmology in driving inflation of the early universe and describing dark energy of the present epoch.@xmath0 observations predict that our universe contains roughly one - third of dark matter and baryons and two- thirds of dark energy.@xmath1 within the standard friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models it was shown that there exist scaling solutions that are the unique late - time attractors whenever they exist.@xmath2 here , in this paper , we wish to look for scaling solutions in higher - dimensional cosmological models .    in kaluza - klein theories as well as in brane world scenarios ,",
    "our 4d universe is believed to be embedded in a higher - dimensional manifold .",
    "one of these models is the ricci - flat 5d cosmological solutions presented by liu and wesson.@xmath3 this model is 5d ricci - flat , implying that it is empty viewed from 5d .",
    "however , as is known from the induced matter theory,@xmath4 4d einstein equations with matter could be recovered from 5d equations in apparent vacuum .",
    "this approach is guaranteed by campbell s theorem that any solution of the einstein equations in n - dimensions can be locally embedded in a ricci - flat manifold of ( n+1)-dimensions.@xmath5 in section ii , we suppose the 4d induced matter be composed of a perfect fluid and a scalar field . in section iii , we use phase - plane analysis to study the evolutions of the model . in section",
    "iv we study the scaling solution .",
    "section v is a short discussion .",
    "an exact 5d cosmological solution was given firstly by liu and mashhoon in ref .",

    "this solution satisfies the 5d vacuum equation @xmath14 with the three invariants being@xmath15so @xmath13 determines the curvature of the 5d manifold .",
    "the 5d line element in ( [ 5dmatric ] ) contains the 4d one,@xmath16% .   \\label{c}\\]]using this 4d metric",
    "we can calculate the 4d einstein tensor by @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "its non - vanishing components are@xmath19generally speaking , the einstein tensor in ( [ d ] ) can give a 4d effective or induced energy - momentum tensor @xmath20 via @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "in previous works,@xmath23 this energy - momentum tensor was modelled by a perfect fluid with density @xmath24 and pressure @xmath25 , plus a variable cosmological term @xmath26 .",
    "this @xmath26 could be served to describe dark energy . in this paper",
    ", we let the energy - momentum tensor consist of two parts : @xmath27 ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath28 represents a perfect fluid and @xmath29 represents a scalar field .",
    "then , from the 4d conservation laws @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we obtain@xmath32  the hubble parameter @xmath33 and the deceleration parameter @xmath34 should be defined in terms of the proper time as.@xmath35 @xmath36using this we can recover the corresponding friedmann equations as follows:@xmath37where@xmath38",
    "from ( [ 5dmatric ] ) we see that in general we have @xmath39 , so @xmath40 is not the proper time .",
    "this leads to the only difference between our results ( [ f])-([i ] ) and those of the standard frw models .",
    "similar as in ref . 5 , we define @xmath41 and @xmath42 as    @xmath43    for an exponential potential @xmath44 and a spatially flat universe @xmath45 , we find that the evolution equation for @xmath41 and @xmath42 are of the same form as in ref",

    "meanwhile , from ( [ i ] ) , the effective equation of state for the scalar field gives@xmath51    from the analysis of ref . 5 we know that there are five fixed points ( critical points ) corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53 in the plane - autonomous system , including two stable nodes.@xmath54 the two stable nodes represent two possible late - time attractor solutions and , therefore , are of particular physical interest . we list them in the following .",
    "late - time attractor solution dominated by the scalar field alone .",
    "this solution corresponds to the stable node@xmath55for which we have @xmath56 , then we get@xmath57so the universe is dominated by the scalar field alone and expands with a power - law .",
    "it can be shown that if , furthermore , @xmath58 , the universe is accelerating .    ( 2 ) . scaling solution .",
    "it corresponds to the stable node@xmath59for which we have@xmath60so this represents a scaling solution where the dark energy density of the scalar field is proportional to that of the baryons and dark matter .",
    "it is known that in the standard spatially - flat frw models the scaling solution ( [ p ] ) corresponds to a power - law expansion . here",
    "let us check how the universe expands in the 5d model ( [ 5dmatric ] ) .",
    "firstly , by substituting the value of @xmath41 of ( [ p ] ) into its definition in ( [ j ] )  and using ( [ decelerate ] ) , we find that the scalar field @xmath61 can be integrated , giving@xmath62thus we obtain the exponential potential as@xmath63meanwhile , substituting the value of @xmath42 of ( [ p ] ) into its definition in ( [ j ] ) , and then using ( [ v ] ) , we get a constraint between @xmath64 and @xmath65 as@xmath66    consider the 5d metric ( [ 5dmatric ] ) .",
    "the form @xmath67 is invariant under an arbitrary coordinate transformation @xmath68 .",
    "this would enable us to choose the coordinate @xmath10 such that although @xmath40 does not equal to the proper time @xmath69 globally , it can tend to the proper time as @xmath70 .",
    "be aware that in the 4d standard frw models the scaling solution ( [ p ] ) corresponds to the expansion @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus we obtain the late - time approximation of the 5d scaling solution ( [ p ] ) as:@xmath73for @xmath74 , the 5d solution ( [ 5dmatric ] ) reads@xmath75using ( [ t ] ) in ( [ u ] ) , we find@xmath76",
    "in this paper we have used the phase - plane analysis to study the stability of evolution of a 5d cosmological model . from eqs.([t])-([w ] ) we can draw three conclusions :    ( 1 ) .",
    "the scaling solution ( [ p ] ) , as a late - time attractor of the evolution of the universe , is the same in both the 4d frw models and the 5d induced matter theory .",
    "( 2 ) . in the 5d model ( [ t])-([w ] ) , the expansion rate @xmath64 and @xmath33 of ( [ t ] ) seems not rely on the value of @xmath42 . in other words , our 4d universe ,",
    "no matter it is situated on which hypersurface of @xmath42 in the 5d manifold , looks similar and expands with almost the same rate , in late times .",
    "the constant @xmath13 in ( [ u ] ) represents the curvature of the 5d manifold ( see eq.([b ] ) ) .",
    "it is reasonable to believe that @xmath77 may correspond to three different topologies for the 5d manifold ( 5dmatric ) .",
    "however , from ( [ t])-([w ] ) , we find that @xmath13 does not affect @xmath64 and @xmath33 so much in late - times .",
    "( 4 ) . in eq . ( [ t ] ) ,",
    "if @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and our model approaches to the milne model which has no event or particle horizon , and so it is of particular interest .",
    "it was shown@xmath23 that in the early - time of the universe the 5d solution ( [ 5dmatric ] ) deviates from the standard frw models greatly .",
    "for instance it may have a big bounce rather than a big bang and before the bounce the universe is contracting .",
    "meanwhile , the value of the 5d curvature @xmath13 is sensitive for having or not having a bounce .",
    "however , in the late time , we have @xmath81 and the coordinate time @xmath10 gives back to the cosmic time @xmath69 ,  so the bounce model approaches to the frw model . as a late - time attractor , the scaling solution seems not show up noticeable deviations from the standard frw models . further study along this line",
    "is needed to distinguish the two theories .",
