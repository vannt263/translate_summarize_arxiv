    "thermal phase variations are a powerful way to constrain the climate on exoplanets .",
    "such observations have been made for non - transiting short - period planets @xcite , but are most potent when combined with transit and eclipse observations for edge - on systems , because of the additional knowledge of the planet s inclination , mass and radius @xcite .",
    "secondary eclipse depths provide a constraint on the planet s day - side temperature .",
    "thermal phase variations probe the day  night temperature contrast and hence the planet s heat redistribution efficiency .",
    "if the observational cadence and signal - to - noise ratio are sufficiently high , phase variations are also sensitive to the offset between the noon meridian and the planet s hottest local stellar time , hence constraining wind speed and direction .    by considering eclipse depths at a variety of wavelengths for a sample of 24 transiting planets , @xcite estimated their day - side effective temperatures , hence placing a joint constraint on the bond albedo and heat recirculation efficiency of these planets .",
    "that study found that typical hot jupiters exhibit a variety of albedo / recirculation efficiencies , but planets with substellar equilibrium temperatures greater than @xmath4  k all seem to have lower albedo and/or recirculation efficiency .",
    "in other words , the hottest transiting giant planets have a qualitatively different climate than the merely hot jupiters , but it is not known whether this is due to a difference in albedo , circulation , or both .",
    "direct measurements of hot jupiter geometric albedos from optical secondary eclipse observations span more than an order of magnitude and do not resolve this degeneracy .    in this paper",
    ", we break the albedo - recirculation degeneracy for wasp-12b @xcite , one of the very hottest known exoplanets , with a day - side temperature of @xmath5  k : the amplitude of thermal phase variations is a direct measure of the planet s day - night temperature contrast and hence heat transport efficiency . if the night - side temperature is high , then the planet s albedo must be exceedingly low to be consistent with its high day - side temperature .",
    "if , on the other hand , the night - side temperature is low , then the planet has an albedo in the tens of percent .",
    "wasp-12b has been a fascinating planet since its discovery .",
    "the discrepant timing of its secondary eclipse indicated that the planet had a slight eccentricity @xcite , but subsequent eclipse @xcite and radial velocity @xcite observations have all but ruled this out .",
    "nevertheless , the planet s short - period orbit ( 1.1 days ; just outside its star s roche limit ) and inflated radius ( 1.8 @xmath6 ) led to the prediction that it is tidally distorted @xcite , and undergoing roche - lobe overflow followed by accretion onto its host star @xcite .",
    "the putative early ingress of an ultraviolet transit observed by @xcite seems to support this prediction , but may also be explained in terms of a leading bow shock from material streaming off the planet @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite used the wavelength - dependance of mid - infrared eclipse depths of @xcite and @xcite to constrain the atmospheric composition of wasp-12b , and found it has a carbon to oxygen ratio ( c / o ) greater than unity , unlike solar system planets , or the assumed composition of extrasolar planets .",
    "those findings rested heavily on the relative eclipse depths at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "our observations of eclipses and transits at these wavebands should be able to reinforce or rule out the high c / o scenario .",
    "we acquired observations of wasp-12 ( spectral type f9v ) with irac @xcite on the spitzer space telescope @xcite at 3.6 @xmath0 m ( 2010 nov 1718 ) and 4.5 @xmath0 m ( 2010 dec 1112 ) as part of the warm mission .",
    "we used the sub - array mode and acquired images every 2  s ( 1.92  s effective exposure time ) , observing the system for approximately 1.3 days at each waveband , from slightly before a secondary eclipse to shortly after the following secondary eclipse .",
    "this yields 902 data cubes ( 64 frames of @xmath7 pixels ) at each waveband .",
    "due to a scheduling error , we did not observe all of the second eclipse s egress at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "this does not severely affect our science objectives since we simultaneously fit both eclipses at a given wavelength ; even at 3.6 @xmath0 m we have nearly two full eclipse lightcurves to work with .",
    "we use the bcd files and convert mjy / str to electron counts by multiplying the flux values by _ _",
    "gain__@xmath8_exptime_/_fluxconv _ , using parameter values from the header of the fits files .",
    "we use the _ bmjd_obs _ and _ framtime _ parameter values to compute the bjd time at the middle of every exposure .",
    "we start by considering the pixel - by - pixel time - series for each 64-frame data cube , replacing _",
    "s with the pixel s median over that data cube ; if the entire time - series for a given pixel is bad , it is flagged as a bad pixel and ignored in the subsequent analysis . at 4.5 @xmath0 m , the first row of pixels ( @xmath9 ) is consistently bad .",
    "@xcite noted that _",
    "warm spitzer _ sub - array data cubes exhibit a frame - dependent background flux . at 3.6 @xmath0 m ,",
    "the first and 58th frames are consistent background outliers ( both high ) , and there is a clear drop in background flux throughout each data cube ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at 4.5 @xmath0 m , the same two frames ( 1 and 58 ) are outliers ( high and low backgrounds , respectively ) , and",
    "there is a slight _ increase _ in background flux throughout each data cube .",
    "we elect to ignore the 1@xmath10 and 58@xmath11 frames of each data cube ( 3% of our data ) .",
    "to correct for the gradual change in background flux , we perform initial background subtraction on each frame of the data cube using the idl routine ` mmm ` and excluding the 16 central pixels of the detector ( those closest to the star ) .",
    "we then perform a two - step sigma clipping on each pixel s time - series , replacing @xmath12 outliers by the pixel s median in that data cube .",
    "the sigma - clipping at the pixel level affects 0.028% and 0.035% of our science time - series data at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , respectively .    to determine the centroid of our target",
    ", we first identify the brightest of the central 16 pixels in each frame , then fit a 2d gaussian to the 7x7 pixel box centered on this brightest pixel using the idl routine ` gauss2dfit ` .",
    ", commensurate correlated noise as measured using @xmath13 ( see first section  4.1 ) , and consistent astrophysical parameters . ]",
    "we perform aperture photometry on the individual frames of the data cubes using the idl routine ` aper ` with a sky annulus of 712 pixels in radius ( as did * ? ? ?",
    "* who observed the same system with the same instrument ) .",
    "since we perform an initial background subtraction early in our reduction pipeline ( see above ) , our results are not very sensitive to changes in the sky annulus",
    ". we verified that nudging the inner / outer radius of the annulus by 12 pixels does not significantly affect the goodness - of - fit or astrophysical parameters .",
    "bad pixels are ignored in the background estimation ; images with a bad pixel within the aperture are ignored . to determine the optimal aperture for our analysis",
    ", we re - run our entire data reduction and analysis pipeline for a range of apertures , from 1.5 to 5.0 pixels , in increments of 0.5 pixel .",
    "we find that for both wavebands , the root - mean - squared scatter in the residuals are minimized for an aperture of 2.5 pixels , which we therefore adopt for the remainder of our study .",
    "this is smaller than the apertures of 3.75 and 4.0 pixels ( for 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m images , respectively ) used by @xcite . while using a larger aperture",
    "might reduce the photon - counting uncertainty , a small aperture makes it easier to correct for our dominant source of systematic uncertainty , the intra - pixel sensitivity variations described in section 3.2 . since the _ spitzer _ heater cycling was different for the two observing campaigns ( see section  3.2 ) , it is possible that the nature of this systematic was different for the @xcite observations .",
    "lastly , we perform an iterative 4@xmath14 clipping on the flux time - series , removing any outliers .",
    "this affects 0.01% and 0.02% of the science time - series data at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , respectively .",
    "the 3.6 @xmath0 m cut is more generous because of the greater systematic flux variations , as described below .",
    "the raw photometry is shown in figure  [ wasp_12_raw ] .",
    "( note that we perform all of our analysis on the unbinned data , but we bin the data for plotting . ) the transits are easy to spot in the middle of the observations .",
    "the eclipses and phase variations are also visible by eye at 4.5 @xmath0 m . for the 3.6 @xmath0 m light curve , the first eclipse and",
    "the phase variations are difficult to distinguish from detector systematics by eye .",
    "we estimate the system flux in mjy by converting back to mjy / str and using the pixel scale parameter values , _",
    "pxscal1 _ and _ pxscal2_. our system fluxes 23.0(5 )  mjy and 14.7(1 )  mjy , at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , respectively are approximately 10% lower than those of @xcite , even when we adopt their larger apertures .",
    "@xcite expected the absolute photometric precision of irac to be better than 10% .",
    "+     as part of our _ warm spitzer _ observations , we also obtained mapping data in sub - array mode for wasp-12 , at each 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , immediately following the time series described above .",
    "for the mapping data we acquired images every 0.4  s ( 0.36  s effective exposure time ) ; we obtained 450 data cubes in each waveband .",
    "the purpose of these data was to map the central four pixels of the detector by scanning over them in 0.2-pixel and 0.1-pixel increments in the @xmath15- and @xmath16-directions , respectively .",
    "the data reduction for the mapping data is identical to that for the science lightcurve , except that we stack the frames of each data cube using a pixel - by - pixel median .",
    "aperture photometry is performed on these 450 stacked images rather than on the individual frames .",
    "this is necessary because of the shorter integration times for these data .",
    "( we also tried this data reduction performing photometry cube - by - cube rather than frame - by - frame on our phase curve data .",
    "our best - fit models parameters were consistent using this approach , but the detector systematics were harder to correct for , leading to larger parameter uncertainties . )    the pixel - level sigma - clipping affects 0.01% of both the 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m mapping data .",

    "the phase variations have a sinusoidal shape , corresponding to a sinusoidal longitudinal brightness profile for the planet @xcite .",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite all predict that the projected area of wasp-12b should vary by approximately 10% ( peak - to - trough ) due to its prolate shape , whether it is modeled as a prolate ellipsoid or a partially - filled roche lobe .",

    "our best model in this regard is : @xmath49 where @xmath25 and @xmath27 are the semi - amplitudes of diurnal and ellipsoidal phase variations , respectively , and @xmath50 is the phase angle ( @xmath51 at superior conjunction , @xmath52 at inferior conjunction ) .",

    "it may be possible to reconcile these two measurements if the atmospheric composition is grossly different at the day - night terminator than near the sub - stellar point .",
    "the best - fit ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 @xmath0 m are consistent with the predicted amplitude of @xmath47 , but as one can see from the relative uncertainty ( or from glancing at figure  [ wasp_12_slope_ch1 ] ) , they are not robustly detected : the @xmath59 , residuals and remaining astrophysical parameters do not change significantly if @xmath27 is set to zero .    as shown in figure  5 , however , we clearly detect power at 4.5 @xmath0 m in the second cosine harmonic , @xmath104 , consistent with the prediction of ellipsoidal variations due to the prolate shape of the planet @xcite .",
    "the semi - amplitude of the variations , however , is @xmath81 using either decorrelation or polynomial ipsv - removal , approximately @xmath105 the predicted value .    since ellipsoidal variations are primarily a geometrical effect , it is difficult to understand how the measured amplitude could be be so different at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the upper layers of the atmosphere should be more distorted ; the deeper layers more spherical . the relative strengths of ellipsoidal variations at the two wavebands imply that the 4.5 @xmath0 m flux is originating from much higher up in the planet s atmosphere than the 3.6 @xmath0 m flux .",
    "the simplest way to do this is for the atmosphere to have a greater opacity at 4.5 @xmath0 m than 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "but the relative transit depths indicate exactly the opposite , as described above and shown in figure  [ burrows_transit ] .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that detector systematics still present after ipsv - removal attenuate the ellipsoidal signal at 3.6 @xmath0 m or enhance it at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "the raw photometry shown in figure  1 implies that the 4.5 @xmath0 m light curve is more trustworthy of the two .",

    "m phase variations ( top panel ) can be modeled as a geometrical component due to the planet s changing projected area ( middle panel ) and a thermal component due to longitudinal variations in the planet s brightness ( bottom panel ) . for the red lines all of the @xmath113 power is attributed to the planet s ellipsoidal shape ; this hypothesis can be ruled out by the transit morphology ( figure  9 ) .",
    "the blue lines result from assuming that the planet is spherical in shape ; this hypothesis leads to unphysical brightness variations on the planet .",
    "the green lines show the middle - road : most of the @xmath113 power is due to the planet s shape , but the thermal component also contributes a bit .",
    "note that this _ a posteriori _ analysis has limitations : in our astrophysical model , the thermal and ellipsoidal components of phase variations were added , while strictly speaking the planet s intensity and cross - sectional area should be multiplied.,width=317 ]    if we interpret all of the power in the second cosine harmonic as being due to the changing cross - sectional area of the planet ( the red curves in figure  [ ellipsoidal ] ) , we may estimate the planet s aspect ratio as @xmath114 the predicted aspect ratio for the planet is @xmath115 , while the aspect ratio for a roche lobe is @xmath116 .",
    "it is worth noting that a planet with an aspect ratio of @xmath117 would have a 13% larger projected area at the start and end of transit as compared to transit center , resulting in a w - shaped transit , in the absence of stellar limb - darkening ( note that this differs from changes in transit morphology due to an oblate planet discussed in * ? ? ?",
    "since the transit depth of wasp-12b is approximately 1% , this shape - induced transit effect would come in at the @xmath118 level and might be detectable in our current data . in figure  [ transit_morphology ]",

    "we model thermal phases using only first harmonics ( @xmath127 and @xmath128 ) , while our parameterization of ellipsoidal variations is a second harmonic ( @xmath129 ) .",
    "these functions are by definition orthogonal , so it is not surprising that our conclusions about thermal phase variations ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) described below are not significantly affected by the presence or absence of ellipsoidal variations discussed above .    that said , the amplitude and offset we obtain for the thermal phase variations depends on which ipsv - removal scheme we use .",
    "unfortunately , it is not clear how to perform a direct model comparison between decorrelation and polynomial fits using the bic .",
    "the gaussian decorrelation can be thought of as having a large number of free parameters and a somewhat smaller number of additional constraining equations , but it is not obvious how to estimate its degrees of freedom . as discussed by @xcite , the point - by - point de - correlation does a great job of removing the short - term jitter and long - term detector drift , but may also remove any longer - term astrophysical signal .",
    "( this did not interfere with their goal of searching for transits . )",
    "insofar as diurnal phase variations are the most gradual astrophysical signal in our study , it is not surprising that it is the most dependent on ipsv - removal .",
    "the polynomial fit leads to @xmath59 values at least as good and sometimes significantly better than the gaussian decorrelation .",
    "more importantly , the scatter in the residuals on the critical 21 minute timescale is lower for the polynomial fits , indicating that this method is doing a better job of removing correlated noise .",
    "our 4.5 @xmath0 m pixel sensitivity map obtained from gaussian decorrelation ( top right panel of figure  3 ) shows a valley at @xmath130 ; this does nt follow the usual pattern of sensitivity decreasing towards pixel edges .",
    "( note that we observe the same ripples in sensitivity as @xcite , but those occur on a much smaller spatial scale and exhibit a much smaller amplitude than the @xmath130 valley . )",
    "finally , the middle - left panel of figure  3 suggests that the decorrelation method has over - corrected the 3.6 @xmath0 m system flux near superior - conjunction : the eclipse bottoms which should be flat since the planet is hidden from view slope upward towards the central transit .",
    "we therefore argue that the decorrelation has filtered out much of the phase variations along with the systematics and adopt the polynomial - fitted thermal phase parameters in what follows .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the hemispheric effective temperatures to be @xmath131  k and @xmath132  k , where the uncertainties include an estimate of systematic errors in going from brightness temperatures to effective temperatures .",

    "] note that our 1d radiative transfer models used for interpreting transit and eclipse spectra are cloud - free and have an albedo lower than this inferred value .",
    "space - based optical secondary eclipse depths have been measured for a handful of hot jupiters .",
    "if the planet s equilibrium temperature is sufficiently low , such measurements provide an unambiguous estimate of geometric albedo , @xmath139 : @xmath140 for hd  209458b @xcite , @xmath141 for kepler-7b @xcite , @xmath142 for kepler-17b @xcite , @xmath143 for koi-196b @xcite , and @xmath144 for tres-2b @xcite . acknowledging that wasp-12b is more than 1000  k hotter than any of those planets , a bond albedo of 0.25 is well within the observed range for hot jupiters .",
    "assuming gray albedo and a lambertian scattering phase function ( @xmath145 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the reflected - light secondary eclipse of wasp-12b should have a depth of @xmath146 , comparable to current ground - based precision for this target . in practice , most planets exhibit an opposition surge ( making them disproportionately bright at superior conjunction ) and rayleigh scattering , so the actual contrast ratio in blue optical wavebands is likely more favorable than this estimate",

    "insofar as radiative times increase monotonically with pressure , we may therefore expect the 3.6 @xmath0 m phase variations to be muted compared to the 4.5 @xmath0 m phase variations , and the phase offset should be greater at the shorter wavelength ( e.g. , figure 9 of * ? ? ?",
    "the hot - spot offset is @xmath147 east of the sub - stellar point at 3.6 @xmath0 m . while not as extreme as @xmath148-andromeda  b @xcite , it is difficult to reconcile our large phase offset and large amplitude at 3.6 @xmath0m.m phase curve to doppler beaming , which would produce a peak in flux when the star is moving towards us , a quarter period before superior conjunction @xcite .",
    "the expected amplitude of this signal , however , is only @xmath149 on the rayleigh - jeans tail of the star . ]",
    "it is worth noting , however , that there are highly - correlated residuals near the purported peak ( @xmath150  day after transit ) which may be partially responsible for the large offset .",
    "on the other hand , we find that the 4.5 @xmath0 m phase amplitude and offset , @xmath151 e , are consistent with a @xcite model with heat transport efficiency of @xmath152 . to put this in context , phase variations and eclipse timing offset of hd  189733b at 8 @xmath0 m",
    "indicate @xmath153 @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted that the day - side temperatures of the hottest short - period giant planets are very close to the theoretical upper limit of no albedo and no recirculation .",
    "this was in contrast to run - of - the - mill hot jupiters ( e.g. , hd  189733b , hd  209458b ) , which exhibit a variety of albedos / recirculation efficiencies , albeit consistent with generally low albedos ( @xmath154 ) . in a statistical study of _ kepler",
    "_ planetary candidates , @xcite also found generally low albedos for hot jupiters based on optical secondary eclipses .",
    "the amplitude of the phase variations for wasp-12b depends on the details of the systematics correction , but for reasons stated at the start of section  5.4 we favor the polynomial fit , which implies a large day  night temperature contrast , and a non - zero bond albedo .",
    "this suggests that the difference between the hottest short - period giant planets and other hot jupiters is not albedo , but recirculation efficiency .",
    "( differences in albedo may very well explain the differences in day - side effective temperature amongst the remaining hot jupiters , however . )",
    "what could make the hottest of hot jupiters poor heat re - circulators ?",
    "there are two classes of solutions : decreasing either the planet s characteristic advective frequency , or radiative timescale .",
    "_ more magnetic drag : _ assuming these planets have magnetic fields , the movement of ionized alkali metals through the field produces drag that is collisionaly imparted on the dominant neutral species ( presumably h and he ) .",
    "hotter planets should have more ionized species , more drag and therefore a harder time advecting heat to their night side @xcite .",
    "because of the non - linear dependence of ionization on temperature , this effect could lead to sudden changes in dynamical regime as one considers increasingly hot planets .",
    "the scaling relations of @xcite indicate that the temperature above which magnetic drag severely curtails heat transport is inversely related to the planet s magnetic field strength .",
    "even the weakest field they considered in their study , 3  gauss , would result in very low recirculation efficiency for a planet as hot as wasp-12b .",
    "_ shorter radiative times : _ following the argument of @xcite , the radiative relaxation time of a parcel of gas scales as @xmath155 @xcite .",
    "but zonal wind speeds may also increase with the amplitude of the diurnal forcing .",
    "if one assumes that the wind speeds have a fixed mach number , they should scale as @xmath156 , and therefore the advective time should scale as @xmath157 ( a more detailed scaling analysis leads to the same temperature dependence ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the stronger dependence on temperature of radiative time compared to advective time implies that all things being equal hotter planets should be less efficient at balancing their day  night temperature contrast .",
    "this effect should cause the heat transport efficiency to gradually decrease as one considers increasingly hot planets .    _ weaker greenhouse :",
    "_ atmospheric opacity is typically greater at the thermal wavelengths of emergent radiation than at the visible wavelengths of incident radiation . for the hottest planets , the blackbody peak of thermal emission approaches the peak of their host star ,",
    "so the opacities of the incoming and outgoing streams converge . in that limit",
    ", one expects the thermal photosphere and the optical deposition depth to be one and the same : thermal radiation should escape the atmosphere just as easily as the incoming stellar radiation came in .",
    "as with the scalings above , this effect should lead to gradually decreasing recirculation efficiency as a function of increasing planet temperature .",
    "more observations of thermal eclipses and phase variations for hot jupiters especially those near the @xmath158  k transition will be necessary to distinguish between the magnetohydrodynamic and the radiative timescale arguments .",
    "we obtained _ warm spitzer _ full - orbit phase observations of wasp-12b at 3.6 and 4.5 @xmath0 m , allowing us to measure the transit depths , eclipse depths , thermal and ellipsoidal phase variations at both wavelengths .",
    "we are able to push _ warm spitzer _",
    "photometry to within 1020% of the poisson limit , but there are two important caveats :    \\a ) removing intra - pixel sensitivity variations ( ipsvs ) from the data is inherently a model - dependent endeavor .",
    "this means that we must specify not only an ipsv model , but also an astrophysical model before getting close to the quoted precision .",
    "the simultaneous fit to astrophysical and systematic effects makes it difficult to produce a `` clean '' lightcurve independent of astrophysical assumptions .",
    "for example , we obtain very different thermal phase variation parameters depending on how we correct for systematics , and it is difficult to distinguish between these scenarios based solely on goodness - of - fit . instead , we must resort to a number indirect clues as to which ipsv - removal scheme is more trustworthy .",
    "we find that wasp-12b exhibits large - amplitude thermal phases indicative of poor day  night heat transport and a moderate bond albedo but also an unexpectedly large phase offset at 3.6 @xmath0 m .",
    "we do not detect ellipsoidal variations at 3.6 @xmath0 m , while we detect an unexpectedly strong signal at 4.5 @xmath0 m .",
    "this leads us to two possible hypotheses :    \\1 ) if we take the 4.5  @xmath0 m ellipsoidal variations at face value , we find : deeper transits at 3.6 @xmath0 m as compared to 4.5 @xmath0 m , inconsistent with either solar or enhanced co models ; eclipse depths consistent with previous studies .",
    "if the 4.5 @xmath0 m ellipsoidal variations are astrophysical in nature , it indicates that the planet is far more distorted than predicted , and exhibits a bright terminator . in this scenario , the 3.6 @xmath0 m",
    "ellipsoidal variations are attenuated due to detector systematics , possibly throwing off the 3.6 @xmath0 m transit depth as well .",
    "\\2 ) if instead we presume that the 4.5 @xmath0 m ellipsoidal variations are caused by detector systematics and set them to zero the null hypothesis we find : transit depths consistent with a solar composition and short atmospheric scale height at the planet s terminator ; eclipse depths consistent with a solar composition and a modest temperature inversion ; ellipsoidal variations in line with predictions .",
    "the null hypothesis is attractive in its simplicity , but requires that we were very unlucky ; follow - up",
    "_ warm spitzer _ observations would have different systematics ( the psf would fall on different regions of the pixels ) and could settle the question of ellipsoidal variations .",
    "it is likely that near infrared transit spectroscopy could break the composition degeneracy , or at least determine the atmospheric structure of wasp-12b ; if the planet has a short scale - height at the terminator it will lend credence to the null hypothesis .",
    "further optical transit photometry will be useful in pinning down the transmission spectrum and refining geometrical parameters ; if @xmath159 , then the planet could very well be more distorted than predicted , making the large ellipsoidal variations more plausible .",
    "optical eclipse measurements from the ground or from space might confirm the moderate albedo of the planet .",
    "the planet is hypothesized to be losing mass to its host star .",
