    "proper motion catalogs have historically been the primary sources for the identification of stellar systems in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "while star distances are ultimately determined from measurements of annual parallactic motions , these require a substantial investment of time and effort .",
    "parallax programs are thus most successful when they rely on input lists of objects already suspected to be nearby . since a large proper motion is an indicator of proximity , high proper motion ( hpm ) stars have always been prime targets for parallax programs .",
    "it is a historical fact that the vast majority of the stars now known to be in the `` solar neighborhood '' ( @xmath5 pc ) , and recorded in compendiums such as the _ third catalog of nearby stars _ @xcite hereafter the cns3 , or the nasa _ nstars database _ , have first been identified as hpm stars .",
    "perhaps the most important feature of the nearby star census is the fact that it is dominated by low - luminosity red dwarfs , with absolute magnitudes @xmath6 .",
    "the vast majority of the `` solar neighborhood '' red dwarfs are therefore not listed in the hipparcos catalog @xcite which has a limiting magnitude @xmath7 . on the other hand ,",
    "most nearby red dwarfs are expected to be detected on the photographic plates of the large schmidt telescope surveys ( e.g. poss - i , poss - ii , ses , aao ) which typically reach @xmath8 . because nearby red dwarfs have optical colors similar to those of distant giants or dust - reddened stars , they are most easily and reliably identified by their large proper motions .",
    "in fact , the main strength of proper motion surveys is that they can locate nearby stars independently of their physical appearance ( color , luminosity ) .",
    "one caveat is that a high proper motion is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for a star to be nearby .",
    "nearby stars can have small proper motions if their motion vector is pointing toward , or away from the sun @xcite .",
    "conversely , distant stars can have large proper motions if their transverse motion relative to the sun is also large , such as is typically the case for stars on galactic halo orbits .",
    "hence the dilemma : the completeness of a nearby star census based on proper motion surveys increases as the proper motion limit is set to smaller values , but decreasing the proper motion limit also greatly increases the number of distant stars that make it into the survey , which can be viewed as `` contaminants '' for parallax programs aimed at finding the nearest stars .    the earlier proper motion catalogs of @xcite and @xcite had relatively high proper motion limits ( @xmath9 yr@xmath1 - 0.5@xmath10 yr@xmath1 ) and together contained a little over 2500 stars , a manageable size for parallax programs .",
    "however , later catalogs became increasingly larger , bringing the number of known high proper motion stars to sizes difficult to manage .",
    "the catalogs by @xcite and @xcite contain 11,000 + stars with @xmath11 yr@xmath1 , while the famous `` nltt catalog '' of @xcite , the main reference in the field for 25 years , contains over 58,000 stars with @xmath12 yr@xmath1 , down to a magnitude @xmath13 .",
    "these large catalogs provide several times more targets than can be handled by existing ground - based parallax programs @xcite .",
    "to illustrate this , one need only consider the yale catalog of trigonometric parallaxes @xcite , which compiles all published ground - based parallax measurements prior to 1995 , and which contains data for only 1501 stars fainter than @xmath14 .",
    "given these limitations , most efforts at finding nearby stars have focused on a subsample of the nltt , the `` lhs catalog '' @xcite , which basically lists the 4470 nltt stars with the largest proper motions ( @xmath15 yr@xmath1 ) .",
    "it is however possible to mine large proper motion catalogs for nearby stars , by using secondary distance estimators such as photometric or spectroscopic distance moduli .",
    "photometry and spectroscopy are more readily obtained for large samples of objects than parallax measurements , although they provide much less reliable distance estimates .",
    "but even approximate distance moduli can be used to trim a large proper motion sample down to a more manageable list of probable nearby stars .",
    "luyten himself devoted substantial efforts to obtaining photographic magnitudes and colors for all the stars in his catalogs , though these were sometimes only approximate .",
    "while his @xmath16,@xmath17 photographic magnitude system was used to identify some nearby objects @xcite , its usefulness in estimating distance moduli for the ubiquitous red dwarfs was found to be very limited in practice @xcite .",
    "more photometric / spectroscopic data was needed , and the follow - up vri photometric survey of @xmath18 nltt stars with @xmath19 yr@xmath1 @xcite proved successful in identifying 295 new solar neighborhood candidates .",
    "a major advance came with the availability of accurate infra - red jhk@xmath20 photometry from the 2 micron all - sky survey ( 2mass ) . in a series of papers ( `` meeting the cool neighbors .",
    "i .- ix . '' ) , i. n. reid and colleagues used data from the 2mass _ second incremental release _ to systematically mine the nltt for nearby stars . in the first paper of their series , a combination of luyten s estimated photographic red magnitude ( @xmath17 ) with accurate @xmath21 magnitudes from the _",
    "2mass second incremental release _ was succesfully used to identify a subsample of candidate red dwarfs within 20 pc of the sun @xcite .",
    "distance moduli were calculated based on the 2mass magnitudes and follow - up bvri photometry @xcite , and spectroscopy @xcite of the nltt candidates .",
    "unfortunately , positions quoted in the nltt catalog often contain large errors @xcite ; this proved a major impediment , as 2mass counterparts of nltt stars sometimes could not be found , or were mismatched .",
    "these problems were mitigated by the use of the _ revised nltt _ ( or rnltt ) catalog of @xcite , which provide re - estimates of nltt positions , and through the use of additional selection criteria ( e.g. color - color cuts ) to identify and reject mismatches @xcite .    with these successes",
    ", the nearby star census appears now to be only limited by the nltt catalog itself .",
    "apart from the issues of the accuracy of its photometry and astrometry , the nltt has long been known to be significantly incomplete in some parts of the sky @xcite .",
    "the nearby star census would benefit from a more complete proper motion survey , but also from an expansion to fainter magnitudes , and especially from an expansion to smaller proper motions , the nltt itself being limited to stars with @xmath22 yr@xmath1 .",
    "this is why the new lspm - north catalog , as a replacement of the old nltt , promises to improve significantly on nearby stars surveys .",
    "the lspm - north catalog @xcite is the product of a massive data mining of the digitized sky surveys ( dss ) with a specialized software ( superblink ) that uses image subtraction algorithms to identify moving and variable objects .",
    "the lspm - north lists 61,976 stars with proper motions @xmath23 down to v=21.0 , and is estimated to be @xmath24 complete down to @xmath25 .",
    "besides being marginally deeper , and significantly more complete than the nltt , the lspm is also much more accurate , with positions within @xmath26 at the 2000.0 epoch , and optical photographic magnitudes to @xmath27mags obtained from the usno - b1.0 catalog of @xcite .",
    "the lspm - north catalog also provides counterparts from the 2mass _ all sky point source catalog _",
    "@xcite when they exist . by being deeper , more accurate , and more complete",
    ", the lspm - north catalog supersedes the nltt in all respects ( though only at northern declinations for now ) .",
    "the use of the 2mass _ all sky point source catalog _ also offers the opportunity to expand significantly upon the reid _",
    "analysis , which was restricted to the fraction of the sky covered by the 2mass _ second incremental release_.    the first paper of this series presents our initial efforts at identifying nearby stars in the lspm - north catalog , specifically the identification of new candidate main - sequence dwarfs within 33pc of the sun . data are found in the literature for all lspm stars that have published trigonometric parallaxes or photometric / spectroscopic distance moduli .",
    "a calibration of the @xmath28 $ ] relationship in the @xmath29 system of the lspm - north catalog provides the identification of 1672 new candidate nearby stars with distances estimated to be within 33pc of the sun .",
    "identification of nearby white dwarfs from the lspm - north catalog will be detailed in the second paper of this series , while a subsequent paper will address the problem of identifying nearby metal - pool subdwarfs ( lpine , _ in preparation _ ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows :  2 describes the calibration of the @xmath30 color magnitude relationship for main sequence dwarfs , which is used to estimate photometric distance moduli of lspm stars .",
    " 3 gives complete lists of nearby dwarfs listed in the lspm catalog for which there exists published trigonometric parallaxes or photometric / spectroscopic distance moduli , and presents the selection of new candidate stars within 33pc .",
    " 4 analyzes the current completeness level of the nearby star census in terms of limiting magnitude and proper motion selection .",
    "the main results are summarized in the conclusion (  5 ) .",
    "photometric distance moduli ( m - m)@xmath31 for all main sequence lspm - north stars are estimated based on a color - magnitude relation in the ( v , v - j ) color - magnitude system used in the lspm - north catalog .",
    "an absolute magnitude - color calibration @xmath32 is calibrated with a subsample of 3,104 lspm stars for which there exist reliable trigonometric parallax ( @xmath33 ) measurements .",
    "most calibration stars are selected from the hipparcos and tycho catalog @xcite , and from the yale catalog of trigonometric parallaxes @xcite  hereafter ypc .",
    "calibration stars are selected based on the following criteria : [ 1 ] the star has a measured @xmath33 with an estimated accuracy better than 10% , [ 2 ] the star has @xmath34 , placing it within 40pc of the sun .",
    "[ 3 ] the star does not have a companion within @xmath35 .",
    "the first constraint ensures that absolute magnitudes can be calculated from apparent magnitudes with an accuracy of @xmath36mag .",
    "the second constraint is used because our calibration is to be applied in determining distances for nearby stars , and we wish to compare objects of a given color class over a similar distance range in order to avoid or limit biases such as dust reddening or possible systematic errors in our usno - b1.0 optical magnitudes .",
    "the third constraint excludes proper motion doubles with small separations , for which v and j magnitudes are often affected by large errors , particularly for the faint companions .",
    "the hipparcos and tycho catalog provides accurate space - based parallaxes for 1530 lspm stars .",
    "the hipparcos parallaxes generally have errors under 5 mas .",
    "unfortunately , these are limited to relatively bright ( @xmath37 ) objects , which are only effective in mapping the brighter half of the main sequence ( from spectral types ob to spectral type k ) . for the low - luminosity red dwarfs ( spectral type m )",
    ", one has to rely on ground - based parallaxes .",
    "the ypc catalog compiles most ground - based parallaxes published in the literature before 1995 .",
    "these , however , are not as homogeneous or accurate as the hipparcos parallaxes , and sometimes have errors as large as 40 - 50 mas . after applying the criteria above , we find reasonably accurate ypc parallaxes for a total of 695 additional lspm stars .",
    "hipparcos parallaxes can also be used for a limited number of fainter stars that happen to be common proper motion companions of hipparcos objects ( and are thus physically related and at the same distance ) .",
    "buy cross - correlating lspm positions with the hipparcos and tycho catalog , we find 60 lspm stars to be common proper motion companions of @xmath34 hipparcos stars , with angular separations @xmath38 between the components .",
    "the secondaries range in absolute magnitude from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .    despite these additions ,",
    "the combined sample of hipparcos and ypc stars remains deficient in objects at the bottom of the main sequence ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "accurate parallaxes of very low - mass m and l dwarfs have however been published in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "these papers provide parallaxes for 13 faint lspm stars , of which 11 have @xmath41 .",
    "finally , a search of the nstars database provides reliable parallaxes ( compiled from a variety of sources ) for 52 additional lspm stars , including 16 with @xmath41 .",
    "the final tally is 1,951 objects to be used as color - magnitude calibrators .",
    "absolute magnitudes @xmath42 for stars in the calibration subsample are calculated from their apparent @xmath43 magnitudes and observed trigonometric parallaxes @xmath33 .",
    "these are plotted against their @xmath44 colors in figure 1 .",
    "the main sequence is clearly visible , as is the white dwarf sequence on the lower left of the diagram .",
    "a few stars are found in between , and are most probably subdwarfs .",
    "the top of the main sequence ( @xmath45 ) is more densely populated than the bottom ( @xmath46 ) , which reflects the systematic availability of accurate @xmath33 for bright stars ( from the hipparcos catalog ) . at this time ,",
    "only limited samples of fainter stars have accurate ( ground - based ) parallaxes .    for the main sequence ( ms ) stars",
    ", we find a monotonic relationship between the @xmath44 color index and the absolute magnitude @xmath42 .",
    "the relationship has several inflection points .",
    "we subdivide it into 5 segments . for each",
    ", we calculate the relationship from a linear regression of the data points ( least squares fitting ) .",
    "we map the main sequence as follows : @xmath47\\ ] ] @xmath48\\ ] ] @xmath49\\ ] ] @xmath50\\ ] ] @xmath51\\ ] ] for any ms star , we can then calculate a photometric distance modulus @xmath52 with : @xmath53 where @xmath54 follows the relationships defined above .",
    "photometric parallaxes @xmath55 can then be estimated with : @xmath56      cccc 1.0 - 2.0 & -0.001 & 0.344 & 647 + 2.0 - 3.0 & -0.042 & 0.331 & 372 + 3.0 - 4.0 & 0.034 & 0.573 & 259 + 4.0 - 5.0 & -0.027 & 0.690 & 196 + 5.0 - 6.0 & -0.059 & 0.557 & 69 + 6.0 - 9.0 & -0.038 & 0.631 & 32    we estimate the accuracy of our photometric distance moduli by calculating @xmath52 for all our calibration stars , and comparing with the trigonometric distance moduli @xmath57 , where @xmath58 for each star , we calculate the difference between the trigonometric and photometric distance moduli @xmath59 . these are plotted in figure 2 as a function of @xmath44 for our calibration stars .",
    "we find a dispersion that increases from @xmath60 mag at @xmath61 to @xmath62 mag at @xmath63 , and down to @xmath64 mag at @xmath65 .",
    "the values for the scatter in the color - magnitude relationship are listed in table 1 , for given ranges in @xmath44 .",
    "these provide standard errors for the @xmath52 distance moduli estimates .",
    "the smaller ( larger ) errors on @xmath55 for the bluer ( redder ) stars is largely consistent with the expected accuracy of the @xmath43-band magnitudes in the lspm .",
    "the bluer calibration stars happen to be among the brighter stars in the lspm catalog ( @xmath37 ) for which the @xmath43 magnitudes are quoted from the tycho-2 catalog @xcite , and are accurate to @xmath36mag .",
    "most of the redder calibration stars , on the other hand , are drawn from the group of fainter lspm stars , which have their @xmath43 magnitudes estimated from photographic plate measurements , mostly based on magnitudes from the usno - b1.0 catalog of @xcite which are only accurate to @xmath27mag .",
    "one must note that at a given ( @xmath44 ) , the error in the distance modulus is generally not equivalent to the error in the @xmath43 magnitude .",
    "rather , it depends on the slope @xmath66 of the color - magnitude relationship @xmath67 . from equation 3",
    ", we see that a @xmath68 error in @xmath43 propagates as @xmath69 .",
    "hence for @xmath70 , a steeper slope means a larger error on the photometric distance modulus for a given @xmath68 . hence between @xmath71 , the @xmath72 mag error on the photographic magnitudes is expected to yield an @xmath73 mag error on the distance modulus , which is consistent with our results .    in any case , the dispersion in @xmath74 can not be attributed only to errors in the @xmath43-band magnitude measurements .",
    "there is an _ intrinsic _ dispersion in the color - magnitude relationship caused by a variety of factors such as multiplicity , variability , and metallicity .",
    "this has been known historically as the `` cosmic scatter '' .",
    "this scatter is clear from the @xmath75 mag dispersion observed for @xmath76 stars , whose @xmath43 magnitudes are those determined from hipparcos measurements , and are generally accurate to better than @xmath77 mag .",
    "intrinsic factors are also probably responsible for the existence of the several outliers ( @xmath78 from the mean )",
    ". these can be unresolved doubles , variables , or even metal - poor subdwarfs that are naturally expected to fall below the metal rich main sequence of the local galactic disk stars .",
    "the direct calibration of absolute magnitudes using parallax measurements is generally susceptible to a type of systematic errors , known as the lutz - kelker bias .",
    "a nice review of the topic can be found in @xcite .",
    "this bias generally results in absolute magnitudes being overestimated , and is dependent of the ratio of the parallax measurement errors over the measured parallaxes @xmath79 . given that our calibrators were selected to have @xmath80 , and given the stars",
    "were selected based on proper motion , we need to determine whether the lutz - kelker is significant , and whether corrections should be applied .",
    "generally , the lutz - kelker bias occurs in a subsample of objects with measured parallaxes @xmath81 and affected by measurement errors @xmath82 , when the distribution of true parallaxes @xmath83 in the underlying population decreases monotonically with @xmath83 ( as when the number of calibrators increases with distance ) .",
    "the measurement errors are symmetric about @xmath81 , but the probability distribution @xmath84 is not because of the asymmetry in the distribution of @xmath83 values around @xmath81 .",
    "simply put , because there are more distant stars than nearer ones , a star with measured parallax @xmath81 is more likely to be a distant star whose parallax is overestimated ( @xmath85 ) than a nearby one whose parallax is underestimated ( @xmath86 ) . on average",
    ", the mean parallax of a group of stars will thus be overestimated , which means the derived absolute magnitude will be overestimated too .",
    "the classical case investigated by @xcite is the one where the calibrators are uniformly distributed in space , for which the distribution in true parallax follows @xmath87 .",
    "an analytical derivation indicates a bias in the absolute magnitude calibration of + 0.11 mag for @xmath88 , down to + 0.02 mag for @xmath89 , and + 0.01 mag for @xmath90 .",
    "all our calibrators have @xmath91 , following our selection criteria .",
    "the hipparcos stars , which populate the upper half of the main sequence ( @xmath45 ) , tend to have significantly more accurate parallax measurements , with @xmath92 .",
    "this value corresponds to a very small classical lutz - kelker bias of only + 0.014 mag . for the calibrators that define the lower half of the main sequence ( @xmath46 ) , our sample has @xmath93 , which corresponds to a bias of + 0.019 mag .",
    "however , the above values most probably _ overestimate _ the actual lutz - kelker bias in our data .",
    "the reason is that our sample of calibrators is not drawn from the general supersample of stars in the solar neighborhood ( whose density is uniform ) but rather from a restricted supersample that includes only stars with proper motions above a certain value .",
    "this proper motion limit is @xmath94 for the hipparcos objects ( the lower limit of the lspm - north catalog ) . for the fainter calibration ,",
    "it is much larger because faint parallax targets have historically been selected among subsamples of stars with very large proper motions ( e.g. the lhs catalog , with a proper motion limit @xmath95 ) .",
    "the effect of drawing the calibrators from a proper - motion selected supersample tends to reduce the lutz - kelker bias , because the supersample will be increasingly incomplete at larger distances ( see  4 below ) , and the distribution function @xmath96 will be shallower than in the classical case .",
    "estimates of the lutz - kelker bias for shallower distribution has been investigated by e.g. @xcite , who showed that for power law distributions @xmath97 with @xmath98 , the magnitude of the lutz - kelker correction is reduced compared with the classical case ( @xmath99 ) .    given the uncertainty in the underlying bias associated with the supersample ( i.e. uncertainty in the form of @xmath96 ) , the application of any specific lutz - kelker correction to our calibration can not be justified . in any case , the lutz - kelker bias is most likely to be very small ( @xmath100 mag ) .",
    "our photometric distances may thus systematically underestimate the true distances of the candidate nearby stars , but only at the @xmath101 level . for any given star ,",
    "this bias is negligible compared with e.g. the intrinsic `` cosmic scatter '' of @xmath102 mag , or to the @xmath103 mag photometric errors .",
    "our goal is to identify the largest possible number of dwarf stars within the traditional confines of the solar neighborhood ( @xmath5 pc ) .",
    "since our photometric distances are accurate only to @xmath104 , an extension to 33pc ensures that the large majority of 25pc stars will fall into the sample .",
    "a limiting distance of 33pc is thus adopted .",
    "the lspm - north catalog does allow one to identify objects at much larger distances , but the objective of this paper is to provide a list of high priority objects of a size that can be managed by ground - based parallax programs .",
    "the lspm - north contains thousands of new hpm stars , but lists all previously known hpm stars as well , including those from the nltt and lhs catalogs .",
    "it is thus not surprising that a large number of lspm entries are stars that have have long been suspected ( or confirmed ) to be nearby . since the lspm is virtually complete for all stars with @xmath105 yr@xmath1 down to a magnitude @xmath25 , the vast majority of known nearby stars from the north celestial hemisphere",
    "are expected to have counterparts in the lspm - north .",
    "the only exceptions are known nearby stars with very small proper motions ( @xmath106 yr@xmath1 ) or objects with very faint optical magnitudes ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "the latter group includes most known nearby l and t dwarfs @xcite ; these are generally too faint in the optical bands to be detected on the poss - i / poss - ii red plates , on which the lspm - north is based . in any case , most of them are not stars but brown dwarfs .",
    "we searched the literature for parallax measurements of lspm sources which would place the star within 33 pc of the sun .",
    "our search turned up parallax measurements @xmath108 for 1676 lspm stars .",
    "this excludes stars whose positions in the color - magnitude diagram suggest they are either white dwarfs or subdwarfs .",

    "the excellent agreement observed between @xmath52 and both @xmath57 and @xmath119 argues against any systematic error in @xmath52 .",
    "this means that the @xmath122 underestimate distances by @xmath123% on average .",
    "stars with @xmath122 are overwhelmingly calibrated with the spectral - indices / absolute - magnitude relationships defined by @xcite .",
    "the 0.15 mag systematic error possibly results from the limited number of stars used to calibrate the relationships .",
    "note that the dispersion of 0.47 mag is only marginally larger than the dispersion on @xmath120 , which suggests that @xmath122 is , in principle , just about as accurate as @xmath119 , provided the zero point is accurately calibrated .",
    "using the color - magnitude calibration in  2 , it is straightforward to identify new candidate nearby red dwarfs from the lspm - north catalog .",
    "photometric distance moduli are simply estimated from @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( equations 1,2 ) .",
    "the only caution is that since the relationship is valid only for metal - rich ( disk ) ms stars , one must avoid applying it to other types of objects . while the bulk of the stars in the lspm - north catalog are disk ms stars , the catalog also includes significant numbers of metal - poor halo subdwarfs and white dwarfs , along with smaller numbers of giants and subgiants .",
    "relative to the dwarf ms stars , giant stars are _ overluminous _ for a given @xmath44 color .",
    "applying the dwarf color - magnitude relationship thus yields underestimated distances .",
    "giant stars are quite rare in the solar neighborhood , but they can significantly contaminate samples of color - selected nearby star candidates since they tend to be detected over a much larger volume . fortunately , proper motion selection filters out the majority of more distant objects : the 0.15@xmath10 yr@xmath1 limit of the lspm - north catalog eliminates most disk stars beyond @xmath124pc ( assuming disk stars to have transverse velocities @xmath12570km / s ) , and most halo stars beyond @xmath126pc ( assuming @xmath125400km / s ) .",
    "giant stars that made it into the lspm - north catalog are bright enough to be hipparcos objects , and since there already is good parallaxes for them , no confusion is possible",
    ". the more problematic objects might be the subgiants , which are only moderately overluminous relative to the ms stars .",
    "the lspm - north potentially contains subgiant stars that are too faint ( @xmath127 ) to be hipparcos objects .",
    "however , these are expected to be relatively blue ( @xmath128 ) . according to our calibration ( eq.1 ) ,",
    "main sequence stars with @xmath128 have absolute magnitudes @xmath129 , which means they have apparent magnitude @xmath130 at 33pc . since the current goal is to identify ms stars within 33pc of the sun , the search can be restricted to lspm stars with @xmath131 .",
    "any bluer object within 33pc should have already been found and measured by hipparcos .",
    "this constraint also effectively eliminates subgiants as a source of contaminants .",
    "white dwarf stars , on the other hand , are _ underluminous _ for any given @xmath44 color .",
    "as can be seen from fig.1 , the white dwarf sequence falls @xmath1325 magnitudes below the main sequence in the standard color - magnitude diagram .",
    "assuming the color - magnitude relationship for ms stars ( eq.1 ) were applied to a white dwarf , the object would have its distance overestimated by a factor of 10 . restricting the search to stars within 33pc of the sun",
    "virtually eliminates the possibility of a contamination of the sample with white dwarfs , because to make it into the 33pc sample of candidate stars , the white dwarf would actually have to be within 3.3pc of the sun . at this time ,",
    "there is no known isolated white dwarf star within 3.3pc of the sun .",
    "the probability of white dwarfs `` contaminating '' the 33 pc sample is very small .",
    "subdwarf stars are also _ underluminous _ in @xmath42 for a given @xmath44 color , although not as much as are the white dwarfs .",
    "most nearby subdwarfs are local member of the galactic halo population .",
    "one way to separate disc dwarfs from halo subdwarfs is to use an optical - to - infrared reduced proper motion diagram @xcite . because the reduced proper motion is proportional to both the absolute magnitude of a star and its transverse velocity , halo subdwarfs , with their larger systemic velocities , fall well below the disc dwarf sequence .",
    "but while this helps in separating halo dwarfs from disc subdwarfs , the method only works , statistically , on large groups of objects , and is unreliable for individual stars . in any case ,",
    "halo subdwarfs are rare in the solar neighborhood ( about 1 star in 200 ) ; if they are found in significant numbers in proper motion catalogs it is because of their larger mean velocity relative to the sun . again , restricting the search to ms stars within 33 pc of the sun minimizes contamination of the nearby stars sample .",
    "the @xmath0 yr@xmath1 limit includes all stars at 33 pc with transverse velocities @xmath133 km s@xmath1 , which still overwhelmingly consists of disk stars . increasing the distance would , however , increase the ratio of subdwarfs to dwarfs in the census .",
    "for example , lspm stars at 100 pc have @xmath134 km s@xmath1 and exclude most of the disk dwarfs , leaving a much larger fraction of halo subdwarfs .    our nearby ms stars selection box , in the @xmath135 diagram , is depicted in figure 5 , overlaid on the distribution of lspm - north stars .",
    "the selection box marks the locus of ms stars within 3 pc and 33 pc from the sun .",
    "note how the selection box avoids regions on the graph that are mainly populated with giants , white dwarfs , and subdwarfs , as explained above .",
    "any star that falls in the box , and that is not a known nearby star ( i.e. it is not listed in tables 2 - 3 ) is flagged as a new nearby star candidate .",

    "it is interesting to note that the census of known nearby stars with _ small _ proper motions is disproportionately biased toward hipparcos ( @xmath37 ) objects , whereas the census of nearby stars with _ large _ proper motions is dominated by non - hipparcos ( @xmath165 ) stars .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that ground - based parallax programs ( which the ypc is a compilation of ) have been largely dependent on lists of candidates selected on the basis of large proper motions .",
    "the proper motion limit results in an increasing incompleteness in the nearby star census as a function of distance .",
    "it is possible to estimate how many low - velocity stars are missing at larger distances by mapping the distribution of low - velocity stars that actually get detected at smaller distances .",

    "no correction is necessary for velocity bins @xmath167 km s@xmath1 , since the @xmath0 yr@xmath1 limit of the lspm - north is sensitive to star with such velocities out to at least 33 pc . for bins with @xmath168 km s@xmath1 , the bins are normalized by a factor @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is the maximum distance a star with transverse velocity @xmath166 can be detected by a proper motion survey with @xmath164 yr@xmath1 limit .",
    "the `` predicted '' velocity distribution at small @xmath166 ( see figure 9 ) shows fluctuations because of small number statistics , but it is clear that at least a thousand stars must be missing from the census because of their small proper motion .",
    "a simple estimate suggests that there should be @xmath171 stars within 33 pc of the sun .",
    "the current census includes only 4434 stars , the 4,131 ones listed in the lspm - north , plus the 302 known nearby low proper motion objects ( see above ) .",
    "the current , overall completeness of the 33pc census is thus only @xmath172 .",

    "the current completeness of the 25pc census , the traditional extent of the `` solar neighborhood '' , is thus @xmath175 .",
    "the 500 or so missing stars are expected to have proper motions below the limit of the lspm - north .",

    "it is found , however , that the sample of main sequence dwarfs selected based on the color - magnitude relationship should not be significantly contaminated by mis - identified white dwarfs and subdwarfs , as long as the search is limited to stars within 33 pc of the sun .",

    "results will be presented in upcoming papers in this series . while these will also yield spectroscopic distance moduli ,",
