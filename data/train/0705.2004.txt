    "the ogle - iii deep - field survey ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) has identified 3 transiting planetary systems with very short orbital periods :  ( @xmath2hr ; @xcite ) ,  ( @xmath3hr ; @xcite ) , and  ( @xmath4hr ; @xcite ) . at the time of discovery ,",
    "such 1-d period planets were conspicuously absent from radial velocity ( rv ) surveys .",
    "these surveys had not discovered a planet with an orbital period of substantially less than 3d , despite the sensitivity of such surveys to planets with short orbital periods .",
    "several authors reconciled this apparent discrepancy by determining the respective observational biases and selection effects @xcite .",
    "since then , hot jupiters with periods just over 2d have been detected by both rv surveys (;",
    "@xcite ) and wide - field transit surveys (;",
    "@xcite ) , indicating a consistent picture for the underlying distribution of orbital periods of hot jupiters .    with the discovery of these nearby planets",
    ", we continue to observe @xcite the decreasing linear relation between @xmath5 and the planetary mass ( @xmath6 ) for transiting planets first noticed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it appears from this small number of planets that shorter period exoplanets are on average more massive .",
    "this may suggest different evolution of these planetary systems than the canonical migration ( ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ) of hot jupiters from beyond the ice line .",
    "we present here the discovery of , a massive planet which has one of the shortest periods of the transiting planets , and which was independently identified by two transit surveys .",
    "transits of the parent star  were detected by two 10-cm telescopes , part of the trans - atlantic exoplanet survey ( tres ) network . sleuth ( palomar observatory , california ) observed 7 full transits and 3 partial transits , of which 3 full and 2 partial transits were observed by the planet search survey telescope ( lowell observatory , arizona ; @xcite ) .",
    "we obtained these observations between ut 2006 may 6 and 2006 august 2 , during which time we monitored a field of view ( fov ) centered on .",
    "we then processed the data from each telescope separately , as we have described previously @xcite .",
    "we then search our binned light curves using the box - fitting transit search algorithm of @xcite for periodic event consistent with the passage of a jupiter - sized planet across a solar - like star .",
    "we flagged  as a candidate , noting that the transit duration of 1.3hr implied a high impact parameter @xmath7 .",
    "transits of  were independently observed by the hungarian automated telescope network ( hatnet ; @xcite ) .",
    "we observed the hat field `` g196 '' between ut 2005 june 8 to december 5 , using the hat-7 telescope at the fred  l.  whipple observatory ( flwo ) and hat-9 at the submillimeter array atop mauna kea .",
    "we applied standard calibration and aperture photometry procedures to the frames as described earlier in @xcite .",
    "we also applied the trend filtering algorithm @xcite , and identified  as a transit candidate using the algorithm of @xcite .",
    "we observed  using the cfa digital speedometers @xcite on 13 occasions from 2006 september 9 to 2007 april 6 .",
    "these spectra are centered at 5187  and cover 45  with a resolving power of .",
    "we derived rvs at each epoch by cross - correlation against synthetic spectra created by j.  morse using kurucz model stellar atmospheres ( j.  morse & r.  l.  kurucz  2004 , private communication ) .",
    "there is no significant variation in these measurements , which have a mean of and a scatter of .",
    "this limits the mass of the companion to be less than about @xmath8 .",
    "we estimated the stellar parameters from a cross - correlation analysis similar to that above , assuming a solar metallicity .",
    "the effective temperature ( @xmath9 ) , surface gravity ( @xmath10 ) , and projected rotational velocity ( @xmath11 ) we derive are listed in table  [ tab : tres3 ] . based on these values",
    ", we estimate the stellar mass to be @xmath12 .",
    "further spectroscopic analysis of the parent star ( similar to that performed for  and ; @xcite ) is in progress and will be presented elsewhere .    the 2mass @xmath13 color ( 0.407mag ) and ucac2 proper motion ( ) of  are as expected for a nearby g - dwarf .",
    "we obtained absolute @xmath14 photometry for  on the night of ut 2007 april 14 with the 105-cm hall telescope at lowell observatory .",
    "the photometry was calibrated using seven standard fields from @xcite .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : tres3 ] .",
    "we observed a full transit in the @xmath1-band on ut 2007 march 26 using keplercam ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at the telescope .",
    "we obtained 150 90-s exposures of a @xmath15 fov containing .",
    "we observed another transit in bessell @xmath0 on ut 2007 april 8 with the las cumbres observatory global telescope 2-m faulkes telescope north on haleakala , maui , hawaii .",
    "the ccd camera imaged a @xmath16 square field with an effective pixel size of @xmath17 ( the images were binned @xmath18 ) .",
    "we obtained 126 images with an exposure time of 60s and a cadence of 70s .",
    "we defocused the telescope slightly ( to an image diameter of about @xmath19 ) to avoid saturation of the brightest comparison star .",
    "we analyzed these data sets separately . using standard iraf procedures",
    ", we corrected the images for bias , dark current , and flat - field response .",
    "we determined fluxes of the target star and numerous comparison stars using synthetic aperture photometry .",
    "to correct the target star fluxes for time - varying atmospheric extinction , we divided them by a weighted average of the fluxes of all the comparison stars .",
    "we collected high - precision rv measurements on ut 2007 march 2729 using hires @xcite and its i@xmath20 absorption cell on the keck  i telescope .",
    "we obtained a total of 7 star+iodine exposures and 1 template spectrum .",
    "all spectra were gathered with a nominal resolving power , using the hires setup with the @xmath21 slit .",
    "we used an integration time of 15min , which yielded a typical signal - to - noise ratio of .",
    "we reduced the raw spectra using the makee software written by t.  barlow .",
    "we have described the software used to derive relative radial velocities with an iodine cell in earlier works ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we estimate our internal errors from the scatter about the mean for each spectral order divided by the square root of the number of orders containing i@xmath20 lines , and find them to be around @xmath22 .",
    "the radial - velocity measurements are listed in table  [ tab : rvtres3 ] .",
    "we constrained the orbital fit to these data to have zero eccentricity ( @xmath23 ) , as expected from theoretical arguments for such a short period planet , and we also held @xmath5 and the transit epoch @xmath24 fixed at their values determined from the photometric data .",
    "the rms residual from this fit ( 15.4 ) is larger than the typical internal errors ( 10 ) .",
    "preliminary analysis of the template spectrum suggests that the star shows evidence of activity . for the inferred spectral type ,",
    "the presence of radial - velocity `` jitter '' of is not unexpected @xcite , and would explain the excess scatter we find .",
    "figure  [ fig : rvtres3 ] displays the rv data overplotted with the best - fit model , along with the residuals from the fit .",
    "the parameters of the orbital solution are listed in table  [ tab : tres3b ] .",
    "we find a minimum planetary mass of , where @xmath25 represents the orbital inclination . as a consistency check we repeated the fit with",
    "@xmath5 fixed and @xmath26 as before , but solving for @xmath24 .",
    "the result is , which is consistent with , but less precise than , the value determined from the photometry ( table  [ tab : tres3b ] ) .",
    "we investigated the possibility that the velocity variations are due not to a planetary companion , but instead to distortions in the line profiles caused by an unresolved eclipsing binary @xcite .",
    "we cross - correlated each spectrum against a synthetic template matching the properties of the star , and averaged the correlation functions over all orders blueward of the region affected by the iodine lines . from this representation of the average spectral line profile we computed the mean bisectors , and as a measure of the line asymmetry we calculated the `` bisector spans '' as the velocity difference between points selected near the top and bottom of the mean bisectors @xcite .",
    "if the velocity variations were the result of a stellar blend , we would expect the bisector spans to vary in phase with the photometric period with an amplitude similar to that seen in the rvs @xcite .",
    "instead , we do not detect any variation exceeding the measurement uncertainties ( see figure  [ fig : rvtres3 ] ) .",
    "we conclude that the rv variations are real , and the star is indeed orbited by a jovian planet .",
    "we analyze our photometric time series using the analytic transit curves of @xcite and the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) techniques described in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "we assume a circular orbit of constant @xmath5 .",
    "we first estimate @xmath24 by fitting a model light curve ( as described below ) to only the @xmath1 data .",
    "we then determine @xmath5 by phase - folding the @xmath1 data with the tres and hat discovery data ( which affords a baseline of 1.8years ) while varying the trial values for @xmath5 .",
    "we then fix the values for @xmath24 and @xmath5 ( stated in table  [ tab : tres3b ] ) in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the values of the planet radius @xmath27 and the stellar radius @xmath28 as constrained by the light curves are covariant with @xmath29 . in our mcmc analysis , we fix @xmath30 , and then estimate the systematic error in the radii using the scaling relations @xmath31 ( see footnote to table  [ tab : tres3 ] ) .",
    "we assume a quadratic limb - darkening law with coefficients fixed at the band - dependent values tabulated in @xcite for the spectroscopically - estimated @xmath9 and @xmath32 and assuming solar metallicity .",
    "the remaining free parameters in our model are @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath25 .",
    "we require two additional parameters , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , the respective residual color - dependent extinction to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves , assuming that the observed flux is proportional to @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the airmass .",
    "we find that the tres and hat discovery data are too noisy to meaningfully constrain the parameters , and so we restrict our analysis to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 data .",
    "we first find the values of @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath25 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 that minimize @xmath37 using the amoeba algorithm @xcite .",
    "this model is shown as the solid curves in figure  [ fig : treslc ] .",
    "we then created 2 mcmc chains with @xmath38 points each , one starting from the best - fit values and one starting a randomly - generated perturbation to these values .",
    "we subsequently rejected the first @xmath39 points to minimize the effect of the initial conditions , and found the results of the two chains to be indistinguishable .",
    "we then examined the histograms of the 5 input parameter values , as well as the histograms for several combinations of parameters relevant to anticipated follow - up studies .",
    "we assigned the optimal value to be the median , and the 1-@xmath40 error to be the symmetric range about the median that encompassed 68.3% of the values .",
    "we state our estimates of the parameters in table  [ tab : tres3b ] .",
    "the estimated values for @xmath33 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath34 ( @xmath42 ) are small and of opposite sign , which is consistent with a modest difference between the average color of the calibration field stars and the target .    despite the v - shaped transit ,",
    "our best - fit values indicate that  is not grazing , i.e.  the disk of the planet is entirely contained within the disk of the star at mid - transit , although grazing solutions are permitted by the data .",
    "importantly , our ability to obtain well - constrained estimates of @xmath43 and @xmath28 despite the large @xmath7 hinged on having observations of the transit in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . the large difference in central wavelength and",
    "hence stellar limb - darkening between these two bands permitted us to rule out a family of degenerate solutions that is allowed by observations in only a single color .",
    "we tested this notion by repeating the analysis above for only the @xmath1 data , and found that values of @xmath27 as large as @xmath44 could not be excluded .",
    "presents a useful testbed for theoretical models of gas giants .",
    "its radius places it in the growing family of planets with radii that exceed that predicted for models of irradiated gas giants .",
    "it is one of the most massive transiting planets , and has one of the shortest periods .",
    "we recall that the discovery of  at a distance of only 0.023au from its star stimulated investigations into the timescales for orbital decay and thermal evaporation .",
    "the comparable orbital separation of  implies that many of these estimates are directly applicable to the new planet , but with the important difference that the much brighter apparent magnitude affords the opportunity for more precise study .",
    "in particular , we note that direct searches for decay of the orbital period may inform our understanding of dissipation in stellar convective zones @xcite , particularly since both the  planet and its stellar convective zone are more massive than that of .",
    "furthermore , the mass and orbital separation of  are intriguingly close to the critical values estimated by @xcite below which evaporation would become a dominant process .",
    "the measurement of the angle between the planetary orbit and stellar spin axis of  may detect the substantial misalignment that might be expected for planets that were tidally captured rather than migrating inwards @xcite .",
    "assuming isotropic emission , the equilibrium temperature of  is @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the bond albedo .",
    "we intend to obtain _ spitzer _ observations of , as we have previously done for  and .",
    "finally , we note that  is extremely favorable for attempts to detect reflected starlight @xcite and thus determine the geometric albedo , @xmath47 of the planet .",
    "the flux of the planet near opposition relative to that of the star is @xmath48 , which is more than twice that of any of the other known nearby transiting planets .",
