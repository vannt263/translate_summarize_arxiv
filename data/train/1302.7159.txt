    "at functional scales , cortical networks are composed of a large number of cells subject to an intense noise .",
    "such networks process and encode information collectively , and in the variety of information transmitted , synchronous activity and periodic behaviors are ubiquitous  @xcite , both in physiological ( associated to memory and attention ) and pathological ( epilepsy ) states .",
    "oscillatory patterns observed can be extremely complex .",
    "theoretical descriptions of such complex oscillations have been satisfactorily performed in deterministic models of single neurons , and are generally attributed to the presence of several very different time scales in the dynamics .",
    "the analysis of these systems shed light on important and sensitive dynamical scenarios such as canard explosions ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the question we address in this work is whether such oscillatory patterns can arise in the context of large - scale neuronal aggregates , including a very large number of neurons , strongly interconnected and subject to noise . in other words",
    ", we will be interested in complex oscillatory patterns that can appear in large scale neuronal assemblies in the presence of noise . as was the case of deterministic small dimension model",
    ", we will specifically focus on the _ canard phenomenon _ and the related phenomenon of _ mixed mode oscillations _ ( mmos ) .",
    "canard phenomenon , known also as _ canard explosion _ is a transition from a small , hopf type oscillation to a relaxation oscillation , occurring upon variation of a parameter .",
    "this transition has been first found in the context of the van der pol equation  @xcite and soon after in numerous models of phenomena occurring in engineering and in chemical reactions  @xcite .",
    "a common feature of all these models is the presence of time scale separation ( slow and fast variables ) .",
    "a particular feature of canard explosion is that it takes place in a very small parameter interval . for the van der pol system , where the ratio of the timescales is given by a small parameter @xmath0",
    ", the width of this parameter interval can be estimated by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is a fixed positive constant .",
    "the transition occurs through a sequence of _ canard cycles _ whose striking feature is that they contain segments following closely a stable slow manifold and subsequently an unstable slow manifold .",
    "the work on canard explosion led to investigations of slow / fast systems in three dimensions , with two slow and one fast variables . in the context of these systems",
    "the concept of a _ canard solution _ or simply _ canard _ has been introduced , as a solution passing from a stable to an unstable slow manifold @xcite .",
    "canards arise near so called folded singularities of which the best known is folded node @xcite .",
    "unlike in systems with one slow variable canards occur robustly ( in @xmath3 parameter regions ) . related to canards",
    "are mixed mode oscillations ( mmos ) , which are trajectories that combine small oscillations and large oscillations of relaxation type , both recurring in an alternating manner .",
    "recently there has been a lot of interest in mmos that arise due to the presence of canards , starting with the work of milik , szmolyan , loeffelmann and groeller @xcite .",
    "the small oscillations arise during the passage of the trajectories near a folded node or a related folded singularity .",
    "the dynamics near the folded singularity is transient , yet recurrent : the trajectories return to the neighborhood of the folded singularity by way of a global return mechanism @xcite .    due to the sensitivity of this phenomena",
    ", one may expect that canard explosions disappear in the presence of noise .",
    "this is implied by the results of  @xcite , who study a system with small noise . using a pathwise approach ,",
    "they show that small noise perturbations dramatically disturb the behavior of the slow - fast system they consider , hiding small oscillations in the random fluctuation and having a positive probability to escape from the canard solution . in this picture",
    ", it seems relatively hopeless to obtain at the levels of noise typical of the cortical activity , and at the dimension of the system , collective canard phenomena and individual canards with a high degree of reproducibility and regularity .",
    "however , in large scale stochastic systems , averaging effects can take place , regularizing the probability distribution of the macroscopic activity , as well as that of individual cells .",
    "these macroscopic behaviors and the averaging effects arising at the level of large networks are mathematically characterized by limit systems , the _ mean - field limits_. in the present manuscript we show that canard explosion and complex oscillatory pattern appear in the presence of ( not necessarily small ) noise in these mean - field limits .",
    "moreover , we show that such phenomena may arise through noise induced bifurcations .",
    "usual computational neurosciences descriptions of large scale networks rely on heuristic models which were derived in the seminal works of wilson , cowan and amari  @xcite .",
    "these models implicitly make the assumption that noise cancels out through averaging effects in the asymptotic regime where the number of neurons goes to infinity .",
    "the analysis of these heuristic models successfully accounted for a number of cortical phenomena such as spatio - temporal pattern formation in spatially extended models  @xcite .",
    "indeed , in order to uncover , in large scale noisy system , the presence of fine effects such as complex oscillatory patterns or canard explosions , one needs to very precisely describe the limits of the network activity as the number of neurons increases .",
    "this is why we will apply a recent developed approach based on the theory of interacting particle systems to our networks .",
    "this approach was used in a very general context including nonlinear models of spiking neurons , spatial extension and propagation delays in  @xcite .",
    "the resulting macroscopic states are described through extremely complex equations , and in general do not provide sufficient information on the dynamics of the global variables . however , in a simple amari - hopfield type of models , it was shown in  @xcite that under the condition that initial conditions are gaussian that the equations can be exactly reduced to a set of deterministic differential equations governing the two first moments of the solutions , and these were used to analyze the dynamics of the macroscopic regimes  @xcite .",
    "this approach is precisely the one chosen in the present article .",
    "in contrast with the previous studies in this domain , we will consider here that the neurons interact through a nonlinear function of a mean - field term corresponding to the current generated at the level of each population .",
    "this model , known as the wilson - cowan model , is biologically more relevant . moreover , in the original article of wilson and cowan  @xcite , the system is introduced with a slow - fast structure that , to the best of our knowledge , was never analyzed in the perspective of canard explosions and mmos .",
    "this model has been widely studied in the context of computational neuroscience , and seems particularly suited for the analysis of the dynamics of large networks . from the computational neuroscience viewpoint",
    ", this analysis will shed light on the finite - dimensional wilson - cowan system , since incidentally the reduced mean - field equations will be a particular case of wilson - cowan system . from the mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "the mean - field equations arising in the case of nonlinear global coupling were never considered in literature and lead to a number of technical questions that will be treated in the present article .",
    "moreover , that model has the advantage that the solutions of the mean - field equations have their statistical expectation satisfying a system of ordinary differential equations , regardless of the initial condition chosen , allowing for an application of bifurcation theory to analyze the system .",
    "the relative simplicity of the model will allow us to go very deep into the mathematical analysis of large scale neuronal networks in the presence of noise and different timescales , and address the problem of the presence of complex oscillatory patterns and canards in such systems .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : mflimits ] is devoted to the introduction of the models and the derivation of the mean - field equations . this section deals with general neuron models with nonlinear synapses , multiple populations , timescales and noise .",
    "we apply this analysis to the wilson - cowan system and derive the related moment equations , a set of ordinary differential equations .",
    "the obtained equations are then analyzed in section  [ sec : bifurcations ] , and we show that the system present canard explosions that can lead , in different contexts , to mixed - mode oscillations as the noise parameter is varied .",
    "these phenomena are recovered in numerical simulations of the finite - size network equations as shown in section  [ sec : network ] where finite - size effects are also analyzed .",
    "this section introduces a general model of multi - population neuronal network and derives the related macroscopic mean - field equations arising as a limit when the network size goes to infinity .",

    "each population is composed of a large number of neurons denoted @xmath6 .",
    "the state of neuron @xmath7 in population @xmath8 is described by a variable @xmath9 typically describing the membrane potential of the cell and different ionic concentrations .",

    "neurons receive inputs corresponding to the sum of a deterministic current @xmath14 only depending on the population they belong to , and stochastic current driven by independent stochastic process @xmath15 with common law ( denoted with a slight abuse of notations @xmath16 ) , that will be considered to be ornstein - uhlenbeck processes , taking into account the synaptic filtering . in their most general form ,",
    "the class of models analyzed here satisfy the network equations : @xmath17 where @xmath18 represents the effect of an input current @xmath19 onto a cell of population @xmath8 with potential @xmath20 , @xmath21 the total current received through the network , and @xmath22 is the population function associating to a neuron @xmath23 the population @xmath12 it belongs to .",
    "this class of models is particularly interesting since it allows dealing with a number of situations arising in neurosciences .",
    "a prominent example of this class that will be useful in our developments is the wilson - cowan model , or activity - based firing rate model  @xcite .",
    "this model describes the mean firing - rate variable of a neuron ( a real variable ) of neuron @xmath7 in the population @xmath8 through the differential equation : @xmath24 in this model , the variable @xmath25 represents the activity of the cell , and the right hand side is the incoming firing - rate to the cell @xmath7 , filtered through the voltage to rate function @xmath26 characterizing the integration properties of the synapse when subject to a input current ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "another model of this class allows taking into account finer phenomena arising in the cell s activity motivating the description of additional variables , such as slow adaptation currents  @xcite or slow modulation currents  @xcite .",
    "these models correspond to minimal descriptions of systems with slow adaptation proposed by izhikevich in  @xcite : in two - dimensional systems , a variety of behavior can be accounted for using a single slow adaptation .",
    "we slightly generalize this model and define a multi - population networks with mean - field slow modulation current .",
    "these systems are described by the following equations , for neuron @xmath7 in population @xmath8 : @xmath27    beyond these simple models that will be exactly reducible to odes , the class of models includes classical models in neurosciences such as the fitzhugh - nagumo model ( @xmath28 , @xmath10 has a cubic and an affine component , and @xmath29 is either a linear function when considering electrical synapses or a sigmoid transform when considering chemical synapses ) or the hodgkin - huxley system .",
    "these models differ from usual systems analyzed in the mean - field limit in that there is a nonlinear summation of the interactions , here through our voltage - to - rate function .",
    "limits of such interacting stochastic processes were the number of neurons tends to infinity were never addressed for such interactions considering the nonlinear transform @xmath30 .",

    "we start by analyzing the finite - size effects in our two population network . for our choice of parameters",

    "[ fig : bifdiagcolors2d ] and shows that , as a function of noise levels , the system either presents a unique stable stationary distribution ( blue region ) , an unstable fixed point and a stable periodic orbit corresponding to relaxation oscillations for large noise ( pink region ) , and an intermediate noise region ( yellow ) where we have co - existence of a stable stationary distribution and a stable periodic orbit , separated by an unstable periodic orbit .",
    "this parameter region is referred to as the bistability regime .    in the case where a unique stable solutions exists for",
    "the limit averaged equation ( pink or blue regions ) , network trajectories will display random fluctuations well approximating the attractor .",
    "this is what is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : uniqueattractor2d ] , both in the case of stationary and periodic solutions .",
    "the canard explosion , displayed in section  [ sec : bifurcations ] , corresponds to the sharp transition from fixed point to relaxation oscillations , and due to the fact that the canard explosion occurs through subcritical hopf bifurcation prevents from observing the full canard explosion and canard cycles , that correspond to unstable trajectories of the limit ode and of the network equations .    in the bistability regime , trajectories are more complex and finite - size effects will result in random switches between the two attractors .",
    "typical shape of the phase plane , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : phaseplane2d ] , show the coexistence of relaxation oscillations and stable fixed points .",
    "the separatrix between the two attractors is the unstable limit cycle arising from the hopf bifurcation , winding around the fixed point .",
    "incidentally , we observe that the unstable periodic orbit and the relaxation oscillations cycles are extremely close ( they are arbitrarily close when the intensity of the noise approaches the value corresponding to the fold of limit cycles ) .",
    "therefore , in this parameter region , random switches from relaxation oscillations to random fluctuations around the stable fixed point will occur , phenomenon that we term random attractor switching .",
    "similarly to what was shown in  @xcite , we may interpret the switching trajectories as random mmos .",
    "however , in contrast to their setting , the noise perturbation involved in our case are not driven by white noise with constant standard deviation . as we analyze in a forthcoming study",
    ", the finite - size perturbations correspond to gaussian perturbations with standard deviation function of the solution of the mean - field equations .",
    "the nature of this process implies that the random switches do not occur completely randomly , but depend on the size of the fluctuations , which is governed by a function of the mean - field equation .",
    "a consequence will be , as presented in the example plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : trajswitches ] , that the system has a bias to switch in phase with the virtual periodic attractor .",
    "this surprising phenomenon will be analyzed in greater detail in a forthcoming study .",
    "let us eventually discuss the occurrence of switches as a function of the size of the network and of the parameters .",
    "we observe that the attraction bassin of the stationary solution becomes increasingly large as noise approaches the value corresponding to the fold of limit cycles , and increasingly small when approaching the hopf bifurcation .",
    "close from the value of the fold of limit cycles , random switches from the periodic to the stationary solutions will become very probable and switches from the stationary to the periodic solutions are less probable , implying that the averaged time spent in the neighborhood of the stationary solution will become larger as we approach the fold of limit cycle",
    ". a symmetrical phenomenon will arise close from the hopf bifurcation . in order to illustrate this phenomenon , we display in fig .  [ fig : averagetime ] the average time spent in a neighborhood of the stationary solution ( actually inside the deterministic attraction bassin of the stable fixed point depicted in blue in fig .  [",
    "fig : phaseplane2d ] ) as a function of the noise level , averaged across 20 trajectories .",
    "these switching probabilities also depend on the size of the network . indeed",
    ", as the number of neurons tends to infinity , that probability tends to zero , and the trajectory will be deterministically locked to that predicted by the mean - field theory and the initial condition , and the smaller the network size , the more likely the switches will occur .    .",
    "]    we therefore conclude from the present analysis that finite - size effects barely affect the solution , and that the mean - field model accurately describes the behavior of the network in most of the parameter space , except during the canard explosion , in an exponentially small region of parameters , and in that region , random switches between multiple attractors may occur , as a function of the network size and the geometry of the limit dynamical system .",
    "we now investigate the behavior of finite - sized networks in the 2 populations wilson - cowan system with slow adaptation currents analyzed in the mean - field limit in section  [ wc3d ] .",
    "the analysis the resulting mean - field system showed that the system presented a fsn ii bifurcation related to the presence of mixed - mode oscillations , the shape of which sensitively depended of the noise levels @xmath127 and @xmath133 , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : drs ] .",
    "the reduction obtained of these equations allowed analyze the behavior for extremely high values of the noise which are not accessible through numerical simulations of the noisy network , chiefly due to precision constraints as we mentioned .",
    "we now confront the different behaviors observed in section  [ wc3d ] to simulations of the noisy network equations with the same parameters .",
    "we expect in this case that the trajectories obtained in the mmo regime to be less resilient to perturbations than the stationary and periodic orbits analyzed in the two - populations network , due to the sensitivity of the attractor in particular in the small oscillations phase .",
    "in contrast with the analysis of the two - populations wilson - cowan model , we will therefore observe more drastic finite - size effects even in regimes where there exists a unique attractor , since it is the very structure of the attractor that presents sensitivity to perturbations .",
    "these will lead to escape the attractor during the small oscillations phase , or _ early jumps_.",
    "this is what we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmosnet ] where we reproduce the bifurcation scenario displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : drs ] for fixed noise @xmath157 and different values of the parameter @xmath133 ( the only scenario we did not display was ( b ) , which requires very simulations on very long time intervals due to the very large period of the mixed - mode oscillation ) . in all cases , we recover the qualitative nature of the solutions predicted in the infinite - size limit , and early jumps , corresponding to systematic random escape of the attractor , occur due to finite - size effects . moreover , we observe that the small oscillations tend to be hidden by the noise related to the finite - size effects .",
    "these two finite - size effects of course disappear when considering larger networks and one recovers with precision the attractor predicted by the theory , as we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mmoprecise ] for a network of @xmath168 neurons . but",
    "as soon as the number of neurons is smaller , the network will systematically fail to follow precisely the predicted mmo and will generally escape the attractor prior than the infinite - sized system .",
    "in a number of applied domains such as physics , chemistry and neurosciences , the emergence of complex oscillations such as mixed - mode oscillations have been theoretically related to canard explosions and multiple timescales dynamics of deterministic dynamical systems ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "but the mechanisms underlying the existence of such orbits generally involve a number of interacting agents , for instance neurons , that are characterized by a stochastic activity .",
    "it was hence important in that context to show that such orbits persist in these contexts , and to identify the mechanisms accounting for the emergence of such collective behaviors . at the level of one single cell with stochastic perturbations",
    ", studies showed that systems presenting canard explosions displayed random mmos , with the effect of randomly modifying the period of the oscillations and changing the qualitative nature of the solution even in small noise  @xcite . in this paper , the authors analyze stochastic perturbations of fitzhugh - nagumo model in the relaxation oscillations regime concluded indeed noise resulted in sensible modifications of the trajectories with random interspike intervals and trajectories similar to mmos with a random number of small oscillations that asymptotically distribute as a geometric random variable .",
    "as of mixed - mode oscillations , berglund and collaborators  @xcite analyzed the effect of gaussian noise on a 3 dimensional system with different timescales known to feature mixed - mode oscillations and show that noise changes the global dynamics and mixed mode patterns , and that there exists a maximal amount of noise above which small oscillations are hidden by noise .",
    "these studies pointed towards the fact that other phenomena , more resilient to noise , took place in large noisy systems giving rise to such complex oscillations in the presence of multiple timescales .    here",
    ", we revisited these questions and proposed that self - averaging of the trajectories in large networks could provide a simple generic explanation to the emergence of complex oscillations in large - scale noisy networks .",
    "we based our analysis on a classical model of neuronal network , the wilson - cowan system , which describes heuristically the dynamics of firing - rates of neurons .",
    "this system presented two advantages in our view .",
    "first an unsolved mathematical problem was to rigorously derive asymptotic limits of these networks with nonlinear mean - field interactions as the number of neurons tends to infinity .",
    "the nature of is indeed very different to usual network equations analyzed in the domain of mean - field limits and propagation of chaos as developed in gas dynamics and extended to neurosciences  @xcite , since the interacting term is a nonlinear function of a mean - field term , and moreover that the neurons are not governed by a stochastic differential equation but rather by a differential equation with stochastic coefficients @xmath15 .",
    "this lead us to extend the theory of mean - field limits towards this new kind of equations , which we developed in a relatively general fashion in section  [ sec : mflimits ] .",
    "applied to wilson - cowan equations , this result allowed us to exactly reduce the network equations to a multiple timescales ode acting on the mean of the solution .",
    "interestingly , these equations reduce to a modified wilson - cowan system where the noise level is embedded in the nonlinearities .",
    "the analysis of the mean equation developed in section  [ sec : bifurcations ] had at least two interests .",
    "first , the fact that the asymptotic equation on the mean of the solution is itself solution of a wilson - cowan type of equation allowed to go deeper in the understanding of these models . and indeed , the behavior of wilson - cowan systems in the presence of multiple timescales was still an open problem important to solve since the original wilson - cowan model introduced in 1972 in  @xcite had an intrinsic slow - fast structure that was never explored as such in the literature .",
    "second , this analysis allowed to understand the qualitative role of noise in the dynamics . as was done in  @xcite , we demonstrated here again that the noise did not have a pure disturbing effect on the trajectories but rather a dramatic qualitative effect on the form of the solutions , governing transitions from stationary to periodic behaviors and complex oscillatory behaviors .",
    "of course , the same study would hold in the case of the simpler amari - hopfield model analyzed in  @xcite , where the interaction between neurons is the sum of the firing - rate seen as a sigmoidal transform of the voltage .",
    "these models do not take into account the nonlinearities in the synaptic integration taken into account in wilson - cowan systems .",
    "for such networks , the mean - field equations has gaussian asymptotic solutions , whose mean and standard deviation satisfy a closed set of ordinary differential equations  @xcite . our analysis can easily be extended to such systems , where the limit equations obtained can be shown to have gaussian solution whose mean satisfy the set of odes : @xmath169 where @xmath170 is similar to our effective sigmoid function  [ eq : effectivesigmoid ] and embeds dependence on the noise level @xmath114 . in the presence of multiple timescales , we expect to observe the same kind of phenomena , and a similar dependence on noise levels , and these phenomena may be rigorously demonstrated in the same flavor as we did in the present paper .",
    "such rigorous results as proved in the present manuscript provide a proof of concept of the role of noise in large - scale multiple timescales systems .",
    "the question that may arise is whether similar phenomena arise in networks of excitable elements . in that case",
    ", the rigorous reduction to odes is no more possible , and proving rigorous results amounts studying infinite - dimensional systems given by non - local partial differential equations ( see e.g.  @xcite for a formulation of the problem in excitable systems ) .",
    "however , preliminary numerical explorations of the problem tend to show that the same type of phenomena arise in these systems .",
    "the deep analysis of these systems and the existence of canards and complex oscillations in relationship with noise levels is a direct perspective of this work we are currently analyzing .",
    "another deep problem raised by the present analysis is the systematic characterization of the finite - size effects in bistable regimes .",
    "indeed , we have observed that when there is a unique attractor of the mean - field equations , the finite - sized networks approximated fairly the predicted behavior , whereas in the bistable regime , switches occur randomly between the two attractors , but with a surprising regularity .",
    "using the theory of the fluctuations around the mean - field limits  @xcite , we will explore in depth the origin of this regularity in a forthcoming study .",
    "the results obtained in this paper provide further insight on the role of noise in the dynamics of neuronal networks .",
    "more than a pure perturbation of the trajectories , noise shows to govern the dynamics of the networks , and moreover , the presence of canard explosions further assess that this dependence is extremely sensitive .",
    "this shows that stochastic networks displaying complex oscillations may be related to very finely tuned noise levels .",
    "this fine characterization of the noise may lead to unravel precisely noise levels in large - scale neuronal networks ."
