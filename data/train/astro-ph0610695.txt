    "astronomers observational efforts have led to the detection of more than 160 extra - solar planets ( exoplanets ) .",
    "these discoveries open a new window to astronomy , which could eventually lead to answers to the fundamental questions about the formation of planetary systems , including our solar system .",
    "in fact , some of the work has already been done to address the important questions about planetary evolution .",
    "for example , zakamska & tremaine ( 2004 ) tried to explain the high eccentricities of exoplanets by possible stellar encounters .",
    "( 2002 , 2003 ) have studied the orbital evolutions of a few known resonant planetary systems .",
    "veras & armitage ( 2004 ) proposed the possible mechanisms to make exoplanets migrate outward .",
    "jiang & ip ( 2001 ) investigated the origin of orbital elements of the planetary system of upsilon andromedae .",
    "yeh & jiang ( 2001 ) studied the orbital migration of scattered planets .",
    "jiang & yeh ( 2004a , 2004b ) did some analysis on the orbital evolution of systems with planet - disc interaction .    while the number of detected planets keep increasing , it is important to study the distributions of their masses , periods , and other orbital elements .",
    "the details of these distributions could have crucial implications for the formation and evolution of planetary systems .",
    "it is quite common that we use a simple function , say , a power law , to model the distribution of a quantity in our system ( tabachnik & tremaine 2002 ) .",
    "it also happens that , after a further study , we find that a single power - law is not good enough and we make the change to a double - power - law .",
    "this process will eventually help us to understand the properties of the system .    on the other hand , cluster analysis , which is a data analysis tool to find clusters of a data set with the most similarity in the same cluster and the most dissimilarity between different clusters , might also help us to distinguish a double - power - law from a single power - law for a particular study from another point of view .",
    "when we find that there is only one group ( or a huge number of groups ) through cluster analysis , it is likely that a simple function ( say , a single power - law ) could be a good approximation .",
    "when there are two or more groups in cluster analysis , we might need a combination of several functions ( say , double - power - law ) to model the data set . in this way , we can be more confident of the results derived from the usual conventional process .",
    "another advantage of cluster analysis is that it can also be used to study the distributions of multi - variables easily .",
    "clustering is a powerful exploratory approach to find groups in data and to reveal the structure information of a given data set .",
    "it is a data driven procedure to classify a datum in one of a few classes by looking at proximity and homogeneity in feature space .",
    "conventional approaches to clustering can be grouped into two categories namely partitional and hierarchical .",
    "the @xmath7-means ( see macqueen 1967 , hartigan 1975 ) algorithm is a popular example of partitional clustering whereby the data is partitioned into @xmath7 classes with the value of @xmath7 known a priori .",
    "single linkage algorithm ( gower and ross 1969 , hartigan 1967 ) is an example of hierarchical agglomerative clustering where for @xmath8 data a hierarchy of clusters ranging from @xmath8 to @xmath9 is formed .",
    "the single linkage algorithm was used in asteroid studies ( zappala et al . 1995 ) and in many meteoroid stream searches ( baggaley & galligan 1997 , galligan 2003a , galligan 2003b ) .",
    "zappala et al .",
    "( 1995 ) identified the dynamical families from a sample of 12,487 asteroids .",
    "they divided the main asteroid belt into three different zones ( the inner , intermediate , and outer zone ) and study the hierarchical structures of the orbital families .",
    "baggaley & galligan ( 1997 ) first used the single linkage algorithm to work on meteoroid stream data from the advanced meteoroid orbit radar ( amor ) .",
    "they probed the structure of the orbital distributions and determined the extent of dynamical families or clusters in the population .",
    "moreover , in order to determine a reasonable cut - off level , they also introduced the combination of the single - linkage method with a randomization technique .",
    "galligan ( 2003a , 2003b ) further studied more recent amor data by these methods .    from the previous work",
    ", we can see that the cut - off level in the conventional single linkage method would influence the results of clustering and therefore the number of clusters . in section 2 , we first briefly review the single linkage algorithm .",
    "we then review the much more advanced method called the similarity - based clustering method ( scm ) proposed by yang & wu ( 2004 ) in section 3 . some numerical examples and comparisons between the single linkage algorithm and the scm",
    "are made in section 4 .",
    "section 5 starts our applications of the single linkage algorithm and the scm on the data of exoplanets .",
    "the implications of these results on the formation and evolution of planetary systems will also be given in section 5 .",
    "section 6 concludes the paper .",
    "the clustering process begins with measures of the distance of the objects from one another .",
    "several measures are available , but we shall use simple euclidean distance in most cases . usually , the distances can be summarized in a symmetric @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the euclidean distance between objects @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we illustrate the single linkage algorithm with the artificial distance matrix given by johnson & wichern ( 1988 ) @xmath15.\\ ] ] the minimum distance occurs between objects @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so the first cluster , labelled as ( 35 ) , will consist of those objects . the second matrix of distances is formed by deleting the rows and columns of @xmath18 corresponding to objects @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and adding a row and column with the distances of the remaining objects from the cluster ( 35 ) .",
    "those distances are found from the rule @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 the minimum distance in the second matrix is @xmath22 and we merge cluster ( 1 ) with cluster ( 35 ) to get the next cluster , ( 135 ) .",
    "next , we form a third distance matrix : for it we note that @xmath23 @xmath24 the minimum distance in the third matrix is @xmath25 and we merge objects 4 and 2 to get the cluster ( 24 ) . at this time we have two distinct clusters , ( 135 ) and ( 24 ) .",
    "their minimum distance is @xmath26 therefore , clusters ( 135 ) and ( 24 ) are merged to form a single cluster of all five objects , ( 12345 ) , when the minimum distance reaches 6 .",
    "the clusters are illustrated in the dendrogram of fig .",
    "the dendrogram is formed by plotting the minimum distances for each cluster in a tree configuration leading to the single cluster of all @xmath17 objects .",
    "the objects should be ordered so that the branches of the dendrogram stand alone without crossing .",
    "the dendrogram clearly suggests that the sample may contain two sets of objects : @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    in general , single linkage algorithm , which combines the original @xmath8 single - object clusters hierarchically into one cluster of @xmath8 objects ,",
    "cab be summarized as :    0.1truein * single linkage algorithm *    * start with @xmath8 single - object clusters .",
    "the distances are described by the initial distance matrix @xmath11 . * search for the nearest pair of clusters from the distance matrix .",
    "when there are more than one candidate pairs , randomly pick one of them . let the distance between this pair of clusters , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , be @xmath31 , where @xmath32 * merge clusters @xmath29 and @xmath30 . label the newly formed cluster as @xmath33 .",
    "form a new distance matrix by ( i ) deleting the rows and columns corresponding to clusters @xmath29 and @xmath30 and ( ii ) adding a row and column giving the distances between cluster @xmath33 and the remaining clusters .",
    "the distances between cluster @xmath33 and any other cluster @xmath34 are computed by @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the distances between clusters @xmath29 and @xmath34 and clusters @xmath30 and @xmath34 , as defined in s2 . * repeat s2 and s3 .",
    "all objects will be in a single cluster at the termination of the algorithm .",
    "record the identity of clusters that are merged and the levels at which the mergers take place .",
    "the above clustering results of single linkage algorithm can be graphically displayed in the form of a dendrogram , which shows the clustering structure at various levels of the hierarchy .",
    "the branches in the tree represent clusters .",
    "the branches come together ( merge ) at nodes whose positions along a distance axis indicate the level at which the fusions occur . therefore , the vertical axis indicates the distance and the horizontal axis simply shows the data identity numbers .",
    "please note that the dendrogram plotted in baggaley & galligan ( 1997 ) is slightly different from what we just described here . in their plot , the meaning of the horizontal axis is different from ours . due to the huge number of orbits ,",
    "their horizontal axis shows the scale of number of clustering members .",
    "the meaning of their vertical axis is the same as ours .",
    "let the data set be @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a feature vector in the @xmath40-dimensional euclidean space @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the specified number of clusters .",
    "yang and wu ( 2004 ) considered maximizing the objective function @xmath43 with @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the similarity measure between @xmath39 and the @xmath13th cluster center @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the euclidean norm , @xmath48 and @xmath49    since the clustering result is influenced by @xmath50 , yang and wu ( 2004 ) proposed correlation comparison algorithm ( cca ) to select @xmath50 .",
    "according to the fact that the parameter @xmath50 controls the location of the peaks of @xmath43 , they considered the total similarity function @xmath51 for each data point @xmath52 with @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "the correlation between the values of @xmath51 and @xmath56 are calculated .",
    "that is , cca is based on a correlation comparison procedure with `` @xmath57 '' , `` @xmath58 '' , `` @xmath59 '' , @xmath60 etc .",
    "the cca then is summarized as follows :    0.1truein * correlation comparison algorithm ( cca ) *    * set @xmath61 and give a threshold @xmath62 .",
    "* calculate the correlation of the values of @xmath51 and @xmath56 . *",
    "if the correlation is greater than or equal to the threshold @xmath62 * then choose @xmath63 to be the estimate of @xmath50 ; * else @xmath64 and goto s2 .",
    "since yang and wu ( 2004 ) suggested a threshold around @xmath65 , we choose 0.99 for the threshold in this paper .",
    "after the parameter @xmath50 is estimated using cca , the next step is to find a @xmath46 that maximizes the scm objective function @xmath43 .",
    "differentiating @xmath43 with respect to all @xmath46 , we obtain @xmath66 and set ( 2 ) to zero .",
    "the necessary condition that maximizes @xmath67 is @xmath68 this necessary condition can be decomposed into two conditions .",
    "first , we take the similarity relation @xmath69 with @xmath70 and then the necessary condition ( 3 ) becomes @xmath71 this forms the similarity clustering algorithm ( sca ) .",
    "thus , after the cca is implemented to get an estimate @xmath50 , the sca will be used to find the peaks of the scm objective function is then summarized as follows :    0.1truein * similarity clustering algorithm ( sca ) *    * initialize @xmath72 and give @xmath73 ; * set iteration counter @xmath74 ; * estimate @xmath75 by eq.(4 ) ; * estimate @xmath76 by eq.(5 ) ; * increment @xmath77 ; until latexmath:[$\\displaystyle\\max_i     when one processes sca , all the cluster centers , @xmath46 , will change positions for each iteration .",
    "if the data set has only one peak on the scm objective function , all the centers will gradually centralize to that unique peak .",
    "in this case , we will claim there is only one cluster for this data set .",
    "when the data set has more than one peak on the scm objective function , we can randomly give more initial cluster centers to process sca and these centers will then centralize to the peaks of the scm objective function .",
    "the problem here is what kind of the initialization can guarantee that all peaks ( clusters ) will be found simultaneously . to solve this problem , yang and wu ( 2004 ) suggested to set all data points to be the initial centers ( i.e. , @xmath79 .",
    "they successfully showed that all peaks ( clusters ) will be found for this initialization .",
    "next , we present an example to illustrate the cca and sca . in the data set of fig .",
    "2 , there are one large cluster and two small clusters . by the cca , we find that @xmath80 is a good estimate",
    ". then we process sca with this data set by initializing @xmath81 .",
    "we show the positions of these cluster centers after 1 , 5 and 10 iterations as the full circles in fig . 3 and the left of fig .",
    "4 , respectively .",
    "the final convergent positions of all cluster centers are shown as the full circles in the right of fig .",
    "4 . please note that all the data points , @xmath82 , are also plotted as the dots in fig . 3 and 4 .",
    "it is obvious that there are only three full circles because all cluster centers centralize to the three peaks of the scm objective function .",
    "there are three clusters for this data set by the view of sight",
    ". however , a precise method to determine the cluster number from these final @xmath8 cluster centers should be provided .",
    "we use the single linkage algorithm with the final positions of all cluster centers to find the optimal cluster number @xmath83 .",
    "the result is shown as the dendrogram in the left panel of fig .",
    "this dendrogram clearly indicates that there are three well separated clusters and hence the optimal cluster number @xmath84 . at the same time the identified clusters will be found .",
    "the identified clusters are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "therefore , we can completely cluster the data set in fig . 2 into three clusters shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the process includes that : ( i ) process cca to estimate the parameter @xmath50 , ( ii ) process sca with @xmath81 , and ( iii ) process the single linkage algorithm with the final positions of @xmath8 cluster centers to find the optimal cluster number @xmath83 and identify these @xmath83 clusters .",
    "this forms the structure of scm which is summarized as follows :    0.1truein * similarity - based clustering method ( scm ) *    * estimate @xmath50 using cca ; * process sca with @xmath81 ; * process the single linkage algorithm with the final @xmath8 cluster centers ; * find the optimal cluster number @xmath83 according to the dendrogram ; * identify these @xmath83 clusters .",
    "in this section , we consider the bivariate normal mixtures of three classes in order to assess the performance of the single linkage algorithm and scm .",
    "let @xmath85 represent the bivariate normal with mean vector @xmath86 and covariance matrix @xmath87 , we consider the random sample of data drawn from @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath90 .",
    "we design various bivariate normal mixture distributions shown in table 1 . in each test",
    ", we consider the sample size @xmath91 ."
