    "progress in understanding the physical nature of dark energy will require precision measurements of the expansion history of the universe over the redshift range 0@xmath2@xmath3@xmath24 . in order to make progress towards this goal ,",
    "very significant surveys involving new facilities are required .",
    "two approaches are being pursued : to refine the accuracy of the measurement at low redshift , including constraints on possible evolution of the dark energy equation of state , or to constrain dark energy evolution , directly , through observations at high redshift .",
    "hetdex has the goal of providing percent - level constraints on the expansion history of the universe ( the hubble parameter @xmath4 and angular diameter distance @xmath5 ) over redshifts @xmath3=1.9 to 3.5 .",
    "hetdex will use a combination of baryonic acoustic oscillations ) and power spectrum shape information to provide at least a 3-@xmath6 direct detection of dark energy over these redshifts , even in the event that dark energy is a cosmological constant . to achieve this",
    ", hetdex needs an accuracy of 0.9% on @xmath4 at @xmath3=2.8 .",
    "this level of accuracy requires a volume of 9 gpc@xmath7 with a density of tracers @xmath1@xmath8 objects per mpc@xmath7 , which can be achieved by surveying 420 deg@xmath0 over 1.9@xmath2@xmath3@xmath23.5 with 0.8 million lyman-@xmath9 emitting ( lae ) galaxies .",
    "laes have high number density and are easily detected with integral field spectroscopy ( as shown in sec .",
    "in addition to a direct detection of dark energy , a 0.9% measurement of @xmath10 at @xmath3=@xmath11 from hetdex will determine curvature to 0.10.2% a factor of ten better than currently known .",
    "nearly all of the other dark energy missions require some knowledge of curvature to disentangle the dark energy contribution .",
    "this is because at low redshifts , dark energy and curvature provide the same expansion signature .",
    "hetdex has three aspects : an upgrade to the het , the instrument virus , and the observing and analysis campaign .",
    "the het has pioneered an optical design with a fixed spherical primary and a tracker to follow the motions of objects .",
    "the design is particularly effective for surveys .",
    "the wide field upgrade is needed to increase the science field - of - view from 4  to 22 .",
    "this entails a new corrector , tracker , and instrument package .",
    "the survey necessary to realize the desired constraints for hetdex is a significant undertaking , and requires a telescope / spectrograph combination which can acquire the data an order of magnitude faster than current spectrographs . for such surveys to be tractable ,",
    "a new approach to instrumentation is needed . industrial replication ,",
    "promises the multiplex gains required for the next generation of instruments on very large telescopes .",
    "the * v*isible * i*ntegral - field * r*eplicable * u*nit * s*pectrograph ( virus ) consists of 150 integral - field spectrographs .",
    "each virus module has a fiber - coupled ifu feeding a pair of simple unit spectrographs .",
    "the virus design is described in more detail in .",
    "each virus unit is fed by 224 fibers that each cover 1.8 arcsec@xmath0 on the sky .",
    "the fibers feeding a two - unit module are arrayed in a 50@xmath1250 square arcseconds ifu with a 1@xmath133 fill - factor .",
    "a dither pattern of three exposures fills in the area .",
    "the spectral resolution is 5.7 , with coverage of 350550  nm .",
    "the optical design is simple , using three reflective and two refractive elements . with dielectric reflective coatings optimized for the wavelength range",
    ", high throughput is obtained .",
    "the full virus array will simultaneously obtain 33,600 spectra with 12  million resolution elements .",
    "the ifus are arrayed within the 22  field of view of the upgraded het with @xmath11@xmath137 fill factor , sufficent to detect the required density of laes for hetdex .",
    "development is proceeding with the prototype ( virus - p , ) , deployed in october 2006 , and pre - production prototype where value engineering is being used to reduce the cost for production .",
    "the hetdex observing campaign will take about 1400 hours on the het ( dependent on the still poorly understood properties of laes ) , which we estimate to require about 3 years to complete .",
    "accurate measurements of the lae luminosity function at @xmath14 and 4 are now available from narrow - band imaging surveys and some spectroscopy to confirm candidates .",
    "these studies currently probe insufficient volume to measure the correlation function and bias of the laes , and they do not extend to the lower redshifts probed by hetdex . to understand the properties of laes in more detail , to measure the contaminating fraction of low redshift galaxies , and to demonstrate the power of integral field spectroscopy for selecting large samples , we have started a pilot survey using virus - p on the mcdonald 2.7  m. we are targeting the munics - deep , cosmos , and goods - n fields , where deep imaging and other supporting data exist , allowing us to characterize the properties of detected emission - line objects .",
    "virus - p is ideal for this investigation , as the ifu covers 3.5 arcmin@xmath0 when fed at f/3.65 f - ratio .",
    "the individual fibers are 4.1  diameter , but the sensitivity is adequate to detect significant numbers of laes , even on a 2  m class telescope . in comparison to narrow - band imaging surveys ,",
    "virus - p covers a wide redshift range , down to the uncharacterized @xmath3@xmath15@xmath16 epoch , and it surveys volume quickly .    to date in 80 nights , we have covered 115 arcmin@xmath0 or 7.5x10@xmath17 cubic mpc co - moving volume , reaching 5 - 6x10@xmath18 erg / cm@xmath0/s line flux ( 5-@xmath6 ) in 2 hours exposure .",
    "figure 1 presents an example lae spectrum .",
    "analysis of 40 arcmin@xmath0 in cosmos yields 99 emission - line objects ( 45 secure laes , 43 low redshift galaxies , one agn , and 10 sources that are yet to be confirmed as laes ) .",
    "separation of laes from [ oii ] emitters is based on the deep imaging available for the targeted fields .",
    "an imaging survey of moderate depth ( ab@xmath125 ) is needed to separate the two populations , based on emission - line equivalent width .",
    "we are detecting significant numbers of laes at @xmath3@xmath12 .",
    "comparison of the number detected with the expected redshift distribution , based on the measured throughput of the instrument and a non - evolving @xmath3@xmath13 luminosity function , already gives hints about lae evolution .",
    "an increase in the galaxy luminosity function derived from uv and ir continuum measurements of about a factor of two is seen between redshifts @xmath3@xmath14 and 2 .",
    "current data from the pilot survey are consistent with this trend , but analysis of the full dataset will be required for significant results .",
    "the pilot survey has proven the approach of wide - area integral field spectroscopy for hetdex and has tested the data reduction pipeline . in another year",
    "observing we expect to refine the properties of laes needed for the full survey .",
    "with 2@xmath133 of the budget raised , hetdex officially started in september 2007 . following the science requirments review in june 2007 and preliminary design review in april 2008 ,",
    "the project is now in the 3-year build - phase .",
    "hetdex is a collaboration between the university of texas at austin , max - planck - institut fr extraterrestrische physik , universitt - sternwarte munich , astrophysikalisches institut potsdam , pennsylvania state university , texas a&m university , stanford university , and georg - august universitaet gttingen .",
