    "the importance of retinal photoisomerization has made its mechanism the subject of numerous experimental and computational studies . a related biological process , _ cis - trans _ isomerization in retinoic acid , has become of increasing interest in its role in zebrafish hindbrain development@xcite .    to study retinal dynamics ,",
    "current pump - probe experiments use ultrashort femtosecond laser pulses to excite the retinal from the ground ( @xmath2 to the first excited ( @xmath3 ) electronic state .",
    "the subsequent isomerization dynamics is then followed using a series of probe pulses , providing important insights into the sub-200 fs timescale of photoproduct formation @xcite , the coherent dynamics of all-_trans _ photoproduct @xcite , and most recently , the role of conical intersections in determining the reaction rate @xcite .",
    "significantly , retinal photoisomerization occurs with high quantum yield ( @xmath4 ) , making the first step in visual phototransduction highly efficient @xcite .",
    "measurements of the quantum yield @xmath5 as a function of excitation wavelength @xmath6 show a maximum at 500 nm and a small decline of @xmath75% as the laser wavelength increases from 500 nm to 570 nm @xcite .    a detailed time - dependent computational study of retinal photoisomerization using a multilevel redfield theory @xcite based on a minimal two - state , two - mode ( 2d ) model of retinal chromophore@xcite provided insights into the role of avoided crossings , conical intersections , and dissipative dynamics in ultrafast energy conversion in biomolecules @xcite .",
    "in addition , they qualitatively reproduce many salient features of isomerization dynamics of retinal in rhodopsin , including the high quantum yield . there and elsewhere",
    "the quantum yield is defined dynamically , as the probability of forming the all-_trans _ product starting from the initial _ cis _ wavepacket created by an ultrafast franck - condon excitation from the ground _",
    "cis _ state .",
    "this time - dependent wavepacket view @xcite is well - suited to describe time - domain experiments on rhodopsin , in which ultrafast @xmath8 excitation creates a wavepacket on a highly excited state .",
    "however , in nature , the excitation involves natural light .",
    "such light has a very short coherence time ( 1.32 fs for sunlight ) compared to the fs laser pulses used experimentally @xcite , and is incident on the molecule for a far longer time . as a result ,",
    "after some time , which is dependent on a number of conditions@xcite , the molecule is prepared in a mixture of stationary states that exhibits no coherent time evolution@xcite .",
    "furthermore , these stationary states are , from a zeroth - order viewpoint , a linear superposition of _ cis _ and _ trans _ configurations . the existence and some unusual properties ( such as microsecond lifetimes ) of stationary eigenstates of this kind in large polyatomic molecules",
    "were examined experimentally as early as 1977 @xcite .",
    "the questions then arise as to how to extract and understand the quantum yield in the case of incoherent light excitation , and how to describe the _ cis - trans _ isomerization of retinal from a stationary eigenstate viewpoint that is appropriate for vision under natural light conditions .",
    "a substantial step towards this major goal is provided in this paper .    here",
    ", we address this issue by first generalizing the concept of the quantum yield to the case of incoherent light excitation of a polyatomic molecule .",
    "we note that in the limit of rapid decoherence of initial coherences in the reduced density matrix , the photoreaction quantum yield is stationary .",
    "this definition is then applied to calculate the quantum yield of _ cis - trans _ photoisomerization of retinal using a minimal two - state , two - mode model@xcite .",
    "we find excellent overall agreement between our calculated quantum yield and the previous time - dependent result of stock and hahn @xcite .",
    "in addition , our calculations , in both the presence and absence of relaxation , agree with the observed value of the quantum yield at 500 nm and qualitatively reproduce its observed decline with increasing excitation wavelength @xcite .",
    "these findings demonstrate the role of localization properties of the stationary states in determining the quantum yields , a crucial feature in the process induced with natural light .",
    "note that there are various definitions of the quantum yield that are adopted in time - dependent studies .",

    "this imposes a number of consistency requirements that are discussed in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .    before proceeding further",
    ", we emphasize that incoherent excitation of biomolecules embedded in condensed - phase environments involves two processes that occur simultaneously : ( a ) the creation of the stationary states by the incoherent light , and ( b ) the relaxation between the stationary states caused by the interaction with the environment . in this work ,",
    "we treat these processes sequentially , assuming that the stationary states are formed first and then relax due to the system - environment coupling .",
    "this allows for a better assessment of their individual roles .",
    "the eigenstates formed on stage ( a ) are considered in secs .",
    "ii and iii ; the effects of relaxation are considered in sec .",
    "iv and , significantly , shown to have a negligible effect on the quantum yield of retinal photoisomerization treated within in the two - state , two - mode model @xcite .",
    "the results , as seen below , motivate a future study of simultaneous incoherent excitation and relaxation in this and related model retinal systems .",
    "we extract the quantum yield for the stationary case from the standard time dependent result , hence exposing their relationship .",

    "alternative definitions [ e.g. , including @xmath23 in the numerator and @xmath24 in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ y ] ) ] are certainly possible and will be explored in future work @xcite , and would necessitate a refitting of the potential parameters to the new definition of the time - dependent quantum yield .",
    "as an example , consider impulsive fc excitation of retinal from its ground electronic and vibrational states to the first excited electronic state @xmath25 . here the density matrix of the system at time zero is given by @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the ground state with zero quanta in the torsional and coupling modes @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",

    "hence the population dynamics is given by @xmath35    since the time - dependence arises from the oscillatory behavior of the coherences , ( i.e. , terms with @xmath36 ) , if @xmath37 then the state populations are time independent .",
    "an important example of such a case is molecular excitation with incoherent light [ eq .",
    "( [ p1t_trans ] ) ] , which populates , after some time , the eigenstates of @xmath38 without any subsequent coherent dynamics @xcite .",
    "similarly , environmentally induced effects cause the loss of coherences . in this case , retaining only the diagonal terms in eq .",
    "( [ p1t_trans ] ) , we have @xmath39    this expression may be made more physically transparent by noting that the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix following impulsive fc excitation at @xmath40 correspond to the linear absorption spectrum of the molecule described by the spectral lineshape function @xcite @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the excitation frequency measured from the ground vibrational state of the _ cis_-isomer with energy @xmath43 ( we assume that this is the only vibrational state populated prior to excitation )",

    "specifically , the pre - averaged definition ( [ qy1 ] ) is consistent with the original definition of hahn and stock [ eq .

    "cis_-region of the first excited diabatic state , which maximizes its overlap with the ground _",
    "cis_-state , to enhance excitation .",
    "the lower - lying states @xmath156 and @xmath157 start to experience the repulsive wall of the @xmath158 diabatic potential in the _ cis_-region of configuration space ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . as a result ,",
    "the population is completely transferred away from the repulsive region to the ground _",
    "cis _ and excited _ trans _ regions .",
    "there is no apparent preference for either _ cis _ or _ trans _ regions during these initial relaxation stages due to the strong mixing of all degree of freedom : as shown in fig .",
    "4(a ) , both @xmath21 and @xmath22 increase monotonically with time .    after being transferred one step below below the initial state , the population continues to relax to lower - lying eigenstates while preserving its profile along the reaction coordinate .",
    "this can be attributed to the particular form of the system - bath coupling , which primarily depends on the @xmath59 coordinate and hence does not strongly alter the @xmath55-profiles of the eigenstates coupled by the bath .",
    "in particular , we verified that the amount of _ cis _ and _ trans _ character of most of the states involved in the relaxation process is approximately constant .",
    "exceptions do occur because of the strong vibronic coupling , which may occasionally change the @xmath55 distribution of some eigenstates due to the coupling mediated by the @xmath59 coordinate .",
    "however , this situation is an exception rather than the rule : as shown in fig .",
    "8 , only two out of @xmath720 eigenstates involved in the first stage of relaxation ( @xmath159 and @xmath160 ) are dramatically different in their _ trans_-character ( as quantified by the matrix element @xmath161 ) from the other states . as a result ,",
    "the quantum yield varies only weakly with time .",
    "a dramatic change in the relaxation mechanism occurs when the eigenstate energy falls below that of the conical intersection .",
    "figure 9 shows that the eigenstates to which relaxation then occurs become localized in their corresponding _",
    "cis- _ and _ trans_- wells .",
    "the population of the initial ( delocalized ) eigenstate @xmath162 relaxes to two eigenstates , one of which ( @xmath163 ) is strongly localized in the _ trans_-well and the other ( @xmath164 ) has more probability amplitude in the _ cis_-well ( see supplementary material @xcite ) . as the population gets partitioned between the two eigenstates , the quantum yield remains unaltered again due to the @xmath55-independent nature of the system - bath coupling , which tends to conserve the angular probability density of all eigenstates involved .    finally , we consider the final stages of the relaxation process depicted in fig .",
    "9 . these represent bath - induced transitions between localized eigenstates , and can be understood by noting that the eigenstates are given to zeroth order by eq .",
    "( [ zeroth_order ] ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us assume that the value of the quantum yield before relaxation begins is determined by a single eigenstate @xmath165 .",
    "after relaxation is over , the population is transferred to the eigenstate @xmath166 .",
    "taking the matrix elements of @xmath146 and using eq .",
    "( [ zeroth_order ] ) , we find @xmath167 because @xmath146 does not depend on @xmath59 , and similarly @xmath168 but the system - bath coupling operator does not depend on @xmath55 , and hence can not change the number of quanta in the torsional mode @xmath169 , so the right - hand sides of eqs .",
    "( [ loc1 ] ) and ( [ loc2 ] ) are equal .",
    "this result suggests that in the low - energy regime of localized eigenstates , the quantum yield of _ any _ process that depends on a single reaction coordinate should be time - independent , provided that the system - bath coupling does not depend on that coordinate .",
    "this is clearly illustrated in fig .",
    "9 : the localized state @xmath163 has 3 peaks along the @xmath59 coordinate , corresponding to 2 quanta in the @xmath59-mode ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "the system - bath coupling changes @xmath171 from 2 to 1 and then from 1 to 0 , while leaving the @xmath55 distribution unchanged ( see also figs . 1 and 2 of supplementary material @xcite ) .",
    "the final eigenstate @xmath172 is vibrationally `` cold '' with respect to the coupling mode , but remains highly excited along the torsional coordinate .    a few closing remarks are in order concerning the asymptotic ( @xmath139 ) value of the quantum yield that corresponds to the population distribution shown in the lowermost panel in fig .",
    "the steady state is obtained by propagating the rate equations of motion for the populations , which is a numerically efficient procedure that scales quadratically with the number of eigenstates @xcite .",
    "the nature of the steady state is determined by the form of the system - bath coupling , and the initial conditions .",
    "we emphasize that this steady - state solution does _ not _ have the form of the boltzmann distribution that would be normally expected of pauli - type rate equations in the limit @xmath139 @xcite .",
    "rather , in accord with ref . , our steady - state distribution corresponds to a metastable state , which will eventually tunnel to the _ cis_-well ( at least if the well is one - dimensional ) . the large barrier height in the two - state two - mode model makes the tunneling timescale extremely long compared to any other timescale of interest in this system . as a possible direction of future research",
    ", it would be interesting to explore whether such metastable steady states can be obtained without propagating the dynamical equations of motion .",
    "if so , the determination of the quantum yield from the stationary eigenstates becomes a straightforward task via eq .",
    "( [ qy1 ] ) with the matrix elements @xmath108 replaced by their steady - state values .",
    "we have considered a time - independent approach to the quantum yield of _ cis - trans _ photoisomerization , here applied to model retinal in rhodopsin .",
    "the need for this approach arises due to the recognition that natural processes take place in incoherent light ( e.g. , sunlight with a coherence time of 1.32 fs ) and environmental decoherence , which produce mixtures of stationary hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "here we have recast one of the standard time - dependent definitions of the quantum yield in terms of time - independent quantities , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and associated dipole transition matrix elements . the quantum yield",
    "is then shown to be a direct reflection of the _ cis _ vs. _ trans _ character of the individual stationary eigenstates of the system and the associated dipole transition matrix elements from the ground electronic state .",
    "further , applied to a model of retinal , this approach gives excellent results for the quantum yield , fully in agreement with experiment .",
    "interestingly , relaxation from the initially prepared stationary mixture does not alter the quantum yield , a consequence of both the _ cis / trans _ partitioning of the stationary states and the system - bath coupling in this well established minimalist model of retinal isomerization .",
    "ideally , we should consider a full treatment of all modes of retinal in a proper rhodopsin environment , define the quantum yield and other observable properties , fit the retinal potential parameters to experiment , and compare time - dependent computational results to the stationary state results associated with incoherent light excitation .",
    "however , such and extensive computational study is not required to support the main result of this paper , i.e. , that the stationary eigenstates of the system hamiltonian provide an alternative and important way to understand features affecting the quantum yield in incoherent light .",
    "rather , we adopt the basic two - dimensional model of hahn and stock @xcite . restricting attention to this model",
    "necessitates , by requirements of consistency , that if we adopt their two - dimensional potentials and associated system parameter fits to experimental data , that we also must maintain their definition of quantum yield , with the associated neglect of @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "alternative definitions of the quantum yield would have resulted in different values of the system parameter fits and different stationary eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "hence , the successful computational results demonstrated here do motivate a more extensive calculation of retinal hamiltonian eigenstates for a retinal model including all degrees of freedom@xcite .",
