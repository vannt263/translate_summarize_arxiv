    "as @xmath0he beams with high energy resolution and intensity became available at different radioactive ion beam facilities around the world , these unstable helium isotopes are among the most studied light neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "ever since the pioneering measurement of the interaction cross section in the late eighties @xcite which lead to the discovery of the extended density distribution of the valence halo neutrons in @xmath0he , many recent experimental efforts are still focused on a more precise determination of the nuclear radii and radial shape of these nuclei by different methods @xcite . the elastic proton scattering in inverse kinematics at energies around 700 mev has been proven to be an accurate method to obtain information on the nuclear density distributions of the halo nuclei under study @xcite .",
    "the first experiment on the ( inverse kinematics ) elastic proton scattering on @xmath0he at energies around 700 mev has been performed at gsi darmstadt using the hydrogen - filled ionization chamber ikar which simultaneously served as a gas target and a detector for the recoil protons @xcite , and the measured elastic scattering data were analyzed within the glauber model @xcite to deduce the matter radii and radial shape of the nuclear density distributions of these nuclei @xcite .",
    "these same data were also studied in a glauber few - body calculation of the elastic 68 scattering @xcite , where the few - body degrees of freedom were treated explicitly .",
    "we note that the first measurement @xcite has covered only the region of low momentum transfer because the ikar active target was limited to the detection of recoil ions close to @xmath3 .",
    "recently , a new experimental setup has been designed to study proton induced reactions on the exotic nuclei in inverse kinematics using a liquid hydrogen target adapted to obtain low - background data @xcite .",
    "the new setup was successfully used to measure the elastic 68 scattering at energies around 700 mev / nucleon , and the measured cross section has been extended to the region of higher momentum transfer as compared to the previous experiments .",
    "we note that the considered 68 data @xcite were originally deduced in terms of the scattering cross section versus the 4-momentum transfer squared ( @xmath4 ) . for a comparison between the results of different models , it is more convenient to use the elastic 68 scattering cross section versus the scattering angle ( @xmath5 ) in the center - of - momentum ( c.m . )",
    "the two cross sections are expressed through each other by the relativistic kinematics @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the 4-momentum transfer squared and c.m .",
    "momentum , respectively . in terms of the scattering angles ,",
    "the new data points measured at high momentum transfer @xcite have reached the angular region around the first diffractive minimum ( see fig .  [ f1 ] ) , and should be , therefore , more sensitive to the inner radial part of the ground - state densities of the @xmath0he nuclei .",
    "the ( first ) diffractive minimum was observed at @xmath9 in the @xmath10he+@xmath1 and @xmath11he+@xmath1 data taken at high momentum transfer .    in the present work ,",
    "the elastic @xmath0he+@xmath1 scattering data under study have been analyzed within the glauber multiple - scattering model ( gmsm ) using the same phenomenological parametrizations of the matter densities of @xmath0he as those used in the earlier gmsm analyses of the gsi data @xcite . because the two measurements of refs .",
    "@xcite were done practically at the same energy , it is possible to combine these two data sets in the present gmsm analysis .",
    "the basic formalism of the gmsm has been given in details in ref .",
    "the gmsm was successfully used in refs .",
    "@xcite to analyze the elastic @xmath0he+@xmath1 scattering data measured at low momentum transfer , and to deduce the nuclear matter density distributions for these nuclei .",
    "however , the gmsm calculations in refs .  @xcite were performed without taking into account the spin - orbital ( s / o ) interaction , because the s / o effects were known to be negligible at the most forward angles ( low momentum transfer ) @xcite .",
    "given the new data measured at high momentum transfer which cover the first diffractive minimum , the s / o effects should be significant and can no more be neglected ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "23 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the present work ,",
    "the formalism of the gmsm that takes into account the s / o interaction has been used in the analysis of the new @xmath0he+@xmath1 data .",
    "the elastic scattering cross section is determined from the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath12 as @xmath13 in general , the scattering amplitude can be written as @xcite @xmath14\\right\\ } \\rho_a(\\bm r_1 , \\bm r_2 , ... , \\bm r_a ) \\prod\\limits_{j = 1}^a d^3r_jd^2b .",

    "such a procedure is exact for the nucleon distributions of gaussian form , and also expected to be accurate for the cases of non - gaussian distributions @xcite .",
    "like the previous gmsm studies @xcite , we have used in the present analysis several density models that divide explicitly the nuclear many - body density @xmath18 into the core @xmath19 and halo @xmath20 parts , so that @xmath21 the representation ( [ den_ch ] ) of the many - body density neglects the correlations between the nucleon locations , with a constraint that the positions of the core and halo nucleons are treated explicitly . in other cases ,",
    "the nuclear many - body density has been simply assumed as a product of the one - body matter densities @xmath22 @xmath23    in the notations of eq .",
    "( [ amp ] ) , @xmath24 is the impact parameter , @xmath25 is the momentum transfer , and @xmath26 is the nuclear mass number . the proton - nucleon ( @xmath27 ) profile function @xmath28 is determined from the amplitude @xmath29 of the free @xmath27 scattering as @xmath30 in difference from refs .",
    "@xcite , the present gmsm calculation adopts the following parametrization of @xmath29 that takes into account also the s / o interaction @xmath31 here , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the central and s / o parts of the @xmath27 scattering amplitude , @xmath34 is the pauli spin operator .",
    "we have parametrized the @xmath35 amplitude in the same way as in refs .",
    "@xcite , taking into account explicitly the isotopic difference between the total neutron and proton cross sections .",
    "thus , one has @xmath36 here @xmath37 is the total @xmath27 cross section , parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39 give the ratios of the real and imaginary strengths , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the slope parameters , @xmath42 is the relative strength of the s / o amplitude , and @xmath43 is the nucleon mass .    in the present work we have assumed the same parameters for the central amplitude @xmath44 as those used earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , except the slope parameters @xmath40 that were fine tuned to obtain the best description of the elastic 4 data at @xmath45 mev @xcite in the gmsm calculation that takes into account the s / o interaction explicitly .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath40 values used in ref .",
    "@xcite were adjusted to the best gmsm description of the same 4 data without taking into account the s / o term .",
    "thus , @xmath40 and parameters of the s / o term have been readjusted in the present work to the best description of the elastic 4 data at 700 mev , as shown in fig .",
    "all the parameters used in the present gmsm calculation are given in table  [ t1 ] , with the newly obtained @xmath46 , and @xmath39 values being quite close to those suggested earlier in ref .",

    "the gmsm results shown in fig .",
    "[ he4 ] agree also with the fully quantal optical model results given by the complex 4 optical potential obtained from the folding model calculation @xcite using the same gaussian density for @xmath48he and finite - range t - matrix interaction by franey and love @xcite .",
    "this validates the parameters chosen for the present gmsm calculation .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     because the core is an @xmath49-cluster , the matter , proton and neutron radii of the core nucleus can be assumed equal @xmath50 fm @xcite .",
    "using these values and @xmath17 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 radii given by the present gmsm analysis with the gg and go density models , the radii of the geometry shown in fig .  [ geometry ] can be determined @xcite as .",

    "@xcite . despite the simplicity",
    ", the considered geometrical model gives a good illustration of the core movement inside a 2-neutron halo nucleus , which can be estimated by the difference between the core matter radius and that of the free core nucleus .",
    "for the @xmath49-core this is just the difference between the proton radius of the free @xmath49-particle and that of the considered halo nucleus because protons are distributed in the @xmath49-core only . in a similar manner",
    ", one might suggest the geometry for @xmath11he , but in this case 4 halo neutrons are distributed uniformly against the @xmath49-core , and the polarizing contributions of the valence neutrons to the motion of the @xmath49-core should be weaker than that found in the case of @xmath10he . a direct consequence is a smaller core radius of @xmath11he compared to that of @xmath10he as found in the present gmsm analysis . it is noted that the @xmath11he geometry can be considered to have 2 halo neutrons @xcite . in this case , the same procedure is applied to determine the nuclear radii as discussed above but now the compact core is @xmath10he .",
    "the detailed gmsm analysis of the latest experimental data of the elastic 68 scattering at 717 and 674 mev / u has been performed .",
    "based on the new data points measured up to the first diffractive minimum , the nuclear radii as well as the radial shape of the matter distribution of these helium halo nuclei have been determined , and the results are in a sound agreement with the recent systematics of these quantities given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of the new data points taken at large momentum transfer to the core radius of the @xmath0he nuclei as well as to the spin - orbital term in the gmsm calculation was demonstrated .",
    "the combined data set taken at both low and high momentum transfer were used to fine - tune the parameters of the nuclear densities of @xmath0he based on the cluster - orbital shell - model approximation @xcite .",
    "the core and halo radii obtained from the present gmsm analysis were used in a geometrical model suggested for the borromean nucleus @xmath2he @xcite to determine various size parameters of this nucleus , and the results agree with those obtained in ref .",
    "the enhancement of the @xmath49-core radius of @xmath2he compared to that of @xmath63he found in the present gmsm analysis can be qualitatively understood in that simple geometrical picture .",
