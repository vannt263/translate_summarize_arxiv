    "one of the most important task of solar physics is to understand the origin of solar energetic particles which concerns several key problems : where is the acceleration site ? what factors do dominate the acceleration process ?",
    "what signals do these particles produce ?",
    "how does the energy release ? how do these particles propagate and interact with the ambient plasmas ?",
    "solar radio type iii burst is a kind of transient event of strong emission with fast negative or positive frequency drift .",
    "the observed type iii bursts usually occur at decimeter , meter and longer wavelengths with negative frequency drifts ( e.g. , lin & hudson 1971 , kane 1981 , huang et al .",
    "2011 ) which are called normal type iii bursts .",
    "they are interpreted as caused by energetic electrons streaming through the background plasma at speed of about 0.1 - 0.9@xmath4 ( @xmath4 is the light speed ) along the open coronal magnetic field .",
    "therefore , they are believed to be the excellent tracer of energetic electron beams in the corona ( e.g. , lin & hudson 1971 , lin et al .",
    "1981 , christe et al .",
    "2008 , chen et al .",
    "2013 , reid & ratcliffe 2014 , etc . ) .",
    "sometimes , radio type iii bursts have positive frequency drifts at decimeter or shorter wavelengths , called microwave type iii bursts in previous publications ( stahli & benz 1987 , sawant et al . 1994 , mszrosov et al . 2008 ) .",
    "we call them uniformly reverse - slope ( rs ) type iii bursts .",
    "they are explained as caused by energetic electron beams propagating from the accelerated site downward to denser plasma by plasma emission(pe ) or electron cyclotron maser emission ( ecme , aschwanden & benz 1997 , bastian et al .",
    "since the rs type iii bursts are mainly occurring in decimeter and centimeter wavelengths which produced very closed to the primary energy release site of solar flares , rs type iii bursts may reveal the intrinsic properties beneath the acceleration site ( altyntsev et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "occasionally , radio type iii pairs were also observed ( huang et al .",
    "1998 , ning et al .",
    "2000 , ma et al .",
    ", 2008 , karlick 2014 ) .",
    "a type iii pair is composed of two type iii burst branches beginning almost at the same time , one is a normal type iii burst with negative frequency drift and the other is a rs type iii burst with positive frequency drift .",
    "the normal branch can track the upgoing energetic electron beam , and the rs branch can track the downward electron beam ( robinson & benz 2000 ) .",
    "the type iii pairs can be regarded as a sensitive tool to diagnose the physical conditions around the flare energy - release site where magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration takes place .",
    "for example , the separate frequency between the normal and rs branches may pinpoint the acceleration site and demarcate the electron density .",
    "the frequency gap , frequency drift , and burst lifetime may reveal the intrinsic nature of the primary energy release processes in solar flares ( aschwanden & benz 1997 , sakai et al .",
    "2005 , altyntsev et al .",
    "2007 , li et al . 2011 ) .    generally , an ideal type iii pair is just composed of a normal branch and a corresponding rs branch simultaneously ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1993 , huang et al .",
    "1998 , ning et al .",
    "2000 ) . however , the actual conditions are always complex , including irregular magnetic structures , repeatedly electron acceleration , free - free absorption , and rapid changes in the source regions ( benz et al .",
    "1992 , meshalkina et al . 2004 ) .",
    "practically and generally , observations always show a group of normal type iii bursts at low frequency band and a group of rs type iii bursts at higher frequency band occur in same time interval ( aschwanden et al .",
    "1997 , ma et al . 2008 ) .",
    "it is difficult to clarify their one - to - one corresponding relationships .",
    "we call this complex assembly a type iii pair train",
    ". it may be associated to a group of upward electron beams and a group of downward beams producing repeatedly and propagating in the background plasmas .",
    "aschwanden et al .",
    "( 1993 ) reported two radio type iii pair events with separate frequencies between the normal and rs branches at 620 and 750mhz , respectively .",
    "then they collected several type iii pairs and found that separate frequency ranges in 220 - 910mhz with average of about 500mhz ( aschwanden & benz 1997 ) .",
    "they proposed that acceleration takes place in a low - density region above a denser soft x - ray flare loop .",
    "later , huang et al . (",
    "1998 ) reported a type iii pair with separate frequency up to 1.71ghz .",
    "ma et al . ( 2008 ) found that separate frequencies scattered in a much wider range and pointed out that in different flares the acceleration regions may locate at a large range of heights .",
    "are other properties of acceleration region different from flare to flares ?    this work presents a systematic investigation of solar microwave type iii pairs including events collected in the previous literature and recently observed in two radio spectrometers located in china and the czech republic .",

    "generally , it is believed that microwave type iii pairs are signatures of bi - directional energetic electron beams which may pinpoint acceleration sites in solar flares",
    ". the magnetic reconnection may take place in a cusp configuration above and very close to the top of flaring loop similarly as the masuda - like flare ( masuda et al .",
    "1994 , etc . ) , or in the current sheet above and beyond flare loops triggered by the tearing - mode instability ( kliem et al . 2000 ,",
    "electrons are accelerated in the reconnection site , propagate upward or downward , and produce normal or rs type iii bursts .",
    "therefore , the observations of microwave type iii pairs may provide the most fundamental information of the flare energy - release region where the magnetic reconnection , particle acceleration , and the primary energy release occur .",
    "the short lifetimes and very high brightness temperatures of microwave type iii bursts indicate that the emission should be coherent processes .",
    "the first possible mechanism is electron cyclotron maser emission ( ecm , melrose & dulk 1982 , tang et al .",
    "2012 ) which requires a strong background magnetic field : @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 is electron gyro - frequency and @xmath72 is plasma frequency . as the type iii pairs here occurred at frequency of 0.9 - 4.5ghz , which requires magnetic fields @xmath73 g , generally too strong to occur in the flare energy - release site .",
    "the second possible mechanism is plasma emission ( pe , zheleznyakov & zlotnik 1975 ) which is generated from the coupling of two excited plasma waves at frequency of 2@xmath72 ( second harmonic pe ) , or the coupling of an excited plasma wave and a low - frequency electrostatic wave at frequency of about @xmath72 ( fundamental pe ) . as pe has no strong magnetic field constraints , it is much easy to be the favorite mechanism of microwave type iii bursts .    in pe mechanism ,",
    "the emission frequency can be expressed ,    @xmath74    @xmath75 is the harmonic number , @xmath76 is the fundamental pe while @xmath77 is the second harmonic pe . generally , the fundamental pe has strong circular polarization , while the second harmonic pe always has relatively weak circular polarization .",
    "because the separate frequency ( @xmath0 ) of the microwave type iii pairs is possibly related to the plasma emission near the acceleration site , here the plasma density can be estimated from equation ( 1 ) :    @xmath78    the results are listed in table 1 showing densities in range of ( 0.64 - 2.8)@xmath62 m@xmath63 in impulsive phase and ( 1.03 - 1.44)@xmath79 m@xmath63 in the postflare phase , respectively .",
    "these densities are about one order of magnitude higher than that deduced by aschwanden & benz ( 1997 ) .",
    "this fact indicates that the acceleration possibly takes place in the lower corona and upper chromosphere .",
    "the plasma emission is generated when electron beams fly off the acceleration site and propagate upward or downward in the ambient plasma .",
    "however , because of coulomb collisions between the electron beam and ambient plasma , an electron beam with velocity of @xmath80 producing a microwave burst should have lifetime @xmath15 ( benz et al .",
    "1992 ) ,    @xmath81    here , the unit of @xmath80 is m s@xmath26 . using equation ( 2 ) and",
    "( 3 ) we may explain why the burst lifetime is anti - correlated to the separate frequency of thee type iii pair events .",
    "the plasma temperature can be derived from the ratio of sxr intensity at the two energy band observed by goes after subtracting the background from solar software ( ssw , thomas et al .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the temporal relation between the type iii pairs and the temperature in the flare energy - release site .",
    "table 1 lists the temperature in each microwave type iii pair event , which is in a range of ( 1.06  1.85)@xmath60 k , much hotter than the general coronal plasma ( at the magnitude of million k ) .",
    "however , it is necessary to note that the above temperature is only related to the hot flaring loops which is possible different from the real source region of type iii pair bursts .",
    "we adopt it just as an approximation to the source regions of type iii pairs .    the frequency drift of microwave type iii bursts can be derived from equation ( 1 ) :    @xmath82    and the relative frequency drift is ,",

    "@xmath89 or @xmath90 means the density increasing or decreasing with respect to time .",
    "@xmath91 is the velocity of the electron beam",
    ".    equation ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) indicate that frequency drift is composed of two parts .",
    "the first part is related to the temporal change of plasma density ( @xmath92 ) around the flare energy - release site due to plasma flows ( such as chromospheric evaporation , reconnecting flows , and or mhd oscillations ) .",
    "the second part is related to the plasma density gradient .",
    "when the electron beams propagate in the background plasma it will trigger the langmuir waves and produce plasma emission in different frequencies at different locations .    altyntsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and meshalkina et al .",
    "( 2012 ) applied the one - dimensional scan observation at two different frequency channels , and estimated that the temporal change of plasma density contributed 4 ghz @xmath52 and 6 ghz @xmath52 to the frequency drifts in two microwave type iii bursts , respectively .",
    "however , in our work we found that most microwave type iii pairs have frequency drifts @xmath93 4 ghz @xmath52 .",
    "only 3 among the 11 events have absolute frequency drift @xmath49 4 ghz @xmath52 , see in table 1 .",
    "actually , in the framework of plasma emission mechanism the separate frequency ( @xmath0 ) reflects the plasma density in the flare energy - release site , and the temporal variation of @xmath0 may reveal the plasma density change during the microwave type iii burst pair trains .",
    "table 1 listed the temporal change of separate frequency , most of them are very slow , and even close to zero . among the 11 type iii pair events , the maximum @xmath32 is occurred in the event on 2006 december 13 which is about 10 mhz s@xmath26 , and @xmath94 s@xmath26 .",
    "then @xmath95 s@xmath26 .",
    "the observation shows that the relative frequency drift ( @xmath29 ) is from 0.3 s@xmath26 to 5.3 s@xmath26 , which is three orders bigger than that caused by the plasma density temporal variation .",
    "it seems that the plasma density temporal variation does not contribute to the formation of frequency drift in type iii pairs as much as in microwave type iii bursts reported by altyntsev et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and meshalkina et al .",
    "the plasma density gradient dominates the frequency drifts of type iii pairs .",
    "therefore , we have the relation , @xmath96 and @xmath97 . with these approximations ,",
    "the velocity can be expressed ,    @xmath98    the frequency gap ( @xmath33 ) between the normal and rs branches is seldom mentioned in previous literature .",
    "this work shows that the observed results of @xmath33 are ranging from 10mhz to 1700mhz , and different from event to events .",
    "then , what factors do dominate the frequency gap ?",
    "li et al . (",
    "2011 ) simulated the generation and propagation of type iii bursts based on the assumption of power - law model ( pl , allen 1947 ) and offset power - law model ( opl , aschwanden & benz 1995 ) , respectively .",
    "they find that frequency gaps may be very large ( @xmath99mhz ) when electron beams propagate in offset power - law plasma , and relatively small ( @xmath100mhz ) in power - law plasma .",
    "it seems that the frequency gap may be related to the distribution of plasma density .",
    "according to pe mechanism , the frequency gap means a density difference between start sites of normal and rs type iii bursts .",
    "with density scale length @xmath101 , a space length can be derived :    @xmath102    @xmath103 can be regarded as an estimation of the length of acceleration regions .",
    "the electrons are accelerated in this region and get a relatively high energy , then trigger microwave type iii bursts outside this region .",
    "it is possible that @xmath103 is only an upper limit of the acceleration region .",
    "panel ( 4 ) of fig . 5 show that frequency gap has no dependence on the separate frequency .",
    "this fact implies that the length of acceleration region is possibly irrelevant to the plasma density .",
    "it is possible that the particle acceleration mechanism is the main factor to dominate the frequency gap",
    ".    equation ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) imply that @xmath101 is a key factor for determining the electron beam velocity and the source dimension length .",
    "it depends on the plasma density gradient .",
    "the microwave type iii pairs are generated very close to the flare energy - release site where the magnetic field is an important factor .",
