    "loss and divincenzo proposed to isolate individual electrons in a quantum dot array and showed that the electron spins can in principle be initialized , coherently manipulated and read out  @xcite .",
    "while there has been continued theoretical work in this area  @xcite , the loss - divincenzo proposal has not yet been realized experimentally .",
    "we have recently begun such experiments and present here the concrete and realistic path we are taking , towards the experimental demonstration of single- and two - qubit gates and the creation of entanglement of spins in quantum dot systems .",
    "the qubit is represented by the spin of a single electron in a quantum dot defined by electrostatic gates on top of a gaas@xmath1al@xmath2ga@xmath3as heterostructure .",
    "the spin ground state @xmath4 and excited state @xmath5 are separated in energy by the zeeman splitting @xmath6 , with @xmath7 the dimensionless @xmath8-factor in the dot , @xmath9 the bohr magneton and @xmath10 the static magnetic field strength .",
    "taking @xmath11 , the bulk value in gaas ( we neglect the sign ) , we have @xmath12ev per tesla in @xmath10 .    for comparison , the charging energy of a dot , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the total capacitance of the dot , is typically a few mev , much larger than the zeeman energy .",
    "the discrete energy level spacing is about a mev in small dots , also larger than @xmath15  @xcite . in",
    "what follows , we will assume that the electron always remains in the orbital ground state .",
    "although it may not be strictly necessary to work with few - electron dots , operation with one electron in each dot makes the experiment much more transparent .",
    "following other groups  @xcite , we have recently realized lateral , split - gate quantum dots with a controllable number of electrons down to @xmath16 electrons  @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of initialization is to place the qubit in a pure ( i.e. well - known ) state , say @xmath4 , as this is the desired initial state for most quantum algorithms  @xcite .",
    "the additional ability to initialize the qubit to @xmath5 , or alternatively to a mixed state where the spin is probabilistically in @xmath4 or @xmath5 , would be very useful for testing whether the read - out schemes of section  [ sec : readout ] can distinguish @xmath4 from @xmath5 .",
    "we first present two methods for initialization to the pure state @xmath4 , and then discuss a variant for initialization to a mixed state .",
    "initialization to the ground state occurs naturally when we allow the electron spin to reach thermal equilibrium at high @xmath10 and low temperature @xmath17 .",
    "pr[@xmath4 ] , given by the boltzman factor , is over @xmath19 when g_d _ b b_0 > 5 k_b t , [ eq : polarization ] with @xmath20 boltzman s constant .",
    "this condition is easily satisfied at , e.g. , 5 tesla and 300 mk ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "thermal equilibration on the dot is a very simple and robust initialiation approach , which can be used for any @xmath10 orientation and does nt require spin - polarized leads .",
    "it takes about @xmath22 to reach equilibrium , which may be on the order of 1 ms ( @xmath23 is the spin relaxation time ) .",
    "alternatively , we can let an electron tunnel to an empty dot from @xmath24-polarized leads .",
    "this gives a qubit initialized to @xmath4 , as long as the spin is conserved during tunneling , which is plausible based on transport measurements in two - dimensional electron gases ( 2degs )  @xcite .",
    "highly polarized leads can be obtained in the quantum hall regime with filling factor @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : init_leads ] a ) .",
    "only the lowest spin - split landau level is then occupied , provided @xmath26 , analogous to eq .  [ eq : polarization ] ( @xmath27 is the @xmath8-factor in the leads ) .",
    "in fact , magnetotransport measurements in 2degs with odd @xmath28 have shown that for an electron in the leads to go from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , it must overcome not only the single - particle zeeman energy but also the many - body exchange energy between the electrons in the leads  @xcite .",
    "we can describe this situation via an effective @xmath8-factor @xmath29 , which can be as large as ten times @xmath27 .",

    "the probabilities for @xmath24 and @xmath32 electrons to tunnel to the dot depend on the spin - polarization in the leads , on the fermi level in the leads @xmath35 relative to the @xmath4 and @xmath5 levels in the dot and on the distance between the dot and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 edge states in the leads  @xcite ( fig .",

    "the ideal read - out scheme offers high - fidelity , single - shot , strong quantum measurements  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the measurement must be switched off completely during the computation stage in order to avoid rapid decoherence .",
    "furthermore , the measurement time must be shorter than @xmath23 .",
    "finally , the distinction between the @xmath4 and @xmath5 states must be very sharp .",
    "the magnetic moment of a single electron spin is so weak that it has never been detected directly .",
    "previous measurements of single electron spins were based on optical techniques  @xcite .",
    "also , various proposals exist for conversion of spin information to electrical charge  @xcite or current  @xcite , both of which can be measured with high sensitivity . here",
    ", we propose to use spin - to - charge conversion : the electron on the dot quickly leaves the dot if it is , say , in @xmath4 , whereas it stays on the dot if it is in @xmath5 .",
    "next , the number of charges on the dot is measured .",
    "if there still is one electron charge on the dot , we know the qubit was in @xmath5 , and if there is no charge left , the qubit was in @xmath4 .",
    "spin - selective tunneling could in principle be realized using tunnel barriers made from magnetic materials  @xcite .",
    "however , such materials can not yet be integrated with gaas / al@xmath2ga@xmath3as heterostructures .",
    "therefore , we propose instead to operate with spin - polarized leads ( quantum hall regime with @xmath33 ) , which provide a reference spin orientation against which the qubit spin orientation can be compared .    in order to motivate our proposed scheme ,",
    "let us start with some approaches which will _ not _ work .",
    "first , if both the @xmath4 and @xmath5 levels in the dot lie below @xmath35 , the electron can never escape from the dot .",
    "second , if @xmath35 lies above the @xmath4 but below the @xmath5 dot level , the qubit electron can only tunnel out if it is in @xmath5 ; however , as soon as the qubit electron leaves the dot , another electron will enter the dot and occupy @xmath4 , so we always end up with one electron charge on the dot and no information about the spin state .",
    "third , if @xmath35 lies below the @xmath4 and @xmath5 levels of the dot and @xmath36 , the tunnel process out of the dot is not spin - selective .    however , if @xmath37 , the tunnel process _ is _ spin - selective ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_to_charge ] ) .",
    "we recall from section  [ sec : initialization ] that in @xmath33 leads , the exchange interaction increases the total energy of @xmath32 electrons with respect to @xmath24 electrons and thus suppresses the @xmath32 probability .",
    "similarly , we expect that the increased energy of the @xmath5 level in the leads reduces the probability that a @xmath32 electron will tunnel to the leads from the quantum dot , while @xmath24 electrons can tunnel to the leads easily .",
    ", the dot - lead tunnel rate can be significantly lower for @xmath5 electrons than for @xmath4 electrons , because of the difference in tunnel distances .",
    "( b ) when @xmath38 , the @xmath5 states in the leads are unreachable energetically for an electron in the dot.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ] , the dot - lead tunnel rate can be significantly lower for @xmath5 electrons than for @xmath4 electrons , because of the difference in tunnel distances .",
    "( b ) when @xmath38 , the @xmath5 states in the leads are unreachable energetically for an electron in the dot.,title=\"fig:\",width=188 ]    an alternative spin - selective tunneling process , inspired by  @xcite , consists of allowing a second electron to tunnel onto the dot from @xmath33 leads .",
    "this @xmath24 electron will form a singlet state with the qubit electron if the qubit spin was in @xmath5 , whereas they will form a triplet if the qubit was in @xmath4 .",
    "since the singlet and triplet energies can be made very different  @xcite , the second electron will or will not enter the dot depending on the qubit state . as before , subsequent single - shot measurement of the charge on the dot will reveal the qubit state .",
    "we expect both read - out schemes to be very robust : @xmath39 is as much as 1 mev ( 11 kelvin ) for @xmath40 t and @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the singlet - triplet energy difference can also be of order a mev  @xcite .",
    "read - out schemes based on the zeeman splitting ( @xmath42 mev ) are likely less reliable .",
    "+ measurement of the number of electron charges on the dot must be completed in a time @xmath43 short compared to @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , if the electron is supposed to tunnel , it should do so in a time @xmath44 short compared to @xmath43 .",
    "if the electron is not supposed to tunnel , it should not do so for a time @xmath45 long compared to @xmath43 . in summary , we need @xmath46 . taking @xmath47s  @xcite and @xmath48s ,",
    "we must measure the charge in a time @xmath43 of @xmath49s .",
    "a variety of highly sensitive charge meters exist , such as single - electron transistors ( sets ) , rf - sets and quantum point contacts ( qpcs )  @xcite .",
    "we have opted to use a qpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sem_images ] ) , since it is easy to fabricate and integrate with lateral quantum dots , and because we expect its charge sensitivity to be sufficient to determine the number of electron charges on the dot within 1 - 10 @xmath50s ( using a low temperature follower stage with output impedance of a few k@xmath51 ) .    finally , we point out that the qubit measurement can be switched off by going to the coulomb blockade regime with the number of electrons on the dot fixed to one . at this point ,",
    "charge read - out contains no information about the spin state , and does not cause back - action on the qubit . the qubit measurement is switched on by setting the dot potential so that spin - selective tunneling becomes possible , and spin information is converted into charge information .",
    "a microwave magnetic field @xmath52 oscillating in the plane @xmath53 to @xmath0 at a frequency @xmath54 , in resonance with the spin precession about @xmath0 , will cause the spin to make transitions between @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "evidently , if @xmath55 , the spins in the leads would also be on resonance , and the spin polarization in the leads would disappear .",
    "fortunately , @xmath8 varies with @xmath10 , @xmath56 and the geometry of the structure  @xcite , thus we expect @xmath57 .",
    "the choice of @xmath10 strength is a trade - off between reliable initialization and read - out ( strong @xmath10 is better ) and experimental convenience ( low @xmath58 is easier ) .",
    "a field of 5 tesla seems reasonable : with @xmath21 , high - fidelity initialization and read - out should be within reach ( sections  [ sec : initialization ] and  [ sec : readout ] ) , and @xmath59 ghz .",
    "properly timed bursts of microwave power tip the spin state over a controlled angle , e.g. @xmath60 or @xmath61 . in order to observe rabi oscillations ,",
    "the rabi period must be at most of the order of the phase randomization time constant @xmath62 .",
    "the @xmath62 of a single electron spin in a quantum dot has never been measured , but based on experiments with electrons in 2deg s , we expect that @xmath62 may be @xmath63 ns  @xcite . for a rabi period of 150 ns ( @xmath64 mhz ) ,",
    "we need a microwave field strength @xmath65 of @xmath66 mt . for single - qubit rotations much faster than @xmath62",
    ", a much stronger @xmath65 is needed .    in order to just observe electron spin resonance ( esr ) , however , @xmath65 can be much smaller .",
    "steady - state solution of the bloch equations with a continuous wave ( cw ) microwave field @xmath65 applied on - resonance with the spin transition , gives pr@xmath67 = [ 1 + 1/(1+(2\\pi f_1)^2 t_1 t_2)]/2 $ ]  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to disturb pr@xmath67 $ ] an observable amount away from @xmath68 , we need @xmath69 .",
    "taking @xmath70s and @xmath71 ns , we need @xmath72 khz , and thus @xmath73 mt , one hundred times less than needed to observe rabi oscillations .",
    "+ excitation of esr microwave magnetic fields commonly relies on microwave cavities , but unfortunately , a lot of power is dissipated in metallic cavities : over 1 watt for @xmath74 mt at @xmath75 ghz and still about 100 @xmath50w for @xmath76mt  @xcite .",
    "superconducting cavities are not an option since @xmath10 is too large .",
    "the alternative we pursue is to send an alternating current through a wire running close by the dot .",
    "the wire can be seen as a lumped element if it is much shorter than the wavelength , which is a few mm at 30 ghz near the surface of a gaas substrate .",
    "if the wire terminates a @xmath77 transmission line and has an impedance @xmath78 , it represents a shorted termination and the current is maximum at the wire ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wire ] a ) .",
    "if the wire is placed well within one wavelength @xmath79 from the quantum dot , the dot is in the near - field region and the electric and magnetic field distribution produced by the ac current is the same as for a dc current  @xcite . at a distance @xmath80 from the center of the wire , a current @xmath81 through a wire with circular cross - section thus produces a magnetic field @xmath82 , and no electric field . if the wire is located off - chip ,",
    "say , @xmath83 m away from the dot , and @xmath50 equals the magnetic susceptibility in vacuum @xmath84 , we need a current of about 1 a to produce a 1 mt microwave field , and 10 ma to get 0.01 mt .",
    "a wire integrated on - chip could be placed much closer to the dot , say 200 nm away , so the current needed is only @xmath66 ma or 10 @xmath50a respectively .",
    "energy dissipation by high frequency currents in transmission lines takes place through ohmic , dielectric and radiation losses  @xcite . for the on - chip section of the transmission line ( a coplanar waveguide or coplanar striplines ) and for the wire termination",
    ", radiation losses can be kept low by placing the sample inside a cavity with lowest resonance frequency above the operating frequency ( longest dimension below 5 mm ) . at 30 ghz ,",
    "dielectric losses are typically of the same order as ohmic losses , but in the on - chip section , the wire cross - section is so small that ohmic losses dominate .",
    "the off - chip section of the transmission line is a semirigid coaxial connection , which has relatively low loss and is thermally anchored to the higher temperature stages of the cryostat .",
    "the ohmic losses in the on - chip lines thus dominate ; we estimate them to be of order 10 @xmath50w for @xmath85 ma . even considering additional power dissipation due to dielectric and other losses ,",
    "the total dissipated power should be well below the thermal budget at the mixing chamber of a dilution refrigerator ( a few 100 @xmath50w at 100 mk ) , especially if the duty cycle is kept low .",
    "nevertheless , local and instantaneous heating of the device is still a concern so we will keep losses down by maximizing the cross - section of the metal lines , by minimizing @xmath86 , and by constructing a good heat - link from the chip to the mixing chamber .    for @xmath87 to the surface ( needed for operation in the quantum hall regime )",
    ", @xmath52 must run through the dot in a direction parallel to the surface , so we must place the wire above the dot , and not to its side .",
    "it can be located on top of an insulating dielectric layer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : wire ] b ) .",
    "finally , individual addressing of one among several qubits could be achieved , in principle , via local gate electrodes , which push the individual electron wavefunctions towards a semiconductor layer with a different composition and hence a different @xmath8-factor ( in al@xmath2ga@xmath3as , @xmath8 changes from @xmath88 to @xmath89 when @xmath90 varies from 0 to 1 ) . in this way",
    ", the electrons can be shifted into or away from resonance with the applied microwave field as desired  @xcite .",
    "two electron spins @xmath92 and @xmath93 in neighbouring quantum dots are coupled to each other by the exchange interaction , which takes the form @xmath94 .",
    "the result of this interaction is that the states of the two spins are swapped after a certain time .",
    "an interaction active for half this time performs the @xmath91 gate , which has been shown to be universal for quantum computation when combined with single qubit rotations  @xcite . in fact , the exchange interaction is even universal by itself when the state of each qubit is encoded in the state of three electron spins  @xcite .",
    "the strength @xmath95 of the exchange interaction depends on the overlap of the respective electron wavefunctions , which varies exponentially with the voltage applied to the gate controlling the tunnel barrier between the two dots . for very small dots with interdot distance of a few tens of nm",
    ", @xmath96 may be as large as 100 ghz  @xcite . for current sizes of dots and an interdot distance of @xmath97 nm",
    ", @xmath96 may still correspond to a frequency of a few tens of ghz , so two - qubit gates could be performed in @xmath98 ps .",
    "we can explore the operation of the swap gate as soon as initialization and read - out are reliable , without requiring esr  @xcite .",
    "imagine qubit 1 is prepared in a pure state @xmath4 and qubit 2 is prepared in a statistical mixture of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "measurement of qubit 1 should then always give @xmath4 while measurement of qubit 2 should give probabilistically @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "after application of the swap gate , in contrast , measurement of qubit 2 should always give @xmath4 , while measurement of qubit 1 should give a probabilistic outcome .",
    "in summary , we have presented a procedure for initialization with tunable spin - polarization , for reliable single - shot spin - to - charge conversion and charge measurement , for electron spin resonance with a microfabricated wire and for two - qubit gates using the exchange interaction .",
    "all these schemes can be realized with current technology and we have begun experiments using the devices shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sem_images ] .",
    "the estimated quantum gate duration achievable at present is a few tens of ns .",
    "this requires @xmath99s in order to reach error probabilities per operation below @xmath100 , needed for fault - tolerant quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "speeding up single - spin rotations requires much stronger microwave fields , which probably means that alternative ways for excitation must be found which dissipate less power than cavities or wires .",
    "the long term promise of electron spin qubits in gaas / algaas quantum dots clearly depends crucially on the coherence times @xmath62 and @xmath23 .",
    "theoretical studies of decoherence of electron spins in quantum dots have focussed mostly on energy exchange with the bath , i.e. @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "the decay time for an electron in an excited orbital state to the ground orbital state has been measured to exceed 200 @xmath50s when a spin flip was involved in the transition  @xcite , so this gives hope that the @xmath23 ( spin relaxation time for an electron in the zeeman split orbital ground state ) may also be @xmath101s .",
