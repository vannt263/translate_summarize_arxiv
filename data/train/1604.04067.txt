    "<S> based on a stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations in the boundary region of magnetically confined plasmas , an expression for the level crossing rate is derived from the joint distribution of the process and its derivative . from this the average time spent by the process above a certain threshold level </S>",
    "<S> is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> this provides novel predictions of plasma  wall interactions due to transient transport events associated with radial motion of blob - like structures in the scrape - off layer .    </S>",
    "<S> plasma  wall interactions remain an outstanding challenge in the quest for controlled thermonuclear fusion based on magnetic confinement . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite transient transport events due to filamentary structures moving through the scrape - off layer may cause detrimental sputtering and erosion of the main chamber walls . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between the hot plasma and material surfaces depends on the turbulence - induced particle and heat fluxes , so gaining insight into the statistical properties of plasma fluctuations in the boundary region is of considerable interest .    the radial propagation of blob - like structures results in large - amplitude bursts in single - point measurements in the scrape - off layer . </S>",
    "<S> recent analysis of such measurement time series using conditional averaging have elucidated the statistical properties of large - amplitude fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the experimental results provide evidence that plasma fluctuations can be described as a super - position of uncorrelated pulses with fixed , exponential pulse shape of constant duration and exponentially distributed pulse amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> these are the basic assumptions behind a recently suggested stochastic model for intermittent plasma fluctuations in the scrape - off layer region . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this model describes many experimental findings from the boundary region of magnetized plasmas , including bursty fluctuations , skewed and flattened probability density functions and accordingly a parabolic relation between the skewness and flatness moments for a broad range of parameters.@xcite    based on this stochastic model , the joint distribution function of the process and its derivative is derived . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown to give novel predictions of the intermittent features of plasma fluctuations , in particular the rate of level crossings and excess time statistics , that is , the duration of time intervals where the signal exceeds some prescribed threshold level . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite although of particular interest for plasma  wall interactions in fusion grade plasmas , the stochastic model is prototypical for many intermittent systems , and the results find applications in a broad range of fields ( see for example ref .   and references therein ) .    </S>",
    "<S> given the joint probability density function @xmath0 for a stationary random variable @xmath1 and its derivative @xmath2 , the number of up - crossings of the level @xmath3 in a time interval of duration @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath5 for independent , normally distributed @xmath6 and @xmath7 , this gives the celebrated result known as the rice formula , @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the mean value of @xmath6 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the root mean square ( rms ) values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of level crossings is clearly largest for threshold values close to the mean value of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the average time @xmath12 spent above a threshold value @xmath3 by the stationary process is given by the ratio of the total time spent above the level @xmath6 and the number of up - crossings @xmath13 in an interval of duration @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the former is by definition given by the complementary cumulative distribution function @xmath14 for the process , where @xmath15 is the cumulative distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> this gives the average excess time as @xmath16 for independent , normally distributed @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the average excess time is given by @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the complementary error function . </S>",
    "<S> this normal limit has previously been compared with measurement data from a basic laboratory experiment and rocket data from the polar ionosphere , and the discrepancy interpreted as a signature of intermittency in the underlying processes . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    the goal of this contribution is to generalize the above expressions for level crossings and excess times for a stochastic process that describes intermittent fluctuations in the boundary region of magnetically confined plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> the plasma fluctuations are in this case described as a super - position of uncorrelated pulses , @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pulse arrival time for event @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the pulse amplitude and the pulse shape @xmath23 is assumed to be the same for all events . in eq .   </S>",
    "<S> the sum is over exactly @xmath24 pulses present in a record of duration @xmath4 , and the pulse arrival times are assumed to have a uniform distribution . from this </S>",
    "<S> it follows that the number of pulses @xmath25 is poisson distributed with constant rate @xmath26 , @xmath27 thus , the waiting time between pulses are exponentially distributed with mean value @xmath28 .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> the pulse shapes are described by a double - exponential function @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the pulse duration and @xmath31 is a pulse shape asymmetry parameter restricted to the range @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio between the pulse duration and average waiting time , @xmath33 determines the degree of pulse overlap and is the most fundamental parameter of the stochastic model .    </S>",
    "<S> given exponentially distributed pulse amplitudes with mean value @xmath34 , the stationary distribution of the random variable @xmath35 can be shown to be gamma distributed with shape parameter @xmath36 and scale parameter @xmath34 ; @xcite @xmath37 the mean of the random variable @xmath6 is @xmath38 and the variance is @xmath39 , giving the relative fluctuation level @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the skewness of @xmath6 is @xmath41 and the flatness is @xmath42 , giving a parabolic relation between skewness and flatness : @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> this parabolic relation is a very good description of experimental data from the scrape - off layer.@xcite it can be shown that the distribution of the normalized process @xmath44 resembles a normal distribution in the limit @xmath45 , independent of pulse shape and amplitude distribution . in this case , both the skewness @xmath46 and the excess kurtosis @xmath47 vanish.@xcite    note that in the case of positive definite amplitudes and the pulse shape in eq .  , @xmath6 is non - negative , giving @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , a normally distributed random variable has infinite support . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the probability density function of @xmath49 and a standard normal distribution ( the distribution of a normally distributed variable with zero mean and unit standard deviation ) due to this discrepancy is negligible , however , since values of @xmath50 or less are highly unlikely for a standard normal distribution in the case of @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> realizations of this process for various values of @xmath52 are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : realizations ] . for small @xmath52 , </S>",
    "<S> the pulses are well separated and the process is strongly intermittent . for large @xmath52 , there is significant pulse overlap and realizations of the process resembles random noise , with relatively small and symmetric fluctuations around the mean value . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath52 can therefore be interpreted as an intermittency parameter for the process .    in order to calculate the joint distribution of the process and its derivative , the normalized time derivative </S>",
    "<S> is defined by @xmath53 where the pulse shape is given by @xmath54 this is another stochastic process of the same type as given in eq .  , but with a different pulse shape . </S>",
    "<S> since the process @xmath1 is stationary , it follows that @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the processes @xmath1 and @xmath56 are evidently dependent yet also uncorrelated , @xmath57 the lowest order moments of @xmath58 are readily calculated as @xmath59 , @xmath60^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath61/\\gamma$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> like before , it is possible to show that the probability density function of @xmath58 resembles a normal distribution in the limit @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> using that individual events are uncorrelated and that the number of pulses is poisson distributed , the joint probability density function of @xmath6 and @xmath58 can be calculated as @xmath62 where @xmath63   \\right )    \\label{jpdf - charfun - start}\\ ] ] is the joint characteristic function between @xmath6 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this expression is given in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> for the case of fixed ( degenerately distributed ) pulse amplitudes , although the generalization is straightforward . for the process described here , a lengthy calculation gives @xmath64^{-\\gamma \\lambda } \\left [ 1- i { \\left < a \\right>}\\left ( u-\\frac{v}{1-\\lambda } \\right ) \\right]^{-\\gamma\\left ( 1-\\lambda \\right)}.    \\label{jpdf - charfun}\\ ] ] substituted into eq .  , the stationary joint probability density function can be obtained in closed form . </S>",
    "<S> this is non - zero only for the limited range @xmath65 , and given by @xmath66^{\\gamma \\lambda -1 } \\left ( { \\phi}-\\lambda { \\theta}\\right)^{\\gamma ( 1-\\lambda ) -1}.\\ ] ] this limited range of the non - zero joint probability follows from the fact that the signal @xmath1 can not decrease faster than the rate of decay of individual pulse structures , nor increase slower than the rate of growth of individual pulses .    as the probability density function of both @xmath6 and @xmath58 resembles a normal distribution in the limit @xmath45 and they are uncorrelated , the joint probability density function for @xmath6 and @xmath58 resembles the product of two normal distributions , that is , a joint normal distribution with vanishing correlation coefficient </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the normal limit @xmath67 , the classical rice formula given by eq .   </S>",
    "<S> discussed above is recovered . as in the case of @xmath68 , there is a discrepancy between @xmath69 and a joint normal distribution due to the limited region of non - zero values of @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> the domain of non - zero values can be written as @xmath70 where @xmath71 . for standard </S>",
    "<S> normally distributed variables , values outside of this domain are highly unlikely in the case of @xmath51 , and this discrepancy is in practice negligible .    the joint distribution @xmath72 is presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jpdf - g1 ] and  [ fig : jpdf - g10 ] for @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that logarithmic scaling is used in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jpdf - g1 ] while linear scaling is used in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : jpdf - g10 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the white area in both figures are the regions where @xmath69 vanishes , as given by eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> the joint distribution for @xmath75 diverges at @xmath76 and @xmath77 , since the pulses arrive rarely enough for the signal to fall close to zero for long time durations . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the signal is very likely to decay undisturbed at the rate of individual pulses , explaining the increased value of the joint distribution near the line @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> the joint distribution for @xmath79 is unimodal , since significant pulse overlap causes a wider range of values for @xmath58 to be likely for a given value of @xmath6 .    </S>",
    "<S> the rate of up - crossings above a threshold @xmath6 is now readily calculated from eq .   as @xmath80 which , together with the complementary cumulative distribution function of the gamma distributed variable @xmath6 , @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the regularized upper gamma function , gives the average time above the threshold @xmath83 note that both eqs .   and can be written as a pre factor depending on @xmath52 and @xmath31 multiplied by a function of @xmath52 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the functional shape of both equations with threshold level depends only on the intermittency parameter @xmath52 while the total value of the functions depends on both @xmath52 and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the complementary cumulative distribution function eq .   does not depend on @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> thus we only present @xmath85 , @xmath14 and @xmath86 for fixed @xmath31 and various values of @xmath52 in the following .    the complementary cumulative distribution function as a function of the threshold level for various values of @xmath52 </S>",
    "<S> is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ccdfsn ] . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath52 increases , this function approaches that of a normal distribution and , in the normal regime @xmath51 , the fraction of time above threshold falls rapidly with increasing threshold level since the fluctuations in the signal are concentrated around the mean value . in the strong intermittency regime , @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> the signal spends long periods of time close to zero value as few pulses overlap . </S>",
    "<S> thus the total time above threshold increases rapidly as the threshold approaches zero .    the rate of up - crossings as function of the threshold level for various values of @xmath52 is presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ex - x ] . </S>",
    "<S> the number of crossings is evidently proportional to the length of the time series @xmath4 and inversely proportional to the pulse duration @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of threshold crossings is highest for thresholds close to the mean value of the process in all cases . in the non - intermittent regime @xmath88 , there are few crossings for threshold levels much smaller or much larger than the mean value due to the low probability of large - amplitude fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of level crossings is therefore a narrow normal distribution in this limit . in the strong intermittency regime , @xmath89 , </S>",
    "<S> the signal spends most of the time close to zero value , and virtually any pulse arrival will give rise to a level crossing for finite threshold values . as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : ex - x ] , the rate of level crossings approaches a step function in this limit .    </S>",
    "<S> the average time above threshold is presented in fig .  [ fig : ex - avt ] for various values of @xmath52 . while both the rate of threshold crossings and the fraction of time above threshold vary qualitatively as @xmath52 changes </S>",
    "<S> , the shape of the average time above threshold is fairly similar . in all cases the average excess time decreases monotonically with the threshold level , with a fast drop for small threshold values </S>",
    "<S> this is followed by a slow tapering off for large threshold values . for the range of intermittency parameters considered here , </S>",
    "<S> the average excess time is of the order of the pulse duration or shorter for large threshold values . </S>",
    "<S> the average time above threshold decreases by about half a decade for each tenfold increase in @xmath52 , but the functional shape varies little . indeed , it can be shown that for given @xmath52 and @xmath31 , @xmath90 scales as @xmath91 in the limit @xmath92 . as the threshold value increases above the mean signal value , up - crossings of the threshold become fewer while the signal spends less time in total above the threshold . evidently these two effects nearly cancel , and the average excess time decreases slowly with increasing threshold level .    </S>",
    "<S> considering comparisons to experimental data , the results presented here provide two major improvements over the classical rice s formula in the case of intermittent fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , any discrepancy between the normal limit for excess time statistics and measurement data has previously been interpreted as a signature of intermittency in the process . </S>",
    "<S> the formulas derived here quantifies the level of intermittency by the model parameters @xmath31 and @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , rice s formula requires the rms - value of the derivative of the signal , which is difficult if not impossible to estimate for discretely sampled data . in contrast , estimates for @xmath31 and @xmath52 can be found from the signal using the lowest order moments of @xmath6 and its correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    in conclusion , a previously suggested stochastic model for intermittent fluctuations in the scrape - off layer of magnetically confined plasmas has been considered . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of a super - position of pulses with a fixed , exponential pulse shape and exponentially distributed amplitudes arriving according to a poisson process . in this contribution , the joint probability density function of the random variable and its derivative is derived and is used to obtain predictions for level crossings and average excess times for fluctuations above a given threshold . </S>",
    "<S> these predictions depend on two model parameters , the intermittency parameter @xmath52 and the pulse shape asymmetry parameter @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the functional shape of the rate of level crossings with the threshold level is strongly dependent on the intermittency parameter @xmath52 of the process , while the functional shape of the average excess time varies little with the parameter @xmath52 , suggesting that the rate of level crossings might be a more useful tool in comparing the model to experimental data in order to assess intermittency effects . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> the functional shape does not depend on @xmath31 .    </S>",
    "<S> even though the total time above a given threshold level may be the same for realizations of two different intermittent processes , this can be realized through either many short plasma bursts or few but long lasting bursts events . </S>",
    "<S> this may have profound implications for plasma - wall interactions in magnetically confined plasmas , since long lasting , large amplitude events can lead to severe damaging while the system can recover from the damaging impacts of shorter burst events depending on their frequency of occurrence.@xcite thus accurately predicting the rate of level crossings and average excess times for an intermittent process is of considerable interest to statistical modelling of fluctuations in the boundary region of magnetically confined plasmas . </S>",
    "<S> in future work , the novel predictions presented here will be compared to experimental measurement data from the scrape - off layer of magnetically confined plasmas . </S>"
