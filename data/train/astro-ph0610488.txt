    "the most massive black holes in the universe reside in the centers of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the @xmath8 ( macchetto et al . 1997 ) behemoth in m87 in the virgo cluster is one of the nearest ( @xmath9  mpc , tonry et al .",
    "2001 , for which 1=78  pc ) .",
    "such black holes are thought to have accumulated most of their mass by accretion of gas from thin disks , which efficiently radiate about 10% of the rest mass energy of the gas .",
    "these systems are likely to power the luminous quasars that are common at high redshifts .",
    "most black holes we observe today in the local universe are not surrounded by very luminous accretion disks .",
    "this is surprising because these black holes are often embedded in gas that should be able to accrete . in the centers of elliptical galaxies",
    "the gas is typically at temperatures of @xmath10  kev , i.e. @xmath11  k , corresponding to sound speeds of 400  @xmath7 , and at particle densities of about @xmath12 .",
    "these properties can be measured relatively accurately with high - spatial - resolution x - ray telescopes .",
    "for example the chandra x - ray observatory measures @xmath13  kev and @xmath14 in the central kpc of m87 ( di  matteo et al .",
    ". the expected bondi accretion rate to the black hole is given approximately by the product of the gas density , sound speed , and area of a sphere with a radius such that the escape speed at this distance is the sound speed .",
    "for m87 the expected accretion rate is about @xmath15 and the luminosity of a thin accretion disk would then be @xmath16 ( tan & blackman 2005 , hereafter tb05 ) .",
    "however , the radiative luminosity of the nucleus is observed to be only @xmath17 ( biretta , stern & harris 1991 ) .",
    "it is possible that the radiative luminosity is only a fraction of the total accretion luminosity since accretion likely powers the observed m87 jet .",
    "the mechanical luminosity of the observed m87 jet has been estimated to be as large as @xmath18 ( reynolds et al .",
    "1996 ) by assuming a minimum pressure in the 5  kpc radio lobes to obtain the total energy , in combination with synchrotron spectral aging to obtain a lifetime of @xmath19 years .",
    "these estimates are sensitive to any uncertainties in the aging .",
    "also , it is not certain that the m87 outflow luminosity has been steady from the beginning of the radio lobe formation to the present .",
    "nevertheless , if the jet luminosity were steady and the above estimate correct , then the discrepancy between a model involving the extraction of 10% of the rest mass energy of an accretion flow equal to the present bondi accretion rate and the total output from accretion ( radiative + mechanical ) would still be a factor of 10 .    to help explain these discrepancies , models of radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) have been proposed . in the simplest variant , the cooling time of the gas",
    "is long compared to the accretion time , so much of the energy is advected into the black hole ( ichimaru 1977 ; narayan & yi 1995 ; quataert & gruzinov 1999 ) . in other variants ,",
    "the inability of the gas to cool leads to reduced accretion rates near the black hole due to the generation of outflows ( blandford & begelman 1999 ) or convective motions ( quataert & gruzinov 2000 ) .",
    "a qualitatively different model allows the gas to cool to form a thin disk , but prevents accretion of the gas by having it form stars ( tb05 ) .",
    "these stars are then on relatively dissipationless orbits about the black hole .",
    "a prediction of this model is the presence of a star - forming disk inside the bondi radius of the black hole .",
    "since all known star formation in the universe occurs in cold , molecular gas , that is best traced by the rotational transitions of carbon monoxide ( co ) , this model predicts that co emission should be seen from such a circumnuclear disk .    in the case of m87",
    ", tb05 predicted a molecular gas mass of about @xmath20 , assuming the disk is self - regulated to have a toomre @xmath21 parameter of unity by the energy input from star formation at a rate equal to the bondi accretion rate .",
    "this star formation rate is consistent with the observed h@xmath22 luminosity of the nuclear disk , although it is possible that the agn also contributes significantly to the ionization of this gas .",
    "the quoted variation in this estimate is due to whether the disk is optically thick or thin to the heating radiation from the stars .",
    "additional systematic uncertainties at the factor of a few level are caused by uncertainties in the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) , radial distribution of the gas and star formation , and the black hole mass .",
    "the deep potential well of the m87 black hole causes large orbital speeds in the disk .",
    "given the above mass estimate , these are equal to @xmath23 at a distance of 100  pc , about the extent of the observed h@xmath22 ( ford et al .",
    "1994 ) and disk ( macchetto et al .",
    "from the latter study , the best fit value of the inclination angle of the disk s rotation axis to our line of sight is @xmath24 , the systemic velocity is 1290  @xmath25 , and the observed fwhm along a slit running through the center of the disk and 1  in extent is about 700  @xmath25 .",
    "if co emission emerges from the same region , then one expects a similarly broad line , which presents a problem for its detection since most radio telescopes have relatively narrow band passes .",
    "the submillimeter array ( sma , ho , moran , & lo 2004 ) has a large band pass of about 2  ghz , corresponding to 2600  @xmath25 at the frequency of co(j=21 ) line emission ( i.e. 230  ghz , 1.3 mm ) .",
    "having significant line - free regions in the bandpass is important for determining the continuum level , since the immediate vicinity of the black hole is known to be a strong ( @xmath261.5  jy ) radio continuum source at @xmath27=1 mm . for these reasons",
    ", we used the sma to perform a search for molecular gas in the nuclear disk of m87 .",
    "braine & wiklind ( 1993 ) searched for co in m87 with the iram 30 m single - dish telescope , with a beam size of 13(=1.0  kpc ) for the co(2 - 1 ) search at 230  ghz and 21(=1.6  kpc ) for the co(1 - 0 ) search at 115  ghz .",
    "thus these observations did not resolve the @xmath28 circumnuclear disk .",
    "another limitation was the relatively narrow bandpass , corresponding to @xmath29 for co(2 - 1 ) and @xmath30 for co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "braine & wiklind ( 1993 ) derived an upper limit to the molecular gas mass of @xmath31 from their co(21 ) data ( based on a @xmath3 uncertainty of @xmath32 over the assumed 500  @xmath25 line width , a j=2 - 1 to j=1 - 0 line ratio of unity , a standard co to @xmath33 conversion factor of @xmath34 for optically thick emission at temperatures @xmath35  k , and a geometric area of @xmath36 ) and a limit of @xmath37 from their co(1 - 0 ) data .",
    "the limit from co(21 ) is not valid for a line that is broader than about @xmath38 .",
    "braine & wiklind ( 1993 ) also derived more stringent limits assuming optically thin co emission , although this would require @xmath39 for typical molecular cloud conditions , which would not be expected if the gas was organized into self - gravitating molecular clouds , as in the model of tb05 .",
    "combes , young & bureau ( 2007 ) also searched for co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) emission from the central region of m87 with the iram  30 m single - dish telescope . from the lack of detected co(1 - 0 ) emission in their 23(1.8  kpc ) fwhm beam and 1300  @xmath7 bandpass , they estimate a @xmath3 upper limit of @xmath40 of molecular gas ( assuming @xmath41 , a 300  @xmath7 line width , and a geometric area of @xmath42 ) . using similar observations of co(1 - 0 ) with the iram 30 m telescope , salom & combes ( 2008 ) reported an upper mass limit of @xmath43 ( @xmath44 corrected to our adopted distance of 16  mpc ) evaluated assuming a 300  @xmath7 line width .",

    "we conclude that if the observed 100  pc scale circumnuclear disk in m87 contains a gas mass of @xmath116 , allowing gravitational instabilities to form over - dense clouds ( tb05 ) , then the present nuclear x - ray fluxes are small enough to allow formation of molecular clouds of similar co content and temperature to giant molecular clouds seen in the milky way .",
    "as disk material approaches the black hole , the increasing x - ray flux will eventually cause the gas to transition to a fully atomic state .",
    "radiative pumping of lower excitation co rotational states may also be important in affecting the observed intensity of co(j=21 ) emission ( maloney , begelman , & rees 1994 ) .",

    "we also assume that the molecular gas is thermalized up to the j=21 transition , i.e. that the ratio in surface brightness between the 10 and 21 transition is unity , as is observed in the center of our galaxy and others ( braine & combes 1992 ; sawada et al . 2001 ) .",

    "this would correspond to an intensity of 173  @xmath124 and a mass of @xmath132 within a velocity interval of 300  @xmath7 . requiring @xmath131 detections in all channels over a 700  @xmath7 velocity interval",
    "corresponds to a mass sensitivity of @xmath133 .",
    "given the potential presence of correlated systematic errors , our results do not represent a definitive detection of co emission from molecular gas .",

    "the size of the disk is limited to within the bondi radius ( about 110  pc , 1.4for m87 ) .",
    "this is about the extent of the observed h@xmath22 disk in m87 ( ford et al .",
    "the observed velocity gradient of the h@xmath22 disk is along a position angle approximately perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "however , we do not find evidence for a velocity gradient in the potential co emission features in our data .",
    "the possibility of seeing co absorption features against an agn sub - mm continuum source has been discussed by , for example , barvainis & antonucci ( 1994 ) , maloney , begelman , & rees ( 1994 ) , wiklind & combes ( 1996 ) , and liszt & lucas ( 1998 ) .",
    "we do not expect local absorption of the nucleus from the 100  pc scale circumnuclear disk because of its large inclination angle to our line of sight .",
    "absorption due to co distributed on larger scales with m87 would be expected to produce a relatively narrow ( @xmath140 ) feature centered around the systemic velocity of the galaxy ( 1290  @xmath25 ) .",
    "this could explain the relative dearth of co emission that we see from 1000 - 1300  @xmath7 compared to the surrounding channels .",
    "estimating a reduction in flux of @xmath141  jy relative to the continuum level of 1.5  jy , implies @xmath142 . assuming this is constant over a 300  @xmath25 velocity range and using the conversion factor derived by wiklind & combes ( 1996 ) ( for 16  k molecular gas )",
    ", we estimate a total absorbing column @xmath143 so that @xmath144 .",
    "this is close to , but slightly lower than , the upper limits measured by braine & wiklind ( 1993 ) .",
    "thus it is possible that absorption by a larger scale distribution of co , if present in m87 , could have a significant influence on the appearance of any co emission spectrum from the circumnuclear disk , reducing the observed flux near the systemic velocity and thus causing its profile to assume a more double - peaked appearance .",
    "we have observed 230  ghz continuum emission from the nucleus and jet of m87 .",
    "the measured fluxes are generally consistent with those expected from synchrotron models of these components , although it is possible that thermal dust emission makes some sub - dominant contribution in the nucleus .",
    "the broad spectral coverage of our data allows us to determine the continuum level in regions of the spectrum that are expected to be free of line emission from any co that might be present . after continuum subtraction , we are left with a few potential emission features ( in 100  @xmath7 channels ) that are at strengths of about 3 - 4 times the continuum fluctuations in the line - free regions .",
    "these features may be due to systematic errors associated with the continuum subtraction .",
    "alternatively , if interpreted as co emission , the implied gas mass is about @xmath145 .",
    "our conservative estimate for the upper mass limit of molecular gas that is present in a 700  @xmath7 wide velocity range is also at about this level , i.e. @xmath133 . ignoring systematic errors ,",
    "as is typically done in such estimates , we have a @xmath3 mass sensitivity to about @xmath146 .",
    "the presence of molecular gas inside the bondi radius of m87 s central black hole is a strong discrimator of different accretion models .",
    "if present it would indicate that gas has been able to cool to low ( @xmath147  k ) temperatures , presumably in the confines of a thin accretion disk , whose presence is already indicated by the observations of atomic lines ( macchetto et al .",
    "this structure is not part of the paradigm of riaf models that are fed by bondi accretion ( e.g. di  matteo et al . 2003 ) .",
    "although a riaf could exist at the center of the disk , much closer to the black hole , the accretion flow at its outer boundary would only be that fraction of the mass flux making it through a potentially star - forming disk , not the unimpeded bondi accretion rate .",
    "the presence of molecular gas is a prediction of the star - forming accretion disk model of tb05 , in which strong gravitational instability in the disk causes most of the accreted mass to form stars at relatively low - luminosity rather than join the black hole .",
    "the predicted molecular gas mass is @xmath20 , which , while quite uncertain , is consistent with the observational constraints presented here .",
    "higher sensitivity observations are required to place more stringent constraints on the presence or not of molecular gas in the circumnuclear disk of m87 .",
