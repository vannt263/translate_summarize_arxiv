    "the standard model ( sm ) explains all the data from experiments so far , but many aspects of its underlying structure remain mysterious . as an immediate example , it is clear that local @xmath6 gauge invariance plays a huge role in its formulation , but it is not clear why nature made this choice , as opposed to some other one . given our lack of understanding , an obvious place to look for physics beyond the sm is by extending the gauge sector , and the simplest extension is an extra @xmath2 group factor . in fact , such an addition to the sm is also motivated by theoretical considerations .",
    "the gauge structure of the sm and its fermonic matter content both fit preternaturally into an @xmath7 grand unified theory ( gut ) .",
    "larger groups such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , motivated by uv completions of gravity , often contain remnant @xmath2s at low energies @xcite .",
    "the experimental hallmark of a @xmath2 extension is the existence of an electrically neutral spin one boson  a @xmath1 .",
    "provided the @xmath1 has couplings with sm quarks and leptons , it can be produced as a resonance at high energy hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "current searches for the reaction @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 or @xmath12 ) at the lhc have provided powerful bounds on this kind of scenario , requiring the @xmath1 mass to be larger than about 2.5  tev , if it has order one couplings to the sm fermions @xcite .",
    "more weakly coupled @xmath1s remain viable even at somewhat smaller masses .",
    "ultimately , a @xmath1 with order one couplings to both quarks and leptons is expected to be discovered at a high luminosity @xmath13  tev lhc run provided @xmath14 is less than about 4 - 5 tev @xcite . while a high luminosity lhc has excellent prospects to detect a @xmath1 , the relatively limited number of viable channels would nonetheless leave many questions about its nature unresolved .",
    "lepton colliders offer an alternative perspective on @xmath1 searches .",
    "a near - future @xmath0 collider is unlikely to reach lhc energies , but is expected to achieve an unprecedented precision that would allow it to be sensitive to virtual @xmath1s whose masses are far beyond the center - of - mass energy . in fact , bounds from lep ii remain interesting and relevant constraints on realistic @xmath1 models even in the current lhc era @xcite .    in this article , we examine the discovery potential of a future @xmath0 collider operating at @xmath15  gev collision energy to discover a @xmath1 . unlike earlier studies @xcite we focus on a set of models which are somewhat orthogonal generalizations of the usual @xmath9-inspired @xmath1 models @xcite , and focus on lower energy running options , @xmath16 and @xmath17 gev .",
    "these energies , while low enough to perhaps exclude the possibility of studying exotic states directly , would nonetheless allow for precision studies of the newly discovered @xcite higgs boson @xcite and electroweak interactions of the top quark @xcite .",
    "a completely generic @xmath2 model is described by a large number of parameters , including the mass , coupling , and widths , such as at the lhc , but is largely irrelevant for off - shell searches such as are more typical at @xmath0 colliders .",
    "] of the @xmath1 , as well as the couplings to the sm fermions and higgs boson .",
    "we specialize to the case in which the @xmath1 charges of the fermions are generation - independent , motivated by the desire to limit contributions to flavor - changing neutral currents at tree level @xcite .",
    "the important couplings are thus those to the left - handed quark doublet ( @xmath18 ) , the right - handed up - type quarks ( @xmath19 ) and down - type quarks ( @xmath20 ) , and to the lepton doublet ( @xmath21 ) and charged singlet ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "we further avoid strong electroweak precision constraints by choosing models for which the sm higgs is uncharged , preventing @xmath23-@xmath1 mixing at tree level .",
    "four interesting model - lines belonging to this class , and for which gauge anomalies can be cancelled by vector - like ( under the sm ) fermions are defined in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "each of these model - lines is further characterized by a continuous real parameter @xmath28 which parameterizes a freedom to choose the charges of the sm fermions under @xmath2 while maintaing the properties outlined above .",
    "the @xmath9 model points are contained as special values of @xmath28 ( for some of the model - lines ) within this wider framework @xcite . in addition , the gauge coupling , which multiplies the charge in each interaction , and the @xmath1 mass are independent parameters .",
    "the charges of the models in terms of @xmath28 are summarized in table  [ table : model_summary ] .",
    ".summary of the fermion charges for the four @xmath1 models considered , in terms of the continuous real parameter @xmath28 .",
    "[ table : model_summary ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the lhc limits suggest that a @xmath1 strongly enough coupled to be discoverable at a future high energy @xmath0 facility must have a mass well above the collider energy . as a result",
    ", it contributes to scattering virtually , effectively acting as a higher dimensional interaction which interferes with the sm contributions mediated by the photon and @xmath23 boson .",
    "we examine the rate for @xmath0 annihilation into electrons , muons , jets containing bottom quarks , and unflavored jets of hadrons ( initiated by @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , or @xmath32 quarks ) .",
    "we do not explicitly consider @xmath33 production , which is sensitive to poorly understood @xmath33-tagging rates at future detectors , or top production , which requires a more complicated analysis to identify the top decay products .",
    "both of these are worthwhile , but not likely to make up the bulk of a @xmath1 signal for our benchmark model - lines .",
    "the influence of the @xmath1 on the rate of a given channel depends on how it interferes with the sm amplitudes , leading either to an increase or depression compared to the sm expectation .",
    "we simulate the leading order rate with madgraph  5 @xcite , with the showering and hadronization performed by pythia @xcite and then simulate the detector response using pgs @xcite .",
    "we examine three different center - of - mass energies for the @xmath0 collisions , @xmath16 and 500  gev and a total data set of @xmath34 integrated luminosity . for each energy , we determine the expected number of events in each channel assuming the sm is correct , and that the uncertainty in this quantity is dominated by the statistical error analyses @xcite . ] .",
    "we consider a given parameter point discoverable if it leads to a deviation of @xmath35 in the expected rate .",
    "we draw contours in the plane of the @xmath1 mass versus @xmath28 for fixed @xmath2 gauge coupling @xmath36 , delineating the regions of parameter space in which a @xmath1 is observable .",
    "it is worth noting that for much of the parameter space considered here , a high luminosity lhc would presumably discover the @xmath1 before a future high energy @xmath0 collider begins operation .",
    "we choose @xmath35 as a case where the @xmath0 collider can definitively identify the presence of the @xmath1 in a given channel and also measure the deviation in that channel to order @xmath37 .",
    "we summarize our findings in a series of figures for each @xmath1 model , showing the bounds that can be placed on each model - line in the parameter space of the @xmath1 mass and @xmath28 , for each production channel individually , as well as the inclusive rate of all channels combined . in figures  [ fig : model_equality_tcx]-[fig : model_equality_bcx ] , we show the bounds on @xmath24 , where all fermions charges are equal to @xmath28 ( which may then itself be interpreted as the @xmath38 gauge coupling ) .",
    "the plots illustrate regions where a @xmath35 deviation from the sm expected rate is realized , in the plane of the @xmath1 mass and the coupling ( equivalent to @xmath28 for @xmath24 ) .",
    "we choose not to present results for @xmath1 masses below 500 gev , where on - shell production becomes possible , and the bounds depend sensitively on the @xmath1 width .    for @xmath24 , the strongest bounds at a given collider energy come from the electron channel , largely because of the fact that the @xmath1 can contribute via both @xmath39-channel as well as @xmath31-channel feynman diagrams . as a result ,",
    "the inclusive and electron - specific bounds are similar .",
    "the results indicate that even at 200 gev , @xmath1 masses up to around 4 tev can be discovered for order one couplings , with the difficult - to - discover region lying in the regime of small coupling and large mass .",
    "this parameter space is likely to have been already covered by the high energy lhc run @xcite , but already at 300 gev , the @xmath0 collider is expected to have a somewhat longer reach .",
    "these trends continue to be evident in other types of @xmath1 models .",
    "@xmath25 is very similar to the model with universal couplings , except for @xmath40 ( where searches involving leptons in the initial or final states are hopeless ) .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : model_inequality_ecx ] , the coverage based on the electron final state is essentially the same as for @xmath24 , and this limit continues to dominate the other channels for the same reasons .",
    "one different feature is the fact that the over - all sign of the @xmath1 contribution to jet final states is controlled by the sign of the parameter @xmath28 , leading to very different results ( shown in figures  [ fig : model_inequality_jcx ] and [ fig : model_inequality_bcx ] ) for positive and negative @xmath28 values .",
    "the differences in rates would be helpful in disentangling the nature of a @xmath1 signal . even in cases where one would expect the lhc to have made an initial discovery and measured @xmath41 , the sign of @xmath28 can be determined even with relatively modest @xmath0 collision energy .",
    "the results for @xmath26 illustrate a case where the couplings vary more widely with the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0 final state , illustrated in figure  [ fig : model_3_ecx ] , continues to provide the over - all best limit for most values of @xmath28 .",
    "the fact that the coupling to right - handed leptons is fixed , whereas the sign of the coupling to @xmath21 is determined by the sign of @xmath28 ; introduces a noticeable asymmetry to the discoverable region , which becomes much more pronounced in the reach using untagged jets ( figure  [ fig : model_3_jcx ] ) , and @xmath4-tagged jets ( figure  [ fig : model_3_bcx ] ) .",
    "once again , it is clear that valuable information about the pattern of couplings to various sm fermions can be inferred from a multi - channel analysis , giving clues as to the nature of a @xmath1 signal if one is observed .",
    "this model also illustrates the utility of running at different energies , which changes the interplay between the @xmath1 exchange amplitude squared compared with its interference with the standard model amplitudes . at low @xmath1 masses ,",
    "the two are comparable and regions of parameter space exist where , for example ( in the @xmath0 final state ) , the collider configuration with @xmath42  gev can have a slightly improved reach compared to the @xmath43  gev configuration , owing to cancellations between the two terms .",
    "similar features are present in @xmath27 , shown in figures  [ fig : model_4_ecx ] .",
    "the @xmath0 final state remains the single most effective channel , and there are regions of parameter space around @xmath44 and @xmath1 masses slightly above 500 gev where the destructive interference at the 300 or 500 gev collider configuration weakens discovery potential compared to the 200 gev configuration .",
    "as noted above , even in cases where the lhc would be likely to discover a @xmath1 before a future @xmath0 collider begins operation , the @xmath0 environment can contribute much to refine the understanding of the @xmath1 model .",
    "as an example , we consider the case of @xmath25 with @xmath45 and @xmath46  tev .",
    "such a @xmath1 would not have been discovered in the current lhc data set , but is likely to be visible through the reaction @xmath47 in high luminosity running at @xmath13  tev @xcite .",
    "this observation would unambiguously establish the existence of a new resonance coupled to both quarks and leptons .",
    "however , even with high luminosity , the lhc is unlikely to be able to sift the decay into unflavored dijets from the large backgrounds @xcite , and for these parameters observation of a decay into @xmath48 is expected to be marginal @xcite .",
    "the lhc observation would provide a measurement of the @xmath1 mass , but its width would be far below the experimental resolution , and thus only weakly bounded from above .",
    "even at @xmath42  gev and with 100 @xmath49 , a future @xmath0 collider would do much to clarify the nature of such an lhc discovery . from figures [ fig :",
    "model_inequality_ecx]-[fig : model_inequality_bcx ] , we see that the expectation is that such a machine would observe only the @xmath50 channel , narrowing down the space of possible explanations to those where the coupling to leptons is roughly comparable to the coupling to quarks .",
    "comparison with figure  [ fig : model_equality_jcx ] indicates that the model with universal couplings would be strongly disfavored by the lack of a signal in jets . in terms of an interpretation within the framework of @xmath25 , such an observation",
    "would provide a measurement of @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , because the @xmath0 collider s primary observable is through interference with the sm process , the rate also provides information about the relative signs of the couplings .",
    "for example , from figure  [ fig : model_inequality_bcx ] , we see that for @xmath52 , no signal in @xmath4-flavored jets is expected to be visible , whereas for @xmath53 , a signal should be strongly visible .    for this particular example , even a low energy @xmath0 collider is able to essentially reconstruct much of the structure of the @xmath1 couplings through simple rate information .",
    "if polarized beams or forward - backward asymmetries are employed , one can further dissect the chiral structure of the couplings @xcite ( which in this example are vector - like ) .",
    "we have examined the discovery potential of a future @xmath0 collider to infer the existence of a @xmath1 based on its virtual influence over the rate of sm fermions production , looking at four well - motivated @xmath1 model - lines .",
    "we find that even at very modest energies of @xmath54  gev , the discovery potential is somewhat higher than for the lhc at design energy , and valuable information about the nature of the @xmath1 couplings can be inferred even for models that the lhc is expected to have already discovered .",
    "we have confined our discussion to the simplest rate - based observables ; angular variables and polarized beams can extract even more information @xcite .",
    "we leave such refinements for future work .",
    "a future @xmath0 facility has the potential to transform our understanding of the higgs boson . in this work ,",
    "we see that it also has interesting potential to search for physics beyond the standard model .",
