    "if the hierarchy problem is solved by strong dynamics we expect resonances to appear around the tev scale which will be hopefully within the reach of the lhc",
    ". producing these states would allow to determine precious informations about the symmetries and dynamics of the strong sector .",
    "for example in technicolor theories the electro - weak symmetry is spontaneously broken by strong dynamics according to the pattern @xmath1 and the dynamics of the techni - resonances plays an important role .    due to the notorious difficulties of theories without a higgs ,",
    "a logical possibility is that the higgs doublet itself is a composite state , as in this case the scale of strong dynamics could be larger , alleviating phenomenological problems .",
    "this can be most naturally realized if the higgs is a goldstone boson ( gb ) associated to the spontaneous breaking of a symmetry @xmath2 to @xmath3 , an idea which goes back to the 80s @xcite .",
    "one important ingredient of modern realizations is the mechanism of partial compositeness where the sm fermions and gauge fields mix to the composite states analogously to the photon-@xmath4 mixing in qcd .",
    "the simplest example based on the symmetry pattern @xmath5 was considered in @xcite in the context of randall - sundrum scenarios .",
    "these models are also dual to strongly coupled 4d theories through the ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "in this paper we provide a general 4d effective description of composite higgs models ( chm ) with partial compositeness ( see @xcite for a review and refs . )",
    ". our starting point will be the @xmath6model @xmath7 describing the low energy interactions of gbs .",
    "spin-1 resonances non - linearly realizing the symmetry can be very simply included by introducing an additional @xmath6model @xmath8 and gauging the diagonal subgroup of @xmath9 and @xmath2 . proceeding in the same way a tower of resonances can be included at will .",
    "fermionic resonances can be treated in a similar way . differently from other constructions we find it natural and economic to include complete @xmath2 multiplets .",
    "couplings to the elementary fields are simply accounted by adding kinetic terms for the sources associated to the operators of the composite sector .",
    "the motivation of our work is two - fold .",
    "given that the 5d theories under consideration are effective theories with a cut - off , it is natural to write an effective 4d lagrangian containing only the degrees of freedom below the cut - off : up to cut - off dependent effects the two theories will coincide .",
    "this is particularly useful because in phenomenologically relevant models only very few resonances lie below the cut - off .",
    "the same idea was considered in @xcite in the context of 5d models for qcd .",
    "moreover only the lowest resonances have a chance to be produced at the lhc , so for collider applications it is useful to write a truncation of the theory to the first multiplet of resonances .",
    "one practical advantage is that in this limit very simple , explicit formulas can be derived which are well suited for simulating the model at the lhc .",
    "our philosophy is here similar to the one of @xcite . in this ref .",
    "an effective lagrangian capturing the essential features of partial compositeness was considered but the full gb structure of the theory was not incorporated .",
    "this was also done recently in @xcite with a different construction from ours .",
    "since our framework is based on general symmetry principles it is also interesting to consider a fully 4d point of view and treat our effective theory with one set of @xmath2 multiplets on its own .",
    "this can be interesting because terms not obtained from the 5d theory can be added to the action compatibly with the symmetries which could be relevant phenomenologically",
    ". we will show in particular that they contribute to the @xmath0parameter allowing to reduce it for appropriate choice of the parameters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we develop the general formalism to include an arbitrary tower of spin-1 and spin-1/2 resonances in a theory with global symmetry @xmath2 spontaneously broken to @xmath3 .",
    "various limits are considered which reproduce in particular higher dimensional theories and the ccwz construction @xcite . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we apply our tools to the minimal composite higgs @xmath5 focusing on the case where a single @xmath10 multiplet of resonances is included .",
    "all the results can be conveniently expressed in terms of 2-point functions of the composite sector which are collected in appendix [ sec : a ] .",
    "the higgs potential is discussed in section [ sec:4 ] and appendix [ sec : b ] . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we study the effect of non - minimal terms in the effective action .",
    "conclusions are in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "couplings and decay widths of spin-1 resonances can be found in appendix [ appwidth ] .",
    "we wish to describe scenarios where higgs is gb of some strongly coupled sector with global symmetry @xmath2 spontaneously broken to a subgroup @xmath3 . in the simplest realization @xcite , on which we will focus later on , the coset structure is @xmath5 which delivers a single higgs doublet .",
    "our discussion however is general , relying solely on the symmetries of the theory , and could be applied for example to extended higgs sectors studied in @xcite .",

    "the gb structure has important consequences on the couplings of the higgs which was discussed in a model independent fashion in @xcite .",
    "in particular this encodes the relevant low energy consequences of 5d models such as @xcite .    to add resonances to this picture we extend the construction of @xcite , which was formulated in the context of qcd .",

    "the white site on the left corresponds to the global @xmath2 symmetry , while the grey ones are gauged . ]      starting from the gb lagrangian ( [ gblagrangian ] ) , a simple way to add vector resonances compatibly with the symmetries is to introduce a second @xmath6model field @xmath17 of @xmath18 .",
    "this can be parametrized by @xmath2 valued matrices transforming as @xmath19 a lagrangian manifestly invariant under a global @xmath20 symmetry spontaneously broken to @xmath3 containing spin 1 resonances ( @xmath21 ) is obtained by gauging the diagonal subgroup of @xmath9 and @xmath2 in eq .",

    "we have also included in the covariant derivative ( [ der_cov ] ) the gauging of @xmath27 . from the point of view of the composite sector",
    "this is a global symmetry so that @xmath28 is not a dynamical field and should be treated as an external classical source which is zero in the vacuum .",
    "these sources are useful to compute correlation functions of the global currents the theory : the path integral as a function of @xmath29 is the generating functional of the conserved currents .",
    "moreover , as we will see in the next section , the coupling to external fields ( corresponding to sm fermions and gauge fields ) is simply accounted by adding kinetic terms for the sources of the various fields .",
    "one can then determine the effects of the composite sector on the sm fields in terms of the correlation functions of the composite sector .",
    "this procedure can be generalized in an obvious way to add a tower of resonances by adding @xmath6model fields @xmath30 and gauging nearest neighbor diagonal groups .",
    "one finds the moose lagrangian depicted in figure [ fig:1 ] , @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] and @xmath33 .",
    "the spectrum now contains @xmath34 @xmath2 multiplets of massive spin-1 resonances .",
    "the breaking @xmath7 is triggered by the last @xmath6model .",
    "the gbs associated to the breaking @xmath7 can be identified with the combination , @xmath35 to make manifest the particle content of the theory it is useful to choose a gauge where the gbs do not mix with the heavy gauge bosons .",
    "this is given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the scale @xmath38 can be conveniently chosen to be the decay constant of the gbs in the theory . from the nomalization of the kinetic terms",
    "one quickly derives , @xmath39      fermions can be treated in a similar way with one subtlety .",
    "the simplest option is to assume that the composite sector contains dirac fermions arising from the strong dynamics .",
    "each sm chiral fermion will be associated to one ( or more ) @xmath2 multiplets of the strong sector .",
    "we will then add dirac fermions @xmath41 in a representation @xmath42 ( same at each site ) , in general reducible .    as for the gauge field",
    "we can write a lagrangian with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "for the states associated to the left - handed sm chiralities we will consider , @xmath43\\psi^{(r)}_n+\\sum_{n=1}^{n-1}{\\delta^{(r)}_n } \\left(\\ \\bar{\\psi}_{r , l}^{n-1}\\omega_n \\psi_{r , r}^{n } + h.c.\\right),\\nonumber\\\\ d^{\\mu}\\psi^{(r)}_n & = & \\partial^\\mu\\psi^{(r)}_n - i\\rho^\\mu_n\\psi^{(r)}_n,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while for right - handed fermions @xmath44 .",
    "the index @xmath45 refers to the irreducible representations of @xmath2 and summation is understood .",
    "the hopping terms written above are not the most general ones , connecting only the left chirality of the massive fermion at site @xmath46 to the right chirality of the fermion at site @xmath47 , as shown in figure [ fig:2 ] .",
    "this choice can be motivated as follows . as in the gauge sector the field on the first site",
    "@xmath48 is a classical source .",
    "differently however , we would like the associated operator to be chiral so that only one chirality of @xmath48 is identified as the source .",
    "this suggests to interpret at each site the left ( right ) fields as sources for the fields on the next site , while the right - handed ( left - handed ) fermions as independent dynamical fields .",
    "this leads to the lagrangian above .",

    "this formalism also allows to introduce composite massless fermions in a representation @xmath3 of the symmetry which will interact with the fields on the last site by means of the gbs .",
    "the effective lagrangians ( [ gauge ] ) , ( [ fermions ] ) and ( [ yuk ] ) are not the most general compatible with the symmetries of the theory and this provides powerful restrictions on the spectrum and the dynamics of the theory .",
    "consider the case with only one multiplet of resonances . to the gauge lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ gauge2site ] ) we can add the term , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is now obtained from the maurer - cartan form for @xmath55 .",
    "the addition of this term changes the gbs decay constant to @xmath56 while leaving the masses of composite gauge bosons unchanged .",
    "one important consequence is that the coupling of spin-1 resonances to gbs is also modified .",
    "while this term violates the logic of nearest neighbor interactions , there are several reasons to include it . in a phenomenological approach",
    "to qcd it is needed to better reproduce the data @xcite . in that case one",
    "finds that the best agreement is for @xmath57 .",
    "moreover if we imagine starting from a theory with many sites , we could integrate out the heavier states and write an effective lagrangian for the lighter ones . this term",
    "would then be induced at tree level .",
    "finally we expect these terms , appropriately suppressed , to be generated by quantum loops .    from a 5d point of view ( see below ) the term above corresponds to a non - local interaction .",
    "this should be suppressed if the 5d theory is weakly coupled .",
    "indeed one can see that such term , if large , tends to ruin the partial unitarization of the scattering of gbs that one achieves in a theory with nearest neighbor interactions ( see below ) .",
    "however phenomenologically interesting theories require strong coupling , so that just few resonances have a weakly coupled description .",
    "in this situation it is interesting to consider phenomenological consequences of ( [ f0term ] ) . as we will see in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "this term could be relevant for the decay of the resonances and contributes to the @xmath58 parameter .",
    "analogous terms could also be introduced for the fermions but we will not consider their effects in this paper .",
    "the reader will likely not have missed that the lagrangians ( [ gauge ] ) and ( [ fermions ] ) resemble the discretization of a 5d theory .",
    "our approach indeed is reminiscent of dimensional deconstruction @xcite .",
    "we wish to make the connection manifest",
    ". the discussion will follow the one in @xcite in the context of extra - dimensional models for qcd .",
    "let us first consider the gauge sector .",
    "the continuum limit is obtained by taking the number of sites @xmath59 with @xmath60}{g_5 ^ 2}\\frac{2\\,n}{l } , \\\\ & g_n^2 = \\frac{g_5 ^ 2}{a(z_n)}\\frac{n}{l } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are identified respectively the extra - dimensional gauge coupling and interval length .",
    "@xmath63 is a smooth function and @xmath64 .",
    "one can check that the lagrangian ( [ gauge ] ) reproduces a gauge theory in a space with metric @xmath65 .",
    "choosing couplings and decay constants an arbitrary metric can be obtained .",
    "this picture however is only true at the classical level .",
    "quantum mechanically the 5d gauge theory is a non - renormalizable effective theory meaningful only at energies below the 5d cut - off , @xmath66 as a consequence only the resonances below this energy scale are weakly coupled and can be trusted within the effective description while the heavier states parametrize cut - off dependent effects .",
    "the 4d theory is also an effective theory where the cut - off originates from the non - linearities of the @xmath6models . in a theory with",
    "just gbs the maximum cut - off would be @xmath67 ( corresponding to the scale where the scattering of gb becomes strongly coupled ) which is in general smaller than @xmath68 . in our lagrangian with nearest neighbor interactions the local cut - off is given by @xmath69 . from ( [ fpi ] )",
    "@xmath70 grows with the number of links .",
    "the cut - off is than larger that the naive cut - off and indeed one can show that the 5d one can be reproduced .",
    "the reason for this is that the resonances partially unitarize the scattering of gbs allowing the theory to be reliable up to energies parametrically higher than @xmath71 . in practice",
    "phenomenologically interesting theories demand the effective coupling of the higher dimensional theory to be rather strong so that just a few resonances will be captured in an effective description . in this sense",
    "the notion of an extra - dimension becomes rather ethereal as there is no regime where five - dimensional physics is recovered .",
    "in this situation it is natural to think of this theory as a 4d theory with just a few states .",
    "let us turn to the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry .",
    "in the language of the 5d theory the last site corresponds to the ir brane where the symmetry @xmath2 is spontaneously broken to @xmath3 .",
    "this is often achieved imposing neumann or dirichlet boundary conditions for the gauge fields associated to the broken or unbroken generators respectively . in the language of the deconstructed theory this corresponds to setting @xmath72 .",
    "such an infinite vev however is unlikely to be realized physically .",
    "a more physical picture is that some dynamics is responsible for the breaking of the symmetry in the ir producing a finite @xmath73 .",
    "we will leave @xmath73 as a free parameter in what follows .    in the fermion sector",
    "the discretization of the 5d theory is less trivial .",
    "usually theories obtained by naive discretization suffer from fermion doubling and need to be regulated by adding term of higher order in derivatives relevant for the deconstructed theory and irrelevant for continuum theory ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one can show that our fermionic action ( [ fermions ] ) has the correct continuum limit and this is in fact another motivation for our choice .      in the `` strongly interacting light higgs '' ( silh ) @xcite , the effective lagrangian for the higgs as a gb was studied , focusing on the low energy consequences of the symmetry .",
    "it can be seen that the leading order lagrangian in an expansion @xmath74 corresponds to our setup with one site ( no composite resonances ) and kinetic term for the sources corresponding to the sm fields . in the model with two or more sites integrating out the heavy resonances",
    "will generate higher order terms in @xmath74 of phenomenological importance in the low energy action , reproducing sub - leading terms with the appropriate power counting described in @xcite .",
    "our setup can then be considered as the extension of silh with resonances integrated in .",
    "this is of course mandatory to study the production of these states .",
    "a standard way to introduce spin 1 resonances into this picture is through the ccwz formalism , see @xcite for a recent study within @xmath5 . for spin 1 resonances in the adjoint of @xmath3",
    "this can be realized by considering gauge fields of @xmath3 with a lagrangian , @xmath75 note that spin 1 resonances in a different representation of @xmath3 can not be coupled in this way , since gauge fields are necessarily in the adjoint of the group .",
    "as we will see , the resonances in @xmath7 can play an important role . for matter fields instead",
    "any @xmath3 invariant lagrangian can be lifted to a @xmath2 invariant one with the aid of the gbs .    in our construction fields",
    "are complete @xmath2 multiplets so that we treat resonances in @xmath3 and @xmath7 on the same ground .",
    "this is quite natural in qcd where mesons fill complete representations of the chiral symmetry .",
    "we can however recover the ccwz lagrangian with only @xmath3 resonances starting from the model with one @xmath2 multiplet and taking @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ gauge2site ] ) . in this limit",
    "the spin-1 resonances in @xmath7 become infinitely heavy and one can easily check that one obtains the lagrangian ( [ ccwz ] ) .",
    "the non - nearest neighbor interaction , introduced in section [ sec:2.3 ] , is necessary to reproduce the most general lagrangian ( [ ccwz ] ) where @xmath38 and @xmath77 are different .    for the case of two sites with symmetry structure @xmath5 , on which we will focus in the rest of the paper ,",
    "our construction is philosophically similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , where however the non - linear gb structure was not included .",
    "roughly the lagrangian in @xcite can be understood as the truncation of the gb lagrangian to the lowest dimension operators .",
    "one difference is however that the higgs necessarily couples to the elementary fields in our case .",

    "@xcite to the gb higgs was also considered in ref .",

    "a `` little - higgs '' inspired 2-site model is described also in @xcite . ] . in that work",
    "the spontaneous breaking @xmath7 was realized by gauging a subgroup @xmath3 of the @xmath9 symmetry of the last @xmath6model @xmath78 .",
    "while this breaks explicitly the symmetry @xmath9 on the last site , it can be seen that the action describes the spontaneous breaking @xmath7 and contains incomplete @xmath2 multiplets .",
    "a different choice was also considered for the fermionic fields . in our construction",
    "we find it natural to start from the @xmath6model @xmath7 and add complete @xmath2 multiplets of resonances to this picture as explained above , effectively extending @xcite .",
    "for the gauge sector the setup of @xcite with @xmath79 sites can be recovered starting from our @xmath80sites lagrangian in the limit @xmath72 .",
    "in the previous section we discussed the features of the composite sector relevant to build chm where the higgs is a gb . we will now apply this framework to the minimal composite higgs of ref .",
    "@xcite . as in that work",
    ", we find it very useful to express our results in terms of the correlation functions of the composite sector which we collect in appendix [ sec : a ] .",
    "we will focus on the case with two sites depicted figure [ fig:2-site ] , even though the formulas in terms of the correlation functions are general .",
    "there are two main reasons for this choice .",
    "most importantly the 2-site lagrangian contains only the states which might be accessible at the lhc capturing the relevant features of all chm with partial compositeness .",
    "secondly this truncation allows to obtain extremely simple formulas depending on few parameters which are ready made to simulate the scenario at the lhc .",

    "the breaking can be parametrized by the vev of a vector of @xmath10 so that the gauge lagrangian ( [ gauge2site ] ) can be written explicitly as=\\delta^{ab}$ ] .",

    "however this does not play a role in what follows so we will omit it ( except for taking into account the color factors ) .    having discussed the composite sector , the next step is to introduce sm fermions and gauge fields",
    ". practically this amounts to adding kinetic terms for the sources of the operators of the composite sector to which the sm field couple and setting to zero non - dynamical fields . to gauge the sm gauge symmetry",

    "there exists also the possibility that one chirality , typically the right - handed top , is part of the strong sector in which case no elementary component exists but we will not consider it here . to determine the model we just need to specify to which sources the elementary fields correspond .",
    "this in general depends on the fermionic representation of the composite sector .",
    "the elementary lagrangian explicitly breaks the global symmetry of the theory so that the gbs become approximate . in particular the vev becomes physical and the vacuum alignment determines the electro - weak vev .",
    "the main consequences are the generation of mass terms for @xmath99 and @xmath100 and yukawa couplings for sm fermion .",

    "<S> we propose a four dimensional description of composite higgs models which represents a complete framework for the physics of the higgs as a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson . </S>",
    "<S> our setup captures all the relevant features of 5d models and more in general of composite higgs models with partial compositeness . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the minimal scenario where we include a single multiplet of resonances of the composite sector , as these will be the only degrees of freedom which might be accessible at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> this turns out to be sufficient to compute the effective potential and derive phenomenological consequences of the theory . </S>",
    "<S> moreover our simplified approach is well adapted to simulate these models at the lhc . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider the impact of non - minimal terms in the effective lagrangian which do not descend from a 5d theory and could be of phenomenological relevance , for example contributing to the @xmath0parameter . </S>"
