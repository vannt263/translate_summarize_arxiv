    "concept of fractional derivative , in particular , became popular , because it is more suitable for modeling certain real world problem than the regular derivative .",
    "various type of fractional derivatives and their applications can be found in one of the most cited monographs , related to the fractional calculus @xcite .    without neglecting the huge amount of work , devoted to theoretical development and applications of fractional derivatives to various branches of sciences",
