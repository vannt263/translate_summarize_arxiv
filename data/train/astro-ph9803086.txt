    "one of the most promising source of gravitational waves is the coalescence of inspiralling compact binaries .",
    "the recent development of interferometric gravitational waves detectors ( _ e.g .",
    "geo600 , ligo , tama _ and _ virgo _ ) gives an important motivation for studying this problem .",
    "such a study requires a relativistic formalism to derive the equations of motion and then an accurate and tricky method to solve the resulting system of partial differential equations .",
    "we have recently @xcite proposed a relativistic formalism able to tackle the problem of co - rotating _ as well as _",
    "counter - rotating binaries system , these latter being more relevant from the astrophysical point of view .",
    "we present now a very accurate approach based on multi - domain spectral method that circumvents the gibbs phenomenon to numerically solve this problem and which can be applied to a wide class of other astrophysical situations .",
    "various astrophysical applications of spectral methods have been developed in our group ( for a review , see @xcite ) , including 3-d gravitational collapse of stellar core @xcite , neutron star collapse into a black hole @xcite , tidal disruption of a star near a massive black hole @xcite , rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite , magnetized neutron stars @xcite and their resulting gravitational radiation @xcite , spontaneous symmetry breaking of rapidly rotating neutron stars @xcite , proto - neutron stars evolution @xcite .    in computational fluid dynamics ,",
    "spectral methods are known for their very high accuracy @xcite ; indeed for a @xmath1 function , the numerical error decreases as @xmath2 ( _ evanescent error _ ) , where @xmath3 is the number of coefficients involved in the spectral expansion , or equivalently the number of grid points in the physical domain .",
    "this is much faster than the error decay of finite - difference methods , which behaves as @xmath4 , with @xmath5 generally not larger than @xmath6 .",
    "for this reason , spectral methods are particularly interesting for treating 3-d problems  such as binary configurations  a situation in which the number of grid points is still severely limited by the capability of present and next generation computers .",
    "spectral methods lose much of their accuracy when non - smooth functions are treated because of the so - called _",
    "gibbs phenomenon_. this phenomenon is well known from the most familiar spectral method , namely the theory of fourier series : the fourier coefficients @xmath7 of a function @xmath8 which is of class @xmath9 but not @xmath10 decrease as @xmath11 only .",
    "in particular , if the function has some discontinuity , its approximation by a fourier series does not converge towards @xmath8 at the discontinuity point : there remains a gap which is of the order 10% .",
    "the multi - domain spectral method described in this paper circumvents the gibbs phenomenon .",
    "the basic idea is to divide the space into domains chosen so that the physical discontinuities are located onto the boundaries between the domains ( sect .",
    "[ s : mapping ] ) .",
    "the simplest example is the case of a perfect fluid star , where two domains may be distinguished : the interior and the exterior of the star .",
    "the boundary is then simply the surface of the star .",
    "the second ingredient of the technique is a mapping between the domains defined in this way and some simple mathematical domains , which are cross products of intervals : @xmath12 \\times [ b_1,b_2 ] \\times [ c_1,c_2]$ ] .",
    "the spectral expansion is then performed with respect to functions of the coordinates spanning these intervals ( sect .",

    "the method of resolution of a basic equation , namely the poisson equation , is exposed in sect .",
    "[ s : resol_poisson ] . for stiff equations of state ,",
    "the above procedure is not sufficient to ensure the smoothness of all the functions .",
    "indeed , for a polytrope with an adiabatic index greater than 2 , the density field has an infinite derivative on the surface of the star .",
    "we present in sect .  [",
    "s : regul ] a method for regularizing the density and recover the spectral precision .",
    "the power of the multi - domain spectral method is illustrated in sect .",

    "finally sect .",
    "[ s : conclu ] concludes the article by discussing the great advantages of the multi - domain spectral method for dealing with relativistic binary neutron stars .",
    "in order to treat problems involving poisson equations with non - compact sources  as they appear in relativistic gravitation  we take for the physical domain where the computation must be performed the whole three - dimensional space @xmath13 . in doing so , we know the physical boundary conditions we have to impose in order to solve the poisson equations .",
    "these boundary conditions can be easily set at infinity .",
    "we divide @xmath13 into @xmath14 domains @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) . in the present work ,",
    "these domains are taken to be _ star - like _ ( in the mathematical sense ) with respect to a some origin @xmath17 , which means that for every point @xmath18 in the domain @xmath19 , the segment @xmath20 is entirely included in @xmath21 ( see fig .  [",
    "f : domaine ] ) .",
    "the multi - domain spectral method we are going to describe can be extended to more general domains , at the price of a greater technical ( but non conceptual ) difficulty .",

    "the basic idea is to introduce a mapping [ e : map : gen ]    rcl [ 0,1][0,2 [ & & d_0 + ( , , ) & & ( r , , )    so that the origin @xmath17 corresponds to @xmath37 and the boundary @xmath25 to @xmath38 .",
