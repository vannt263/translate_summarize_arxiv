    "the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , realized in semiconductor heterostructures , has been a source of lasting inspiration for at least two generations of fundamental and applied researchers.@xcite in recent years , for example , a new gold rush has been triggered by the experimental discovery of a metallic phase at low temperature,@xcite in contrast with the scaling theory of localization in two dimensions ( 2d ) , @xcite and , independently , by the scientific and technological progress on quantum dots , which , at semiconductor interfaces , become nothing but tiny , quasi - two - dimensional quantum disks .",
    "@xcite    in this context , accurate predictions obtained from a simplified model , such as the ideal 2deg ( strictly 2d electrons interacting via a @xmath0 potential within a uniform , rigid neutralizing background ) , represent a valuable reference .",
    "for example , a recent analytic representation of quantum monte carlo correlation energies@xcite as a function of spin polarization @xmath1 and coupling parameter @xmath2 ( where @xmath3 is the density and @xmath4 is the bohr radius ) has been immediately picked by several authors , either because of its relevance to the phase diagram of the 2deg,@xcite or because of the corresponding prediction for the spin suceptibility,@xcite or , last but not least , because the analytic representation of the correlation energy versus @xmath3 and @xmath1 is a key ingredient for the density functional theory of quantum dots.@xcite    such an interest encouraged us to extend our previous work on energies to the spin - resolved pair - distribution functions @xmath5 of the 2deg , whose accuracy and availability in analytic form may serve a variety of purposes : the exchange - correlation hole and its dependence on the electron density and spin polarization may be relevant to the physics of the metal - insulator bifurcation in 2d@xcite and to self - energy theories of the 2deg,@xcite but is also needed for the estimate of the effects of the finite thickness on the spin susceptibility@xcite and for the construction of generalized - gradient approximations ( gga ) or weighted - density approximations ( wda ) of density functionals , in analogy to the 3d case.@xcite the availability of density functionals better than local - spin - density ( lsd ) approximations for the 2deg would , in turn , allow an almost exact description of quantum dots , since the spatial variation of their carrier density is rather weak.@xcite    in this paper , we exploit the known exact properties of the pair - distribution functions ( recalled in sec .
