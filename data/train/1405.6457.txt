    "the current research situation surrounding the small - size heat engines looks almost exactly like the one in 1700s surrounding the macroscopic heat engines , on the night before the appearance of thermodynamics .",

    "it is also clarifying the functions of bio - moleculars , which are micro - machines in nature @xcite .",
    "we can not apply the standard thermodynamics to these small - size heat engines as it is , because it is a phenomenology for macroscopic systems .",
    "therefore , we do nt know the limit of the performance of the small - size heat engines yet ; we need the thermodynamics of the small - size systems .",
    "based on the above situation , many researches report statistical mechanical analysis of the features the small - size heat engines whose small - size working body is connected to the infinitely large heat baths @xcite .",
    "they clarify that the average performance of these small - size heat engines obeys the second law of the macroscopic thermodynamics @xcite , and that the single - shot performance of the heat engines obeys different rules @xcite .",
    "they also clarifies the thermodynamic laws for processes with measurement and feedback @xcite .",

    ", the macroscopic thermodynamics can treat the macroscopic finite - size heat baths . in the macroscopic region ,",
    "the macroscopic thermodynamics give the optimal upper bounds of the performance of the heat engines with finite - size heat baths .",
    "therefore , it is natural to wonder the following questions ; how small are the baths such that the thermodynamical bounds lose the optimality ? what is the quantitative size of the  macroscopic system ? \" in order to answer these questions , we need to treat the finite - size heat baths in the statistical mechanics framework , and to compare the macroscopic thermodynamic laws and the statistical machanical results .    in the present article",
    ", we establish a novel method to approach the finite - size heat baths .",
    "our method is based on the information geometry @xcite and the strong large deviation @xcite , and give the following two results;@xmath1 _ ( r1 ) optimal efficiency for heat engines with finite - size heat baths : _ we give the optimal efficiency of heat engines with @xmath0-particle heat baths . by comparing the true optimal efficiency with",
    "the macroscopic thermodynamical bound , we show that the prediction of macroscopic thermodynamics for the optimal efficiency is accurate up to the order @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the extracted heat from the hot heat bath . @xmath1 _ ( r2 ) evaluation of the quality of the extracted energy : _ we give the optimal work extraction as a concrete time evolution among the heat baths and the work storage , without assuming the quasi - static operation .",
    "we also evaluate the ratios of the entropy differences to the energy differences in the heat baths and the work storage , respectively",
    ". the entropy - energy ratio of the work storage is so negligibly small as compared with that of the heat baths , i.e. , our optimal work extraction turns the disordered energy of the heat baths to the ordered energy of the work storage .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ] ,",
    "we give our set up from statistical mechanical approach , and discuss the heat engines from thermodynamics . in section [ s2 ] , we give our mains results .",
    "all of the theorems except for theorem 1 will be shown in the main text , and all of the propositions will be shown in appendix .",
    "in the present article , we treat both of classical and quantum heat engines .",
    "although the true physical system will be described in the quantum case , we firstly discuss a classical heat engine as a preparation of our quantum heat engine because the model of a quantum heat engine is more complicated .",
    "indeed , the modern formulation of the work extractions was originally given for the closed classical systems , by jarzynski @xcite . since",
    "our work extraction formulation is a natural extension of his formulation to the quantum case , it is better to discuss the classical heat engine before our quantum heat engine . further , it is usual to discuss a classical system for simplicity in statistical mechanics @xcite .",

    "next , we introduce the work extraction process . originally , jarzynski formulated the work extraction process as an invertible and deterministic dynamics in the classical system @xcite . in this paper , we employ a stochastic extension of his formulation @xcite , i.e. , we describe the dynamics of the above internal system @xmath8 as a probability transition matrix @xmath19 .",
