    "some of the most successful and most promising electronics applications of superconductors involve josephson junctions , where two superconducting regions are coupled through a barrier region , made from a non - superconducting material  @xcite .",
    "the drive to make electronic devices using josephson junctions has been motivated by their naturally high operating frequencies , far in excess of the speeds obtainable in standard silicon technology .",
    "the operational frequency of an ideal josephson junction using rapid single flux quantum ( rsfq ) logic is @xmath3 , where @xmath0 is the critical current , and @xmath1 is the normal state resistance of the junction  @xcite .",
    "hence a maximum value of the product , @xmath2 leads to optimal performance . at present ,",
    "low temperature superconductors have been used to produce junctions with @xmath2 products up to 1mv , and operational speeds reaching @xmath4 ghz  @xcite , while junctions of high - temperature superconductors have achieved @xmath2 products reaching from @xmath5 mv to @xmath6 mv  @xcite .",
    "the choice of barrier material strongly affects both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( typically poor conductors increase @xmath1 but reduce @xmath0 ) so it is appropriate to study in detail what properties of the junction modify @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , it has been suggested  @xcite , that the maximum value of the product would be reached when the barrier material is close to a metal - insulator transition , so that the system is near the cross - over from an sns to an sis junction . in order to investigate such non - trivial barrier materials ,",
    "we develop a microscopic model of a josephson junction , which self - consistently incorporates the dynamical correlation effects of the electrons in calculating the conductance of the junction and the critical current .",
    "our model is also appropriate for ballistic junctions that have relatively pure barrier regions so that the extent of the barrier is smaller than its mean - free - path but larger than its proximity - effect - induced superconducting correlation length .",
    "much work has progressed on these systems recently , with a concentration on niobium - indium arsenide - niobium junctions or niobium - silicon - niobium junctions .",
    "recent work includes an examination of subgap structures and current deficits  @xcite , quasiparticle reflection effects and spikes in the conductance  @xcite , effects of multiple andreev reflection and noise in stacked junctions  @xcite , and an investigation of a tunable junction that can be altered from an ordinary junction to a @xmath7-junction by driving the barrier into a nonequilibrium state via a transverse electrical current  @xcite .",
    "the above - mentioned experimental and theoretical work has concentrated on nonequilibrium effects that occur at finite voltages .",
    "this contribution will address only equilibrium and linear - response properties of the microscopic model for josephson junctions , but our work can be extended to examine such nonequilibrium effects as well .",
    "josephson junctions consist of two superconducting regions coupled through an intermediate region which is not naturally superconducting .",
    "the main characteristics of a josephson junction can be understood by just considering two superconductors coupled together with a single , energy independent transmissivity parameter .",
    "the dc josephson effect , of a direct supercurrent through the junction at zero external voltage , and the ac josephson effect of an oscillating , dissipative current at finite voltage were both predicted from such a simple model  @xcite .",
    "further details of the i - v characteristics , such as excess current and sub - harmonic gap structure due to andreev bound states were explained  @xcite , by matching boundary conditions across a step - function in the superconducting potential , and including an adjustable scattering potential at the interfaces  @xcite .",
    "analytic calculations have been performed to provide current - phase relationships  @xcite , representing the barrier as a single scattering potential with no spatial extent . in this contribution",
    "we compare these traditional approaches with a more microscopic model .",
    "originally the term josephson junction referred to superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( @xmath8 ) tunnel junctions , but here we use the term in its common usage to refer to all `` weak links '' , including superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( @xmath9 ) junctions . in the latter case , the barrier region can occupy tens to hundreds of nanometres , as the proximity effect ensures that the superconductivity extends into the barrier region , decaying on the scale of the coherence length , @xmath10 when in the ballistic regime ( where the coherence length is longer than the mean free path in the barrier ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method for studying the effects of the barrier region on the strength of superconductivity it can support , and hence on the supercurrent it can maintain .",
    "effects of electron correlations are incorporated within the dynamic mean field theory  @xcite , which leads to a local , frequency - dependent self - energy , which we allow to vary from one plane to the next , while assuming it to remain constant within individual planes .",
    "hence the three - dimensional system becomes inhomogeneous in the one dimension where the current flows ( which we label the z - direction ) .",
    "we model the system with two sets of @xmath11 planes of superconducting material coupled each on one side to the bulk superconductor , and on the other side sandwiching @xmath12 planes of barrier material as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : planes ] .",
    "the total number of planes modeled self - consistently is @xmath13 .",
    "we note that while in this paper we concentrate on applying the method to josephson junctions , our method would also be applicable to theoretical studies of correlated electrons at surfaces , single interfaces , or multiple interfaces , as first demonstrated by potthoff and nolting  @xcite .",
    "an important advantage of our scheme is that the different ( material specific ) microscopic models that best describe any particular material can be coupled together across the planes .",
    "hence a superconductor with electron - phonon coupling described by a holstein model  @xcite ( or even using the appropriate @xmath14 in migdal - eliahberg theory ) can be connected to a metallic region with impurities described by the falicov - kimball model ( or a correlated hubbard model ) , and so on .",
    "the local self energy for each plane is calculated independently , according to the model best - suited to the particular material .",
    "once a set of local self - energies are evaluated for each plane , the green s functions are calculated by finding the inverse of an infinite matrix which includes planes of bulk superconductor extending in the positive and negative z - direction . the inversion process , which is made tractable by a continued fraction representation , couples all of the different planes together , such that a change in the self energy on one plane affects the local interacting green s functions on all other planes , particularly those nearby in real space .    in order for a supercurrent to flow , a phase gradient must be applied to the superconductor and across the barrier region .",
    "the critical current , @xmath0 , is reached , when the planes with the lowest superconducting order , typically at the center of the barrier region , can no longer support the necessary phase gradient to maintain current continuity . in our model",
    "we find the supercurrent as a function of phase variation across the barrier , by solving the system self - consistently at each set of phases .",
    "the self - consistency is crucial  @xcite , as the existence of a current flow affects the value of the superconducting order parameter , both inside and outside the barrier region .",
    "section ii contains a detailed description of our method , including the physical approximations used , and the general computer algorithm . in section",
    "iii we analyze the current - phase relationships of our results in terms of the transmissivity of a barrier .",
    "the results presented in section iv demonstrate the efficacy of the method to solve some simple models of josephson junctions , using the bogoliubov - de gennes equations , where we demonstrate the effects of self - consistency , in particular on the superconducting order and electron density .",
    "section v includes the results for barriers with impurity scattering , with a description of the calculations of normal - state resistance , and results of resistance and @xmath2 products .",
    "we conclude in section vi with some comments on the results , and suggestions of other situations well - suited to our model .",
    "our method consists of two stages .",
    "first , we determine the properties of the bulk boundary regions for a uniform system . when no current flows in the bulk ( homogeneous ) superconductor , dynamical mean field theory  @xcite is employed to determine the local self energy , using the local approximation .",
    "when a uniform current is flowing , one must include a uniform phase variation in the superconducting order parameter , @xmath15 , for the bulk system .",
    "next , we solve the inhomogeneous problem self - consistently by iteration , for a number of planes , @xmath16 , coupled on either side to the uniform bulk solution . that is , giving the plane an index , @xmath17 , and defining the central link of the junction to be between planes @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we include @xmath12 barrier planes , surrounded by @xmath20 self - consistently calculated superconductor planes on each side , such that @xmath21 and planes with index , @xmath22 or @xmath23 are invariant homogeneous bulk planes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : planes ] ) .",
    "typically , we solve systems with @xmath24 , which is significantly greater than the coherence length for our bulk superconductor ( @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the lattice spacing ) .",
    "we observe that , except when very close to @xmath27 , the superconducting order has completely healed from its disruption at the interface , by the time we reach the planes at the bulk superconductor boundary ( planes with @xmath28 ) .",
    "we describe the system with the following tight - binding model : @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are fermionic operators which respectively create and destroy an electron of spin-@xmath32 in a single wannier ( tight - binding ) state on the lattice site @xmath33 ; @xmath34 with @xmath35 the overlap or hopping integral for the @xmath17-th plane , @xmath36 the local site energy , @xmath37 the renormalized on - site , hubbard interaction energy , @xmath38 the impurity potential , and @xmath39 if there is an impurity on site @xmath33 , and @xmath40 otherwise . the magnitude of the hopping integral in the superconducting region , @xmath41 , is constant , and defines our energy scale for the entire system ( @xmath42 ) . in all results that we present here ,",
    "the superconducting region has an attractive hubbard interaction , @xmath43 and no impurities ( @xmath40 for all sites on planes @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "we utilize the spinless falicov - kimball model to describe non - magnetic charge impurities within the barrier region .",
    "the interaction between dopant atoms and conduction electrons is attractive , and represented by a negative @xmath38 .",
    "the average impurity concentration within the barrier is given by , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the total number of barrier sites .",
    "we also consider systems where there are no impurities within the barrier , but there is a hubbard interaction for sites within the barrier , @xmath48 , that differs from @xmath43 in the superconductor .",
    "in addition , we have included systems where the hopping integral , @xmath49 , differs in the barrier region , and where the interfacial planes ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 only ) have a non - zero local on - site potential , @xmath52 .",
    "we use the matrix formulation of nambu  @xcite for the green s function , @xmath53 , between two lattice sites @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the matsubara frequency , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and the corresponding local self energy , @xmath58 the diagonal and off - diagonal green s functions are defined respectively as : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes time - ordering in @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the self energies and green s functions are coupled together through dyson s equation , @xmath63 where we have included the local approximation for the self energy , @xmath64 , [ which can be relaxed if we use the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca )  @xcite ] .",
    "the non - interacting green s function , @xmath65 is diagonal in nambu space , with upper diagonal component given by : @xmath66 we emphasize that @xmath67 is the non - interacting green s function and is _ not _ the effective medium of an equivalent atomic problem ( see below for athe detailed algorithm used to solve the dynamical mean field theory ) .",
    "a major innovation in our work is to utilize an efficient hybrid real - space  momentum - space method for calculating the green s functions from the set of local self - energies .",
    "we find this method to be much more powerful in solving systems with spatial variations or inhomogeneity , and it is also faster in bulk systems with current flow than a more conventional @xmath68-space integral technique .    since the stacked planes have translational symmetry within the plane , the systems that we study are inhomogeneous in one direction only .",
    "we choose that direction to be labeled the z - axis , which is also the direction of current flow through the josephson junction .",
    "the first stage of our method is to convert the problem from a three - dimensional system to a one - dimensional system following the algorithm of potthoff and nolting  @xcite .",
    "we perform a fourier transform within the planes to determine the planar indexed green s functions , @xmath69,\\ ] ] where @xmath17 and @xmath70 denote distinct planes , defined by @xmath71 , @xmath72 and the summation is over all lattice sites , @xmath73 , within the @xmath70-th plane . the self energy , @xmath74 , is independent of the planar coordinates @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so that dyson s equation [ eq .  ( [ eq : dys ] ) ] becomes @xmath77 with the summation over all planes , @xmath78 .",
    "the non - interacting planar green s function , is similarly found by the fourier transform @xmath79.\\ ] ]    the local green s function , @xmath80 , is required for calculating the self - consistent potentials , and the green s function @xmath81 between two neighboring sites , @xmath82 and @xmath83 is required for current calculations .",
    "these are given by the simple planar momentum integrals : @xmath84 where again , @xmath85 and @xmath72 , and the phase factors in the integral have canceled as @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "hence our goal is to find the interacting green s functions , @xmath88 .",
    "we make a huge improvement ( by one to two orders of magnitude ) in the computational efficiency by transforming the two - dimensional planar momentum integral into a single integral over in - plane kinetic energy . in the case of nearest - neighbor hopping on a square lattice ,",
    "the kinetic energy within the @xmath17-th plane is given by @xmath89 = \\frac{t_{\\alpha}}{t } \\overline{\\varepsilon^{xy}}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is the hopping integral between two nearest - neighbor sites within the @xmath17-th plane and @xmath26 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the effect of the in - plane kinetic energy is equivalent to an increase in the on - site energy , @xmath90 which can vary between the different planes .",
    "the planar green s functions only depend on the planar momentum via the normalized kinetic energy , @xmath91 $ ] , such that @xmath92 .",
    "hence , by using the two - dimensional density of states , @xmath93 , for a square lattice , the momentum integral is transformed into @xmath94 the specific hopping integral , @xmath49 , for each plane affects the on - site potential of a given plane in the continued fraction method [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : amatrix ] ) below ] , but does not contribute to the change of variables in the momentum integral .",
    "once the system is converted to a one - dimensional model , with nearest - neighbor hopping , the green s functions can be solved rapidly by a continued fraction expansion , without recourse to another @xmath95-space integral for the @xmath96-direction .",
    "the continued fraction expansion is similar to the recursion method@xcite , modified to include superconductivity  @xcite , but with three important differences .",
    "first , the method is much faster , as there is no need to expand about a site to obtain a new basis  the system is already one - dimensional in form .",
    "second , there is no inaccuracy in the termination process , as the hopping integrals are given exactly in the model .",
    "the third point is an alteration , because the sites of interest are not at the end of a chain , but in the middle .",
    "this leads to a different set of continued fractions that must be calculated compared with the standard recursion method . in test runs",
    ", our method proves to be @xmath97 times faster , and with machine precision accuracy , compared to a standard recursion method expansion which is terminated ( due to memory limits ) at an accuracy of one part in @xmath98 !",
    "an alternate approach is to solve dyson s matrix equation directly for a finite system , where the infinitely extended bulk boundaries can be mimicked by appropriate choice of potentials for the end planes .",
    "we have carried out such an approach as a comparison , but find it to be much slower ( by a factor of 4000 for 60 planes than our method , and it grows like @xmath99 for large systems with @xmath16 planes ) so we only describe the continued - fraction method below .",
    "the equivalence of our method to the recursion method is that we calculate the green s functions directly from a continued - fraction representation of the inverse of the hamiltonian matrix in real space .",
    "that is , we find @xmath100 where the matrices @xmath101 are the total in - plane energies for a particular plane , given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 couple the @xmath104th and @xmath17th planes , @xmath105 the local planar green s function , @xmath106 , is readily evaluated as a combination of continued fractions ( as in the renormalized perturbation expansion  @xcite ) .",
    "we define the right - directed , @xmath107 , and left - directed @xmath108 continued fractions from a plane , @xmath17 , recursively as @xmath109 the recursive calculation continues to infinity , but once it has been extended to planes in the uniform bulk medium , where @xmath22 or @xmath23 , the coefficients at each level become constant .",
    "the effect of a constant phase gradient in @xmath110 is equivalent to a constant phase factor in the hopping integral , @xmath111 , that does not change between planes in the bulk .",
    "hence , by equating all @xmath112 as @xmath113 for @xmath23 and @xmath114 as @xmath115 for @xmath22 in the bulk limit , an exact terminator function can be calculated as the solution of a complex quadratic matrix equation : @xmath116   \\underline{\\underline{b}}_{\\infty}^{\\dagger -1 } \\underline{\\underline{r}}_{\\infty}(i\\omega_{n},\\overline{\\varepsilon^{xy } } ) +   \\underline{\\underline{b}}_{\\infty } & = & \\underline{\\underline{0}}\\\\ \\underline{\\underline{l}}_{\\infty}(i\\omega_{n},\\overline{\\varepsilon^{xy } } ) \\underline{\\underline{b}}_{\\infty}^{-1 } \\underline{\\underline{l}}_{\\infty}(i\\omega_{n},\\overline{\\varepsilon^{xy } } )   + \\left [ \\underline{\\underline{a}}_{\\infty } -   i\\omega_{n}\\underline{\\underline{1}}\\right ]   \\underline{\\underline{b}}_{\\infty}^{-1 } \\underline{\\underline{l}}_{\\infty}(i\\omega_{n},\\overline{\\varepsilon^{xy } } ) +   \\underline{\\underline{b}}^{\\dagger}_{\\infty } & = & \\underline{\\underline{0 } } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the same terminator function is used for all sites in the intermediate layers , and the functions @xmath117 and @xmath118 calculated for one site are used in the calculation for the next site  so the number of computations required to find solutions for all sites can be less than @xmath119 .",
    "there are two ways to solve this matrix quadratic equation .",
    "when we perform calculations on the real axis , without including a supercurrent , the matrix equation becomes analytically tractable to solve .",
    "on the imaginary axis , we find that it is numerically faster to simply find an iterative solution to these quadratic equations within the bulk medium . in most cases , accuracies of one part in @xmath120",
    "can be achieved in ten iterations or less .",

    "we will need only the local , and nearest - neighbor bulk green s functions in our calculations .      in this contribution ,",
    "the superconducting region is modeled by the negative - u hubbard model within the hartree - fock ( static mean - field ) approximation . in this case , the local self energy is found from the local green s functions by : @xmath137 and @xmath138 where the instantaneous electron - electron interaction energy , @xmath139 , leads to a time - independent self energy .",
    "this procedure is identical to the conventional bogoliubov - de gennes approach  @xcite , which neglects retardation effects in the superconductor .",
    "as all sites within a plane are identical , the self energy need only be calculated once for each of the @xmath16 planes .    for planes within the barrier which include impurities ,",

    "the method , which is solved for a fixed concentration of impurities , @xmath146 , is equivalent to the coherent potential approximation .",
    "the algorithm is summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : iter ] .",
    "standard theory of josephson junctions  @xcite predicts the phase variation of the current in the weak - coupling limit to be @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the phase difference across the barrier , and",
    "@xmath0 is the temperature - dependent critical current .",
    "such a current variation arises from consideration of two superconductors with different phases being coupled by a single energy - independent transmission coefficient , corresponding to the tunneling of cooper pairs across a barrier .",
    "a more general consideration  @xcite includes the bogoliubov - de gennes equations for a one - dimensional system of two superconductors coupled across a potential barrier , @xmath149 .",

    "so if the barrier is parameterized by a single scattering potential , then the linear response supercurrent only depends on the normal state conductance according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : linearphase ] ) and the product of @xmath165 is a constant , independent of the microscopic details of the barrier .",
    "more realistic treatments of the barrier region are expected to result in deviations from eq .",

    "further differences arise between methods which treat the barrier as a single scattering potential and our self - consistent treatment of the order parameter and off - diagonal green s functions within the barrier .",
    "our results indicate that the effective scattering strength of the barrier , @xmath166 , changes with temperature and current flow . in general , the proximity effect , which enhances coupling between superconductors ,",

    "to begin , we demonstrate how our model reproduces standard results , by using the hartree - fock approximation to calculate the self energy within the barrier region . as such",
    ", we are effectively self - consistently solving the full bogoliubov - de gennes equations for the system . in all the results that we present in this paper , the superconducting region",
    "is modeled with an attractive hubbard interaction of @xmath168 at half filling .",
    "the homogeneous bulk superconductor then has a critical temperature , @xmath169 and a zero temperature order parameter , @xmath170 .",
    "we begin by solving for systems with a small attractive interaction within the barrier , @xmath171 , over a range of barrier thicknesses .",
    "this attraction is small enough that the bulk superconducting transition temperature of the barrier material is always less than any temperature we consider .",

    "[ fig : thopb ] indicates that the system with a smaller hopping integral in the barrier , @xmath184 , has a larger anomalous average than the uniform system ( with @xmath182 ) , due to its increase in density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "as the temperature is increased , there is a crossover , with the system that has largest hopping integral in the barrier ( @xmath185 ) , having the largest anomalous average just below the critical temperature , @xmath27 .",
    "such a crossover is due to the differing natural energy scales , @xmath180 , in the barrier region .",
    "for the system with @xmath184 , an actual temperature of @xmath186 corresponds to a temperature of @xmath187 in the natural energy units of the barrier , @xmath180 . when the temperatures are given in units of @xmath180 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thopb2 ] , a series of approximately parallel curves is seen , ordered according to the differing densities of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the anomalous average , @xmath188 , plotted on the @xmath189-axis , does not require such scaling , as it is dimensionless .",
    "it is interesting to observe the density of states , in particular the presence of states within the gap as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ldos](a ) .",
    "the two major peaks correspond to andreev bound states , which carry current , when there is a phase difference across the barrier region .",
    "the bound states can be seen to split in two , so that two inner peaks move towards each other , while two outer peaks move to the gap edge as the current flow increases . a careful examination of the curve corresponding to zero current reveals a great deal of structure , due to states trapped within the barrier region .",
    "the exact energies of the bound states depend on the width of the barrier , and the states arise in part from normal reflection of quasiparticles with non - zero momenta parallel to the planes@xcite .",
    "the intraplanar momenta of the quasiparticles may lead to the states being unobservable as current peaks at the corresponding voltages in an i - v curve , where only quasiparticles travelling perpendicular to the planes are measured . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3dldos ] , we examine the bound states in more detail , for a system with ten barrier planes ( @xmath190 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that as the energy of the states within the gap approaches the gap edge , so they extend further away from the barrier , into the superconducting region [ which begins after the fifth plane from the center ( @xmath191 ) ] .",
    "the figure also demonstrates an alternating parity between states .",
    "the states with energy closest to zero have even parity , as demonstrated by a maximum amplitude at the central planes ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the next higher energy bound states have a node at the central planes , so exhibit odd parity .",

    "[ fig : jdos ] .",
    "it can be seen that the majority of the current is carried by the andreev bound states , and that the two peaks that have separated from a single andreev peak at zero phase difference , carry current in opposite directions .",
    "the states at positive energy carry equal and opposite current to the states at negative energy , but their occupation is much lower for low temperatures , @xmath196 .      by including an extra repulsive or attractive potential on the interfacial planes which connect the barrier to the superconductor , we are able to model in a very simple manner , some of the effects of a charge accumulation region or a schottky barrier . in our simple model",
    "there is a mirror symmetry for a half - filled band : a repulsive potential depletes the electron density in one layer , to reproduce some effects of a schottky barrier , while an attractive potential results in a charge accumulation region .",
    "the effect on the pairing potential and current density are the same , for equivalent potential strengths at half - filling . that is , if a repulsive interfacial potential , @xmath197 , results in a reduction in electron density on a specific plane , then the attractive potential , @xmath198 , at the interface , causes an equal in magnitude increase of electron density at that plane , and results in a system with the same variation in order parameter , and equal current response .",
    "[ fig : mubarr1](a ) indicates the oscillations in the anomalous average resulting from a single layer barrier with @xmath199 and @xmath200 .",
    "notice that the proximity effect is reduced by the additional scattering potential , so the order parameter exhibits variation more like a step - function , with increasing barrier strength .",
    "we can think of the interfacial scattering as modifying the junction from @xmath9 to @xmath8 characteristics .",
    "[ fig : mubarr2 ] depicts the effect on the electron density of a positive interfacial potential , which is like a schottky barrier , since the electronic charge is depleted at the interface .",
    "the charge density also exhibits friedel oscillations away from the barrier .",

    "addition of 10% impurities ( @xmath207 ) leads to a reduction in both current responses to approximately @xmath208 of their initial values , while the anomalous average remains at approximately @xmath209 its original amplitude .",

    "a josephson junction is inhomogeneous in one dimension , so the effects we observe do not violate anderson s theorem .",
    "general considerations of green s functions in a homogeneous system show that increasing the imaginary part of the electronic self - energy ( hence reducing the quasi - particle lifetime ) leads to a reduction in supercurrent for a given phase gradient .",
    "hence it is expected that impurities would have a more deleterious effect on current responses than other superconducting properties , which is in the spirit of anderson s theorem .",
    "we look at the linear response current , @xmath163 , as a function of temperature for a barrier with impurity scattering , in fig .",
