    "in recent years , the rapid improvement of high - contrast imaging instrumentation and techniques have led to the discovery of a number of wide sub - stellar companions to nearby young stars , down to planetary mass .",
    "several of these discoveries , such as ab pic  b , hn  peg  b @xcite , 1rxs j1609  b @xcite , hip 78530  b @xcite and the recently discovered hd  106906  b @xcite and roxs  42b  b @xcite , have mass ratios with respect to their parent stars of only @xmath2 and seriously challenge the current planet formation paradigm .",
    "in particular , their large separations are hard to explain and suggest they might be extreme outcomes of their underlying formation mechanism , regardless of whether it is based on core accretion or disk instability .",
    "our previous survey of 91 stars in the usco region @xcite implies a frequency of wide companion for such regions of 4 - 5% , in agreement with other studies @xcite . this suggests a frequency of wide companions in star forming regions comparable to the values for young moving groups or the field , reported for example by .",
    "most recently we also confirmed three new companions with masses of @xmath3 and separations of @xmath4 in the scorpius - centaurus ( sco - cen ) region @xcite .",
    "these companions represent an interesting intermediate between stellar companions and the @xmath5 ones described above in the upper scorpius ( usco ) region .",
    "the existence of such a seemingly continuous population might imply that binary formation extends all the way down to planetary masses for wide separations , or at least that mass alone is not a clear - cut diagnostic for distinguishing between formation mechanisms . in order to further address these issues",
    ", we conducted a survey of 74 stars in the taurus star forming region with altair / niri @xcite .",
    "the results of the full survey will be presented in a dedicated paper ( daemgen et al .",
    "2014 , apj submitted ) .",
    "here we present the discovery of a @xmath0 companion at a projected separation of @xmath6  au from the f8 star hd  284149 .",
    "a dedicated analysis of the host properties is also presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : host ] , addressing the question of its questionable taurus membership .",
    "hd284149 was observed during six epochs between october 2011 and march 2014 on gemini north with the adaptive - optics assisted niri instrument ( hodapp et al .",
    "2003 ) in j , h , and ks - band . the f/32 camera provided a sampling of 21.9  mas / pixel and a field of view ( fov ) of 22@xmath722 .",
    "total integration times varied between 9sec ( j ) and @xmath87sec ( ks ) and were taken as a series of coadds in a 5-point dither pattern to increase dynamic range and allow sky subtraction .",
    "the details of the observing times for each epoch , together with the mean airmass and seeing at each observing date are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : comp_char ] .",
    "after subtraction of a striping pattern frequently observed in niri images , all images were flat fielded , bad pixel corrected , and sky subtracted .",
    "the field distortion was corrected as described in @xcite who determine a residual astrometric uncertainty of 15mas , 25mas , and 50mas at radii 4 ,  8 ,  and  12  from the center , respectively .",
    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : cpm ] shows one of the fully reduced images of hd284149 and its companion obtained with niri in 2012b .",
    "the achieved full width at half maximum of the point spread function is 008 , and the companion , at a separation of @xmath9 is detected at @xmath1014@xmath11 .",
    "as part of our survey for faint companions in taurus ( daemgen et al .",
    "2014 , subm . )",
    ", we also obtained deep exposures of hd284149 in h and j band , which confirm the presence of the companion with high s / n @xmath12 200 .",
    "these observations , however , saturate the central star and render the relative astrometry and photometry less precise than in the lower - s / n images analyzed here , and are not further used .",
    "[ fig : cpm ]",
    "hd 284149 was included among the members of taurus - auriga association by , but it is not considered in the compilations by @xcite and @xcite . therefore , a re - assessment of the stellar properties is needed .",
    "hd 284149 was classified as f8 by @xcite and g1 by .",
    "a young age of the star is supported by the large lithium ew , the large x - ray luminosity as revealed by rosat , the photometric variability and fast rotation ( a period of 1.079 days is reported by * ? ? ?",
    "the short - term rv monitoring by @xcite was able to exclude the possibility of a tidally - locked binary .",
    "however with a 3 km / s difference between mean rv from and @xcite being about 3 km / s , a binarity with periods of months or years can not be excluded    from the g1-f8 spectral classification , an effective temperature of 5970 - 6100 k is derived following @xcite .",
    "photometric colors are broadly consistent with such temperatures , with a detailed comparison hampered by obervational scatter ( e.g. peak - to valley differences larger than 0.2 mag in v band ) , possibly linked to the photometric variability of the star . adopting the v magnitude from asas ( @xmath13 ) , the @xmath14 color is 1.55 mag .",
    "comparison with the pre - main sequence ( pre - ms ) intrinsic colors of young stars by @xcite suggests a reddening e(b - v ) of about 0.05 - 0.08 mag for a g1 and f8 star , respectively .",
    "slightly smaller amounts of reddening are indicated by the b - v and v - i colors .",
    "such amount of reddening is not unexpected at the distance of the star .",
    "the trigonometric parallax from is @xmath15 mas .",
    "a comparison with members of young moving groups ( mgs ) ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : age ] ) indicates that the lithium equivalent width of hd 284149 is comparable with that of members of @xmath16 pic , tuc - hor , columba and carina moving groups of similar temperatures , and clearly above that of pleiades open cluster and ab dor moving group .",
    "a similar result is obtained for a comparison of the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath17 for hd 284149 ) .",
    "the position of hd 284149 on an hr diagram ( see right panel of fig .  [ fig : age ] ) is close to the 25 myr isochrone using the theoretical models by @xcite , with ages between 15 to 100 myr also compatible with the data .",
    "this isochronal age is on average older than that obtained by other authors because of the revision in the trigonometric parallax , with respect to the value reported in the hipparcos catalogue @xcite .    the resulting kinematic parameters , adopting the parallax and proper motion and the mean of the rvs obtained by and @xcite , are @xmath18  km / s , @xmath19  km / s and @xmath20  km / s .",
    "this is similar to that of the octans association discussed in @xcite , whose proposed members are however all very far from hd 284149 on the sky .",
    "recently @xcite identified an additional group of young stars with similar kinematics to the octans association but with a smaller distance from the sun and a different sky distribution , labeled as octans - near .",
    "while the link between octans and octans - near groups and the existence of the latter as a true moving group deserves further investigation , we note that one of the octans - near proposed members , hip 19496 , is separated on the sky by about 5 deg from hd 284189 , it has a comparable distance ( 98 vs 108 pc ) , and the space velocities of the two stars differ by just 2.7 km / s .",
    "@xcite estimate an age of 30 myr for hip 19496 , similar to our determination for hd 284189 .    in summary ,",
    "hd 284149 is significantly older than the bulk of the taurus - auriga association .",
    "membership is still possible in case of earlier start of star formation in the outer regions of the association @xcite . independently of the tau - aur membership ,",
    "the li ew well above the pleiades locus coupled with the position on hr diagram above zams and other age diagnostics indicate an age of about 25  myr , with minimum and maximum values of about 15 and 50  myr respectively . a summary of the stellar parameters is given in table  [ tab : properties ] .        .",

    "the group of objects with separation @xmath22 and mass ratio @xmath23 seems to be well separated from the one including companions with larger separation and mass ratio , suggesting that different formation mechanisms could be at play .",
    "the small mass ratio of the first group might suggest planet - like formation , but objects with similar mass - ratios at larger separations are difficult to explain .",
    "hd 284149b shows very similar properties to objects like roxs 42bb or ab pic b which , as suggested by @xcite , places it between the bona - fide planets and the lowest mass brown dwarfs imaged so far . together with these and other companions of similar mass and separation , such as hn  peg  b and hd  106906 , hd  284149b represents a challenge for our understanding of the formation of low - mass companions at very wide separations .",
    "the high mass ratio of these systems might suggest a planet - like origin , but at the same time , their estimated mass is well above the deuterium burning limit , suggesting a stellar - like formation .",
    "finally , the findings of dedicated rv campains around young stars seem to suggest a paucity of close - in planetary companions around these targets . only few close in companions",
    "have been detected around young early - g and f - type stars , such as hd 70573 @xcite and hd 113337 .",
    "their small number seem to imply a lower frequency of such companions if compared to the more massive , more distant ones as hd 284149b .",
    "if confirmed , this could suggest that multiple planet formation mechanisms are at play around these objects .",
