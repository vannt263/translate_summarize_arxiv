    "nowadays large programs of experimental study of processes with polarized particles are in progress . the setups with deuteron targets ( beams )",
    "occupy the leading place @xcite . for an investigation of the @xmath8 interaction in the deuteron at short distances the three deuteron form factors , magnetic , electric and quadrupole , should be determined . in the elastic @xmath9-scattering with unpolarized particles one can measure only two quantities , e.g. the magnetic form factor and the deuteron function @xmath10 , which is a kinematical combination of all three form factors .",
    "even these two quantities provide important information about the quark physics and dynamics at short distances ( see , for instance recent measurements @xcite at tjnaf ) .",
    "however , for a full determination of the deuteron form factors , one needs measurements with polarized particles .",
    "for example , measurements of the tensor analysing power @xmath11 of recoil deuterons in elastic @xmath9-scattering allow the determination of the charge form factor @xmath12 at high transferred momenta .",
    "the hadron - deuteron processes can be considered as complementary tools in investigation of phenomena at short distances and also as a source of unique information unavailable in electromagnetic reactions ( study of nucleon resonances , checking the non relativistic effective models , @xmath8 potentials etc . ) .",
    "experimental and theoretical investigation of the proton - deuteron processes at intermediate and high energies has started some decades ago by studying elastic @xmath13 scattering  @xcite , exclusive and inclusive break - up  @xcite . in @xmath13",
    "processes it is possible to completely restore the reaction amplitude by measuring a full set of polarization observables ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "hence , as in the electromagnetic case one needs to measure different polarizations of the recoil deuteron .",
    "since polarization observables can be studied only by an additional secondary scattering of the reaction products ( in polarimeter ) , it is obvious that second process must possess a high enough cross section to assure a good efficiency of the polarimeter . in ref .",
    "@xcite bugg and wilkin have proposed as an effective deuteron polarimeter the process @xmath14 where the final @xmath1-pair is detected with extremely low excitation energy ( see also ref .",
    "later investigations @xcite confirmed the theoretical predictions and the charge exchange processes were suggested also for use in investigation of a number of reactions with deuterons , e.g. @xmath15 @xcite , @xmath16-systems , inelastic @xmath17-reactions off heavy nuclei to study isoscalar transitions @xmath18 @xcite etc .",
    "the direct consequence of these facts is that nowadays the interest in investigation of charge exchange processes does not abate . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we investigated the process @xmath0 within the impulse approximation .",
    "the goal of the present work is to consider theoretically the effects of the final state interaction in this reaction at relativistic initial energies ( cosy , dubna ) and to confess whether in this case the non relativistic predictions  @xcite hold and the reaction can be still regarded as a deuteron polarimeter tool .",
    "we propose a covariant generalization of the spectator mechanism  @xcite based on the bethe - salpeter formalism and on numerical solution of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation with a realistic one - boson exchange kernel  @xcite . here",
    "we focus our attention in calculations of the cross section and the tensor analysing power @xmath11 within the cosy kinematical conditions at , as in non relativistic case , zero vector analyzing powers of the deuteron .",
    "we select those processes which , in the deuteron center of mass system , correspond to final states with one fast neutron and a slowly moving proton - proton pair , i.e. reactions of the type @xmath19 the transferred momentum from the proton to the neutron is low , hence the main mechanism of the reaction can be described as a charge exchange process of the incoming proton off the internal neutron whereas the proton in the deuteron remains merely as a spectator .",
    "if so , then the resulting @xmath1-pair will be detected with low total and relative momenta . in fig .",
    "[ pict1 ] the diagram of such processes is schematically depicted .",
    "the following notations are adopted : @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the 4-momenta of the incoming proton and outgoing neutron , @xmath22 is the total 4-momentum of the @xmath1-pair , which is a sum of the corresponding 4-momenta of detected protons , @xmath23 , @xmath24 : @xmath25 .",
    "the notion of the invariant mass of the pair @xmath26 , where @xmath27 stands for the nucleon mass and @xmath28 for the excitation energy of the pair , is also explored in what follows .",
    "the excitation energy @xmath28 ranges from zero to few @xmath29 , @xmath30 . at such low values of @xmath28",
    "the main contribution to the final state of the @xmath1 pair in the continuum comes from the the @xmath2-configuration  @xcite .",
    "the differential cross section for the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) reads @xcite : @xmath31 the experimental data from saclay @xcite are binned into the following intervals of excitation energy : @xmath32 to compare the cross section ( [ cross3 ] ) with the experimental data it is necessary to integrate over the invariant mass of the pair in the regions @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 according to @xmath36 by using the mandelstam technique @xcite the covariant matrix element corresponding to the diagram on fig .",
    "[ pict1 ] can be written in the form @xmath37 the elementary charge - exchange amplitude @xmath38 is incorporated in the matrix element ( [ fin ] ) by the on - shell amplitudes @xmath39 and the dirac spinors .",
    "in doing so the off - shell effects are neglected and the elementary subprocess is considered as real process with on - shell particles . in our numerical calculations",
    "we use the helicity amplitudes of pn scattering , resulting from both the nijmegen partial wave analysis @xcite and the well - known results of said @xcite .",
    "for the final @xmath2-state within the @xmath40-classification the bs amplitude @xmath41 in the center of mass of the @xmath8 pair is represented by four partial amplitudes @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 @xcite , which for the sake of brevity are denoted as @xmath46 .",
    "the partial amplitudes @xmath47 may be found from the bs equation , which , in the simplest case of pseudo scalar exchanges reads as @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the scalar and spinor propagators , respectively , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the free amplitude corresponding to two non interacting nucleons ( the relativistic plane wave ) .",
    "the solution of eq .",
    "( [ neodn ] ) may be presented as a neuman - like series , the first term of which is the free term from eq .",
    "( [ neodn ] ) : @xmath53 the second part in eq . (",
    "[ rash ] ) is entirely determined by the interaction and may be symbolically referred to as scattered wave . to determine the scattered wave in eq .",
    "( [ rash ] ) it is necessary to solve the bs equation of the type ( [ neodn ] ) .",
    "solving the bs equation in the continuum is a much more cumbersome procedure than , e.g. for the homogenous equation . besides difficulties encountered in solving the latter ( singularities of amplitudes , poles in propagators , cuts etc . )",
    "the former even does not allow the wick rotation @xcite to the euclidian space , and in the minkowsky space there are no rigourous mathematical methods of finding solutions .",
    "however , an approximate solution of eq .",
    "( [ neodn ] ) may be obtained by applying the so - called `` one - iteration approximation '' @xcite . within that one",
    "may obtain a rather good estimate of the interaction term .",
    "for a consistent relativistic analysis of the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) one should solve the bs equation for both bound state and scattering state with the same interaction kernel .",
    "we have found a numerical solution for the deuteron bound state with a realistic one - boson exchange potential @xcite .",
    "the bete - salpeter equation , after a partial decomposition , has been solved numerically by using an iteration method .",
    "we found that the iteration procedure converges rather quickly if the trial function is properly chosen .",
    "in such case even after the first iteration the bs solution coincides with the exact one up to relative momentum @xmath54 .",
    "this circumstance becomes useful if one needs an approximate solution of the bs equation at not too large momenta @xmath55 .",
    "this is just our case , since in reaction ( [ reaction ] ) the relative momentum of the @xmath1-pair is expected to be rather small and the scattering part of the amplitude ( [ rash ] ) can be obtained from the equation ( [ neodn ] ) by one iteration . to solve eq .",
    "( [ neodn ] ) we proceed as follows ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) : i ) for simplicity , in the inhomogeneous bs equation we leave only the pseudo scalar isovector exchanges ( @xmath56-mesons ) ii ) by disregarding the dependence upon @xmath57 in the meson propagator in eq .",
    "( [ neodn ] ) and then using the standard representation of propagators via generalized legandre polynomials @xmath58 , one obtains for the main partial amplitude @xmath59   u_{^1\\!s_0}(s_f,|\\bp'| ) , \\label{before_int}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 . in obtaining ( [ before_int ] ) the integration over @xmath61",
    "has been carried out in the residium @xmath62 and , by definition , the bs wave function in the continuum is @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the vertex function ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "now if we restrict ourself to only one iteration in ( [ before_int ] ) and take the trial function ( [ u_contin ] ) as a non relativistic solution of the schrdinger equation , e.g. the paris wave function @xmath65 , the bs amplitude is obtained by formula @xmath66 where the `` one - iteration '' bs vertex @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68 \\int\\limits_0^\\infty dr\\ , e^{-\\mu r}j_0(pr)\\,u^{nr}_{^1\\!s_0}(r ) + \\right .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left .\\frac{|\\bp|}{m e_p } \\int\\limits_0^\\infty dr\\ , \\frac{u^{nr}_{^1\\!s_0}(r)}{r}\\,e^{-\\mu r}\\,(1-\\mu r)\\,j_1(pr ) \\right\\}. \\label{fin_oi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now from eqs .",
    "( [ foi ] ) and ( [ fin_oi ] ) one may easily find the non relativistic analogue of the obtained formulae .",
    "so , the free term in eq .",
    "( [ foi ] ) together with the first term in eq .",
    "( [ fin_oi ] ) reflect the non relativistic equation for the @xmath2 wave function , while the second term in ( [ fin_oi ] ) turns out to be corrections of pure relativistic origin .",
    "in figs .  [ pict7 ] and [ pict8 ] we present the results of numerical calculations of the cross section @xmath69 and tensor analysing power @xmath11 .",
    "the elementary charge exchange amplitude has been taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and the non relativistic trial function @xmath70 is the solution of the schrdinger equation with the paris potential  @xcite .",
    "the bethe - salpeter amplitudes are those from the numerical solution @xcite obtained with a realistic one - boson exchange interaction . the dashed lines in figs .",
    "[ pict7 ] and [ pict8 ] correspond to results within the relativistic impulse approximation @xcite , while the solid lines denote results with taking into account the final state interaction in one - iteration approximation ( as it is described above ) .",
    "it is seen that in all three energy bins the agreement with data for the cross section is essentially improved .",
    "especially it concerns the range @xmath71 . for the energy bin close to zero",
    "there is still a disagreement with data at low transferred momenta which , probably may be addressed to the fact that in our calculations we have not taken into account the coulomb interaction in the @xmath1-pair . for higher excitation energies ( @xmath72 ) , other partial waves ( e.g. triplet state ) in the @xmath1-final state contribute and , within the adopted assumptions one may expect only qualitative agreement with data . from the fig .",
    "[ pict7 ] one may conclude that at low excitation energies the supposed mechanism for the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) ( charge exchange subprocess with interaction in @xmath2 state of the @xmath1-pair in the continuum ) seems to be correct .",
    "moreover , from a comparison of the left and right panels in fig .",
    "[ pict7 ] one may expect that for the higher initial energy there is larger kinematical region where the mechanism holds . figure [ pict8 ] demonstrates that the tensor analysing power is less sensitive to final state interaction effects . as a matter of fact",
    ", the tensor analysing power , being a ratio of non diagonal products of partial amplitudes to the diagonal ones , serves as a measure of the quality of parametrization of partial amplitudes and their mutual relative phases .",
    "this has been pointed out in a series of publications ( see e.g. refs.@xcite ) , where a good simultaneous description of cross sections and @xmath11 in reactions of the deuteron break - up or elastic scattering from protons , is still lucking .",
    "nevertheless , since in the process ( [ reaction ] ) the behaviour of the partial amplitudes is mostly governed by the elementary charge exchange ones , an experimental investigation of the tensor analysing power @xmath11 in reactions of the type ( [ reaction ] ) can essentially supplement data on the @xmath8 charge exchange amplitudes at high energies . in figs .",
    "[ pict9 ] and [ pict10 ] we present the predicted cross section and tensor analysing power at high energies ( cosy , dubna ) .",
    "it is immediately seen that the cross section is substantially decreasing with the energy increasing , nevertheless remains large enough to be experimentally investigated .",
    "another peculiarity of the studied process at relativistic energies is that the tensor analysing power @xmath11 does not change the sign remaining positive in a large kinematical region , in contrast to the lower energies ( cf .",
    "[ pict8 ] ) . note again , that in the above calculations the vector analyzing power of the deuteron is strictly zero .    from the performed analysis",
    "one can conclude that there is a kinematical region for the excitation energy , @xmath73 , and transferred momentum , @xmath74 ( the cosy  @xcite kinematics ) , for which the mechanism of the reaction ( [ reaction ] ) is fairly well described within the spectator approach by an elementary @xmath75 charge exchange subprocess , for active nucleons , with detection of the @xmath1-pair in the @xmath2 final state .",
    "our covariant approach agrees with previous non relativistic calculations and allows predictions of the cross sections and polarization observables at intermediate and relativistic energies , in particular , for kinematical conditions achievable at cosy . the predicted cross sections and tensor analysing power @xmath11 are large enough for the process ( [ reaction ] ) to be used , in a large range of initial energies , for the determination of properties of polarized deuteron , provided experimentally one simultaneously detects vanishing vector polarization of deuterons .",
    "in summary , the performed covariant analysis of the reactions @xmath76 with two protons in the @xmath2 final state allows to conclude that , as in the non relativistic limit , such process can be used as an effective deuteron polarimeter also at relativistic energies , achieved at cosy and dubna .",
    "the effects of final state interaction are found to be substantial and essentially improve the agreement with data .",
