    "the ability to accurately model plasmas in non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) is essential in understanding complex phenomena associated with atomic population kinetics , thermal equilibration and radiation transport .",
    "@xcite collisional - radiative ( cr ) models are the most common numerical tool used in simulating non - lte plasmas ; these models are adapted to a wide range of applications ranging from low temperature plasmas to high energy density physics .",
    "there have been continuous improvements from theoretical calculations of atomic data and cross sections @xcite , to computational models of time - accurate collisional - radiative kinetics for different plasma regimes@xcite .",
    "detailed cr models , however , are very computationally intensive due to the enormous amount of atomic data and elementary cross sections involved in the simulation . therefore these models are traditionally applicable to problems with low dimensionality or used as a post - processing tool for diagnostics .",
    "recently , multi - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations with cr kinetics have become feasible for moderate size kinetic systems thanks to the recent advances in high performance computing@xcite .",
    "in addition , many coarse - graining techniques have been developed to further reduce the computational cost associated with modeling the cr kinetics.@xcite    an important issue that must be addressed carefully in the cr modeling process is the treatment of non - thermal populations , e.g. , hot electrons from laser produced plasmas or electrons emitted from cathode in a discharge system .",
    "a proper treatment of these systems requires solving the kinetic equation for the translational degree of freedom of the particles .",
    "the two most common approaches for these types of problem are the `` two - term '' approximation@xcite and monte carlo collision method .",
    "@xcite these methods however are quite expensive for detailed cr modeling with many atomic states . in previous work@xcite",
    ", we propose an alternative approach , which is to use the classical multifluid approximation @xcite , in which non - thermal populations can be treated as separated fluids with their mean velocities and temperatures .",
    "the focus of this work is to extend the applicability of the cr models to the multifluid regime . due to the assumption of individual maxwellians , the relative drift velocity between two different fluids , if significant , can impact the kinetics of the collisions .",
    "our previous work focuses on the modeling of excitation / deexcitation collisions using the multifluid description .",
    "@xcite the significance of the relative drift velocity on the kinetics , hereby referred to as the multifluid effect , is characterized by a nondimensional parameter @xmath0 , which is defined as the ratio of the kinetic versus thermal energies computed using the reduced mass and relative ( hydrodynamic ) velocities of the two colliding particles .",
    "we note that this effect had also been examined by different authors.@xcite in 1969 , burgers presented a framework for deriving exchange source terms for a system of moment equations .",
    "@xcite although most of his results are for a five - moment system , the framework is rather generic and can be readily applied to other moment systems .",
    "horwitz and banks derived the momentum and energy exchange rates for charge exchange collisions including the multifluid effect .",
    "@xcite in their model , deviation from single - fluid results is characterized by a parameter @xmath1 , which is essentially the square root of the parameter @xmath0 defined in our work .",
    "conde et al . studied the friction forces due to coulomb collision for drifting ions in a partially ionized plasma .",
    "@xcite barakat and schunk @xcite derived momentum and energy exchange rates for elastic collisions using various forms of elastic cross sections , e.g. , inverse - power interaction , hard sphere and maxwell molecules .",
    "anisotropic effects are also considered in their work .",
    "we remark that all the work described above do not include inelastic and/or reactive collisions .",
    "these collisions are briefly considered in burgers using a simple bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) operator .",
    "@xcite a more general model for a reactive collision can be found from the work of benilov @xcite , where the derivation is based on consideration of a general two - body collision of the form @xmath2 . due to the general description of the collision , the exchange source terms are quite complicated making numerical implementation very challenging .",
    "this paper presents a continuation of our previous work @xcite to the case of ionization and three - body recombination collisions .",
    "the modeling of these collisions is more complicated than excitation / deexcitation collisions because they involve more than two particles . using the mulitifluid approximation , each participating particle ( electron , neutral , ion )",
    "can be characterized as a fluid with its own set of conservation laws . in the most general case",
    ", one can have four different fluids associated with the scattered particle @xmath3 , the target particle @xmath4 , its ionized state @xmath5 and the free electron @xmath6 .",
    "fortunately , as will be shown , simplifications can be made for the special case of electron induced ionization and recombination , which is of particular interest for most applications .",
    "the derivation presented in this work follows naturally from our previous work .",
    "some slight modifications are introduced to avoid complication in mathematical notations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "[ sec : transfer ] describes the kinematics of the collision .",
    "the exchange rates for ionization and recombination collisions are considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : ion ] and [ sec : rec ] respectively . for ionization collisions , we first formulate the exchange terms for the general case , and then perform a systematic reduction to obtain a set of rate equations applicable for the case of electron induced collisions . for recombination collisions , we only consider the case of electron induced recombination using the same reduction technique . utilizing these rates ,",
    "we describe in sec . [",
    "sec : cr ] how to construct a cr model within the multifluid equations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] , we show the numerical evaluation of the rates , and present zero dimensional calculations to demonstrate the impact of the multifluid effect .",
    "finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "several appendices are also provided to elaborate on the derivation of the exchange rates .",
    "let us consider an inelastic collision between two particles @xmath3 ( scattered ) and @xmath4 ( target ) , the result of which leads to an ionization of @xmath4 into its ionized stage @xmath5 and creation of a new electron @xmath6 .",
    "the reverse process is a three body recombination collision which involves three particles @xmath3 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "both of these processes can be represented by the following reaction : @xmath7 in the case of an ionization collision , the subscript @xmath8 denotes pre - collision variables and both subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote post - collision variables . for recombination , we have the reverse order where the subscripts @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote pre - collision and @xmath8 denotes post - collision .",
    "these notations are slightly different than the one used in excitation / deexcitation @xcite , but they will prove convenient later in defining the rate coefficients .",
    "the species names @xmath11 also indicate the _ fluid _ to which the particles belong , hence in the general case we have four different fluids . for @xmath12",
    ", we have an electron induced ionization / recombination .",
    "conservations of mass , momentum and energy are expressed as :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the ionization energy of the target particle .",
    "let us define the following center - of - mass ( com ) and relative velocities for the particles both in the left and right hand side of ( [ eq : rxn ] ) : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "one can easily verify that the both transformations are unitary , i.e. @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the inverse transformation can be easily found from ( [ eq : transformation ] ) , leading to : @xmath19 we can apply the same transformation to the bulk hydrodynamic velocities : @xmath20 using the com and relative velocity variables defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : transformation ] ) , conservations of momentum and energy can be expressed as :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "note that conservation of momentum implies that the com velocity is essentially unchanged after the collision so for simplicity , we can take @xmath24 .",
    "furthermore , let us define @xmath25 to be the energy transferred during the collision : @xmath26 the last expression is obtained from energy conservation .",
    "for the case of ionization / recombination , @xmath27 $ ] where @xmath28 is the available kinetic energy in the com reference frame .",
    "let us now look at an ionization collision which can be decomposed into a two - step process :    [ eq : ti1 ] @xmath29    where the first step is the formation of a _ virtual _ excited state @xmath30 via scattering and the the second step is a spontaneous ionization of @xmath30 .",
    "the decomposition of ( [ eq : ti1 ] ) is used only for the convenience in expressing the exchange variables .",
    "we can write a transfer integral expressing the rate of change of any moment variable @xmath31 as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the ionization differential cross section .",
    "note that @xmath35 includes a product of two maxwellian vdf s @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "utilizing the same procedure described in appendix b of le & cambier@xcite for excitation / deexcitation , @xmath35 can be written in the following form : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the differential cross section ( dcs ) expressed in terms of relative velocities .",
    "the average quantities used in the transformation are summarized in table [ tab : ion ] .",
    "note that these variables are defined only for ionization .",
    "for recombination , we have a different set of average variables . table [ tab : ion ] also shows the approximation of these average variables for the case of an electron induced ionization by making use of the small mass ratio @xmath40 , and further assuming that @xmath41 .",
    "the latter assumption is almost always true for most of the practical cases , especially for electron induced collisions with heavy atoms . for brevity , the boltzmann constant",

    "case i , shown in solid lines , corresponds to an initial zero relative drift velocity ( @xmath42 ) and case ii , shown in dashed lines , to a large initial relative drift velocity ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "similar to the observation made when considering excitation / deexcitation only , the kinetics of inelastic collisions is enhanced when the relative drift between the two fluids is significant .",
    "this is indicated by an early increase in the population of the excitation states from figure [ fig : ntevol_56 ] . moreover , the temperature relaxation between two cases are also different as can be seen from the bottom plot of figure [ fig : ntevol_56 ] .",
    "we remark that in this test case , the enhancement to the kinetics due to the relative drift only persists on the momentum relaxation time scale .    ) and temperatures for the two test cases with initial conditions from table [ tab : ic ] .",
    "solid lines denote case i with @xmath44 initially and dashed lines denote case ii with @xmath43 initially .",
    "the evolution of the equivalent drift temperature @xmath45 ( red ) is shown for case ii .",
    "for case i , @xmath46 , which corresponds to a single - fluid calculation . ]    to further examine the relaxation process in the presence of the multifluid effect , figure [ fig : rt6 ] shows the time evolution of the boltzmann temperatures of the excited states and the energy exchange rates due to different types of collision for case ii .",
    "the boltzmann temperatures , defined between two adjacent states @xmath47 and @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , are as follows : @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 are the number densities of levels @xmath47 , @xmath48 . these temperatures are used to measure deviation from the boltzmann equilibrium of the atomic states .",
    "it can be seen from the top of figure [ fig : rt6 ] that at approximately @xmath53 sec , all the higher states ( @xmath54 ) have reached equilibrium with the free electrons .",
    "due to the large energy gaps between the first 3 atomic states , these states take a longer time to equilibrate , e.g. , @xmath55 at approximately @xmath56 sec .",
    "this condition is known as partial local thermodynamic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "although not shown in here , the system eventually achieves complete thermodynamic equilibrium at a much later time .",
    "the energy exchange rates of the electrons are shown in the bottom plot of figure [ fig : rt6 ] .",
    "the solid lines denote thermal relaxation ( terms proportional to @xmath57 ) , the dashed lines denote frictional work ( terms proportional to @xmath58 ) , and the dotted lines denote heat of formation due to inelastic collisions ( terms proportional to @xmath59 ) . in general , these terms can have different signs where positive and negative mean heating and cooling respectively . for this particular case ,",
    "the electrons are losing energy due excitation / ionization and thermal relaxation with the heavy particles ; therefore , the solid and the dotted lines indicate cooling rates . on the other hand , the friction between the electrons and heavy particles can do work to heat the electrons ,",
    "so the dashed lines here refer to heating rates .",
    "one can see from the bottom plot of figure [ fig : rt6 ] that up to @xmath60 sec , frictional heating and heat of formation are the two main energy transfer mechanisms .",
    "this also corresponds to the momentum relaxation time scale , after which the momentum of the electrons have been completely absorbed by the heavy particles , signalling a change to single - fluid kinetics .",
    "one can also note that during @xmath61 , there are competing effects between all the processes , and inelastic collisions in general can also contribute to total energy exchange and should not be neglected .",
    "although this test case suggests that the multifluid effect only persists on the momentum relaxation time scale , we expect that this effect becomes more significant for system where there exists a steady state current ( since the the drift is always maintained due to the current ) .",

    "we have presented a model for ionization and recombination collisions in a multifluid plasma . the model is rigorously derived from kinetic theory and follows directly from our previous work on the modeling of excitation and deexcitation collisions@xcite .",
    "the derived exchange coefficients are shown to have proper asymptotic limits , and satisfy the principle of detailed balance . using the new set of rate coefficients ,",
    "we have developed and tested a new multifluid collisional - radiative model for atomic hydrogen with semi - classical cross sections for all the elementary processes .",
    "this model has two important features : ( a ) multifluid effect is captured in the definitions of the rate , and ( b ) the momentum and energy exchanges due to inelastic collisions are included .",
    "numerical calculations of the exchange rates are carried out and the accuracy is confirmed with direct monte carlo integration .",
    "the results indicate that in the presence of a relative drift between two reactant fluids , the rates can be significantly different than the single - fluid limit .",
    "two numerical tests are conducted demonstrate the capability of the new model . in the first test ,",
    "we compare the steady - state solutions of the collisional - radiative rate equations with constant @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath0 .",
    "the results converge to the single - fluid solution as @xmath64 , and can deviate from that when @xmath65 . in the second test , an isochoric heating of a partially ionized hydrogen plasma is performed in a virtual test cell to demonstrate the coupling between various collision processes .",
    "we observe that in general inelastic collisions can participate in the overall energy exchange process and should be included in the model .",
    "the present work can be extended to other types of collision , e.g. , charge exchange and molecular collisions , with slight modifications .",
    "future work focuses on examining the nonlinear coupling of transport with collisional - radiative kinetics by means of the multifluid transport equations @xcite .",

    "j. marshall ) and 14rq13cor ( pm : m. birkan ) .",
    "similarly to excitation , the ionization process has two particles in the initial istate , but the final state includes a third particle , since an electron extracted from the target to yield an ion state ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "the process is therefore : @xmath67 in the case of ionization , one must integrate over the distribution functions of the initial variables , which remain @xmath68 , and the procedure used in an excitation collision remains valid .",
    "however , for recombination , we have a triple product of vdfs : @xmath69\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the argument of the exponential function is : @xmath70 where @xmath71 . in order to perform the separation of variables , it is necessary to proceed in two steps .",
    "thus , we can consider the ionization process as follows :    1 .   the formation of an excited state @xmath30 via scattering : @xmath72 2 .",
    "the spontaneous ionization of the @xmath30 state into ion and electron : @xmath73    the reverse process , recombination , would similarly follow two steps :    1 .   the formation of an excited state @xmath30 via recombination : @xmath74 2 .   the spontaneous deexcitation of the @xmath30 state via scattering : @xmath75    consider now the first part of this two - step recombination process , which involves the product of the two vdfs for electron and ion : @xmath76 .",
    "the argument of the exponential function resulting from this product is @xmath77 as defined in ( [ eq : aeis ] ) .",
    "let us first perform the separation of variables for the product @xmath78 ( see appendix b of le & cambier @xcite ) , such that the argument becomes : @xmath79 where    @xmath80    and the relative velocity @xmath81 is defined according to ( [ eq : transformation ] ) .",
    "we can now multiply by the vdf for the scattering particle for the second step of the recombination process .",
    "this leads to the total argument : @xmath82 let us also define @xmath83 with @xmath84 .",
    "this yields : @xmath85 and , from ( [ eq : ct ] ) , @xmath86 inserting into ( [ eq : e13 ] ) : @xmath87 { \\ensuremath{\\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{g}}}}}}_2 ^ 2\\\\               & + 2\\gamma_t(\\beta_e\\!+\\beta_i){\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}}^*\\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{g}}}}}}_2   + 2\\beta_s { \\ensuremath{\\mathbf{v}}}^*\\cdot { \\ensuremath{\\tilde{{\\ensuremath{\\mathbf{g}}}}}}_1 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
