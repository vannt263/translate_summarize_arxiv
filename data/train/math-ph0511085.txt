    "it s always surprising how far one good idea can go . and while we re here celebrating the 100th birthday of the photon , i would like to add one more fillip on that good idea .",
    "this time verging into almost pure mathematics ; the photon leads us to a new way of characterizing curves and to a novel integral invariant over curves .    in classical radiation theory",
    "practically all there is to calculate is the energy radiated ; or perhaps occasionally a frequency spectrum or a polarization . but with the advent of the photon there is a new quantity in the radiation field : just the plain number of photons .",
    "this is an ordinary real number , evidently dimensionsless . and independent of the lorentz frame ; while changing your velocity can change the energy of a photon , it ca nt change one photon into two photons . if it is well - defined there ought to be some nice simple formula for it . `` but aha '' , you will say , `` that s just the trouble , it s not well defined .",
    "there s the notorious infra - red catastrophe , where as we all know , the number of photons radiated is infinite  even while the radiated energy remains finite . ''    correct .",
    "but nevertheless , as i was surprised to realize , there is a general class of situations where the infra - red catastrophe is averted .",
    "let @xmath0 be the number of photons radiated by a charge following some given trajectory .",
    "let the initial and final velocities be exactly the same  let us `` identify '' them",
    ". in this case can in fact be finite .",
    "this is because in a scattering process the infra - red catastrophe arises from the infinite flight paths for the incoming and outgoing particle , as the infinite range field is shaken off or re - constituted . or in terms of fourier transforms , zero frequency results from infinite time .",
    "when the re - constituting is not necessary because the infinite paths are identical , or when the infinite times do nt occur , the number of photons can be finite .",
    "naturally the exact , perfect , identity of initial and final velocities will never occur in reality .",
    "but we can still imagine the idealized case and ask ourselves what the nice simple formula looks like .",
    "it looks like this @xcite :    @xmath1    in the first writing @xmath2 is the four - distance between the points @xmath3 in the following way : @xmath4 .",
    "this formula follows from taking the text book formula for the energy radiated at frequency @xmath5 and dividing by @xmath5 to get ( planck ) .",
    "this is the only place where quantum mechanics enters .",
    "the @xmath6 arises in making sure the resulting integral is defined , but we get rid of it in the second writing by some manipulations which lead to the factor 2 and the `` transverse tangent '' expression in the last writing .",
    "the `` transverse tangent '' means to take the tangent vector @xmath7 and to remove the component of it along the vector @xmath8 connecting the two points @xmath9 .",
    "this construction cleverly avoids the threatened singularity as @xmath10 , since as two points approach each other along a curve the tangents point at each other and @xmath11 .",
    "the result refers of course to the average number of photons since the number fluctuates  is not an integer .",
    "such a formula for @xmath0 is quite amusing since it means that any curve satisfying the `` identification '' requirement has a real number belonging to it ",
    "its own `` name '' .",
    "this is a simple number , an invariant , intrinsic property of the curve .",
    "the `` identification '' requirement is nt really very restrictive since the curve can do almost anything it wants before it finally goes back out to infinity parallel ( in the four - dimensional sense ) to the direction it came in .",
    "`` almost '' because to avoid that other lurking danger , the ultra - violet divergence , the curve must be smooth and not have any kinks or jumps .",
    "one may verify that eq  [ one ] leads to the correct result for dipole radiation and yields the usual association between acceleration and radiation .",
    "in minkowski space then , we have a nice way of associating a number to a curve .",
    "we may now even forget photons and physics for a moment and wonder if this applies to ordinary curves , plain garden - variety curves in euclidean space . indeed ,",
    "if we take the last form in eq  [ one ] as our starting point , there appears to be nothing against this .",
    "the argument that the transverse tangent construction is finite as @xmath12 still holds .",
    "so we write    @xmath13    and is still an invariant dimensionless quantity , an intrinsic property of the c  basically characterizing its `` wiggliness '' .",
    "we must of course retain our requirement concerning the infra - red problem .",
    "as the curve goes to @xmath14 it has the same tangent  becomes the same straight line ( remember that in four - space the tangent was the velocity ) . but otherwise , as long as it is smooth , the an do anything on its way from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "we have dropped the @xmath17 since we are now only interested in the purely mathematical structure , but have kept the ( - ) sign since this makes things come out positive .",
    "fig 1 shows an example , with evaluated according to eq  [ two ] . according to a little fortran program ,",
    "the number for this curve is 38.8 .",
    "playing with the end points indicates that the number has essentially gone asymptotic in the picture . for the straight line eq  [ two ] gives of course zero .",
    "furthermore , in euclidean space a new opportunity presents itself : the possibility of closed curves . in minkowski space",
    "a curve could not go `` backwards '' since it could not have a tangent @xmath18 , outside the light cone .",
    "but now with no light cone to cross , there is no reason not to consider closed curves .",
    "furthermore , note that for a closed curve the `` beginning '' and `` end '' of a are the same , so the identity of initial and final tangents is automatic .",
    "if all this is true then what is the number of that most basic of closed s , the circle ? it is : @xmath19 as just follows from integrating eq  [ two ] directly .",
    "the value is of course a result of the normalization we chose for our integral , but once we have chosen it , it is the same for all circles , big ones and small ones ; depends only the shape of the curve .",
    "in addition , we also might have the strong suspicion that among all plane curves the circle has the smallest .",
    "i believe this is indeed true and hope to present a proof shortly . to exemplify this , here",
    "s a little table for the ellipse with different eccentricities @xmath20 .",
    "the first entry , for the circle , is close to @xmath21 , and as would be expected , the more eccentric the ellipse the larger .    .numerical evaluation of eq  [ two ] for ellipses of increasing eccentricity . [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "given a curve , what other curves have the same ?",
    "we might suspect , because of the dimensionless character of eq  [ two ] , that in addition to the usual invariances under translation , rotation and so forth , that is conformally invariant  @xcite .",
    "the essential part of conformal invariance is the inversion @xmath22 .",
    "the inversion carries closed curves into closed curves except when the center of inversion is on the curve itself , in which case the circle , for example , becomes the straight line going to infinity .",
    "it then turns out that eq  [ two ] is invariant under inversions , except for these exceptional cases . in the exceptional cases one",
    "must universally add @xmath23 .",
    "this is just right to get eq  [ circle ] when inverting the straight line , for which is zero , to a circle .",
    "the fact that this extra addition is universal in this case is the same for any closed curve  is suggestive @xcite of the `` anomaly '' .",
    "that is we have symmetry breaking , here for the inversion but in a universal manner .",
    "the analysis of this situation leads to the study of a quantity called @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 has the same value for all curves of a given class , of which there are four , and represents a novel kind of integral invariant ."
