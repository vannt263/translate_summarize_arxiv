    "since the early 1980s calculations and measurements on the optical properties of ultra - small particles have seen important progress @xcite .",
    "coming from the angstrom end of the size spectrum we see an equally profound development in the field of clusters and the region where the two meet is especially interesting [ 3 - 5].underlying this development are of course both the advance in computational tools @xcite as well as increasingly refined experimental techniques . especially methods which make it possible to produce and study individual particles of a well - defined shape and size underpin the rapid development of the field [ 7 - 10 ] . at the same time the possible applications of plasmonic resonances in these systems , ranging from medical therapies , via biosensing to new devices are but a few examples of what is driving the field rapidly forward [ 11 - 14 ] . despite the positive development described above there are still crucial aspects of plasmonic resonances in small particles that are not completely understood and hence not utilized to their full potential . in a recent paper @xcite we presented a theoretical model for analyzing the size dependence of the surface plasmon resonance of metallic nanospheres in a range of sizes down to a few nanometers . within this model",
    ", we explicitly showed how different microscopic mechanisms affect the energy of the surface plasmon in quantitative agreement with recent published experimental results for ag and au .    in this article",
    "we address a question related to the one considered in @xcite .",
    "we investigate the behavior of the width of the surface plasmon resonance as a function of the size of the particle and the influence of its surrounding medium , because the understanding of the plasmon decay rate is essential to control its spectral response . whereas the energy shift is small compared to the peak position in an absorption spectrum of a small particle ,",
    "the width is a much more sensitive parameter to what takes place inside and around the particle .",
    "mechanisms affecting the width include shape changes , vibrations in the particle ( with electron - phonon coupling dependent on particle geometry @xcite ) and scattering processes of the conduction electrons common to bulk materials ( electron - electron and electron - defect scattering ) .",
    "chemical effects associated with the bonding of adsorbed molecules from a reactive host matrix to the particle surface @xcite or the presence of ligand molecules also contribute to the plasmon width .",
    "radiation damping is not significant for the very small particles we consider in our paper .",
    "however , of major concern for us is another damping mechanism , the so called surface scattering related to the non - harmonic part of the surface potential where for a perfect harmonic confining potential there is no associated damping but now the direct excitation of electron - hole pairs in an electronically very inhomogeneous region of space ( known as spill - out region ) plays a major role as we will show below .",
    "a basic question to address in this context is to what extent is the collective mode broadening an intrinsic or extrinsic property of the small particle .",
    "this is an essential issue because it limits the electromagnetic field enhancement at its surface .",
    "we calculate the optical extinction cross - section of ag spheres of nanometric size embedded in different host media , characterized by their permittivity @xmath1 , assumed to be frequency independent .",
    "we take a top - down approach to the nanoparticles and , starting from a large size , make them smaller and smaller",
    ". for metal spheres less than 25 nm in diameter , the wavelengths of interest are typically much larger than the size so that a quasi - static dipolar approximation is valid to calculate the optical properties . within this approximation , the surface scattering mechanism for the damping of the surface plasmons is introduced in the theory using the framework presented in @xcite , which includes non - local surface screening and size quantization effects , and was used to reproduce the lspr shift in frequency .",
    "the surface scattering mechanism gives a surface plasmon linewidth which depends on size and also on the permittivity of the surrounding medium . in ag",
    ", this width reaches a maximum as a function of the host permittivity , independently of size .",
    "we also analyze the quality factor of the surface plasmon resonance of these ag spheres .",
    "we find that , when surface scattering is the dominant mechanism for the damping of the surface plasmon , the quality factor shows a trend with size different than when radiative damping dominates .",
    "our study is motivated by recent quantitative experimental determination of the size dependence of the surface plasmon resonance in single ag nanoparticles coated with sio@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in previous experiments @xcite , the samples contained ensembles of particles with a dispersion in size which made a detailed investigation of this issue difficult .",
    "the remarkable agreement we find between the experimental and our calculated plasmon widths affirms our approach .",

    "( 6a ) and ( 6b ) show that this classical theory produces resonances which are independent of particle size in the quasistatic approximation .",
    "however , it is well known experimentally that the frequency and width of the surface plasmons are size - dependent for particles of radii which , in principle , are within the quasistatic regime . in particular",

    "a surface contribution to the relaxation time of the form expressed by the second term on the right hand side of the preceeding equation has been computed by several authors using the so - called quantum - box model , in which the electronic states are quantized in an infinite barrier potential at the surface of the particle [ 23 - 26 ] . in this paper",
    "we introduce the surface scattering mechanism for plasmon damping using the theory presented in @xcite . in this framework , non - local , dynamical effects occurring at the surface of the metal particle , where electrons spill - out , are incorporated in the theory by means of the complex length @xmath30 , defined as @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the induced electronic density , @xmath33 is the radial coordinate and the integrals extend to the whole space .",
    "the real part of @xmath30 is related to the position of the center of gravity of the screening charge density at the surface and produces red / blue shifts of the surface plasmon frequency of spheres depending on whether the screening charge sits outside / inside the jellium edge .",

    "the fact that @xmath34 $ ] is finite at the frequency of the surface plasmon indicates that this collective excitation has a finite lifetime because it is coupled and decays into the incoherent excitation of electron - hole pairs ( landau damping ) .",
    "these surface effects can be incorporated into the polarizability of small spheres , yielding the generalization of the classical eq .",
    "( [ mie - polarizability ] ) as @xcite @xmath35    in the classical mie theory , where the charge density is proportional to @xmath36 , @xmath30 is zero and these surface effects are absent . in our approach",
    "( [ epsilon - w ] ) is generalized in order to include quantum size effects as @xmath37 with @xmath38 playing the role of an energy gap introduced by the quantization of the electronic levels of the nanoparticle .",
    "we should point out that the results we are going to present below are very little influenced by the effects of quantization due to size .",
    "this is because , as discussed in @xcite , quantum size effects are only important for spheres smaller than about 5 nm in diameter , while the experimental widths we will compare to are measured in spheres of diameter on the order of and larger than 10 nm .    the surface contribution to the absorption cross section can be analyzed in a simple way by assuming that @xmath12 is real , which is a good approximation for ag in the range of frequencies of interest below the onset for interband transitions ( less than 4 ev ) where @xmath39 \\gg \\mathrm{{im}}[\\epsilon_d(\\omega)]$ ] and @xmath40 .",

    "we compare our results with a recent experimental determination of the surface plasmon resonance damping of single ag spheres coated with sio@xmath6 , finding a good agreement in the range of sizes @xmath107 nm where the dipolar approximation is valid .",
    "we thus conclude that our approach to surface plasmons in small particles is a reliable one down to 10 nm in diameter , a range of sizes where sophisticated first principles calculations are not feasible yet . however , these kinds of calculations are necessary when decreasing the particle size below 5 nm , where quantum size effects play an important role in accounting for the color of the energy shift of the surface plasmons and should be equally important for a determination of their widths",

    "<S> nanometer - sized metal particles exhibit broadening of the localized surface plasmon resonance ( lspr ) in comparison to its value predicted by the classical mie theory . using our model for the lspr dependence on non - local surface screening and size quantization </S>",
    "<S> , we quantitatively relate the observed plasmon width to the nanoparticle radius @xmath0 and the permittivity of the surrounding medium @xmath1 . for ag nanospheres larger than 8 nm only the non - local dynamical effects occurring at the surface are important and , up to a diameter of 25 nm , dominate over the bulk scattering mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively , the lspr width is inversely proportional to the particle size and has a nonmonotonic dependence on the permittivity of the host medium , exhibiting for ag a maximum at @xmath2 . </S>",
