    "the recently discovered superconductor mgb@xmath0 has attracted a lot of attention , because of its unexpectedly high critical temperature , @xmath3 , for a phonon - mediated pairing mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that such a high @xmath3 is due to the existence of two superconducting gaps  @xcite , with this claim supported by experiments  @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the two gaps open on different parts of the fermi surface  @xcite .",
    "one part is three - dimensional , and arises from the @xmath6 bonding and antibonding orbitals ; it gives rise to the smaller gap with @xmath7 .",
    "the second part consists of nearly cylindrical sheets , which arise from the @xmath8-band , and gives rise to the larger gap with @xmath9 .",
    "the anisotropy of the superconducting gaps and that of the fermi surface should lead to an anisotropic upper critical field , @xmath10 , and this has indeed been reported in mgb@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropy is temperature dependent , the ratio of @xmath10 in the boron plane to that along the @xmath11-axis being about 3 near @xmath3 and about 7 at low temperature .",
    "an empirical two - band model based on the presence of two different gaps was successfully used to fit specific - heat data obtained on different mgb@xmath0 samples in zero field  @xcite . in this model , each gap is assumed to follow the usual temperature dependence of the bcs theory , whereas the gap ratio @xmath12 is allowed to differ from the bcs value 3.5 .",
    "both gaps are expected to be sensitive to impurity scattering  @xcite .",
    "an interesting prediction is that non - magnetic interband scattering will decrease @xmath3   in the case of two coupled gaps , whereas anderson s theorem would rather predict that scattering is irrelevant to first order for a single gap  @xcite . in the limit of strong scattering",
    ", it has been predicted that both gaps will be averaged up to the point where the single gap bcs limit is recovered .",
    "this should occur for @xmath3  @xmath13k  @xcite .",
    "this motivated the present study where the behavior of both gaps is followed by bulk specific - heat experiments while disorder is introduced in the material .",
    "we report heat capacity measurements on a polycrystalline sample before and after irradiation by fast neutrons .",
    "we found some suppression of the larger gap after irradiation , whereas the smaller gap remains quite robust .",
    "finally , the normal - state resistivity and the irreversibility field of mgb@xmath0 were reported to be enhanced by proton irradiation  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that neutron irradiation can increase the upper critical field of this material  @xcite . here",
    "we show that the upper critical field of our sample increases from about 18 to 28  t after irradiation . compared to the results obtained on thin films by oxygen post - annealing  @xcite or fast quenching  @xcite techniques",
    ", the specificity of this study lies in the use of a bulk determination , in addition to magnetotransport measurements performed up to 28  t in a bitter - type magnet .",
    "the polycrystalline sample ( hp14 ) was synthesized from mg ( 99.8% ) and b ( 99.7% ) powders at 900@xmath14c for 1 hour in a cubic press at 3 gpa .",
    "[ acdcsus](a ) shows the diamagnetic transition of the pristine sample as detected by @xmath15 susceptibility at 8 khz and 0.1 g. the midpoint of the transition is @xmath16k .",
    "neutron irradiation was subsequently performed at the triga research reactor in vienna .",
    "the sample was irradiated to a fast neutron fluence ( e@xmath170.1 mev ) of @xmath18 m@xmath19 , and in a second irradiation step a fluence of @xmath20 m@xmath19 was added .",
    "neutrons induce defects in mgb@xmath0   mainly by neutron capture of @xmath21b followed by the emission of an alpha particle  @xcite . due to the very small penetration range of low energy neutrons in mgb@xmath0",
    ", thermal neutrons would induce damage only at the surface of the sample , resulting in a highly inhomogeneous defect structure . in order to avoid this problem ,",
    "a cadmium shield was used , which absorbs nearly all low energy neutrons .",
    "the introduced disorder can be estimated to @xmath22 and @xmath23 dpa ( displacements per atom ) after the first and the second irradiation , respectively .",
    "the transition temperature was measured after each irradiation by @xmath15 susceptibility as shown in fig .",
    "[ acdcsus ] .",
    "after irradiation , @xmath3  shifted to lower temperature , 34.6  k after the first and 30.2  k after the second irradiation , and the transition broadened , but remained reasonably sharp compared to the result of similar studies  @xcite .",
    "therefore the disorder introduced by neutron irradiation is fairly homogeneous .",
    "the specific heat was measured before and after each irradiation in the temperature range 2  50 k by two different techniques .",
    "a relaxation calorimeter was used from 2 to 16 k  @xcite , and an adiabatic technique from 16 to 50 k  @xcite .",
    "the resistivity of the sample was measured by the four - probe method .",
    "data at fields below 17 t were obtained in a superconducting magnet by using a @xmath24 current reversal technique , with a current of 2  ma .",
    "additional measurements from 12 to 28 t were performed in a bitter coil at the ghmfl in grenoble using an @xmath15 synchronous detection technique .",
    "these measurements were performed with a current of 2  ma at 11.7  hz .",
    "the specific heat of the sample was measured before and after each irradiation in different magnetic fields .",
    "[ sppic ] shows the specific heat difference @xmath25/t$ ] .",
    "the baseline @xmath26(14 t ) represents the normal state specific heat in the temperature range shown in fig .",
    "[ sppic ] ; it was smoothed before subtraction . since the lattice contribution cancels after subtraction , fig .",
    "[ sppic ] in fact shows the difference between the electronic specific heat in the superconducting and the normal state .",
    "the amplitude of the specific - heat jump in zero field decreases after each irradiation .",
    "its position is shifted in bulk by the magnetic field to a lower temperature .",
    "the broadening of the transition in increasing fields results from angular averaging since our sample is polycrystalline and anisotropic . in mgb@xmath0 ,",
    "the anisotropy of the @xmath10 is estimated as 2  3 close to @xmath3  @xcite . because of the transition broadening due to anisotropy , the onset of the specific - heat anomaly ( see arrows in fig .  [ sppic ] ) was used to define @xmath3 .",
    "this would correspond to the transition temperature of a single crystal for @xmath27 parallel to the boron planes . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the critical temperature is 37.4 k , 35.8 k and 31.2 k for the sample before , after the first and after the second irradiation respectively .",
    "[ hctc ] shows the temperature dependence of @xmath10 obtained from both specific - heat and resistance measurements ( before and after irradiation ) .",
    "note that the determinations based on the specific - heat jump are no longer significant at high fields owing to the smearing of the jump .",
    "nevertheless , they unambiguously demonstrate that the average initial slope @xmath29 increases after each irradiation .",
    "a positive curvature ( pc ) of @xmath10  near @xmath3  can been seen in fig .",
    "[ hctc ] at different stages of irradiation .",
    "this can be attributed to the existence of two superconducting gaps in the sample , which may be considered as a particular case of gap anisotropy  @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out by theory  @xcite that the pc disappears in the  dirty \" limit , where very strong interband scattering suppresses the anisotropy . in order to investigate the change of pc after irradiation , we used the following formula to fit our data near @xmath3  up to 4 - 5 t : @xmath30  @xcite , where @xmath3  is the transition temperature at zero field , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are fitting parameter .",
    "we found @xmath32 within the range of @xmath33 before and after each irradiation , and no significant trend was observed .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that both gaps can still be identified after irradiation , confirming that the interband scattering caused by disorder in this sample is not strong enough to reach the  dirty \" limit , as discussed in section 3.2 .    in order to verify the increase of @xmath10 after irradiation , we performed resistance measurements in magnetic field up to 17  t on the pristine sample and up to 28  t after the second irradiation .",
    "the insets of fig .",
    "[ hctc ] show typical field and temperature sweeps after the second irradiation . for the pristine sample , @xmath10(0 )",
    "is estimated to be about 18 t , in agreement with the results obtained on single crystals for the field parallel to the boron plane  @xcite .",
    "after the second irradiation , the transition becomes broader at low temperature , as it was already the case for the pristine sample , presumably again as a consequence of anisotropy  @xcite . at @xmath34",
    "k , the transition is not complete even at 28 t , indicating @xmath10(0 ) higher than 28 t. both specific - heat onsets and resistance transition midpoints are plotted in the @xmath35 phase diagram of fig .",
    "the results of both determinations of @xmath36 agree reasonably well in the low field range , the onset of calorimetric transitions appearing as an upper limit as expected .",
    "the quasi - linear increase of @xmath37 down to @xmath38 differs remarkably from the horizontal slope at @xmath39 found for conventional superconductors .",
    "an explanation for this unusual behavior was provided within the two band model  @xcite .",
    "note that a similar pc was found in several borocabides  @xcite , not necessarily implying the same physical origin  @xcite .    for a type - ii superconductor in the dirty limit , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the sommerfeld coefficient in the normal state , and",
    "@xmath42 is the normal - state resistivity at low temperature  @xcite .",
    "after irradiation , @xmath3  decreases by 20@xmath43 , so that the main parameters to be investigated for changes are @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "as will be shown later , @xmath41 does not change significantly .",
    "the residual resistivity depends sensitively on disorder . before irradiation , just above @xmath3 , @xmath44 and the residual resistance ratio is @xmath45 . to estimate the electronic mean free path , we use the following formula :    @xmath46 ^ 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sigma}{\\gamma_n v_{\\rm f}},\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 is the normal - state conductivity and @xmath47 is the fermi velocity . with @xmath48mj",
    "/ k@xmath49@xmath50  @xcite and @xmath51cm / s  @xcite , this yields @xmath52 .",
    "since @xmath53  @xcite , the sample is initially rather in the clean limit .",
    "after the second irradiation , the low - temperature resistivity increases to @xmath54(rrr = 1.4 ) , which gives @xmath55 .",
    "the sample is now in the intermediate case between the clean and dirty limit . in the dirty limit , the upper critical field",
    "would be determined by the geometrical average between the coherence length and the mean free path @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , at least qualitatively , one is led to conclude that disorder induced by irradiation affects @xmath10  through the reduction of the mean free path .",
    "however , we note that the sample approaches the dirty limit only after the irradiation , so that the discussion given here remains essentially qualitative .",
    "moreover , the two - band nature of mgb@xmath0 complicates the determination of the mean free path  @xcite .",
    "[ lowtsp ] shows the specific heat below 16 k in different magnetic fields at different stages of irradiation . at the highest field accessible to our measurements ,",
    "@xmath57 t , @xmath58 reflects nearly the normal - state specific heat . at first view",
    ", this would not seem to be the case , since @xmath59@xmath10(0 )  is 18 and 28 t before and after the second irradiation , respectively .",
    "however , it was shown by several experiments that @xmath60 versus @xmath27 already saturates at about @xmath10/2 in polycrystals  @xcite , so that no significant change is expected above 14 t. this is also illustrated by the behavior of the pristine sample ( see fig .",
    "[ lowtsp](a ) ) , where specific heat saturates near 8 t. in the inset of fig .",
    "[ lowtsp ] , we show that the low temperature specific heat at 14  t remains unchanged at different stages of the irradiation , indicating that the normal state sommerfeld coefficient does not change ( the downturn that occurs at very low temperature in the @xmath58 versus @xmath61 plot in the inset of fig .  [ lowtsp ] is believed to be due to the presence of residual magnetic impurities ) .",
    "therefore , as already mentioned above , the variation of @xmath10 is not due to a change in @xmath41 .",
    "we thus conclude that irradiation merely enhances the scattering , causing both a decrease of @xmath3   and an increase of the upper critical field .",
    "these results suggest that other methods able to introduce disorder , such as fast quenching or chemical doping , could also serve to increase @xmath10 , as was realized in a15 compounds  @xcite .",
    "indeed , a large increase of @xmath10  was obtained by metallurgical heat treatment of mgb@xmath0  thin films  @xcite .",
    "the present study shows that this increase of @xmath10 is a bulk property , at least at low fields , where the specific - heat jump is clearly observable .",
    "it is confirmed by direct resistance measurements at low temperatures and high magnetic fields , rather than by extrapolation beyond 10 t in previous work .      as discussed above , irradiation does not reduce the density of states , but merely increases the scattering . for",
    "a one - band , isotropic superconductor , scattering due to non - magnetic impurities would account for the increase of the normal - state resistivity , but would not affect @xmath3 to first order . for a two - band superconductor , @xmath62band scattering would preserve the two - gap structure even for a high concentration of impurities  @xcite . in the present case ,",
    "a clear suppression of @xmath3 is observed ; it can only be explained by @xmath63band scattering between the @xmath8- and @xmath6- bands  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a distinction should be made between samples for which impurities affect only the normal - state resistivity , leaving @xmath3 unchanged  @xcite , and the present irradiated samples , for which both @xmath3 and resistivity are affected .",
    "these distinct situations reflect different balances between intra- and interband scattering .",
    "if we believe that strong interband scattering exists for the present samples , which is rather unusual for mgb@xmath0  @xcite , we expect changes in the two - gap structure after strong irradiation .",
    "we proceed to study this point experimentally .",
    "the electronic specific heat @xmath64 versus @xmath65 at zero field is plotted in fig .",
    "[ shof2gaps ] . the lattice contribution determined at 14",
    "t was smoothed and subtracted . the low temperature excess of the specific heat with respect to a one - gap bcs curve ( hatched area in fig .",
    "[ shof2gaps ] ) , which results from the existence of the smaller gap  @xcite , becomes less pronounced after irradiation .",
    "a satisfactory fit can be obtained for the unirradiated sample using a two - gap model  @xcite .",
    "the fit gives @xmath66 mev for the larger gap and 2.1 mev for the smaller gap , with nearly equal weights .",
    "similar fits can be made after irradiation .",
    "the gap values at each stage of irradiation are given in table  [ tabl1 ] .",
    "after the second irradiation , the quality of the fit was degraded by the broadening of the transition .",
    "a satisfactory fit was obtained by shifting @xmath3 slightly above the midpoint of the jump and by lowering @xmath41 by 2.5% .",
    "an obvious effect of the irradiation is the suppression of the larger gap , which , in a two - gap model , is reflected in the specific heat jump at @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this gap , which originates from the 2d @xmath8-band , seems to be more sensitive to defects .",
    "the smaller gap , which is reflected in the low temperature hump in the specific heat near 10  k , appears to be quite robust in absolute value , remaining within 10% of the average 2.15 mev in all cases .",
    "however , its reduced value @xmath12 increases after each irradiation , due to the decrease of @xmath3 .",
    "liu et al . predicted that interband scattering in mgb@xmath0 should average both gaps , which would finally merge into a single bcs gap when @xmath3   reaches @xmath67 k  @xcite .",
    "the observed gap values are plotted as a function of @xmath3 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ shof2gaps ] .",
    "this plot suggests that the single - gap limit will only be reached for @xmath3 smaller than the anticipated 27 k , although additional irradiations will be required to prove it . from the fits",
    ", one can also see that the weight of both gaps remains almost unchanged after the irradiation .",
    "golubov et al . calculated the effect of interband scattering on specific heat due to non - magnetic impurities within the two - band model  @xcite , and pointed out that the impurity scattering should increase the @xmath68 ratio , whereas the specific heat jump @xmath69 should remain nearly constant .",
    "according to our experiment , @xmath69 decreases after irradiation and @xmath68 decreases only slightly .",
    "this disagreement may be of experimental origin and due to the transition broadening .",
    "the coefficient of the mixed - state electronic specific - heat , @xmath70 , provides independent information on both gaps .",
    "its highly non - linear increase is shown by the plot @xmath71 at @xmath72 ( here , 3k ) on a logarithmic field scale ( see fig .",
    "[ gammah ] ) .",
    "the curves at different stages of irradiation lie nearly parallel to each other below 10 t , and saturate at the same value of @xmath73 at 14 t. the small maximum at 8 t for the non - irradiated sample is believed to be an artifact due to a residual schottky contribution of magnetic origin .",
    "the fact that the three curves are parallel to each other implies a simple relation @xmath74 , where @xmath75 after the first irradiation and @xmath76 after the second one .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ gammah ] illustrates this relation : the @xmath58 versus @xmath61 curves at 0.5 t for the pristine sample , 0.84 t after the first irradiation , and 1 t after the second irradiation point to the same value of @xmath77 .",
    "according to theory  @xcite and experiment  @xcite , both gaps have nearly equal weights , i.e. the partial densities of states @xmath78 and @xmath79 of the associated bands , and the partial normal - state sommerfeld coefficients @xmath80 and @xmath81 , are nearly equal .",
    "recent scanning tunneling microscopy measurements on a single crystal show that already in a magnetic field of 0.2 t , there is a significant overlap of vortex cores in the @xmath6-band vortices  @xcite .",
    "very recent specific - heat measurements on a single crystal have revealed that @xmath82 increases very fast with the field , and saturates above a crossover field @xmath83 , whereas @xmath84 saturates at 3.3 t ( field along the @xmath11-axis ) or 18  t ( field in the @xmath85-plane )  @xcite .",
    "it follows that at low fields(@xmath86 t ) the contribution from the smaller gap dominates the behavior of @xmath70 , in agreement with theory  @xcite . on the contrary , at high fields ( @xmath87 t ) ,",
    "the contribution from the smaller gap saturates , so that the variation of @xmath70 comes from the larger gap .",
    "the crossover near 0.4  t can be considered as the virtual upper critical field @xmath88 for the smaller gap .",
    "the parallelism of the curves in fig .",
    "[ gammah ] at high fields ( 1  8 t ) provides the proof for the increase of @xmath10 associated with the larger gap .",
    "this is independently measured by the shift of the specific - heat jump and resistive transitions .",
    "alternatively , at low fields ( @xmath89 t ) , below the saturation of the contribution @xmath82 associated with the smaller gap , one may deduce from the approximate relationship @xmath90 that @xmath88 has increased after irradiation by the same factor @xmath32 as @xmath91 .",
    "this observation tends to support the interpretation that the superconductivity in the @xmath6-band is not independent , but rather induced by superconductivity in the @xmath8-band  @xcite . at this point",
    "we must recall that our sample is a polycrystal , so that information on the anisotropy is lost in the high field region dominated by the large gap of the @xmath8-band .",
    "more detailed information on this unusual system would require irradiation experiments on single crystals .",
    "we studied irradiation effects on a polycrystalline sample of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "irradiation by fast neutrons provides a good tool to introduce @xmath63band scattering .",
    "specific - heat measurements show a suppression of the larger gap after irradiation , whereas the smaller gap @xmath92 remains nearly unchanged . in terms of reduced gap value @xmath93",
    ", the gaps tend to converge , but slower than predicted by considerations of the interband scattering .",
    "the two - gap feature remains quite robust .",
    "we also find that the upper critical or crossover field @xmath94 associated with the smaller gap follows the behavior of that of the larger gap after irradiation .",
    "together with resistivity measurements , we show that a substantial increase of @xmath10@xmath95 can be obtained by irradiation , without sacrificing more than a few degrees in @xmath3 .",
