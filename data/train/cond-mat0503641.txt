    "the recently discovered fermion superfluidity in @xmath1k@xcite and @xmath2li@xcite has attracted much attention .",
    "this is the first system where we can experimentally examine the bcs - bec crossover phenomenon@xcite , originally discussed in the superconductivity literature@xcite .",
    "the novel pairing mechanism of this fermi superfluid is associated with a feshbach resonance@xcite , in which two fermi atoms can form a quasi - molecular ( boson ) state .",
    "the resulting attractive interaction can be tuned by varying the threshold energy ( denoted in this paper by @xmath3 ) of the resonance , using an external magnetic field@xcite .    in fermi superfluids",
    ", there are two distinct kinds of excitations , i.e. , collective modes and single - particle excitations .",
    "two single - particle excitations are created with the breakup of a cooper - pair . even in the bec regime ,",
    "where the character of superfluidity can be best described as the bose condensate of molecules , the single - particle fermi excitations still exist .",
    "this situation quite contrasts to an ordinary bec of bose atoms , where low - energy excitations are all bosonic in nature@xcite . very recently ,",
    "both the single - particle excitations@xcite and collective modes@xcite have been studied experimentally in the crossover region of superfluid @xmath2li .",
    "the frequency of a collective mode is strongly affected when it is near the threshold energy of the two - particle continuum at @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the single - particle excitation gap . in the bcs region of a uniform , neutral fermi superfluid , this can be seen by the suppression of the goldstone mode ( @xmath6 at low @xmath7 ) , when its energy approaches the two - particle continuum value of @xmath8@xcite . here",
    ", @xmath9 is the fermi velocity and @xmath10 is the bcs cooper - pair order parameter . a similar suppression of a collective mode frequency by the single - particle excitations is expected in a trapped fermi superfluid . in this case , we have shown recently@xcite that the single - particle energy gap @xmath5 is _ not _ simply related to the position - dependent order parameter @xmath11 , but is dominated by the lowest energy andreev bound state appearing at the edge of the trapped gas@xcite . even in the crossover region , where the magnitude of the superfluid order parameter in the center of the trap is comparable to the fermi energy @xmath12 , @xmath5 is still the order of the trap frequency @xmath13 ( which is usually much smaller than @xmath12 ) . since the frequencies of the quadrupole and the monopole modes are the order of @xmath13@xcite , they are expected to be strongly affected by the two - particle continuum at @xmath4 .    in this paper , we investigate the collective modes at @xmath0 in the bcs - bec crossover region of a fermi superfluid in a trap .",
    "the theory is precisely the same as in our recent discussion of collective modes in a uniform fermi superfluid@xcite , except that we limit ourselves to @xmath0 .",
    "the present paper makes crucial use of our results@xcite for the single - particle excitations in a trapped fermi gas superfluid . to properly include the effect of the energy gap @xmath5 associated with the andreev bound states , the self - consistent bogoliubov de gennes ( bdg ) coupled equations@xcite were solved numerically .",
    "the strong - coupling effect is taken into account by considering the deviation of the chemical potential @xmath14 from the fermi energy @xmath12 , which is associated with the appearance of the bosonic pair states . as a result",
    ", the bdg equations have to be solved together with the equation of state involving the number of atoms@xcite to take into account the molecule condensation .    in this paper ,",
    "the single - particle solutions of the bdg equations are used in a detailed calculation of the density correlation function , using the time - dependent hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( random phase ) approximation ( hfb - grpa ) .",
    "this includes the coupling between ordinary density fluctuations and fluctuations in the cooper pair - channel . as proven recently@xcite",
    ", this linear response formalism guarantees that goldstone s theorem and kohn s theorem@xcite are satisfied in the entire bcs - bec crossover regime , required for any consistent approximation for collective modes in a fermi superfluid .",
    "our approach is an extension of the weak - coupling bcs theory by bruun@xcite to the strong - coupling regime including a feshbach resonance and the associated molecules . in the crossover region",
    ", we show that the frequencies of the low - energy collective excitations , such as the quadrupole and monopole modes , are strongly suppressed so that they stay below the threshold energy of the two - particle continuum at @xmath4 .",
    "we note that the @xmath0 hydrodynamic superfluid theory@xcite describing pure superfluid dynamics can not , in principle , describe this suppression phenomenon .",
    "this is because such a theory ignores any explicit consideration of single - particle excitations , and in particular the low energy andreev excitations in a trap .",
    "as expected , this suppression effect disappears as one enters the bec region , where the single - particle excitation energy gap becomes very large@xcite .",
    "it is useful to be clear about the relation of our kind of microscopic theory of collective modes and the predictions based on solving the equation of motion of a pure superfluid@xcite .",
    "the latter so - called `` hydrodynamic '' theory is limited to @xmath0 , since it assumes that all the atoms are described by the superfluid component ( i.e. , there is no normal fluid ) . in this theory ,",
    "the only unknown microscopic input is the equilibrium equation of state , giving the chemical potential as a function of the density .",
    "there has been considerable recent progress in determining this equation of state in the bcs - bec crossover regime , including the strong interaction unitarity limit ( @xmath15)@xcite . the advantage of starting from the equation of motion for a pure superfluid is that it is expected to be valid even in the strong interaction limit , and makes no assumption about the amount of depletion of the condensate ( which could be very large in the unitarity limit ) .",
    "the weakness of the @xmath0 superfluid hydrodynamic theory is that , by definition , it can not deal with any questions related to the single - particle excitations , such as the effect of the two - particle continuum or the effect of a normal fluid component ( which would arise at finite temperatures ) .",
    "in contrast , our present microscopic calculations can deal with such effects .",
    "however , they do not include any large depletion of the condensate due to interaction , although the effect of thermal excitations can be treated .",
    "one deficiency of our present calculations might be mentioned at the outset , namely that in the bec limit , our collective modes are predicted to be those of a non - interacting molecular bose condensate .",
    "the explanation of this is simply that in mean - field bcs theory which lies at the core of our present discussion , we do not include the higher order fluctuations which ultimately give rise to the correct @xmath16-wave interaction between molecules @xmath17@xcite , in the bec limit of the crossover . in a separate paper@xcite , we give the appropriate extension which does reproduce the correct value of @xmath18 , which in turn would lead to correct collective mode frequencies in the bec limit@xcite .",
    "however , this deficiency in reproducing the bec collective modes correctly is of minor concern in connection with the major point we emphasize in this paper , namely the suppression of the collective mode frequencies in the bcs - bec crossover region due to coupling to the two - particle continuum .",
    "it should also be emphasized that our microscopic hfb - grpa theory for the collective modes could be used as the starting point to derive the equation of motion for the the dynamics of the superfluid at t = 0 . in the bcs limit of a trapped fermi superfluid ,",
    "for example , such a derivation has been carried out in detail by baranov and petrov@xcite .",
    "the analytic solutions of this t = 0 equation of motion describing the collective modes of a bcs fermi superfluid have been discussed by bruun and clark@xcite .",
