    "the borsuk - ulam is the following theorem in classical topology : if @xmath0 is continuous , then there is some point @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , where @xmath4 is the antipodal point of @xmath5 .",
    "the typical layman s statement of the borsuk - ulam theorem is that there is always a pair of opposite points on the surface of the earth having the same temperature and barometric pressure .",
    "since the theorem first appeared ( proved by borsuk ) in the 1930s , many equivalent formulations , applications , alternate proofs , generalizations , and related ideas have been developed , and active work continues today .",
    "see the nice book @xcite by matouek for a survey .",
    "@xmath6    this paper aims to derive a similar theorem in the context of digital images which are defined by a discrete set of pixels . to get a feel for our aims ,",
    "consider the grayscale digital image pictured in figure [ haystackfig ] , which measures @xmath7 pixels .",
    "the brightness of each pixel varies across the image , so we can consider the brightness as a function @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the set of pixels in the image .",
    "the rectangular boundary @xmath10 of the image is topologically analagous to @xmath11 , and our brightness function naturally restricts to a function @xmath12 .",
    "then the classical borsuk - ulam theorem suggests that , subject to some continuity condition on @xmath13 , there should be a pair of opposite points on the boundary having the same brightness .    for digital images it turns out that we can not in general expect opposite points with exactly the same brightness .",
    "we will revisit the image in figure [ haystackfig ] in section [ exlsection ] after we derive our results .",
    "our approach uses the topological theory of digital images which has been developing since the 1980s .",
    "several different models of `` digital topology '' have been proposed by various authors .",
    "we will use the graph - like theory of digital images and continuous functions based on adjacency relations . see boxer @xcite for a basic reference .",
    "we will review the basic ingredients here .",
    "a _ digital image _ is a pair @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is a set and @xmath16 is a symmetric antireflexive relation on @xmath15 , called the _",
    "adjacency relation_. we sometimes refer elements of @xmath15 as _ pixels _ , and the relation @xmath16 tells us which pixels are adjacent to one another .",
    "when @xmath17 and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related by @xmath16 , we say @xmath18 and @xmath19 are _",
    "@xmath16-adjacent _ , and we write @xmath20 . if the adjacency relation @xmath16 is understood , we simply write @xmath21 . if @xmath21 or @xmath22 , we write @xmath23 .    typically it is assumed that @xmath24 for some @xmath25 , and the adjacency relation @xmath16 is a restriction of some globally defined adjacency relation on @xmath3 .",
    "the most obvious applications occur in the case where @xmath15 is a finite subset of @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the topological theory of digital images has , to a large part , been characterized by taking ideas from classical topology and `` discretizing '' them .",
    "typically @xmath28 is replaced by @xmath29 , and so on .",
    "topology in @xmath30 typically makes use of the standard topology on @xmath30 .",
    "viewing @xmath29 as a digital image , it makes sense to use the following adjacency relation : @xmath31 are called _ @xmath32-adjacent _ if and only if @xmath33 .",
    "this adjacency relation corresponds to connectivity in the standard topology of @xmath28 ( the notation `` @xmath32 '' is explained below ) .",
    "unfortunately there is no canonical `` standard adjacency '' to use in @xmath3 which corresponds naturally to the standard topology of @xmath30 . in the case of @xmath26 , for example , at least two different adjacency relations seem reasonable : we can view @xmath26 as a rectangular lattice connected by the coordinate grid , so that each point is adjacent to 4 neighbors ; or we can additionally allow diagonal adjacencies so that each point is adjacent to 8 neighbors .",
    "this is formalized in the following definition from @xcite ( though these adjacencies had been studied for many years earlier ) :    let @xmath34 be positive integers with @xmath35 .",
    "then define an adjacency relation @xmath36 on @xmath3 as follows : two points @xmath37 are @xmath36-adjacent if their coordinates differ by at most 1 in at most @xmath38 positions , and are equal in all other positions .",
    "thus @xmath39 is the two - dimensional integer lattice described above in which each point has 4 neighbors , and @xmath40 is the variation in which each point has 8 neighbors .",
    "the usual adjacency described above on @xmath29 is simply @xmath32 . in @xmath27",
    "the three relations @xmath41 differ with respect to which kinds of diagonal adjacencies are allowed : @xmath32 allows no diagonal adjacencies , @xmath42 allows `` face diagonals '' across unit squares , while @xmath43 additionally allows `` solid diagonals '' .    in this paper",
    "we focus on these @xmath36 relations .",
    "almost all digital images in this paper will be subsets of @xmath3 for some @xmath25 , with adjacency given by @xmath36 for some @xmath35 .",
    "our results in section [ dim1section ] will hold for more general adjacency relations , and even digital images @xmath15 with no particular embedding in any @xmath3 . without restricting to subsets of @xmath3 ,",
    "the theory of digitial images resembles abstract graph theory ( see @xcite , which never assumes that the images are embedded in @xmath3 ) .",
    "continuity of functions is a basic ingredient in a digital topological theory .",
    "the following definition is equivalent to one posed by rosenfeld in @xcite :    let @xmath14 and @xmath44 be digital images , and let @xmath45 be a function .",
    "we say @xmath13 is _ @xmath46-continuous _ ( or simply _ continuous _ , if the adjacencies are understood ) if @xmath47 implies @xmath48 .",
    "we will also make use of the notion of connectedness .",
    "for @xmath49 and @xmath50 , let @xmath51_\\z$ ] denote the set @xmath52 .",
    "this set is called the _ digital interval _ from @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "given two points @xmath55 , a _",
    "@xmath16-path from @xmath18 to @xmath19 _ is a @xmath56-continuous function @xmath57_\\z \\to x$ ] with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "when the adjacency relation is understood , a @xmath16-path is called simply a _",
    "path_.    a digital image @xmath14 is _ @xmath16-connected _ ( or simply _ connected _ ) when any two points of @xmath15 can be joined by a @xmath16-path .",
    "a subset @xmath60 is a @xmath16-connected component of @xmath15 when it includes all points which can be connected by a @xmath16-path to its elements .    in many papers",
    "the concepts defined above are always prefixed by the word `` digital '' ( e.g. `` digital path '' , `` digitally continuous '' , etc ) .",
    "this is usually unnecessary for us , but we will sometimes use the word for emphasis .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ lipsection ] we develop some necessary terminology and machinery for working with non - continuous functions .",
    "this material is used in section [ dim1section ] to obtain a borsuk - ulam theorem for @xmath29-valued functions on digital images .",
    "our results in section [ dim1section ] generalize results by boxer in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) . in section [ exlsection ]",
    "we demonstrate a specific application to the grainstack image . in section [ higherdimsection ]",
    "we give some partial results and state some open questions for higher dimensional images .",
    "we would like to thank lawrence boxer for several comments and helpful references .",
    "the proof of our borsuk - ulam theorem will require us to consider some functions which are not continuous .",
    "all functions we will consider do , however , have the following weaker property .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath44 be digital images , and let @xmath45 be a function .",
    "we say @xmath13 has _",
    "[ @xmath46]-lipschitz constant _",
    "@xmath62 if @xmath47 implies that there is a @xmath63-path of length @xmath64 from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the terminology is motivated by the classical definiton of the lipschitz constant , which would require that @xmath67 . in our case to avoid assuming a particular metric on @xmath15 we only refer to @xmath16-adjacent points in which case it makes sense to interpret @xmath68 , and the distance from @xmath65 to @xmath66 is interpreted in terms of the length of a @xmath63-path connecting them .",
    "this notion corresponds to a lipschitz condition given by rosenfeld ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) , which assumes that @xmath15 and @xmath69 are metric spaces .",
    "rosenfeld does not explore the idea very much , and we will require a bit more development .    by definition",
    "a function is digitally continuous if and only if it has lipschitz constant 1 .",
    "thus , unlike in classical analysis , the existence of a lipschitz constant does not imply continuity .",
    "in fact in typical cases , any function ( continuous or not ) has a lipschitz constant :    let @xmath70 be any function ( not necessarily continuous ) such that @xmath71 is a finite set contained in a single connected component of @xmath69 . in this case",
    "any two points of @xmath71 are joined by a path in @xmath69 .",
    "since @xmath71 is finite , there must be some maximum length required to realize all of these paths .",
    "let @xmath64 be this maximum , and then @xmath13 has lipshitz constant @xmath64 .    for integer - valued functions @xmath72 , it is easy to see that @xmath13 has lipschitz constant @xmath64 if and only if @xmath73 implies @xmath74 .",
    "lipschitz constants for such functions behave predictably with respect to addition and scalar multiplication :    [ lipaddition ] let @xmath75 have lipschitz constants @xmath64 and @xmath76 respectively , and let @xmath77 . then :    * @xmath78 has lipschitz constant @xmath79 . *",
    "@xmath80 has lipschitz constant @xmath81 .",
    "the proofs are routine .",
    "since continuous functions have lipschitz constant 1 , we have :    [ ctsaddition ] if @xmath82 are continuous , then @xmath83 and @xmath84 each have lipschitz constant 2",
    ".    lipschitz constants also behave predictably with respect to compositions . again",
    "the proof is routine .",
    "if @xmath85 has lipschitz constant @xmath76 and @xmath86 has lipschitz constant @xmath64 , then @xmath87 has lipschitz constant @xmath88 .    since a continuous function",
    "has lipschitz constant 1 , the above gives :    [ lipcomposition ] if @xmath85 is continuous and @xmath86 has lipschitz constant @xmath64 , then @xmath87 has lipschitz constant @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath46-lipschitz constants can be equivalently formulated in terms of continuity with respect to a different adjacency . for a digital image @xmath44 ,",
    "let @xmath89 be the adjacency relation defined by : @xmath18 is @xmath89-adjacent to @xmath19 if and only if there is a @xmath63-path of length @xmath38 from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "this exponentiation operation has the following simple properties :    * @xmath90 * @xmath91    most useful for us will be the following relation between powers of @xmath63 and lipschitz constants .",
    "again we omit the routine proof .",
    "[ powerlip ] let @xmath14 and @xmath44 be digital images , and let @xmath45 be any function .",

    "this proof will require a digital analog of the intermediate value theorem which was proved by rosenfeld in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.1 ) .",
    "after completing our work we learned of the material by boxer in @xcite , which gives a special case of our result in this section .",
    "boxer uses essentially the same ideas , but focuses only on continuous functions ( rather than functions with lipschitz constant @xmath96 ) , and focuses only on the case where the domain is a `` digital simple closed curve '' .",
    "we are grateful to l. boxer for bringing this material to our attention .    the difficulty in adapting the classical proof of the borsuk - ulam theorem to digital images is that , even when @xmath13 is continuous",
    ", the function @xmath97 may not be continuous , and thus rosenfeld s intermediate value theorem does not apply . by corollary [ ctsaddition",
    "] , however , @xmath97 will have lipschitz constant 2 .",
    "thus we will need to generalize rosenfeld s theorem for functions with lipschitz constant greater than 1 .",
    "the theorem below is a direct generalization of the digital intermediate value theorem : when @xmath13 is continuous we have @xmath98 and the conclusion reads @xmath99 .",
