    "a system of neutral mesons such as @xmath7 , @xmath8  or @xmath11 , @xmath12  is a privileged laboratory for the study of weak - interaction s symmetries . even though the phenomenological framework is well understood since long time @xcite",
    ", recent discussions in the physics community @xcite show that it may be useful to revisit a few points , in order to fully ( and correctly ) exploit the experimental results .",
    "this process is then at the origin of the present note .",
    "we focus on the @xmath7@xmath8  system , and refer to experimental results @xcite that have been achieved by measurements of the decay products of @xmath7@xmath8pairs created in the entangled antisymmetric state @xmath13 where the first @xmath0 in this notation moves in direction @xmath14 and the second in direction @xmath15 .    within the weisskopf - wigner approximation @xcite the time evolution of a neutral @xmath0-meson , and its decay into a state @xmath16",
    "is described by the amplitude @xmath17 , @xmath18 where @xmath19  and @xmath20 are represented by constant , complex @xmath21 matrices @xmath22 and  @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",

    "we recall that a symmetry is a property of the hermitian hamiltonian ( @xmath32 ) of the schrdinger equation which is defined in a space sufficiently complete to include all the particle states under consideration , also the decay products @xcite .",
    "thus the aim of the experiments is to establish properties of the weak interaction hamiltonian @xmath33 by measuring observable combinations of the elements of @xmath34 and of @xmath19 , which represent these properties .    as @xmath1 violation implies @xmath2 and/or @xmath3 violation ,",
    "we specifically consider the classical aim posed by the discoverers of @xmath2 violation @xcite `` to express quantitatively the fraction of the observed @xmath1 violation due to @xmath2 violation and @xmath3 violation separately '' .",
    "in passing , we show that a more recent treatment , which attempts to define @xmath2-symmetry violation as `` motion - reversal - symmetry violation '' , without reference to the weak interaction hamiltonian @xcite , is a special case within our phenomenology .",
    "together with a parametrization of the matrices @xmath34 and @xmath19 , the equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are a sufficient basis for the description of the symmetry properties of the experimental results @xcite .",
    "symmetry properties of the hamiltonian often manifest themselves in an especially simple and direct way in relations between measured quantities . here , _ table _ 1",

    "this lets us recognize that , if @xmath51 , our matrix @xmath34 still allows for a finite @xmath47 ( @xmath52 ) , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to widely repeated affirmations @xcite , that @xmath53 would imply time - reversal symmetry of @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath54 .    in terms of @xmath55  ( @xmath56 ,  @xmath57 ) ,",
