    "lamno@xmath0 perovskite - type manganites have been subjected to intense scrutiny due to the existence of highly desired properties such as the observed colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) by either introducing impurities @xcite or applying pressure @xcite .",
    "this effect along with the occurrence of fully spin - polarized conduction bands @xcite makes these materials ideal candidates for the development of spintronic applications @xcite .",
    "lamno@xmath0 exhibits a range of electronic correlation ( i.e. , different strength of the electronic interactions in the system ) as a function of temperature . at low temperature",
    "the system is a mott - hubbard a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - afm ) insulator that crystallizes in the pbnm orthorhombic structure @xcite .",
    "however , at temperatures above t@xmath2 = 750 k the system forms a _ pseudo - cubic _ ferromagnetic ( fm ) metal @xcite where @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattice parameters are nearly equal @xcite .",
    "the transition to this high temperature phase involves a significant reduction of the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions that leads to small decreases of the mno@xmath5 octahedra tilts and rotations @xcite and insulator - to - metal transition ( imt ) . to fully appreciate the mechanism that stabilizes these properties , a complete understanding of the stoichiometric lamno@xmath0 compound",
    "is needed .",
    "an accurate and consistent density functional theory ( dft ) description of the underlying physics requires a procedure that provides a single functional that can be applied to systems with a range of electronic correlation .",
    "this functional must be able to describe the energetics and electronic structure associated with the strength of the electronic correlation for both the imt and the magnetic transition observed at high t. for instance , the development of a dft - based approach with an appropriate amount of non - local hartree - fock exchange ( hfx ) could allow for the direct calculation of the energetics and electronic structure of both high and low temperature phases , including those associated with jt distortions .",
    "hybrid functionals include a hfx treatment of the kohn - sham orbitals that makes them attractive candidates to meet the above requirements .",
    "using the same hybrid functional to simulate the electronic and magnetic states can provide a consistent way for comparing the electronic properties thus , allowing for a consistent interpretation of the mechanism associated with the imt , magnetic and structural phase changes .    in this report",
    "we describe a procedure to determine the necessary amount of hfx mixing contained in a particular hybrid dft functional to capture both the lamno@xmath0 a - afm insulating ground - state and the fm metallic behavior at high t. this type of approach provides a path for studying systems with a range of electronic correlation as a function of experimentally controlled parameters .",
    "this includes bulk systems such as ruthenates and low - dimensional systems such as srtio@xmath0/la@xmath6sr@xmath7mno@xmath0 interfaces , and surfaces .    at low temperature ,",
    "the mno@xmath5 octahedra of lamno@xmath0 are tilted , rotated and distorted by jt instabilities characterized by two short ( @xmath8 = 1.903 ) , two long ( @xmath9 = 2.184 ) , and two medium mn - o bond distances ( @xmath10 = 1.957 ) @xcite .",
    "these instabilities lead to a lifting of the degeneracy of the twofold degenerate e@xmath11 orbital ( singly occupied ) that stabilizes the system into an orbital ordered type insulating state @xcite .",
    "the magnetic phase is a - afm , where mn atoms are coupled ferromagnetically in the @xmath12-plane and antiferromagnetically along the @xmath13-direction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . there are two symmetry - distinct types of oxygen atoms in this structure .",
    "the first type , @xmath14 , lies in the @xmath12-plane and is characterized by one short and one long mn - o bonds .",
    "the second type , @xmath15 , is oriented along the @xmath13-direction and provides two medium size mn - o bonds .",
    "the magnetic ordering of this phase is consistent with the goodenough - kanamori rules @xcite .",
    "these rules are based on the symmetry relations and electron occupancy of the overlapping atomic orbitals .",
    "they predict that the fm ordering observed in the @xmath12-plane are due to the superexchange associated with the mn-@xmath14 bonds and the e@xmath11 partial occupation , while in the @xmath13-direction the isotropic mn-@xmath15 bonds lead to an afm superexchange interaction .",
    "long ( l ) , medium ( m ) , and short ( s ) mn - o bonds as well as the spin ordering are shown.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    upon heating the system above the nel temperature ( 140k ) @xcite , lamno@xmath0 transforms from the a - afm state into a paramagnetic state characterized by time - fluctuating short - range spin ordering between mn atoms @xcite consistent with the curie - weiss law . at t@xmath2 = 750 k",
    "a first order structural phase transition takes place with both an imt @xcite and an orbital order - disorder transition @xcite .",
    "these transitions are driven by the reduction of the cooperative jt distortions @xcite which result in a crystal structure similar to the pbnm crystallographic symmetry but with nearly equal @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattice constants ( referred as _ pseudo - cubic _ ) . moreover ,",
    "the weiss temperature constant becomes positive upon crossing t@xmath2 , thereby indicating the existence of fm interactions in lamno@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "there has been considerable efforts to understand the imt in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "it is known that different types of imt can be driven by different experimentally controlled parameters : pressure , temperature , or doping .",
    "experimental studies carried out using low - temperature raman spectroscopy @xcite and first - principles calculations @xcite demonstrated that high hydrostatic pressure ( @xmath16 32gpa ) reduces the jt distortions , which govern the imt in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "doping lamno@xmath0 with divalent atoms ( sr or ca ) reduces the electron filling in the @xmath17-band and produces mn@xmath18 ions .",
    "this eventually results in a new type of imt @xcite .",
    "in fact , for the limit of complete substitution of la with sr the e@xmath11 orbital is no longer occupied and thus , it is not subjected to jt distortions .",
    "therefore , any variation of these parameters ( t , p , or doping ) can induce dramatic changes in the strong interplay of electron , spin , lattice , and orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the common effect of these interactions is illustrated by the balance between the e@xmath11 orbital degeneracy and the lattice strain energy compensation that results from the reduction of the jt distortions .",
    "this effect is the leading cause for the structural , magnetic , and imt transitions .",
    "however , current understanding of the electronic origins of the imt and the associated high - temperature phase of lamno@xmath0 remains incomplete .",
    "the main difficulty lies in being able to simulate a system containing a range of electronic correlation as a function of experimentally controlled parameters within a single first - principles framework .",
    "one proper way to achieve a satisfactory description would be by the use of a single dft hybrid based functional rather than a collection of _ ad hoc _ parameters that can only account for physical behavior under a given set of external parameters .    here , we demonstrate the existence of a single hybrid dft functional with a particular hfx mixing that accounts for the detailed electronic origins of the structural , magnetic , and imt in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "this approach makes use of local atom - centered basis that provides a natural screening of the hfx potential within a few neighboring shells of atoms .",
    "this important feature results in high computational performance that makes it possible to simulate large systems using hybrid dft functionals .",
    "the numerical efficiency offers a path towards the simulation of low - dimensional systems such as lamno@xmath0 based heterostructures where electronic correlation is known to play an important role on the observed interfacial properties @xcite .",
    "simulations using dft within the semi - local gga have been performed previously .",
    "however , they predicted a metallic fm ground - state instead of the experimentally observed insulating a - afm phase @xcite .",
    "this failure has been attributed to the self - interaction problem plaguing dft .    to accurately describe the properties of lamno@xmath0 phases",
    "requires methods beyond dft , such as the gga+u ( or lda+u ) approach .",
    "this approximation is based on a hubbard - type hamiltonian approach where an on - site constant effective potential is introduced to account for the intra - atomic electron coulomb repulsive potential ( u ) and intra - orbital exchange potential ( j ) @xcite .",
    "the works of hashimoto @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite and mellan @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite confirmed an improvement of the description of the lamno@xmath0 properties by means of an empirical fit of the u and j parameters .",
    "however , this method is truly a local approach for describing strongly correlated systems .",
    "hybrid functionals offer a good alternative to dft and dft+u approximations .",
    "they allow for different amounts of hfx to be mixed with density functional approximations ( dfa ) ( either lda or gga ) exchange potentials .",
    "in general , the hybrid dft exchange - correlation potential can be written as    @xmath21    where _",
    "v@xmath22 _ and _ v@xmath23 _ are the dfa and hf exchange potentials respectively , @xmath24 accounts for the percentage of hfx potential that is mixed with the dft exchange potential , and _",
    "v@xmath25 _ is the dfa correlation potential . unlike gga+u ( lda+u ) ,",
    "hybrid functionals account for both the electronic localization acting on all states of the system in an orbital dependent fashion and the non - local behavior that is not treated within the dft+u on - site approach .",
    "more elaborate hybrid functionals , called range - separated functionals , have provided excellent performance for describing relevant properties of a variety of chemical systems . these functionals make use of a modified form of the coulomb operator separated into long- , medium- , and short - ranges where different percentages of _ v@xmath23 _ and _ v@xmath22 _ apply .",
    "the separation , which is achieved via combination of error ( erf ) and complementary error ( erfc ) functions , is written as    @xmath26    where @xmath27@xmath28 and @xmath27@xmath29 are parameters that define the length scale of separation for the three different regions .",
    "the first two terms represent the short- and long - ranges while the third term represents the middle - range .",
    "there are various types of range - separated hybrid functionals , which depend on the number of regions that are used in splitting the coulomb operator .",
    "for example , the lc-@xmath27pbe @xcite is the long - range separated functional , which uses 100@xmath30 pbe ( gga ) exchange for the short - range component and 100@xmath30 hfx in the long - range part . on",
    "the other hand hse @xcite is a short - range functional since it only contains 25@xmath30 hfx locally , similar to pbe0 ( @xmath24 = 0.25 ) , while it uses 100@xmath30 pbe functional at long - range .",
    "even though both hse and lc-@xmath27pbe perform well for atomic energies , heats of formation @xcite , and magnetic properties @xcite , lc-@xmath27pbe performs badly for bandgaps and hse poorly for reaction barriers .",
    "these shortcomings have lead to the development of a triple range - separated functional known as hiss @xcite . this multi - range separation functional uses 100@xmath30 pbe in the short- and long - range regimes and 60@xmath30 hfx in the middle - range . over a couple of nearest - neighbor distances",
    ", hiss has more non - local hfx than hse but the fraction of hfx in hiss decays more rapidly . since the middle - range separation contains some overlap with both the short- and long - range components and because it contains considerable amount of hfx mixing , this functional usually predicts larger bandgaps and afm - fm energy differences than hse but smaller than lc-@xmath27pbe .",
    "plane - wave based hybrid dft calculations showed that a local mixing of 15@xmath30 hfx in the hse functional reproduces the properties of lamno@xmath0 ground - state @xcite . in addition , this functional also reproduces the experimental imt observed at high hydrostatic pressure on lamno@xmath0 @xcite and the doping induced imt on babio@xmath0 @xcite , supporting the idea of using a unique hybrid dft functional to study phase transitions .",
    "however , the use of plane - wave basis sets is a computationally demanding approach since plane - waves are global basis sets in contrast to local atomic - centered basis sets that provide a natural screening of the hfx potential within a few neighboring shells of atoms .",
    "thus , the use of plane - waves strongly limits the system size due to its poor scaling .",
    "note that sic - lda @xcite and gw @xcite approaches have also been used to study the low temperature phase of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "however these calculations were not carried out for full geometry relaxation and therefore , it is not clear if the results correspond to the true ground - state of the system .",
    "all calculations were performed with the replicated - data version of the crystal14 computational package @xcite .",
    "crystal14 is a first - principles electronic structure software that employs atom - centered gaussian - type orbital ( gto ) basis sets .",
    "gtos are used to build bloch functions to expand the one - electron crystalline orbitals .",
    "interestingly , gtos present a number of advantages including the use of local basis sets that contain minimal overlap with neighboring orbitals .",
    "this feature provides a significant improvement in computational scaling with increasing system size that allows for simulation of large - scale systems using dft hybrid functionals .",
    "this high computational efficiency is particularly important even for moderate size systems containing tens of atoms . indeed , while the hfx part of the simulation scales as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number of atoms making up the system , the scaling is reduced to @xmath33 for larger systems thanks to the built - in screening .",
    "all - electron gto basis sets for each atom comprising the lamno@xmath0 system were chosen as follows : for mn the 6 - 411d41 g atomic basis set generated by towler @xmath19 @xmath20 @xcite was employed ; for o the 8 - 411d basis set constructed by cor @xcite was used ; for la , the 61111sp-631d basis set with 1s , 6sp , 3d contractions was obtained directly from the crystal14 website @xcite .",
    "we added two 4f electron shells to the la basis set to better account for the la - o and mn - o covalency induced by the octahedral rotations found in this system @xcite .",
    "an 8 x 8 x 8 monkhorst - pack mesh @xcite that corresponds to 170 k - points in the irreducible brillouin zone has been adopted .",
    "we set the thresholds controlling the accuracy in the evaluation of coulomb and exchange integrals to 10@xmath34 ( itol1 , itol2 , itol3 , and itol4 , using notations from ref . ) and 10@xmath35 ( itol5 ) .",
    "the threshold on the scf energy was set to 10@xmath36 au .",
    "two different types of geometry optimizations have been performed depending on the lamno@xmath0 phase with the same convergence criterion on gradient components and nuclear displacements set to 0.0003 hartree / bohr and 0.0012 bohr respectively .",
    "for the low temperature orthorhombic phase a full relaxation scheme that optimizes both cell parameters and atomic coordinates was employed .",
    "in contrast , for the high temperature _ pseudo - cubic _ phase a constrained full geometry relaxation was carried out by imposing @xmath3 = @xmath4 and @xmath13 = @xmath3 @xmath37 , which leads to a single parameter optimization .",
    "as will be shown , this approach produces an error inferior to 0.1@xmath30 in the cell parameters compared to experiment .",
    "the hybrid functionals studied here include b3lyp @xcite , b3pw @xcite , the range separated hybrids : hse @xcite , hiss @xcite , lc-@xmath27pbe @xcite and the m06 meta - gga @xcite .",
    "we also carefully examined the effect of using different amounts of mixing of the pbe @xcite exchange potential v@xmath38 with hartree - fock exchange v@xmath23 potential ( pbe - hfx ) .",
    "the pbe - hfx mixing is expressed as in eq .",
    "1 , where @xmath24 = 0.05 , 0.10 , 0.15 , 0.20 and 0.25 ( @xmath24 = 0.25 represents the pbe0 @xcite hybrid functional ) . for convenience",
    "the pbe - hfx functionals will be written as pbe-5 , pbe-10 , pbe-15 , pbe-20 and pbe-25 ( pbe0 ) to represent the percentage of hfx mixing contained in them .",
    "similar notation will be used for hse ( hse - hfx ) .",
    "we will first study the performance of different hybrid functionals for the description of the experimental ground - state structure .",
    "then , the electronic and magnetic properties will be compared with the relaxed structure properties to evaluate how are they affected .",
    "this assessment will provide important information for down selecting candidate functionals to be used subsequently on the high temperature fm metallic phase .",
    "when determining the ground - state magnetic structure we considered all possible antiferromagnetic orderings ( a - afm , c - afm , and g - afm ) and a - type was found to have the lowest energy for all dft functionals .",
    "therefore , afm and a - afm will be used interchangeably .",
    "table i summarizes all numerical results obtained in our initial screening procedure applied to the experimental ground - state orthorhombic structure .",
    "it includes the total energy difference between afm and fm phases ( relative to the fm state ) , the bandgap , and the magnetic moments calculated for a variety of hybrid functionals as well as for the gga ( pbe ) functional .",
    "we also include a number of results reported in the literature , namely plane - wave basis set results obtained via pbe , pbe+u @xcite and hse @xcite .",
    "these results establish that the a - afm state is captured by pbe and all hybrid functionals with the notable exception of m06 .",
    "although pbe correctly describes the afm state , it significantly underestimates the bandgap ( 0.19 ev ) .",
    "pbe+u approximation does produce an afm insulating state for the optimal values of u = 8 ev and j = 2 ev with a significantly improved bandgap of 1.6 ev and a rather small 2 mev afm - fm energy difference .",
    "the origins of the difference between the results obtained by pbe-25 and hse-25 hybrid functionals lie in the amount of hfx that each functional contains for the long - range exchange interaction .",
    "pbe-25 has 25@xmath30 mixture of hfx for any range while hse-25 only contains the same mixture locally and 100@xmath30 pbe exchange at long - range .",
    "therefore pbe-25 predicts larger bandgaps and larger afm - fm energy differences while hse has a screened tail that favors a metallic behavior .",
    "since both magnetic state and bandgaps are affected by structural changes , the quality and robustness of these functionals must be assessed for full geometry relaxation .",
    "the second step of our functional search will make it possible to determine the effective capability of the hybrid functionals and the optimal hfx mixing to obtain accurate results of the low temperature afm insulating state .",
    "this determination will be performed by comparing the properties of fully relaxed structures directly to experiment .",

    "the bandgap is directly proportional to the percentage of hfx included in the functional .",

    "this behavior shows the importance of the hfx mixing contribution , where hfx in hse - hfx decays exponentially at long - range while pbe - hfx contains the same hfx amount at any range .",
    "therefore as the amount of hfx mixing decreases , hse - hfx will produce the transition from insulator to metal before pbe - hfx . including local hfx in the dft exchange functional is important to reproduce the insulating state , but it should be noted that the decay of the exchange potential at long - range needs an appropriate balance between exponential screening and 1/r behavior to be able to accurately capture the metallic and insulating state properties ( i.e. , size of bandgap ) .",
    "this feature is also reflected in table ii where @xmath3 and @xmath4 lattice parameters for hse-10 are significantly overestimated and underestimated respectively .",

    "however , the use of higher values of hfx mixing yields an insulating solution .    in fig .",
    "5 the projected density of states for pbe-5 and pbe-10 exhibits a half - metallic character due to the strong mn(3d - e@xmath11)-o(p ) hybridization that extends above the fermi level . note that this is the first time that a half - metallic character has been reported for the high temperature phase of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the fact that slightly lower values of hfx provide the appropriate description for the electron delocalization in lamno@xmath0 is not surprising since the functionals employed contain over 90@xmath30 pbe exchange and provide a mainly exponential screening at long - range , which as previously mentioned , favors a metallic behavior . as the amount of hfx",
    "is increased the system should begin to transition to a more insulating type state as seen in fig .",
    "however , in the low temperature phase studies it was found that using a mixing of 5@xmath30 of hfx or less leads to a metallic fm state .",
    "thus , from the low and high temperature investigations an optimum value of 10@xmath30 hfx mixing is chosen as the single hybrid functional that can accurately capture the electronic , magnetic and structural properties of both phases .",
    "we note that all simulations performed in the _ pseudo - cubic _ high t phase lead to a _",

    "6 shows the pdos of the mn 3d - e@xmath11 states in the vicinity of the fermi level for both low ( a ) and high ( b ) temperature phases .",
    "the jt distortions observed at low t are responsible for the additional energy splitting between e@xmath11 levels .",
    "as the temperature rises above 750 k a reduction in the jt parameters drives the system into a _",
    "pseudo - cubic _ structure producing mn sites with higher local symmetry as compared to the low temperature phase .",
    "this leads to a significant reduction in mn - e@xmath11 splitting , which produces nearly degenerate mn - e@xmath11 states .",
    "therefore , temperatures above 750 k provide an extra degree of freedom for electrons where the probability of occupying either e@xmath11 state is equal .",
    "this type of electron disorder can be viewed as a type of entropy of mixing similar to a high temperature homogeneously disordered 50 - 50 binary alloy where the probability of occupancy of either alloying species is the same .",
    "this effect lowers the free energy via an entropy of mixing type term ( the orbital ordered phase has zero entropy ) .",
    "it should be note that octahedral tilts and rotations in the high t phase remain almost identical ( with small decreases ) compared to the low t phase as it can be seen in fig .",
    "1 . at even higher temperatures",
    "the jt distortions disappear leading to regular mno@xmath5 octahedra with equal mn - o bond distances @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "we have identified two hybrid functionals based on 5@xmath30 and 10@xmath30 hfx mixing with 95@xmath30 and 90@xmath30 of pbe exchange respectively ( pbe-5 and pbe-10 ) that reproduce the high temperature fm metallic phase .",
    "however , only the pbe-10 hybrid functional can accurately account for both low and high t phases of lamno@xmath0 where for the first time , we have uncovered a half - metallic fm system within a dft framework .",
    "we have shown that a single hybrid dft functional with a particular hfx mixing can be used to describe systems where the electronic correlation depends on a range of conditions .",
    "this technique has been applied to lamno@xmath0 .",
    "lamno@xmath0 is a particularly challenging material , since it contains strong coupling of spin , charge , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "this coupling is very sensitive to small changes in local structure where the distortions of the mno@xmath5 octahedra play an important role on the observed properties . by using 10@xmath30 hfx with 90@xmath30 pbe exchange we are able to accurately capture the effects of the jt distortions on the electronic , magnetic , and crystal structure on both low and high temperature phases .",
