    "in recent years , many astrophysical and cosmological experiments have indicated the presence of dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "the leading candidate for this dm is a particle  @xcite .",
    "there are many pieces of evidence that the dm component of the universe may be light and at gev scale .",
    "the dm of this scale has been invoked to explain several recent experimental results  @xcite , including the annual modulation of the dama / libra  @xcite and the 511 kev photon signal from the spi / integral  @xcite .",
    "sub - gev scale bosons have also been used to interpret the excess in the cosmic ray positron reported by pamela  @xcite and the total electron and positron flux measured by atic  @xcite , as well as preliminary result from fermi - lat  @xcite .",
    "the light u boson may couple to the sm charged particles with a much suppressed coupling which has been considered in various contexts  @xcite .",
    "we consider the new abelian gauge group @xmath4 which has a gauge - invariant kinetic mixing with the sm hypercharge @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , we have the lagrangian @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the sm lagrangian , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the field strength for @xmath2 boson and the gauge boson @xmath10 of u(1)@xmath11 , @xmath12 is the gauge field of a massive dark @xmath4 gauge group  @xcite . the second term in eq.([mixingl ] )",
    "is kinetic mixing operator , and @xmath13 is generated at any scale by loops of heavy fields charged under both @xmath14s . in a supersymmetry theory ,",
    "the kinetic mixing operator induces a mixing between the d - terms associated with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the hypercharge d - term gets a vacuum expectation value from electroweak symmetry breaking and induces a weak - scale effective fayet - iliopoulos term for @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the @xmath4 symmetry breaking scale is naturally suppressed by loop factor or by @xmath15 , leading to mev to gev - scale u boson mass  @xcite . the parameters of concern in this letter are @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "it is also natural to conceive the existence of an elementary higgs - like boson , the @xmath18 , which spontaneously breaks the symmetry as argued in reference  @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath2 boson will in general have a substantial branching ratio to lepton pairs , the decays of the higgs will depend on its mass relative to that of the @xmath2 boson .",
    "if the higgs is light it will decay via loop processes to leptons and possible hadrons , in which case it is long - lived and will most likely appear as missing energy .",
    "otherwise , if it is heavy , it will decay to double @xmath2 bosons , and finally can be seen in multiple lepton final states .",
    "an interesting consequence of the above hypotheses is that they must induce observable effects in low energy @xmath1 colliders , such as the existing or future super - flavor factories .",
    "a more comprehensive discussion of these effects can be found in references  @xcite ,  @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "both the @xmath2 boson and the @xmath18 can be produced at bepcii , if their masses are less than charmonium states . although the luminosity of bepcii is order of magnitude lower than that at b factories , the production cross - sections scale as @xmath19 , which essentially compensates the lower luminosity at bepcii .",
    "furthermore , bepcii is better suited for detecting particles with mass around 1 gev , and also is a great lab to look for @xmath2 boson and @xmath18 in @xmath20 decays , which will be produced with huge sample ( @xmath21 @xmath22 decays events per year at bepcii ) .",
    "these considerations motivate searching for dark - sector events in various channels at bepcii / bes - iii .",
    "we will mainly argue the following processes at bes - iii :    * @xmath23 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 could be electron or muon ; * @xmath26 ; * @xmath27 ; * @xmath28missing energy ; or @xmath29 ;",
    "the bes - iii detector consists mainly of a cylindrical main draft chamber ( mdc ) with momentum resolution @xmath30 for a charged particle with momentum at 1.0 gev , the time - of - flight ( tof ) system with two layers of plastic scintillator counters located outside of mdc , and highly hermetic electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) with energy resolution of @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the mdc has its first sensitive layer at a radius of 6.0 cm from the interaction point ( ip ) , and the mdc combined with a b field of 1.0 t , provide a precise momentum measurements of charged particles with transverse momentum greater than 50 mev .",
    "photons of energy down to 20 mev and polar angle in the range @xmath32 can be detected with good efficiency by emc .",
    "bes - iii has so far acquired about @xmath33 and @xmath34 at @xmath35 and j/@xmath20 peaks , respectively . in the next few years , by year 2014 , @xmath21 events on j/@xmath20 peak and @xmath36 events on @xmath35 peak will be collected .",
    "the expected data samples per year running at bes - iii are summarized in table  [ tab:1 ] .",
    "for this letter , the sensitivity studies are based on 3 fb@xmath37 luminosity at the @xmath22 or @xmath35 peak and 20fb@xmath37 at the @xmath38 peak for the searching for the dark sector .",
