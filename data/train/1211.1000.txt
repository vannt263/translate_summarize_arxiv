    "it is an indisputable fact that the atlas and cms collaborations of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) have discovered a new particle @xcite , with mass near 126 gev and consistent with the higgs boson @xcite of the standard model @xcite .",
    "this discovery is corroborated by indications seen by the tevatron collaborations cdf and d0 @xcite .",
    "this particle was mainly discovered via its decay into two photons @xcite , from which we can also infer that it has integer spin .",
    "second in importance is the decay @xmath0 with several different final states @xcite , followed by the decay @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , before claiming that the discovered particle is indeed the higgs boson , some extra measurements must be performed , in particular its spin @xcite and its decay rate into fermions @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry also has been looked for with a lot of effort at the lhc .",
    "there is a relatively large production cross section for squarks ( if their masses are not larger than a few hundreds of gev ) , but no signal has been found so far .",
    "lower bounds have been set of several hundreds of gev for their masses @xcite .",
    "in addition , the minimal supergravity model is strongly constrained by these searches , implying restrictions on the universal scalar mass @xmath2 , since it should be smaller than a few thousands of gev @xcite .",
    "these results point to the split supersymmetric models @xcite , where all sfermions are very heavy while charginos and neutralinos remain light .",
    "charginos and neutralinos have been searched at the lhc with the result of lower bounds on their masses being set @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , there is still lots of room for supersymmetry , in particular for the r - parity violating scenarios , which are only slightly tested @xcite .",
    "if r - parity is not conserved , neutrino masses can be generated @xcite .",
    "this can be done without introducing problems with too fast proton decay @xcite .",
    "this is so because neutrino masses need only lepton number violation , while proton decay needs both lepton and baryon number violation .",
    "another issue to be considered is that , if r - parity is conserved , the lightest neutralino is a dark matter candidate @xcite , but this is no longer the case if r - parity is violated .",
    "nevertheless , in models with r - parity violation the gravitino can be a good dark matter candidate since it can live longer than the age of the universe @xcite .",
    "in this article we study the implications of a higgs boson mass of 126 gev on a split supersymmetric model , which includes r - parity bilinearly violated terms .",
    "we check that in this case the split supersymmetric scale @xmath3 is rather low , making the ss parameters @xmath4 to differ from mssm equivalent parameters in at most @xmath5 , which is a challenge for the lhc and a potential mission for the ilc .",
    "we check that the case @xmath6 is not ruled out , as in the mssm , because of lack of cancellation between quark and squark loops .",
    "the price to pay may be the divergence of the top quark yukawa coupling at scales larger than @xmath3 but smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "this does not excludes the scenario , but implies the appearance of new physics at that scale .",
    "we prove that the absolute value of the parameter @xmath8 , which relates to the atmospheric mass and is defined later , tends to be larger than in models where the higgs mass is not constrained .",
    "we also prove that the r - parity violating parameters @xmath9 and @xmath10 , also defined later , are of the order of 0.1 gev , similar to other models .",

    "we start at the electroweak scale @xmath19 with sm - rge , changing at the scale @xmath16 to ss - rge , and changing again at the @xmath3 scale to the mssm - rge @xcite .",

    "we obtain a value @xmath48 which is way too large .    for extreme values like @xmath6",
    ", we can have a value for the higgs mass consistent with the experimental evidence , nevertheless , unification of gauge couplings fails because the top quark yukawa coupling becomes unperturbatively large at a scale larger than @xmath3 .",

    "the fact that the top yukawa coupling diverges is an indication of new physics appearing at that scale .",
    "the model ceases to be valid beyond that scale . in the figure",
    "we show also the threshold at @xmath3 .",
    "below it the ss - rge controls the behavior of the top quark yukawa @xmath49 and its evolution is the same for any of the chosen values for @xmath3 .",
    "after that threshold we switch to the mssm - rge for @xmath49 which hold the following boundary condition , @xmath50 and this explains the discontinuity for @xmath49 at the threshold .",

    "the explanation is that in the mssm top quark contributions to the higgs mass are partially cancelled by the stop quark contributions , while in ss this later contribution is absent due to the decoupling of the squarks .",
