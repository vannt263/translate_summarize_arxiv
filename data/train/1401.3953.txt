    "most of the currently known heaviest nuclei , in particular all beyond @xmath4 , decay via a sequence of alpha particle emissions @xcite .",
    "energy release in an @xmath1-decay of a nucleus with @xmath5 protons and @xmath6 neutrons , @xmath7 , is directly related to nuclear masses @xmath8 hence energies @xmath9 @xcite measured in a chain of @xmath1-decays provide a link between masses of parent and daughter nuclei if they can be identified as g.s to g.s transitions .",
    "they can also determine a newly created nuclide when @xmath9 of one of the consecutive decays matches the value characteristic of an already known parent isotope .",
    "besides providing a hint for the identification of new elements , @xmath2 values are the main factor determining the half - life with respect to the @xmath1-decay .",
    "since these half - lives directly relate to the detection pattern , a possibly accurate determination of @xmath2 is important for the search for new elements . finally , although many masses of sh isotopes are unknown , this observable provides a test of a local dependence of theoretical masses on @xmath5 and @xmath6 .    while the calculations of masses for even - even nuclei are readily available in the literature , similar systematic calculations for the odd and odd - odd systems are less frequent . here",
    ", we report such calculations for heavy and sh nuclei within the microscopic - macroscopic model based on the deformed woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "this model was widely applied to many problems of nuclear structure over many years .",
    "recently , in a version adjusted to heavy nuclei @xcite , we used it to reproduce data on first @xcite , second @xcite and third barriers @xcite and on second minima @xcite in actinides and to predict ground states and saddle - points in superheavy nuclei up to @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the general motivation of our study is to sharpen predictions of the model , i.e. masses , @xmath2 values and fission barriers , by accounting for sufficiently many deformations ( which , for technical reasons , was not always practical in the past ) .",
    "the results obtained up to now reveal the importance of including some deformations , neglected in the previous calculations .",
    "this concerns especially studies of first , second and third fission barriers . in the region of sh nuclei , the predicted abundance of triaxial saddle points for @xmath11 @xcite calls into question all calculations assuming axial symmetry done previously .",
    "in the present paper we continue along this line by extending our model , which up to now was applied mainly to even - even nuclei , to odd and odd - odd nuclei . to be sure ,",
    "the woods - saxon model was used for odd sh nuclei previously , see for example @xcite .",
    "however , there are important differences between the present study and the previous ones : a different version of macroscopic energy giving different results , more restricted equilibrium shapes and fewer nuclei were studied in @xcite ; the study of ground and excited states in @xcite was performed solely without blocking .",
    "in extending the model we prefer to keep all essential parameters fixed in @xcite unchanged .",
    "the extension of the microscopic part consists in calculating the shell and pairing correction energy for a system with an odd number of nucleons .",
    "this is done in two ways , differing by a treatment of the odd particle .",
    "the macroscopic part is modified by including an additional average pairing energy contribution , different for even - odd , odd - even and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "these contributions are chosen as constants and fixed by a fit to the masses of trans - lead nuclei known in 2003 , in analogy to the fit for even - even nuclei done in @xcite .",
    "after that , the ground states of 1364 nuclei , from @xmath12 to @xmath13 , are determined by energy minimization over configurations with zero or one blocked particle over axially - symmetric deformations .",
    "the @xmath1-decay energies of sh nuclei calculated from these masses are compared to the measured values , including recent isotopic chains for @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this allows to appreciate the performance of the model outside the region of the original fit and to discuss some possible structure effects .",
    "we also make comparisons with results of some other models .",
    "a description of our model and calculations is given in section ii .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section iii . finally , the conclusions are summarized in section iv .",
    "our microscopic - macroscopic model is based on a deformed woods - saxon potential @xcite . in this study",
    "we focus on nuclear ground states . therefore , it is possible to confine analysis to axially - symmetric shapes defined by the following equation of the nuclear surface : @xmath15   , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the volume - fixing factor and @xmath17 is the radius of a spherical nucleus . for the macroscopic part we used the yukawa plus exponential model @xcite . with the aim of adjusting the model especially for heavy and superheavy nuclei ,",
    "three parameters of the macroscopic energy formula and the pairing strengths were determined in @xcite by a fit to masses of even - even nuclei with @xmath18 and @xmath19 as given in @xcite .",
    "these parameters were used since then in all our calculations .    for systems with odd proton or neutron ( or both ) , a standard treatment is that of blocking .",
    "considered configurations consist of an odd particle occupying one of the levels close to the fermi level and the rest of the particles forming a paired bcs state on the remaining levels .",
    "the ground state is found by looking for a configuration ( blocking particles on levels from the 10-th below to 10-th above the fermi level ) and deformation giving the energy minimum . in the present study",
    ", we used this procedure including mass - symmetric deformations @xmath20 and @xmath21 , i.e the four - dimensional minimization is performed by the gradient method and , for the check , on the mesh of deformations : @xmath22 both sets of results are consistent ; lower energies from the gradient method are treated as final .",
    "the used deformation set should provide for a fair approximation , except for the region of light isotopes of elements between rn and light actinides , which show octupole deformation in their ground states .",
    "the values of parameters from @xcite were left unchanged for even - even nuclei . for the rest",
    ", we introduced three new parameters - additive constants which may be interpreted as corrections for the mean pairing energy in even - odd , odd - even and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "these parameters were fixed by a fit to the masses of odd - even , even - odd and odd - odd @xmath23 and @xmath19 nuclei taken from @xcite .",
    "it is known that the blocking procedure often causes an excessive reduction of the pairing gap in systems with odd particle number .",
    "one device to avoid an excessive even - odd staggering in nuclear binding was to assume stronger ( typically by @xmath24 5% ) pairing interaction for odd - particle - number systems , see @xcite .",
    "since the main predictions of this work are @xmath2 values in which the effect of stronger pairing in parent and daughter nuclei partially cancels out , we postpone for the future a more elaborate treatment of this effect . instead , we performed another calculations of nuclear masses without blocking .",
    "shell ( and pairing ) correction energy of a configuration with an odd neutron ( or proton ) was taken as a sum of the quasiparticle energy of a singly occupied level @xmath25 and the shell ( and pairing ) correction calculated without blocking .",
    "the latter quantity , as well as the pairing gap @xmath26 and the fermi energy @xmath27 , are calculated for the odd number of particles , but with the double occupation of all levels .",
    "this prescription was used before in @xcite .",
    "it gives results similar to those obtained when calculating @xmath26 , @xmath27 and the shell ( and pairing ) correction for the even system with one particle less .",
    "the calculation without blocking is much simpler and we were able to perform a seven - dimensional minimization over axially - symmetric deformations @xmath28 and @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , these results should be reliable also for light actinides . as we preferred to avoid a new fit of the macroscopic model parameters ,",
    "also for this model we introduced three additive constants ( energy shifts ) for even - odd , odd - even and odd - odd nuclei which minimize the rms deviation in each of the groups of nuclei .",
    "structure of odd - odd nuclei is more complicated than that of odd-@xmath29 systems .",
    "if we disregard collective vibrations , the ground state configuration is a result of coupling the unpaired neutron and proton to a total angular momentum .",
    "the energy ordering of coupled configurations is usually attributed to a residual neutron - proton interaction @xmath30 . in spherical nuclei",
    "it is summarized by the empirical nordheim rule @xcite .    in deformed , axially symmetric nuclei ,",
    "in which the projection of the single - particle angular momentum on the symmetry axis @xmath31 is a good quantum number , the n - p coupling can give two configurations with @xmath32 . according to the empirical gallagher - moszkowski rule @xcite ,",
    "the one energetically favoured is the spin triplet state .",
    "the spin structure of both n and p single particle orbitals shows which @xmath33 configuration will be the lower one .",
    "a collective rotational band is built on each of two bandheads .",
    "energies of the band members with angular momentum @xmath34 are usually presented as @xcite @xmath35 +     e_k + ( -)^i \\delta_{k,0 } ( e_0+e_a ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath36 represents the mean - field energy of a bandhead configuration , the second term is the rotational energy , @xmath37 is the diagonal matrix element of @xmath30 , the last term , combined of the newby shift @xmath38 and the diagonal coriolis term @xmath39 for @xmath40 , occurs only for @xmath41 bands and splits them into two subbands .",
    "in such a formula , all off - diagonal matrix elements of the interaction @xmath30 and of the rotor - plus - two - particles hamiltonian are neglected . from the experimental data in rare earth and actinide regions , the newby shifts @xmath38 and gallagher - moszkowski shifts , defined as @xmath42 , were extracted @xcite .",
    "the former are usually less than 50 kev , while the latter amount to 100 - 300 kev .",
    "the above information is incorporated in mass formulas by defining some average ( i.e. configuration - independent ) neutron - proton energies for odd - odd nuclei .",
    "their role is to account for the shift in the g.s .",
    "energy with respect to the value caluclated with blocking or quasiparticle method that would simulate on average the terms beyond @xmath36 in eq .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the additional binding @xmath43 is included which amounts to @xmath44 kev for odd - odd actinides .",
    "although this term is @xmath29-dependent in @xcite , one can see that the difference in it between actinides and superheavy nuclei is around 20 kev .",
    "therefore , as we confine here our model to heavy and superheavy nuclei , we assume constant average neutron - proton and average pairing energies .",
    "this leaves three constants : @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( see table 1 and 2 ) that can be fit to odd-@xmath29 and odd - odd nuclei ; they correspond to the parameters @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 of the model used in @xcite .",
    "thus , we calculate the mass of an odd - odd nucleus within the blocking method by adding 1.703 mev to the micro - macro energy of the optimal configuration .",
    "this corresponds to the neutron - proton energy of @xmath51 kev ( table 1 ) .    since the g.s",
    "configurations must be energetically favored , the parent and daughter energy shifts @xmath37 will cancel in large part in @xmath2 values .      considering a comparison of measured and calculated @xmath1-decay energies ,",
    "it is important to observe the hindrance of @xmath1 transitions between different configurations in odd-@xmath29 and odd - odd nuclei .",
    "although a degree of this hindrance is surely configuration - dependent , if strong enough , it can hide the true @xmath2 value when only a few transitions are detected in experiment . at present",
    ", this is the situation in many heaviest nuclei",
    ".    one can consult the known data to see the magnitude of hindrance .",
    "for example , the isotopes @xmath52fm , @xmath53no and @xmath54rf decay primarily to the @xmath55 parent g.s .",
    "configurations in daughters , which lie at the excitation energy of 200 - 400 kev , with probabilities , respectively , 87% @xcite , 96% @xcite and @xmath56% @xcite . in 82% of cases",
    ", @xmath57cf decays to the @xmath55 parent configuration ; the @xmath58 g.s . in @xmath59 cm daughter",
    "is populated only in 2.5% of cases @xcite . in the decay of @xmath52cf , the hindrance of the g.s . to g.s transition ( @xmath60 ) results in the g.s .",
    "band in daughter receiving @xmath61% of cases ; 2.6% of those decays goes to the g.s .",
    "much reduced @xmath33-hindrance is seen in the decay of @xmath57bk ( @xmath58 ) : more than 90% of decays goes to the g.s . rotational band in @xmath59am , built on the @xmath62 configuration , in that 6.6% to the g.s @xcite .    motivated by these examples , to set an upper limit for an underestimate of @xmath2",
    ", we also calculate apparent @xmath2 values taking the parent g.s .",
    "configuration as the final state in daughter .",
    "such a value is smaller than the true @xmath2 by the excitation of the parent g.s .",
    "configuration in the daughter .",
    "gallagher shifts also mostly cancel in such transition energies .",
    "the quality of the mass fit is summarized in tables i and ii where the deviations from the experimental masses are given for each of the four groups of nuclei .",
    "the data are taken from @xcite , also for even - even nuclei .",
    "statistical parameters of the fit for this group are different in tables i and ii because of different deformations included .",
    "deviations in table ii slightly differ from those in @xcite because we used here a larger number of data from @xcite .",
    "one can observe that the model with blocking is worse for even - odd and odd - even systems than for the even - even ones ; the quality deteriorates further for odd - odd systems .",
    "a different situation occurs for the results without blocking : the worst case are the odd - even systems ; odd - odd masses are rather well described .",
    "the differences in @xmath63 between groups of nuclei may show a need to refit some of the parameters fixed for even - even nuclei , but this requires more study .",
    "one can observe that our local fit is better that those resulting from the self - consistent models .",
    "for example , after adding to the typical skyrme forces the phenomenological wigner term , microscopic contact pairing force and correction for spurious collective energy , the root - mean square deviation equal 0.58 mev has been obtained in a global calculation , see ref @xcite . in another hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb )",
    "model @xcite , aimed at fitting simultaneously masses and fission data , a phenomenological correction for collective vibrations allowed to obtain the r.m.s deviation of 0.729 mev .",
    "recently hfb calculations via refitting to the 2012 atomic mass evaluation ( ame ) and varying the symmetry coefficients gave in the best case a value of 0.54 mev r.m.s @xcite .",
    "macroscopic - microscopic global calculations of nuclear masses made by p. moller and co - workers @xcite give the r.m.s error 0.669 mev for nuclei ranging from oxygen to hassium and 0.448 mev in the case of nuclei above @xmath64 . a phenomenological formula with the 10 free parameters by duflo and zuker",
    "@xcite gives mass estimates with the 0.574 mev r.m.s error .",
    "recently , authors of @xcite achieved the r.m.s deviation of 0.34 kev in a fit to masses of 2149 nuclei , however , at the cost of including many corrections with often a rather obscure physical meaning .",

    "our results are slightly overestimated . at present ,",

    "a systematic calculation of nuclear masses in the region of superheavy nuclei , including odd and odd - odd systems , was performed within the microscopic - macroscopic model with the woods - saxon deformed potential .",
    "two versions of the model were used , with and without blocking . a fit in the region of heavy nuclei",
    "was performed to fix 3 additional parameters of the model , one for each group of odd - a and odd - odd nuclei , while keeping all previous parameters as they were used for even - even nuclei .",
    "then , the @xmath2 values were calculated for sh nuclei as a prediction of the model to be compared against the data .",
    "the quality of the prediction turns out better than the quality of the model in the region of the fit : in the version with blocking , the mean and rms deviations of 217 and 274 kev for 88 sh nuclei are smaller than 326 and 426 kev for the 204 nuclei from the fit region . the quasiparticle method , clearly better in the region of the fit , for sh nuclei gives similar mean and rms deviations of 196 and 260 kev as the calcutions with blocking .",
    "both versions of the model similarly overestimate @xmath2 values for @xmath3 and underestimate them , although to a lesser extent , around @xmath166 . at present , these result should be treated with some care .",
    "many of synthesized sh isotopes are odd-@xmath29 or odd - odd nuclei and in many cases the statistics of @xmath9 values is not large .",
    "therefore it is not completely clear whether some of those cases may be explained by a hindrance of g.s . to g.s .",
    "transitions . the g.s .",
    "configurations of some sh nuclei , especially those involving high - k intruder orbitals , strongly hint to a possibility of @xmath1-decay hindrance , for example , for @xmath116 , @xmath124 .    as comparisons to other models show , the agreement with data obtained here , without any parameter adjustment for @xmath2 and with a minimal adjustment for masses , is surely not worse .",
    "this gives a confidence that some refinements , especially in the treatment of pairing , may still moderately improve the agreement with data .",
