    "the theoretical analysis of the properties of the knc @xmath21 is focused on the calculation of the binding energy @xmath28 and the partial widths @xmath29 and @xmath30 of all hadronic decay modes , which are the important two  body non  pionic @xmath31 decay modes and the three  body pionic @xmath32 decay modes , respectively . in the potential model approach by akaishi and yamazaki @xcite@xcite as well as in other theoretical approaches for the description of the knc @xmath21 @xcite@xcite such as relativistic mean field ( rmf ) models @xcite , coupled ",

    "some estimates of the non  pionic decay modes of the knc @xmath21 , carried out in the potential model approach and coupled  channel approach with chiral dynamics , predict the widths of order of @xmath34 .",
    "recent calculation of the transitions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , where the @xmath5 resonance is denoted as @xmath37 @xcite@xcite , which has been carried out in @xcite at threshold of the unbound @xmath38 system , showed a total width of non  pionic decay modes of the unbound @xmath38 system equal to @xmath39 .    since the decay mode @xmath40 is used for the experimental observation of the knc @xmath21 @xcite , an alternative approach allowing a calculation of the widths of all non  pionic and pionic decay modes for quasi  bound @xmath21 state is needed .",
    "the first announcement about the existence of the knc @xmath21 with the binding energy @xmath41 and the total width @xmath42 has been reported by the finuda collaboration @xcite .",
    "these data have been obtained from the stopped @xmath43meson reactions on @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 by measuring the invariant - mass spectrum of back  to  back emitted @xmath47 pairs .",
    "however , the interpretation of these results as a knc @xmath21 has been questioned and other explanations of the observed spectrum have been put forward @xcite .",
    "recent experimental data @xcite on the analysis of the exclusive @xmath48meson missing mass and @xmath49 invariant mass spectra of the final state in the @xmath50 reaction at the incident proton kinetic energy @xmath51 showed the quasi  bound state @xmath21 with the binding energy @xmath52 and the width @xmath53 .",
    "the important distinction of such a quasi  bound state is its two  body decays into the @xmath49 channel , enhanced at high momentum transfer and predicted by the relevant reaction theory @xcite@xcite , showing a creation of a compact object .",
    "thus , for the analysis of such a quasi  bound state one can not use the coupled  channel faddeev equation approach @xcite , which is unable to describe the two  body decay channels . in turn , a description of the experimental data by the disto collaboration within other theoretical approaches @xcite@xcite seems to be also questionable .",
    "the knc @xmath21 with the structure @xmath54 we propose to treat as a kaonic molecule @xcite . in the center of mass frame molecular states are defined by rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "since the angular momentum of the knc @xmath55 as well as of the knc @xmath56 , the quasi  bound @xmath4 state , are equal to zero , the properties of these states are defined by the vibrational degrees of freedom only , which we describe by trial harmonic oscillator wave functions",

    "according to quantum field theoretic description of decays of particles and nuclear states @xcite , the width of the decay modes @xmath62 of the nuclear state @xmath63 is defined by the decay amplitudes @xmath64 as @xmath65 where we have used a relation @xmath66 .",
