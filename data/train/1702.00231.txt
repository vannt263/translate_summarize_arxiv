    "one fascinating phenomenon of quantum mechanics is the quantum nonlocality , that is , there exist some global quantum operations on a composite system that can not be implemented by the owners of the subsystems using local operations and classical communication ( locc ) only .",
    "a general strategy to study quantum nonlocality is to consider what kind of information processing tasks can be achieved by locc . roughly speaking ,",
    "if a certain task is accomplished with different optimal global and local efficiencies , then we can construct a class of quantum operations that can not be realized by locc .",
    "there is no doubt that the discrimination of orthogonal quantum states is an effective one and received considerable attention in the past decades .",
    "@xcite for a partial list .",
    "it is well - known that orthogonal quantum states can be perfectly distinguished if globe operations are permitted . and",
    "the set up of local distinguishability of quantum states is simple : two or more spatially separated observers share a composite quantum system prepared in one of many known mutually orthogonal quantum states .",
    "their goal is to identify the unknown states by locc .",
    "when we only need to distinguish two orthogonal multipartite pure states , the perfect local discrimination can always be achieved perfectly @xcite . nevertheless ,",
    "if we have more than two states to distinguish , they can not be perfectly distinguished by locc if one or more states are entangled @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is percipient since entanglement has been shown to ensure difficulty in state discrimination @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it has been shown that there exist sets of orthogonal product states that can not be discriminated perfectly by locc @xcite .",
    "however , the local indistinguishability might be overcome in the many copy scenario , which is the case that multiple copies of quantum states are provided .",
    "a simple example would be four @xmath5 bell states , which can be perfectly distinguished within two copies @xcite , while it is indistinguishable with a single copy @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that @xmath6 orthogonal pure states can always be perfectly distinguished by locc when @xmath7 copies of the unknown state are provided @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the available copies of the unknown state play a crucial role in local distinguishability .",
    "however , it turns out that there exist two quantum states , one of which is necessarily mixed , are locally indistinguishable , in the many copy scenario @xcite .",
    "thus , the local indistinguishability of orthogonal quantum states is more robust in mixed states for it persists even in the domain of multiple copies , whereas in the case of pure states it does not .",
    "proving local indistinguishability is hard even in the bipartite case , since our knowledge about locc is limited . to circumvent the difficulty , one approach is to show the indistinguishability by operations completely preserving positivity of partial transpose ( denote it shortly by ppt operations ) , and local indistinguishability automatically follows since the set of all locc operations will also preserving positivity of partial transpose .",
    "the advantage of this approach is that the set of ppt operations enjoys a tractable mathematical structure .",
    "it has been shown that the bipartite maximally entangled state and the normalized projection onto its orthogonal complement can not be distinguished by ppt operations in the many copy scenario @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the notion of ppt plays a significant role in quantum information theory .",
    "it has been used to provide some convenient criterion for the separability of quantum states @xcite , and study the problem of entanglement distillation , pure state transformation and communication over quantum channels ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in this paper , we contribute a simple criterion for verifying indistinguishability of bipartite quantum states by ppt operations , in the many copy scenario .",
    "this criterion is based on the observation that , if the support of some state is strongly ppt - unextendible , then any set of orthogonal states containing it can not be distinguished by ppt operations in the many copy scenario . here",
    "we say a subspace @xmath0 of some bipartite hilbert space _ strongly ppt - unextendible _",
    "if for any positive integer @xmath1 , there is no ppt state whose support is a subspace of the orthogonal complement of @xmath8 . and",
    "this concept is a natural generalization of the concept of _ strongly unextendible subspace _ , introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . to observe the strongly ppt - unextendibility",
    ", one witness is the so - called ppt - definite operator , which is a positive semidefinite operator whose partial transpose is positive definite .",
    "in fact , the existence of ppt - definite operators can be observed efficiently by semidefinite programming ( sdp ) @xcite , which is a powerful tool in quantum information theory with many applications ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as an application",
    ", we show that any entangled pure states and the normalized projector onto their orthogonal complement can not be distinguished by ppt operations in the many copy scenario , which is a far - reaching extension of one of the main results in ref .",
    "meanwhile , we show that the minimum dimension of strongly ppt - unextendible subspaces in a @xmath3 system is @xmath4 , which extends the result on the minimum dimension of the ppt - unextendible subspace in ref .",
    "we review some notations and definitions . in the following",
    ", we will use symbols such as @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) to denote ( finite - dimensional ) hilbert spaces associated with alice and bob , respectively .",
    "the dimension of @xmath9 and @xmath11 are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "we say two subspaces @xmath15 and @xmath16 of some hilbert space are orthogonal , denoted by @xmath17 , if for any @xmath18 and @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",

    "the space of all linear operators over @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath22 . for convenience , we use @xmath23 and @xmath24 to denote the maximum eigenvalue and the minimum eigenvalue of some operator @xmath25 .",
    "a quantum state is characterized by its density operator @xmath26 , which is a positive semidefinite operator with trace unity .",
    "the support of @xmath27 , denoted by @xmath28 , is defined to be the space spanned by the eigenvectors of @xmath27 with positive eigenvalues .",
    "we say a positive semidefinite operator @xmath29 is supporting on some subspace @xmath0 of @xmath9 , if @xmath30 is a subspace of @xmath0 .    a bipartite positive semidefinite operator @xmath31 is said to be positive - partial - transpose ( ppt ) if @xmath32 is positive semidefinite , where the action of partial transpose ( with respect to @xmath33 ) is defined as @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , a ppt operator @xmath35 is said to be _ ppt - definite _ , if @xmath32 is positive definite .    in this paper ,",
    "the ppt operations used for distinguishing a set of @xmath36 orthogonal quantum states @xmath37 can be defined as a @xmath36-tuple of operators , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is ppt for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "these definitions can be naturally generalized when multiple copies are provided .",
    "in addition , we would say a set of orthogonal quantum states @xmath45 is indistinguishable by ppt operations in the many copy scenario , if for any positive integer @xmath1 , @xmath46 is indistinguishable by ppt operations .    in the end",
    ", we say a bipartite subspace @xmath0 of @xmath47 is said to be ppt - extendible , if there exists a ppt operator @xmath48 , such that @xmath49 is supporting on the orthogonal complement of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is said to be ppt - unextendible if it is not ppt - extendible , and to be strongly ppt - unextendible if for any positive integer @xmath1 , @xmath8 is not ppt - extendible .",
    "the main result of this paper is a sufficient criterion for verifying the ppt indistinguishability of orthogonal quantum states :    [ p ppt - definite ] for a set of orthogonal bipartite quantum states @xmath45 , if there is a ppt - definite operator supporting on the support of some @xmath50 , then @xmath45 is indistinguishable by ppt operations in the many copy scenario .    to prove this theorem , we first show the following lemma .

    "now , it is sufficient to show that the property of strongly ppt - unextendible can be observed by ppt - definite operator :    [ perp ppt ] given a bipartite subspace @xmath0 of @xmath64 , if there is a ppt - definite operator @xmath49 supporting on @xmath0 , then @xmath0 is strongly ppt unextendible .",
