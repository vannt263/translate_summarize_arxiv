    "in this paper , we consider the following 2d keller - segel equations @xmath0 this system was originally established by patlak @xcite and keller & segel @xcite to model the phenomenon of chomotaxis , in which cells approach the chemically favorable environments according to the chemical substance generated by cells . here",
    "@xmath1 denotes the density distribution of of cells and @xmath2 denotes the the chemical concentration .",
    "mathematically , this model describes the competition between the diffusion and the nonlocal aggregation .",
    "this type of competition is ubiquitous in evolutionary systems from biology , social science and other interacting particle systems , numerous mathematical studies of the keller - segel system and its variants have been conducted in recent years ; see @xcite for a general discussion .",
    "when @xmath3 , the system ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) ( [ eq : c0 ] ) is called the parabolic - parabolic model , whereas when @xmath4 , it is called the parabolic - elliptic model . when @xmath5 , the model is in a transition regime between the parabolic - parabolic and the parabolic - elliptic cases . for the parabolic - elliptic model",
    ", it is well known that @xmath6 is the critical mass that distinguishes the global - existent solution from finite - time blow up solution by utilizing the logarithmic hardy - littlewood sobolev inequality @xcite .",
    "more recently , liu and wang have proved the uniqueness of the weak solutions when the initial mass is less than @xmath7 and the initial free energy and the second moment are finite @xcite . for the parabolic - parabolic model , the global existence",
    "is analyzed and the critical mass ( which is also @xmath8 ) is derived in @xcite .",
    "most analytical results rely on the variational formation .",
    "in particular , we denote the free energy of the parabolic - parabolic system as @xmath9 dx,\\ ] ] where we have suppressed the superscript @xmath10 for simplicity ; see @xcite .",
    "then the system and can be formulated by the following mixed conservative and nonconservative gradient flow @xmath11 this mixed variational structure is known as the le chterlier principle .",
    "formally when @xmath12 and @xmath13 solve the parabolic - parabolic system , the free energy @xmath14 satisfies the following entropy - dissipation equality @xmath15dx = 0.\\ ] ] in the parabolic - elliptic case , one can replace the equation of @xmath13 using the newtonian potential @xmath16 and the free energy for some proper @xmath12 is given by @xmath17dx + \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{\\r^2 \\times \\r^2 } \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\log |x - y| \\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) dx\\ , dy.\\ ] ]    we also consider the extension of the 2d keller - segel equations with degenerate diffusion @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the diffusion exponent , and we call it supercritical when @xmath20 , critical when @xmath21 and subcritical when @xmath22 .",
    "it is worth noting that the classification of the exponent is dimension dependent , the readers may refer to @xcite for a broad summary . then similar to the case @xmath21",
    ", we can generalize the free energy to @xmath23 dx,\\ ] ] which , again by the le chterlier principle , satisfies the entropy - dissipation equality as follows @xmath24dx = 0.\\ ] ] an analogy of ( [ eq:111 ] ) with @xmath25 can be similarly defined .",
    "while the keller - segel equations have been well studied and understood in the analytical aspect , there is much to explore in the numerical computations .",
    "owing to the similarity to the drift - diffusion equation , filbet proposed an implicit finite volume method ( fvm ) for the keller - segel model @xcite .",
    "however , instead of being repulsive , the aggregation term in the keller - segel equation is attractive which competes against the diffusion term , the fvm method is constrained by severe stability constraint . in @xcite , chertock and kurganov",
    "designed a second - order positivity preserving central - upwind scheme for the chemotaxis models by converting the keller - segel equations to an advection - reaction - diffusion system .",
    "the main issue there is that the jacobian matrices coming from the advection part may have complex eigenvalues , which force the advection part to be solved together with the stabilizing diffusion terms , and result in complicated cfl conditions .",
    "based on this formulation , kurganov and his collaborators have conducted many extensions , including more general chemotaxis flux model , multi - species model and constructing an alternative discontinuous galerkin method ; see @xcite .",
    "very recently , li et .",
    "al have improved the results in @xcite by introducing the local discontinuous galerkin method with optimal rate of convergence @xcite .",
    "another drawback of the methods based on the advection - reaction - diffusion formulation is , in the transient regime when @xmath5 , this methods suffer from the stiffness in @xmath10 and the stability constrains are therefore magnified .",
    "besides , there is a kinetic formulation modeling the competition of diffusion and nonlocal aggregation , and some works on numerical simulation are available in @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to develop a numerical method which preserves both positivity and asymptotic limit .",
    "namely , the numerical method does not generate negative density if initialized properly under a less strict stability condition . moreover",
    ", such condition does not deteriorate with the decreasing of @xmath10 , and when @xmath26 , the discrete scheme of the parabolic - parabolic system automatically becomes a stable solver to the parabolic - elliptic system .",
    "in other words , we expect the numerical method to preserve the quasi - static limit of the keller - segel system in the transient regime .",
    "the key ingredient in our scheme is the following reformulation of the density equation @xmath27 which is reminiscent of the symmetric fokker - planck equation .",
    "therefore , we can propose a semi - discrete approximation of ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) in the following way @xmath28 it is interesting to point out that the above discretization ( [ semi1 ] ) is equivalent to a first order convex splitting scheme ; see @xcite . to see this , we reformulate as @xmath29",
    "the analog of the equation with the diffusion exponent @xmath30 is @xmath31.\\ ] ] as we shall design numerical methods based on this formulation as well .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we conduct asymptotic analysis to the keller - segel equations in the transient regime ( @xmath5 ) in section [ sec : asymp ] . in section [ sec : m1 ] , we give a detailed construction and analysis of the numerical method , prove its stability , asymptotic preserving and positivity preserving properties , explore its high order accuracy analog and discuss its simplified structure in radial symmetric cases . in section [ sec : mn1 ] , we extend the numerical method to the keller - segel equations with degenerate diffusions . several numerical examples are given in the last section to verify the claimed properties and demonstrate its application in various challenging cases , including blow - up solutions , degenerate diffusions with large @xmath19 ( see @xcite ) and two - species models with different blowup behavior ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we carry out the asymptotic analysis to the solutions of the keller - segel equations ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) ( [ eq : c0 ] ) when @xmath5 .",
    "due to the presence of the small parameter @xmath10 , the solution @xmath32 is expected to experience a transient layer with a fast time scale @xmath33 . in particular , we construct the following ansatz for solutions @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents the solution inside the transition layer and thus depends on @xmath37 .",
    "plugging this ansatz into the equations ( [ eq : rho0 ] ) ( [ eq : c0 ] ) and collecting the systems due to their orders , we have , to the leading order : @xmath38 the initial conditions are given by @xmath39 clearly , equations ",
    "imply that @xmath40 therefore , if initially we have @xmath41 there is no initial layer in the solution @xmath32 .",
    "the next order expansions solve the following system @xmath42 with initial conditions @xmath43 thus if we can show the boundedness of @xmath44 and @xmath45 , the validity of the ansatz we proposed will be justified .",
    "further , certain estimates of @xmath46 are needed to show that as @xmath26 , the corrections terms vanish and the leading order system converges to the parabolic - elliptic system @xmath47    we remark that , the above asymptotic analysis is unclear from a rigorous standpoint , which is beyond the scope of this paper as we focus on designing numerical schemes .",
    "nevertheless , we shall explore numerically the asymptotic behavior of the solutions to give an intuitive justification of the above formal derivation .",
    "in this section , we aim to propose numerical schemes for the keller - segel system , which preserves the parabolic - elliptic limit in the discrete level as @xmath26 .",
    "we show that , under the small data assumption , our scheme ( both first and second order ) are unconditionally stable .",
    "the spatial discretization is carried out based on a symmetrization of the operators , with which we are able to prove its properties of mass conservation and positivity preservation .",
    "the extension to the radially symmetric cases is discussed at the end of this section .",
    "we first focus on the time discretization and present a semi - discrete scheme for the keller - segel equations . denote @xmath48 the time step , then @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 represents the numerical approximation to @xmath52 . without loss of generality ,",
    "we assume periodic boundary condition so that no boundary contribution shows up when applying integration by parts",
    ". in theory , other boundary condition can be similarly analyzed and we shall omit them here .    for stability concern ,",
    "we want to use implicit method as far as we can , but due to the nonlinearity of the system , this would require a newton solver that may converge slowly .",
    "here we propose the following semi - discrete scheme : @xmath53 to handle the above - mentioned two difficulties .",
    "as written , is just a linear equation for @xmath54 , and thus can be solved cheaply by inverting a symmetric matrix via conjugate gradient or directly using pseudo - spectral method .",
    "we will elaborate on it in the next sections .",
    "once @xmath54 is obtained , ( [ eq : rho ] ) reduces to linear equation for @xmath12 which can also be solved with ease if discretized appropriately .",
    "also , we observe that , if we formally take the @xmath26 limit with @xmath48 fixed , the numerical scheme converges to a semi - discrete method to the limiting parabolic - elliptic model .    to show the stability of this scheme",
    ", we have the following theorem .",
    "given a final time @xmath55 , then for @xmath56 , the semi - discrete numerical method and for the keller - segel equations is unconditionally stable if the small data condition @xmath57 is satisfied .",
    "multiply equation by @xmath58 and integrate with respect to @xmath59 , we get @xmath60 where the last term on the left is obtained using integration by parts .",
    "apply the cauchy - schwarz inequatlity , the right hand side of this equation has the following estimate @xmath61 next , we multiply equation by @xmath62 and integrate against @xmath59 . again with integration by parts , we obtain @xmath63 and the cauthy - schwarz inequality implies @xmath64 a combination of equation and then leads to @xmath65    to estimate the nonlinear term @xmath66 in the two dimensional case , we apply the _ ladyzhenskaya _ inequality and get @xmath67 hence we arrive at the following estimate @xmath68 thus , under the following small data assumption , @xmath69 we conclude that @xmath70 the by gronwall s inequality , if @xmath71 , we have @xmath72 correspondingly , the small data assumption requires @xmath73 which ends the proof .",
    "we end this part with a comment on the asymptotic preserving properties . as @xmath26 , the scheme the the parabolic - parabolic system not only converges to the one for the parabolic - elliptic system , but also keep the stability constraint unviolated , as seen from ( [ est : data20 ] ) .",
    "this formally justifies that the semi - discrete numerical method and is asymptotically preserving .      in this section ,",
    "we explore in detail the spatial discretizations of keller - segel equations .",
    "note that , naive discretizations of equation can easily destroy the positivity of the solution and trigger the instability .",
    "our main idea is to make use of the symmetric formulation of ( [ eq : sym1 ] ) to design a scheme that guarantees the positivity .",
    "more specifically , let @xmath74 , and rewrite ( [ eq : rho ] ) as @xmath75 where the right hand side is in the form of the fokker - planck operator and can be discretized symmetrically @xcite . in particular , we denote @xmath76 , and reformulate into @xmath77 such scheme has been shown to preserve positivity .",
    "indeed , since the left hand side is a positive definite operator on @xmath78 , and the the hand side is positive , as long as the spatial discretization preserves the positive definiteness , we can ensure the positivity of @xmath78 .",
    "a fully discrete scheme is in order .",
    "let the computational domain be @xmath79\\times [ c , d]$ ] , and we consider uniform spatial mesh with mesh size @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "thus the mesh grid points are @xmath82 .",
    "we apply the following five - point method for spatial decretization to get @xmath83 @xmath84 here , @xmath85",
    "@xmath86    when @xmath87 , we can simplfy the above expression to @xmath88 @xmath89 in the end , @xmath90 is easily obtained via @xmath91 multiply by @xmath92 and sum over @xmath93 , we get @xmath94 notice that @xmath95 which implies the conservation of mass in the discrete level , i.e. , @xmath96 for positivity , we have the following result .",
    "suppose initially we have @xmath97 for @xmath98 , then the five point scheme and guarantees @xmath99    the proof is standard and is similar to some existing results , the readers may consult @xcite for details .    to conclude the discussions on the first order scheme , we would like to give the following remarks ,    1 .   given that @xmath100 for @xmath98 and appropriate boundary conditions for @xmath32",
    ", we can show the positivity of @xmath101 @xmath102 , @xmath103 .",
    "2 .   other spatial discretization may apply to this semi - discrete system .",
    "especially , the @xmath32 equation can easily be solved by pseudo - spectral method .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that the positivity of @xmath104 is independent of the positivity of @xmath101 .",
    "hence , one has more freedom to solve the @xmath13 equation .",
    "this scheme can be easily extended to multi - species models , as will be shown in section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the scheme presented above can be directly extended to second order .",
    "as the spatial discretization builded upon the center difference is already second order accurate , we just focus on the second order time discretization , which can be accomplished using the backward difference formula ( bdf ) .",
    "specifically , the semi - discrete scheme reads @xmath105 again , as in the first order scheme , no nonlinear solver is needed : one can solve for @xmath54 from and then @xmath106 from ( [ eq : rho3 ] ) .",
    "a similar stability result is available .    given a final time @xmath55 , then for @xmath56 , the second order semi - discrete numerical method and for the keller - segel equations is unconditionally stable if the small data condition @xmath107 is satisfied .",
    "multiply equation by @xmath58 and integrate with respect to @xmath59 , by integration by parts , we get @xmath108 by the cauchy - schwarz inequality , the right hand can be estimated as @xmath61 again , by the _",
    "inequality , we get @xmath67 we multiply equation by @xmath62 and integrate with respect to @xmath59.with integration by parts , we obtain that @xmath109 and the cauthy - schwarz inequality implies , @xmath110 adding equation and , we get , @xmath111 assume that @xmath112 and @xmath113 are given by initial conditions , and @xmath114 and @xmath115 are computed by some first order scheme .",
    "for @xmath116 , @xmath117 , with @xmath118 , we sum up the above equations for @xmath119 , and get @xmath120 therefore , if the following small data assumption holds : @xmath121 we can conclude that , @xmath122 where @xmath123 by induction , we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 obviously , @xmath126 , and thus we have @xmath127 which implies @xmath128    subsequently , the following condition is sufficient to guarantee the small data estimate : @xmath129    we would remark that , the small data conditions are not necessary conditions , and are made primarily due to technical issues . in our numerical simulations , we observe that unless the exact solutions to the keller - segel equations blow up , the numerical methods do not exhibit unstable behavior .",
    "this section is devoted to the radially symmetric case .",
    "recall the first order semi - discrete scheme @xmath130 if we confine ourselves to the radially symmetric case , we can write @xmath131 and @xmath132 , and simplify the above semi - discrete scheme to @xmath133 then our task is to propose a numerical scheme to this system that is both conservative and positivity preserving .",

    "<S> we propose a semi - discrete scheme for 2d keller - segel equations based on a symmetrization reformation , which is equivalent to the convex splitting method and is free of any nonlinear solver . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , this new scheme is unconditionally stable as long as the initial condition does not exceed certain threshold , and it asymptotically preserves the quasi - static limit in the transient regime . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we prove that the fully discrete scheme is conservative and positivity preserving , which makes it ideal for simulations . the analogical schemes for the radial symmetric cases and the subcritical degenerate cases are also presented and analyzed . with extensive numerical tests , </S>",
    "<S> we verify the claimed properties of the methods and demonstrate their superiority in various challenging applications . </S>"
