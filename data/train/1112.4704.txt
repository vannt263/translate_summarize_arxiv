    "high - energy particle collisions constitute the main experimental tool in the investigation of the inner structure of matter . in particle physics",
    ", high - energy usually means center - of - mass energies above 10 @xmath4 @xmath5 10 gev , where @xmath4 is the proton mass = @xmath6 = 1 .",
    "typical units of energy are 1 gev = @xmath7 ev and 1 tev = @xmath8 ev . ] @xcite . presently , for particle - particle and antiparticle - particle collisions , the highest energies reached in accelerators concern proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) and antiproton - proton ( @xmath2 ) interactions , corresponding to 7 tev and @xmath5 2 tev , respectively .",
    "these hadronic processes are expected to be described by the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the non - abelian gauge field theory of the strong interactions @xcite .    as a non - abelian theory ,",
    "the gluons ( the field quanta ) themselves carry a color charge and can therefore interact with other gluons .",
    "the dynamical consequence is a running coupling constant @xmath9 : the color charge is small at short distances and large at large distances , leading to two different regimes named asymptotic freedom and confinement , respectively @xcite . in hadron - hadron collisions these regimes correspond to two sectors that have been known as hard scattering ( small distances and large values of the momentum transfer ) and soft scattering ( large distances and small values of the momentum transfer ) .",
    "the confinement barrier , where @xmath10 1 , is typical of distances of the order of 1 fm and therefore  peripheral \" hadronic collisions correspond to the soft sector .    the great triumph of qcd concerns the perturbative techniques , successfully applied in the hard sector @xcite .",
    "by contrast , soft interactions , characterized by small values of the momentum transfer , can not be treated through these techniques due to the rise of the coupling constant as the momentum transfer decreases . as a consequence ,",
    "soft physics demands first principles and nonperturbative approaches , which means the non - trivial investigation of the vacuum structure , intricate monte carlo simulations and complex analytic formalisms @xcite .",
    "however , despite the success of nonperturbative qcd in the investigation of the static hadronic properties ( bound states ) , a formal approach to _ soft scattering states _",
    ", based on first principles and without model assumptions , is still missing @xcite and that implies in some fundamental problems .",
    "soft scattering embodies elastic collisions and diffraction dissociation ( single and double ) @xcite and here comes one of the striking features of qcd : elastic scattering , the simplest kinematic collision process , just constitute one of the greatest dynamic problems for the theory of the strong interactions . in this respect ,",
    "the optical theorem @xcite plays a crucial role since it connects the forward _",
    "scattering amplitude with the most important physical quantity characterizing a collision process , namely the total cross section @xcite .",
    "therefore , the lack of a pure qcd result for the elastic amplitude puts serious limits in the theoretical investigation of the total hadronic cross section . on the other hand , and more important for our purposes , experimental information on the behavior of the total cross section",
    "may , in principle , be used as input providing new insights in the development of the theory in the soft sector ( the inverse problem ) , at least in what concerns the forward elastic scattering amplitude .    operationally the total cross section is defined by @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the luminosity ( flux per unit area ) and @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the rate of elastic and inelastic interactions , respectively ( scattered fluxes ) . from the definition ,",
    "two interpretations emerges for @xmath15 , one statistical , as a probability of interaction ( ratio between incident and scattered particles ) and another geometrical , as an effective area of interaction , usually measured in @xmath16 for hadronic scattering .",
    "experiments indicate that at lower energies , below @xmath5 2 gev , @xmath15 is characterized by narrow peaks , caused by the formation of resonances ( bound states ) . as the energy increases , reaching the scattering region",
    ", @xmath15 decreases very slowly up to @xmath5 20 gev and then starts to grow smoothly and monotonically ( without bumps or dips ) , as illustrated by the experimental points in figure [ fig:1 ] , in the case of @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering ( see also figure 41.10 in @xcite ) .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath15 is therefore a crucial point since , above the resonance region , it is directly related to the soft sector ( optical theorem ) giving information on the dynamics of the elastic interaction @xcite .",
    "although the rise of the total hadron - hadron cross sections at high energies is an experimental fact , the exact energy dependence involved has been a long - standing problem .",
    "several phenomenological models , with distinct physical pictures and good descriptions of the available data , make different asymptotic predictions @xcite and the only general , formal , widely accepted result is the well - known froissart - martin ( fm ) bound @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the squared center - of - mass energy , @xmath19 a constant , and a bound on the first term on the right - hand side , @xmath20 has been obtained by lukaszuk and martin @xcite .",
    "even recently , the foundations of this key result in soft hadronic physics have been discussed in the literature @xcite . in particular , azimov has presented a short critical review on the assumptions supporting the derivation of the bound @xcite .",
    "even depending on the unknown squared mass scale @xmath19 , the numerical values associated with the fm bound lie far above the existing data for the total cross section .",
    "for example , for @xmath19 in the interval 1 - 50 gev@xmath21 , the bound in ( [ eq:1]-[eq:2 ] ) at 1 tev is of order of 10 b , much larger than the 100 mb cross sections typically found in experiments at the highest energies .",
    "however , the bound also comprises a maximum rate of rise for the cross section with the energy , namely the squared logarithm behavior at the asymptotic energy region and that is the point we are interested in here .",
    "different dependencies have been extensively tested and discussed in the literature , specially in the context of amplitude analysis , which are characterized by analytical parametrization for the total cross section and fits to forward data .",
    "the most common functional forms employed in the highest - energy region include different combinations of constant , linear / quadratic logarithm dependencies and @xmath18 power laws , as discussed , for example , in @xcite and references therein .",
    "nonetheless , like the case of specific phenomenological models @xcite , these analyses present good descriptions of the available data with different functional forms and hence offer different physical pictures .",
    "new results from the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) and new estimates from the pierre auger observatory for the proton - proton total cross sections are expected to shed light on the subject , not only by selecting phenomenological models / pictures , but also by providing information on the degree of possible saturation of the bound in terms of the energy dependence of the cross section . in fact , at 7 tev the first result for the total cross section by the totem collaboration , a luminosity - dependent measurement @xcite , indicates consistency with a @xmath22 dependence , as predicted ten years ago by the parametrization that was ranked highest by the compete collaboration @xcite , also quoted in the review of particle physics by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "therefore , these results favor the maximum increase rate allowed by the bound .",
    "by contrast , at least two previous almost - model - independent analyses , based on data ensembles at lower energies , have indicated that the exponent in the logarithm may be somewhat larger than 2 @xcite . moreover , on the theoretical side , as recently discussed by azimov @xcite , it is not obvious if martin s derivation , in the context of axiomatic local quantum field theory , can be directly applied to hadronic processes .",
    "formal arguments suggest that the total cross section could grow faster than @xmath23 .",
    "a recent result from lattice qcd @xcite indicates an universal asymptotic squared logarithm dependence for the hadronic total cross section .",
    "that conclusion nonetheless rests on specific assumptions and is hence neither unique or exclusive .    in view of these facts",
    "the following question arises .",
    "taking into account the totem result and considering the exponent in the logarithm as a free fit parameter , the @xmath23 dependence is in fact a unique solution describing the asymptotic rise of the total cross section , or the data can be statistically described by another solution , rising faster ( or slower ) than @xmath23 ? to answer this question is the goal of this work .    for this purpose , we shall revisit the analytical parametrization introduced by amaldi _",
    "et al_. in the seventies @xcite , also employed by the ua4/2 collaboration , in the nineties @xcite , characterized by reggeon contributions at low energies and a leading contribution at high energies parametrized by a power law in @xmath24 , the real exponent @xmath0 as a free parameter .",
    "as will be recalled along the text , the two analyses cover different energy intervals and led to an exponent exceeding 2 . for future reference",
    ", we note that the above - mentioned highest - ranking parametrization , obtained by the compete collaboration @xcite , can be regarded as a particular instance of this parametrization in which the exponent was fixed at @xmath0 = 2 .",
    "all these works developed simultaneous fits to @xmath15 and the @xmath25 parameter ( ratio between the real and imaginary parts of the forward amplitude ) . here , for reasons to be discussed in detail",
    ", we shall analize only the @xmath15 data , from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering above @xmath26 = 5 gev . in order to investigate the effect of the recent experimental result for the @xmath1 total cross sections by the totem collaboration , we first consider all the previous existing data , covering the region up to 1.8 tev , and then add to the ensemble the data at 7 tev .",
    "we choose two different initial values for the free fit parameters and six fitting variants .",
    "we show that , with data up to 1.8 tev , the real exponent in the logarithm term is statistically consistent with @xmath0 = 2 , as predicted by the compete collaboration . however , with the addition of the data at 7 tev , the fits indicate exponents larger than 2 in all cases investigated .    the manuscript is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] we introduce the analytical parametrization , followed by some comments on its applicability and a critical discussion on the selected data ensemble . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present the fit procedures , variants and results . the conclusions and some final remarks are the contents of sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] .",
    "the class of analytical parametrization @xcite consists of two components for the total hadronic cross section associated with low- ( @xmath27 ) and high - energy ( @xmath28 ) contributions : @xmath29 the first term accounts for the decreasing of the total cross section and the differences between particle - particle and particle - antiparticle scattering at low energies and is expressed by @xmath30^{-b_1 } +   \\tau\\ , a_2\\ , \\left[\\frac{s}{s_l}\\right]^{-b_2 } , \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 = 1 gev@xmath21 ( fixed ) while @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 are free fit parameters , and @xmath36 the second term accounts for the rising of the cross section at higher energies and is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath0 , @xmath40 are real free parameters . for further discussion , let us briefly recall some formal aspects and previous results associated with this class of parametrization .    in the context of the regge - gribov theory all terms in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:4 ] ) and ( [ eq:5 ] ) have specific physical interpretations , namely reggeon and pomeron exchanges at low and high energy regions , respectively @xcite .",
    "the reggeons correspond to mesons resonances families with the adequate quantum numbers in the @xmath41-channel process and represented by trajectories interpolating the data on plots of spin @xmath42 versus the square of their masses ( chew - frautschi plot ) . in this case ,",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath35 correspond to the intercept of the trajectories and @xmath32 , @xmath34 the reggeon strengths ( residues ) . for @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering ,",
    "@xmath43 is associated with two reggeons , the first one with @xmath44 = + 1 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 mesons trajectories ) and the second with @xmath44 = - 1 ( @xmath25 and @xmath47 mesons trajectories ) , corresponding to @xmath48 = + 1 and @xmath48 = -1 , respectively .",
    "the type of pomeron contribution depends on the @xmath0 value . for @xmath0 = 1",
    ", the constant plus @xmath49 terms correspond to a double pole at @xmath42 = 1 and for @xmath0 = 2 a triple pole ( expressed by @xmath22 , @xmath49 and the constant terms ) . up to our knowledge ,",
    "the case of real exponent and 0 @xmath50 2 corresponds to a strong - coupling scenario ( critical pomeron ) @xcite and a fractional power , @xmath51 ( in general @xmath52 ) , is indicated by the mini - jet qcd model with infrared gluon resummation @xcite .",
    "as commented before , the above parametrization has been introduced by amaldi _",
    "et al_. @xcite , with @xmath43 expressed as function of the lab energy , @xmath53 as function of @xmath18 and with a fixed scale constant @xmath54 = 1 gev@xmath21 .",
    "simultaneous fits to @xmath15 and @xmath25 data ( via dispersion relations ) from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering in the interval 5 @xmath55 62 gev has lead to the result    @xmath0 = 2.10 @xmath56 0.10 .",
    "the same functional form was subsequently used by the ua4/2 collaboration @xcite .",
    "simultaneous fits to @xmath15 and @xmath25 data from @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering in a larger interval , 5 @xmath55 546 gev , have yielded the result    @xmath0 = 2.25@xmath57 .    more recently the compete collaboration has carried out a detailed and extensive study on possible analytic parametrizations including all measured @xmath15 and @xmath25 data from @xmath1 , @xmath2 , meson-@xmath58 scattering , among other processes , at @xmath59 4 gev and @xmath2 data up to 1.8 tev @xcite .",
    "different aspects of fit qualities have been considered in a ranking procedure with the same @xmath43 structure and @xmath53 parametrized either with @xmath0 = 1 or @xmath0 = 2 and the constant term .",
    "the parametrization with @xmath0 = 2 was ranked highest .",
    "as commented before , the predictions from this analysis , carried out 10 years ago , indicate consistency with the totem result at 7 tev and therefore agrees with the saturation of the squared logarithm dependence in the fm bound .",
    "two aspects of our choice of data ensemble deserve special atention .",
    "one aspect concerns the reactions and the other the physical quantities to be investigated , as discussed in what follows .",
    "first , the squared logarithm dependence in the fm bound is an asymptotic result , and the parametrization ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) covers particle - particle and particle - antiparticle interactions . for those reasons we shall consider only the cases with the _ highest energy interval in terms of available data _ , namely @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering . with this restrictive choice",
    "we do not take account of any constraint dictated by a supposed universal behavior , or data from other reactions in the region of intermediated and low energies , as for example the meson - proton cases .",
    "following amaldi _",
    "et al_. and the ua4/2 collaboration , we focus our analysis on data at @xmath59 5 gev@xmath21 .",
    "second , as we have commented before , amplitude analyses of the growth of the total cross section include information on the @xmath25 parameter , through dispersion relations ( integral and/or derivatives forms ) , or the asymptotic prescriptions for crossing even and odd amplitudes ( phragmn - lindelff theorem ) @xcite . with the exponent @xmath0 as a real free fitting parameter , the integral dispersion relations demand numerical methods and therefore require an specific approach for error propagation from the uncertainty in the @xmath0 parameter .",
    "the use of prescriptions seem to us unjustified in the region of intermediate and low energy data , since they are asymptotic results @xcite . by constrast",
    ", derivative dispersion relations allow an analytical approach and can be extended down to 4 - 5 gev @xcite or even below ( above the physical threshold ) in the form of a double infinite series @xcite or a single series @xcite . however , and that is a crucial point in this work , we shall not consider simultaneus fits to total cross section data and @xmath25 information for the six reasons that follows .    1 .   strictly speaking",
    "the @xmath25 parameter is not a quantity with the same physical status as the total cross section since , in practice , it is evaluated as a free fit parameter in the coulomb - nuclear interference region or inferred from analytical parametrization @xcite .",
    "as the energy grows , it becomes progressively more difficult to determine @xmath25 @xcite and therefore the associated uncertainty , as can be easily seen in plots of this parameter in terms of the energy .",
    "even the compete collaboration refers to the difficulty to adequately fit the @xmath25 data from @xmath1 scattering @xcite .",
    "simultaneous fits to total cross section data and @xmath25 parameter demand the use of dispersion relations with one subtraction @xcite and therefore one more parameter , the subtraction constant .",
    "however this constant does not have a physical interpretation , constrasting therefore with all the parameters in the @xmath15 parametrization ( shortly discussed in section [ subsec:2.1 ] ) .",
    "4 .   in data reductions ,",
    "the correlation of the subtraction constant with all the other ( physical ) parameters affects the fit results at both low- and high - energy regions , as discussed in detail in @xcite . as a consequence , the presence or not of",
    "the subtraction constant may lead to different results . in this respect",
    "we note that , although referred to in @xcite the value of the subtraction constant is not given ( null or neglected ? ) , in @xcite its fit value is @xmath60 57 @xmath56 4 and it is neglected in the prescriptions or derivative dispersion relations used by the compete collaboration @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that even the prediction of the @xmath25 parameter from fits to total cross section data is affected by the presence or not of the subtraction constant @xcite .",
    "5 .   as recently demonstrated by ferreira @xcite and collaborators @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the different slopes associated with the real and imaginary parts of the hadronic amplitude in the coulomb - nuclear interference region , affect the extracted value of the @xmath25 parameter .",
    "this effect , however , has never been considered in the experimental procedures used in the @xmath25 determination .",
    "the limited validity of the relative phase between coulomb and nuclear amplitudes , used in the experimental procedures to determine @xmath25 , has also been discussed by kundrt , lokajek and vrko @xcite .",
    "6 .   as a consequence of the above mentioned effects and the increasing uncertainty in the @xmath25 determination with the energy , any possible deviation from an analytical parametrization for the total cross section , dictated by the experimental data at the highest energies , may be hidden or lost .",
    "in other words , the inclusion of the @xmath25 information may erroneously anchor the rise of the total cross section at the highest energies .",
    "these six critical points suggest that , at the high - energy region , fits restricted to the total cross section data may avoid the bias introduced by both the @xmath25 parameter and the subtraction constant embodied in the dispersion relations .",
    "therefore , although not being a usual procedure in amplitude analysis , we understand that to explore the possibility of focusing our fits only on the total cross section data constitute , at least , a valid strategy .",
    "for that reason our data sample comprises only the @xmath1 and @xmath2 total cross section data above 5 gev @xcite , including in special , the recent totem result at 7 tev @xcite .",
    "two points must be stressed in the analysis that follows : [ i ] we are concerned only with the rate of increase of the total cross section , not with the numerical value of the fm bound ; [ ii ] our data ensemble is only a subset of the data employed in the global analysis by the compete collaboration .",
    "by means of a luminosity - dependent method the totem collaboration has recently obtained for the @xmath1 total cross section at 7 tev the value @xmath61 = 98.3 @xmath56 0.2@xmath62 @xmath56 2.8@xmath63 mb @xcite .",
    "our point here is to investigate the effect of this new data in the previous analytical fits covering the energy interval 5 gev @xmath64 1.8 tev , as was the case with the compete collaboration .",
    "based on the results by amaldi _",
    "et al_. and by the ua4/2 collaboration , our strategy amounts to using the parametrization ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) to investigate possible deviations from @xmath0 = 2 .    however , several aspects related to fitting procedure and the alternatives allowed by physical considerations or assumptions deserve investigation . the three main points concern : ( 1 )",
    "the nonlinearity of the fit demands a methodology for the choice of the initial ( feedback ) values of the free parameters @xcite ; ( 2 ) as commented in sect .",
    "[ subsec:2.1 ] , in the theoretical context the intercepts @xmath33 and @xmath35 are expected to be consistent with spectroscopic data ( chew - frautschi plot ) ; ( 3 ) fixing @xmath33 and @xmath35 affects the fit results in both low- and high - energy regions , due to the correlation among the free parameters . in order to address these points the following methodology and fit variants have been considered .    in all cases under study",
    "we first consider the ensemble in the interval 5 gev @xmath65 1.8 tev and after that we include the data at 7 tev from the totem collaboration .",
    "for easier reference we will denote these two ensembles by @xmath3 = 1.8 tev and @xmath3 = 7 tev , respectively . in order to investigate the effects of different choices for the initial values of the free parameters , we have followed two alternative procedures , named method 1 and method 2 :    _ method 1 .",
    "_    since the highest rank result by the compete collaboration predicts a @xmath23 dependence and is consistent with the totem result at 7 tev , we consider as a kind of orthodox choice to initialize our parametric set with the central values they have obtained in the simultaneous fit to @xmath15 and @xmath25 data , which includes @xmath1 , @xmath2 in the interval 5 gev @xmath65 1.8 tev as a subset .",

    "all these cases have been excluded .",

    "the results for the @xmath3 = 1.8 tev ensemble , listed in tables [ tab:1 ] and [ tab:3 ] , are statistically consistent with @xmath0 = 2 , which points to a saturation of the squared logarithm dependence for the total cross section at high energies .",
    "more specifically , the results can be summarized as follows :    : :    method 1 ( table [ tab:1 ] ) : @xmath75 2.00    @xmath56 0.03 ( v1 ) and @xmath75 2.08    @xmath56 0.10 ( v3 ) .",

    "on the other hand , when the more recent 7 tev totem data is included , all fits with @xmath0 as a free parameter , listed in tables [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:4 ] , are statistically consistent with exponents above 2 , as indicated in the following summary :    : :    method 1 ( table [ tab:2 ] ) : @xmath75 2.10    @xmath56 0.03 ( v1 ) and @xmath75 2.27    @xmath56 0.04 ( v3 ) . : :    method 2 ( table [ tab:4 ] ) : @xmath75 2.21    @xmath56 0.02 ( v5 ) and @xmath75 2.10    @xmath56 0.11 ( v6 ) .",
    "all these results for @xmath0 , together with those obtained by amaldi _ et al_. and the ua/4 collaboration , are schematically displayed in figure [ fig:8 ] . from our data reductions through parametrization ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) to @xmath1 and @xmath2 scattering above 5 gev , including the 7 tev totem result , we conclude that the total hadronic cross section may rise faster than @xmath23 at high energies .    from figure [ fig:8 ] , we see that the central values of the @xmath0 parameter from the fits with @xmath3 = 1.8 tev ( methods 1 and 2 ) are below the corresponding values obtained by amaldi _",
    "et al_. and by the ua4/2 collaboration .",
    "since these authors have included the @xmath25 information in their analysis , it seems not clear that simultaneous fits to @xmath25 and @xmath15 data may , in that case , anchor the rise of the total cross section . in other words , we understand that the results we have obtained with @xmath3 = 1.8 tev and @xmath3 = 7 tev ensembles are not connected with the inclusion or not of the @xmath25 information , but are direct consequences of the total cross section data analyzed and the possibility to treat @xmath0 as a free fit parameter ( not fixed to 2 ) .",
    "in fact , our _ predictions _ for @xmath76 in the case of @xmath772 are presented in appendix [ app : a ] and show good agreement with experimental information available above 5 gev .",
    "concerning the rise of the total cross section faster than the squared logarithm dependence , we have the following final comments :    \\1 . in the theoretical context , different assumptions on the nonphysical amplitudes in the asymptotic region",
    "can explain this behavior , which does not mean violation of unitarity , as recently discussed by azimov @xcite .",
    "\\2 . in the experimental context , beyond the lhc energy region ,",
    "extremely large uncertainties are associated with estimations of the @xmath1 total cross section from cosmic - ray experiments .",
    "such uncertainties are unavoidable since the flux decreases as the energy grows and because the extraction of @xmath78 from @xmath79 is model dependent .",
    "these estimations have been included in our figures for qualitative comparison only .",
    "it may be useful to recall that the the results of the akeno collaboration @xcite have been criticized in several works , as discussed for example in refs . @xcite and @xcite , and references therein .",
    "had we ignored this information , the fly s eye and auger results , i.e. , the highest - energy points in our figures , might suggest a different scenario for the rise of the total cross section .",
    "in fact , from figures [ fig:1 ] to [ fig:7 ] , all the curves in consistency with the totem data lie above the central values of these cosmic - ray estimations and the same is true in the inverse sense .",
    "that is , _ there is no agreement among the totem result and the fly s eye and auger estimations , at least in what concerns parametrization _ ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) . in this sense ,",
    "the expected measurement of @xmath15 by the totem collaboration at 7 and 8 tev through the luminosity - independent @xcite method may shed light on the subject .",
    "moreover , new experimental results on elastic and diffractive scattering at 8 tev ( and , subsequently , at 14 tev ) , will provide novel phenomenological insights and reduce the uncertainties from model extrapolations necessary to obtain @xmath15 from cosmic - ray experiments ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    at last we stress that our approach and strategies do not follow the usual or standard lines of the amplitude analyses on the energy dependence of the total cross section . as commented , the latter include @xmath25 data , associate the parametrization with data at low energies and constrain the fits to describe other reactions , for which low - energy data are available .",
    "these are aspects that we expect to consider in a future work , since they may provide information that is complementary to the results we have presented . as commented along the manuscript , our goal has been to explore the possibility of investigating only the reactions with highest energy interval available , concentrating on the total cross section data .",
    "we have tried to identify possible high - energy effects that may be unrelated to the trends of the lower - energy data ( including those from other reactions ) or hidden in fits including the @xmath25 information .",
    "our intention is not to compete with other authors or analysis , but to call the attention to the possibility that the rise of the total hadronic cross section may still constitute an open problem , an assertion that contrasts with the view advocated by some authors @xcite .",
    "_ note added during revision _    after this paper was submitted to publication , new fits of forward quantities were obtained by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the updated data set includes the totem result at 7 tev and the new fit with the highest rank compete parametrization ( @xmath80 ) shows that the point at 7 tev is not described : the curve lies below the data ( figure 46.10 in @xcite ) .",
    "this result corroborates those already shown with the @xmath3 = 7 tev ensemble in our figures [ fig:1 ] , [ fig:3 ] and [ fig:5 ] .",
    "we are thankful to an anonymous referee for valuable comments .",
    "this research was supported by the fapesp under contracts 11/15016 - 4 , 11/00505 - 0 and 09/50180 - 0 .",
    "in this appendix we present predictions for @xmath76 from fits to @xmath1 and @xmath2 total cross section data through parametrization ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) with @xmath81 .",
    "we also discuss the effect and role of the subtraction constant , embodied in the associated dispersion relation . in search of extreme effects",
    "we shall consider the two results obtained with the @xmath3 = 7 tev ensemble , which correspond to the highest exponents @xmath0 , namely      in terms of the _ forward _ scattering amplitude @xmath82 , the total cross section ( optical theorem ) and the ratio between the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude , at high energies , can be expressed by                  the real and imaginary parts of the even and odd amplitudes are connected by dispersion relations and the high - energy domain demands one subtraction @xcite .",
    "since we are looking for analytical results , we shall work here with the derivative dispersion relations in the standard form deduced by bronzan , kane and sukhatme @xcite .",
    "they are obtained from the integral dispersion relations in the high - energy limit :            @xmath92\\frac{\\textrm{im}\\ f_{-}(s)}{s } \\right\\ } d\\ln s \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{2}{\\pi}\\int \\left\\ { \\left [ 1 - \\frac{1}{3 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d}{d \\ln s}\\right)^2 - \\frac{1}{45 } \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{2}\\frac{d}{d \\ln s}\\right)^4   - \\dots \\right ] \\frac{\\textrm{im}\\ f_{-}(s)}{s } \\right\\ } d \\ln s. \\label{eq:11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with parametrization ( [ eq:3]-[eq:5 ] ) taken as input , a closed form results from the sum of the contributions associated with the power - law term @xmath43 .",
    "the sum of the contributions from the logarithm term @xmath53 converges fast for @xmath0 in the range ( 2.2 - 2.3 ) and a third - order approximation is therefore sufficient .",
    "we obtain for the even part    @xmath93^{-b_1 } + a\\ln^{\\gamma - 1}\\left(\\frac{s}{s_h}\\right ) + \\nonumber \\\\ & & b\\ln^{\\gamma - 3}\\left(\\frac{s}{s_h}\\right ) + c\\ln^{\\gamma - 5}\\left(\\frac{s}{s_h}\\right ) , \\label{eq:12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath94 ^ 3 \\ , \\beta\\ , \\gamma\\ , [ \\gamma - 1 ] [ \\gamma - 2 ] , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we follow two alternatives : in the first we fix it at @xmath100 ; in the second we let @xmath90 be a fit parameter to the @xmath25 data only . more specifically , we take as input the parameters in tables [ tab:2 ] and [ tab:4 ] , with @xmath31 = 1 gev@xmath21 . in the first alternative , @xmath101",
    ", we obtain the direct prediction for @xmath76 . in the second alternative",

    ": :    even in these extrema cases , with @xmath102 , all    the experimental information on @xmath96 and    @xmath97 above 5 gev are quite well    described ; 2 . : :    the subtraction constant affects the low - energy results , below    @xmath103 20 gev ; 3 .",
    ": :    the best @xmath71/dof results ( closest to 1 ) are obtained    with @xmath90 as a free fit parameter .",
    "obviously , that is a    consequence of adding one more free parameter , however without the    physical interpretation associated with those present in the    parametrization of the total cross section .",
    "finally , we recall that in simultaneous fit to @xmath15 and @xmath25 the subtraction constant affects both the low- and high - energy regions @xcite .",
