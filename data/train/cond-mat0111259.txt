    "the initial interest in light - emitting si - based nanostructures has lead to a number of important experiments establishing that si / sio@xmath0 superlattices ( sls ) show enhanced , blue - shifted luminescence .",
    "@xcite while the luminescence pattern is more complex in these systems than in others , the blue shift was found to correlate with decreasing si - layer thickness .",
    "this simple relation between the silicon - layer thickness and the luminescence peak is of great interest for applications such as si - based light - emitting diodes ( ) . all reported sl energy peaks are in the lower part of the visible spectrum  the highest reported value being ( 540 nm ) , i.e. , green,@xcite and the lowest ( 1030 nm ) , in the near infrared.@xcite these sls are really multiple si quantum wells ( mqw ) , the silicon oxide layers playing the role of barriers .",
    "the thickness of the si quantum wells , @xmath1 , is the critical parameter .",
    "a fixed @xmath1 would simply set the colour of the , while mqws with a range of @xmath1 would span a range of colours in the luminescence .",
    "other systems containing confined silicon structures ( besides mqws ) are , e.g. , porous si@xcite ( consisting of quasi one - dimensional structures ) , silicon nanoclusters in sio@xmath0 matrices,@xcite nanocrystals@xcite or dislocation loops , and quantum - dot structures made from implantation of boron@xcite or other ions.@xcite the choice of a particular structure , e.g. , for applications , depends on many factors : stability over time , optical efficiency at room temperature , experimental reproductiveness , facility to accept or type dopants ( e.g. , for n - p junctions ) , ease of incorporation in ultra - large - scale - integration technology , and production costs .",
    "sls are stable structures , as opposed to porous - si .",
    "in addition , the silicon layer thicknesses in sls are directly related to the energy peaks in the si / sio@xmath0 luminescence spectra .",
    "this is not straighforward in porous silicon , si clusters or nanocrystals , where pore dimensions as well as hydrogen concentrations play an uncontrolled role on the energy shift.@xcite    silicon - based structures have many advantages over structures made of other semiconductors : low - cost ( as compared to any of the or ) , non - toxicity , practically unlimited availability ( in contrast to germanium ) and benefits from decades of experience in purification , growth , and device fabrication .",
    "however , the indirect energy gap ( ) in bulk crystalline silicon ( ) makes it unsuitable for optoelectronic applications .",
    "silica ( sio@xmath0 ) is another key material of the microelectronics industry ; it has a bandgap of .",
    "optical - fiber technologies and metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets ) are based on ( high - quality ) silica .",
    "molecular - beam epitaxy and chemical vapor deposition provide the needed growth technology for si and sio@xmath0 .",
    "it is possible to combine crystalline silicon@xcite and sio@xmath0 to produce structured materials having chemically pure , sharp , defect - free interfaces .",
    "the degree of advancement of the fabrication technology is such that the enhanced luminescence in sls can not be explained only in terms of defects@xcite and/or residual hydrogen atoms filling unsaturated si dangling bonds  the latter being referred to as @xmath2-type centers@xcite  located at the sl interfaces , as in the well - understood enhanced luminescence of hydrogenated _ a-_si .",
    "the objective of the present article is to consider the detailed microscopic structure of the double interface structure and provide a first - principles understanding of the emission of light from sls . only a few atomistic dft calculations on sls",
    "have been reported.@xcite many more would have been available were it not of the ( naturally - occuring ) amorphous structure of sio@xmath0 : amorphous structures require large supercells to get physically relevant results .",
    "another important issue is the need to model the si / sio@xmath0 interface so as to correctly incorporate the known experimental details .",
    "recent core - level shift measurements@xcite provide details of the suboxide ( partially oxidized ) si atoms.@xcite further , the abruptness of the si / sio@xmath0 interface has been established from transmission electronic microscopy ( tem ) experiments ; values of the interface width as low as 5   have been reported.@xcite based on these observations , realistic si / sio@xmath0 interface models have been designed by several workers.@xcite suboxide si atoms in most of these models are distributed within three atomic layers of the si / sio@xmath0 interface , corresponding to the lowest experimental interface thickness .",
    "such interface models are needed for first - principles modelling of mosfets , and for sl structures , where _ multiple _ si / sio@xmath0 interfaces are present .    an early ( and tractable ) si / sio@xmath0 interface model was proposed by herman and batra.@xcite the large lattice mismatch between sio@xmath0 and si was accommodated by setting the sio@xmath0 unit cell diagonally on the diamond - like unit cell .",
    "an oxygen atom was included in the interface to saturate the dangling bonds , resulting in a crystalline model of the interface .",
    "another simple crystalline model , involving a bridge oxygen at the interface , was introduced by tit and dharma - wardana.@xcite these models were studied using a variety of methods  tight - binding ( tb),@xcite full - potential , linear - muffin - tin - orbitals ( fp - lmto)@xcite and linearized - augmented - plane - waves ( fp - lapw).@xcite the dispersionless character of the bandstructure in the growth axis has been confirmed within all three theoretical approaches , thus demonstrating the existence of strong confinement .",
    "however , the nature of the energy gap  from both lmto and lapw calculations  is still indirect .",
    "furthermore , these crystalline models show that the light absorption is quite dependent on the details of bonding and interface structure ( bondlengths , angles and chemical species ) , emphasizing the need for _ more realistic _ , _ structurally - relaxed _",
    "models.@xcite    several structurally - relaxed models have been investigated by kageshima and shiraishi using first - principles methods .",
    "their models were constructed starting from @xmath3-cristobalite as well as @xmath4-quartz sio@xmath0 layers superposed onto c - si layers with different possibilities for the si / sio@xmath0 interface ( such as hydrogen atoms at dangling bonds);@xcite the atomic sites were then structurally relaxed .",
    "the calculations indicate that the energy gaps are indeed direct , and that interfacial si ",
    "oh bonds are possible candidates for the light - emitting enhancement in sls",
    ". however , the models are not consistent with the observed suboxide si atomic distributions at the si(001)/sio@xmath0 interfaces .",
    "for instance , no si atoms bonded to three oxygens are present .",
    "tit and dharma - wardana@xcite have constructed a partially - relaxed model ( prm ) starting from a structurally relaxed si(001)/sio@xmath0 interface structure due to pasquarello , hybertsen , and car ( phc).@xcite this interface model contains all three suboxide si atomic species .",
    "hydrogen atoms were used by phc to terminate the surface . in the tit and dharma - wardana model ,",
    "the h atoms were removed and the si / sio@xmath0 interface structure was converted into a sio@xmath0/si / sio@xmath0 double interface sl structure while preserving local tetrahedral bonding to obtain the prm structure . within the tb approach ,",
    "the energy gap of the prm was shown to be direct and enhancement of the optical absorption ( as compared to c - si ) was confirmed.@xcite this is further described in the next section , since the fully relaxed models ( frms ) discussed in the present work are based on this prm .",
    "the results presented here go beyond the tb approach and were obtained within the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) theoretical framework .",
    "a brief description of the theory is given in section [ compdet ] .",
    "the sl models were all structurally relaxed , and contain no hydrogen atoms at the interfaces .",
    "the interface suboxide si atoms observed in experiment@xcite arise naturally in the model .",
    "calculations were carried out for different si - layer thicknesses , in order to assess the effect of confinement on the electronic and optical properties .",
    "supplementary models have been constructed to clarify the role of the suboxide atoms on the sl optical properties .",
    "we first review the theoretical methods ( section [ compdet ] ) , then focus on the four central issues needed to understand the si / sio@xmath0 luminescence properties : construction of realistic interface models ( section  [ ionic ] ) , quantum confinement ( section  [ confinement ] ) , role of the suboxide atoms ( section  [ interface ] ) , and optical effects associated with increased confinement ( section  [ blueshift ] ) .",
    "our study thus provides a complete , microscopic picture of the luminescence properties of si / sio@xmath0 sls .",
    "the electronic - structure calculations were carried out using the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite using the `` frozen - core '' paw approach.@xcite the overall framework is density - functional theory@xcite ( dft ) within the local - density approximation ( lda).@xcite    the `` frozen - core '' paw is a simpler form of the general paw method introduced by blchl.@xcite blchl s method is an extension of the usual lapw@xcite approach .",
    "hence , the paw method formally bridges the lapw to the ultrasoft - pseudopotentials ( us - pp ) in order to combine the precision of the former and the rapidity ( for larger systems ) of the latter .",
    "the paw method has another advantage over the usual implementation of us - pp , essential for optical calculations : it avoids correcting for spatial nonlocality effects in typical pseudopotentials when evaluating the momentum operator * p*. further details can be found in the article of adolph _ et al_.@xcite    matrix elements of the momentum operator * p * are needed for calculating interband optical effects .",
    "we describe the main steps that lead to the calculation of the absorption coefficient , starting from paw solutions of the kohn - sham equations .",
    "the paw approach rests on the following linear transformation : @xmath5 this relates the ( calculated ) pseudo wave function @xmath6 to the ( now corrected ) all - electrons wave function @xmath7 .",
    "the index specifies the atomic site , angular momentum numbers and reference energy .",
    "the two functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are respectively the pseudo , and all - electron wave function of a reference atom .",
    "they are forced to overlap outside a given core region .",
    "the functions @xmath10 are the _ projector _ functions characteristic of the paw method .",
    "thus , the three functions @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 constitute the frozen - core paw data , being set prior to self - consistent field calculations .",
    "the projector functions @xmath10 are constructed so as to remain dual to the pseudo wave functions , to fulfill generalized orthogonality constraints and to remain ( approximately ) complete ( see ref .   for full definitions ) .",
    "the application of the above linear transformation to any operator @xmath11 within the paw approach has been described by blchl [ cf .",
    "11 ) of ref .  ]",
    ". if @xmath11 is the momentum operator * p * ( in a certain direction defined by the polarization vector ) , we have @xmath12 the imaginary part of the dielectric function , @xmath13 , can be determined by using the fermi golden rule within the coulomb gauge ; the expression becomes:@xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath16 is the fermi distribution and @xmath17 are the paw matrix elements .",
    "the whole expression corresponds to the probability per unit volume for a transition of an electron from the valence band state @xmath7 to the conduction band state @xmath18 to occur .",
    "the tetrahedron method@xcite is used to evaluate @xmath19 .",
    "the joint density of states , which determines the interband transitions @xmath20 and the optical matrix elements @xmath21 , are computed on each tetrahedron ( i.e. , 1/4 @xmath22 the sum of the matrix elements on the four corners of each tetrahedron ) . the real part @xmath23 is then obtained using the kramers - kronig relation.@xcite since the dielectric function is the square of the complex refractive index , @xmath24 , the absorption coefficient becomes @xmath25^{1/2}\\ ] ] with @xmath26 the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath27 planck s constant , and @xmath28 the photon energy .",
    "electron - hole ( e - h , excitonic ) interactions were not included in the calculations , as they would be in , say , solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "the size of our systems prohibits such complete optical calculations , which are feasible only for very small systems ( a few atoms ) .",
    "these additional effects would enhance the results from interband transitions since e - h interactions generally increase the absorption at the onset.@xcite",
    "recent core - level shift experiments@xcite have revealed the presence of all possible oxidation states for si atoms in si / sio@xmath0 structures such as sls , that is si@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the charge found within each si wigner - seitz sphere . si@xmath31 and si@xmath32 are the charge states of si found in bulk - si and bulk - sio@xmath0 . the suboxide ( subo ) si atoms with @xmath33 are found at the interface .",
    "slightly larger distributions for the subo si@xmath34 densities , as compared to those for si@xmath35 and si@xmath36 , were reported in these experiments .",
    "microscopic si / sio@xmath0 interface models should be consistent with experiments in closely reproducing the density distributions of _ all _ subo si atoms .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the si / sio@xmath0 sl model structures discussed in the present article are based on the si(001)/sio@xmath0 interface structures obtained by phc,@xcite who used the car - parrinello method to relax the models to their energy minima .",
    "it is important to note that the phc models were _ not _ designed for the double interface structure found in sio@xmath0/si / sio@xmath0 sls but , rather , for a single si / sio@xmath0 interface which terminates into the vacuum ; this is done by saturating dangling bonds with h atoms .",
    "thus , these models _ de facto _ contain the essential details of atomic positions and charge states at the si / sio@xmath0 interface .",
    "tit and dharma - wardana@xcite have generated a si / sio@xmath0 sl structure starting from one of the phc models that contains an _ equal _ distribution of the three subo atoms , in ( almost complete ) accord with experiment .",
    "this sl model has been constructed by first operating a mirror transformation and then a partial rotation of the si / sio@xmath0 section of the relaxed interface structure , leading to an intermediate si / sio@xmath37$]sio@xmath0/si sl structure .",
    "second , some of the si layers were inverted in order to meet the @xmath38-bonding topology .",

    "[ modelsl ] .",
    "the letters @xmath11 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 correspond to silicon atomic layers , while the @xmath43s are oxygen layers .",

    "the subo si@xmath29 atoms , with @xmath33 , are distributed within only two si layers , while the si@xmath31 atoms are distributed within five atomic layers .",
    "the embryonic phc interface model corresponds roughly to one side of the above configuration , starting from the arrow up to the right .",
    "of course , this construction induces artificial symmetries in the middle of the sio@xmath0 layer ( more precisely , upon and around the @xmath44 $ ] layer ) ; this model is thus in essence _ partially _ relaxed  the prm referred to earlier .",
    "significant information on the electronic and optical properties of this model have been extracted , within the tb approach , by tit and dharma - wardana,@xcite who obtained direct energy gaps as well as dispersionless bandstructures .",
    "furthermore , the imaginary part of the dielectric function was calculated , and then the absorption coefficient was deduced . from this calculation , enhancement of absorption as well as blueshift with confinement have been demonstrated.@xcite    the next obvious step is to relax the prm , i.e. , determine the set of positions which leads , via the hellman - feynman forces , to the lowest total energy .",
    "we have used the paw approach described in the previous section to obtain a first fully - relaxed model ( frm1 ) , which contains approximately one unit cell of confined - si .",
    "the supercell contains 52 si and 44 o atoms , and has dimensions .",
    "the relaxation procedure has been performed with five * k * points in the reduced brillouin zone ( bz ) .",
    "the energy cutoff was 25.96 ryd in all calculations .",
    "the total energy was found to decrease by 30.84 ev ( 0.32 ev per atom ) during relaxation .",

    "the shaded boxes in fig .",
    "[ prm2frm ] are the distributions of the interface subo si atoms , while the empty boxes are the total distribution bondlengths , including subo si atoms ; the shaded boxes remain relatively unchanged upon relaxation since both interfaces were already at their energy minimum , after phc .",

    "interfacial si ",
    "o bondlengths of all subo si atoms depart from the values of si@xmath32 in the sio@xmath0 layer .",
    "the broadening of the si ",
    "si bondlengths is in general much larger than that of si  o ; the distortion of the bondlengths are thus mainly within the si layer and at the si / sio@xmath0 interface , i.e. , not inside the silica layer .",
    "this is further discussed below .",
    "the resulting frm1 is shown in fig .",
    "[ modelsl ] .",
    "additional models having thicker si wells were constructed in order to examine the role of subo si layers and the effect of confinement on the electronic and optical properties . as noted earlier , the frm1 structure contains approximately one unit cell of confined - si , i.e. , the set of layers with charge state si@xmath48 ( bulk - like si ) . by inserting one , then two , additional @xmath49 si atomic planes ( i.e. , one si unit cell , thickness 5.43  ) , and relaxing all atoms , we generated two additional models ",
    "frm2 and frm3 .",
    "the frm2 contains 68 si atoms while the frm3 has 84 si atoms ; both have 44 oxygen atoms , as in the frm1 .",
    "energy variation for the frm2 during relaxation was found to be only 0.15 ev ( i.e. , 0.0013 ev / atom ) while for the frm3 , this change is a minuscule 0.051 ev ( i.e. , 0.00040 ev / atom ) .",
    "these numbers imply that both frm2 and frm3 have essentially crystalline si layers .",
    "the frm2 has nine si@xmath31 atomic planes while the frm3 has thirteen .",
    "figure [ couches ] shows the distributions of the si ",
    "si bondlengths in the frm3 , starting from the si(001)/sio@xmath0 interfaces ( at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ couches ] ) and going towards the centre of the silicon layer along the growth axis . the standard deviation ( @xmath50 ) from the mean value ( @xmath51=2.34   in all atomic layers except at the interface , where @xmath51=2.29  ) is also given .",
    "the diamond - shaped symbols correspond to the si ",
    "si bondlengths for si@xmath48 atoms while the filled circles are subo si ",
    "si bondlengths at the interfaces .",
    "si bondlengths depart significantly from their crystalline counterparts at the interfaces up to about three atomic layers , where @xmath50=0.019 ; the standard deviation is four times higher at the interfaces than in the fifth atomic layer .",
    "this deviation of the bondlengths at the si / sio@xmath0 interfaces shows that it is important to take relaxation aspects into account .",
    "indeed , amorphous sio@xmath0 layers in realistic sls induce strain and disorder in the si layer , as confirmed in fig .",
    "[ couches ] .",
    "this effect could generate localized defects giving rise to efficient radiative electron - hole recombination .",
    "however , the strain fields only contribute to the small _ quasi - momenta _ regime and can not easily supply the momentum deficit involved in the indirect transition of c - si .",
    "moreover , the relatively small size of our supercell models in the @xmath52-@xmath53 directions prevents firm conclusions being drawn about the influence of this strain on the optical properties .",
    "further aspects of the role of interfaces are discussed in section [ interface ] .",
    "the three subo si configurations at the interfaces of the frms are shown in fig .",
    "[ tetra ] with their corresponding bondlengths .",
    "note that the left and right interfaces in the sio@xmath0/si / sio@xmath0 sls are not _ exactly _ equivalent ; they remain independent ( during structural relaxation , for instance ) .",
    "however , a subo si on the left interface has a locally equivalent subo si on the right interface , by construction . as a consequence , each pair of equivalent subo si atoms have approximately the same bondlengths and angles in all the frms . as seen in fig .",
    "[ tetra ] , the bondlengths depart from their bulk values , which are 2.35   for c - si and 1.61   for sio@xmath0 . in addition , the angles of the subo si tetrahedra vary considerably : the si  si  si angles vary from 99@xmath54 to 125@xmath54 , the o ",
    "si angles vary from 96@xmath54 to 126@xmath54 , while all o ",
    "si  o angles remain around 106@xmath54 .",
    "it is thus clear that the subo si tetrahedra at the interfaces are distorted as compared to bulk - si tetrahedra .    as discussed later on , the role of subo si atoms",
    "was further studied using the following variations of the frm2 : first , we removed all si@xmath32 atoms and attached the proper number of hydrogen atoms to neutralize the excess charges .",
    "the h positions were then relaxed while keeping all the silicon and oxygen atoms fixed .",
    "this structure thus contains si@xmath48 atoms and si@xmath29 subos , where @xmath33 ( i.e. , @xmath55 ) .",
    "a variation of this structure was generated by removing all oxygen atoms and filling the si dangling bonds with h atoms , and again relaxing the h atoms .",
    "the final si - h bondlengths vary from 1.47   to 1.53  , after relaxation .",
    "this final structure is thus subo - free and contains only si@xmath31 atoms , except at the interface with the vacuum , where hydrogen atoms fill the dangling bonds .",
    "these three confinement models are shown in fig .",
    "[ confinmod ] ; they will be referred to as `` frm2 '' , `` frm2/o - h / vacuum '' and `` frm2/h / vacuum '' , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ bzcsi ] we show the bz of the supercell , the standard c - si diamond bz , and the high symmetry axes used for the bandstructure calculations .",
    "we also constructed the bulk c - si structure in a supercell of dimensions similar to that of the frm sls , so that comparisons can be done within the same * k * space zone scheme .",
    "this will be used in the next three sections for comparisons of bandstructure as well as absorption calculations .",
    "in this section , we discuss the nature of the confined states in the sls .",
    "we calculated the bandstructures of the three sl models  frm1 , frm2 and frm3  as well as the supplementary frm2/o - h / vacuum structure , cf.fig .",
    "[ confinmod](b ) .",
    "the latter is the `` ultimate '' in terms of confinement , as the two interfaces with vacuum constitute infinite potential walls .",
    "all bandstructures are analysed and compared within equivalent supercell bz .",
    "the growth axis of the sls being the @xmath56-axis , confinement effects are expected to take place in the and axis of the bz ( see fig .",
    "[ bzcsi ] for axis definitions ) .",
    "the bandstructures of the three sls and their total density of states ( dos ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ bands ] .",
    "we find that the bandstructures in the growth axis ( @xmath57-@xmath58 and @xmath59-@xmath60 ) are dispersionless , for all models and all energies . in physical terms , dispersionless bandstructures imply infinite effective masses , reflecting the strong confinement .",
    "the dos have a more abrupt variation in the valence bands than in the conduction bands .",
    "however , dos alone are not enough to fully understand the optical processes involving the interband transitions , since the weighting of the optical matrix elements is needed .",
    "this is further discussed in section [ blueshift ] .",
    "let us consider in more details one of the sl models , namely the frm2 .",
    "we select the high - symmetry axis where the major features , viz .",
    "the relevant energy gaps , appear .",
    "the bandstructures of the folded c - si structure , the frm2 sls structure as well as the frm2/o - h / vacuum structure have been calculated and compared .",
    "figure [ bandsioh](a ) and [ bandsioh](b ) contain a synopsis of all calculations for * k * points along .",
    "several conclusions can be drawn from these figures .    by comparing the bands for c - si , fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](a ) , with those for the frm2 sl , fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](b ) ( solid lines ) , we see that folding effects can not by themselves explain the new band - structure .",
    "the bands in the directions are totally modified by the confinement .",
    "although c - si always has an optically indirect bandgap , this bandgap becomes almost direct in its folded configuration , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](a ) , while for the sl the bandgap is _ unequivocally _ direct , and significantly increased . moreover , comparing the bands in a direction orthogonal to the growth axis , for instance around @xmath61 in both fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](a ) and fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](b ) , we see that the valence bands are raised ; the lowest conduction band in the direction is pushed to higher energies .",
    "in addition , they exhibit less dispersion in the sl than in c - si , in general .",
    "hence , confinement modifies the electronic properties in the growth axis as well as in directions orthogonal to it .",
    "this is further analysed from optical absorption calculations , below .",
    "we compare in fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](b ) the bandstructures of the frm2 and frm2/o - h / vacuum models .",
    "the positions of the si@xmath48 atoms , as well as the subo si in the two structures , are identical .",
    "the solid lines displays the bandstructures of the frm2 , while the dots display the bands of the frm2/o - h / vacuum structure .",
    "it is clear that the two bandstructures are nearly identical .",
    "this calculation shows that the sio@xmath0 layers act as virtually impenetrable barriers .",
    "the electronic properties of hypothetical sl structures having only subo si ",
    "i.e. , no si@xmath32 of sio@xmath0  and positioned at the subo si sites , would give nearly identical electronic properties as si / sio@xmath0 sls , for energies close to the band gap .",
    "our calculations show that the electronic wavefunctions die out at the suboxide si atoms of the interfaces .",
    "thus the barrier is sharply located just behind the subo si atoms , and therefore just two atomic layers could be used as a barrier without altering the electronic properties , when energies involved ( in the device ) remain close to the energy gap .",
    "the influence of the interface subo si atoms is further analysed next .",
    "in order to assess the role of the subo ions on the electronic properties , we calculated the bandstructures of the frm2/h / vacuum structure , fig .",
    "[ confinmod](c ) , which contains _ no _ subo si ; the dangling bonds have been filled by hydrogen atoms and hydrogen atoms ( only ) have been structurally relaxed .",
    "figure [ bandh ] summarizes the results .",
    "the lda band gap is still direct but significantly lowered , from 0.81 ev in the frm2 to 0.67 ev in the frm2/h / vacuum structure .",
    "interface reconstruction ( as discussed in section [ ionic ] and fig .",
    "[ couches ] ) thus has significant impact on the electronic properties .",
    "the bands in the plane orthogonal to the growth axis are quite different from frm2 ; e.g. , the valence band is lowered near the @xmath61 and @xmath58 points , becoming similar to the c - si bandstructure .",
    "we thus conclude that the subo si atoms have two effects : ( i ) increase the bandgap and ( ii ) produce dispersionless valence bands .",
    "the charge states in the subo are responsible for the increase in the bandgap , while the strongly increased valence - band offset leads to essentially dispersionless bands .",
    "the matrix elements entering the calculations of the optical properties are often approximated as a constant in a given range of energies .",
    "however , such an approximation is inadequate for elucidating the enhanced luminescence in si / sio@xmath0 sls .",
    "this section deals with calculating the absorption coefficient within the fermi golden rule and interband - transition theory .",
    "since the si - layer thickness @xmath1 is relevant to the energy - shift in sls , this quantity needs first to be defined .",
    "this involves some uncertainty associated with the interface thicknesses @xmath62 .",
    "the interface thickness @xmath62 was estimated to be @xmath471.60 from our calculations of the subo si region .",
    "this is the largest distance ( projected onto the @xmath56 axis ) between any two subo si atoms . hence the upper - bound to @xmath1 are , 11.17  , 16.58   and 22.01   for the frm1 , frm2 and frm3 respectively , while the lower - bound thicknesses are simply @xmath63 .",
    "we define the si thickness in the sls to include the interface subo si atoms as well ( corresponding to the upper bound ) .",
    "this choice is made since subo si ( si@xmath35 , si@xmath36 or si@xmath34 ) atoms contribute to the electronic properties , as do bulk - si atoms ( si@xmath48 atoms ) ; for instance , we showed above [ see e.g. fig .",
    "[ bandsioh](b ) ] that the bandstructures of the frm2 sls and the frm2/o - h / vacuum systems overlap , and indicated where the effective barrier begins .",
    "the band gaps of the frm1 , frm2 and frm3 ( see the bandstructures in fig .  [ bands ] ) are direct except for the frm1 where the band gap is _ nearly _ direct with only 0.12 ev between the direct and indirect transitions .",
    "the values of the gap are , and for the frm1 , frm2 and frm3 , respectively . the direct transition at @xmath60 for the frm1 equals .",
    "for the frm2 and the frm3 , the band gaps are direct and located on the whole @xmath59@xmath60 axis [ see fig .  [",
    "bands](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "direct transitions can thus be achieved between the valence band and the conduction band , along the @xmath64 line of the bz .",
    "we thus obtain , under the lda , a blue shift @xmath65 with increased confinement @xmath66 however , these values for the energy gaps are much lower than the experimental ones .",
    "it is well known that dft within the lda underestimates the energy gaps of semiconductors and insulators . for c",
    "- si , the dft - lda gap is approximately 0.6 ev less than the experimental value . for the @xmath3-cristobalite phase of sio@xmath0 , in the group @xmath67 , the dft - lda energy gap is while the experimental value is about 3 ev higher , i.e. , .",
    "approximate , but realistic , band gaps can be obtained by adding 0.6 ev overall : @xmath68 these energy gaps correspond to the lower bound of the experiments@xcite and lie in the visible spectrum .",
    "however , these gaps are still somewhat lower than the experimental values.@xcite the discrepancy can be explained by recrystallization processes , which lead to the formation of nanoclusters that would increase the confinement , and correspondingly the measured energy gaps.@xcite the analysis of such a behaviour , which is beyond the scope of the present work , would require zero - dimensional - confined model structures .",
    "the absorption of the three sl models and c - si have been calculated both in the diamond - like bz and in the sls bz . for c",
    "- si in the diamond - like bz , we used * k * points,@xcite while in the sls bz , * k * points are used .",
    "calculations using more * k * points , viz .",
    ", show that is quite sufficient to recover the form of the absorption curve for all the sl models .",
    "the purpose of calculating the absorption of c - si in two different bz is to estimate errors , first due to zone folding effects ( which cause round - off errors , leading to non - absolutely - null transitions at the onset)@xcite and , second , to the tetrahedron method itself which needs large amounts of * k * points .",
    "the broadening in the absorption curves has been fixed to for all the absorption curves discussed below , as suggested by fuggle.@xcite    figure [ absorp ] shows the absorption results .",
    "panels ( a ) and ( b ) give an overall view of the absorption curves for the @xmath56 axis in ( a ) and the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane in ( b ) .",
    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the absorption at the onset , for the @xmath56 axis in ( c ) and the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane in ( d ) . in all cases",
    ", we included the absorption of c - si calculated in the diamond - like bz , as well as the one in the sls bz .",
    "direct comparison of the two c - si absorption curves give an estimate of imprecisions due to zone foldings and intermediate number of * k * point effects .",
    "it shows that the absorption is slightly underestimated in the sl calculations ; e.g. , in fig .",
    "[ absorp](c ) , the onset of absorption of c - si in the sls bz take place at 2.0 ev while in the diamond - like bz the onset happens at the correct value of 2.52 ev ( which is for c - si the lda direct transition at @xmath60 ) .",
    "this numerical effect can not be avoided and will arise , as well , in any si / sio@xmath0 supercell . hence , all comparison of the sls absorption must be made with c - si calculated in the equivalent sls bz , i.e. , within equivalent * k * space zone schemes .",
    "since the sls are fabricated with the objective of changing the indirect gap to a direct gap , we now discuss the absorption threshold region .",
    "comparison at the onset of absorption from fig .",
    "[ absorp](c ) or ( d ) shows that all absorption curves have a lower energy threshold than _ both _ the c - si absorption curves , and especially below the one calculated in equivalent sls bz having equal number of * k * points . that is , _ the sls show absorption ( and emission ) in the spectral region above the indirect gap of c - si and below the direct gap of c - si_. this shows that the absorption in _ all _ confined si / sio@xmath0 sl models is enhanced , compared to ; the transitions are direct in sls and have an active oscillator strength . for the folded c - si energy bands ,",
    "the lower bands above the fermi level , and the corresponding oscillator strength , remain dark ; in other words , the optical matrix elements of the sl bz of c - si are null up to @xmath472.0 ev .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates the enhancement of the absorption ( and emission ) mechanisms in confined si structures .",
    "furthermore , upon inspection of the absorption curves in the plane orthogonal to the growth axis [ fig .",
    "[ absorp](d ) ] , we note that the energy thresholds of the absorption are all below c - si : thus , the @xmath52-@xmath53 absorption of the frms takes place approximately at their respective direct energy gaps , and then behave in a similar manner , as expected from the similarity of the sls bandstructures , in this plane .",
    "we examine , finally , the higher - energy region which corresponds to the usual direct transition ( 3 - 6 ev ) in c - si .",
    "even here , fig .",
    "[ absorp](a ) demonstrates a blueshift with increased confinement in the @xmath56 axis .",
    "the overall absorption maxima for frm1-frm3 are at 5.28 ev , 4.83 ev , and 4.71 ev , with intensities of 136 , 155 and 162 ( @xmath69/cm ) respectively . for c",
    "- si in the sls bz ( to ensure comparable precision in the calculations ) the second peak , i.e. , the maximum , take place at 4.70 ev ( with absorption equal to ) , while the first peak is at 4.0 ev ( and with absorption equal to ) .",
    "we emphazise that there is still a slight blueshift in the @xmath52-@xmath53 plane orthogonal to the growth axis , but less pronounced than in the growth axis .",
    "in this work , the structural , electronic and optical properties of si / sio@xmath0 superlattices have been studied on the basis of structurally - relaxed models .",
    "these sl models , which contain no hydrogen atoms at the si / sio@xmath0 interfaces , exhibit enhanced optical absorption / emission , as observed in experiment ; this can be attributed to the presence of silicon dioxide barriers . in experiments performed under ultra - high vacuum conditions",
    ", the oxidization process would predominantly give rise to oxide bonds at the interfaces , but still , few hydrogen atoms are expected to be present and fill some of the remaining dangling bonds .",
    "our calculations show that the oxide barriers are central to the optical enhancement in sls .",
    "it is well known that hydrogen atoms play a similar role in amorphous silicon by filling dangling bonds .",
    "this suggests that it might also be the case in si / sio@xmath0 sls , where hydrogen atoms fill extra dangling bonds , and thus would amplify the optical enhancement effect already exerted by the oxide barriers .",
    "further studies are needed to ascertain this .",
    "we have shown that suboxide si atoms at the interfaces act as virtually impenetrable barriers .",
    "the active barrier thickness thus corresponds to the suboxide si layer  only 1.6   in our models .",
    "the confined si layer thus consists of bulk si _ and _ suboxide si atoms .",
    "suboxide si atoms at the interfaces modify the electronic properties in two manners : they ( i ) increase the energy gap and ( ii ) lead to dispersionless band structures , which increases the transition probabilities .    other confinement models ( zero - dimensional structures ) and interface effects will be considered in future work .",
    "for instance , inclusion of other atomic species  such as nitrogen that would generate subnitric si atoms at the si / sio@xmath0 interface  are expected to modify the electronic properties , and hence enhance the optical absorption / emission spectra .",
