    "charmless semileptonic @xmath1 meson decays are mediated by a @xmath3 quark transition .",
    "the study of inclusive and exclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decays provide two independent paths for a determination of the strength of the flavour - changing interaction . in the standard model",
    "the quark transition is governed by the ckm matrix element @xmath4 , which constitutes an important input parameter for many analyses in flavour physics .",
    "since the determination of ckm matrix elements from exclusive semileptonic @xmath1 meson decays requires the knowledge of non - perturbative form factors , the determination from inclusive semileptonic decays is a priori cleaner from the theoretical point of view .",
    "the total decay rate can be described by a local operator product expansion ( ope ) in a simultaneous expansion in @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the local ope can be applied for inclusive @xmath7 decays , where the non - perturbative information is constrained to some numbers , hqet parameters , which can be extracted simultaneously with @xmath8 from an analysis of the @xmath1 meson decay spectra .",
    "a major complication arises in charmless semileptonic @xmath1 decays where experimental measurements of the @xmath0 decay rate have to introduce kinematical cuts to suppress the @xmath7 background .",
    "this restricts the experimentally accessible information to the shape - function region in which the hadronic final state has large energy @xmath9 but moderate invariant mass @xmath10 .",
    "the theoretical description of partial decay rates in the shape - function region is more complicated and gives rise to a multi - scale ope in terms of non - local light - cone operators .    the development of qcd factorization@xcite and soft - collinear effective theory(scet ) @xcite",
    "has widely improved our understanding of strong interaction effects in charmless @xmath1 meson decays . a factorization theorem for the partial @xmath0 decay rate in the shape - function region",
    "has originally been proposed in the diagrammatic approach  @xcite and has later been formulated in the operator formalism within scet . the factorization formula can be expressed in terms of the hadronic tensor @xmath11 , which encodes the strong interaction effects in @xmath0 decays , schematically as @xmath12 with hard coefficient functions @xmath13 , a jet function @xmath14 and a shape function @xmath15 which describes the distribution of the residual light - cone momentum of the @xmath16-quark within the @xmath1 meson  @xcite ( the @xmath17 are some tensor coefficients ) . whereas the hard functions and the jet function can be computed in perturbation theory , since they describe fluctuations with virtualities @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively , the shape function represents a non - perturbative input to the factorization formula .    in this work",
    "we address perturbative corrections to the factorization formula ( [ eq : ff : short ] ) .",
    "next - to - leading order ( nlo ) corrections to the hard functions @xmath20 and the jet function @xmath14 have been computed in  @xcite and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) corrections to the jet function have been worked out in  @xcite .",
    "the only missing piece for a nnlo analysis of inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 decays in the shape - function region consists in the @xmath21 corrections to the hard functions which we consider in this work .",
    "a first step towards the computation of nnlo corrections to the hard functions has been taken recently in  @xcite .",
    "the authors of  @xcite computed 2-loop qcd corrections to the form factors which parameterize the @xmath3 quark transition .",
    "we present an independent calculation of these 2-loop form factors and extend the analysis of  @xcite in two respects : first , we perform the subsequent matching calculation within scet to extract the hard functions @xmath20 from the form factors which are formally infrared divergent .",
    "second , we keep a non - vanishing charm quark mass in our 2-loop calculation which has been set to zero in  @xcite .",
    "the 2-loop calculation that we present in this work is closely related to the calculation of nnlo vertex corrections in hadronic @xmath1 decays which we considered in  @xcite .",
    "it is in fact somewhat simpler than the one in  @xcite since it involves only a small subset of feynman diagrams and 2-loop integrals .",
    "a further complication arises in the analysis of  @xcite through the appearance of evanescent four - quark operators which makes the matching calculation rather involved .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : to set up our notation , we briefly recapitulate the necessary ingredients for the matching calculation in section  [ sec : setup ] . the 2-loop calculation of the qcd form factors is described in section  [ sec : qcd ] .",
    "we perform the matching calculation in section  [ sec : matching ] , where we present our results for the nnlo hard coefficient functions @xmath20 .",
    "we extend our analysis to include charm mass effects in section  [ sec : charm ] .",
    "we briefly analyze the numerical impact of the nnlo corrections in section  [ sec : numerics ] , before we conclude in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we collect some results for the nlo and nnlo coefficient functions and for the charm mass dependent master integrals in appendices  [ app:1loop]-[app : mis ] .",
    "the basic quantity for the analysis of strong interaction effects to inclusive semileptonic @xmath1 meson decays is the hadronic tensor @xmath11 , which is defined via the discontinuity of the forward matrix element of the correlation function of two weak interaction currents @xmath22 , @xmath23 | b(p_b ) \\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the present analysis of inclusive semileptonic decays in the shape - function region it will be convenient to introduce light - cone coordinates .",
    "we introduce two light - like vectors @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "any four - vector can be decomposed according to its projections onto these light - cone directions and a two - dimensional transverse plane as @xmath27 in the shape - function region the momentum of the hadronic final state @xmath28 scales as a hard - collinear momentum , i.e.  @xmath29 with @xmath30 . a factorization theorem for the hadronic tensor @xmath11",
    "can be established in a two - step matching procedure qcd  @xmath31  scet  @xmath31  hqet . in the first step",
    "hard fluctuations with virtuality @xmath18 are integrated out .",
    "the semileptonic current becomes to leading power in @xmath32 @xmath33(x+sn_+)\\gamma_i^\\mu h_v(x_- ) , \\label{eq : matching}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the @xmath1 meson velocity @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "the static @xmath16-quark field @xmath36 is defined in hqet and the hard - collinear @xmath37-quark field @xmath38 and the wilson line @xmath39 in scet .",
    "the momentum space wilson coefficients can be obtained via @xmath40 in the second matching step hard - collinear fluctuations with virtuality @xmath19 are integrated out .",
    "this gives rise to another perturbative coefficient function , the jet function @xmath14 , and a remnant hqet matrix element , the shape function @xmath15 .",
    "the factorization formula for the hadronic tensor becomes to leading power in @xmath32 @xmath41 the hard functions @xmath20 , which we consider in this work , are related to the wilson coefficients @xmath42 of the semileptonic current by @xmath43 .",
    "we may therefore mainly focus on the matching relation ( [ eq : matching ] ) instead of the factorization formula for the hadronic tensor ( [ eq : ff : exact ] ) .",
    "the matching calculation simplifies if we work with on - shell quarks and regularize ultraviolet ( uv ) and infrared ( ir ) singularities in dimensional regularization ( dr ) ( we write @xmath44 and use an anticommuting @xmath45 according to the ndr scheme ) . in this case",
    "the scet diagrams are scaleless and vanish and the main task consists in the computation of the 2-loop qcd corrections to the left - hand side of ( [ eq : matching ] ) .",
    "we parameterize the qcd result in terms of three form factors , @xmath46 b(p_b),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with momentum transfer @xmath47 . on the other hand we work in a frame with @xmath48 and",
    "choose the basis of three independent dirac structures in ( [ eq : matching ] ) as @xmath49 writing the momentum of the on - shell @xmath16-quark as @xmath50 and the one of the @xmath37-quark as @xmath51 provides the link between the form factors @xmath52 and the coefficient functions @xmath42 .",
    "we finally introduce a dimensionless variable @xmath37 to parameterize the light - cone momentum of the @xmath37-quark as @xmath53 . in this notation",
    "the momentum transfer becomes @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "to nnlo the qcd calculation of the form factors @xmath56 involves the calculation of the 2-loop diagrams from figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , the calculation can be inferred from the calculation of the 2-loop vertex corrections to hadronic @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "the present calculation involves only a small subset of 2-loop diagrams and about half of the master integrals ( mis ) that have been computed in  @xcite .",
    "the calculation follows the same strategy that has been used in  @xcite .",
    "we first express tensor integrals in terms of scalar integrals with the help of a general tensor decomposition .",
    "we then use an automatized reduction algorithm , which is based on integration - by - parts techniques  @xcite and the laporta algorithm  @xcite , to express the scalar integrals in terms of an irreducible set of master integrals ( mis ) .",
    "as long as we neglect the charm quark mass , the present calculation gives rise to 14 mis which are depicted in figure  [ fig : mis ] .",
    "all mis have already been calculated in  @xcite with the help of the method of differential equations  @xcite , the formalism of harmonic polylogarithms ( hpls )  @xcite , mellin - barnes techniques  @xcite and the method of sector decomposition  @xcite .",
    "the mis from figure  [ fig : mis ] can be expressed in terms of hpls of weight @xmath57 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we give our results in terms of the following minimal set of hpls @xmath58 moreover , we introduce a shorthand notation for a hpl of weight @xmath59 , whose expression in terms of nielsen polylogarithms is rather involved @xmath60 and for a hpl of weight @xmath61 , which can not be expressed in terms of nielsen poly - logarithms and has to be evaluated numerically , @xmath62 the mis from figure  [ fig : mis ] have been computed in an analytic form  @xcite , apart from a single number @xmath63 which arises in the calculation of the boundary condition to the 6-topology mi ( last diagram from figure  [ fig : mis ] ) . with the help of the mathematica package fiesta  @xcite , we can compute this number to higher precision than in  @xcite .",
    "we now find @xmath64 .",
    "the form factors , which we obtain from the 2-loop diagrams of figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , are uv- and ir - divergent .",
    "the uv - divergences are subtracted in the renormalization procedure which amounts to the calculation of several 1-loop diagrams with standard qcd counterterm insertions .",
    "we account for the wave - function renormalization of the quark fields by @xmath65 where @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) is the wave - function renormalization factor of the massless @xmath37-quark ( massive @xmath16-quark ) . writing the perturbative expansion in terms of the renormalized coupling constant @xmath68 , @xmath69 we find that the renormalized form factors are given to nnlo by @xmath70 we renormalize the coupling constant in the -scheme ( adopting the notation ( [ eq : pertexp ] ) ) @xmath71 whereas the quark wave - functions and the @xmath16-quark mass are renormalized in the on - shell scheme , @xmath72 and @xmath73 because of the fact that scaleless integrals vanish in dr .",
