    "the stellar tidal streams and substructure of the milky way ( mw ) provides an important observational window into the assembly of the galaxy in a universe dominated by dark energy and dark matter . in the standard @xmath7cdm model ,",
    "numerical simulations show that massive galaxies like the milky way grow hierarchically , that is , from the continuous accretion and tidal destruction of smaller systems such as dwarf galaxies and globular clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "observations of the galaxy s halo support this picture : in addition to the @xmath8 known dwarf galaxy satellites of the milky way ( @xcite ) , a total of 21 stellar streams have been discovered to - date in wide - field optical imaging surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; e.g. , @xcite ) , pandas @xcite , pan - starrs @xcite , atlas @xcite , and des @xcite .    despite the growing number of stream discoveries , only four stellar streams have known progenitors : the globular clusters pal  5 , ngc  5466 , ngc  288 and the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal .",
    "developing a detailed picture of the origin of the galaxy s halo requires understanding the relative contribution of tidally - destroyed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies .",
    "searching for and quantifying the ages , metallicities , and kinematics of likely stream progenitors is therefore an important step towards a more complete picture of the hierarchical assembly of the mw s halo in a cosmological context .    the eastern banded structure ( ebs )",
    "stream ( figure  [ fig : spatial - ebs ] ) is an ideal target for such a study , as it is relatively nearby ( @xmath9 kpc ; grillmair 2011 ) and therefore may be close enough for proper motion measurements .",
    "@xcite discovered the ebs in sdss imaging data as a relatively broad stellar stream near the monoceros ring stellar overdensity .",
    "@xcite identified an extended double - lobed , @xmath10 sq . degree feature along the stream  called hydra  i  which has a suface density larger than any other overdensity along the stream ( white boxed region in figure  [ fig : spatial - ebs ] ) .",
    "based on its morphology and prominence , @xcite suggested that hydra  i may be the progenitor of the ebs stream . using sdss / segue spectroscopic observations that are spatially coincident with hydra i , @xcite demonstrated the presence of a kinematically cold population of stars , with @xmath11 km s@xmath12 and the colors and magnitudes expected for an old , metal - poor population at the distance of the ebs .",
    "the origin and nature of the ebs / hydra  i features are complicated by their proximity to ( and possible association with ) a number of galactic anti - center structures , including the monoceros ring @xcite , the anti - center stream @xcite , and the triangulum andromeda substructures ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the origin and relationship between these features remains intensely debated ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for example , it is currently unclear whether the monoceros ring is tidal debris from an accreted dwarf galaxy @xcite or has its origin in the galactic disk  as either a normal warp / flare @xcite or as the result of kicked - up stars from disk oscillations occurring from an encounter with a massive satellite @xcite .",
    "we consider our results in the context of these galactic anti - center structures in our discussion ( section  [ subsec : other ] ) .",
    "hydra  i presents a unique opportunity to study a milky way satellite undergoing active disruption . in this work",
    "we determine hydra  i s stellar population , chemical , and kinematic properties with the aim of exploring whether the object is a disrupting dwarf galaxy or star cluster .",
    "previous studies of hydra  i region were limited by a small number candidate member stars ( with large velocity uncertainties ) , prohibiting detailed tests of hydra  i s nature . in this work , we combine higher precision photometric and spectroscopic data of hydra  i  from the dark energy camera ( decam ; @xcite ) and mmt / hectochelle spectrograph @xcite  with with archival sdss data to study hydra  i using a large sample of candidate stars .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "data ] we describe our observational data sets . in section  [ sec : sample ] we discuss the selection of candidate member stars , and in section  [ sec : results ] we present the results of our analysis and the derived properties of hydra  i. we discuss possible scenarios concerning the nature of hydra  i in section  [ sec : discussion ] , and present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "observations of hydra  i were obtained on 20 - 23 march 2014 using the decam imager installed on the ctio blanco 4 m telescope .",
    "the decam imager consists of sixty - two @xmath13 imaging ccds ( chip gaps of @xmath14 ) arranged in a circular layout in the focal plane . on the blanco telescope ,",
    "this layout provides imaging over a @xmath15 degree diameter , resulting in a @xmath16 square degree imaging area with @xmath17 pixels .",
    "we imaged hydra  i using the @xmath18 filters , but to facilitate comparisons with other studies of hydra  i / ebs and the galactic anti - center region , we only present the @xmath19 imaging in this work .",
    "we used a series of @xmath20 sec exposures in each of the @xmath21 and @xmath22 filters and dithered between exposures to fill in the chip gaps .",
    "figure  [ fig : spatial - ebs ] shows the resulting footprint of the decam imaging ( @xmath23 deg@xmath24 ) on the hydra  i field .",
    "all imaging was obtained under photometric or near - photometric conditions .",
    "the mean fwhm of the image point - spread functions ( psfs ) for the exposures ranged from @xmath25 to @xmath26 .",
    "the data were reduced using the noao community pipeline ( cp ; @xcite ) and downloaded from the noao science archive .",
    "the cp performs both a standard instrumental calibration of the raw images ( bias , overscan , cross - talk corrections ; fringing corrections ; dome flat and sky flat field corrections ) and corrects for geometric distortions by reprojecting the images onto a common spatial scale .",
    "we performed photometry on each decam exposure by separately analyzing each of the 62 reduced , reprojected chips using the daophotii / allstar software suite @xcite .",
    "we derive a catalog of point sources using cuts on the daophot chi and sharp parameters which vary as a function of magnitude depth . to ensure a robust characterization of sources",
    ", we require that object must be point - like in each of the @xmath27 images .",
    "the hydra  i / ebs region is located in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) footprint , and so we derive calibrated magnitudes by matching directly to sdss data release 8 ( sdss dr8 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we derived a photometric solution for each individual decam exposure separately , after correcting the instrumental magnitudes for atmospheric extinction .",
    "we derived zero points and linear color terms using the maximum likelihood approach described by @xcite , using only point sources which have high s / n in both the decam and sdss imaging and sdss colors of @xmath28 .",
    "we impose the latter constraint in order to improve the photometric calibration over the color region of interest for this study .",
    "lastly , all calibrated apparent magnitudes presented in this study were corrected for galactic extinction using the reddening maps of @xcite and the reddening coefficients of @xcite .",
    "the mean color excess in the hydra  i region imaged by decam is e(b - v ) @xmath29 mag and varies by @xmath30 mag across the field of view .    the final hydra  i decam point source catalog was constructed by calculating the weighted mean magnitude of each point source from the individual measurements on each frame .",
    "we used the uncertainties in the calibrated magnitudes ( in flux space ) as the weights and used an iterative sigma - clipping algorithm to reject any measurements which fell @xmath31 from the mean .",
    "the uncertainties in the weighted mean magnitudes were calculated from the inverse square of the flux errors .",
    "the final catalog contains @xmath32 sources between @xmath33 mag over a @xmath23 deg@xmath34 area .",
    "we present the entire photometric data set in table  [ tbl : decam ] , which is available in machine readable format from the publisher .",
    "the number of point sources as a function of magnitude depth drops dramatically at @xmath35 , @xmath36 mag .",
    "we therefore estimate that our imaging is complete at @xmath37 mag brighter than these limits .",
    "a completeness limit at @xmath38 is sufficient for the purposes of this study . as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : sample ] , the main - sequence turn off ( msto ) in the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of hydra  i is at @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) mag , significantly brighter than our estimated incompleteness depths .",
    "we used mmt / hectochelle to target stars throughout the hydra  i overdensity . following the previous analysis by @xcite , we targeted stars from sdss within 0.1 mag of a 13 gyr , [ fe / h ] = -1.8 isochrone @xcite at a distance of 9.7 kpc ( however , see our conclusions in   [ sec : stellar - pops ] regarding the age and metallicity of hydra  i ) . figure  [ fig : targeting ] shows the selection filter on the sdss color - magnitude - number density ( hess ) diagram of stars within the @xmath23 deg@xmath24 footprint of the decam imaging .",
    "we chose a cmd filter with a relatively blue edge in order to explore the possibility of younger ( bluer ) stellar populations in hydra  i. because the expected red giant branch ( rgb ) population of hydra  i overlaps with mw thick disk stars in color and magnitude ( see figure  [ fig : targeting ] ) , objects fainter than @xmath41 mag were given priority for our hectochelle observations in order to minimize contamination .",
    "spectroscopic observations were obtained over 7 nights using the hectochelle spectrograph on the 6.5 m mmt .",
    "hectochelle uses 240 fibers across a @xmath42 degree diameter field of view to take single order spectra at a resolution of @xmath43 .",
    "we used the rv31 order selecting filter to isolate the 150    around the mg b triplet ( 5167 - 5184   ) .",
    "the field of view of hectochelle is well suited to observing hydra  i. we obtained seven pointings around hydra  i , primarily in relatively bright or grey observing time , with total exposure times ranging from 4800 to 19,8000 sec per pointing .",
    "we targeted the areas on the primary overdensities and along the stream slightly southeast of the two main lobes .",
    "the footprint of the hectochelle observations are shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : spatial - ebs ] .",
    "we obtained spectra for a total of 796 stars with magnitudes in the range @xmath44 .",
    "the multifiber spectra were reduced in a uniform manner . for each field",
    ", the separate exposures were debiased and flat fielded , and then compared before extraction to allow identification and elimination of cosmic rays through interpolation .",
    "spectra were then extracted , combined and wavelength calibrated using contemporaneous exposures of a thar lamp ( the spectra were not - linearized in dispersion ) .",
    "each fiber has a distinct wavelength dependence in throughput , which can be estimated using exposures of a continuum source or the twilight sky .",
    "a background sky estimate was made by combining data from fibers placed randomly in the focal plane , but excluding those which accidentally fell on a source .",
    "this sky spectrum was finely interpolated onto the object spectrum s wavelength grid and then subtracted .",
    "we model the hectochelle spectra using the procedure introduced by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter w15 ) to model sky - subtracted hectochelle spectra .",

    "following w15 , we choose @xmath54 , providing sufficient flexibility to fit the observed continuum shape and to apply low - order corrections to the wavelength solution .",
    "we adopt scale parameters @xmath55    and @xmath56  , such that @xmath57 over the entire range ( 5160   - 5280   ) considered in the fits .    again following w15 , we generate template spectra @xmath58 using the synthetic library that was used for sspp parameter estimation @xcite .",
    "the sspp library contains rest - frame , continuum - normalized , stellar spectra computed over a grid of atmospheric parameters spanning @xmath59 in effective temperature ( with spacing @xmath60 ) , @xmath61\\leq 5 $ ] in surface gravity ( @xmath62=0.25 $ ] dex ) and @xmath63}\\leq + 1 $ ] in metallicity ( @xmath64}=0.25 $ ] dex ) .",

    "the synthetic library spectra are calculated over the range @xmath68   at resolution @xmath69   /pixel , which we degrade to @xmath70   per pixel  twice as fine as our hectochelle spectra .",
    "our spectral model , @xmath71 , is specified fully by a vector of 13 free parameters . in order to fit the model and obtain estimates for each parameter , we follow w15 s bayesian approach and adopt the same priors specified in their table 2 .",
    "we use the software package multinest @xcite to sample the posterior probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) .",
    "as described in w15 , the sampling of the pdfs allows one to evaluate the `` gaussianity '' of the posterior pdfs by calculating the first four moments ( mean , variance , skew , kurtosis ) of the 1d marginalized pdfs of each parameter .",
    "w15 note that in the high s / n regime , the posterior pdfs become increasingly gaussian and therefore allow one to define a measure of quality control .",
    "that is , the gaussianity measure provides confidence that the calculated variance on the velocity is a good measure of the 1@xmath72 standard deviation ( @xmath73 confidence interval ) . in practice , we keep only those spectra for which the model fits yield gaussian shaped posterior pdfs as defined in w15 ( see their section 4.1 and figure  4 ) .    while our fits to the hectochelle spectra return simultaneous estimates of stellar - atmospheric parameters @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and [ fe / h ] , we find that these quantities exhibit systematic as well as random errors that are larger than those found , using the same technique on spectra from the same instrument , by w15 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that our current spectra were acquired in relatively bright conditions and our sky - subtracted spectra suffer significantly more residual contamination by scattered sunlight .",
    "therefore , in this work we shall use only the velocities obtained from our hectochelle spectra ; for stellar - atmospheric parameters we will rely on the sdss / segue catalog .",
    "we examined the data quality and measurement reliability using both repeat observations and the pipeline data quality measures described above . to ensure a reliable dataset , we adopted cuts on the radial velocity error ( v@xmath76 2.1 km s@xmath12 , or 3 times the median velocity error of @xmath77 km s@xmath12 ) and removed spectra with large residual contamination from scattered sunlight . after applying these cuts , 411 stars remained in the hectochelle sample .",
    "these data are presented in table  [ tbl : hecto ] and include the decam magnitudes ( corrected for galactic extinction ) .",
    "the spatial positions of stars fainter than @xmath78 are shown with respect to the smoothed spatial map of hydra i in figure  [ fig : spatial - hydra ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the radial velocity error of the hectochelle data as a function of magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : velocity - error ] .",
    "we obtain velocity errors less than @xmath79  km s@xmath12 to a limiting magnitude of @xmath80 , approximately two magnitudes below the main sequence turnoff ( msto ) of hydra  i.      we complemented our hectochelle data with archival spectroscopy from sdss , adopting the spectroscopic parameters derived from the segue stellar parameter pipeline ( sspp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unlike the mmt / hectochelle target selection , the original sdss survey spectroscopic selections were designed to meet a number of scientific goals .",
    "we analyze the same segue pointing as schlaufman et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ; b-8/pci-9/pcii-21 ) , but because the sdss data are more heterogeneously selected , we applied the same isochrone cut in color and magnitude used to select the hectochelle targets ",
    "i.e. , selecting only stars that might reasonably be hydra  i members .",
    "these data are presented in table  [ tbl : sdss ] and include the decam magnitudes ( corrected for galactic extinction ) .",
    "although segue spectroscopic stars are a biased sampling of stars within this color - magnitude selection , they should still yield a unbiased measurement of its kinematic properties and a lower limit on its spread in [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "the right panel of figure  [ fig : spatial - hydra ] shows the spatial distribution of the sdss / segue stars fainter than @xmath81 .",
    "the decam photometry reveals a prominent msto feature in the hess diagram ( figure  [ fig : targeting ] ) at @xmath82 , @xmath83 mag which is not apparent in the sdss cmd . because the decam imaging covers a relatively large area ( compared to the spatial extent of hydra  i )",
    ", we consider only a small region of @xmath84 deg@xmath24 ( radius of @xmath85 deg ) centered on hydra  i in this study .",
    "this central region is shown on the smoothed spatial map of hydra  i in figure  [ fig : spatial - hydra ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : decam - with - background ] shows the decam cmds of the central @xmath84 sq .",
    "deg region and an equal - area region adjacent to hydra  i for comparison .",
    "the comparison region was selected from the non - hydra  i decam imaging area located to the west of hydra  i. only hints of the hydra  i msto and ms features which are present in the central pointing can be seen in the adjacent pointing , demonstrating that hydra  i is spatially concentrated . however , because the adjacent comparison region is located relatively close to hydra  i , this region may not be truly sampling the background .",
    "we can therefore not rule out the possibility that the msto stars in the comparison region are simply ebs / hydra  i member stars located slightly outside the primary spatial overdensities .",
    "the hectochelle targeting employed a relatively wide , sdss - based cmd filter , and given that we have clearly detected the msto of hydra  i , we can remove likely contaminants using their location on the higher precision decam cmd .",
    "stars with hectochelle / mmt observations are shown in figure  [ fig : decam - cmds ] and are colored by their measured radial velocities .",
    "the sdss / segue sample is shown on the same cmd in figure  [ fig : sdss - cmds ] , where stars are colored by their velocities ( [ fig : sdss - cmds]a ) , iron abundances ( [ fig : sdss - cmds]b ) , and alpha abundances ( [ fig : sdss - cmds]c ) , respectively .",
    "the radial velocities of stars along the ms are quite similar ( @xmath86 km s@xmath12 ; see figs  [ fig : decam - cmds]a and  [ fig : sdss - cmds]a ) , whereas thick disk stars at brighter magnitudes show a larger velocity spread and have higher iron abundances ( @xmath87 } < 0 $ ] ) . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath88 ) , the sdss sample shows that both the iron abundance and velocity of msto stars are well correlated . in contrast , stars at slightly redder colors ( @xmath89 ) show a wider spread in velocity and may be on average more metal - poor than msto stars .    we define a `` faint sample '' of hectochelle stars using a narrower cmd filter shown by the blue dashed lines in figure  [ fig : decam - cmds]b .",
    "this filter has a red edge which is 0.06 mag bluer than our sdss selection filter , minimizing contamination from redder stars ( @xmath89 ) .",
    "the filter also removes thick disk stars at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath90 ) , slightly brighter than the msto . for our faint sample ,",
    "we only include stars within the central @xmath84 sq . degrees centered on hydra  i , resulting in a total of 122 stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : decam - cmds]d shows the velocity histogram of the hectochelle faint sample . for comparison we show stars at brighter magnitudes ( @xmath90 ) which would have passed the narrow cmd filter .",
    "the contamination is readily apparent in the velocity histogram of bright stars , which only shows a small excess of stars at the measured systemic velocity of hydra  i ( @xmath91 km s@xmath12 ) .",
    "by contrast , the faint sample shows that hydra  i is a significant overdensity of stars in velocity space , consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "the sdss faint sample is selected without the use of a narrower , bluer cmd filter due to the larger color measurement uncertainties .",
    "although this may slightly increase contamination , we use the sspp [ fe / h ] measurements as an additional parameter in our membership probability calculations ( see section  [ sec : memberships ] ) .",
