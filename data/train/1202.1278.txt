    "calabi - yau compactifications of string theory , despite their welcome features , suffer from the infamous moduli problem , the existence of flat directions in the four - dimensional potential corresponding to scalar fields which are not stabilized .",
    "the most plausible scenario which resulted from the attempts to resolve this problem was the introduction of fluxes , namely vacuum expectation values of the tensor fields of the theory along the compactification manifold .",
    "these fluxes typically lead to a deformation of the internal manifold away from the calabi - yau property and suggest the study of non - khler manifolds @xcite .",
    "unlike type ii string theories , where the plentitude of ramond - ramond fields offers considerable freedom in the introduction of internal fluxes , the heterotic string case is more restrictive .",
    "indeed , in the heterotic string the only field which may acquire an expectation value is the three - form @xmath1 of the common ns sector of string theory .",
    "moreover , this field satisfies a more restrictive bianchi identity than in the type ii case .",
    "however , apart from the above field , it was suggested that , due to some strong dynamics in the hidden sector , fermion bilinears may also acquire some vacuum expectation value , thus forming a condensate @xcite . from a calabi - yau perspective",
    "such condensates are related to supersymmetry breakdown .",
    "supersymmetric ads@xmath0 heterotic compactifications on non - khler manifolds with fluxes and gaugino condensation were studied in @xcite . moreover ,",
    "a study including dilatino condensation was performed in @xcite . however , the above studies do not deal with the solution of the equations of motion of the theory but only with the killing spinor equations and the bianchi identity . nevertheless , according to ivanov @xcite , it is not straightforward that the solution of the latter imply that the field equations are satisfied",
    ". therefore it is more natural to directly investigate solutions of the field equations of the theory , whether supersymmetric or not .",
    "such a perspective was employed in @xcite where two such solutions were described , a supersymmetric one with fluxes and gaugino condensation and a non - supersymmetric one without gaugino condensation .    in the present paper",
    "we extend the analysis of @xcite by implementing dilatino condensates into the theory .",
    "working at first order in @xmath2 , we consider the heterotic string including four - fermion terms in the action and the supersymmetry variations . varying this action ,",
    "the corresponding equations of motion are determined .",
    "assuming as background a product of four - dimensional ads@xmath0 spacetime with a nearly khler internal space , all solutions to these equations are derived for two different choices of the connection on the tangent bundle .",
    "the bianchi identity is also taken into account in order to guarantee the absence of all anomalies .",
    "an important feature of our investigation , motivated by the results of @xcite , is that the gauge field is taken to be a generalized instanton .",
    "although it is in principle possible to consider non - instanton solutions , gauge fields enjoying the instanton property are distinguished by their immediate assurance for the fulfillment of the yang - mills equations .",
    "apart from the solutions which were obtained in @xcite , our analysis reveals five sets of new non - supersymmetric solutions .",
    "thus a classification of all possible nearly khler heterotic compactifications with torsion and fermion condensates is provided .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we present the action and the killing spinor equations of the field theory limit of the heterotic string at first order in @xmath2 , retaining four - fermion terms involving the gaugino and the dilatino .",
    "subsequently we determine the field equations resulting from this action and their decomposition according to the spacetime factorization ads@xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a compact internal space of positive curvature . in section 3",
    "we briefly describe the geometry of nearly khler manifolds as far as it is needed in our investigation .",
    "section 4 takes @xmath8 to be one of the four known compact homogeneous six - dimensional nearly khler manifolds and performs a systematic analysis of possible solutions of the field equations .",
    "we also check which of these solutions preserve supersymmetry .",
    "finally , in section 5 our results are summarized in three tables , which present the geometrical and field data as well as the fermion masses for all solutions , while some interesting properties are discussed as well .",

    "thus although it provides an extra freedom to solve the killing spinor equations and the bianchi identity @xcite , this freedom is lost at the level of the equations of motion .",
    "it goes without saying that the equations of motion and the absence of anomalies are more fundamental than the supersymmetry equations .",
    "therefore , in the present paper we worked at the level of the equations of motion and the bianchi identity at first order in @xmath2 , allowing for non - vanishing supersymmetry variations .",
    "our basic assumptions were threefold : ( 1 )  the @xmath1-flux is identified with the torsion of the internal space , ( 2 )  the gauge field is a generalized instanton   and ( 3 )  gaugino and dilatino bilinears may develop a vacuum expectation value . it is interesting that under these assumptions it was possible to fully classify the consistent vacua of the theory on nearly khler manifolds , regardless of their remnant supersymmetry .",
    "this examination resulted in the solutions appearing in the above tables .",
    "the introduction of a dilatino condensate clearly brings up more solutions than before , albeit non - supersymmetric ones .",
    "a further interesting issue is that all our solutions fix the radius of ads@xmath0 as well as the volume modulus @xmath198 of the internal nearly khler space .",
    "this provides a partial moduli stabilization in four dimensions .",
    "as far as the rest of the moduli are concerned , i.e.  the four - dimensional dilaton and the khler moduli of the compactification , their stabilization may be studied within the effective scalar potential in the four - dimensional theory .",
    "this potential was partially determined for nearly khler manifolds in @xcite in the absence of fermion condensates .",
    "the presence of fermion condensates typically leads to an effective component in the four - dimensional superpotential , which is known at least for the gaugino condensates @xcite .",
    "this effective superpotential may assist the stabilization of the dilaton in four dimensions @xcite .",
    "since generically supersymmetry is broken , the gaugino and the dilatino acquire non - vanishing masses .",
    "these masses depend on the internal geometry and are calculable as we have demonstrated .",
    "it is worth noting that in the single supersymmetric case on @xmath224 the gaugino mass vanishes , as expected , while the dilatino mass squares to @xmath326 . as a potentially interesting feature of our analysis ,",
    "the stabilization of the internal scale allows one to calculate the fermion masses explicitly in terms of the string scale .",
