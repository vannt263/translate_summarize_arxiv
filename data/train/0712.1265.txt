    "as first noticed by peierls @xcite , collective physical phenomena in an environment with a reduced number of dimensions can be dramatically changed with respect to our experience in three dimensions .",
    "the example of bose - einstein condensation in a uniform gas is a good illustration of the crucial role of dimensionality . in three dimensions ( 3d )",
    ", condensation occurs at a finite temperature , and the phase of the macroscopic wave function exhibits long range order @xcite . in two dimensions ,",
    "such long range order is destroyed by thermal fluctuations at any finite temperature , both for an ideal and for an interacting bose gas @xcite .    in presence of repulsive interactions between particles ,",
    "a uniform 2d bose gas can nevertheless undergo a phase transition from a normal to a superfluid state at a finite critical temperature .",
    "this transition was predicted by berezinskii @xcite and by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite ( bkt ) , and it has been observed in several macroscopic quantum systems , such as helium films adsorbed on a substrate @xcite .",
    "the superfluid state exhibits quasi - long range order , such that the one - body correlation function decays algebraically at large distance . by contrast",
    "the decay is exponential in the normal phase .",
    "the recent advances in the manipulation of quantum atomic gases have made it possible to address the properties of low - dimensional bose gases with novel tools and diagnostic techniques @xcite ( for recent reviews , see @xcite ) .",
    "a recent cold atom experiment also addressed the bkt problem by realizing a two - dimensional array of atomic josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "all these systems bring new questions , since one is now dealing with a harmonically trapped , instead of a uniform , fluid . in particular ,",
    "due to a different density of states , even in 2d one expects to recover the bose - einstein condensation phenomenon in the ideal bose gas case @xcite .",
    "the total number of atoms in the excited states of the trap is bounded from above , and a macroscopic population of the ground state appears for large enough atom numbers .",
    "however real atomic gases do interact .",
    "it is therefore a challenging question to understand whether in presence of atomic interactions , a trapped bose gas will undergo a bkt superfluid transition like in the uniform case , or whether conventional bose - einstein condensation will take place , as for an ideal system .    in recent experiments performed in our laboratory @xcite , a gas of rubidium atoms",
    "was trapped using a combination of a magnetic trap providing harmonic confinement in the @xmath1 plane , and an optical lattice , ensuring that the third degree of freedom ( @xmath2 ) of the gas was frozen .",
    "the analysis of the atomic density profile revealed a critical point , between a high temperature phase with a single component density distribution , and a low temperature phase with a clear bimodal distribution @xcite .",
    "this critical point also corresponded to the onset of clearly visible interferences between independent gases , which were used to study the coherence properties of the system @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the density profile of the normal component was observed to be close to a gaussian all the way down ( in temperature ) to the critical point .",
    "this density profile is strikingly different from the one expected for the ideal gas close to the bec critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , if the width of the observed quasi - gaussian distribution is interpreted as an empirical measure of the temperature , this leads to a critical atom number at a given temperature which is about five times larger than that needed for conventional bose - einstein condensation in the ideal gas .",
    "these two facts showed that , in sharp contrast to the 3d case , interactions in 2d can not be treated as a minor correction to the ideal gas bec picture , but rather qualitatively change the behavior of the system .",
    "the main goal of the present paper is to analyze this critical point .",
    "we start in   [ sec : ideal2d ] with a brief review of the properties of an ideal bose gas in the uniform case and in the case of harmonic confinement . in   [ sec : ideallattice ] we adapt the ideal gas treatment to the experimental geometry of @xcite , and provide a detailed calculation showing that the experimental results can not be explained by this theory .",
    "next , in ",
    "[ sec : interactions ] , we take interactions into account at the mean - field ( mf ) level and we combine this analysis with the numerically known threshold for the bkt transition in the uniform case @xcite .",
    "we first present a mf treatment for a strictly 2d gas . for the parameter range",
    "explored experimentally , it leads to a critical atom number in good agreement with the prediction of the most recent quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations @xcite .",
    "however the predicted mf density profiles significantly differ from the qmc ones in the vicinity of the critical point . in a second step ,",
    "we take into account the residual excitation of the @xmath2 motion in the mean - field model and we obtain an excellent agreement with the qmc calculation . the predicted density distribution near the critical point",
    "has a quasi - gaussian shape and the  empirical \" temperature extracted from this distribution is in fact somewhat lower than the real temperature . taking this into account we obtain good quantitative agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions .",
    "finally we summarize our findings and discuss the connection between the bec and the bkt transition in a 2d gas .",
    "while in a uniform , infinite system only the latter can occur at finite temperature , in a trapped gas both are possible , and the bec transition can be viewed as a special , non - interacting limit of the more general bkt behavior .",
    "this section is devoted to a review of well known results concerning the ideal bose gas in two dimensions .",
    "we first address the case of a uniform system at the thermodynamic limit , and we then consider a gas confined in a harmonic potential .      in the thermodynamic limit a uniform , ideal bose gas does not undergo bose - einstein condensation when the temperature @xmath3 is reduced , or the 2d spatial density @xmath4 is increased .",
    "bose - einstein statistics leads to the following relation between the phase space density @xmath5 and the fugacity @xmath6 @xmath7 here @xmath8 is the thermal wavelength , @xmath9 is the atomic mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the chemical potential .",
    "the function @xmath12 is the polylogarithm , that takes the simple form @xmath13 for @xmath14 . because @xmath15 when @xmath16 , ( [ eq : uniform2d ] ) has a solution in @xmath17 for any value of @xmath18 .",
    "hence no singularity appears in the distribution of the population of the single particle levels , even when the gas is strongly degenerate ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the well known 3d case : the relation @xmath20 ceases to have a solution for a phase space density above the critical value @xmath21 , where the 3d bose - einstein condensation phenomenon takes place .",
    "we now consider an ideal gas confined in a harmonic potential @xmath22 .",
    "we assume that thermal equilibrium has been reached , so that the population of each energy level is given by bose - einstein statistics .",
    "since the chemical potential @xmath11 is always lower than the energy @xmath23 of the ground state of the trap , the number of atoms @xmath24 occupying the excited states of the trap can not exceed the critical value @xmath25 @xmath26 this expression can be evaluated in the so - called _ semi - classical limit _ @xmath27 by replacing the discrete sum by an integral over the energy ranging from @xmath28 to @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",
    "this result also holds in the case of an anisotropic harmonic potential in the @xmath1 plane , in which case @xmath32 is replaced by the geometric mean @xmath33 , where @xmath34 are the two eigenfrequencies of the trap .",
    "the saturation of the number of atoms in the excited states is a direct manifestation of bose - einstein condensation : any total atom number @xmath35 above @xmath25 must lead to the accumulation of at least @xmath36 in the ground state of the trap",
    ".    equation ( [ eq : idealtrapped2 ] ) is very reminiscent of the result for the harmonically trapped 3d gas , where the saturation number is @xmath37 .",
    "however an important difference arises between the 2d and the 3d cases for the spatial density profile . in 3d",
    "the phase space density in @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "the threshold for bose - einstein condensation is reached for @xmath41 ; at this point @xmath35 is equal to the critical number @xmath42 and simultaneously the phase space density at the center of the trap @xmath43 equals the critical value @xmath44 .",
    "this allows for a simple connection between the bec thresholds for a homogenous gas and for a trapped system in the semi - classical limit @xmath40 . in 2d such a simple connection between global properties ( critical atom number @xmath25 ) and local properties ( critical density at center @xmath45 ) does not exist .",
    "indeed the semi - classical expression of the 2d phase space density is @xmath46 because @xmath47 this leads to a diverging value at the center of the trap when @xmath17 approaches 1 .",
    "therefore , although the integral of @xmath48 over the whole space converges for @xmath41 and allows to recover ( [ eq : idealtrapped2 ] ) , the semiclassical result ( [ eq:2didealphasespace ] ) can not be used to derive a local criterion for condensation at the center of the trap .",
    "one can go beyond the semi - classical approximation and calculate numerically the central phase space density as a function of the total number of atoms .",
    "we consider as an example the trap parameters used in @xcite , where @xmath49  hz , @xmath50  hz . in the typical case @xmath51 ( @xmath52  nk ) , the discrete summation of the bose - einstein occupation factors for @xmath41 gives @xmath53 ( the value obtained from the semi - classical result ( [ eq : idealtrapped2 ] ) is 4100 ) . using the expression of the energy eigenstates ( hermite functions )",
    ", we also calculate the phase space density at the origin and we find @xmath54 .",
    "let us emphasize that this value is a mere result of the finite size of the system , and does not have any character of universality .",
    "in order to produce a quasi two - dimensional gas experimentally , one needs to freeze the motion along one direction of space , say @xmath2 . in practice this is conveniently done using the potential @xmath55 created by an optical lattice along this direction . a precise comparison between the measured critical atom number and the prediction for an ideal gas requires to properly model the confining potential and find its energy levels .",
    "this is the purpose of the present section .",
    "the optical lattice is formed by two running laser waves of wavelength @xmath56 , propagating in the @xmath57 plane with an angle @xmath58 with respect to the @xmath59 axis .",
    "the period @xmath60 of the lattice along the @xmath2 direction can be adjusted to any value above @xmath61 by a proper choice of the angle @xmath62 . for a blue - detuned lattice ( @xmath56 is smaller than the atomic resonance wavelength ) ,",
    "@xmath63 is positive and the atoms accumulate in the vicinity of the nodal planes @xmath64 , @xmath65 , etc .",
    "the oscillation frequency at the bottom of the lattice wells is @xmath66 , where @xmath67 . in order for the quasi-2d regime to be reached , @xmath68 must notably exceed the typical thermal energy @xmath69 as well as the interaction energy per particle for a non ideal gas .    for a blue detuned lattice an additional confinement in the @xmath1 plane must be added to the optical lattice potential .",
    "this is conveniently achieved using a magnetic trap , that creates a harmonic potential with frequencies @xmath34 .",
    "the magnetic trap also provides an additional trapping potential @xmath70 along the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the oscillation frequency @xmath71 created by the magnetic trap is usually much lower than the one created by the lattice @xmath72 .",
    "the main effect of the magnetic confinement along the @xmath2 direction is to localize the atoms in the @xmath73 central lattice planes , where the effective number of planes @xmath74 .",
    "as we see below this number is on the order of 2 to 4 for the range of parameters explored in @xcite .",
    "the fact that more than just one plane is populated is an important ingredient of the experimental procedure used in @xcite .",
    "it allows one to look for the interferences between planes , and to access in this way the spatial coherence of the quasi-2d gas .    in order to extract thermodynamic information from the interference between planes",
    ", one must ensure that the various populated planes have the same temperature .",
    "this is achieved by using finite size lattice beams in the @xmath1 plane , so that atoms in the high energy tail of the thermal distribution can actually travel quasi freely from one plane to the other , thus ensuring thermalization . in the experiments described in @xcite ,",
    "the waist @xmath75 of the lattice beams along the @xmath76 direction was chosen accordingly .",
    "the total trapping potential can then be written in the following way @xmath77 with @xmath78 note that we have included here the offset @xmath79 between the optical lattice and the bottom of the magnetic potential ; this quantity was not set to a fixed value in the experiments @xcite .",
    "we consider below two limiting situations : ( a ) @xmath80 , with two principal equivalent minima in @xmath81 , ( b ) @xmath82 , with one principal minimum in @xmath64 and two side minima in @xmath83 . at very low temperatures",
    ", we expect that a will lead to two equally populated planes whereas configuration b will lead to one populated plane . for the temperature range considered in practice , the differences between the predictions for a and b are minor , as we will see below .      in order to use the bose - einstein statistics for an ideal gas",
    ", one needs to know the position of the single particle energy levels . for the potential ( [ eq : totalpot ] ) it is not possible to find an exact analytical expression of these levels .",
    "however if the extension of the atomic motion along the @xmath76 direction is smaller than the laser waist , an approximate expression can be readily obtained , as we show now .",
    "the frequencies of the magnetic trap used in @xcite are @xmath85  hz and @xmath86  hz . the optical lattice has a period @xmath87 m ( @xmath88  hz ) and a potential height at center @xmath89  khz ( @xmath90k ) . the lattice oscillation frequency at center ( @xmath91 ) is thus @xmath92  khz ( @xmath93  nk ) .",
    "when the atoms occupy the ground state of the @xmath2 motion , they acquire the zero - point energy @xmath94 from the @xmath95degree of freedom .",
    "the dependance on @xmath76 of @xmath96 , due to the gaussian term @xmath97 in the laser intensity , causes a renormalization of the @xmath76 frequency : @xmath98 the waist of the lattice beams is @xmath99 m which leads to @xmath100  hz .",
    "a similar effect should in principle be taken into account for the frequency @xmath101 .",
    "however the scale of variation of the laser intensity along the @xmath59 axis is the rayleigh length , which is much larger than the waist @xmath75 , and the effect is negligible .",
    "this simple way of accounting for the finiteness of the waist @xmath75 is valid when the extension of the motion along @xmath76 is small compared to @xmath75 .",
    "for @xmath102  nk , the width of the thermal distribution along @xmath76 is @xmath103 m , which is indeed notably smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "taking into account the finiteness of @xmath75 by a mere reduction of the trapping frequency along @xmath76 is therefore valid for the major part of the energy distribution .",
    "we note however that atoms in the high energy tail of the distribution ( @xmath104 for our largest temperatures ) can explore the region @xmath105 , where the influence of the lattice beams is strongly reduced . in this region",
    "the atoms can move from one lattice plane to the other .",
    "as explained above these atoms play an important role by ensuring full thermalization between the various planes .",
    "we now turn to an accurate treatment of the critical atom number required for bose - einstein condensation , taking into account these high energy levels for which the 2d approximation is not valid .      in order to get the single particle energy eigenstates in the lattice + harmonic potential confinement , and thus the critical atom number",
    ", one could perform a numerical diagonalization of the 3d hamiltonian with the potential ( [ eq : totalpot ] ) .",
    "this is however a computationally involved task and it is preferable to take advantage of the well separated energy scales in the problem .",
    "we first note that the trapping potential ( [ eq : totalpot ] ) is the sum of a term involving the variables @xmath76 and @xmath2 , and a quadratic component in @xmath59 .",
    "the motion along the @xmath59 axis can then be separated from the @xmath106 problem , and it is easily taken into account thanks to its harmonic character . for treating the @xmath106 problem we use a ` born - oppenheimer ' type approximation .",
    "we exploit the fact that the characteristic frequencies of the @xmath2 motion are in any point @xmath76 notably larger than the frequency of the @xmath76 motion .",
    "this is of course true inside the lattice laser waist , since @xmath107 , and it is also true outside the laser waist as the @xmath76 direction corresponds to the weak axis of our magnetic trap .",
    "therefore we can proceed in two steps :    1 .   for any fixed @xmath76",
    "we numerically find the eigenvalues @xmath108 , @xmath109 of the @xmath2 motion in the @xmath110 potential .",
    "we determine the @xmath111 s up to the threshold @xmath112 above which the thermal excitation of the levels is negligible .",

    "the restriction to the closest - to - center lattice plane and to the first @xmath2-level is legitimate , and the sum over @xmath119 contains only one significant term corresponding to ( [ eq:2didealphasespace ] ) .",

    "the sum over @xmath119 in ( [ eq : maglatresult ] ) leads to @xmath121 , which coincides with the 3d result @xmath39 when integrated along @xmath2 .",
    "of course this procedure also allows to interpolate between these two limiting cases , which is the desired outcome .",
    "the integral of @xmath4 in the @xmath1 plane for @xmath122 gives the critical atom number @xmath123 in the ideal gas model for this lattice geometry .",
    "it is shown in figure [ fig : nc_lattice]a for the two configurations a and b.    the critical atom number @xmath124 can be compared with the result for a single plane @xmath25 with eigenfrequencies @xmath125 and @xmath101 .",
    "the ratio gives the effective number of planes @xmath126 , shown as a function of temperature in figure [ fig : nc_lattice]b for the two configurations a and b. this ratio increases with temperature , which means that @xmath124 increases faster than @xmath127 with temperature in the temperature domain considered here .",

    "second , we are exploring here a region of temperature where @xmath131 becomes non negligible with respect to @xmath132 ( the two quantities are equal for @xmath133  nk ) , and the thermal excitations of the @xmath2-motion in each lattice plane can not be fully neglected .",
    "third , for the largest considered temperatures , the extension of the atomic motion along @xmath76 becomes comparable to the laser waist , and the lattice strength is then significantly reduced .     in the ideal gas model for the optical lattice + magnetic trap configuration , as a function of temperature .",

    "each critical point ( @xmath136 ) was defined as the place where a bimodal spatial distribution appeared , if the atom number was increased beyond this point at constant temperature , or the temperature reduced at constant atom number .",
    "the critical point also corresponded to the threshold for the appearance of interferences with a significant contrast between adjacent planes .",

    "in addition to this large discrepancy between experiment and ideal gas model for the critical atom numbers , one also finds a strong mismatch concerning the functional shape of the column density @xmath138 that was measured in absorption imaging in @xcite . while the experimental result is quasi - gaussian , the column density profiles calculated for an ideal gas at the critical point are much ` peakier ' .",
    "an example is given in the appendix for a single plane , and we checked that a similar shape remains valid for our harmonic + lattice potential .",

    "we start our discussion with a brief reminder of the role of ( weak ) interactions in a trapped 3d bose gas @xcite .",

    "the phase space density in @xmath148 is thus a solution of @xmath149 .",

    "for a trapped 2d gas this treatment based on a local criterion ( phase space density at center ) can not be used .",
    "indeed as explained in section [ subsec : ideal2dtrap ] , it is not possible to identify a critical phase space density at which bec of the 2d gas is expected . on the contrary the semiclassical approximation leads to an infinite central density at the critical point , and it is unclear whether one can achieve an arbitrarily large spatial density in presence of repulsive interactions",
    ".    one could also look for a global criterion for criticality based on the total atom number .",
    "the starting point is the solution of the mean - field equation @xmath151 with @xmath152 .",
    "when @xmath153 , we saw in ",
    "[ sec : ideal2d ] that the solution of ( [ eq:2dhartreefock ] ) can only accommodate a finite number of atoms ( [ eq : idealtrapped2 ] ) .",
    "however the situation is dramatically changed in presence of repulsive interactions .",
    "indeed for any non zero @xmath154 , a solution to ( [ eq:2dhartreefock ] ) exists for arbitrarily large atom numbers @xcite .",
    "consequently no critical point can be found by simply searching for a maximal atom number compatible with ( [ eq:2dhartreefock ] ) . in the following",
    "we will therefore turn to a different approach , starting from the known exact ( i.e. non mean - field ) results concerning the critical bkt point in a uniform interacting 2d bose gas .",
    "the mean - field approximation will be used in a second stage , in combination with the local density approximation ( lda ) , to determine the critical atom number in the trapped system .",
    "note that it is also possible to pursue the search for a critical point only within the mean - field approach , by looking for example whether its solution exhibits a thermodynamical or dynamical instability above a critical atom number @xcite .",
    "this instability would be an indication that the system tends to evolve towards a different kind of state , with a non - zero quasi - condensed and/or superfluid component , and quasi - long range order @xcite .      in an infinite uniform 2d bose fluid ,",
    "repulsive interactions have a dramatic effect since they can induce a transition from the normal to the superfluid state , when the temperature is lowered below a critical value .",
    "the superfluid density jumps from 0 to @xmath155 at the transition point @xcite .",
    "the microscopic mechanism of the 2d superfluid transition has been elucidated by berezinskii @xcite and by kosterlitz and thouless @xcite .",
    "for a temperature larger than the critical temperature , free vortices proliferate in the gas , destroying the superfluidity . below the transition , vortices exist only in the form of bound pairs involving two vortices of opposite circulations , which have little influence on the superfluid properties of the system .    in a uniform system",
    "the phase space density @xmath18 is a function of the chemical potential and temperature @xmath156 . for any given @xmath3 ,",
    "the superfluid transition occurs when @xmath11 is equal to a critical value @xmath157 .",

    "<S> we analyze the results of a recent experiment with bosonic rubidium atoms harmonically confined in a quasi - two - dimensional geometry . in this experiment a well defined critical point was identified , which separates the high - temperature normal state characterized by a single component density distribution , and the low - temperature state characterized by a bimodal density distribution and the emergence of high - contrast interference between independent two - dimensional clouds . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that this transition can not be explained in terms of conventional bose - einstein condensation of the trapped ideal bose gas . using the local density approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we then combine the mean - field ( mf ) hartree - fock theory with the prediction for the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless transition in an infinite uniform system . </S>",
    "<S> if the gas is treated as a strictly 2d system , the mf predictions for the spatial density profiles significantly deviate from those of a recent quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) analysis . </S>",
    "<S> however when the residual thermal excitation of the strongly confined degree of freedom is taken into account , an excellent agreement is reached between the mf and the qmc approaches . </S>",
    "<S> for the interaction strength corresponding to the experiment , we predict a strong correction to the critical atom number with respect to the ideal gas theory ( factor @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative agreement between theory and experiment is reached concerning the critical atom number if the predicted density profiles are used for temperature calibration . </S>"
