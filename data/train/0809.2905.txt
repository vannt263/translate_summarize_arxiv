    "both level density and @xmath0-ray strength function are inputs in statistical model calculations of compound nuclear reactions and the subsequent decay of the compound system .",
    "these calculations are important for many aspects of nuclear structure studies , e.g. , fission hindrance in heavy nuclei , giant resonances built on excited states , yields of evaporation residues to populate certain exotic nuclei and production of heavy elements in stellar processes .",
    "the level density is also an essential quantity for determining thermodynamic properties of nuclei , such as entropy and temperature  quantities that describe the many - particle behavior of the system .",
    "the level density is defined as the number of levels per unit of excitation energy .",
    "it can be obtained experimentally from different methods such as counting of resonances following neutron capture  @xcite and modeling of particle evaporation spectra from compound nucleus reactions  @xcite .",

    "the oslo method has previously been applied for rare earth nuclei , obtaining information on the level density and average @xmath0-decay properties in this mass region  @xcite .",
    "recently , the method has been extended to other mass regions like fe , mo , v and sc  @xcite . in order to check the validity of the method in cases where nuclei have low level density and strong porter - thomas fluctuations  @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath10si nuclei were studied with gratifying results  @xcite .",

    "the basic assumption may not be fulfilled if the direct reaction at lower excitation bins , whose @xmath0-spectra are utilized to subtract higher - generation @xmath0-rays from total spectra at higher excitation energies , do not favor some levels within the excitation bin that are populated by @xmath0-rays from above . such situations may cause that some @xmath0-rays are not fully subtracted from the total spectrum .    the influence of a possible different selectivity of levels at one excitation energy in the direct reaction compared to @xmath0-decay from higher lying levels ,",
    "is expected to be most pronounced when only a few levels are present in the excitation bin .",
    "thus , these considerations are increasingly important for nuclei in the vicinity of closed shells having low level density .",
