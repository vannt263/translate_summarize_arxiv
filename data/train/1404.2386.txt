    "the purpose of this paper is two - fold . the first aim is motivated by the general principle that when there exist major results for a semilinear elliptic boundary value problem , then if we formulate a reasonable discretization of this boundary value problem with a view to finding approximate solutions , then there should exist analogous results for the corresponding discretized problem .",
    "a typical example of this idea may be found in @xcite .    a well - known theorem of gidas , ni , and nirenberg , @xcite , states roughly that positive solutions of the semi linear elliptic boundary value problem @xmath9 inherit symmetries of the domain @xmath10 .",
    "for example , if @xmath10 is a ball , then all positive solutions must be radially symmetric",
    ". if @xmath10 is a hypercube , then all positive solutions must be symmetric about the bisecting hyperplanes .",
    "it is natural to ask whether there is a corresponding result for the corresponding discretized problem . in other words ,",
    "if we replace the laplacian in equation with the corresponding finite difference laplacian ( @xmath11 is the standard basis of @xmath12 and @xmath13 stand for the mesh sizes ) @xmath14 we obtain the following finite difference version of @xmath15 the questions is : does a discrete solution satisfy the same type of symmetries ? ( assuming , of course , that the discretized grid reflects these symmetries . )",
    "the answer is no , even in one dimension .",
    "easy counterexamples of this can be found in @xcite .",
    "the problem is that there is no restriction on the mesh size .",
    "one should only expect the ( positive ) solutions of equation ( 2 ) to reflect those of equation ( 1 ) when the mesh sizes are _",
    "small_.    this gives a clue to the correct result , also in @xcite , which can be roughly summarized as follows ; _ as the space step of the discretization becomes small , the solutions @xmath16 become approximately symmetric .",
    "_ concrete estimates of the distance from symmetry are given in terms of the difference between the solution and its reflection about the bisecting hyperplane .",
    "full details can be found in @xcite .",
    "this is an example of the general principle mentioned above .",
    "if the discretization is sufficiently fine , the properties of the continuous solution of ( 1 ) should be reflected in the properties of the discretized solution of ( 2 ) .",
    "of course , several technical assumptions , both on the lipschitz constants for @xmath17 and the behavior of the approximate solutions @xmath16 are required .",
    "one key assumption was that there exists @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "since this can often be obtained for a wide variety of nonlinearities via the discrete maximum principle , we felt , at the time , that this assumption was not unreasonable , and indeed natural in the numerical context .",
    "after all , if @xmath20 as a subsequence of the @xmath21 , one would naturally think that we were not in the neighborhood of a true classical or weak solution .",
    "however , as recently observed in @xcite and @xcite , the blow - up of the @xmath22-norm of a family of finite - difference solutions may indicate the existence of an unbounded distributional solution induced by a supercritical exponent in the nonlinearity , cf .",
    "remark ( a ) after theorem  [ main ] .",
    "however , there is another large class of nonlinearities , to which the maximum principle is not applicable , but for which the true solutions of can be shown to satisfy a priori bounds .",
    "a summary of these results are to be found in @xcite .",
    "to extend some of the results of @xcite to a discrete setting is the second aim of this paper .",
    "these are the two goals mentioned at the beginning of this introduction .",
    "first , proving these a priori estimates will achieve the aim of proving corresponding results for solutions of the discretized problems .",
    "second , it will extend to a much wider class of nonlinearities the approximate symmetry results of @xcite .",
    "a priori estimates will be proven for positive solutions of the following generalization of @xmath23 where @xmath24 is an @xmath4-dimensional box and @xmath3 are the finitely many points of a suitable mesh belonging to @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath25 , @xmath26 and assume that there are continuous functions @xmath27 , @xmath28 and a constant @xmath29 such that    1 .",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 is strictly increasing and with @xmath32 one has @xmath33 2 .",
    "@xmath34 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath35 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath36 , which is independent of the mesh size @xmath37 , such that if @xmath38 is a non - negative solution of then @xmath39 .",
    "[ main_1d ]    [ main ] let @xmath6 and let @xmath40 be a bounded @xmath4-dimensional box .",
    "suppose there exist constants @xmath41 and @xmath42 such that    * @xmath43 for all @xmath44 and all @xmath45 and for @xmath46 , * @xmath47 for some @xmath48",
    ".    then there exists a constant @xmath36 , which is independent of the mesh size @xmath37 , such that if @xmath49 is a non - negative solution of then @xmath39 .",
    "* remarks . *",
    "( a ) let us explain the role of the exponent @xmath8 from the point of view of differential equations rather then difference equations . as it has been shown in @xcite ,",
    "the exponent @xmath50 is a critical exponent for @xmath4-dimensional boxes in the following sense : if @xmath51 then every very - weak solution ( a special form of a distributional solution ) of @xmath52 in @xmath10 with @xmath53 on @xmath54 is in fact classical and if it is additionally positive then its @xmath0-norm is uniformly bounded .",
    "in contrast , for some @xmath55 one can construct unbounded very - weak solutions of the problem . hence @xmath50 separates ( uniformly ) bounded solutions from unbounded very - weak solutions .",
    "now , in the finite difference context , we meet the same exponent .",
    "we believe that for some @xmath55 one can construct a family of solutions of finite - difference boundary value problems of the above type where the @xmath0-norm of the solution tends to infinity as the mesh - size @xmath37 tends to zero . some numerical evidence ( in a finite - element context ,",
    "however ) is given in @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) for the one - dimensional as well as for the higher - dimensional case explicit upper estimates for the value of @xmath36 are immediate from the proofs . since the formulas are highly complex we decided against writing the details . however , let us point out how such a formula is constructed : at the end of the proof of theorem  [ main ] an explicity upper bound for the @xmath56-norm of the discrete gradient of a solution @xmath57 is obtained , cf . formula .",
    "if this is inserted into the result of theorem  [ moser_nonlinear ] then one obtains an _",
    "explicit _ upper bound for the @xmath0-norm of the solution @xmath57 .",
    "the plan of this paper is to first set up , the discretized version of equation in section 2 , and then in section 3 to describe the discrete function spaces in which we prove the a priori estimates .",
    "also in section 3 we state a number of important inequalities ( poincar s inequality , sobolev s inequality , hardy s inequality ) .",
    "the proof of theses inequalities is given in the appendix . in section 4",
    "we treat the one - dimensional case and give the proof of theorem  [ main_1d ] .",
    "it is conceptually much different from the treatment of the higher - dimensional case .",
    "this is done in section 5 with the essential ingredient of the hardy - sobolev inequality ( cf .",
    "@xcite where it is used to the same effect of obtaining @xmath0 a - priori bounds ) and moser s iteration scheme , which we adapt to the finite - difference context .",
    "we conclude with some remarks on some possible extensions and open questions .    a final remark before we begin . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the following notation .",
    "for @xmath58 let @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath11 be the standard basis of @xmath12 and let @xmath61 be the mesh size vector of a uniform mesh @xmath62 .",
    "we use the short - hand @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "consider a ( possibly unbounded ) @xmath4-dimensional euclidean box ( also called hypercube ) @xmath65 together with its closure @xmath66 and boundary @xmath54 .",
    "we assume that @xmath67 note that we allow @xmath10 to have unbounded directions . for a box @xmath10",
    "let us define discretizations of @xmath66 , @xmath10 and @xmath54 : @xmath68 if @xmath10 is bounded , we also define @xmath69 a finer description of the discrete boundary @xmath70 is given as follows : @xmath71 let @xmath72 be a given function .",

    "the discrete laplace operator of @xmath57 at @xmath77 is given by @xmath78    a function @xmath79 is said to have compact support if and only if the set @xmath80 is bounded and @xmath81 .",

    "we compute @xmath96 where the last equality holds since the first sum @xmath97 vanishes and the second summand @xmath98 has no contribution outside @xmath3 because @xmath89 vanishes there .",

    "the sequence is also a cauchy sequence in @xmath129 and hence convergent , i.e. @xmath130 as @xmath131 .",
    "moreover , from the definition of @xmath132 it follows that for each @xmath74 the sequence @xmath133 is a cauchy sequence in @xmath134 and hence convergent , i.e. , there exist functions @xmath135 such that @xmath136 as @xmath131 in the sense of @xmath56-convergence .",

    "this implies @xmath137 and finishes the proof .",
    "next we give statements of four different discrete inequalities : poincar s inequality in theorem  [ poincare ] , a sobolev inequality in dimension @xmath144 in theorem  [ sobolev_embedd ] , a sobolev inequality in dimension 2 in theorem  [ sobolev_embedd_2d ] , and hardy s inequality in theorem  [ th : hardy_inequality ] .",
