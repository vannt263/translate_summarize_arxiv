    "an industrial mass production of nuclear emulsion was done for the first time for the opera experiment @xcite .",

    "the total amount of protons on target ( pot ) was 1.8 @xmath11 @xmath16 pot , corresponding to 80@xmath8 of the design value .",
    "the opera detector is a hybrid detector composed of two identical super modules ( sm ) as shown in fig.[fig-1 ] .",
    "the total target mass is 1.25 kton . in each sm",
    ", 75,000 ecc bricks were assembled into walls interleaved by two orthogonal planes of scintillator strips , the target tracker planes ( tt ) , used to identify the bricks in which the interactions occurred . each target",
    "is complemented by a spectrometer that identifies muons and measures their charge and momentum .",
    "the size of ecc brick is 12.8 cm @xmath11 10.2 cm @xmath11 7.9 cm .",
    "it is composed of 57 emulsion films ( 0.3 mm - thick ) interleaved with 56 lead plates ( 1 mm - thick ) .",
    "a film has a 44@xmath7 m emulsion layer deposited on each side of a 205 @xmath7 m plastic base .",
    "a separate box containing a pair of films , hereafter called changeable sheets or cs , is glued on the downstream face of each ecc brick in front of the next tt plane .",
    "the cs serve as interface between the brick and the tt , bringing the centimeter spatial resolution of the tt down to the @xmath7 m level . _ _",
    "the challenge in opera is the analysis of a large amount of emulsion films .",
    "the signal recorded by the electronic detectors , tt and muon spectrometers , is used to identify the bricks , most often one and up to 3 , in which a neutrino interaction is likely to have occurred .",
    "those bricks are extracted from the target by an automaton .",
    "cs are removed from their box , developed and analyzed , starting with the most probable brick .",
    "if tracks found on the cs are compatible with the electronic detector track , the brick is disassembled and its films developed .",
    "the tracks found in the cs are extrapolated to the most downstream emulsion film in ecc where they are searched for .",
    "they are then followed back from film to film up to the stopping point , where the tracks are not found in three consecutive films .",
    "a large volume around this point is scanned and analyzed , and the neutrino interaction vertex is reconstructed .",
    "currently , out of the 16,879 triggered events , 7,041 neutrino vertices are localized in ecc , 6,682 events are fully analyzed .",
    "the analysis procedure in the ecc had been well established in past experiments , chorus @xcite and donut @xcite .",
    "given the large amount of emulsion scanning and analysis necessary for the opera experiment , newly developed emulsion analysis techniques played an essential role .",
    "the details will be described below .",
    "s - uts , ess + in modern analysis of nuclear emulsions , the analysis speed has been dramatically improved due to the development of devices to automatically scan nuclear emulsions .",
    "the scanning speed of previous systems applied to donut was 1 @xmath17/hour .",

    "the scanning speed of the ess ( european scanning system ) @xcite is 20 @xmath17/hour and a total of 33 such systems have been run in europe .",
    "such significant improvement of scanning speed allow a large amount of emulsion data taking .",
    "compton alignment + cs is constituted of two opera films and has four emulsion layers .",
    "a few tracks emerging from the ecc are expected to be recorded by the cs for each neutrino interaction .",
    "however @xmath510@xmath18 tracks on each layer are read out with scanning systems .",
    "the majority of them are not `` real '' or high momentum tracks from neutrino interactions , but so - called `` fake '' tracks which are due to low momentum electrons ( @xmath5mev ) from radioactive source . by the cs analysis , it is possible to extract a few real tracks among such a huge number of fake tracks .",
    "the first step of fake track rejection is to require coincidence over 4 layers using 3 dimensional emulsion track data . by this requirement",
    ", background is limited to @xmath510@xmath19 tracks for cs .    new precise alignment method @xcite between cs films uses fake tracks ( low momentum electrons ) which cross the contacting surface between emulsion layers .",
    "background electrons , called compton electrons , are used for alignment instead of x - ray marks .",
    "the alignment accuracy of this new and conventional method is about 2 @xmath20 m and 6 - 8 @xmath20 m , respectively with an improvement by a factor of 3 - 4 .",
    "the background level is reduced by a factor of 10 without any efficiency degradation .",
    "track ranking + an ultimated s / n discrimination method of emulsion analysis is direct human eye check with a microscope . by human eye",
    "it is possible to recognize the scattered , not straight , fake tracks of low energy electron and distinguish real tracks from fake tracks .",
    "however human eye check takes about 1 min./track . in opera , it is feasible to apply such an eye check on 10 - 20 tracks on each cs at a rate of about 20 css per day .",
    "new s / n discrimination method @xcite is based on a likelihood analysis of the emulsion tracks . the evaluation parameter is focused on `` the blackness '' and `` the linearity '' of 4 layer tracks on cs . the blackness and the linearity of real tracks is higher than for fake tracks .",
    "each track quality is calculated by the evaluation function with full degree of freedom ( 4 and 12 parameters for blackness and linearity , respectively ) . by applying this method as third step ,",
    "the s / n ratio on cs tracks is drastically improved by @xmath5100 times with only 1% efficiency loss .",
    "consequently fake tracks reduced to @xmath510 tracks on cs .",
    "furthermore , if there are tracks with highly ranking score , real tracks are automatically found and no eye check is performed .",
    "the four main decay channels of the @xmath6 lepton are @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath21 ( 17.4@xmath22 ) , @xmath7 ( 17.9@xmath22 ) , 1 hadron ( 49.5@xmath22 ) and 3 hadrons ( 15.2@xmath22 ) .",

    "the hadronic interactions become a background for the @xmath6 lepton decay in case the hadrons originated from the primary vertex in @xmath0nc event immediately interact .",

    "large angle track scanning + the hadronic background can be reduced by detecting nuclear fragments from a secondary vertex , since the existence of nuclear fragments is clear proof of a hadron interaction , not @xmath6 decay .",
