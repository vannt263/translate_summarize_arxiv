    "although the field theory has been studied for a long time , we have no complete understanding of relativistic bound state problems . we have to solve the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) nonperturbatively to investigate low - energy hadronic physics .",
    "the most reasonable nonperturbative method for such a problem is the lattice gauge theory . in the method , it is easy to calculate the lightest particle state , but not to evaluate the excited and scattering states .",
    "although there exist many nonperturbative prescriptions in the hamiltonian formalism , the formalism has been abandoned so far since lorentz invariance and the renormalizability are not obvious .",
    "the light - front ( lf ) tamm - dancoff field theory @xcite is known as a method based on the hamiltonian formalism .",
    "the hamiltonian is constructed by quantizing fields on the light - cone and truncating the fock space .",
    "the truncation is called the tamm - dancoff approximation @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the fock space is approximated as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 corresponds to the full theory .",
    "it is possible to calculate mass spectra nonperturbatively by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in the space .",
    "the resulting mass spectrum seems to be accurate for low - lying states , since the pair creation and annihilation are suppressed in the lf field theory@xcite , especially the pair creation of particles from the lf vacuum is kinematically prohibited .",
    "the prohibition warrants the truncation to be reliable .",
    "this is an advantage of this method , but , at the same time , it causes a problem .",
    "no pair creation means that the vacuum is trivial @xmath7 , i.e. , the vacuum is always symmetric in the lf field theory .",
    "this causes serious problems , because various phenomena are explained as results of spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) in the relativistic field theory .",
    "how can the lf field theory describe ssb ?",
    "it has been said that the zero - mode operator leads the lf field theory to ssb@xcite .",
    "we have a constraint equation for the zero - mode , if the system is quantized in a box with a periodic boundary condition .",
    "new interactions induced by the zero - mode affect the renormalization @xcite , independently of whether the symmetry breaks spontaneously or not .",
    "a relation between the zero - mode scenario and the conventional understanding based on the effective potential in the equal - time field theory is not clarified yet .",
    "there are several works @xcite for the two - dimensional real scalar model , in which the zero - mode constraint equation is solved under reasonable approximations to describe ssb of the @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "at least for the two - dimensional case , the light - front formulation seems to be consistent with the equal - time one , if the zero - mode contributions are treated properly .",
    "this approach to ssb has never been applied to higher dimensional models having ultraviolet divergences .    according to our previous work @xcite based on perturbation , the canonical hamiltonian yields a tachyonic spectrum for the broken phase owing to renormalization effects .",
    "we have to expand the field around the correct vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to restore positivity of the spectrum .",
    "there exists an rg invariant relation among vev and running parameters , and the vev is determined from the relation as a function of the original parameters .",
    "the broken phase is an rg invariant surface containing the critical line in the parameter space .",
    "the symmetry breaking interactions were originally introduced by perry and wilson in the coupling coherence study @xcite , but the instability of the canonical hamiltonian was not mentioned .    in this paper",
    ", we treat the real scalar model in three dimensions and propose a nonperturbative rg prescription based on the tamm - dancoff truncation .",
    "the theory is regularized by expanding wavefunctions in terms of basis functions in a truncated momentum space .",
    "the mass spectrum is then obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian within a space spanned by the basis functions . in actual calculations",
    "we take the fock space up to three - body states .",
    "it is discussed through wave functions whether the truncated space is large enough .",
    "the marginal coupling dependence of the critical line is also analyzed .",
    "a proper hamiltonian for the broken phase is constructed by shifting the field as @xmath2 .",
    "a relation of @xmath3 to the original parameters are nonperturbatively determined by searching the critical surface which gives a vanishing mass for the ground state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ shift ] , a qualitative aspect of mass spectra in the three - dimensional real scalar model is shown with perturbative bloch - horowitz rg analysis . in section [ basis ] , a regularization based on basis functions is introduced . in section",
    "[ numerical ] , numerical rg is carried out by using the nonperturbative regularization mentioned above .",
    "the section [ discussion ] is devoted to discussions .",

    "let us consider a hamiltonian regularized with some cut - off @xmath16 in order for a divergent theory to be well - defined .",
    "the einstein - schrdinger ( es ) equation for the hamiltonian is @xmath17 where @xmath18 are running parameters belonging to the model .",
    "we need a certain transformed hamiltonian which has a lowered cutoff @xmath19 and gives the same eigenvalue @xmath20 , @xmath21 we are now looking for a prescription to get transformed parameters @xmath22 which include radiative corrections . to do that , we use the following projection operators@xcite , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a total invariant mass ( @xmath25 ) of an intermediate fock state . the transformed hamiltonian , which gives a correct spectrum in the @xmath26 space , can be written formally as , @xmath27 this hamiltonian @xmath28 is called the bloch - horowitz effective hamiltonian and used in many - body problem for the purpose of reduction of the degrees of freedom which are too much to treat it directly@xcite .",
    "we expect that this hamiltonian effectively describes physics near the ground state .",
    "expanding the term @xmath29 with respect to the coupling constant , integrating over the higher invariant mass space @xmath30 and rescaling the lowered cutoff @xmath31 to the original one @xmath16 , we can write down rg equations for all parameters@xcite . the effective hamiltonian , however , contains a problem .",
    "the resultant rg equations seems to depend on the energy @xmath20 at a sight . in our previous work@xcite",
    ", we have shown perturbatively for the four - dimensional @xmath32 model that the energy dependence of rg equation is negligible at one - loop order if the cutoff is sufficiently large .",

    "this is equivalent to renormalization of tad - pole diagrams by redefining parameters .",

    "the intermediate mass @xmath24 is large because it sits in the higher mass space @xmath50 .",
    "then , @xmath51 is much smaller than @xmath52 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for the purpose to calculate a critical line and draw a phase diagram .",
    "we can observe from @xmath46 being negative that @xmath53 if the initial value @xmath54 is sufficiently large and @xmath55 if the initial value @xmath54 is small .",
    "that is , there exist a critical line @xmath56 in the first quadrant of the two dimensional parameter space @xmath57 , and @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspond to symmetric and asymmetric phases respectively . in the asymmetric phase ,",
    "the canonical hamiltonian ( [ canno ] ) is tachyonic , i.e. , square of eigenmass is not bounded from below although hamiltonian should be positive definite .",
    "positivity of the spectrum is restored by expanding the field @xmath39 around the correct vev @xmath3 . substituting @xmath60 into eq .",

    "the neglect of the marginal operator will be justified by numerical analyses shown later .",

    "all asymmetric hamiltonians on the surface describe physics for the broken phase .",
    "all running parameters on the surface go to zero in the limit @xmath67 which corresponds to infinite iterations of rg transformation , satisfying the rg invariant relation @xmath66 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath65 thus gives massless spectrum in the limit .",
    "all hamiltonians on the surface converge to the same massless hamiltonian in the limit , indicating that @xmath65 gives massless spectrum at any point on the surface .",
    "it is known for the real scalar models in three and four dimensions that the effective potential is convex and has flat bottom in the broken phase @xcite .",
    "we may choose any point in the flat region as a stable vacuum .",
    "it is likely that this fact supports the existence of a massless particle in the broken phase .",
    "we will continue our analysis with the fact in mind , that is , we find out the broken phase nonperturbatively by searching massless eigenvalues .",
    "the first principle of rg is to find a flow which gives the same physics .",
    "it is not easy to calculate the effective interaction part of the bloch - horowitz hamiltonian directly for our practical purpose of nonperturbative renormalization and we have to avoid energy dependences of renormalization , then we consider another approach . in our framework , we can draw rg flows by calculating spectra .",
