    "we demonstrate that these [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios are similar to those measured in surveys of uv - bright galaxies .",
    "we measure an average [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratio of 0.27 , corresponding to an average gas - phase oxygen abundance of 12+log(o / h ) = 8.57 - 8.87 , depending on the metallicity calibration adopted . taking figure 4 at face value",
    ", we would conclude that the m08 calibration gives the best match to the @xmath10 stellar abundances , and should therefore be preferred over the other calibrations . however , there are many sources of systematic uncertainty in this study .",
    "we first consider the sources of the differences in the three calibrations .",
    "the m08 oxygen abundance is calculated from a combination of the direct @xmath52 method for galaxies with log(o / h ) + 12 @xmath31 8.35 , and with strong line ratios and the photoionization models of kewley & dopita ( 2002 ) for log(o / h ) + 12 @xmath34 8.35 .",
    "d02 derives oxygen abundances primarily from the direct @xmath52 method , with roughly one third of their abundances from oxygen or sulfur strong line ratios .",
    "pp04 uses 97% direct @xmath52 abundances .",
    "all three studies then derive a relationship between [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratio and oxygen abundance .",
    "the spread in metallicity calibrations may be related to issues with the photoionization models , or temperature gradients and fluctuations that cause metallicities determined by the direct @xmath52 method to be underestimated ( peimbert 1967 ; kewley & ellison 2008 ) .",
    "observational studies of optical recombination lines show a systematic differences of @xmath53 dex with the @xmath52 method ( esteban et  al .",
    "2009 ) , which may explain some of the variation .",
    "there is also emerging evidence that , at high redshift , metallicities based on [ nii]/h@xmath2 are offset from those based on [ oii]@xmath13727 , [ oiii]@xmath54 and h@xmath55 , even within the same system of metallicity calibrations ( newman et  al .",
    "2013 ; cullen et  al .",
    "specifically , metallicities based on oxygen lines are @xmath56 dex lower than those based on nitrogen lines .",
    "this difference is attributed to different physical conditions in starforming regions at high redshift , and it is unclear which calibrations , if either , represents the  true \" gas - phase metallicity .",
    "another uncertainty in our study stems from the fact that , in addition to metallicity , [ nii ] flux is sensitive to the presence of both agn and shock excitation .",
    "it is unfortunately not possible to separate out agn contribution to the [ nii ] flux without high - resolution ifu data ( frster schreiber et  al .",
    "however , all detected galaxies in our sample have log([nii]/h@xmath2 ) @xmath31 -0.5 ; the theoretical high - redshift bpt diagram indicates that significant agn contribution in this regime is unlikely ( kewley et  al .",
    "2013 ) , though it may exist at a low level .",
    "it may also be that the stellar oxygen abundances are overestimated .",
    "the measurement of oxygen abundance in old unresolved stellar populations is notoriously difficult ( see conroy 2013 and references therein ) . in the conroy & van dokkum ( 2012 ) spectral model ,",
    "the oxygen abundance is primarily derived from a combination of tio lines and molecular equilibrium involving cno .",
    "the trend [ o / fe]@xmath19[mg / fe ] matches that as measured in the milky way ( edvardsson et  al .",
    "1993 , though see also bensby , feltzing , & oey 2013 ) , suggesting that the stellar oxygen abundance measurements are robust .",
    "we also consider the possibility of misidentification of the descendant galaxies .",
    "the predicted stellar mass evolution from @xmath0 to @xmath10 for these galaxies is + 0.4 dex .",
    "if instead the stellar mass evolution were + 0.1/+0.7 dex , this results in negligible change of -0.05/+0.05 dex in the oxygen abundance of their descendants .",
    "this is due to the flat relationship between the stellar mass and stellar metallicity ( panter et  al .",
    "this comparison is thus robust against errors in descendant matching .",
    "additionally , the stellar mass growth at this number density is primarily not through additional star formation , but rather accretion ( van dokkum et  al . 2010 ; patel et  al .",
    "these accreted galaxies presumably had lower metallicities than the main progenitor galaxy , which means that they would lower the total luminosity - weighted stellar metallicity ( greene et  al .",
    "2013 ) . taking this process into account would therefore , if anything , increase the discrepancy in figure [ metals ] .",
    "perhaps the most likely possibility is that selection by stellar mass may still be biased , in the sense that the most metal - rich galaxies do not have detectable emission lines .",
    "only 37.5% of our sample has detected emission lines ; furthermore , the galaxies without detected emission lines are not a random subset of the sample .",
    "the last two panels in figure [ ratios ] examine the different properties of detections and non - detections in our sample .",
    "galaxies with detected emission lines consistently have larger effective radii and higher sfrs than galaxies without detected emission lines .",
    "these properties are known to correlate with the gas - phase metallicity of the galaxies .",
    "for example , observations suggest that gas - phase metallicity and sfr are anticorrelated ( mannucci et  al .",

    "2004 ; ellison et  al .",
    "2008 ) .    even in galaxies with detected emission lines , some unknown fraction of the star formation may be obscured by dust .",
