    ". two configurations of the ion beams are considered in this work : perfectly collimated ( constant flux within its cross section ) and focused ion beams , that are studied in sections 3 and 4 , respectively ( honrubia et al .",

    "on the other hand , because the fuel is stagnated at the time of maximum compression , we assume that the dt is initially at rest with an uniform temperature of 100 ev .",

    "we refer to this distribution as `` quasi - monoenergetic '' throughout the paper .",

    "for a 100 nm thick dlc ( diamond like carbon ) foil illuminated by a peak laser irradiance of @xmath28 w/@xmath12 , yin et al . obtained an enhanced acceleration time of 400 fs , still negligible when compared with the time of flight spread shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "this distance has been chosen in order to have a peak power about 1.5 pw and a pulse duration on target of @xmath22 3 ps ( fwhm ) .",
    "note that the small time spread of quasi - monoenergetic ions allows to place the source at much higher distances than maxwellian ions .",
    "because beam focalization over such distances may be difficult , a number of techniques have been proposed for that .",
    "some of them are : i ) ballistic transport ( key 2007 , patel et al .",
    "2008 ) , ii ) focusing by fields self - generated in hollow microcylinders by intense sub - picosecond laser pulses ( toncian et al . , 2006 ) and iii ) focusing by magnetic lenses ( schollmeier et al .",
    "2008 , harres et al .",
    "2010 , hofmann et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "focusing of ions with maxwellian spectra has been studied over the last years .",
    "kar et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have demonstrated experimentally proton beam focusing by using foil rectangular or cylindrical hollow lens attached to a foil target .",
    "offermann et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have shown theoretically and experimentally that ion divergence depends on the thermal expansion of the co - moving hot electrons , resulting in a hyperbolic ion beam envelope . using these results , bartal et al .",
    "have shown experimentally an enhanced focusing of tnsa - protons in cone targets , inferring spot diameters about 20 @xmath2 m for ifi conditions , well under the 40 @xmath2 m spots required ( bartal et al .",
    "however , as it has been shown recently by implicit pic simulations ( qiao et al . 2013 ) , the cone wall focusing mechanism may reduce substantially the laser - to - proton conversion efficiency and , thus , the ion energy for the long pulses required in ifi .",
    "this can be mitigated by special designs of cone walls including insulator materials in order to reduce the electron flow between target and cone ( qiao et al .",
    "2013 ) .    for quasi - monoenergetic ions and , in particular , for those accelerated by the boa scheme , huang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have proposed recently the use of a second foil ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) to cool down the co - moving electrons and to absorb the trailing laser pulse that pass through the main foil after it becomes relativistically transparent ( huang et al .",
    "2011a and 2011b ) .",
    "the electron cooling obtained in this way reduces substantially both the beam divergence and the energy spread , and can be used together with the methods mentioned above for beam focusing in order to get the required spot size on target . in addition , heavier ions are less sensitive than protons to the co - moving electron expansion .",
    "range of monoenergetic ions in dt at 300 g/@xmath9 as a function of the plasma temperature . ]",
    "ranges of different ion species with typical energies for fi are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] as a function of the dt plasma temperature .",
    "we have used the standard stopping power formalism for classical plasmas ( trubnikov 1965 , honrubia 1993b ) which predicts range lengthening when plasma electron thermal velocities are comparable to fast ion velocity .",
    "the range lengthening effect is important for ions with maxwellian energy distributions placed far from the target .",
    "it balances the reduction over time of the ion energy incident on the fuel , keeping the ion range almost constant ( temporal et al . 2002 ) . on the contrary , as the ion energy on target is approximately constant for quasi - mononenergetic ions , range lengthening increases the volume heated by the beam and thus the ignition energies .",
    "fortunately , the importance of range lengthening is lower for heavier ions , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "for instance , protons increase their range by one order of magnitude when the dt temperature rises from 0.1 to 10 kev , while heavier ions such as aluminum or vanadium have an almost constant range for those temperatures .",
    "thus , a better coupling of heavier ion beams with the plasma should be expected ( honrubia et al .",
    "note that the range of the ions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] at 10 kev is about 2 g/@xmath12 , higher than the 1.2 g/@xmath12 requested for fi .",
    "however , as the ions deposit all their energy before such high temperatures are reached , the deposition range is substantially shorter in the cases analyzed here , as shown in section 3.1 .",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out again that because the heavier the ion , the higher the energy they carry for a given range , the number of ions required for ignition decreases with the atomic number .",
    "it is lower by orders of magnitude for vanadium ions than for protons .",

    "[ fig:4 ] .",
    "these energies have been chosen as those which minimize the ignition energies , as discussed in section 3.3 .",
    "energy deposition has been computed by assuming that ions propagate in a straight line and thus neglecting the angular scattering by plasma ions , that is important for low energy ions only . since the pulse duration is short enough compared to the resulting dt expansion ( with exception of the cylindrical beam edge , where a shock wave is launched into the cold plasma ) , the volume heated by the beam is determined mostly by the ion energy and the range lengthening effect .",
    "the three beams shown in fig .  [ fig:4 ] have a similar penetration into the dense core , almost up to its center .",
    "it corresponds to an areal density of around 1.6 g/@xmath12 , higher than atzeni s prescription of 1.2 g/@xmath12 ( atzeni 1999 , atzeni et al .",
    "2002 ) due to the deposition in the coronal plasma .",
    "lithium ions show a much less localized energy deposition than heavier ions , such as vanadium , due to their higher range lengthening .",
    "note also that the energy deposition in the coronal plasma decreases for heavier ions .",
    "thus , the coupling efficiency ( defined as the energy deposited in the plasma at densities higher than 200 g/@xmath9 ) should be higher for heavier ions .",
    "in particular , for the lithium , carbon and vanadium beams of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the coupling efficiencies are 0.74 , 0.81 and 0.89 , respectively , well over the coupling efficiencies found for ions with a maxwellian energy distribution ( honrubia et al . , 2009 ) .",

    "the ignition energies of all beams are quite close and have a similar variation with the beam diameter .",
    "the lowest ignition energy , 8.3 kj , is obtained for 450 mev carbon ions . in all cases ,",
    "the ignition energies rise for lower and higher beam diameters , showing almost a plateau for diameters between 20 and 40 @xmath2 m , which determines the focusing requirements for ifi . for beam diameters",
    "lower than 20 @xmath2 m , the energy density deposited is very high , leading to a strong plasma expansion and range lengthening with the subsequent increase of ion penetration .",
    "ions can even pass through the compressed fuel and escape off the rear surface .",
    "for beam diameters higher than 40 @xmath2 m , the ignition energies @xmath31 rise again due to the larger spot volume that has to be heated .",
    "however , the increase of the ignition energies is less than proportional to that volume due to the reduction of @xmath13-particle losses from large spots .",

    "the ignition energies for different beams as a function of the ion energy per nucleon are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "it is interesting to point out the remarkable result that all the ions have similar ignition energies , around 8.5 kj for the optimal kinetic energies @xmath14 .",
    "these optimal energies increase with the atomic number , being 140 mev for lithium , 450 mev for carbon , 2 gev for aluminum and 5.5 gev for vanadium ions , scaling , approximately , as @xmath0 .",
    "this scaling is important because it prescribes the optimal ion type as a function of the available ion - accelerating electric potential .",
    "the increase of the optimal ion kinetic energies with z was also reported by albright et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and fernndez et al .",
    "( 2008 ) within the context of ifi capsule designs for nif .",
    "the shape of the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] can be explained by taking into account that for low ion energies @xmath14 the pulse on target has a relatively low power , @xmath33 and a longer duration , @xmath34 ( honrubia et al .",
    "2009 ) . in this case",
    ", the pulse departs from the optimal one and the ignition energies @xmath31 increase . for high ion energies , @xmath31 increases again due to the higher fuel mass heated by the ion beam .",
    "as was mentioned in section 2.2 , the rise of the optimal ion energy with the atomic number of fast ions leads to a strong reduction of the number of ions required for ignition .",
    "for instance , around 10@xmath35 vanadium ions of 5.5gev are required to ignite the target shown in fig .",

    "basically , the scheme consists of using a set of beams generated far from the imploded core and focusing them into a spot placed in the density ramp surrounding the core .",
    "crossing beams generate a hollow cone energy deposition pattern .",
    "the scheme is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , where the ions are generated in a ring placed 5 mm far from the core with a mean diameter of 2.7 mm and a tilting angle of 15@xmath36 . in the reference case discussed below , we consider @xmath37 10 ion beams generated in spots placed symmetrically at the ring with a radius @xmath38 20.3 @xmath2 m and area @xmath39 each .",
    "we assume that n = 10 beams are sufficient to have an almost homogeneous ion ring on target , as shown by temporal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . to illustrate the new scheme and show the advantages of more tightly focused ion beams , laser beam parameters close to those used in recent boa experiments and simulations have been chosen .",

    "the evolution of the target shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] can be summarized as follows .",
    "the beams are focused into a spot placed in the density ramp such that the ions still have enough energy to penetrate further into the compressed fuel [ see figs .  [ fig:8](a ) and ( b ) ] .",
    "most of the energy deposition in the high density fuel takes place in a hollow cone .",
    "the dense fuel within the deposition zone expands and launches a strong shock wave that propagates towards the axis , where the shocks collide and compress the fuel further to very high densities ( @xmath22 1200 g/@xmath9 ) [ see fig .  [",

    "[ fig:8](d ) ] and increases its strength while propagating towards the right [ see figs .  [",
    "fig:8](e ) and ( f ) ] .",
    "ignition starts in this high - pressure region [ see figs .",
    "[ fig:8](g ) and ( h ) ] and propagates through the dense and cold fuel [ see figs .  [ fig:8](i ) and ( j ) ] . in this irradiation scheme",
    ", ignition is produced by the collision of two shocks on the axis , not by the direct heating of the fuel , being in this sense a variant of the shock ignition scheme ( betti 2006 ) .",
    "the main advantage of this irradiation scheme is that ignition can be achieved with substantially lower beam energies .",
    "for instance , a beam of 500 mev carbon ions focused onto a 10 @xmath2 m spot diameter at the depth of @xmath55 = 100 @xmath2 m on the axis requires 5.7 kj for ignition , which is approximately 2/3 of the energy required for a single beam , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that this improvement is not due to a sharper ion - beam focusing _ per se _ , as clearly shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] for a single beam .",
    "contrary to the single - beam case , the success of the array scheme depends on a sharper focusing of the ion beams able to generate strong converging shock waves . for instance , if the beams could be focused into a 5 @xmath2 m spot , the ignition energy would be reduced to 4.5 kj , roughly a half of that obtained for a single beam .",
    "the dependence of the ignition energy on the spot diameter is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] . for diameters",
    "as large as 15 @xmath2 m , the focusing beams scheme still reduces the ignition energy by @xmath2220% when compared with the single beam scheme . for larger diameters ,",
    "the differences between both schemes are not high enough to balance the difficulties of beam focusing .",
    "thus , its practical implementation is limited by the possibility of beam focusing into 10 @xmath2 m spots , smaller than those required for single beams ( 30 @xmath2 m ) , from distances of millimeters , which is a challenging task .",
    "the focused beams scheme presented above has some advantages when compared with that described in temporal et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and ( 2009 ) for proton fi . in this latter scheme ,",
    "the imploded target is first irradiated by a number of proton beamlets with an annular set up and a total energy of 1 kj followed , after a time delay , by a second cylindrical beam of 7 kj .",
    "the penetration of the central part of the cylindrical beam is blocked by the higher densities generated on the axis by the annular beamlets .",
    "meanwhile the outer part of the cylindrical beam penetrates further and generates a cylindrical shock that collides on the axis and ignites the dt fuel ahead the energy deposition of the central part of the ion beam . on the contrary , in our scheme",
    ", the shocks are produced directly by the whole beam energy deposition without any blocking effect and thus the scheme should be more effective .",
    "in addition , in the scheme of temporal et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , ignition is very sensitive to the time delay between the annular beams and the main cylindrical beam while in ours all beams are fired simultaneously .",
    "it is also worth noting that the focusing requirements are similar in both schemes because the diameter of each beamlet is 10 @xmath2 m , just the same than the spot required for our beams array .",
    "in order to extend the possibilities of ifi with quasi - monoenergetic ions , we consider different ion species and propose a new irradiation scheme with arrayed beams . specifically , fast ignition by quasi - monoenergetic lithium , carbon , aluminum and vanadium ions have been analyzed for a simplified dt fuel configuration with a peak density of 500 g/@xmath9 .",
    "using middle or heavy ion beams has the advantage of reducing substantially , by orders of magnitude , the number of ions required for ignition .",
    "ideal ion beams with a uniform flux within its cross section and an energy spread of 10@xmath56 perfectly focused into such a configuration have been analyzed .",
    "simulations show that the minimum ignition energies , about 8.5 kj , are similar for the ions studied here despite being obtained with very different kinetic energies .",
    "we should point out that those ignition energies have to be considered as a lower limit due to the strong assumptions made .",
    "anyhow , taking into account laser - to - ion conversion efficiencies around 10% or higher found so far ( hegelich et al . 2011 ) , it would be possible to fast ignite a pre - compressed target with laser energies of about 100 kj .",
    "it is worth mentioning the high laser - to - proton conversion efficiencies ( 15% ) measured recently in target normal sheath acceleration experiments ( brenner et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "in addition to the collimated beam studies , we propose a new target irradiation scheme based on an array of focused quasi - monoenergetic ion beams . as a single 100kj short - pulse laser can not easily envisaged , the single beam scheme would be based on the combination / superposition of multiple beamlets to get the required energy , in a similar way that the ion beam array proposed here .",
    "the difference is that in our scheme the beamlets should be focused onto a spot sited on the target density ramp . that may be a better way of deploying individual fi laser beams ( or individual clusters of laser beams ) .",
    "our results show that the arrayed beam scheme reduces substantially the ignition energies obtained for single beams , provided that the ion beams can be adequately focused into 10 @xmath2 m spots .",
    "of course , to achieve such focusing will require a substantial reduction of the transverse temperature of co - moving electrons , for instance , by using a second cooling foil ( huang et al .",
    "2011 ) , which shall be used together with one of the focusing techniques outlined in section 2.1 .",
    "the price to be paid for the reduction of the ignition energy would be the 3d focusing of the beam array , which may have a similar or even higher difficulty than using lasers with energies above 100kj .",

    "<S> fast ignition of inertial fusion targets driven by quasi - monoenergetic ion beams is investigated by means of numerical simulations . </S>",
    "<S> light and intermediate ions such as lithium , carbon , aluminum and vanadium have been considered . </S>",
    "<S> simulations show that the minimum ignition energies of an ideal configuration of compressed deuterium - tritium are almost independent on the ion atomic number . </S>",
    "<S> however , they are obtained for increasing ion energies , which scale , approximately , as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the ion atomic number . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the ion beam can be focused into 10 @xmath2 m spots , a new irradiation scheme is proposed to reduce the ignition energies . the combination of intermediate z ions , such as 5.5 gev vanadium , and the new irradiation scheme allows a reduction of the number of ions required for ignition by , roughly , three orders of magnitude when compared with the standard proton fast ignition scheme . </S>"
