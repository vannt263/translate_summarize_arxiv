    "measurements of electronic specific heat have played an important role in clarifying the nature of superconducting pairing symmetry@xcite , normal state pseudogap@xcite , quantum criticality@xcite , and many other fundamental properties of high-@xmath5 superconductors@xcite .",
    "while the mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity is not understood , there is an emerging consensus that the superconducting state itself is not particularly exotic , in the sense that it consists of a bcs - like pair state with well - defined quasiparticle excitations .",
    "specific heat experiments are insensitive to the phase of the order parameter , but can provide bulk information on the behavior of low energy density of states . it has been confirmed that at very low temperatures below @xmath5 the zero field specific heat varies as @xmath6 and the field dependent specific heat scales as @xmath1,@xcite consistent with the d - wave pairing scenario of high-@xmath5 superconductivity .",
    "revaz et.al @xcite also showed that the field dependent term obeys a scaling function of @xmath7 proposed by volovik @xcite .",
    "the loss of the entropy deduced from the specific heat data well above @xmath5 in underdoped cuprates has revealed much important information on the normal state pseudogap@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we report our experimental data of the electronic specific heat of @xmath8 measured from @xmath9 to room temperatures in an external magnetic field up to @xmath10 .",
    "we choose calcium doped @xmath11 ( ybco ) samples because the substitution of @xmath12 by @xmath13 adds holes to the material .",
    "this allows physical properties of ybco - type cuprates to be investigated in both over- and under - doped regimes .",
    "the data reported in this paper were taken on polycrystalline @xmath8 samples of about 1 g in weight each , prepared by conventional solid state reaction .",
    "the oxygen content was controlled by the annealing temperature and determined from the weight loss after annealing , with an uncertainty  0.01 in x. we measured the specific heat using a differential technique in which the difference in specific heat between the sample under investigation and a related reference sample is measured with a resolution of about @xmath14 ( i.e. @xmath15 of the electronic contribution)@xcite .",
    "the majority of the phonon contribution is backed off by the reference sample and a simple and reliable correction for residual differences in phonon terms allows us to separate accurately the electronic specific heat @xmath16 from the total @xcite . in this paper",
    "we are mostly concerned with the change of the specific heat between a finite field and a zero field determined in separate runs .",
    "whilst this quantity is independent of the phonon specific heat , the inherent reproducibility of the differential technique coupled with the elimination of the bulk of the phonon term greatly increases the reliability with which small field dependent changes can be determined .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , our experimental results are presented and discussed . emphasis is given to the scaling behavior of the specific heat in a finite field and the temperature dependence of the upper critical field .",
    "[ sec3 ] gives a brief summary .",
    "we have measured seven @xmath17 ca substituted ybco samples . zero field measurements on this system",
    "have been discussed previously @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows the critical transition temperature @xmath5 for all the samples .",
    "the optimal doping is located at @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the condensation energy at zero temperature @xmath20 , rescaled by @xmath21 , is also shown in this figure .",
    "the value of @xmath20 , as will be discussed later , is determined from the difference of the free energy density between the normal and superconducting states .",
    "@xmath22 is nearly doping independent when @xmath23 but drops rapidly with decreasing @xmath24 when @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath22 at the optimal doping @xmath18 @xmath26 is about half of the value at @xmath4 @xmath27 .",
    "this rapid decrease in @xmath20 is due to the opening of the normal state pseudogap at a planar hole density @xmath28@xcite .",
    "the abrupt change in the doping dependence of the condensation energy around @xmath4 might be a manifestation of quantum critical phenomena .",
    "similar changes have also been found in the doping dependence of the superfluid stiffness@xcite as well as many other physical quantities @xcite .",
    "the specific heat is an important quantity in characterizing low - energy excitations ( see for example ref .",
    "it provides a direct measure of thermal excitations ( spectral weight ) in the electronic spectrum . in a fermi liquid system ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient , @xmath29 at low temperatures reflects the energy dependence of the density of states of low - lying excitations .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the change of the specific heat coefficient @xmath30 in four fields @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath10 for @xmath34 .",
    "since no corrections from the lattice contribution to the raw data of @xmath35 are involved , there is no ambiguity in this quantity . in the normal state ( @xmath36 )",
    ", @xmath37 is unchanged by the applied fields within an experimental uncertainty of @xmath38 . at zero field ( see the inset of fig.[fig2 ] , @xmath39 shows a sharp peak around @xmath5 .",
    "this peak is gradually suppressed by increasing field .    in type - ii superconductors in an applied magnetic field , there are two types of low - lying excitations : vortex core bound states and extended quasiparticle states which evolve smoothly into the bulk zero - field quasiparticle states at large distances from the vortex @xcite . in a conventional @xmath40-wave superconductor , the low energy density of states is dominated by the core bound states , since the extended states are fully gapped and the core level spacing is about a factor @xmath41 smaller than the quasiparticle excitation gap , where @xmath42 is the energy gap and @xmath43 is the fermi energy . since the number of vortices scales linearly with @xmath2 , the low energy density of states is also proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "this means that at low temperatures and when @xmath44 , the specific heat scales linearly with @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 .    however , in the mixed state of a superconductor with line nodes , volovik@xcite pointed out that the low energy density of states is dominated by contributions from extended quasiparticle states rather than the core bound states .",
    "it was shown that the core bound states contribute less to the entropy than the extended quasiparticles by a factor that diverges logarithmically with the inter - vortex separation .",
    "this is due to the effect of doppler shift caused by supercurrents circulating around a vortex .",
    "since the inter - vortex distance is proportional to @xmath47 and the number of vortices is proportional to @xmath2 , it follows that the density of states at the fermi level is proportional to @xmath1 and the specific heat varies as @xmath48 in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , from the @xmath1  scaling behavior of the excitation spectrum , simon and lee @xcite showed that low temperature thermal and transport coefficients of a d - wave superconductor should scale with @xmath50 .",
    "in particular , they predicted that the specific heat has a simple scaling form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a undetermined scaling function .",
    "this scaling prediction holds for clean d - wave superconductors and for energy scales small compared to the maximum gap scale . in the dirty limit , kubert and hirschfeld @xcite showed that the low - lying excitations are still dominated by the extended states , but the specific heat behaves as @xmath53 at low fields .",
    "the @xmath54 term of the specific heat was first identified by moler et al @xcite for ybco single crystals and later by other groups @xcite .",
    "the @xmath50 scaling behavior has also been reported in the specific heat measurements of ybco@xcite .    for ca doped ybco",
    ", we find that the field dependent @xmath55 varies linearly with temperature at low temperatures ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) and can be fitted by the equation @xmath56 within experimental errors .",
    "the first term is just the coefficient of the initial linear @xmath57 term of @xmath16 and is predicted to vary as @xmath1 in an ideal @xmath58-wave superconductor . for overdoped @xmath8 ( the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) , we indeed find that @xmath59 , with slopes comparable with that found for optimally doped single crystal ybco @xcite and the theoretical predication@xcite .",
    "however , for underdoped @xmath8 ( the lower panel of fig . [ fig4 ] ) , we find that @xmath60 varies linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "this is different from the @xmath1 scaling behavior of a clean d - wave superconductor and also from the @xmath53 scaling behavior predicted for a dirty d - wave superconductor .",
    "we do not know if this violation of the @xmath1 scaling law of @xmath16 in these underdoped samples is due to the effect of normal state pseudogap or just because the temperatures we have measured are not low enough to probe the characteristic low - energy feature of a @xmath58-wave superconductor .",
    "further investigation on the field dependence of the specific heat of underdoped high-@xmath5 materials at low temperatures is desired .",
    "the field dependence of @xmath61 is more complicated and less accurately determined than @xmath62 .",
    "however , for the @xmath4 sample , we find that @xmath61 varies almost linearly with @xmath2 ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "this linear @xmath2 dependence of @xmath61 is not what one may expect from the scaling relation ( [ scale ] ) .",
    "the electronic entropy @xmath63 is one of the parameters sensitive to both superconducting condensation and normal states pseudo - gap and can be determined from the temperature integration of thespecific heat coefficient @xmath64    our data of @xmath63 for @xmath17 ca doped ybco at zero field are shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy ] .",
    "there is an abrupt change in the slope of @xmath63 at @xmath5 due to the specific heat jump .",
    "for the overdoped samples ( x=0.93 , 0.87 and 0.79 ) , the normal state entropy extrapolates to zero at zero temperature . however , for the optimal and underdoped samples ( x= 0.7 , 0.64 , 0.56 and 0.48 ) the normal state entropy extrapolates to a negative value at zero temperature .",
    "this means that some of the entropy is lost in the normal state in these materials .",
    "this loss of entropy has been attributed to the opening of the normal state pseudogap .",
    "similar results have been observed in other cuprate systems.@xcite    fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the enhancement of the entropy at a @xmath10 magnetic field for different oxygen contents .",
    "the superconducting condensation is suppressed by an external field below @xmath5 .",
    "this causes the increase of the entropy . in the normal state ,",
    "the entropy is almost unchanged by the external field .",
    "this suggests that the normal state pseudogap is unaffected by an external field , consistent with the nmr data for underdoped ybco@xcite .      from the entropy ,",
    "one can further find out the free energy density .",
    "in particular , by integrating out the entropy difference between the normal and superconducting states at zero field , the change of the free energy @xmath65 can be obtained , where @xmath66 is the thermodynamic field . at zero temperature @xmath67",
    "is the condensation energy @xmath20 .",
    "our results of @xmath68 are shown in fig . [",
    "fig7](a ) for different oxygen contents .",
    "the behavior of this quantity is different for overdoped and underdoped samples . with decreasing temperatures , @xmath68 increases more rapidly in the overdoped samples than in the underdoped ones .",
    "the change of the free energy density in a field in the superconducting state @xmath69 can be similarly obtained .",
    "[ fig7](b ) shows @xmath70 for the @xmath4 sample .",
    "the largest @xmath71 at @xmath10 and @xmath72 is about @xmath73 , much smaller than @xmath74 .",
    "this indicates that the upper critical field @xmath3 at zero temperature is much larger than our maximum field of 13 t .      in recent years",
    ", there has been intensive investigation on the temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath3 in high-@xmath5 superconductors .",
    "mackenzie et al.@xcite measured the field dependence of the in - plane resistivity of overdoped @xmath75 and found that @xmath76 shows a positive curvature at low temperatures .",
    "similar temperature dependence of @xmath3 has also been found in the transport measurements of other overdoped materials @xcite . to understand this puzzling upward curvature of @xmath76 ,",
    "a number of theories have been proposed@xcite , invoking thermal and quantal fluctuations .",
    "wen et al measured temperature dependence of the magnetic moment of overdoped @xmath77 and @xmath78 and found that there are two transitions in the m(t ) curve in an applied field@xcite .",
    "the field dependence of the lower transition ( or crossover ) temperature indeed exhibits an upturn at low temperatures , similar to the upper critical field found in the transport measurements .",
    "however , the field dependence of the upper transition temperature behaves very differently .",
    "it shows a negative curvature , same as for the upper critical field in conventional superconductors .",
    "they argued that the transition at higher temperature corresponds to the true upper critical field @xmath3 and the upward curvature of the critical field at lower temperature is in fact due to the formation of a bulk superconducting phase coherence through josephson coupling between some superconducting clusters with a transition temperature higher than the bulk transition temperature@xcite .",
    "we can estimate the upper critical field @xmath3 from the free energy data obtained above if we assume that the magnetisation obeys the london expression ( see for example ref @xcite ) . in the mixed state",
    ", the difference of the free energy @xmath71 in the superconducting state can be deduced from the reversible magnetization m : @xmath79 the london formula of the magnetization in the mixed states is approximately given by@xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the ginsberg - laudau parameter , @xmath82 is the penetration depth , and @xmath83 is a constant .",
    "the lower and upper critical fields @xmath84 and @xmath3 are related to the thermodynamic field by the formula @xmath85 . substituting ( [ mag ] ) into ( [ free ] ) and carrying out the integration , we find that @xmath86 .",

    "[ fig8 ] shows @xmath87 as a function of @xmath2 at different temperatures for the @xmath4 sample .",
    "the the dash and dot lines are the fits of @xmath71 using eq.([hc2 ] ) with the value of @xmath88 shown in fig.[fig7 ] .",
    "the values of @xmath3 for this material can be obtained from the fits and the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] for the @xmath4 sample ( similar results have been obtained for other samples ) . same as for conventional @xmath40-wave superconductors , we find that @xmath89 has a negative curvature .",
    "close to @xmath5 , @xmath3 varies linearly with temperature and @xmath90 .",
    "this agrees with the electronic specific heat measurement for overdoped @xmath75 @xcite , where @xmath3 is determined by the changes of @xmath5 in magnetic fields . the magnitude of @xmath3 is much larger than that determined from the transport measurement , in agreement with the magnetization measurement data of wen et al@xcite for overdoped @xmath91 and @xmath92 , but in disagreement with the transport measurement data for overdoped@xmath75 @xcite and @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the difference between the thermodynamic and transport measurements has been attributed by wen et al to a macroscopic phase separation of electrons in overdoped materials .",
    "another alternative is that transport measurements are sensitive to flux - flow resistance at temperatures much lower than the thermodynamic critical temperature .",
    "in summary , we have measured the electronic specific heat of @xmath8 using a differential technique from @xmath94 to room temperature in a magnetic field up to 13 t .",
    "we have discussed the physical properties of the specific heat , the entropy , the free energy density and the upper critical field . for optimal and overdoped samples",
    ", we found that the field dependent specific heat coefficient scales with @xmath1 at low temperatures , in agreement with other experimental measurements .",
    "however , for underdoped samples , we found that the low temperature specific heat coefficient scales linearly with @xmath2 , inconsistent with the @xmath1 scaling law as expected for clean @xmath58-wave superconductors .",
    "further investigation on the field dependence of low temperature specific heat in clean underdoped high-@xmath5 superconductors should be carried out to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "the upper critical field for the overdoped sample ( @xmath4 ) shows a downward curvature .",
    "this agrees with the results of the magnetization measurements but differs from those of the transport measurements .",
    "it suggests that the overdoped materials might be very inhomogeneous in an external field and the upward curvature of @xmath3 observed in the resistivity measurement is probably due to the josephson coupling between the superconducting clusters produced by electronic phase separation .",
