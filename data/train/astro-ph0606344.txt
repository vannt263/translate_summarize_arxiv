    "the study of global galaxy properties has been recently invigorated by modern sensitive large - area surveys across a wide wavelength range . the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , york et al .",
    "2000 , for more details see appendix a1 ) stands out because it has already provided near - uv to near - ir five - color imaging data and high - quality spectra ( r@xmath21800 ) for over 500,000 galaxies .",
    "the `` main '' spectroscopic galaxy sample is defined by a simple r - band flux limit ( strauss et al . 2002 ) , and will include close to 1,000,000 galaxies .    a number of detailed galaxy studies based on sdss data have already been published .",

    "( 2003 ) presented the sdss galaxy luminosity function , and kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003ab ) determined and analyzed stellar masses and star - formation histories for 100,000 sdss galaxies .",
    "in addition to `` stand - alone '' studies based on only sdss data , sdss can be used as a cornerstone for panchromatic studies of galaxies aided by recent surveys at wavelengths outside the optical range ( 0.3 - 1 ) .",
    "the special role of sdss in such studies is due to its rich optical information , in particular high - quality spectra and photometry .",
    "nevertheless , galaxies emit a substantial fraction of their bolometric flux outside the wavelength range accessible to sdss . for example , in starburst and seyfert 2 galaxies the mid / far - ir wavelength range is the most important contributor to the bolometric flux , e.g. schmitt et al .",
    "information obtained by other surveys offers important observational constraints for models of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "numerous studies that utilize sdss and surveys at other wavelengths have already been published .",

    "a detailed analysis of rest - frame colors in the strmgren system synthesized from sdss spectra was presented by smoli et al .",

    "references and a description of each survey are listed in appendix a. the panchromatic galaxy samples discussed here are @xmath210 - 100 times larger than those used in older pre - sdss studies . in addition , they are selected by simple flux limits , and benefit from a wealth of accurately measured parameters including x - ray to radio photometry , angular sizes , and optical spectra .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to quantify the fraction and basic properties of sdss `` main '' galaxies detected by other surveys using a uniform approach for all analyzed surveys .",

    "[ agnvssf ] . in general , for any combination of optical and near - ir bands , star - forming galaxies are bluer than agns .",
    "for example , the @xmath19 and @xmath20 mean colors differ by 0.2 and 0.1 mag , respectively .",
    "according to the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks hereafter ) , these differences are highly statistically significant , as is easily discernible from the two middle panels .",

    "[ sed ] which compares the optical - to - far - ir seds , normalized to the sdss @xmath24-band , for star - forming and agn galaxies selected from a narrow redshift range . since the @xmath24-band flux is a good measure of the 0.2 - 2.2 @xmath25 bolometric luminosity , this implies that star - forming galaxies emit more ir radiation as a fraction of their 0.22.2 @xmath25 bolometric output , than do agn galaxies .",
    "this difference could be partially caused by a selection effect ; since the apparent @xmath24-band magnitudes of star - forming galaxies tend to be somewhat fainter that those of agn galaxies due to differences in luminosity functions and sampled redshift range , they will be detected by iras with the same probability only if they have somewhat redder @xmath21 colors . however",
    ", this effect does not seem to be quantitatively sufficient to explain the observed difference in median @xmath21 colors .",
    "there are several plausible explanations for the different median @xmath21 colors for agn and star - forming galaxies : star - forming galaxies could have warmer dust , significantly more dust , or more uv radiation that is absorbed by dust and re - emitted in the far - ir than agn galaxies ( of course , these possibilities are not mutually exclusive ) .",
    "different dust temperatures is probably ruled out two types have very similar @xmath26 color distributions ; this color is much more sensitive to dust temperature than to the amount of dust ; for a detailed discussion see e.g. , ivezi & elitzur 1997 ) , as shown in the bottom right panel in fig .",
    "[ agnvssf ] . in order to test the hypothesis that the difference is caused by a different amount of dust ,",
    "we compared the distributions of extinction estimates , @xmath27 , discussed in section  [ saz ] .",
    "as discernible from the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ az ] , star - forming galaxies detected by iras typically have _ smaller _",
    "@xmath27 than agn galaxies , thus ruling out this hypothesis .",
    "thus , it appears that star - forming galaxies emit more far - ir radiation ( as a fraction of bolometric flux in the 0.22.2 @xmath25 wavelength range ) than agn galaxies , despite having smaller @xmath27 of dust at similar temperatures , because they have significantly more uv radiation ( again , as a fraction of bolometric flux in the 0.22.2 @xmath25 wavelength range ) that is processed into far - ir wavelength range .",
    "this conclusion is supported by galex data discussed by ageros et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , who find a correlation between @xmath13 and contribution of the uv flux to the bolometric flux . since star - forming galaxies tend to have bluer @xmath13 colors than agns ( see section  [ uvsfagn ] )",
    ", this implies that their uv flux contributes more to the bolometric flux than for agn galaxies .",
    "indeed , once a larger sdss - galex - iras sample is available , the expected strong correlation between @xmath28 and @xmath27 ( similar to , and perhaps stronger than , the correlation shown in fig  [ iraspred ] ) can be directly tested .    in a recent paper based on similar data , pasquali , kauffmann & heckman ( 2005 , hereafter pkh ) found that the `` agn exhibit a significant excess in far - ir emission relative to star - forming galaxies '' , which apparently contradicts the results presented here .",
    "however , it should be pointed out that here we discuss the amount of ir radiation ( at 60 @xmath25 ) as a fraction of bolometric output in the 0.22.2 @xmath25 range ( i.e. , @xmath21 color ) , while pkh discuss the ir luminosity _ per unit stellar mass_. furthermore , their statement is valid for carefully selected pairs of agn and star - forming galaxies that have similar physical characteristics such as stellar mass , color , size , etc .",
    "( it is also noteworthy that the distributions of stellar mass and stellar mass - to - light ratio are very different for agn and star - forming galaxies , as shown by kauffmann et al .",

    "this correlation was interpreted by helou et al .",
    "( 1985 ) as a consequence of coupling between infrared thermal dust emission and radio non - thermal synchrotron emission , and it is not known whether the details of this coupling are the same for star - forming and agn galaxies ( e.g. , see bell 2003 ) .",
    "in addition , both far - ir and radio emission are used as probes for ongoing and recent star formation ( hopkins et al .",

    "the strong correlation between the two fluxes is evident . only about 1% of sources have anomalously bright radio emission ( by about @xmath22 mag ) , a fraction that is consistent with contamination by random associations ( the same fractions of agn and star - forming galaxies are found among those 1% of sources , as in the whole sample",
    "; they are all bright point sources at 20 cm ) , but could also be due to radio - loud objects . in order to avoid the effect of faint flux limits on the distribution of the far - ir - to - radio flux ratio ( i.e. , the @xmath29 color ) , we restrict the sample to 568 galaxies with @xmath30 ( a condition perpendicular to the @xmath31 lines in the @xmath32 vs. @xmath33 plane , see the dashed line in the left panel in fig .

    "such a narrow width is quite remarkable given so different wavelengths and survey technologies , and represents a strong constraint for the theories of coupled radiation mechanisms ( e.g. , helou et al .",
    "it also places an upper limit of 0.4 mag on the iras photometric error for galaxies .    a very similar analysis of ir - radio correlation based on a smaller sample ( 176 ugc galaxies )",
    "was presented by condon & broderick ( 1988 ) , who used a slightly different parameter @xmath34 ( sometimes also called the @xmath35 parameter , e.g. , bell 2003 ) .",
    "they find a peaked distribution similar to that shown in fig .",

    "condon & broderick proposed that galaxies in this peak ( @xmath37 ) are dominated by starbursts , while agns ( `` monsters '' in their terminology ) have too weak ir emission to be detected by iras , implying @xmath38 .",
    "the high - quality sdss spectra and corresponding bpt - diagram based separation of emission - line galaxies into agn and star - forming galaxies allows us to examine ir - radio correlation in detail .",
    "we find that over 1/3 of sdss - nvss - iras galaxies with emission lines can be reliably classified as an agn based on their position in the bpt diagram , with an additional 50% in the transition region ( `` unknown '' sources , using classification described in section  [ sbpt ] ) .",

    "two subsamples with 128 agn and 46 star - forming galaxies yield median @xmath29 values of @xmath41 and @xmath42 , and widths of 0.61 and 0.38 mag , respectively color measurement should not be interpreted as implying a power - law spectral energy distribution between 60 @xmath6 m and 20 cm with the power - law index of @xmath20.6 ( @xmath43 ) . for example",

    "the difference between the medians is @xmath47 significant , and suggests that the details of radiation coupling mechanisms may be different for star - forming and agn galaxies ( i.e. , among galaxies that follow ir - radio correlation , star - forming galaxies appear to show @xmath220% more radio emission , relative to far - ir , than agn galaxies ) .",
    "we note that this result should be considered somewhat tentative because there may be systematic effects that are not included when estimating uncertainties in the medians color and the radio spectral slope between 20 cm and 92 cm . ] , and thus its significance could be overestimated .",
    "it is also noteworthy that none of star - forming galaxies have @xmath39 , while this is true for 4% of agns ( that is , an opposite trend than for medians ) .",
    "we searched for possible correlations between @xmath29 and other observables that could perhaps explain the different median values of this color for agn and star - forming subsamples ( either as selection effects , bad data , bad analysis method , or astrophysics ) .",
    "we analyzed quantities such as colors , redshift , stellar mass , luminosity , angular size , dust extinction estimate @xmath27 , etc .",
    ", and the only quantity that appears to have an effect on @xmath29 is the @xmath8 ratio , as shown in fig .",

    "star - forming galaxies are confined to the @xmath48 region , while agn galaxies span the whole observed range of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , as the @xmath8 line strength ratio increases , the strength of ir emission for agn galaxies , relative to radio emission , also increases ( i.e. , the @xmath29 color becomes bluer ) .",
    "since the measurement of @xmath29 is fully independent of the @xmath8 measurement , this behavior provides additional support for the 3@xmath49 significant difference in the slopes of ir - radio correlation for star - forming and agn galaxies ( note , however , that the agn presence could have an effect on the measured @xmath8 ratio ) .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is no evidence for a similar behavior in the @xmath29 vs @xmath27 diagram , although some degree of correlation exists between @xmath8 and @xmath27 .",
    "this may mean that the effects of gas and dust on infrared and radio emission are more complex than implied by a simple linear ir - radio correlation ( for a detailed discussion of this possibility see bell 2003 ) .",
    "given that both agn and star - forming subsamples of sdss - nvss - iras galaxies follow very similar , if not identical , radio - ir correlation , it is interesting to investigate what fraction of the full sdss - nvss and sdss - iras subsamples could follow this correlation ( that is , galaxies that are detected by only two , instead of all three , surveys ) .",
    "we perform this analysis by using the observed radio - ir correlation to predict @xmath32 for sdss - iras galaxies , or @xmath33 for sdss - nvss galaxies . in the second step we select galaxies with predicted fluxes 1 mag brighter than the faint limit of the corresponding third catalog ( to account for the scatter due to photometric errors ) , and",
    "then determine what fraction of these galaxies are actually detected .",
    "for example , if _ every _ iras galaxy follows ir - radio correlation , then we estimate that @xmath50 of sdss - iras galaxies with predicted @xmath51 should be detected by nvss .",

    "the converse is not true .",
    "only about 1/3 of sdss - nvss _ emission - line _ galaxies with @xmath53 are detected by iras .",
    "this is consistent with a hypothesis that there is another source of radio emission , in addition to the component that is correlated with ir emission .",
    "the elevated radio emission is then responsible for the nvss detection , but ir emission is too weak for an iras detection .",
    "presumably , those agns that are detected by both nvss and iras are mostly radio - quiet , while those with elevated radio emission are mostly radio - loud .",
    "not surprisingly , sdss - nvss emission - line galaxies without iras detection have typically redder @xmath7 colors than those detected by both nvss and iras ( the difference in medians is 0.6 mag ) .",

    "the other three panels are analogous to the top left panel , except that they show the dependence of residuals on the 4000   break ( @xmath55 ) , the strength of @xmath56 line , and stellar mass . ]",
    "the strongest correlation between the @xmath5-band sdss-2mass residuals and another quantity is found for @xmath27 , the galaxy dust content discussed in detail in section  [ saz ] .",
    "the top panel in fig .",
    "[ kpred3 ] illustrates this correlation .",
    "a best straight line fit is given by @xmath57 this correlation may be interpreted as the effect of dust on the observed @xmath4-band flux ( however , note that the simple extinction screen approximation is probably not appropriate ) .",
    "when this correlation is subtracted from @xmath58 given by the eq .",
    "[ kpredeq ] , the width of the residuals distribution decreases by a factor of 2 , to 0.1 mag ! in other words , given the @xmath7 color , redshift , and @xmath27 determined using sdss data , the 2mass @xmath5-band measurements can be predicted with a scatter of only 0.1 mag .",
    "most of this scatter can be attributed to the measurement errors .",
    "for example , assuming conservative lower limits for errors in @xmath7 ( 0.03 mag ) , @xmath5 ( 0.03 mag , jarrett et al .",
    "2000 ) , and @xmath59 ( 2% ) , the expected scatter due to measurement errors is 0.09 mag .",
    "hence , the observed residual scatter of 0.1 mag is likely dominated by measurement errors .",
    "we note that the final distribution of the @xmath60 residuals shown in the bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ kpred2 ] is skewed .",
    "this could be due to the fact that the dependence of the @xmath60 residuals on @xmath27 was fit by a straight line , while the data display some curvature .",
    "also , it could be that there are two subpopulations of galaxies that have slightly different seds .    since the residual astrophysical scatter is apparently much smaller than 0.1 mag , one",
    "is tempted to conclude that 2mass measurements are not required to study sdss galaxies .",
    "this would not be a valid conclusion for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the measurement error for 2mass @xmath5 band magnitudes is @xmath20.03 mag , which is smaller than the residual scatter for predicted @xmath5 band magnitudes ( 0.1 mag ) .",
    "second , we have not investigated morphological properties of galaxies in the near - ir , where smaller dust extinction could reveal features not visible in the optical wavelength range .",
    "we have also studied the correlation between the @xmath5-band sdss-2mass residuals and the 4000   break ( @xmath55 ) , the strength of @xmath56 line , and stellar mass ( fig .",
    "[ kpred3 ] ) .",
    "none of the correlations is as strong as the correlation with @xmath27 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ kpred3 ] , the overall behavior of agn and star - forming subsamples are similar to each other , though not identical .          motivated by the surprisingly small residual scatter in the k band flux prediction ( 0.1 mag ) , we have investigated the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 2003 ) model predictions for the distribution of optical and near - ir galaxy colors .",
    "the top left panel in fig .",
    "[ kpred4 ] shows that for a given galaxy type , the @xmath60 color is a function of redshift , and at a given redshift the @xmath60 color is a function of galaxy type .",
    "this behavior is in agreement with observations , although model galaxies have the @xmath7 colors too blue by several tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the models are also in agreement with a @xmath20 vs. redshift relation that is independent of galaxy type , as discussed in section  [ kpredict ] ( see top right panel ) .",
    "the behavior of simple stellar populations ( as opposed to synthetic galaxies ) in the same diagrams suggests that both the @xmath60 and @xmath20 colors are sensitive to metallicity , with about 0.7 mag and 0.2 mag redward shifts in the @xmath60 and @xmath20 colors as the metallicity increases by a factor of 10 .",
    "the observed small residual scatter in the k band flux prediction thus implies that the galaxy metallicity distribution is fairly narrow : about 0.2 dex around the median value .",
    "this is in agreement with tremonti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) who found a very tight mass - metallicity relation ( 0.1 dex metallicity scatter at a given mass ) .",
    "this study indicates the enormous potential of modern massive sensitive large  scale surveys , and emphasizes the added value obtained by combining data from different wavelengths .",
    "while qualitatively our study is in agreement with previous work ( e.g. , galaxies detected by iras tend to be blue ) , the sample size and the wealth of measured parameters allowed us to obtain some qualitatively and quantitatively new results .",
    "galaxy seds form a nearly one - dimensional sequence in the optical - to - near - ir range .",
    "for example , the sdss @xmath3 and @xmath4-band data , supplemented with redshift and dust content estimate , can be used to predict @xmath5-band magnitudes measured by 2mass with an rms scatter of only 0.1 mag and the intrinsic astrophysical scatter probably significantly smaller . within the restricted wavelength range probed by sdss ,",
    "this scatter is even smaller .",
    "smoli et al .",
    "( 2006 ) show that the rest - frame @xmath61 color ( 55008500   wavelength range ) can be predicted with an rms of only 0.05 mag using strmgren colors evaluated in the 40005800   wavelength range .",
    "smoli et al .",
    "( 2006 ) also find a strong correlation between strmgren colors and the position of a galaxy in the bpt diagram , a result that is confirmed here using the @xmath7 color . as shown by smoli et al .",
    ", other parameters , such as those determined by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , can also be used to parametrize the position of a galaxy on this one - dimensional sequence in the multi - dimensional color space . or equivalently , using the terminology from yip et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , most of the variance in galaxy seds is already absorbed in the first few principal components .",
    "we integrate the broad - band uv - to - near - ir seds of dominant galaxy types and find that the @xmath24-band flux is the closest , color - independent , proxy for bolometric flux measurement in the 0.22.2 @xmath25 range for galaxies with redshifts smaller than @xmath20.2 .",
    "we find that galaxies detected by galex include a non - negligible fraction ( 10 - 30% ) of agns , and hence do not represent a clean sample of starburst galaxies .",
    "this conclusion is supported by their @xmath7 color distribution , position in the bpt diagram , and morphological appearance ( see ageros et al .",
    "2005 for more details ) .",
    "we demonstrate that interstellar dust content inferred from optical spectra by kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003a ) is indeed higher for galaxies detected by iras confirming the reliability of the @xmath27 measurement .",
    "this represents a dramatic _ independent _ support for the notion that these model - based _ optical _ estimates of @xmath27 are related to the galaxy dust content .",
    "furthermore , @xmath27 can be used with the @xmath3-band measurements to predict iras 60 @xmath6 m flux within a factor of @xmath22 , which suggests that the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 , 2003 ) models used to derive @xmath27 provide fairly good description of the relevant physics . even more detailed and robust analysis along these lines",
    "will be possible with the advent of galex and spitzer data .",
    "we find that star - forming galaxies tend to be bluer than agn galaxies for all photometric bands bluewards from the @xmath5-band , while they have redder far - ir - to - optical colors .",
    "we conclude that star - forming galaxies have redder far - ir - to - optical colors than agn galaxies because they have more uv light that is processed to far - ir range , as a fraction of the 0.22.2 @xmath25 bolometric flux .",
    "we emphasize that a variety of different data for the _ same _ galaxy sample was required to reach this conclusion : galex , sdss , 2mass , and iras photometry , as well as the interstellar dust content inferred from sdss optical spectra with the aid of sophisticated models .",
    "a large sample of galaxies that have sdss spectra and are detected by iras and nvss allowed us to study the ir - radio correlation separately for star - forming and agn galaxies .",
    "we confirm that both galaxy types follow a tight correlation , and find that a large fraction ( 80% ) of optically classified sdss - nvss agn galaxies show significantly more radio emission than expected from their ir flux ( technically , we show that ir fluxes predicted from observed radio emission for galaxies that are not detected by iras are higher than the corresponding iras upper flux limits , see section  [ radioir ] ) .",
    "we also find marginal evidence for different slopes of ir - radio correlation for agn and star - forming subsamples , an effect that seems to be related to the @xmath8 line strength ratio .",
    "perhaps the most important conclusion of our study is that little more than a single datum can be learned about galaxies from photometric data whose accuracy is not demonstrably better than @xmath20.1 mag .",
    "fortunately , all three major modern galaxy surveys , galex , sdss , and 2mass , appear to have achieved this goal and , together with surveys such as first and nvss , opened unprecedented opportunities for detailed studies of galaxies .",

    "<S> we discuss the panchromatic properties of 99,088 galaxies selected from the sloan digital sky survey data release 1 `` main '' spectroscopic sample ( a flux - limited sample for 1360 deg@xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these galaxies are positionally matched to sources detected by rosat , galex , 2mass , iras , gb6 , first , nvss and wenss . </S>",
    "<S> the matching fraction varies from @xmath1% for rosat and gb6 to @xmath240% for galex and 2mass . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to its size , the advantages of this sample are well controlled selection effects , faint flux limits and the wealth of measured parameters , including accurate x - ray to radio photometry , angular sizes , and optical spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we find strong correlations between the detection fraction at other wavelengths and optical properties such as flux , colors , and emission - line strengths . </S>",
    "<S> for example , @xmath22/3 of sdss `` main '' galaxies classified as agn using emission - line strengths are detected by 2mass , while the corresponding fraction for star - forming galaxies is only @xmath21/10 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , over 90% of galaxies detected by iras display strong emission lines in their optical spectra , compared to @xmath250% for the whole sdss sample . using galex , sdss , and 2mass data , we construct the uv - ir broad - band spectral energy distributions for various types of galaxies , and find that they form a nearly one - parameter family . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the sdss @xmath3- and @xmath4- band data , supplemented with redshift , can be used to `` predict '' @xmath5-band magnitudes measured by 2mass with an rms scatter of only 0.2 mag . when a dust content estimate determined from sdss spectra with the aid of models </S>",
    "<S> is also utilized , this scatter decreases to 0.1 mag and can be fully accounted for by measurement uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this interstellar dust content , inferred from optical sdss spectra by kauffmann et al . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2003a ) , is indeed higher for galaxies detected by iras and that it can be used to `` predict '' measured iras 60 @xmath6 m flux density within a factor of two using only sdss data . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the position of a galaxy in the emission - line - based baldwin - phillips - terlevich diagram is correlated with the optical light concentration index and @xmath7 color determined from the sdss broad - band imaging data , and discuss changes in the morphology of this diagram induced by requiring detections at other wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> notably , we find that sdss `` main '' galaxies detected by galex include a non - negligible fraction ( 10 - 30% ) of agns , and hence do not represent a clean sample of starburst galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we study the ir - radio correlation and find evidence that its slope may be different for agn and star - forming galaxies and related to the @xmath8 line strength ratio .    </S>",
