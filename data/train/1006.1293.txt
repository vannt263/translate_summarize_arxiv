    "understanding the physical properties of baryonic matter above nuclear saturation density is one of the fundamental challenges in modern nuclear astrophysics .",
    "many aspects of neutron stars ( e.g. , the mass - radius relation , cooling and rotational dynamics , glitches and pulsar kicks ) depend on these properties .",
    "for example , the equation of state of supranuclear baryonic matter plays the key role in determining the maximum possible mass of neutron stars .",
    "the harder ( softer ) equation of state is , the larger ( smaller ) maximum mass can be .",
    "the equation of state of dense baryonic matter is also one of the essential ingredients that determines the dynamics of core - collapse supernovae and , in turn , the mass distribution of black holes in the universe @xcite .",
    "several characteristics of the gravitational wave emission from merging neutron stars @xcite , which may be observed , e.g. , by advanced laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo ) , are sensitive to the details of the equation of state .    from the theoretical viewpoint",
    ", currently there is no consensus even regarding the qualitative state of matter at the highest densities reached in stellar cores .",
    "the most conservative possibility is that such matter is made of only nucleonic degrees of freedom .",
    "the study of several neutron stars in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , does not exclude such a possibility , although a phase transition may be in agreement with their analysis , provided no extreme softening of the equation of state occurs . another astrophysical determination of masses and radii of three neutron stars in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests , however , that the actual equation of state is too soft to be pure nucleonic .",
    "such contradictory interpretations are representative and show that the current knowledge is too limited to settle the issue",
    ". theoretically , it may be also appropriate to mention that the observables associated with the equation of state alone have limited power to probe the actual nature of dense matter @xcite . in fact , a true insight regarding the stellar interior may require a comprehensive understanding not only of the thermodynamical , but also transport properties and neutrino emission rates of various possible states of superdense matter .    in this paper , we assume that baryonic matter at the highest stellar densities is deconfined quark matter .",
    "the possible formation of quark matter in stars is an old hypothesis @xcite that dates back to the time when the concept of quarks was first introduced @xcite .",
    "this is also supported by general considerations @xcite based on the property of asymptotic freedom in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "the main uncertainties of this scenario are ( i ) the value of the critical density , at which the deconfinement transition occurs , and ( ii ) the actual highest density reached in stars . if quark matter is formed , as we assume here , it is also likely to be a color - superconductor @xcite .",
    "( for reviews on color superconductivity and its general effects on stellar properties see , for example , refs .  @xcite . ) in this paper , in particular , we concentrate on the scenario , in which color superconductivity is due to same - flavor , spin - one cooper pairing @xcite .",
    "the fact of liberation of quark degrees of freedom and the formation of a color - superconducting state of matter is likely to be revealed through a detailed study of the observational features of neutron stars .",
    "for example , one promising class of observables is related to the rates of weak processes .",
    "such processes are known to be responsible for the cooling rates @xcite and damping of the rotational ( r - mode ) instabilities @xcite in stars .",
    "the cooling is primarily determined by the neutrino emission rate , while the damping of r - modes is controlled by the viscosity of dense matter @xcite .    the bulk viscosity in the normal phase of three - flavor quark matter is usually dominated by the nonleptonic weak processes  @xcite .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , however , that the interplay between the semi - leptonic and nonleptonic processes may be rather involved even in the normal phase of quark matter . indeed , because of the resonance - like dynamics responsible for the bulk viscosity and because of a subtle interference between the two types of the weak processes",
    ", a larger rate of the nonleptonic processes may not automatically mean its dominant role .",
    "in fact , it was shown that the contributions of the two types of weak processes are generally not separable and that , for a range of parameters , taking into account the semi - leptonic processes may substantially modify the nonleptonic result @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and study the effect that spin - one color superconductivity has on the bulk viscosity when the interplay between the two types of weak processes is carefully taken into account .",
    "( for calculation of the bulk viscosity in other color superconducting phases see refs .",
    "the necessary ingredients for the calculation of the bulk viscosity are the rates of semi - leptonic ( urca ) and nonleptonic weak processes . while the needed rates for the semi - leptonic processes in several spin - one color superconducting phases were obtained several years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , the corresponding rates of the nonleptonic processes remained unknown until very recently @xcite . here",
    "we utilize both to obtain the bulk viscosity .",

    "[ calculation ] to obtain our main results for the bulk viscosity as a function of temperature and the frequency of density oscillations .",
    "there we also study the enhancement effect of color superconductivity on the bulk viscosity , as well as the interplay of semi - leptonic and nonleptonic processes . in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the results and their potential implications for the physics of compact stars .",
    "two appendices at the end of the paper contain our fits for the numerical suppression factors of the semi - leptonic and nonleptonic rates in spin - one color superconducting strange quark matter .",
    "in this study , in order to calculate the bulk viscosity in the presence of several types of active weak processes , we follow the general formalism of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we assume that small oscillations of the quark matter density are described by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the magnitude of the oscillations .",
    "for such a periodic process , the bulk viscosity @xmath3 is defined as the coefficient in the expression for the energy - density dissipation averaged over one period , @xmath4 , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the hydrodynamic velocity associated with the density oscillations . by making use of the continuity equation , @xmath7 , we derive @xmath8 such an energy - density dissipation of a pulsating hydrodynamic flow is the outcome of a net work done on a macroscopic volume over a period of the oscillation , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the specific volume . by matching the hydrodynamic definition in eq .",

    "their net effect is to restore the equilibrium composition .",
    "however , since the weak rates are relatively slow , a substantial time lag between the oscillations of the fermion number density ( and , thus , the specific volume ) and the chemical composition ( and , thus , the pressure ) develops .",

    "<S> the bulk viscosity in spin - one color - superconducting strange quark matter is calculated by taking into account the interplay between the nonleptonic and semi - leptonic week processes . in agreement with previous studies </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the inclusion of the semi - leptonic processes may result in non - negligible corrections to the bulk viscosity in a narrow window of temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the effect is generally more pronounced for pulsars with longer periods . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the normal phase , however , this effect due to the semi - leptonic processes is less pronounced in spin - one color superconductors . assuming that the critical temperature of the phase transition is much larger than @xmath0 , the main effect of spin - one color superconductivity in a wide range of temperatures is an overall increase of the bulk viscosity with respect to the normal phase . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding enhancement factor reaches up to about 9 in the polar and _ a_-phases , about 25 in the planar phase and about 29 in the csl phase . </S>",
    "<S> this factor is determined by the suppression of the nonleptonic rate in color - superconducting matter and , therefore , may be even larger if all quark quasiparticles happen to be gapped . </S>"
