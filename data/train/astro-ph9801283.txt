    "low  mass x  ray binaries ( lmxbs ) are semi  detached compact binaries with a black hole ( bh ) or neutron star ( ns ) primary that accretes mass from an accretion disc .",
    "a roche lobe filling low - mass main  sequence or ( sub)giant star feeds the disc .",
    "lmxbs appear in two main varieties : they are either persistently bright , or have outbursts and long phases of quiescence ( e.g.  white & van  paradijs 1996 ) .",
    "the latter , known as soft x - ray transients ( sxts ; cf .",
    "tanaka & shibazaki 1996 and chen et al .",
    "1997 for reviews ) , are believed to have an unstable accretion disc which alternates between a hot and cool state ( cannizzo et al .",
    "1982 , taam & lin 1984 , cannizzo , chen & livio 1995 , king & ritter 1998 ) , similar to dwarf novae among cataclysmic variables .",
    "a simple criterion for stable disc accretion is that the temperature @xmath3 at the outer disc edge is larger than the hydrogen ionization temperature @xmath4 ( e.g.  king , kolb & burderi 1996 ; hereafter kkb ) . as @xmath3 increases with the mass transfer rate @xmath5 , a system is persistently bright if @xmath5 is larger than the critical rate @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the system is transient if @xmath8 .",
    "an important difference between dwarf novae and sxts is the dominant role irradiation of the accretion disc by the central accreting source plays in lmxbs .",
    "van paradijs ( 1996 ) showed that the observed critical transfer rate separating transient from persistent neutron star lmxbs is much lower than the critical rate separating dwarf novae from persistently bright ( novalike ) cataclysmic variables .",
    "this can be understood quantitatively by assuming that irradiation dominates over viscous heating at the outer disc rim , hence stabilizing the disc even at a smaller mass transfer rate .",
    "similarly , irradiation naturally explains the observed large ratio of optical to x  ray flux from the disc and the observed long , quasi ",
    "exponential decline after an sxt outburst ( king & ritter 1998 ) .",
    "models for the evolution of lmxbs predict the mass transfer rate and thus by comparison with @xmath6 the appearance of the system as a transient or persistently bright x  ray source ( assuming that the instantaneous transfer rate is close to the evolutionary mean transfer rate ) .",
    "this is a powerful diagnostic tool for testing evolutionary models , or , in turn , the disc instability model for sxts .",
    "king , kolb & szuszkiewicz ( 1997 ; hereafter kks ) , king et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and kkb investigated short ",
    "period systems with essentially unevolved donors , and long  period systems having low  mass giant donors with degenerate helium cores . in the following",
    "we extend this work , and present evolutionary models for black hole x  ray binaries ( bhxbs ) with intermediate ",
    "mass donors in the process of crossing the hertzsprung gap , a hitherto largely neglected parameter range .",
    "we explore to what extent such systems appear as sxts .",
    "a major motivation for this study is provided by recent optical observations of the transient x  ray source gro  j165540 ( orosz & bailyn 1997 ) , well  known from the apparent superluminal motion in its radio jets ( hjellming & rupen 1995 ) .",
    "system parameters derived for gro  j165540 place this bh binary just in the above parameter range dicussed here .",
    "some of the results presented below have already been applied to a discussion of the evolutionary state of gro  j165540 ( kolb et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we put intermediate  mass bhxbs into context by reviewing main concepts of lmxb evolution briefly in sect .  2 . in sect  3",
    "we present in detail three evolutionary sequences , with parameters close to the ones observed in gro  j165540 .",
    "we generalize the results of these calculations in sect .  4 in the form of three rules which approximately describe the general evolution of intermediate  mass bhbxs .",
    "these rules allow one to obtain a general overview of transient and persistent behaviour of all intermediate  mass bhxbs by just considering single star sequences of different mass . sect .",
    "5 concludes with a critical discussion .",
    "the mechanism driving mass transfer naturally divides lmxbs into two distinct classes . in the first group , nuclear expansion of",
    "the secondary maintains the semi ",
    "detached state , while in the second group , orbital angular momentum losses such as gravitational radiation and magnetic braking drive mass transfer . for convenience",
    "we denote neutron star or black hole lmxbs in the two groups with n  driven or j  driven systems .",
    "generally , n  driven lmxbs are long  period systems with ( sub)giant donor stars on the first giant branch .",
    "hydrogen burns in a shell source above a nuclearly inactive helium core .",
    "the orbital period increases until mass transfer terminates when core helium burning ignites , or when the hydrogen  rich envelope is fully transferred to the primary , whichever happens earlier .",
    "the final state is a wide , detached binary with a white dwarf secondary and a bh or ns primary ( possibly a millisecond pulsar ) .",
    "the lmxb lifetime depends on the initial secondary mass and orbital distance and can be as long as @xmath9  yr if both are small , but is typically @xmath10  yr .",
    "conversely , j  driven systems are short  period binaries with main  sequence donors and evolve to shorter orbital period . if the j  driven evolution is the same as for cataclysmic variables ( see e.g.  kolb 1996 , king 1988 for reviews ) the bright phase where magnetic braking operates ( @xmath11  h ) typically lasts @xmath12  yr . for @xmath13  h mass transfer continues indefinitely at a lower rate , but the period increases again when the secondary becomes degenerate , i.e.  when its mass is @xmath14 .    a critical bifurcation period @xmath15  days ( pylyser & savonije 1988 , 1989 ) separates j  driven and n  driven lmxbs .",
    "systems born with @xmath16 evolve towards shorter periods , and those born with @xmath17 towards longer @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the initial donor mass @xmath19 plays a role in determining the group membership : if @xmath20 the system is j  driven , as the donor s main  sequence lifetime is longer than a hubble time .",
    "if @xmath21 the system can not evolve to shorter orbital periods as magnetic braking does not operate in such massive stars , and gravitational radiation alone is too weak to dominate the evolution . in the intermediate range",
    "@xmath22 both groups exist .",
    "mass transfer stability defines an upper limit for the mass ratio @xmath23 ( @xmath24 is the donor mass , @xmath25 the primary mass ) , hence for @xmath24 and @xmath19 .",
    "this limit depends on the donor s response to mass loss ( hjellming 1989 ) , i.e.  is a non  trivial function of its evolutionary state . as a rule ,",
    "the limit is roughly @xmath26 in the case of conservative mass transfer , but can be somewhat larger with mass loss from the system ( cf .",
    "kalogera & webbink 1996 , where the ns case is discussed in detail ) .",
    "if the donor is more massive the system suffers a short , violent phase of mass transfer / loss and is unlikely to appear as an x  ray source . obviously , neutron star x - ray binaries with roche  lobe filling donors more massive than @xmath27 do not exist , while there is no such upper limit for bhxbs , hence no clear separation between low  mass and high  mass bhxbs . the importance of bhxbs with intermediate ",
    "mass donors was first pointed out by romani ( 1994 ) .",
    "recently , two limiting cases of lmxb evolution have been considered to determine the incidence of transient behaviour among lmxbs : kkb and kks described the j  driven evolution of completely unevolved ( zams ) donors .",
    "they found that bh systems are always transient , consistent with observations , and that donor stars in ns systems need to be very close to the end of core h burning in order to be transient , consistent with the observed small fraction of transient ns lmxbs .",
    "king et al .  ( 1997 ) and kks studied n  driven lmxbs with low ",
    "mass donor stars well  established on the first giant branch , and found that essentially all of them are transient .",
    "they considered giant donors with a thin h burning shell source above a degenerate he core where the stellar radius @xmath28 and luminosity @xmath29 are unique functions , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , of the slowly growing core mass @xmath32 , essentially independent of the total stellar mass ( e.g.  webbink , rappaport & savonije 1983 ) .",
    "stars with mass @xmath33 indeed establish such a structure soon after the end of central h burning and spend a considerable time ascending the first giant branch , before the ignition of helium burning in the centre terminates their radius expansion .",
    "most n  driven ns lmxbs are well described in this way , but not bhxbs with more massive donor stars ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "these ignite core helium burning before the core becomes highly degenerate , i.e.  before the first giant branch evolution governed by the above core mass relations takes hold . simplified descriptions for the evolution of these stars fail , and full stellar models are needed .",
    "we consider these n  driven intermediate ",
    "mass bhxbs in the next sections .",
    "the binary evolutionary phase we consider here is case b mass transfer : the donor star fills its roche lobe after termination of core h burning but before the ignition of core he burning .",
    "case b mass transfer is well  studied ( e.g.  kippenhahn et al .",
    "1967 , pylyser & savonije 1988 , kolb & ritter 1990 , de  greve 1993 ) in the context of algol evolution .",
    "all these studies assume that the donor is more massive than the accretor , simply because the faster evolving more massive component always fills its roche lobe first . in bhxbs , with a more complicated evolutionary history , case b mass transfer begins with an already inverted mass ratio , i.e.  the donor is less massive than the bh .",
    "hence there is no initial rapid phase with extremely high transfer rate .    in the following we present calculations of three case",
    "b mass transfer sequences on to a bh primary from a secondary with initial mass close to the transition region between degenerate and non  degenerate helium ignition .",
    "we report briefly on the numerical technique and associated problems ( sect .",
    "3.1 ) , describe in detail the evolution of the secondary star ( sect .",
    "3.2 ) , and then focus on the resulting appearance in x",
    " rays along the sequences in sect .  3.3 .",
    "we used mazzitelli s stellar evolution code in a version as described by mazzitelli ( 1989 ; see also references therein ) with pre  opal opacities .",
    "the computations started from chemically homogenous zams models with population i mixture ( @xmath35 , @xmath36 ) .",
    "convection is treated by the standard mixing length theory ; a calibration to a solar model determines the mixing length parameter to @xmath37 ( no overshooting was allowed ) .    to allow the application to binary evolution",
    "the mass transfer rate @xmath5 was calculated for each time step according to @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "kolb & ritter 1990 ) , where @xmath39 is the difference between the secondary s radius @xmath28 and roche lobe radius @xmath40 , @xmath41 the atmospheric pressure scale height , and @xmath42 a numerical constant , usually taken as @xmath43 .",
    "although ( [ eq1 ] ) is strictly valid only for @xmath44 and has to be replaced by an expression with an approximate power ",
    "law dependence on @xmath45 for @xmath46 , we use ( [ eq1 ] ) for any @xmath47 . furthermore , to avoid numerical instabilities at high transfer rates we set @xmath48 for @xmath49 yr@xmath50 .",
    "this procedure is justified as long as @xmath51 ( kolb & ritter 1990 ) , i.e.  as long as the stellar radius is close to the critical roche radius .",
    "for the sequences presented here this is always the case .",
    "a high  resolution reference sequence with @xmath43 was calculated to check the validity of sequences obtained with @xmath48 explicitly in the case of sequence s3 ( see below ) .",
    "attempts to retain the damping factor @xmath48 also in later phases ( where @xmath52 ) failed as @xmath53 becomes non ",
    "negligible for extended giants .",
    "a damped evolution would proceed qualitatively differently from the true evolution with @xmath43 , leading to higher mass transfer rates and a correpondingly earlier termination of mass transfer .",
    "lllll sequence & @xmath54 & @xmath55 & @xmath56 & int + s1 ( initial ) & 6.8 & 2.5 & 13.2 & b860 + s2 ( initial ) & 6.8 & 2.5 & 15.2 & b849 + s3 ( initial ) & 6.8 & 2.5 & 18.5 & b830/32 + s3 ( final ) & 8.726 & 0.574 & 213.1 & +    all three binary sequences , s1s3 , begin mass transfer with a @xmath0 donor star and a @xmath57 black hole .",
    "the initial orbital separation is @xmath58 ( s1 ) , @xmath59 ( s2 ) and @xmath60 ( s3 ) , see the summary in tab .  1 .",
    "mass transfer is conservative , i.e.  the total binary mass and orbital angular momentum is constant .",
    "sequence s3 follows the donor star until ignition of central helium burning .",
    "the subsequent evolution is detached , and we evolved the secondary further through central helium burning and the brief subsequent asymptotic giant branch phase with weak thermal pulses .",
    "in contrast , sequences s1 and s2 have been terminated once the secondary was established on the first giant branch .    in figs .  1",
    " 5 we show characteristic parameters along the sequences s1s3 , sometimes together with the evolution of a @xmath61 single star ( for convenience referred to as sequence s0 ) .",
    "figure  1 ( upper panel ) reveals that the overall radius evolution with time is very similar in all sequences s0s3 , except for the `` plateau phase '' soon after mass transfer turn  on , which corresponds to a brief radius contraction phase at the red end of the hertzsprung gap of s0 .",
    "this phase occurs at a characteristic radius , the `` plateau radius '' @xmath62 , and will be examined in more detail below .",
    "the similarity shows that significant mass loss from the outer envelope has little effect on the overall expansion of the donor star , which is governed by the nuclear evolution of the core region .",
    "the overall temporal evolution of the surface luminosity @xmath29 is systematically different for sequences with and without mass transfer ( fig .",
    "2 ) : in s1s3 mass loss causes a steep build - up of gravo  thermal luminosity @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) and a slight reduction of the nuclear luminosity @xmath65 from the hydrogen shell source .",
    "this behaviour is superimposed on the luminosity evolution pattern of s0 in the hertzsprung gap , where hydrogen burning changes from a thick to a thin shell .",
    "the net effect is that thin hydrogen shell burning is established earlier , at a slightly smaller core mass .",
    "once thin h burning is fully established the luminosity grows with further growing core mass .",
    "the corresponding effective core mass  luminosity relation is much steeper than the standard relation @xmath66 for fully degenerate cores , and meets the latter one only immediately before core helium ignition ( fig .",
    "3 ) . as a result ,",
    "the secondary in s1s3 begins its ascent along the first giant branch at a significantly smaller surface luminosity than the @xmath61 single star .",
    "the drop of @xmath29 , a familiar feature of case b mass transfer , goes along with a correspondingly fast decrease of @xmath67 to @xmath68 , i.e.  the secondary in the mass loss sequence crosses the hertzsprung gap even faster than the @xmath61 single star ( fig .  1 , lower panel ) . roughly , at any time along s1s3 in the hertzsprung gap , @xmath29 and @xmath67 are the same as for a single star with the same mass and radius as the secondary star at that time .    with the ignition of helium burning the secondary s radius decreases sharply and mass",
    "transfer terminates . at this point",
    "the binary parameters of s3 are @xmath69 , @xmath70 ( with core mass @xmath71 ) and @xmath72  days , @xmath73 ( see tab .  1 ) . for the next @xmath74  myr the secondary burns helium in the centre and is well inside its roche lobe ( @xmath75 versus @xmath76 ) .",
    "subsequently , he burning moves to a shell source and the radius increases again , at a core mass of @xmath77 .",
    "the ensuing double shell burning is unstable and leads to thermal pulses .",
    "we find that these pulses are rather weak , with decreasing maximum radius .",
    "the radius maximum in subsequent pulses is always smaller than the roche radius ( though not very much ) , and quickly decreasing . eventually the secondary contracts towards the white dwarf stage .",
    "if there are no significant wind losses during the thermal pulses the final state of s3 is a wide , detached binary with a @xmath78 black hole primary , a @xmath79 carbon  oxygen white dwarf companion and @xmath80 months orbital period .",
    "we distinguish transient from persistent bhxbs by comparing the mass transfer rate @xmath5 with the critical rate @xmath6 for which hydrogen just ionizes at the outer disc edge .",
    "a system is transient if @xmath8 . in fig .",
    "4 we plot @xmath5 as a function of time along sequences s1s3 .",
    "the linestyle is broken if @xmath8 , with @xmath6 taken from kks .",
    "obviously , the accretion disc is stable for about @xmath81  myr when the secondary crosses the hertzsprung gap , and the transfer rate is close to ( or slightly above ) the eddington limit @xmath82 ( assuming an effective accretion efficiency @xmath83 ) .",
    "the system becomes a transient source soon after it begins to ascend along the hayashi line , and remains transient until helium ignites in the centre @xmath84  myr later .",
    "significantly , there is also a short transient phase ( lasting @xmath85  myr ) right _ in _ the hertzsprung gap , centered around @xmath86 .",
    "this phase is caused by the transition from thick to thin shell source burning , the same effect that leads to a brief radius contraction when the @xmath61 single star crosses the hertzsprung gap .",
    "the associated change of the internal structure of the star is highly non  linear and complex .",
    "just as the ultimate cause for the expansion to the red giant state can not be easily derived from a simple analysis of the stellar structure equations , there is no easy way to understand this temporary halt in the expansion either .",
    "the hertzsprung gap transient phase in s1s3 and the radius contraction phase of s0 all occur at the same range of @xmath67 ( fig .  5 ) , while the corresponding plateau radius @xmath62 is largest for s0 , and progressively smaller the earlier mass transfer began in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "the secondary mass in the plateau phase is @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 for sequences s1 , s2 and s3 , respectively .",
    "in fact , @xmath90 is practically the same as the plateau radius of a single star with the secondary s mass in the plateau phase .",
    "details of the exact location ( e.g.  the radius @xmath62 ) , duration and depth of the radius contraction phase of a single star must necessarily depend on details of the stellar input physics , in particular on opacities and treatment of convection .",
    "as an example , the @xmath0 single star track obtained by salaris et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with opal opacities shows a much less pronounced radius contraction phase at a slightly higher effective temperature ( @xmath91 ) than our sequence s0 .",
    "hence we do not expect our models to reproduce the precise location of the real transient phase in the hertzsprung gap , and the actual mass transfer rate in this phase .",
    "but our sequences certainly show the differential change of that phase with varying initial orbital distance : the earlier mass transfer starts in the hertzsprung gap , the less pronounced the decrease of @xmath5 in the transient phase .",
    "if the secondary is already very close to the plateau phase when it fills its roche lobe for the first time , the system might almost detach in the transient phase and not appear as an x - ray source at all ; but if the system begins mass transfer early in the hertsprung gap it certainly will .",
    "we formulate three rules which summarize the behaviour of the above evolutionary sequences and provide an approximate description for the case b evolution of intermediate  mass bhxbs .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( r1 ) the overall time evolution @xmath92 of the donor star radius in a binary sequence with initial donor mass @xmath19 is the same as the time evolution of the radius of a single star with mass @xmath93 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    while    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( r2 ) the plateau phase ( the brief contraction phase or slow  down of the expansion phase ) in the hertzsprung gap occurs at a donor radius @xmath62 equal to the plateau radius of a single star with the donor s mass _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ ( r3 ) a donor star with mass @xmath24 and radius @xmath28 has the same effective temperature @xmath94 ( and surface luminosity @xmath29 ) as a single star with mass @xmath95 and radius @xmath28 _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    in other words : the timescale of the overall radius expansion is given by the initial donor mass , while the surface appearance and the plateau phase is given by the current donor mass .    in the following we use these rules to investigate the incidence of transient and persistent behaviour in intermediate ",
    "mass bhxbs with arbitrary initial mass and initial separation , simply by considering the evolution of single stars in this mass range .",

    "we now consider the location of evolutionary sequences in fig .",
    "7 , and discuss the relevance of @xmath125 and @xmath118 for them . after turn  on of mass transfer a binary evolves to smaller @xmath24 and longer @xmath18 . in the case of conservative evolution",
    "the evolutionary tracks follow curves with @xmath126  const .",
    "( @xmath127 is the total binary mass ) , see the tracks of sequences s1s3 . in binaries with larger initial donor mass ( @xmath128 ) the transfer rate is super  eddington and the evolution non  conservative .",
    "the primary accretes at @xmath121 , and surplus material leaves the system at a rate @xmath129 , carrying some specific angular momentum ( of order the bh s specific orbital angular momentum ) determined by details of how and where the material is accelerated . in this case",
    "the mass transfer rate is slightly lower and the period increase significantly faster than for conservative evolution , i.e.  the evolutionary tracks would have a slightly larger slope @xmath130 ( cf .",
    "the example in fig .  8) .",
    "a simple corollary of ( r2 ) is that a system will reach the transient plateau phase when its evolutionary track crosses the instability strip in fig .",
    "this is because @xmath125 is a unique function of the donor mass , independent of the initial donor mass .",
    "in contrast , as the initial donor mass dictates the mass transfer rate outside the plateau phase , we can expect that the critical period where the system changes from a persistently bright to a transient x  ray source is close to @xmath131 . then , as a consequence of the opposite slopes of evolutionary tracks and the curve @xmath131 in fig .",
    "7 , a system remains persistently bright when its track leaves the unhatched region , and becomes transient only later when its period roughly equals @xmath131 .",
    "the sequences s1s3 ( solid where persistent , broken where transient ; heavy dots mark the plateau phase ) and actual integrations of ( [ eq3 ] ) confirm this . hence no system in the unhatched region is transient , it is a `` transient exclusion zone '' , bisected by the hertzsprung gap instability strip . the hatched region , on the other hand , may contain both persistently bright and transient systems .",
    "8 shows how the transient exclusion zone depends on the bh mass @xmath25 . as @xmath25 increases the steep branch of @xmath132 moves to larger @xmath24 , while the flat branch moves to longer @xmath18 . the bh mass does not affect the location of the instability strip",
    "in extension of the work by kkb , kks and king et al .",
    "1997 we studied the evolution of bhxbs with intermediate  mass giant donor stars in the context of the disc instability model for soft x - ray transients .",
    "these represent a hitherto somewhat neglected group of systems with very high mass transfer rates and donors spending a significant fraction of the x  ray active time in crossing the hertzsprung gap .",
    "we find that although systems in the process of crossing the hertzsprung gap are in general persistently bright with eddington- or super  eddington transfer rates , there is a narrow instability strip where transient behaviour is possible .",
    "this strip extends over a secondary mass range @xmath133 and is roughly given by @xmath134 , but the precise location is subject to uncertainties in the stellar input physics .",
    "we predict that bhxbs in the hertzsprung gap are not transient if the donor is more massive than @xmath135 , and that neutron star lmxb transients in the hertzsprung gap do not exist .",
    "the latter is a consequence of a number of factors : in neutron star lmxbs the upper ( stability ) limit for the donor mass is smaller , the mass transfer rate is larger as the systems are closer to mass transfer instability , and the critical rate @xmath6 is possibly lower by almost an order of magnitude ( see kks ) .    in our considerations",
    "we relate the evolutionary state of a system to the stability of its accretion disc , hence its appearance in x  rays , by comparing the evolutionary mean mass transfer rate @xmath5 to the critical transfer rate @xmath6 for disc instability . both the identification of the actual , instantaneous mass transfer rate with @xmath5 and the normalisation of @xmath6 are subject to some uncertainties :    if the actual mass transfer rate deviated from the calculated evolutionary mean the system could of course be transient where it is predicted to be persistently bright , and vice versa .",
    "although such deviations from the secular mean rate are quite common in cvs ( e.g.  warner 1987 ) there is no observational evidence for a similar large scatter of the mass transfer rate at a given orbital period in lmxbs ( cf .",
    "van  paradijs 1996 ; chen , shrader & livio 1997 ) . also , the most promising theoretical explanation for the observed spread of @xmath5 in cvs is that the systems undergo mass transfer limit cycles caused by weak irradiation of the secondary ( ritter , zhang & kolb 1995 ; king et al .",
    "1996 ) . in lmxbs",
    "this mechanism does not work as the irradiating flux on the secondary is too large ( cf .",
    "king 1998 ) .",
    "hence it seems not unlikely that the actual transfer rate is close to the evolutionary mean .",
    "the theoretical value of the critical rate @xmath6 depends on a number of not very well determined quantities .",
    "most notably these are the hydrogen ionization temperature in the disc , the relative disc thickness , the accretion efficiency @xmath136 and the albedo .",
    "a major justification for the adopted normalisation comes from the fact that it matches the observed location of the critical rate separating transient from persistent sources ( van  paradijs 1996 )",
    ". the remaining uncertainty in the normalisation of @xmath6 does not affect the main results of this study , i.e. the existence and location of the transient instability strip in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "this is a result of the steep gradient @xmath137 of the transfer rate in this phase .",
    "the transient x  ray source gro  j165540 is the first confirmed member of the class of intermediate ",
    "mass bhxbs considered in this paper .",
    "gro  j165540 is also close to the sxt instability strip and , given the uncertainties in both the theoretical and observed values , might actually be a system right in the instability strip , consistent with its transient nature ( e.g.  harmon et al .",
    "1995 , tavani et al .",
    "1996 , levine et al .",
    "1996 ) . implications of this interpretation are discussed elsewhere ( kolb et al .",
    "particular problems arise from the apparent lack of persistently bright systems with similar parameters in the hertzsprung gap .",
    "it was suggested that these are not seen in x  rays as their effective photosphere might radiate at much longer wavelengths .",
    "alternatively , gro  j165540 could be one of the predicted systems in the hertzsprung gap with a stable accretion disc .",
    "it is by no means clear if such systems do appear as persistently bright sources .",
    "instabilities in the accretion flow might cause dramatic changes in the effective photosphere , causing variability in a given waveband .",
    "kolb et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested such a mechanism also for grs  1915 + 105 , the other x  ray source with apparent superluminal motion .    a second possible intermediate ",
    "mass bhxb is 4u  1543 - 47 .",
    "recently , orosz et al .  (",
    "1998 ) determined its orbital period as 1.123  d and found that the components are likely to be a @xmath138 bh and a @xmath139 main  sequence donor .",
    "this places the system below the turn  off main  sequence period ( @xmath140 )",
    "line in fig .",
    "7 ( dash  dotted ; note that @xmath141 as shown in the equivalent fig .  2 of kolb et al .",
    "1997 is slightly too small due to a calibration error ) .",
    "therefore 4u  1543 - 47 is , unlike gro  j165540 , in a phase of case a mass transfer where the transfer rate is determined by the donor s nuclear timescale . with @xmath142 and replacing @xmath103 in ( [ eq3 ] ) by the nuclear expansion @xmath104 on the main sequence we estimate @xmath143  yr@xmath50 , well below the critical rate kks find for transient behaviour in bhxbs ( but slightly above the critical rate claimed for neutron star systems , cf .",
