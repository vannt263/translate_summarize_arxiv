    "count rates greater than @xmath16 from the mean were removed using * deflare*. the light curves were visually inspected to ensure flares were effectively removed .",
    "point sources were removed by first using the * wavdetect * task in ciao and then making manual corrections as necessary to ensure all contaminating point sources are excluded and no false detections were allowed .",
    "the regions which enclosed point sources were also removed from the backgrounds to prevent over - subtracting the background .",
    "the above steps were followed to create the clean data and background files for each observations separately .",

    "this is done in order to have all the counts images from individual observations cropped to the same dimensions and covering the same part of the sky .    in order to make temperature maps from the combined data , we use two techniques : a ) weighted voronoi tessellation ( wvt ) method and b ) adaptive circular binning ( acb ) method . in the following subsections",
    ", we will discuss in details the advantages and limitations of each of the two methods .",
    "we use the weighted voronoi tessellation ( wvt ) binning algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the use of adaptive spatial binning using voronoi tessellations was first suggested by @xcite for integral field spectroscopic data .",
    "later , @xcite generalized it for x - ray data analysis .",
    "wvt binning has been widely used in deriving x - ray temperatures @xcite and specifically to derive x - ray temperature maps for galaxy clusters [ e.g. a4059 @xcite , a3128 @xcite , a2052 @xcite , a2744 @xcite , a2254 @xcite , a1201 @xcite , 1rxs j0603.3 + 4214 @xcite , cena @xcite ] .",
    "our current work is the first attempt to derive an x - ray temperature map for a3667 using the wvt technique .",
    "non - overlapping wvt regions are defined by the wvt - binning algorithm based on a given signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "the snr is calculated after combining all eight clean data and the clean background files for a3667 .",
    "the signal is equal to the background - subtracted counts and the noise assumes poisson uncertainty contributions from both the source and background .",
    "the background counts have been rescaled by the ratio of the source and background exposure times for the wvt - binning operation . in this case , we have used a snr of 50 to define the wvt regions .",
    "for the combined eight observations of a3667 , wvt - binning produced @xmath17 regions with a snr scatter @xmath18 .",
    "once the regions are defined , we use the _ ciao _ task * dmextract * to extract separate source and background spectra from the same region of the acis - i detector corresponding to each wvt region . for each wvt region , the source and background spectra are extracted for different observations separately . the weighted response matrix file ( wrmf ) and effective area function ( warf )",
    "are generated using the _ ciao _ task * specextract * using a region covering most of the field - of - view of the detector .",
    "a set of wrmf and warf files are obtained for each observation .",
    "we have used _ xspec _ 12.8 to perform spectral fitting between 0.7 to 8.0 kev .",
    "the _ apec _ thermal plasma model along with the _ phabs _ photo - electric absorption model were used to fit the spectra from each wvt region .",
    "the redshift of the cluster was kept fixed at @xmath4 .",
    "the hydrogen column density was fixed at @xmath19 , as obtained from the lab survey @xcite near the location of the cluster . in order to combine all eight observations",
    ", we have simultaneously fit all eight spectra from each wvt region in _",
    "xspec _ using the c - statistic @xcite .",
    "the metallicity of the cluster was kept fixed at @xmath20 @xcite . only the temperature and the _ apec _ normalization were fit for each region .",
    "the wvt temperature map along with the error map were obtained .",
    "later , the temperature map was adaptively smoothed using a variant of the _ asmooth _ program developed by @xcite .",
    "the adaptively smoothed wvt temperature map is shown in figure  [ fig : atemp_wvt](a ) .",

    "this error map also shows the exact location and size of the wvt regions .",
    "the errors are estimated inside _ xspec _ using a markov chain monte carlo technique with chain length of 10,000 .",
    "the plus ( @xmath23 ) and minus ( @xmath24 ) errors are calculated at @xmath25 level .",
    "the resultant error @xmath26 is the mean of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",

    "figure  [ fig : aterr_dist ] shows the distribution of the @xmath29 with respect to the best - fitted @xmath22 values . from this figure we can conclude that there is a definite trend confirming that the regions with higher temperatures have higher errors .",
    "this is expected as the _ chandra _ instrument response deteriorates at higher energies .",
    "figure  [ fig : aterr_dist ] also shows that the distribution of @xmath24 and @xmath23 are different .",
    "we compared our wvt temperature map with the existing x - ray temperature maps by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite from xmm newton observations .",
    "our adaptively smoothed wvt temperature map ( figure  [ fig : atemp_wvt](a ) ) recovers the basic features seen in previous xmm studies @xcite .",
    "however , the higher exposure time for the combined _ chandra _ observations allowed us to derive a higher resolution temperature map than the above studies .",
    "the a3667 temperature map from @xcite also combined all the eight _ chandra _ observations , but their temperature map is limited to a very small region around the cold front .",
    "the temperature values near the cold front in our current wvt map ( figure  [ fig : atemp_wvt](a ) ) are in agreement with that in @xcite .",
    "the lowest temperature in figure  [ fig : atemp_wvt](a ) occurs near the inner edge of the cold front and is about @xmath30  kev . there is a high temperature region behind the cold front towards the north - west where temperatures rise up to @xmath31  kev .",
    "the wvt method creates non - overlapping regions within which a spectrum is extracted .",
    "so the temperatures between adjacent wvt regions are independent .",
    "this is advantageous in propagating errors in fitted temperatures to derived quantities like temperature jumps , mach number , pressure , entropy , etc .",
    "the major limitation of the wvt method is that temperature structure depends on the wvt bin locations .",
    "these bin locations are not unique and depend on the initial conditions of the bin accretion in the wvt - binning algorithm @xcite .",
    "hence , a slight change in the input snr criteria or the starting location of the bin - accretion can create slightly different wvt temperature maps . since the bins are non - overlapping , the wvt method might miss a feature that is lower than the size of the bin at particular location on the map . in order to verify whether we have missed any crucial feature in the a3667 wvt temperature due to this limitation of the algorithm ,",
    "we have used another technique that we call adaptive circular binning ( acb ) in the next section .",
    "the acb method is based on extracting spectra from a circular region centered on a particular pixel in the map . unlike the wvt method",
    ", the acb circles from adjacent pixels can significantly overlap with each other .",
    "the size of the acb circles depends on the input snr criteria ( similar to the wvt regions ) .",
    "it should be noted that x - ray temperature maps have been previously produced using a technique similar to the acb method [ e.g. m86 @xcite , a133 @xcite , a2744 @xcite , a2443 @xcite ] .",
    "previous works have used either a cut - off in counts or background subtracted counts to derive the circular region . in order to be consistent with the wvt method",
    ", we derive acb circles based on the snr criteria ( same as in wvt method ) .",
    "the steps followed in the acb method include :    1 .",
    "use the native pixels in the combined counts images for both the clean source and background images .",
    "2 .   for each pixel",
    ", we define a circular region ( centered on that pixel ) .",
    "the radius of a circle is such that the snr calculated from the source and background images is about 50 ( same as in wvt binning method ) .",
    "the signal is equal to the background - subtracted counts and the noise assumes poisson uncertainty contributions from both the source and background .",
    "3 .   spectra from both the clean source and background data ( from each observation ) are then extracted for the corresponding circular region for that pixel .",
    "the spectral extraction is done with _",
    "task * dmextract*. 4 .   the weighted response matrix file ( wrmf ) and effective area function ( warf ) are generated using the _ ciao _ task * specextract * using a region covering most of the field - of - view of the detector .",
    "a set of wrmf and warf files are obtained for each observations .",
    "5 .   for each pixel",
    ", we then simultaneously fit spectra for all eight observations using _ xspec _ 12.8 .",
    "the _ apec _ thermal plasma model along with the _ phabs _ photo - electric absorption model were used to fit the spectra from each pixel between 0.7 and 8.0 kev .",
    "the redshift of a3667 , the @xmath32 value and the metallicity are kept fixed for _ xspec _ fitting at the same value as in wvt binning method .",
    "the temperature and the _ apec _ normalization were kept free to be fitted ( same as in section  [ sec : wvt ] ) .",
    "apart from the process of defining the acb regions , most of the other steps are common between both acb and wvt . in the case of acb ,",
    "the total number of regions are equal to the total number of image pixels within the combined detector area .",
    "for a3667 , acb method produced @xmath33 regions .",
    "all the initial data analysis within _ ciao _ , to produce the clean data - sets , as well as the wvt temperature maps were carried out in a 32 core cluster machine with a total of 64 gb shared ram . to process these large number of acb regions",
    ", we used @xmath34  cores of the janus supercomputer at university of colorado boulder for a total of @xmath35  hours .",
    "while wvt produces regions with no overlap , the acb region for a pixel has significant overlap with the acb regions of the nearby pixels .",
    "the overlap area depends on the snr around that pixel location on the detector .",
    "the acb temperature map is shown in figure  [ fig : atemp_acb](a ) .",
    "this temperature map is not smoothed further unlike the wvt temperature map .",
    "the corresponding @xmath25 errors ( @xmath21 ) , in percentages , are shown in figure  [ fig : atemp_acb](b ) .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath27 of the pixels have @xmath28 errors in temperature .",
    "the errors are estimated in the same manner as in section  [ sec : wvt ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : aterr_dist ] shows the distribution of the @xmath24 and @xmath23 errors with respect to the best - fitted @xmath22 values .",
    "this again confirms that pixels with higher temperatures have higher errors ( same as in section  [ sec : wvt ] ) .",
    "the acb temperature map has the overall same features as the wvt image ( figure  [ fig : atemp_wvt](a ) ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : atemp_acb](b ) we have overlayed some of the acb circles on the error map .",
    "it should be noted that the scales of the acb circles are minimum near the inner edge of the cold front and gradually grow to the outskirts of the field - of - view . comparing figures  [ fig : atemp_wvt ] and [ fig : atemp_acb ]",
    ", we can confirm that the wvt regions are small enough to be able capture the overall temperature structure of the a3667 like the acb method .",
    "this is possible due to the high snr for the combined observations of a3667 .",
    "the temperature values in figure  [ fig : atemp_acb](a ) are in agreement with the x - ray temperature map of a3667 in @xcite , where they used a method similar to acb . however , our current acb temperature map has a higher resolution near the cold front and larger field - of - view than that in @xcite .",
    "we have extracted spectra for every pixel of the map around the cold front in order to get the sharpest profile of thermodynamic quantities across the cold front .",
    "it is possible that @xcite might have used a lower resolution map to extract fewer number of spectra .",
    "comparing our current acb map with @xcite as well as previous xmm studies @xcite , we conclude that our acb temperature map has a combination of the highest resolution and largest field - of - view produced to date for a3667 .",
    "the magnitude of the error map also supports this map to be the highest fidelity x - ray temperature map for a3667 .",
    "unfortunately , _",
    "observations do not extend to the north - west relic region .",
    "hence , xmm observations by @xcite is the only study to estimate x - ray temperatures and shocks near the radio relic .    in figure  [",
    "fig : ape ] we show the pseudo - pressure and pseudo - entropy maps derived from the smoothed x - ray surface brightness map and the acb temperature map .",
    "the pseudo - pressure is calculated as @xmath36 and pseudo - entropy is calculated as @xmath37 .",
    "the pseudo - pressure shows a very smooth variation near the cold front , confirming it as a contact discontinuity",
    ". this will be more clear in section  [ sec : cf ] when we will derive the actual pressure profile across the cold front .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear from the pseudo - entropy map that there is a strong jump near the location of the cold front .",
    "entropy is lower inside the cold front as compared to the outside .",
    "the pseudo - entropy map also confirms the cold front .",
    "the resolution of the entropy map is much higher than seen in previous studies with xmm - newton @xcite .",
    "galaxy cluster formation is a violent process in which subclusters crash onto clusters at generally supersonic velocities creating shocks .",
    "shocks are fundamental in understanding the baryonic processes in the clusters because they convert gravitational potential energy into thermal energy , thus heating the icm @xcite and allowing the cluster gas to approach hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "there are mainly two types of shocks in the hot icm plasma .",
    "accretion shocks arise at larger distances ( @xmath38 several mpc ) from the cluster center .",
    "cosmological simulations @xcite predict that the much cooler igm ( inter - galactic medium ) accretes onto the clusters through a system of shocks producing mach numbers @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the merger shocks arise as sub - halos fall into the main clusters producing moderate shocks with @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "one of the major goals of this paper is to study the x - ray shocks using the highest resolution temperature maps derived in the previous section . in order to systematically find shocks across the entire field - of - view of the combined _ chandra _ observations we developed an automated shock - finder",
    "this is adapted from the method described in @xcite for numerical simulations of galaxy clusters where they use a systematic and unbiased method of searching for shocks in the 3-dimensional cluster environment .",
    "their technique relies on a temperature - jump based shock - finder as described in @xcite .",
    "the temperature jump is preferable to density jump as the former is more sensitive to the mach number .",
    "in contrast , the density jump quickly asymptotes for strong shocks @xcite .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot temperature jump condition is used to calculate the mach number as : @xmath41 in the 3-dimensional shock - finding algorithm , used in cosmological simulations , a pixel is determined to have a shock if it meets the following criteria @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the velocity field , @xmath44 is the temperature , @xmath45 is the density and @xmath46 is the entropy . at each pixel ,",
    "the 3-dimensional shock - finder calculates the jump in temperature and surface brightness in both grid directions .",
    "a pixel is marked as a shock if the temperature gradient and surface brightness gradient have the same sign since the temperature and density both increase from pre - shock to post - shock .",
    "the mach number is then calculated from the temperature jump using equation  [ eq : tempjump ] .",
    "this 3-dimensional shock - finder is applied to a simulated mhd cluster ( discussed in section  [ sec : sim ] ) .",
    "since the observations are restricted to the plane of the sky , we have modified the 3-dimensional shock - finder to work on 2-dimensional projected x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps . in this modified scenario ,",
    "the shock - finder calculates the jump in temperature and surface brightness in @xmath47 evenly placed directions centering on a given pixel . for a3667 , we have used @xmath48 .",
    "the shock - finder then accepts those pixel - pairs between which the conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( a proxy for @xmath51 in observations ) in equation  [ eq : jump_cond ] are satisfied .",
    "the other two conditions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , in equation [ eq : jump_cond ] can not be used in the case of observations .",
    "the mach number for each successful pixel - pair is noted . the mach number with the maximum value is chosen to be the resultant mach number for that given pixel . to choose the pixel - pairs in each direction we use a jump - length from the corresponding scalemap , which gives the size of the voronoi region or the radius of the acb circle for that given pixel .",
    "a fiducial multiplicative factor is also applied on the scale - lengths to define the jump - length. the multiplicative factor has been varied to assess the scale appropriate for detecting the shocks . in these cases",
    ", we found the factor of 1.25 is appropriate for the mach number estimation .",
    "detailed description of this observational shock - finder is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the resultant mach number map for a3667 is shown in figure  [ fig : amach ] for both the wvt and acb temperature maps .",
    "the mach numbers are @xmath54 in all cases and consistent with those found in the cores of numerically simulated clusters @xcite . for our observational shock - finder ,",
    "the resolution of the mach number map directly depends on the resolution of the temperature map .",
    "since the acb map has a higher resolution , the resolution of the mach number map for acb is higher than that in the case of wvt .",
    "moreover , the acb mach numbers are mostly around 1.5 - 1.6 , whereas that in wvt are mostly between 1.1 - 1.2 . the comparison between the mach number distributions from wvt and acb temperature maps are shown in figure  [ fig : ahist ] .",
    "since the mach number distribution from the wvt method suffers strongly from the size scales of the wvt bins and are mostly restricted below mach number of 1.5 , we will use the mach number distribution from the acb temperature map for future comparison with the simulations in section  [ sec : compxrs ]    in order to validate the observational shock - finder , we will compare it with the original shock - finder which operates on the 3-dimensional cosmological simulations in section  [ sec : compxrs ] .",
    "since the combined _ chandra _ observations for a3667 do not extend beyond the central @xmath15  mpc region around the center of the cluster , we will use previous radio observations of a3667 @xcite which extend to the outskirts of the cluster . in the following sections , we will compare the combined shock statistics from x - ray and radio data of a3667 with the results from the 3-dimensional shock - finder on the cosmological amr mhd simulations .",
    "galaxy clusters are formed due to collapse of density fluctuations involving comoving scales of @xmath55  mpc which contribute to their large mass ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "evolution of structure of the universe is mainly driven by gravity at this regime .",
    "the growth and evolution of galaxy clusters can be very accurately modeled in cosmological simulations [ see @xcite , for a review ] .",
    "the adoption of adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) techniques for cosmological simulations @xcite has increased the spatial and temporal resolution of the cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in the region of interest . due to this , the shock - capturing gas dynamics schemes have improved and are able to trace the galaxy cluster evolution more accurately .    from the observations of galaxy clusters like a3667 at multi - wavelengths ( x - ray , optical , radio , etc ) one can only infer the cluster properties as projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "unlike observations , current state - of - the - art amr simulations trace the entire 3-dimensional evolution of the galaxy clusters . hence , a combination of the observations and simulations can permit us to disentangle the contribution of different physical processes occurring in the icm plasma .    in this section",
    "we investigate the properties of an mhd cluster ( previously reported in @xcite ) and compare some of the properties with a3667 .",
    "it should be noted that this simulated cluster was never meant to represent a3667 .",
    "although there are differences between this cluster and a3667 , there are also some striking similarities .",
    "the simulated cluster was run using a modified version of the _ enzo _ cosmology code @xcite .",
    "_ enzo _ uses block - structured amr @xcite .",
    "the details of the simulation procedure for this cluster have been reported in @xcite which is the same as cluster u1 in @xcite . here , we summarize some major aspects of the simulation and then compare the simulated cluster with observations .    in this simulation , clusters were formed from cosmological initial conditions , generated at redshift @xmath57 from an @xcite power spectrum of density fluctuations in a @xmath58cdm universe .",
    "the amr criteria in this simulation are the same as in @xcite . in order to identify the shocks which ultimately accelerate the electrons that emit synchrotron radiation , the 3-dimensional shock - finder",
    "was used [ as mentioned in section  [ sec : sf ] and @xcite ] .",
    "a minimum pre - shock temperature of @xmath59  k was set since the low - density gas in the cosmological simulations is assumed to be ionized ( a reasonable assumption at z < 6 ) .",
    "therefore , any time the pre - shock temperature is lower than @xmath60  k , the mach number is calculated from the ratio of the post - shock temperature to @xmath60  k. the 3-dimensional shock - finder , already discussed in detail and validated @xcite , has been implemented to run `` on - the - fly '' in ` enzo `   and has the unique ability to accurately identify off - axis shocks within amr simulations and quantify their mach number even if the shock is identified as being spread out across several cells .    in order to estimate the synchrotron emission from the shock waves , the method of @xcite as adapted in @xcite",
    "is followed .",
    "the electrons are assumed to be accelerated to a power - law distribution that is related to the mach number from diffusive shock acceleration or dsa @xcite theory in the test - particle limit .",
    "these accelerated electrons form an extension to the thermal , maxwellian distribution that has a power - law form and exponential cutoff related to balancing the acceleration and cooling times of the electrons .",
    "the accelerated electrons then emit in the radio through synchrotron radiation . in order to estimate the radio synchrotron emission ,",
    "the magnetic fields generated in the simulations are directly used @xcite .",

    ". this simulation models the evolution of dark matter , baryonic matter , and magnetic fields self - consistently .",
    "the simulation uses an adiabatic equation of state for gas , with the ratio of specific heat being @xmath66 , and does not include photoionization / heating or radiative cooling physics or star / galaxy feedback .    figure  [ fig : simxt](a ) shows the projected x - ray emission which is calculated using bremsstrahlung and free - free emission from the cloudy code to integrate the emission from 0.5 - 12.0 kev with a metallicity of @xmath67 .",
    "the radio emission from this cluster ( figure  [ fig : simxt_wvt](a ) ) shows a double - relic system .",
    "the primary cluster is moving from the north - west to the south - east while the secondary cluster mainly to the east .",

    "it should be noted that this simulation is only meant to be illustrative of the processes in a major merger and not reproduce the exact scenario in a3667 .",
    "after the core passage , the merger shock develops and moves out in both directions towards north - west and south - east .",
    "the double - relic feature is aligned well with the central x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray emission ( figure  [ fig : simxt](a ) ) is also elongated along the merger axis showing its un - relaxed nature .",
    "the projected temperature ( figure  [ fig : simxt](b ) ) is not centrally peaked as the x - ray surface brightness ( a strong function of the density ) .",
    "the projected size of the simulated mhd cluster between the two relic positions is about @xmath68  mpc , which is very close to the separation of the observed double relics in a3667 .",
    "here we compare the simulated mhd cluster with the broad features in the a3667 x - ray data . in order to compare the simulated cluster properties with that of the x - ray observations of a3667",
    ", we use the wvt binning technique on the simulated cluster ( same as in section  [ sec : wvt ] ) .",
    "the simulated cluster has much higher dynamic - range in x - ray surface brightness than the observations of a3667 .",
    "hence , we choose an appropriate cut in the x - ray surface brightness and converted that to x - ray counts .",
    "the x - ray counts were scaled according to the count profile of a3667 such that it represents the similar detector properties as in real _ chandra _ observations .",
    "since there are no background files ( as in real observations ) , we apply the wvt - binning to the signal map only with a snr of 50 .",
    "it should be noted that the same threshold was applied to the a3667 data in sections  [ sec : wvt ] and [ sec : acb ] . in this case , the noise map is just the poisson noise from the simulated counts map .",
    "the wvt region map is used to bin the surface brightness and temperature map and then adaptively smooth them using _ asmooth _ ( as in section  [ sec : wvt ] ) .",

    "the 2-dimensional shock - finder does not find mach numbers as high as those detected by the 3-dimensional shock - finder at some pixel locations near the relic as well as near the outskirts .",
    "in addition , the shock structure ( near the radio - relics ) for the 2-dimensional shock - finder appears wider than that for 3-dimensional shock - finder .",
    "this can be attributed to the wvt binning that was applied to the projected x - ray surface brightness and temperature maps before applying the 2-dimensional shock - finder on these two maps .",

    "we use previous radio observations by @xcite to calculate the shock mach numbers from the region around the radio relics and then compare the combined x - ray / radio estimates of the mach number distribution with that from the simulated mhd cluster .",
    "over the past decade , sensitive radio observations have increased our knowledge of the properties of the non - thermal components of the icm .",

    "the spectral index map is similar to the one reported in @xcite . in this map ,",
    "the north - west relic is clearly visible but not the south - east counterpart .",
    "this is due to the fact that the 13 cm observations from the atca has the south - east relic at the very edge of the image which is also dominated by high rms noise .",
    "since the region around the south - east relic has a very low signal - to - noise ratio in the higher frequency map , it is not significant in the spectral index map .",

    "the theory of diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) for planar shocks , at the linear test - particle regime , predicts that this radio spectral index is related to the shock mach number by @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath76 is the radio spectral index ( @xmath81 ) . following the above equation we have constructed the mach number map for the radio data shown in figure [ fig : arad ] ( b ) .",

    "previous studies of a3667 with xmm - newton @xcite derived the mach number near the relic to be @xmath83 .",

    "if the relic is viewed `` face - on '' the radio spectral index is sensitive to cumulative spectral index ( @xmath84 ) due to emission from electrons over the entire lifetime .",
    "hence , the corresponding mach number is given by @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "although the relic in a3667 is viewed `` edge - on '' , the exact estimate of the outer edge of the radio - relic ( or the leading edge of the shock front ) can only be estimated with respect to the dynamic range in the radio images .",
    "hence , there is a possibility that our mach number map ( figure [ fig : arad ] ( b ) ) includes some aged electron population . here",
    ", we also estimate the mach number derived from the integrated spectral index at the radio - relic location of a3667 .",

    ", we extend the validation of the 2-dimensional shock - finder by comparing the mach number distribution calculated from the wvt - binned projected temperature maps of the simulated mhd cluster ( figure  [ fig : simpm_wvt](b ) ) with the original 3-dimensional shock - finder that is used in the cosmological simulations .",
    "then we will proceed to compare the observational shock - finder results on the a3667 x - ray and the mach number distribution from the radio data with the 3-dimensional shock - finder results from the simulated mhd cluster . in order to guide the reader through the interpretation in this section",
    ", we refer to figure  [ fig : machhist ] which summarizes all the relevant results to be discussed in this section .",
    "since the a3667 x - ray data do not extend near the location of the double radio relics , we have used two mach number distributions from the 3-dimensional shock - finder : a ) _ sim-1mpc _ curve  for the inner @xmath13  mpc region of the mhd cluster ( red line in figure  [ fig : machhist ] ) and b ) _",
    "sim-4mpc _ curve  including the entire mhd cluster of @xmath88  mpc size ( green line in figure  [ fig : machhist ] ) including the double radio relics .",
    "the mach number values in the _ sim-1mpc _ curve only extends to @xmath89 .",

    "the _ sim-4mpc _",
    "curve includes the outskirts of the cluster and traces shocks with higher mach number @xmath90 , same as in figure  [ fig : simpm_wvt](a ) .",
    "it should be noted that results from the 3-dimensional shock - finder do not suffer from the projection effects and can find shocks with higher mach number than the observational shock - finder which operates on the 2-dimensional projected surface brightness and temperature maps .",

    "we should note that different mach number distributions shown in figure  [ fig : machhist ] are normalized with the _ sim - wvt _ curve at mach number value of 1.5 . due to this normalization",
    "the agreement between the slopes of different mach number distribution is more pronounced in the region above mach of 1.5 .",
    "hence , the region below mach of 1.5 is shaded in the figure  [ fig : machhist ] and we have less confidence in distributions for these mach numbers .",
    "the slope of the mach number distribution ( in black ) matches with the _ sim-4mpc _ curve .",
    "however , the mach number values in _ sim - wvt _ curve are restricted to @xmath91",
    ". this can be due to two reasons .",
    "firstly , in section  [ sec : sim ] we have used an appropriate cut on the x - ray surface brightness of the simulated cluster in order to compare with a3667 x - ray results .",
    "this cut has restricted the field - of - view of the simulated mhd cluster to only the regions @xmath92  mpc from the center of the cluster .",
    "hence , the _ sim-4mpc _ curve may include regions at larger radii from the center of the cluster than in the _ sim - wvt _ curve .",
    "secondly , the _ sim - wvt _ curve also suffers from projection effects , which can make strong shocks to appear weaker . considering the above two limitations",
    ", we can infer that the results from the 3-dimensional shock - finder are in agreement with that of the observational shock - finder and successfully validates the latter .",
    "we now proceed to compare the _",
    "sim-1mpc _ curve with the results of the observational shock - finder on a3667 x - ray data .",
    "a3667-x _ curve ( blue line in figure  [ fig : machhist ] ) corresponds to the mach number distribution from the observational shock - finder when applied on the x - ray surface brightness and acb temperature map of a3667 ( figure  [ fig : atemp_acb](a ) ) .",
    "it is relevant to note here that the combined _ chandra _ observations of a3667 are only limited to the central @xmath13  mpc from the center of the cluster and do not extend to the location of the double radio relics .",
    "this is similar to the case of _",

    "also , the slopes of both these distributions match very well considering the fact that the _ a3667-x _ curve is influenced by the binning with acb circles ( shown in figure  [ fig : atemp_acb](b ) ) .",
    "now , we include the a3667 radio data which extends to the location of the double relics ( figure  [ fig : rgb](a ) ) and traces shocks at the outskirts of the a3667 cluster ( @xmath14  mpc from the center of the cluster ) .",

    "firstly , we can conclude that the shocks in a real observed galaxy cluster like a3667 can be reproduced in the current state - of - the - art mhd amr simulations [ e.g. @xcite ] due to accurate modeling of the physical processes in the icm .",
    "secondly , we have demonstrated the need to combine the observations at x - ray and radio wavelengths to analyze the shocks in a galaxy cluster ( like a3667 ) accurately .",

    "hence , we advise to run the wvt temperature map first in order to find the appropriate snr value and then proceed with the acb method .",

    "<S> these suggest multiple merger events in this cluster . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we analyze the substantial archival x - ray observations of abell 3667 from _ chandra _ x - ray observatory and compare these with existing radio observations as well as state - of - the - art amr ( adaptive mesh refinement ) mhd cosmological simulations using ` enzo ` . </S>",
    "<S> we have used two temperature map making techniques , weighted voronoi tessellation and adaptive circular binning , to produce the high resolution and largest field - of - view temperature maps of abell 3667 . </S>",
    "<S> these high fidelity temperature maps allow us to study the x - ray shocks in the cluster using a new 2-dimensional shock - finding algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we have also estimated the mach numbers from the shocks inferred from previous atca radio observations . </S>",
    "<S> the combined shock statistics from the x - ray and radio data are in agreement with the shock statistics in a simulated mhd cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we have also studied the profiles of the thermodynamic properties across the cold front using @xmath0  ksec from the combined _ chandra _ observations on abell 3667 . </S>",
    "<S> our results show that the stability of the cold front in abell 3667 can be attributed to the suppression of the thermal conduction across the cold front by a factor of @xmath1 compared to the classical spitzer value . </S>"
