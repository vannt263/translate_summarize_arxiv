    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) are unique probes of galactic chemical and dynamical evolution . but before they can be used , they must be found , and the best way of doing this involves searching for pn candidates via their bright [ o  iii ] @xmath0 emission . as a result",
    ", the first piece of information obtained about a set of extragalactic pne is their [ o  iii ] @xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "since this luminosity function contains information about both distance and parent population , one should make every effort to understand its properties and features .",
    "although the idea of using pne as extragalactic distance indicators was first suggested the early 1960 s @xcite , it was not until the late 1970 s that a pn - based distance estimate was made @xcite , and the first study of the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity function ( pnlf ) was not performed until 1989 @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is an irony of the subject that pn distance measurements inside the local group @xcite were made only after the technique had been applied to more distant systems @xcite , and the first application of the pnlf inside the milky way @xcite occurred after the method had been used to estimate the hubble constant @xcite .",
    "this odd chronology , of course , was due to the fact that individual pne are definitely not standard candles @xcite , and that distance estimates to galactic pne are extremely poor .",
    "nevertheless , today the [ o  iii ] @xmath0 pnlf is one of the most important standard candles in extragalactic astronomy , and the only method that can be applied to all the large galaxies of the local supercluster , regardless of environment or hubble type ( see fig .",
    "[ eps1 ] ) .",
    "the use of the pn luminosity function is extremely simple .",
    "one surveys a distant galaxy or cluster and identifies point sources that are present in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 but completely invisible in the continuum .",
    "these are the planetary nebula candidates .",
    "unfortunately , mixed in with the pne are three types of contaminants :    _ h  ii regions : _ star formation is not an issue in most elliptical and lenticular galaxies , but in late - type systems , the h  ii regions around o and b stars will far outnumber the pne .",
    "fortunately , most h  ii regions are resolvable under good seeing ( @xmath2 ) conditions , and their exciting stars may be visible on deep continuum images .",
    "this contrasts with pne which ( in galaxies more distant than the magellanic clouds ) are always stellar and have invisible central stars .",
    "moreover , observations in m31 s bulge , m33 s disk , and the lmc have shown that all planetaries in the top @xmath3  mag of the pnlf have [ o  iii ] @xmath0 to h@xmath4+[n  ii ] line ratios greater than @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "most h  ii regions have h@xmath4 brighter than [ o  iii ] @xcite .    _",
    "supernova remnants : _ unresolved high - excitation supernova remnants can masquerade as planetary nebulae , especially in galaxies that have a cold , high - density interstellar medium . because compact supernova remnants are rare",
    ", their effect on the pnlf is minimal .",
    "nevertheless , one needs to be aware of this source of contamination , especially at the bright limit of the luminosity function .",
    "any single object that appears overluminous in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 could be the result of a supernova explosion .",
    "_ ly@xmath4 galaxies : _ at @xmath6 , ly@xmath4 is redshifted to 5007   , and at fluxes below @xmath7  ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 , unresolved and marginally resolved high - redshift galaxies with extremely strong ly@xmath4 emission ( equivalent widths @xmath10    in the observers frame ) can mimic planetary nebulae @xcite . since the surface density of these starbursting objects is relatively low , @xmath3  arcmin@xmath11  per unit redshift interval brighter than @xmath12  ergs  @xmath8  s@xmath9 @xcite , pn surveys in galaxies are not strongly affected by this contaminant .",
    "however , in the intracluster environment of systems such as virgo and fornax , ly@xmath4 galaxies are the predominant source of error , and they limit the effectiveness of any luminosity function analysis . to identify these interlopers , one must either obtain deep broadband images ( to detect the underlying continuum of the galaxies ) or perform spectroscopy ( to test for the existence of [ o  iii ] @xmath13 or resolve the @xmath14  km  s@xmath9 width of the ly@xmath4 line ) .",
    "once the pne are found , all one needs to do to determine a distance is to measure their monochromatic [ o  iii ] @xmath0 fluxes , define a statistical sample of objects , and fit the observed luminosity function to some standard law . for simplicity ,",
    "et  al .  _",
    "@xcite have described the pnlf via a truncated exponential @xmath15 where @xmath16 though other forms of the relation are possible @xcite . in the above equation ,",
    "the key parameter is @xmath17 , the absolute magnitude of the brightest planetary .",
    "despite some efforts at galactic calibrations @xcite , the pnlf remains a secondary standard candle .",
    "the original value for the zero point , @xmath18 , was based on an m31 infrared cepheid distance of 710  kpc @xcite and a foreground extinction of @xmath19 @xcite . since then",
    ", m31 s distance has increased @xcite , its reddening has decreased @xcite , and , most importantly , the cepheid distances to 12 additional galaxies have been included in the calibration @xcite .",
    "somewhat fortuitously , the current value of @xmath17 is only 0.01  mag fainter than the original value , @xmath20 .",
    "note that all pnlf distances require some estimate of the foreground interstellar extinction .",
    "there are two sources to consider .",
    "the first , extinction in the milky way , is readily available from reddening maps derived from h  i measurements and galaxy counts @xcite and/or from the dirbe and iras satellite experiments @xcite .",
    "the second , internal extinction in the host galaxy , is only a problem in late - type spiral and irregular galaxies .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to quantify . in the galaxy , the scale height of pne",
    "is significantly larger than that of the dust @xcite .",
    "if the same is true in other galaxies , then we would expect the bright end of the pnlf to always be dominated by objects foreground to the dust layer .",
    "this conclusion seems to be supported by observational data @xcite and numerical models @xcite , both of which suggest that the internal extinction which affects a galaxy s pn population is @xmath21  mag",
    ". we will revisit this issue in section  3 .",
    "in the past decade , the pnlf has been subjected to a number of rigorous tests .",
    "these tests fall into four categories .",
    "five galaxies have large enough pn samples to test for radial gradients in the location of the pnlf cutoff .",
    "two are large - bulge sb spirals ( m31 @xcite and m81 @xcite ) , one is a pure - disk sc spiral with a strong metallicity gradient ( m33 @xcite ) , one is large elliptical galaxy ( ngc  4494 @xcite ) , and one is a blue , interacting peculiar elliptical ( ngc  5128 @xcite ) .",
    "no significant change in the pnlf has been seen in _ any _ of these systems .",
    "given the diversity of the stellar populations sampled in these systems , this result , in itself , is impressive proof of the robustness of the method .      to date , six galaxy clusters have multiple pnlf measurements : the m81 group ( m81 and ngc  2403 @xcite ) , the ngc  1023 group ( ngc  891 and 1023 @xcite ) , the ngc  5128 group ( ngc  5102 , 5128 , and 5253 @xcite ) , the fornax cluster ( ngc  1316 , 1380 , 1399 , and 1404 @xcite ) , the leo  i group ( ngc  3351 , 3368 , 3377 , 3379 , and 3384 @xcite ) , and the virgo cluster ( ngc  4374 , 4382 , 4406 , 4472 , 4486 , and 4649 @xcite ) . in each system , the observed galaxies have a range of color , absolute magnitude , and hubble type . despite these differences ,",
    "no discrepant distances have been found , as the galaxies of each group always fall within @xmath3  mpc of each other .",
    "indeed , the pnlf measurements in virgo easily resolve the infalling m84/m86 group , which is background to the main body of the cluster @xcite .      because planetary nebulae are found in all types of galaxies , it is possible to compare the results of the pnlf method directly with distances derived from all of the other techniques at the top of the distance ladder .",
    "the most instructive of these comparisons involve cepheid variables and the surface brightness fluctuation ( sbf ) method .",
    "figure  [ eps2 ] compares the pnlf distances of 13 galaxies ( derived using the foreground extinction estimates from dirbe / iras @xcite ) with the final cepheid distances produced by the _",
    "hst key project _ @xcite .",
    "neither dataset has been corrected for the effects of metallicity . since the absolute magnitude of the pnlf cutoff , @xmath17 ,",
    "is calibrated via these cepheid distances , the weighted mean of the distribution must , by definition , be zero . however , the scatter about this mean , and the systematic trends in the data , are valid indicators of the reliability of the technique .",
    "as fig .  [ eps2 ] illustrates , the scatter between the cepheid and pnlf distances is impressively small . except for the most metal - poor systems , the residuals are perfectly consistent with the internal uncertainties of the methods .",
    "moreover , the systematic shift seen at low - metallicity is exactly that predicted by models of post - agb evolution @xcite .",
    "there is little room for any additional metallicity term , either in the cepheid or pnlf relations .",
    "figure  [ eps3 ] compares the pnlf distances of 29 galaxies with distances derived from sbf measurements .",
    "as is illustrated , the relative distances of the two methods are in excellent agreement : the scatter in the data is exactly that predicted from the internal errors of the measurements . however , the absolute distance scale derived from the sbf data is @xmath22  mag larger than that inferred from the pnlf .",
    "since both techniques are calibrated via cepheid measurements , and both have formal zero - point uncertainties of @xmath23  mag , this type of offset should not exist .    ) and ngc  891 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "the curve represents the expected dispersion of the data .",
    "the figure demonstrates that the absolute scales of the two techniques are discrepant by @xmath22  mag , but the internal and external errors of the methods agree.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    the most likely cause of the discrepancy is a small amount of internal extinction in the cepheid calibration galaxies . for most methods ( including the pnlf ) ,",
    "an underestimate of extinction produces an underestimate of luminosity . as a result , undetected internal extinction within a cepheid calibration galaxy propagates into an underestimate of the standard candle s brightness , and an extragalactic distance scale that is too small . for the sbf technique , however , the opposite is true .",
    "the sbf standard candle , @xmath25 , is extremely sensitive to color , i.e. ,  @xmath26\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "if internal extinction exists in an sbf calibrator , the galaxy s underlying population will appear too red , and the inferred value of @xmath25 will be too bright .",
    "the result will be a set of distances that are systematically too large .    if internal extinction really is responsible for the offset displayed in fig",
    ".  [ eps3 ] , then the zero points of both systems must be adjusted .",
    "these corrections propagate all the way up the distance ladder .",
    "for example , according to the _ hst key project , _ the sbf - based hubble constant is @xmath27 ( random ) @xmath28 ( systematic ) km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 @xcite . however , if we assume that the calibration galaxies are internally reddened by @xmath29 , then the zero point of the sbf system fades by 0.17  mag , and the sbf hubble constant increases to 75  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "this one correction is as large as the technique s entire systematic error budget .",
    "such an error could not have been found without the cross - check provided by pnlf measurements .",
    "two galaxies have distance measurements that do not depend on the distance ladder .",
    "the first is ngc  4258 , which has a resolved disk of cold gas orbiting its central black hole .",
    "the proper motions and radial accelerations of water masers associated with this gas yield an unambiguous geometric distance of @xmath30  mpc @xcite .",
    "the second benchmark comes from the light echo of sn  1987a in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "although the geometry of the light echo is still somewhat controversial , the most detailed and complete analysis of the object to date gives a distance of @xmath31  kpc @xcite . in table  1",
    "we compare these values with the distances determined from the pnlf @xcite and from cepheids @xcite .",
    "lccc method & lmc & ngc  4258 & @xmath32 ( mag ) + geometry & @xmath33 & @xmath34 & @xmath35 + cepheids & 18.50 & @xmath36 & @xmath37 + pnlf & @xmath38 & @xmath39 & @xmath40 +    [ tab1 ]    as the table demonstrates , the cepheid and pnlf methods both overestimate the distance to ngc  4258 by @xmath41  mag , i.e. ,  by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . in the absence of some systematic error affecting both methods ,",
    "the probability of this happening is @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    ", there is no disagreement concerning ngc  4258 s distance _ relative to that of the lmc : _ the cepheids , pnlf , and geometric techniques all agree to within @xmath45 ! such a small error is probably fortuitous , but it does suggest the presence of a systematic error that affects the entire extragalactic distance ladder .",
    "in fact , the _ hst key project _",
    "distances are all based on an lmc distance modulus of @xmath46 @xcite , and , via the data of fig .",
    "[ eps2 ] , the pnlf distance scale is tied to that of the cepheids .",
    "if the zero point of the cepheid scale were shifted to @xmath47 , then all the measurements would be in agreement .",
    "this consistency supports a shorter distance to the lmc , and argues for a 7% increase in the _ hst key project _",
    "hubble constant to 77  km  s@xmath9  mpc@xmath9 .",
    "the fact that the pnlf method is insensitive to metallicity is not a surprise .",
    "since oxygen is a primary nebular coolant , any decrease in its abundance raises the plasma s electron temperature and increases the rate of collisional excitations per ion .",
    "this mitigates the effect of having fewer emitting ions in the nebula , so that a decrease in oxygen abundance only lessens the emergent [ o  iii ] @xmath0 line flux by ( roughly ) the square root of the abundance difference @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the pn s core reacts to metallicity in the opposite manner .",
    "if the metallicity of the progenitor star is decreased , then the pn s central star will be slightly more massive and its emergent uv flux will be slightly greater @xcite .",
    "this additional energy almost exactly compensates for the decreased emissivity of the nebula . as a result ,",
    "the total [ o  iii ] @xmath0 flux that is generated by a planetary is virtually independent of metallicity .",
    "this fortuitous cancellation has been confirmed by more detailed models of pn evolution : only in the most metal - poor systems does the brightness of the pnlf cutoff fade by more than a few percent @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 planetary nebula luminosity functions of of three local group stellar populations .",
    "old populations , such as that found in the bulge of m31 , have an exponentially increasing pnlf .",
    "in contrast , the pnlfs of star - forming systems are non - monotonic , with a `` dip '' that begins @xmath48  mag below @xmath17 .",
    "the location of this dip is consistent with models in which the luminosity evolution of planetary nebulae is governed by the rapid evolution of high - mass central stars .",
    ", scaledwidth=96.0% ]    the insensitivity of the pnlf cutoff to population age is more difficult to understand . a pn s [ o  iii ]",
    "@xmath0 flux is directly proportional to the luminosity of its central star , and this luminosity , in turn , is extremely sensitive to central star mass @xcite .",
    "since central star mass is directly proportional to progenitor mass via the initial mass - final mass relation @xcite , one would think that the pnlf cutoff would fade dramatically with time @xcite .",
    "yet observations demonstrate that this fading does not occur .",
    "although we do not as yet have a complete theory for the age - invariance of the pnlf , a few clues are beginning to emerge .",
    "the first concerns the faint end of the luminosity function .",
    "although the location of the pnlf cutoff does not change with stellar population , the same is not true for the function s overall shape . as fig .",
    "[ eps4 ] demonstrates , old populations , such as m31 s bulge , have a pnlf that increases exponentially following @xmath49 .",
    "this type of behavior is expected if the pne of these systems have low - mass cores , so that the timescale for central star evolution is much longer than that for nebular expansion @xcite .",
    "in contrast , star - forming galaxies have a `` dip '' in the pnlf at magnitudes between @xmath48 and @xmath50  mag down from @xmath17 .",
    "this deficit is a natural characteristic of models in which the evolution of [ o  iii ] @xmath0 is governed by the rapid evolution of a high - mass core . in such systems ,",
    "the non - monotonic pnlf is simply a reflection of the bimodal luminosity function expected from post - agb stars @xcite .",
    "a second clue to the pnlf comes from the fortuitous correlation between the maximum uv emission achieved by a pn central star and the mass of its envelope .",
    "high luminosity pn cores have large circumstellar envelopes , and , consequently , large amounts of circumstellar dust .",
    "the extinction caused by this dust can act to regulate the amount of [ o  iii ] @xmath0 flux generated by a planetary , so that the luminosity of high core - mass objects never exceeds @xmath17 .",
    "support for this scenario comes from the fact that nine magellanic cloud planetaries have intrinsic [ o  iii ] @xmath0 magnitudes brighter than @xmath17 , but _ all _ are self - extincted below the pnlf cutoff @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is observational evidence for a correlation between the amount of pn circumstellar extinction and central star mass for young , [ o  iii]-bright objects @xcite .",
    "the final constraint on the physics of the pnlf comes from the number of pn produced by different stellar populations . according to the theory of stellar energy generation @xcite , all populations older than @xmath3  gyr create @xmath3  pn per year per @xmath51 ( bolometric ) . if this is true , then",
    "measurements of the luminosity - specific number of pne present in a galaxy can be immediately translated into constraints on the lifetime of an [ o  iii]-bright nebula and on the fraction of stars which go through the bright planetary nebula phase .",
    "this constraint is given in fig .",
    "[ eps5 ] . for small and medium - sized galaxies ,",
    "pne typically spend @xmath52  yr within @xmath3  mag of @xmath17 . however , the apparent pn timescale decreases dramatically for objects in giant elliptical and lenticular galaxies .",
    "either the [ o  iii]-bright planetaries in these systems have much shorter lives than their small - galaxy counterparts , or a substantial fraction of the stars of giant ellipticals do not evolve into these types of objects .",
    "@xmath0 pnlf plotted as a function of galactic absolute @xmath53 magnitude .",
    "the right side of the @xmath54-axis translates this number into a constraint on the pn lifetime using a luminosity - specific stellar evolutionary flux of @xmath55  stars  yr@xmath56 .",
    "either the [ o  iii]-bright pne of giant ellipticals live very short lives , or a substantial fraction of the stars in these galaxies do not contribute to the bright - end of the pnlf.,scaledwidth=96.0% ]",
    "of course , attempting to derive the evolution of ensembles of planetary nebulae from [ o  iii ] data alone is like trying to infer the evolution of star clusters from photometry performed through only one filter . in order to gain a fuller understanding of the global properties of planetary nebulae",
    ", one must study the luminosity function of pne in a multi - dimensional emission - line space .",
    "the data for such a study are just now beginning to be available .",
    "narrow - band photometric surveys are yielding information on the absolute line strengths of pne in [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and h@xmath4+[n  ii ] for a variety of stellar populations .",
    "follow - up radial velocity surveys are then producing data on h@xmath57 relative to [ o  iii ] @xmath0 and , in some cases , [ n  ii ] and [ s  ii ] relative to h@xmath4 . by comparing these measurements to models , we should be able to gain a much more complete understanding of planetary nebula phenomenon .",
