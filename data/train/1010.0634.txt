    "spin - glass behavior in an applied magnetic field @xmath11 has been studied .",
    "more specifically , i have numerically probed a site - diluted ising dipole model of magnetic dipoles for the existence of an almeida - thouless phase - boundary line .",
    "this did model has been previously shown@xcite to have , in three dimensions , at @xmath14 and low temperatures , ( i ) an af phase for @xmath185 , where @xmath186 , ( ii ) a ( marginal ) sg phase for @xmath187 , that is @xmath188 , ( iii ) a behavior for @xmath189 that is independent of lattice structure and depends on @xmath43 and @xmath10 only through @xmath32 , and ( iv ) @xmath190 .",
    "spin - glass behavior as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath11 can therefore be inferred for all @xmath189 from that at a single small value of @xmath43 .    here ,",
    "equilibrium results , from tempered monte carlo simulations , are reported for @xmath131 and @xmath149 for the did model at @xmath29 , various temperatures and system sizes , at @xmath14 and @xmath130 .",
    "the criterion for the existence of an at line , that @xmath131 and @xmath149 be independent of @xmath34 at the critical point , has been shown here to work well for ( i ) the sk model at @xmath14 and @xmath118 , that is , @xmath191 , for which the answer has long been known,@xcite as well as ( ii ) for the did model at @xmath14 . for @xmath130 , that is , @xmath192 , the trend observed in the data is clearly away from @xmath131 or @xmath149 becoming independent of @xmath34 at any @xmath10 as @xmath31 .",
    "indeed , @xmath45 saturates to a finite value beyond @xmath193 for all @xmath10 .",
    "all of this is consistent with the absence of an at phase boundary line in the did model , at least above @xmath194 .",
