    "in recent years there has been an explosion of interest in exploitation of quantum mechanical systems as a basis for new quantum technologies , giving birth to the field of quantum information science . to develop quantum technologies",
    ", it has been recognized from early on that quantum control systems will play a crucial role for tasks such as manipulating a quantum mechanical system to perform a desired function or to protect it from external disturbances @xcite .",
    "moreover , recent advances in quantum and nanotechnology have provided a great impetus for research in the area of quantum feedback control systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "= -1perhaps just about the simplest and most tractable controller to design would be the linear quantum controllers , and this makes them an especially attractive class of controllers . in this class",
    ", one can have classical linear quantum controllers that process only classical signals which are obtained from a quantum plant by measurement of some plant output signals ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but more recently there has also been interest in fully quantum and mixed quantum - classical linear controllers that are able to manipulate quantum signals @xcite . in fact , an experimental realization of a fully quantum controller in quantum optics has been successfully demonstrated in @xcite . as noted in that paper , the class of fully quantum controllers or _ coherent - feedback controllers _ , as they are often known in the physics literature , presents genuinely new control - theoretic challenges for quantum controller design .",
    "an important open problem raised in the works @xcite is how one would systematically build or implement a general , arbitrarily complex , linear quantum controller , at least approximately , from basic quantum devices , such as quantum optical devices .",
    "this problem can be viewed as a quantum analogue of the synthesis problem of classical electrical networks ( in this paper the qualifier `` classical '' refers broadly to systems that are not quantum mechanical ) that asks the question of how to build arbitrarily complex linear electrical circuits from elementary passive and active electrical components such as resistors , capacitors , inductors , transistors , op - amps , etc .",
    "therefore , the quantum synthesis problem is not only of interest for the construction of linear quantum stochastic controllers , but also more broadly as a fundamental aspect of linear quantum circuit theory that arises , for example , in quantum optics and when working with phenomenological models of quantum rlc circuits such as described in @xcite , as well as in relatively new fields such as nanomechanical circuit quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "a key result of this paper is a new synthesis theorem ( theorem [ th : synthesis ] ) that prescribes how an arbitrarily complex linear quantum stochastic system can be decomposed into an interconnection of basic building blocks of one degree of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillators and thus be systematically constructed from these building blocks . in the context of quantum optics , we then propose physical schemes for `` wiring up ''",
    "one degree of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillators and the interconnections between them that are required to build a desired linear quantum stochastic system , using basic quantum optical components such as optical cavities , beam splitters , squeezers , etc .",
    "an explicit yet simple example that illustrates the application of the theorem to the synthesis of a two degrees of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillator is provided .      to motivate synthesis theory in the context of linear dynamical quantum systems",
    ", we start with a brief overview of aspects of linear electrical network synthesis that are relevant for the current work .    as is well known , a classical ( continuous time , causal , linear time invariant ) electrical network described by a set of ( coupled ) ordinary differential equations can be analyzed using various representations , for example , with a frequency domain or transfer function representation , with a modern state space representation and , more recently , with a behavioral representation .",
    "it is well known that the transfer function and state space representation are equivalent in the sense that one can switch between one representation to the other for any given network . however , although one can associate a unique transfer function representation to a state space representation , the converse is not true : for a given transfer function there are infinitely many state space representations .",
    "the state space representation can be made to be unique ( up to a similarity transformation of the state space matrices ) by requiring that the representation be of minimal order ( i.e. , the representation is both controllable and observable ) .",
    "the synthesis question in linear electrical networks theory deals with the inverse scenario , where one is presented with a transfer function or state space description of a linear system and would like to synthesize or build such a system from various linear electrical components such as resistors , capacitors , inductors , op - amps , etc .",
    "a particularly advantageous feature of the state space representation , since it is given by a set of first order ordinary differential equations , is that it can be inferred directly from the representation how the system can be _ systematically _ synthesized .",
    "for example , consider the system below , given in a state space representation : @xmath0x(t)+ \\left[\\begin{array}{c } 1\\\\ 0.1 \\end{array}\\right]u(t),\\\\ y(t)&=&\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } 0 & 1 \\end{array}\\right]x(t ) + u(t ) ,   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the state , @xmath2 is the input signal , and @xmath3 is the output signal . in an electrical circuit , @xmath2 could be the voltage at certain input ports of the circuit and @xmath3    ) .[fig : circ - diag ] ]    .[fig : circ - hw ] ]    could be the voltage at another set of ports of the circuit , different from the input ports .",
    "this system can be implemented according to the schematic shown in figure [ fig : circ - diag ] .",
    "this schematic can then be used to to implement the system at the hardware level as shown in figure [ fig : circ - hw ] ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 13 ) . however , linear electrical network synthesis is a mature subject that deals with much more than just how one can obtain _ some _ realization of a particular system .",
    "for instance , it also addresses fundamental issues such as how a passive network , a network that does not require an external source of energy , can also be synthesized using only passive electrical components , and how to synthesize a given circuit with a minimal number of circuit elements or with a minimal number of certain types of elements ( such as active elements ) . in this paper",
    "our primary objective is to develop an analogously systematic method for synthesizing arbitrarily complex linear dynamical _ quantum _ stochastic systems that are given in an abstract description that is similar in form to ( [ eq : ss - eg-1 ] ) .",
    "these linear dynamical quantum stochastic systems are ubiquitous in linear quantum optics , where they arise as idealized models for linear open quantum systems . however , since there is currently no comprehensive synthesis theory available for linear dynamical quantum systems ( as opposed to _",
    "static _ linear quantum systems in linear quantum optics that have been studied in , e.g. , @xcite ) and related notions such as passivity have not been extensively studied and developed , here we focus our attention solely on the development of a _ general _ synthesis method that applies to _ arbitrary _ linear dynamical quantum systems which does not exploit specific physical properties or characteristics that a particular system may possess ( say , for instance , passivity ) .",
    "although the latter will be an important issue to be dealt with in further development of the general theory , it is beyond the scope of the present paper ( which simply demonstrates the existence of _ some _ physical realization ) .",
    "= -1a quantum system is never completely isolated from its environment and can thus interact with it .",
    "such quantum systems are said to be _ open quantum systems _ and are important in modeling various important physical phenomena such as the decay of the energy of an atom . the environment is modeled as a separate quantum system in itself and can be viewed as a _",
    "heat bath _ to which an open quantum system can dissipate energy or from which it can gain energy ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 3 and 7 ) ) .",
    "an idealization often employed in modeling the interaction between an open quantum system and an external heat bath is the introduction of a _",
    "assumption : the dynamics of the coupled system and bath is essentially `` memoryless '' in the sense that future evolution of the dynamics of the coupled system depends only on its present state and not at all on its past states .",
    "open quantum systems with such a property are said to be _",
    "markov_. the markov assumption is approximately valid under some physical assumptions made on the system and bath , such as that the heat bath is so much `` larger '' than the system ( in the sense that it has many more degrees of freedom than the system ) and is weakly coupled to the system that its interaction with the latter has little effect on its own dynamics and can thus be neglected ; for details on the physical basis for this markovian assumption , see ( * ? ? ? * chapters 3 and 5 ) .",
    "markov open quantum systems are important , as they are often employed as very good approximations to various practically relevant open quantum systems , particularly those that are encountered in the field of quantum optics , yet at the same time are relatively more tractable to analyze as their dynamics can be written in terms of first order operator differential equations",
    ".    in markov open quantum systems , heat baths can be idealistically modeled as a collection of a continuum of harmonic oscillators oscillating at frequencies in a continuum of values .",
    "an important consequence of the markov approximation in this model is that the heat bath can be effectively treated in a quantum statistical sense as quantum noise @xcite , and thus markov open quantum systems have inherently stochastic quantum dynamics that are most appropriately described by quantum stochastic differential equations ( qsde ) @xcite . to be concrete , a single heat bath in the markov approximation is formally modeled as an operator - valued _ quantum white noise _",
    "process @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes time , that satisfies the singular commutation relation @xmath6=\\delta(t - t')$ ] , where @xmath7 denotes the adjoint of an operator , @xmath8 is the dirac delta function , and the commutator bracket @xmath9 $ ] acts on operators @xmath10 and @xmath11 as @xmath12=ab - ba$ ] .",
    "examples of heat baths that have been effectively modeled in such a way include vacuum noise , squeezed and laser fields in quantum optics @xcite , and infinitely long bosonic transmission lines @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for a brief intuitive overview of the modeling of a free - traveling quantized electromagnetic wave as quantum white noise .",
    "the formal treatment with quantum white noises can be made mathematically rigorous by considering the bosonic annihilation process @xmath13 ( on a fock space ) that can be formally defined as the `` integral '' of @xmath4 : @xmath14 and its adjoint process @xmath15 .",
    "we shall refer to the operator process @xmath13 simply as a _",
    "bosonic field_. the celebrated hudson  parthasarathy ( h - p ) stochastic calculus provides a framework for working with differential equations involving the processes @xmath13 and @xmath16 , as well as another fundamental process on a fock space called the gauge process , denoted by @xmath17 , that models scattering of the photons of the bosonic heat bath ( at a formal level , one could write @xmath18 ) .",
    "more generally , a quantum system can be coupled to several independent bosonic fields @xmath19 , with @xmath20 , and in this case there can be scattering between different fields modeled by interfield gauge processes @xmath21 ( in interfield scattering , a photon is annihilated in one field and then created in another ) .",
    "linear dynamical quantum stochastic systems ( e.g. , see @xcite ) arise in practice as idealized models of _ open _ quantum harmonic oscillators whose canonical position and momentum operators are _ linearly _ coupled to one or more external ( quantum ) heat baths ( the mathematical modeling involved is discussed in section [ sec : models ] ) . here",
    "a quantum harmonic oscillator is a quantized version of a classical harmonic oscillator in which the classical position and momentum variables @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively , are replaced by operators @xmath24 , @xmath25 on an appropriate hilbert space ( in this case the space @xmath26 ) satisfying the canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) @xmath27=2i$ ] .",
    "it is said to be open if it is interacting with elements of its environment .",
    "for instance , consider the scenario in @xcite of an atom trapped in an optical cavity .",
    "the light in the cavity is strongly coupled to the atomic dipole , and as the atom absorbs and emits light , there are random mechanical forces on the atom . in an appropriate parameter regime , the details of the optical and atomic dipole dynamics are unimportant , and the optical field can be modeled as an environment for the atomic motion . under the assumptions of @xcite the `` motional observables '' of the trapped atom ( its position and momentum operators ) can then be treated like those of an open quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "linear markov open quantum models are extensively employed in various branches of physics in which the markov type of arguments and approximations such as discussed in the preceding subsection can be justified .",
    "they are particularly prominent in quantum optics , but have also been used , among others , in phenomenological modeling of quantum rlc circuits @xcite , in which the dissipative heat baths are realized by infinitely long transmission lines attached to a circuit . for this reason , the general synthesis results developed herein ( cf .",
    "theorem [ th : synthesis ] ) are anticipated to be be relevant in various branches of quantum physics that employ linear markov models .",
    "for example , it has the potential of playing an important role in the systematic and practical design of complex linear photonic circuits as the technology becomes feasible .",
    "a general linear dynamical quantum stochastic system is simply a many degrees of freedom open quantum harmonic oscillator with several pairs of canonical position and momentum operators @xmath28 , with @xmath29 ranging from 1 to @xmath30 , where @xmath30 is the number of degrees of freedom of the system , satisfying the ( many degrees of freedom ) ccr @xmath31=2i\\delta_{jk}$ ] and @xmath32=[p_j , p_k]=0 $ ] , where @xmath33 is the kronecker delta which takes on the value @xmath34 unless @xmath35 , in which case it takes on the value 1 , that is linearly coupled to a number of external bosonic fields @xmath36 . in the interaction picture with respect to the field and oscillator dynamics , the operators @xmath37 evolve unitarily in time as @xmath38 while preserving the ccr @xmath39=2i\\delta_{jk}$ ] and @xmath40=[p_j(t),p_k(t)]=0 $ ] @xmath41 , and the dynamics of the oscillator is given by ( here @xmath42 and @xmath43 ) @xmath44,\\nonumber\\\\ dy(t)&=&c x(t ) dt + d da(t ) , \\label{eq : q - ss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 . here",
    "the variable @xmath3 acts as the output of the system due to interaction of the bosonic fields with the oscillator ; a component @xmath49 of @xmath3 is the transformed version of the field @xmath50 that results _ after _ it interacts with the oscillator .",
    "hence , @xmath50 can be viewed as an _ incoming _ or _ input _ field , while @xmath49 is the corresponding _ outgoing _ or _ output _ field . to make the discussion more concrete ,",
    "let us consider a well - known example of a linear quantum stochastic system in quantum optics : an optical cavity ( see section [ sec : opt - cav ] for further details of this device ) , shown in figure [ fig : fabry - perot ] .",
    "the cavity depicted in the picture is known as a standing    ]    wave or fabry  perot cavity and consists of one fully reflecting mirror at the cavity resonance frequency and one partially transmitting mirror .",
    "light that is trapped inside the cavity forms a standing wave with an oscillation frequency of @xmath51 , while parts of it leak through the partially transmitting mirror .",
    "the loss of light through this mirror is modeled as an interaction between the cavity with an incoming bosonic field @xmath13 in the vacuum state ( i.e. , a field with zero photons or a zero - point field ) incident on the mirror .",
    "the dynamics for a cavity is linear and given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the coupling coefficient of the mirror , @xmath54 are the interaction picture position and momentum operators of the standing wave inside the cavity , and @xmath3 is the outgoing bosonic field that leaks out of the cavity . a crucial point to notice about ( [ eq : q - ss ] ) is that it is in a similar form to the classical deterministic state space representation such as given in ( [ eq : ss - eg-1 ] ) , with the critical exception that ( [ eq : q - ss ] ) is a ( quantum ) stochastic system ( due to the quantum statistical interpretation of @xmath13 ) and involves quantities which are operator - valued rather than real / complex - valued .",
    "furthermore , the system matrices @xmath55 in ( [ eq : q - ss ] ) can not take on arbitrary values for ( [ eq : q - ss ] ) to represent the dynamics of a physically meaningful system ( see @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 7 ) for further details ) .",
    "for instance , for arbitrary choices of @xmath55 the many degrees of freedom ccr may not be satisfied for all @xmath5 as required by quantum mechanics ; hence these matrices can not represent a physically feasible system . in @xcite , the notion of _",
    "physically realizable _ linear quantum stochastic systems has been introduced that corresponds to open quantum harmonic oscillators ( hence are physically meaningful ) , which do not include scattering processes among the bosonic fields . in particular , necessary and sufficient conditions",
    "have been derived on the matrices @xmath55 for a system of the form ( [ eq : q - ss ] ) to be physically realizable . more generally , however , are linear quantum stochastic systems that are completely described and parameterized by three ( operator - valued ) parameters : its hamiltonian @xmath56 ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , its linear coupling operator to the external bosonic fields @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) , and its _ unitary _ scattering matrix @xmath61 .",
    "in particular , when there is no scattering involved ( @xmath62 , then it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath63 can be recovered from @xmath64 ( since @xmath65 , here necessarily @xmath66 ) and vice - versa .",
    "although @xcite does not consider the scattering processes , the methods and results therein can be adapted accordingly to account for these processes ( this is developed in section [ sec : param - corspnds ] of this paper ) .",
    "the works @xcite were motivated by the problem of the design of robust fully quantum controllers and left open the question of how to systematically build arbitrary linear quantum stochastic controllers as a suitable network of basic quantum devices .",
    "this paper addresses this open problem by developing synthesis results for general linear quantum stochastic systems for applications that are anticipated to extend beyond fully quantum controller synthesis , and it also proposes how to implement the synthesis in quantum optics . the organization of the rest of this paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : models ] details the mathematical modeling of linear dynamical quantum stochastic systems and defines the notion of an open oscillator and a generalized open oscillator , section [ sec : concat - ser - red - net ] gives an overview of the notions of the concatenation and series product for generalized open oscillators as well as the concept of a reducible quantum network with respect to the series product , and section [ sec : param - corspnds ] discusses the bijective correspondence between two descriptions of a linear dynamical quantum stochastic system .",
    "this is then followed by section [ sec : syn - theory ] that develops the main synthesis theorem which shows how to decompose an arbitrarily complex linear dynamical quantum stochastic system as an interconnection of simpler one degree of freedom generalized open oscillators , section [ sec : system - synth ] that proposes the physical implementation of arbitrary one degree of freedom generalized open oscillators and direct interaction hamiltonians between these oscillators , and section [ sec : example ] that provides an explicit example of the application of the main synthesis theorem to the construction of a two degrees of freedom open oscillator .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclude ] provides a summary of the contributions of the paper and conclusions .",
    "in the previous works @xcite linear dynamical quantum stochastic systems were essentially considered as open quantum harmonic oscillators . here",
    "we shall consider a more general class of linear dynamical quantum stochastic systems consisting of the cascade of a static passive linear quantum network with an open quantum harmonic oscillator .",
    "however , in this paper we restrict our attention to synthesis of linear systems with purely quantum dynamics , whereas the earlier work @xcite considers a more general scenario where a mixture of both quantum and classical dynamics is allowed ( via the concept of an augmentation of a quantum linear stochastic system ) .",
    "the class of mixed classical and quantum controllers will be considered in a separate work . to this end , let us first recall the definition of an open quantum harmonic oscillator ( for further details , see @xcite ) .    in this paper we shall use the following notations : @xmath67",

    "the integer @xmath30 will be referred to as the _ degrees of freedom _ of the oscillator .",
