    "about a dozen of @xmath19 radio pulsars observed in x - rays belong to the group of the so - called vela - like pulsars , with spindown ages @xmath2030 kyr and spindown powers @xmath21 of a few @xmath22 ergs s@xmath5 . their radiation usually show a thermal component , possibly emitted from the cooling neutron star ( ns ) surface , and a nonthermal component with a power - law ( pl ) x - ray spectrum , presumably originating in the pulsar magnetosphere ( see kaspi et al .",
    "2006 for a review ) .",
    "these pulsars are enveloped by pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) whose x - ray emission is due to the wind of ultrarelativistic particles shocked in the ambient medium ( kargaltsev et al .  2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , in addition to studying pulsar magnetospheres and ns cooling , x - ray observations of vela - like pulsars allow one to study pulsar winds , the ambient medium , and their interaction .",
    "psr b182313 ( also known as psr j18261334 , hereafter referred to as b1823 ) is a typical vela - like pulsar .",
    "it was detected in the jodrell bank radio survey ( clifton et al .",
    "its period , @xmath23 ms , and period derivative , @xmath24 s s@xmath5 , imply the spindown age @xmath25 kyr , spindown power @xmath26 ergs s@xmath5 , and surface magnetic field @xmath27 g. the distance to the pulsar , @xmath28 kpc , was estimated from the pulsar s dispersion measure ( @xmath29 pc @xmath30 ) using the models of galactic electron distribution ( taylor & cordes 1993 ; cordes & lazio 2002 ) .",
    "although such a young pulsar is expected to reside in a supernova remnant ( snr ) , observations of this field with the very large array ( vla ) have not found an snr , nor a radio pwn ( braun , goss , & lyne 1989 ; frail & scharringhausen 1997 ; gaensler et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "this pulsar is particularly interesting because it possibly powers an extended ( @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath32 pc , in size ) very high energy ( vhe ) @xmath18-ray source hess j1825137 ( aharonian et al .",
    "2005,2006 ) .",
    "the @xmath18-ray emission extends asymmetrically south - southwest of b1823 , with the peak surface brightness @xmath33 from the pulsar .",

    "these authors discuss a scenario in which the @xmath18-rays are produced by compton upscattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons off the ultrarelativistic electrons supplied by the pulsar . as the @xmath18-ray luminosity of the source , @xmath37 above 200 gev [ @xmath38 ,",
    "is only a factor of 10 lower than the pulsar s spindown power , a06 propose that the spindown power was significantly higher in the past , when the electrons responsible for the currently observed tev emission were produced by the pulsar .    although the field of b1823 has been observed with _ rosat _ , , and _ xmm - newton _ , the x - ray spectrum of the pulsar and the structure of its surroundings remained unclear because of the relatively low angular resolution of those missions .",
    "finley et al .",
    "( 1996 , f96 hereafter ) observed b1823 with the _ rosat _ observatory and , despite the small number of source counts detected ( e.g. , 127 counts from a @xmath39 radius circle around the pulsar position in the 14.7 ks pspc exposure ) found evidence of a point source surrounded by a compact pwn of @xmath40 radius , and a dimmer component extending up to @xmath41 south - southwest of the pulsar . because of the poor statistics , it was impossible to measure the spectra . for an upper limit on the hydrogen column density , @xmath42 , f96 estimated the upper limit fluxes at a few @xmath43  level for the emission components , corresponding to luminosities @xmath44@xmath45 erg s@xmath5 in the 0.52.4 kev range .",
    "sakurai et al .",
    "( 2001 ) were able to detect the extended structure around the b1823 position with _ asca _ , but that observation lacked the spatial resolution to separate the components .",
    "gaensler et al .  ( 2003 , g03 hereafter ) observed b1823 with the _ xmm - newton _  epic detectors .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _  resolution turned out to be too low to resolve the pulsar , but g03 detected two components of the pwn ( designated as g18.00.7 based on its galactic coordinates ) associated with this pulsar : a `` core '' of a @xmath46 extent , elongated in the east - west direction , and a large - scale diffuse component of lower surface brightness , @xmath47 in extent , seen mostly to the south of the pulsar .",
    "fitting the core and diffuse component spectra with a pl model , g03 found the photon indices @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and 0.510 kev luminosities @xmath50 , @xmath51 , for a foreground hydrogen column density @xmath52 .",
    "they suggested that the core represents the pulsar wind termination shock at a distance @xmath53 from the the pulsar while the diffuse component indicates the shocked downstream wind .",
    "g03 propose that the asymmetric morphology of the diffuse component with respect to the pulsar is the result of a reverse shock from an associated snr , which has compressed and distorted the pwn .",
    "they place limits on the pulsar s thermal emission : @xmath54 kev and bolometric luminosity @xmath55 ( as seen by a distant observer ) , assuming that the ns emits as a blackbody of a radius @xmath56 km , for @xmath57 .    because of its superior angular resolution , _ chandra_is suited much better than any other x - ray observatory for studying small - scale extended structures ( such as the core of the b1823 pwn ) and resolving point sources possibly projected onto such structures .",
    "therefore , our group proposed a _",
    "chandra _ observation of b1823 , with the goal to separate the pulsar from the pwn , measure their spectra , investigate the pwn morphology with the best possible resolution , and compare the pulsar and pwn properties with those of other vela - like pulsars .",
    "the data from that observation immediately showed that the pulsar can indeed be separated from the pwn , the `` core '' pwn is highly nonuniform in surface brightness , and the overall pwn morphology is more complicated than it had been presumed based on the previous low - resolution x - ray observations .",
    "these results have been reported at several conferences ( teter et al .  2003a , b ; gonzalez & kaspi 2006 ; kargaltsev et al .  2006 ) , but they have not been published in a refereed journal . in this paper , we decribe the analysis and results of the _ chandra _  observations and present infrared ( ir ) and radio images of the field (  2 ) . as the interpretation of the pwn morphology strongly depends on the direction and magnitude of the pulsar s proper motion , we also report the proper motion measurement in  3 .",
    "implications of our findings for the pulsar and pwn physics , including the vhe @xmath18-radiation , are discussed in  4 , while  5 summarizes the results of this work .",
    "b1823 was observed with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) aboard _ chandra _ on 2002 october 24 ( obsid 2830 ) .",
    "although last 13 ks of the 40,836 s exposure suffered from flaring particle background ( @xmath58 counts s@xmath5 per pixel , on average ) , we have checked that filtering out the periods of elevated background at the expense of shortening the exposure time would actually reduce the signal - to - noise ratio for the pulsar and the compact pwn and only very slightly increase it for the large - scale extended pwn ; therefore , we chose to use the whole exposure for our analysis .",
    "the observation was carried out in faint mode , and the target was imaged on s3 chip , with the radio pulsar position @xmath59 from the optical axis , where the angular resolution is still not degraded .",
    "the other acis chips activated during this observation were s1 , s2 , s4 , i2 , and i3 .",
    "the detector was operated in full frame mode , which provides time resolution of 3.24 seconds .",
    "we analyzed the data reprocessed by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) on 2006 october 11 ( rev .  2 ;",
    "ascdsver 7.6.9 ) .",
    "the data were reduced using the chandra interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) software ( ver .",

    "the white arrow shows the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ( see  3 ) .",
    "the length of the arrow , @xmath63 , corresponds to the distance that the pulsar travels during 300 years .",

    "the coordinates of the highest peak in the x - ray brightness distribution ( which is at the center of a @xmath66 pixel island , with equal numbers of counts in each of the 4 pixels ) are @xmath67 , @xmath68 ( j2000 ) , with an estimated @xmath69 centroiding error of @xmath70 for each of the coordinates .",
    "this position differs by @xmath71 in right ascension and @xmath72 in declination from the radio pulsar position , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , calculated from the original position in hobbs et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for the epoch of the _ chandra _ observation ( mjd 52,571 ) , using the proper motion measurement described in  3 .",
    "these differences are smaller than the combined errors ( @xmath75 in right ascension and @xmath76 in declination , at the 68% level ) of the peak position measurement , radio position , and _",
    "chandra _ absolute astrometry . therefore , there are no doubts that the highest brightness peak corresponds to the pulsar b1823 while the surrounding emission represents its pwn .",
    "we see from figures 1 and 2 that the pwn morphology is asymmetric and nonuniform .",
    "the brightest _ inner _ pwn component ( surface brightness in the range of 423 counts arcsec@xmath77 in 0.77 kev ) , is @xmath78 ( i.e.  @xmath79 pc@xmath80 at @xmath81 kpc ) in size .",
    "it is approximately centered on the pulsar and elongated along the northeast - southwest direction ( position angle @xmath82 , measured east of north ) .",
    "the inner component is embedded in a dimmer ( average surface brightness @xmath83 counts arcsec@xmath77 in 0.77 kev ) _ outer _",
    "component of the _ compact pwn _ , within a @xmath84 area .",
    "it is stretched along the east - west direction , with the pulsar being closer to its east end ( i.e. the outer component is more extended in the direction approximately opposite to the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ; see  3 ) .",
    "its surface brightness distribution is rather nonuniform , with a prominent enhancement @xmath85 west of the pulsar ( we designate it as the `` blob '' and mark ` b ' in the figures ) .",
    "the smoothed subpixel - resolution image shown in figure 1 ( _ top right _ )",
    "suggests that the blob is connected to the inner pwn component by a faint `` bridge '' .",
    "we have checked that there are no optical - nir counterparts to the blob in the catalogs available ( e.g. , the nearest 2mass counterpart is @xmath86 away ) .",
    "another compact source is seen in the images @xmath87 east of the pulsar .",
    "this object , cxou 182614.4@xmath0133448 ( hereafter referred to as source x ) is point - like .",
    "the analysis of its spectrum (  2.5 ) shows that it is likely a background agn , unrelated to b1823 .",
    "the smoothed image in figure 2 ( _ top _ ) shows marginal evidence of two @xmath40-long `` tails '' , apparently emanating from the pulsar in the west - northwest and west - southwest directions .",
    "the linear profiles in the middle and bottom panels of figure 2 show that the outer pwn structure is discernible above the local background level of @xmath88 counts arcsec@xmath77 up to @xmath89 and @xmath90 east and west of the pulsar , respectively .",
    "the compact pwn ( comprised of the above - described inner and outer components ) is , in turn , immersed in an even dimmer large - scale diffuse emission apparent in heavily binned images . as it is natural to assume that this diffuse emission is also produced by the wind from b1823",
    ", we will call it the _ extended _ pwn .",
    "it is mostly concentrated southward of the compact pwn , and it is discernible in the acis images up to the edge of the s3 chip ( i.e.  @xmath91 from the pulsar ; fig .  1 , _ bottom right _ ) .",
    "( it likely extends further into the s2 chip , but the lower sensitivity of this chip does not allow a reliable analysis of the faint diffuse emission . ) the extended pwn is somewhat better seen in the _ xmm - newton _ epic mos1+mos2 image shown in figure 3_c _ ( see also g03 ) .",
    "however , the true extent of this dim diffuse component is difficult to determine even in the large field - of - view of the mos detectors because of the strong vignetting at large off - axis angles and high epic background .",
    "we extracted the compact pwn spectrum ( fig .  4 , _ top _ ) from the ellipse shown in figure 1 ( _ bottom left _ ) , excluding the counts within the @xmath92 circle centered on the x - ray position of the pulsar ( see  2.1 ) and restricting the energy range to 0.77 kev .",
    "this region of 225 arcsec@xmath80 area contains 415 counts .",
    "we estimated the background from the annulus of 2916 arcsec@xmath80 area shown in fig .  1 ( _ bottom right _ ) , which contains 511 counts .",
    "thus , there are @xmath93 compact pwn counts in the aperture chosen .    to analyze the spectrum of the extended pwn ( fig .  4 , _ bottom _ ) , we chose the polygon encompassing the region of brightest emission south of the pulsar , with the area of 3.4 arcmin@xmath94 ( see fig .  1 , _ bottom right _ ) , which contains 2329 counts in the 0.77 kev band .",
    "the background was extracted from the @xmath95 circular region shown in the same panel , which contains 2004 counts .",
    "subtracting the background contribution , we obtain @xmath96 extended pwn counts in the polygon aperture .",
    "( we have also tried several other background regions but this did not lead to significant changes in the spectral fits . )",
    "first , we fit the compact and extended pwn spectra with the absorbed power - law ( pl ) model , allowing the hydrogen column density to vary .",
    "the confidence contours obtained from these fits are shown in figure 5 .",
    "we see that the 90% confidence contours for the compact and extended pwn do not overlap , which suggests that the two spectra are different .",
    "since we do not expect the hydrogen column density , @xmath97 , to differ significantly on such a small , @xmath98 , scale , we ascribe the difference to different spectral slopes , @xmath99 .    to estimate the spectral slopes more accurately , it would be useful to restrict the range of @xmath100 ( which would also be helpful for the spectral analysis of the pulsar ",
    "see  2.4 ) .",
    "the fits with free @xmath100 give @xmath101 and @xmath102 for the compact and extended pwne , respectively ( the uncertainties correspond to the 68% confidence level for a single interesting parameter ) .",
    "the values of @xmath103 obtained by g03 using the _ xmm - newton _ data are in the range of 0.81.7 , depending upon the spectral model and extraction region chosen . the estimate based on the pulsar s dispersion measure ( dm@xmath104 @xmath30 ) and the usual assumption of 10% degree of ionization of the interstellar medium ( ism ) gives @xmath105 .",
    "this is close to the lower limit , @xmath106 , estimated from the observed colors of the foreground ( @xmath107 kpc ) o6 star hd 169727 , projected @xmath108 southeast of the pulsar ( f96 ) . finally , the total galactic hi column in that direction is @xmath1091.5 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) .",
    "since the @xmath100 values deduced from an x - ray spectrum under the assumption of standard element abundances usually exceed the @xmath110 measured from 21 cm observations by a factor of 1.53 ( e.g. , baumgartner & mushotzky 2005 ) , this @xmath110 value does not contradict to those estimated from the x - ray fits and the dispersion measure .",
    "thus , with allowance for different kinds of uncertainties , it seems reasonable to assume @xmath111 , with @xmath112 being the most plausible estimate .    with the hydrogen column density fixed at @xmath113 , the absorbed pl fits to the compact and extended pwn yield photon indices @xmath114 and @xmath115 , and 0.58 kev luminosities @xmath116 and @xmath117 ergs s@xmath5 ( see also fig .  6 and table 1 ; the extended pwn luminosity is for the polygon region ) .",
    "although the peak of the surface brightness distribution is clearly dominated by the pulsar , the surface brightness of the inner pwn grows toward the pulsar s position , which introduces some ambiguity in separating the pulsar contrubution from that of the pwn and complicates the measurement of the pulsar spectrum . however , based on the surface brightness distribution near the peak ( see , e.g. , the one - dimensional profiles in fig .",
    "2 ) , it seems reasonable to assume that the pwn surface brightness reaches a plateau of about @xmath118 in size , centered on the pulsar , which can be used to estimate the local background at the pulsar position .",
    "therefore , we extracted the pulsar spectrum from a small circular aperture ( small black circle in fig .  1 , _ bottom left _ ) with the radius of 1 acis pixel ( @xmath119 , 55% encircled energy radius ) and took the background from the @xmath120 circular annulus centered on the pulsar ( shown by the white circles in fig .  1 , _",
    "bottom left _ ) .",
    "the background contributes @xmath121 counts to 62 counts extracted from the source region .",
    "given the small number of source counts and the appreciable background contribution , we chose not to subtract the background channel by channel but rather fit the background spectrum ( modeled as an absorbed pl model with the same @xmath100 as for the source ) simultaneously with the source spectrum .    to obtain better constrained fits with the small number of counts available , we are forced to freeze the hydrogen column density . since the interpretation of the pulsar spectrum ( e.g. , thermal vs.nonthermal ) may depend on the choice of the @xmath100 value , we fit the pulsar spectrum with the absorbed pl model for three plausible values of the hydrogen column density : @xmath105 , 1.0 , and 1.3 ( see table 2 and fig .",
    "as expected , the inferred photon indices depend on the choice of @xmath100 , changing from @xmath122 to @xmath123 with increasing @xmath100 ( see table 2 for details ) .",
    "the pulsar s absorbed flux is @xmath124 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath5 in the 0.77 kev band ( corrected for the background and finite aperture ) .",
    "the unabsorbed pulsar luminosity in the 0.58 kev band increases from @xmath125 to @xmath126 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath5 , respectively .",
    "the steepness of the best - fit pl spectra , especially in the case of larger @xmath100 , indicates the presence of thermal emission from the ns surface , such as seen in other vela - like pulsars ( e.g. , pavlov et al .",
    "however , adding the second blackbody ( bb ) component is not justified statistically ( i.e.  the contribution of the bb component is negligible , and the fitting parameters of the bb component are unconstrained ) at @xmath127 and 1.0 , while in the case of @xmath128 the fit converges to a reasonable ( although still poorly constrained ) values of the surface temperature @xmath129 ev , projected emitting area @xmath130 km@xmath94 ( corresponding to the bolometric luminosity @xmath131 ergs s@xmath5 ) , and the slope of the pl component @xmath132 .",
    "the fitting parameters become better constrained if we fix the area , but the best - fit temperature and luminosity depend on the value of @xmath133 because of the strong @xmath133-@xmath134 correlation . for instance",
    ", @xmath135 increases from 97 to 139 ev , and @xmath136 decreases from @xmath137 to @xmath138 ergs s@xmath5 , when @xmath133 decreases from 500 km@xmath94 ( approximate projected area of the ns surface ) to 20 km@xmath94 ( projected area in the pl+bb fit for the vela pulsar spectrum ) .",
    "given the errors of these fits and the uncertainty of ism absorption , the obtained bb parameters are just crude estimates .",

    "similar to other vela - like pwne , the pwn luminosity exceeds by a factor of a few the pulsar luminosity in the same x - ray energy range , @xmath233 .",
    "the morphology of the extended pwn is even more puzzling than that of the compact one . in the conventional picture of a bow - shock pwn",
    ", we would expect to see an extended component _ behind _ the compact pwn of the moving pulsar , which would look like a `` tail '' . in b1823 , however , the pwn extends southward from the pulsar , almost perpendicular to the proper motion direction , similar to the extended diffuse pwn of the vela pulsar ( pavlov et al .",
    "this means that something is deflecting ( or has deflected ) the shocked pw in this direction .",
    "one could imagine a local north wind in the turbulent ambient medium , but such a wind would have to blow with a velocity of several hundred km s@xmath5 ( comparable to the pulsar velocity ) to displace the pwn bubble . if such a wind were blowing now , we would see the compact pwn elongated southward from the pulsar , and , more importantly , it would be not a usual wind but a shock , since the required velocity almost certainly exceeds the sound speed .",
    "thus , it seems we have to assume that the pwn bubble was crushed / displaced by a passing shock some time ago .",
    "a natural candidate for such a shock is the reverse shock from the surrounding snr that has propagated back inward and collided with the pwn , displacing the pwn bubble from the pulsar , as has been suggested by blondin et al .",
    "( 2001 ) for the strongly dispaced vela x component of the vela pwn .",
    "such an explanation for the one - sided extended pwn of b1823 has been proposed by g03 , and we currently do not see an alternative explanation . if this hypothesis is correct , we may expect the extended pwn to consist of two components : a strongly displaced one ( similar to vela x ) , which represents a relic population of relativistic electrons that have lost a substantial fraction of their energy to synchrotron , inverse comption , and adiabatic cooling , and a younger one , which represents electrons that entered the pwn after the inverse shock passage .",
    "although the crushed / dragged pwn hypothesis looks attractive and provides a plausible explanation for the extended x - ray pwn , we should mention that it does not so readily expalin the huge , about 70 pc at @xmath81 kpc , size of the tev pwn . traveling 70 pc in time",
    "@xmath234 requires the average velocity @xmath235 km s@xmath5 , too high for a reverse shock .",
    "even if we assume @xmath236 kyr ( i.e. , equal to the pulsar s spindown age ) , we still need @xmath237 km s@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , it is hard to imagine how the reverse shock could have dragged the relic pwn so far , even if it passed the pulsar very long time ago . perhaps , one should explore another possibility , that during a substantial fraction of the pulsar s lifetime the pwn electrons have been transported southward from the pulsar along an anisotropic large - scale magnetic field . alternatively , one might assume a strongly anisotropic supply of electrons into the pwn , e.g. , through a one - sided jet ( which , however , is not seen in the images available ) . at this point , however , these possibilities remain highly speculative .    as has been noticed by g03",
    ", the extended pwn spectrum is softer than the compact pwn spectrum , which is also confirmed by our results ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "the difference of the photon indices , @xmath238 , supports the hypothesis that the extended x - ray pwn electrons have lost their energy to synchrotron cooling after traveling a distance of a few parsecs .",
    "the slope @xmath239 we found for the x - ray spectrum is very close to the slope of the vhe @xmath18-ray spectrum within @xmath240 from the pulsar , @xmath2412.0 ( a06 ) , which confirms that both the x - ray and @xmath18-ray emission are due to the same electron population with a power - law energy spectrum @xmath242 , with @xmath2433 .",
    "interestingly , the tev spectrum at larger distances from the pulsar , where we do not see the x - ray pwn , becomes even softer ( @xmath34 grows up to @xmath244 at @xmath245 from the pulsar ) .",
    "because we can see only part of the extended pwn in our acis image ( see  2.2 ) , we can measure only a fraction of its x - ray luminosity ( @xmath246 ergs s@xmath5 in the 3.4 arcmin@xmath80 region shown in fig .  1 , _ bottom right _ ) .",
    "the total extended pwn luminosity should be a factor of a few higher .",
    "for instance , g03 found @xmath247 ergs s@xmath5 in a 33.4 arcmin@xmath80 area , which corresponds to the extended pwn efficiency @xmath248 , a factor of @xmath249 higher than that of the compact pwn .",
    "although we have resolved the pulsar from the pwn , the small number of pulsar counts detected and the strong and not well determined background from the inner component of the compact pwn preclude a precise spectral analysis .",
    "we can only estimate the pulsar luminosity , @xmath250 ergs s@xmath5 in the 0.58 kev band , which is a small fraction , @xmath251 , of the pulsar s spindown power @xmath21 .",
    "the slope of the pulsar spectrum , @xmath2523 , is strongly correlated with the ism column density ( see fig .  7 ) .",
    "it is likely that the spectrum consists of two components , magnetospheric and thermal , but the photon statistics does not allow one to separate these components unambiguously . for @xmath128 ( at the higher end of the plausible @xmath100 range ) and",
    "projected emitting areas in the range of @xmath253@xmath254 km@xmath80 , we found @xmath255150 ev and @xmath256@xmath257 ergs s@xmath5 for a possible bb component ( higher luminosities correspond to lower temperates and larger emitting areas ) .",
    "these temperatures and luminosities are generally similar to those of other vela - like pulsars ( e.g. , @xmath258 ev , @xmath259 km@xmath80 , @xmath260 ergs s@xmath5 for the vela pulsar ; pavlov et al .",
    "2001 ) . however , because of the large uncertainties and poorly constrained @xmath100 , we can not be sure even in the detection of the thermal component , not to mention measuring its parameters .",
    "therefore , we should treat the estimated bolometric luminosities of b1823 as upper limits rather than actually measured values .",
    "the most conservative of the above limits , @xmath261 ergs s@xmath5 , corresponding to @xmath262 km@xmath80 and @xmath263 ev , is close to the bolometric luminosities predicted by the so - called `` standard '' ns cooling model for the ns age of 20 kyr ( see , e.g. , fig .  2 in tsuruta 1998 ) .",
    "overall , we can conclude that b1823 looks like a typical vela - like pulsar , but a deeper high - resolution observation is needed to infer its properties in more detail .",
    "we see no emission in our acis images that could be ascribed to an snr associated with b1823 , and no such emission has been reported from the previous x - ray ( f96 ; g03 ) or radio ( braun et al .",
    "1989 ; brogan et al .",
    "2006 ) observations . using our proper motion measurement , we extrapolated the pulsar trajectory back in time to check whether or not it crosses a known snr .",
    "the nearest snr to the pulsar trajectory is the @xmath264 shell snr g18.160.16 ( brogan et al .",
    "2006 ) at a distance of @xmath265 from the current pulsar position .",
    "since the extrapolated trajectory misses the snr center by @xmath266 , we conclude that g18.160.16 is not related to b1823 .    the failure to detect the host snr in x - rays",
    "can be attributed to the strong ism absorption of the soft thermal emission from the snr interiors ( see kargaltsev et al .",
    "2007 , where a similar situation is discussed regarding the vela - like psr b180021 , which also lacks an associated snr ) .",
    "therefore , it is possible that b1823 is still within the interiors of an evolved snr , which is undetectable in x - ray or radio , but whose pressure can contribute to the pwn confinement .",
    "the important discovery of the vhe @xmath18-ray spectral softening with increasing distance from b1823 ( a06 ) has provided further evidence that this pulsar / pwn is the main source of the ultrarelativistic electrons powering the tev plerion .",
    "qualitative models for this vhe @xmath18-ray source have been discussed in a number of works ( a06 ; de jager et al .",
    "2005 ; de jager 2007 ) .",
    "generally , they interpret the @xmath18-ray emission as produced by the compton upscattering of the cmb photons by electrons with energies @xmath267100 tev [ electron lorentz factor @xmath268@xmath269 , supplied by the b1823 pulsar .",
    "the fact that the pulsar is located at the northern boundary of the tev plerion is explained by the effect of the snr reverse shock that has dragged the relic pwn southward .",
    "( an alternative explanation , that the tev plerion represents electrons left behind the pulsar moving northward , is invalidated by our measurement of the proper motion . )",
    "the softening of the tev spectrum with the distance from the pulsar can be ascribed to the radiative losses ( mostly to the ic scattering losses ) or some energy - dependent `` convection '' , or variation of the particle injection spectrum with the pulsar s age .",
    "as a06 note , even at very low ambient magnetic fields , @xmath270 g , when the ic energy losses dominate the synchrotron losses , the @xmath18-ray efficiency , @xmath271 , is unrealistically high if we use the current value of @xmath21 .",
    "this supports the hypothesis that the vhe @xmath18-ray emission is produced by relic electrons emitted by the pulsar when it was very young and much more powerful .",
    "modelling of the tev plerion is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we only note some open problems with the current interpretation of this remarkable object .",
    "first , as we have mentioned in  4.1 , it is difficult to reconcile the very large size of the tev plerion with the hypothesis that the relic pwn was dragged by the snr reverse shock to its current position . in principle",
    ", other sources of ultrarelativistic electrons within the @xmath272 size field could contribute to the observed tev emission and increase the apparent size of the tev source .",
    "our analysis of several x - ray sources in the brightest part of the tev plerion has not shown any obvious candidates ( see  2.5 ) , but one can not rule out the possibility that there are such sources outside the small acis field - of - view .",
    "another possible problem with the current interpretation of the tev source is the spatial distribution of its brightness and spectrum .",
    "the brightest part of the tev plerion is offset by @xmath273 ( @xmath274 pc in the plane of the sky ) south - southwest of the pulsar ( see fig .  1 of a06 )",
    ", while the plerion extends @xmath275 further in the same direcion ( almost perpendicular to the direction of the pulsar s proper motion ) .",
    "one could speculate that the relic pwn was displaced by @xmath273 some time ago [ which would require a reverse shock speed of @xmath276 km s@xmath5 ] , and its relativistic electrons have been diffusing from that position .",
    "it is however , unclear as to why they diffused not radially but preferentially in the south - southwest direction .",
    "if the passing shock not just displaced the relic pwn to a certain distance but smeared it all over the whole extent of the currently seen tev plerion , then a very high shock speed would be required ( see  4.1 ) .",
    "furthermore , the spectral map of hessj1825 ( see figs",
    ".  5 and 6 of a06 ) shows that the vhe @xmath18-ray spectrum softens radially not from the maximum of the brightness distribution but from the pulsar position .",
    "this hints that at least some contribution to the tev photons comes from the same young electrons that are responsible for the extended x - ray pwn of a much smaller size .",
    "this conjecture is further supported by the fact that the spectral slopes of the x - ray ( synchrotron ) and @xmath18-ray ( ic ) spectra are about the same at a few arcminute distance from the pulsar , which suggests that they are generated by the same population of electrons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the tev @xmath18-ray emission is due to the ic scattering of the cmb photons , and the relativistic electrons are mostly supplied by the pulsar , one should expect the tev brightness to peak at the pulsar position , not @xmath278 from the pulsar .",
    "this inconsistency might be alleviated assuming that in the immediate vicinity of the pulsar , where the electrons are more energetic , they upscatter the cmb photons in the klein - nishina regime , which results in a lower brightness of the ic scattered radiation , but it remains to be seen from detailed models whether or not this assumption is realistic .",
    "overall , it seems plausible at this point that , at least in the extended x - ray pwn region , the tev emission can be produced by two electron populations of different ages . to infer the properties of these populations , deep observations with _ xmm - newton",
    "_ and _ glast _ of a region from which _ both _ x - ray and vhe @xmath18-ray emission is seen would be very helpful .",
    "another issue related to the nature of the tev plerion and its connection to the b1823 pulsar / pwn is whether the tev photons are produced by upscattering of the cmb or some other radiation .",
    "close to the galactic plane , where hessj1825 is situated , a factor of a few higher radiation energy density can be provided by ir emission from interstellar dust and galactic starlight .",
    "for instance , at the galactocentric distance of 4 kpc , the models of interstellar radiation by strong et al .",
    "( 2000 ) give the energy densities of 0.6 and 2.7 ev @xmath30 for these two components , respectively , versus 0.26 ev @xmath30 for the cmb .",
    "moreover , if there are very luminous sources of radiation ( such as molecular / dust complexes in star - forming regions ) in the vicinity of the source of ultrarelativistic electrons , the high radiation energy density around these sources can strongly enhance the tev luminosity ( see , e.g. , kargaltsev & pavlov 2007 ) . in this regard , the bright radio - ir source a ( see fig .  3 ) , whose spectrum peaks at @xmath279 m , might be of some interest . with the bolometric flux @xmath280 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath5 , its radiation energy density exceeds the ambient radiation energy density @xmath281 at angular distances @xmath282 .",
    "if the distance to source a is about the same as to b1823 , and the tev emission is produced by the ic scattering of ir photons with energies around 0.03 ev ( which would require electron energies @xmath28320 tev ) , then source a could create a few arcminute size brightening .",
    "moreover , if there are hot and massive stars hidden within this dust / molecular complex of @xmath284 pc size , their shocked winds could be additional sources of tev electrons , further enhancing the vhe @xmath18-ray emission from this region .",
    "( vhe @xmath18-rays apparently produced by stellar winds in the open stellar cluster westerlund 2 have recently been detected by aharonian et al .",
    "although this hypothesis looks rather speculative at this point , and source a can not be responsible for the bulk of the detected tev radiation , dedicated observations of this region in the ir and radio would help evaluate the source a contribution to hessj1825 .",
    "the high - resolution _ chandra _ acis observation has allowed us to resolve the b1823 pulsar from its pwn , image the pwn structure , and measure the spectra of the pulsar and the pwn components .",
    "we found that the pulsar s x - ray luminosity , @xmath285 ergs s@xmath5 in the 0.58 kev band , and spectrum are similar to those of other vela - like pulsars , but the small number of pulsar counts and the contamination from the inner pwn component do not allow an unambiguous separation of the thermal and nonthermal components of the pulsar radiation .",
    "we have measured the pulsar s proper motion and found its transverse velocity , @xmath286 km s@xmath5 at @xmath81 kpc , close to an average velocity of young radio pulsars .",
    "we found no indication of an snr , in neither x - rays nor radio , between the current position of the pulsar and its birthplace , @xmath287 westward .    we have confirmed the presence of the compact and extended pwne of different shapes , surface brightnesses , and spectra .",
    "the compact pwn , of @xmath288 pc@xmath80 size in the plane of the sky , is elongated approximately along the proper motion direcion , with the pulsar close to its leading edge .",
    "this suggests that the postshock pulsar wind in the compact pwn , responsible for its x - ray emission , is confined by the ram pressure due to the supersonic motion of the pulsar .",
    "the x - ray spectrum and luminosity , @xmath289 ergs s@xmath5 , of the compact pwn are similar to those of other vela - like pwne .",
    "the x - ray surface brightness distribution within the compact pwn is very nonuniform . in particular , we see a much brighter inner pwn component , @xmath290 pc@xmath80 , around the pulsar , inclined by @xmath225 with respect to the direction of the proper motion .",
    "such a structure indicates that the pulsar wind is intrincically anisotropic .",
    "if the inner pwn component represents the shocked equatorial outflow from the pulsar magnetosphere , the pulsar s spin axis is strongly inclined to the proper motion direction , in contrast to many other pulsars .",
    "the extended pwn is mostly seen south - southwest of the pulsar ( up to @xmath10 from the pulsar , in the acis image ) , almost perpendicular to the proper motion direction .",
    "its softer spectrum indicates that its x - ray emission is generated by older electrons that have lost part of their energy because of the radiative cooling .",
    "the southward displacement of the extended x - ray pwn with respect to the pulsar might be caused by a strong pressure gradient in the ambient medium and/or by the reverse snr shock , which has swept the pwn material southward .",
    "the extended x - ray pwn is apparently connected to the vhe @xmath18-ray pwn that extends in the same direction but to a much larger distance from the pulsar , up to 70 pc in the plane of the sky .",
    "the @xmath18-ray emission is likely due to the ic scattering of background radiation off the relativistic electrons with energies up to 100 tev supplied by the b1823 pulsar .",
    "however , the very high luminosity , @xmath291 ergs s@xmath5 , can only be explained if the bulk of @xmath18-radiation is generated by relic electrons , produced long ago , when the pulsar was much more powerful .",
    "the relic electrons could be displaced from the pulsar by a reverse snr shock , but it remains unclear as to why the @xmath18-ray pwn is so large .",
    "we have not found x - ray sources in the brightest part of the @xmath18-ray pwn which could significantly contribute to the @xmath18-radiation .",
    "although the ir - radio images of the field show a star - forming region in the brightest part of the @xmath18-ray pwn , which could enhance the @xmath18-ray emission by supplying additional photons for the ic scattering , and perhaps even additional relativistic electrons , it can be responsible only for a small fraction of the observed vhe @xmath18-radiation . to better understand the multiwavelength nature of the complex b1823 pwn , deep x - ray and ir observations of the field",

    "<S> we report on an observation of the vela - like pulsar b1823@xmath013 and its synchrotron nebula with the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. the pulsar s spectrum fits a power - law model with a photon index @xmath1 for the plausible hydrogen column density @xmath2 @xmath3 , corresponding to the luminosity @xmath4 ergs s@xmath5 in the 0.58 kev band , at a distance of 4 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the pulsar radiation likely includes magnetospheric and thermal components , but they can not be reliably separated because of the small number of counts detected and strong interstellar absorption . the pulsar is surrounded by a compact , @xmath6 , pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) elongated in the east - west direction , which includes a brighter inner component @xmath7 , elongated in the northeast - southwest direction . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of the compact pwn spectrum is @xmath8 , and the 0.58 kev luminosity is @xmath9 ergs s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the compact pwn is surrounded by asymmetric diffuse emission ( extended pwn ) seen up to at least @xmath10 south of the pulsar , with a softer spectrum ( @xmath11 for @xmath12 @xmath3 ) , and the 0.58 kev luminosity @xmath13@xmath14 ergs s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we also measured the pulsar s proper motion using archival vla data : @xmath15 mas yr@xmath5 , @xmath16 mas yr@xmath5 , which corresponds to the transverse velocity @xmath17 km s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the proper motion is approximately parallel to the elongation of the compact pwn , but it is nearly perpendicular to that of the extended pwn and to the direction towards the center of the bright vhe @xmath18-ray source hess j1825137 , which is likely powered by psr b1823@xmath013 . </S>"
