    "they have values of @xmath40.05 , which coincide with the zeropoint uncertainties .",
    "therefore the magnitudes of our catalog are accurate to @xmath40.05 mag .",
    "to detect sources and conduct photometry , we employed sextractor ( se ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we found optimal parameters for se to obtain high completeness while not sacrificing reliability of the detection ( sections [ sec : compl ] and [ sec : relia ] ) for all magnitude bins .",
    "to do so , we made artificial objects using the iraf ` noao.artdata ` package and they are placed randomly at the background regions of the images .",
    "we performed detections and photometry with various parameter settings .",
    "after many trials with varying se parameters , we chose the following set of detection parameters for se : detect_minarea=20 , detect_thresh=1.1 , deblend_nthresh=64 , deblend_mincont=0.005 , back_size=500 , back_filtersize=2 .",
    "the adopted detection parameters corresponds to @xmath59 .",
    "we detected 208,020 sources and 203,832 sources for @xmath0 and @xmath1band , respectively , at the magnitude limits brighter the 99@xmath46 reliability ( see section [ sec : relia ] ) . among these objects , 28.3@xmath46 in @xmath0 and 30.8@xmath46 in @xmath20",
    "are detected only in a single filter image .",
    "most of the sources detected only in a single filter image are those at near the magnitude limits , suggesting that they are missed in an image in the other band due to the detection limit .",
    "the reason for the percentage of sources detected only in @xmath6band being slightly higher is the deep @xmath6band catalog from @xcite .",
    "if a bright object of @xmath0 @xmath60 19 mag or @xmath20 @xmath60 20 mag has no counterpart in the other band , we find that they are a crosstalk or cosmic ray .",
    "we derived auto magnitudes with kron - like elliptical aperture @xcite , which are assumed to be total magnitudes .",
    "for the aperture magnitudes , we set the aperture diameter size to 3 times the fwhm .",
    "we found a diameter of 3 times the fwhm to be an optimal diameter which can contain the majority of the flux from an object but is not affected by the local fluctuation in the sky background .",
    "this has been checked by growth curves of objects with various magnitudes .",
    "the magnitude errors are computed by combining the standard se errors based on poisson statistics and the zeropoint errors . at the bright end ,",
    "the photometry is free from saturation above @xmath6110 mag and @xmath6211 mag .    since the stacking of the dithered frames with sub - pixels during preprocessing causes poor measurement of pixel - by - pixel rms for the correlated neighboring pixels , the errors from se , which only consider the poisson noise , can be underestimated . to improve the accuracy of the estimated errors",
    ", we adopted the method in @xcite and @xcite , calculating the noise rate induced by the pixel - by - pixel correlated noise .",
    "we place @xmath43000 apertures of a given size randomly located in the background area .",
    "the aperture has an area of @xmath63 and an effective diameter of @xmath64 .",
    "the background rms fluctuations are derived from a gaussian curve fit to the histogram of fluxes inside each aperture .",
    "the noise calculated from the rms fluctuations for a given effective diameter is expressed as @xmath65 .",
    "if the noise is only dependent on the poisson noise , it is independent from one pixel to another . therefore for this case , @xmath66",
    "however , for the adjoining pixels , the sky noise has @xmath67 . for our data ,",
    "we find @xmath68 .",
    "for an aperture with 5.4@xmath5 diameter ( 3 times the typical fwhm of our images ) , there are about 250 pixels ( or @xmath69 ) .",
    "therefore , the photometric errors of faint objects ( @xmath70 mag ) may be underestimated by a maximum factor of 3 . for the brighter objects ( @xmath71 mag ) ,",
    "the photometric errors are not affected by this effect , since their errors are dominated by noises from the source .",
    "the detection and photometry of the sources are carried out for each subfield image , rather than a single mosaic of all the subfields , since there is a variation in the weather condition among subfields .",
    "catalogs from individual subfields are then merged together to form a master catalog for each filter .",
    "however , since each subfield image overlaps with a neighboring images , catalogs created from each subfield image contain duplicate entries in the overlap region .",
    "to deal with the duplicate entries during the merging process of all the subfield catalogs , we set the criterion for choosing the entry with the smallest flags values from se and smallest photometric errors for multiple entries with positional offsets less than 1.5@xmath5 . only the object chosen with the above criterion , and its se output values derived from the chosen subfield are included in the final catalog .    when we merged the @xmath0 and @xmath1band catalogs , we used a 1.5@xmath5 radius .",
    "every row , regardless of whether they have information in both bands , is included in the final catalog .",
    "regarding the stellarity from se , we chose a single stellarity value for the final catalog where the photometric error of the source is smaller between the two filters .      the flamingos chip exhibits crosstalk artifacts between amplifiers on both sides of a bright source , where the crosstalk signals can be identified as doughnut - shaped signals at every 128 pixels , which corresponds to the width of one amplifier , from the position of a bright source .",
    "the strength of the crosstalk signal is stronger for a brighter source , and it decreases as the distance from the bright source increases .",
    "we examined the magnitude of the source that generates crosstalks and the positions of the crosstalks .",
    "the crosstalks start to be seen on both sides of a bright source at a magnitude of @xmath72 mag and @xmath73 mag in the stacked image . for sources that are about 3 magnitudes brighter than that limit",
    ", the crosstalks continue to the end of a quadrant .",
    "the bright sources create the crosstalk signal at distances of multiples of 256 pixels in our stacked image whose pixel sizes are a half of the pixel size of the raw image .",
    "the direction in which the crosstalks appeared depends on the readout direction and where the object is located , but it is predictable . using these properties , we predicted the positions of the crosstalks and included the flag information for objects at these points in our merged catalog that the object is a potential crosstalk signal or its photometry is affected by the crosstalk .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath45band imaging was conducted in 2004 , covering 750 arcmin@xmath2 near the center of nep - deep by @xcite , where we avoided duplicate observation in @xmath6band . to construct a continuous area coverage of the @xmath6band imaging in the nep field",
    ", we included the @xmath6band images from @xcite when creating a catalog of @xmath6band sources .",
    "for consistency in the final catalog , we conducted new detections and photometry using our own method ( see section [ sec : detec ] ) .",
    "their flux calibration was done using standard stars listed in @xcite , resulting in uncertainties in the flux calibration up to 0.1 mag .",
    "we were able to reduce the errors to less than 0.05 mag using our flux calibration method ( see section [ sec : calib ] ) .",
    "we added this catalog to the final catalog to fill the gap in the nep field from our @xmath6band survey .",
    "the average depths of images of @xcite are @xmath40.3 mag deeper than those of our data .",
    "we used the same method as @xcite to separate galaxies from stars .",
    "since most stars have similar slopes at wavelengths greater than 1@xmath7 on their seds , nir colors of stars lie in narrow range while those of distant galaxies are more diverse due to redshifted sed .",
    "figure [ f07 ] shows the @xmath74 versus @xmath75 color - color diagram .",
    "the stellar locus can clearly be seen by the clouded gray points and overlapping contour ( @xmath76 0.5 ) .",
    "also the redshift tracks of two types of galaxies are shown to check the location of galaxies .",
    "the dashed line is a redshift track of a star - forming galaxy ( m51 ) and the dotted line is that of a passively evolving 5 gyr - old galaxy with a spontaneous burst , a metallicity z=0.02 , and the salpeter initial mass function ( imf ) created with the @xcite model .",
    "as indicated in figure [ f07 ] , we find that the galaxies and stars can be separated effectively with a color cut at @xmath77 mag , where objects with @xmath78 are mostly stars .",
    "however , galaxies at z @xmath79 also have @xmath80 mag , and there are also stars with peculiar colors with @xmath81 .",
    "to deal with such case , we also use the stellarity parameter from se of objects in the optical catalog @xcite since the optical images offer better spatial resolution ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the se stellarity parameter has a value between 1 ( point source ) and 0 ( extended source ) . for the galaxies with @xmath80 mag",
    ", they can be selected using the criterion stellarity @xmath83 0.8 . likewise , point sources with stellarity @xmath84 0.8 with @xmath85 mag are classified as stars .",
    "this method was applied only to objects brighter than the 50@xmath46 completeness magnitude , which corresponds to @xmath86 20 mag or @xmath87 22 ( see figure 6 in @xcite and figure 2 in @xcite ) , since the 50@xmath46 completeness magnitude is the limit for which the stellarity parameter can be used to separate the extended sources from the point sources .",
    "near the detection limit , all objects fainter than the magnitude of 50@xmath46 completeness are considered as galaxies .",
    "table [ t04 ] shows a part of the @xmath0 and @xmath1band merged catalog .",

    "the magnitude cut was computed independently for each field in each filter ( see section [ sec : relia ] ) .",
    "the catalog contains 15 columns ; identification number ( i d ) , the right ascension ( r.a . ) and declination ( decl . ) , @xmath0 and @xmath1band magnitudes and errors , stellarity , galactic extinction values for each filter , and the information about the crosstalk .",
    "the object ids consist of their field name and number in the order of their r.a . for each field . for both @xmath0 and @xmath1band",
    ", we provide two kinds of magnitudes ; auto magnitude ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) using kron - like elliptical aperture and aperture magnitude ( @xmath90 and @xmath91 ) within a circular aperture with a diameter of three times fwhm .",

    "the stellarities have values between 0 ( extended source ) and 1 ( point source ) , and the distributions of the stellarities are also shown in figure [ f08 ] .",
    "the galactic extinction values are from the extinction map of @xcite . since the color excess @xmath92 has values of 0.034  0.058 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 , which are both smaller than the photometric zeropoint errors .",
    "note that the magnitudes in the final catalog are not corrected for the galactic extinction .",
    "the final column contains information regarding the crosstalks ; the _ crt _ means that the object is located on a crosstalk position .",
    "we used a dummy value of 99.999 for non - detections . if the object has only single filter data , we used _",

    "to estimate the completeness for each field , we used artificial objects from the ` noao.artdata ` package of iraf .",
