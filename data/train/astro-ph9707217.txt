    "molecular hydrogen has been recognized for a long time to be potentially the most important ( baryonic ) element in the universe ( zwicky 1959 ) , or at least in the galaxy ( gould , gold & salpeter 1963 ) ( see also the review by field et al .  1966 and references therein ) . since the late sixties the availability of millimetric radio - telescopes allowed to find substantial amounts of molecular hydrogen in locations where it can be traced by the co molecule , the molecular clouds . roughly , the indirect detection of molecular hydrogen by the co doubled the known gas content of spirals .    however , in metal poor regions where co can hardly trace h@xmath0 , the question is still open .",
    "most of the mass in the outer , metal poor parts of a galaxy could be very cold h@xmath0 , and remains invisible even today . the present trend to increase the conversion factor @xmath3 between the co intensity and the h@xmath0 mass at decreasing metallicity goes in this direction ( e.g.  sakamoto 1996 ) .    the difficulty to detect the molecule h@xmath0 comes from its symmetry , cancelling any electric dipole moment in the ground state .",
    "this prevents the detection of any radio line in emission , the only ones to be excited from the ground state in the cold interstellar medium ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the first h@xmath0 lines to be detected in emission occur only by quadrupole radiation : they are the pure rotation ones , the first being the @xmath5 at @xmath6 wavelength , already at @xmath7 above the fundamental state , the @xmath8 at @xmath9 and @xmath10 at @xmath11 ( beck et al .  1979 ,",
    "parmar et al .  1994 ) , and @xmath5 ) , and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 , @xmath8 ) , corresponding to an excitation energy of @xmath14 .",
    "these lines trace hot h@xmath0 gas , for example excited in supersonic shocks , which corresponds to an insignificant fraction of the h@xmath0 mass ( e.g.  shull & beckwith 1982 ) .",
    "many recent results obtained with the iso satellite , with the sws instrument sensitive between 2 and 45@xmath15 , have revealed the detection of more than a dozen of these ro - vibrational h@xmath0 lines ( timmermann et al .",
    "these lines are emitted by very dense and warm gas ( @xmath16 ) in shocks , or even hot gas ( @xmath17 ) , that is likely excited non - collisionally through uv pumping ( wright et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the violent starburst arp@xmath18 ,",
    "the h@xmath0 emitting warm gas could represent up to 10% of the ism mass ( sturm et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the only direct information on colder h@xmath0 gas has been gained through far uv absorption in front of stars in the solar neighbourhood by the copernicus satellite ( e.g.  spitzer & jenkins 1975 ) .",
    "unfortunately , only very diffuse clouds could be traced , since high h@xmath0 column densities are associated with large extinctions .",
    "the density ( lower than @xmath19 ) , the molecular fraction ( 0.25 ) and temperature ( @xmath20 ) are typical of diffuse intercloud material .",
    "the dense and much colder molecular cloud bulk component remains to be explored .",
    "in a recent model , we propose that the dark matter detected around spiral galaxies through flat rotation curves , is composed for a substantial part of cold molecular gas , in near isothermal equilibrium with the cosmic background temperature at @xmath21 ( pfenniger et al .",
    "this gas forms a hierarchical structure , possibly a fractal of dimension @xmath22 , spread over more than six orders of magnitude in scale ( @xmath23 down to @xmath24 ) . at the smaller scale ,",
    "the tiniest fragments or `` clumpuscules '' are evolving in the adiabatic regime ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "they have an average density of @xmath25 , a column density of @xmath26 , and a jupiter mass ( @xmath27 ) . their surface filling factor is less than 1% ( simply estimated by the ratio of the average galactic and clumpuscule column densities ) . due to the intrinsic inhomogeneity of the fractal structure , the collision time - scale of the clumpuscules and larger clumps is shorter than their collapse time .",
    "so the envisaged equilibrium is dynamical , constantly renewed collisions in a slight supersonic regime prevent statistically most of the otherwise expected collapses that would lead to jupiter or star formation .",
    "note that the collision speed at the bottom of the hierarchy is of the order of @xmath28 , so `` shocks '' do not imply necessarily strong heating in such conditions .",
    "the frequent collisions mean also that the average temperature and density of the clumpuscules are associated with large fluctuations , the warmer tail of the distribution being just the observed hi .",
    "indeed collisions not only tend to heat by mechanical compression , they also simultaneously _ cool _ by gravitational coupling , an often overlooked effect due to the negative specific heat of gravitating systems . of course in such a model a 100% inefficiency of jupiter or star formation can not be excluded .",
    "however we expect that for the same yet poorly understood reasons that prevent normal molecular clouds to form stars efficiently ( as a naive expectation about collapsing gas would lead to believe ) , similar mechanisms must exist in low excitation regions such as outer galactic disks and malin 1 type galaxies preventing the the fast cooling hi to collapse immediately .",
    "this model explains naturally the evolution of galaxies along the hubble sequence . through gas accretion ,",
    "the dark matter in the outer parts of late - type galaxies is progressively transformed into stars while galaxies evolve towards earlier types .",
    "it also explains the near constant surface density ratio between the hi gas and dark matter in the outer parts of spirals ( bosma 1981 ) . during galaxy interactions ,",
    "some of the cold gas of the outer parts is progressively heated , and accounts for the huge amounts of hot gas detected through x - ray emission in rich galaxy clusters .    with similar argumentation variant models",
    "have also been recently proposed , in which h@xmath0 gas contributes significantly to the dark matter , based mainly in massive proto globular cluster clouds possibly mixed with brown dwarfs ( de paolis et al .",
    "1995 , gerhard & silk 1996 ) . in this case , the cold h@xmath0 gas is not _ very _ cold , but has a temperature between 5 and @xmath29 , which makes it easier to detect in emission .",
    "however , in the mixed model it is hard to see how any substantial fractions of cold gas and brown dwarfs can coexist without virializing rapidly the gas temperature to much higher values than @xmath30 , via dynamical friction and cluster core collapses .",
    "if most of the mass of the galaxy is under the form of molecular gas , are there more or less direct ways to detect it ? in this article , we review several , some novel , possibilities , and try to select the most promising ones . to our knowledge",
    "a similar earlier attempt was made only in the 60 s ( gould & harwit 1963 ) , so the tremendous changes made in between justify a new article on the subject .",
    "we first describe the ultrafine structure of the ortho - h@xmath0 in its ground state , due to the interaction between the nuclear spin ( @xmath31 ) and the magnetic moment induced by the nuclear rotation ( @xmath32 ) , which splits the fundamental in three sublevels ( @xmath33 , 1 and 2 ) .",
    "then we consider trace molecules , formed in the big - bang nucleosynthesis , hd , lih , which could be seen in emission due to their electric dipole rotational transitions , or ions such as h@xmath34 that could be detected through its hyperfine structure .",
    "also , traces of metal enrichment of this quasi - primordial gas could help to detect it through co emission or absorption .",
    "since very cold gas is more likely to be detected in absorption , we evaluate the probability to detect uv absorption lines of h@xmath0 in front of remote quasars .",
    "finally , we discuss the submillimeter continuum emission of very cold dust .",
    "the possibility to trace cold gas through their interaction with cosmic rays and production of gamma rays will be discussed in a subsequent paper in which the highly inhomogeneous gas distribution of the ism will be taken into account .",
    "the hydrogen molecule can be found in two species , the para - h@xmath0 , in which the nuclear spins of the two protons are anti - aligned , and the resulting spin @xmath35 .",
    "then , the spin wave function is anti - symmetric , and the nuclear wave function must be symmetric . since the two electrons are paired in the molecule , their total spin and angular momentum is zero .",
    "the angular momentum of the molecule is then only due to the rotation . in the fundamental state @xmath36 ,",
    "for which there is a symmetric wave - function .    for the ortho - h@xmath0 , on the contrary , the total nuclear spin is @xmath31 , since the spins of the two protons are parallel .",
    "the spin wave function being symmetrical , the nuclear radial wave function must be antisymmetric , by pauli exclusion principle . then , the fundamental state of ortho - h@xmath0 is @xmath32 .",
    "the rotation of the molecule creates a rotational magnetic moment parallel and proportional to the angular momentum @xmath37 , since charged particles ( the protons ) are in rotation .",
    "this rotational moment interacts with the nuclear spin @xmath38 , through an interaction of the form @xmath39 . in other words , this comes from the interaction of @xmath40 , the nuclear spin magnetic dipole , with the magnetic field created from the motion of charges due to rotation . to this interaction",
    ", must be added the spin - spin magnetic interaction for the two nuclei , and the interaction of any nuclear electrical quadrupole moment with the variation of the molecular electric field in the vicinity of the nucleus ( kellog et al .",
    "1939 , 1940 ; ramsey 1952 ) . in negligible external magnetic field ,",
    "the h@xmath0 states can be expressed by the reference basis of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , with @xmath43 .",
    "magnetic dipole transitions are possible for @xmath44 , i.e. , there are two transitions , @xmath45 , and @xmath46",
    ". measurements of these frequencies in the laboratory have been carried out through magnetic resonance on molecular beams ( kolsky et al .",
    "1952 ; harrick & ramsey 1953 ) . the wavelength of these two transitions have been measured at 0.5 and @xmath1 , or more precisely at frequencies of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively for @xmath46 and @xmath45 .",
    "the reason of such a low energy split of the hyperfine structure is due to the only interaction between nuclear momenta .",
    "when the fine structure is due to interaction between electronic momenta , the usual hyperfine structure corresponds to interaction between electronic and nuclear momenta .",
    "the fine structure splitting is then proportional to the bohr magneton @xmath49 squared , where @xmath50 is the electron mass .",
    "the hyperfine structure involves the product of @xmath51 with the nuclear magneton @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the proton mass .",
    "when the interaction involves two nuclear momenta , the splitting is proportional to @xmath54 , i.e.  smaller than the hyperfine structure by roughly a factor @xmath55 .",
    "this could be called ultrafine structure ( cf .",
    "field et al .",
    "1966 ) .",
    "only the ortho - h@xmath0 is concerned by the ultrafine structure .",
    "normal molecular hydrogen gas contains a mixture of the two varieties , with an ortho - to - para ratio of 3 when the temperature is high with respect to the energy difference of the two fundamental states ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "for instance , in the warm h@xmath0 gas detected by iso - sws , an ortho - to - para ratio of 3 is compatible with observations ( wright et al .",
    "1996 ) . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the ortho - to - para ratio must be lower , if the thermodynamical equilibrium can be reached , until all the hydrogen is in para state at @xmath57 .",
    "however , due to the rarefied density of the ism , the ortho - to - para ratio is frozen to the h@xmath0-formation value ( schaefer , private communication ) .",
    "considerable densities are required for the ortho - to - para conversion , which occurs in solid h@xmath0 for instance .",
    "but the fractal gas must be seen as a dynamical structure far out of thermodynamical equilibrium , not only with large density contrasts , but also large temperature contrasts , extending to low temperature the well know inhomogeneous properties of the ism where it can be well observed , i.e.  above about @xmath58 .",
    "the hi is then the warm interface , and h@xmath0 the coldest component , in a mass ratio of about 1 to 10 . by continuity , h@xmath0 forms from hi and vice versa with a rate given by the clump collision time - scale at the scale corresponding to the virial temperature of the transition",
    "this is in any case relatively short : at a scale corresponding to a temperature of @xmath59 , and a fractal dimension @xmath60 , we estimate a duty - cycle time of transformation hi to h@xmath0 of the order of @xmath61 , the cold and warmer phases must be chemically well mixed .",
    "this is an important difference with the alternative cold gas models of de paolis et al .  and",
    "gerhard & silk , were gas clumps , modeled as classical gas blobs , require stability over a substantial fraction of a hubble time .",
    "now the key role in ortho to para conversion in interstellar clouds is the proton exchange reaction ( @xmath62 , cf .",
    "dalgarno et al .",
    "1973 ; gerlich 1990 ) .",
    "this reaction can transform the ortho in a time - scale @xmath63 , if the h@xmath64 ions in dense clouds are essentially due to cosmic ray impacts , with the ionizing flux @xmath65 characteristic of the solar neighbourhood . the corresponding time - scale for a clumpuscule near",
    "the sun is @xmath66 , and the ortho fraction is negligible , but at large distances in the galaxy outskirts , where the cosmic - ray flux is expected to fall exponentially to zero , we can expect a significant part of ortho - h@xmath0 in the cold gas .",
    "on the earth , the ionosphere is reflecting the long wavelength radiations , and this phenomenon is used for radio transmission all over the world ( communications with submarines , for example , can be made through km wavelengths signals ) .",
    "the ionospheric plasma is filtering all frequencies below the plasma frequency @xmath67 .",
    "it is therefore necessary to observe from space .",
    "even from space , the long wavelength radiations are somewhat hindered by interplanetary or interstellar scintillations ( e.g.  cordes et al .",
    "this means , as shown below , that spatial resolution above @xmath68 could not be obtained below @xmath69 .",
    "the plasma frequency in the interstellar medium can be estimated by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the electron density in @xmath72 . since the latter is in average of the order of @xmath73 , the plasma frequency @xmath74 .",
    "radiation of frequencies below that value does not propagate in the medium .",
    "more precisely , since the ism is far from homogeneous , low - frequency radiation propagates in rarefied regions , and is reflected and absorbed by denser condensations . for the kilometric wavelengths that we are interested in , there is no problem of propagation , but the waves are scattered due to fluctuations in electron density .",
    "the electric vector undergoes phase fluctuations , since the index of refraction is @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radiation frequency .",
    "if the ism is modeled by a gaussian spatial distribution of turbulent clumps of size @xmath77 , the scattering angle can be expressed by : @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the total path crossed by the radiation , and @xmath76 is the frequency in hz ( e.g.  lang 1980 ) . at a typical distance of @xmath80 , and for the frequencies considered ( @xmath81 ) ,",
    "the scattering angle is of the order of one degree .",
    "the scintillation problem is therefore severe , and hinders spatial resolution for point sources , but it is still possible to map the galactic disk .",
    "the interplanetary medium produces somewhat less scattering , and the total order of magnitude remains unchanged .",
    "the radiation has a dipole matrix element proportional to @xmath82 ; the line intensity is therefore much weaker than for usual hyperfine transitions ( magnetic dipole in @xmath83 ) . since the spontaneous emission coefficient @xmath84 is proportional to @xmath85 , the life - time of a hydrogen molecule in the upper ultrafine states is much larger than a hubble time : @xmath86 .",
    "it is then likely that the desexcitation is mostly collisional . even at the @xmath21 temperature ,",
    "the upper levels are populated in the statistical weights ratio",
    ". a weak radiation is therefore expected , but the velocity - integrated emission ( @xmath87 ) is ten orders of magnitude less than for the hi line , for the same column density of hydrogen .",
    "the prospects to detect the lines are scarce in the near future , since it would need an instrument of about 6 orders of magnitude increase in surface with respect to nowadays ground - base telescopes ! a solution could be to dispose a grid of cables or array of dipoles spaced by @xmath88 on a significant surface of the moon , e.g.  an area of @xmath89 .",
    "this requirement could be released , however , if there exists strong coherent continuum sources at km wavelengths .",
    "the h@xmath0 ultrafine line could then be detected much more easily in absorption , with presently planned km instruments .",
    "several groups have studied the possibility to observe the sky in the very low frequency domain ( @xmath90 ) ; the most important projects being the nasa low frequency space array ( lfsa ) ( weiler et al .  1988 , 1994 ) , and esa very low frequency array ( vlfa , esa report , sci96 - 002 ) .",
    "these are space projects , since the earth ionosphere is opaque below @xmath91 .",
    "the present projects now consider the possibility either of satellites orbiting the moon , or an array of dipoles on the moon itself , to avoid the strong radio interferences coming from the earth . on the moon",
    ", the hidden far - side surface is favoured , to be completely free of the earth radio emissions .",
    "however , the lunar ionosphere might add some problems , especially on the lunar day , so the observations would confined to the 14 days lunar night .    the limit at low frequency ( @xmath92 ) is fixed by interstellar free - free absorption : the optical depth depends on the emission measure of the medium ( @xmath93 ) and its electron temperature ( @xmath94 ) .",
    "typically , the depth @xmath95 that we can see through the medium below @xmath96 is a function of frequency @xmath76 in mhz : @xmath97 . at the lower frequency @xmath92",
    ", the observations will just cross the galactic plane , and be able to see extragalactic sources .",
    "one can not rely on the clumpy structure of the medium to see through it ( as for dust in the optical domain ) , since the scattering effects of the turbulent plasma broaden any emission to an angle @xmath98 , i.e.  @xmath99 at @xmath92 .",
    "the sensitivity of such arrays depends only on their total surface and filling factor @xmath100 , but not on the receivers quality , since the system temperature is dominated by the sky noise itself ( galactic background radiation , essentially of synchrotron origin ) , which is about @xmath101 at @xmath92 .",
    "arrays of short dipoles ( @xmath102 ) on the moon covering @xmath103 diameter surface are considered , with a filling factor of @xmath104 .",
    "the signal to noise ratio reached in an integration time @xmath105 in a frequency band @xmath106 is then @xmath107 , and can reach @xmath108 in @xmath109 . in other words",
    ", we could detect signals at a few percent of the galactic background within a lunar night .    in front of such an intense galactic background",
    ", the h@xmath0 molecules are absorbing at their line frequency of @xmath92 .",
    "however the optical thickness could be at most @xmath110 in condensed regions , and smoothed to an average of @xmath111 in regions subtended by the effective resolution of @xmath99 .",
    "observations of an absorbing signal will only be possible towards very strong continuum sources such as cas - a , and in any case will be quite difficult .",
    "hd has a weak electric dipole moment , since the proton in the molecule is more mobile than the deuteron ; the electron then does not follow exactly the motion of the positive charge , producing a dipole .",
    "this moment has been measured in the ground vibrational state from the intensity of the pure rotational spectrum by trefler & gush ( 1968 ) : its value is @xmath112 .",
    "the first rotational level is at @xmath113 above the ground level , the corresponding wavelength is @xmath114 .",
    "this line could be only observed in emission from heated regions , and given the very low abundance ratio hd / h@xmath115 10@xmath116 and weak dipole , does not appear as a good tracer of the cold gas .",
    "the lih molecule has a much larger dipole moment , @xmath117 debye ( lawrence et al .  1963 ) , and the first rotational level is only at @xmath118 above the ground level , the corresponding wavelength is @xmath119 ( pearson & gordy 1969 ; rothstein 1969 ) .",
    "the line frequencies in the submillimeter and far - infrared domain have been recently determined with high precision in the laboratory ( plummer et al .",
    "1984 , bellini et al .  1994 ) , and the great astrophysical interest of the lih molecule has been emphasized ( e.g.  puy et al .",
    "a tentative has even been carried out to detect lih at very high redshifts ( de bernardis et al .",
    "this line is unfortunately not accessible from the ground at @xmath120 due to h@xmath0o atmospheric absorption .",
    "this has to wait the launching of a submillimeter satellite , but is a good candidate .",
    "the abundance of lih has been recently estimated to a very low value ( @xmath121 ) in the post - recombination epoch ( stancil et al .",
    "the rate coefficient for lih formation through radiative association is now estimated 3 orders of magnitude smaller than previously ( lepp & schull 1984 ) . in very dense clouds , however , three - body associations reactions have to be taken into account , and most of the lithium turns into molecules ; an order of magnitude for lih abundance is then lih / h@xmath122 , and the optical depth should reach 1 for a column density of @xmath123 , or n(h@xmath124 , in channels of @xmath125",
    ". the line should then be easily detectable in normal molecular clouds , within the optical disk of the galaxy ; the more so as the primordial abundance of li could be increased by about a factor 10 in stellar nucleosynthesis ( e.g.  reeves 1994 ) . in the outer galaxy parts of course ,",
    "the same problems of excitation arise for a very cold gas , and the surface filling factor might be a problem for absorption measurements .",
    "the abundance of the h@xmath34 ion is predicted to be no more than @xmath126 to @xmath127 in chemical models ( e.g.  viala 1986 ) .",
    "but the h@xmath34 ion possesses an hyperfine structure in its ground state , unfortunately in the first rotational level @xmath128 .",
    "the electron spin is 1/2 , and the nuclear spin @xmath31 , which couple in @xmath129 and @xmath130 ; then @xmath131 , @xmath130 and @xmath132 .",
    "five transitions are therefore expected , of which the strongest is @xmath41 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 , at @xmath136 ( sommerville 1965 ; field et al .",
    "1966 ) . at the interface between the cold molecular gas and the interstellar / intergalactic radiation field ,",
    "one can hope to encounter a sufficient column density of h@xmath34 .",
    "the excitation to the @xmath137 level is problematic however .",
    "the usual tracer of molecular hydrogen in the ism is the co molecule , but is valid only for enriched gas , and fails at large distances from galaxy centers .",
    "the abundance [ o / h ] decreases exponentially with radius in spiral galaxies , with a gradient between @xmath138 and @xmath139 ( e.g.  pagel & edmunds 1981 ) , and the n(h@xmath0)/i(co ) conversion ratio is consequently increasing exponentially with radius ( sakamoto 1996 ) .",
    "there could be even more dramatic effects such as a sharp threshold in extinction ( at 0.25 mag ) before co is detectable ( blitz et al .",
    "1990 ) , due to photo - dissociation .",
    "the effect of metallicity on the conversion ratio has long been debated ( e.g.  elmegreen 1989 ) , but strong evidence exists in the magellanic clouds ( rubio et al .",
    "1993 ) , and in nearby dwarf galaxies ( israel , tacconi & baas 1995 ; verter & hodge 1995 ; wilson 1995 ) . the fact that the co line is optically thick does not make it insensitive to metallicity , since the observed size of molecular clouds is related to the @xmath140 surface , and clouds appear much smaller at low metallicity . this fact is often ignored in theoretical models , where clouds or clumps are assumed to have a constant column density with radius ( e.g.  wolfire et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "it is easy to estimate until which radius the dense clouds are likely to contain co molecules , if we estimate that the opacity gradient follows the metallicity gradient . assuming the proportionality relation n(h)@xmath141 between the gas column density and opacity in the solar neighbourhood ( savage et al .  1977 ) , and a column density of @xmath142 for the densest fragments",
    ", their opacity a@xmath143 falls to 0.25 at @xmath144 , but of course the co disappears on large scales before .",
    "another effect hinders the detection of molecular tracers in emission , far from star - formation regions , which is the lack of heating sources .",
    "it is impossible to detect emission from a cloud at a temperature close to the background temperature .",
    "only absorption is possible , although difficult for a surface filling factor of less than 1% .",
    "absorption is biased towards diffuse clouds , or intercloud medium , which has a large filling factor , and a low density ( and therefore a low excitation temperature ) .",
    "this is beautifully demonstrated in the molecular absorption survey of lucas & liszt ( 1994 , 1996 ) in our galaxy : practically all of the absorbing clouds are diffuse ( a@xmath145 ) with a low excitation temperature .",
    "when the gas becomes metal deficient , the diffuse medium is preferentially depleted in molecules , through uv photo - dissociation .",
    "it might still be possible in special environments such as galaxy clusters , to try to detect the cold gas , polluted by the enriched intra - cluster medium .",
    "the problem is to estimate the actual enrichment , based on the gas mixing .",
    "the medium is expected to be multi - phase from theoretical calculations ( e.g.  ferland et al .",
    "1994 ) , and direct euve observations of the @xmath146 gas in the virgo cluster ( lieu et al .",
    "1996 ) support a substantial cooling of the x - ray gas toward cold phases . in the outer parts of the cluster ,",
    "before galaxy interactions have heated the cold gas around individual galaxies , the latter is still cold and metal deficient .",
    "progressively the cold gas is heated and transfered in the hot x - ray emitting phase , where it is metal enriched , at least to the intra - cluster abundance of @xmath147 . in the cluster center , where the density of hot gas is high enough ,",
    "the hot phase becomes unstable to cooling , and generates the cooling flow . since there is no reason why the ubiquitous hierarchical fragmentation observed in the galaxy is not universal",
    ", we must expect that in galaxy cluster gas fragmentation occurs too down to low temperature , small sizes and high densities , i.e.  to molecular clumpuscules ( pfenniger & combes 1994 ) .",
    "this accounts for the apparent complete disappearance of gas in cooling flows , and may explain the high concentration of dark matter in clusters deduced from x - ray data and gravitational arcs ( durret et al .  1994 ; wu & hammer 1993 ) .",
    "many authors have tried to detect this gas in emission or absorption , either in hi ( burns et al .  1981 ; valentijn & giovanelli 1982 ; shostak et al .",
    "1983 ; mcnamara et al .",
    "1990 ; dwarakanath et al .",
    "1995 ) or in the co molecule ( grabelsky & ulmer 1990 ; mc namara & jaffe 1994 ; antonucci & barvainis 1994 ; braine & dupraz 1994 ; odea et al .",
    "maybe the best evidence of the presence of the cooling gas is the extended soft x - ray absorption ( white et al .",
    "although the hi is not detected in emission with upper limits of the order of @xmath148 , it is sometimes detected in absorption , when there is a strong continuum source in the central galaxy .",
    "the corresponding column densities are @xmath149 .",
    "there is also some co emission in perseus a ( lazareff et al .",
    "1989 ) , but which may come from the galaxy itself and not the cooling flow .    to produce the x - ray absorption observed , the gas must have a high surface filling factor ( @xmath150 ) , and a column density of the order of n@xmath151 ( white et al .",
    "the total mass derived is of the order of @xmath152 over a @xmath153 region .",
    "this gas can only correspond to the atomic gas envelope of the denser , low filling factor , molecular clouds .",
    "if the molecular clouds are cold ( @xmath154 ) and condensed ( filling factor @xmath155 ) , it is extremely difficult to detect them , either in emission or in absorption , even at solar metallicity .",
    "the best upper limits reported in the literature ( @xmath156 , average over regions @xmath157 in size , but assuming @xmath158 and solar metallicity , i.e.  the standard @xmath159(co ) conversion ratio , are perfectly compatible with the existence of a huge cold h@xmath0 mass ( the conversion factor tends to infinity when the temperature tends to the background temperature ) .",
    "the hi gas , on the contrary , could give much significant constraints , since it is a warm gas with high filling factor . the column density detected in absorption",
    "are all compatible to what is expected from the cooling flows .",

    "the presence of the x - ray flux introduces a warm ionized interface between the very cold molecular gas and the hot medium .",

    "although its extension coincides with that of the cooling flow , the mass flow involved would be 30 times that of the cooling flow itself .",
    "its detection is therefore not only evidence for a continuous flow of gas cooling from the high virial temperature of the clusters ( 10@xmath166 k ) , but also of possible other heating mechanisms like shocks .",
    "also the detection of the near - infrared quadrupolar emission line h@xmath0(1 - 0)s(1 ) in central cluster galaxies with cooling flows ( and their non - detection in similar control galaxies without cooling flows ) strongly confirms the gas flow as it passes through the temperature of 2000k ( jaffe & bremer 1997 ) .",

    "these conditions , together with the molecular fraction derived @xmath181 and @xmath182 , indicate a diffuse medium .    it should be remarked that only the very low column densities of h@xmath0 can be detected this way , since for moderate to high molecular column densities",

    "if the absorbing clouds belong to an intervening galaxy at high redshift ( @xmath197 ) , the angular size of the obscuring clumpuscules is less than a micro - second , and the effect on the remote quasar would remain un - noticed .",
    "if the absorption comes from our own galaxy , the angular size can be a fraction of an arcsecond , and the optical qso could be entirely covered and obscured . through proper motions of the absorbing globules , at about @xmath198 , this absorption can appear or disappear on scales of one year .",

    "the opacity of the cold component , if interpreted by the same dust emissivity model ( varying with frequency as @xmath206 , is about 7 times that of the warm component .",

    "schaefer ( 1996 ) proposes that the cold dust component detected by cobe / firas might be due in fact to molecular hydrogen emission , as collision - induced dipole transitions : in small very high density fluctuations ( at a fraction of `` amagat '' , i.e.  a density of @xmath207 ) , the h@xmath0 gas can emit a continuum radiation , corresponding to free - bound or free - free transitions of weakly and temporarily bound h@xmath0 molecules , the dimers , and containing a large fraction of ortho - h@xmath0 . by symmetry the para - para complexes",

    "this kind of radiation has been identified in planetary atmospheres during the voyager iris mission ( hanel et al .",

    "the required density then imposes the temperature ( @xmath208 ) , to avoid the transition to solid molecular hydrogen .",
    "already we had remarked that at the present cosmic background temperature of @xmath209 , the average pressure in the h@xmath0 clumpuscules was about 100 times the pressure of saturated vapour , and that probably a small fraction of the molecular mass might be in solid form ( pfenniger & combes 1994 , and several references therein about previous papers discussing the possibility of hiding molecular hydrogen in solid form ) .",
    "snow flakes of h@xmath0 can improve the coupling with the cbr , but the large latent heat of @xmath210 per h@xmath0 molecule and the lack of nucleation sites in metal poor gas may prevent a large mass fraction to freeze out .",
    "the condition of dimerization is then largely satisfied in the physical conditions of the clumpuscules ( @xmath211 , @xmath212 ) , and we expect continuum radiation to be emitted and absorbed by the h@xmath0 collisional complexes , through collision - induced dipole moment .",

    "( 1994 ) that 5 to 25% of the sky brightness in the submillimeter and far - infrared bands is in fact the cibr coming from the integrated light of galaxies . in their model , early - type galaxies at high redshift are highly obscured , and most of their light coming from the intense star - formation phase is re - radiated in the fir .",
    "the cobe data allows a significant fraction of the sky brightness for the cibr , since there is some freedom in the relative contributions of the galaxy and the isotropic backgrounds . in any case , however , the hypothesis of the existence of a cibr does not solve the cold component problem . reach et al .",

    "( 1994 ) , but this did not change their conclusions about the existence of the two components , which temperatures were unaffected .    the basic problem in deriving the exact amount of the cibr contribution is the subtraction of the foreground emission .",
    "another recent interpretation of the cobe / firas data has been put forward by puget et al .",

    "their approach consists in modeling the foreground dust emission according to the dwingeloo recent hi survey ( cf .",

    "the average surface density of hlc s has been estimated by magnani et al .",

    "therefore , no longitude dependence is expected for @xmath236 .",
    "if the neutral warm gas can not be considered to follow the plane parallel geometry locally , i.e.  there is a deficiency of warm dust associated to the hi gas at high latitude , this deficiency could be compensated by a colder medium , emitting only at the lower firas frequencies .",
    "indeed , the long wavelength ( @xmath237 ) emission from cobe / firas does not suffer from this depletion , and follows better the cosecant law .",

    "this range of latitude is not sufficient to reveal a cosecant law , since low column density regions at lower latitudes is not completely sampled ( only the very low column densities are selected at lower latitudes ) .",

    "if the @xmath252 emission of dust is a good pointer towards the dense cold condensations of the orion gmc , they might not indicate the actual h@xmath0 mass , because of large uncertainties in the physics of grains and their true opacities , and also in the actual temperature ( they are determined around @xmath253 from the emission ratio between 870 and @xmath254 ) .",

    "1996 ) ; the constraints are however weak and inconclusive because 0% as well as 100% are still values within the range allowed by the limited statistics of events and a robust estimate of all the errors involved .",
    "cold molecular hydrogen is one of the most appealing candidate ( pfenniger et al .",
    "present observational constraints , when properly assessed , do not rule out this hypothesis .",
    "so we must search for observational tests to constrain or infirm the proposition .",
    "the main difficulty to detect the cold gas in emission is its low temperature , close to the cosmic background temperature .",
    "the detection of the  ultrafine \" structure of the ortho - h@xmath0 molecules at km wavelengths raises considerable difficulties in the near future , but could be eventually a good means to fix the @xmath266(h@xmath0)/@xmath38(co ) conversion ratio in our galaxy . the hd and lih rotational lines are or will be detectable by far - infrared satellites ( iso , first ,  ) , but their excitation energy is too high to trace the bulk of the cold gas .",
    "they could at best trace a perturbed fraction of it . in the same vein",
    ", the hyperfine structure line of h@xmath34 could be observed easily from the ground .",
    "absorption lines detection might be the best way if the gas is indeed very cold . since the surface filling factor of the molecular clumps is low ( @xmath165 ) ,",
    "large statistics are required , but the perspectives are far from hopeless .",
    "h@xmath0 absorption in the lyman and werner bands has already been identified in two damped ly@xmath160 systems . for a clumpuscule falling just on the line of sight of a quasar",
    ", we expect a damped absorption .",
    "it is then impossible to detect the quasar in the optical or uv , but in the near - infrared .",
    "tracer molecules like co in absorption are much less promising due to the low metallicity in addition to the low filling factor .    finally , it is not excluded that the cold dust component detected by cobe / firas ( reach et al .",
    "1995 ) is tracing the cold h@xmath0 component , limited to galactic radii where the cold gas is still mixed with some dust .",
    "this cold component would be already 7 times more massive than the usual warm dusty ism . as predicted by mathis et al .",
    "( 1983 ) , the dense h@xmath0 cores of giant molecular clouds , shielded from the isrf by large opacities , should keep an equilibrium temperature between 5 and @xmath205 .",
    "the fact that this cold medium is still observed at high latitude is not in contradiction with observations of high - latitude molecular clouds , given the large uncertainties in their true h@xmath0 column densities . at high latitude , there could be also a contribution of the cosmic infrared background radiation ; the latter is however negligible in front of the cold component at low latitude .",
    "we are grateful to claude cohen - tannoudji for enlightening discussions about the quantum mechanical treatment of photon - atom interactions , to joachim schaefer for interesting discussions about the h@xmath0 molecule and its dimers , and to dick tipping for advice about far - wing profiles of molecular lines .",

    "in this appendix , we compute the total cross section of the interaction between photons and cold molecular hydrogen , including absorption and scattering .",

    "the finite life - time of the levels implies that they acquire a finite width , of the order of @xmath276 ; the energy of the level can then be represented by @xmath277 . a non perturbative quantum approach exists to compute these photon - molecule interaction amplitudes ( e.g.  weisskopf & wigner 1930 ) .",
    "the amplitude of absorption and scattering has then a pole in @xmath278 .",
    "this introduces an imaginary part , that corresponds to absorption .",
    "we consider only the molecule in its ground state , absorbing a photon to reach the level @xmath272 . to find the cross section",
    ", we must first sum all amplitudes : @xmath279 where @xmath280 is the matrix element of the interaction , which can be considered here dipolar ( @xmath281 ) , since the photon wavelengths are assumed large with respect to the sizes of the molecules .",
    "the probability of transition from the initial to final state is the product of the above amplitude by the density of state , since a discrete level is coupled with a continuum of states ( the photon energy is continuous ) .",
    "the density of states is @xmath282 , which introduces a term @xmath283 as a function of photon frequency @xmath284 ( cf .",
    "cohen - tannoudji et al .",
    "1988 ) . since",
    "the square of the matrix element @xmath285 is proportional to the square of the dipole , and also to @xmath284 , the total cross - section is proportional to @xmath286 ; this dependency is retrieved in the spontaneous emission coefficient ( @xmath287 , and the related @xmath275 ) ; although very close to the resonance , these coefficients are taken as constants , their @xmath284 dependency should be taken back to find the true shape of emission lines , slightly different from the lorentzian shape ( arnous & heitler 1953 ) .",
    "it can be shown that in the vicinity of an electronic dipolar transition , between levels @xmath272 and @xmath288 , the line profile has the shape : @xmath289 where the resonance occurs for @xmath290 ( with corresponding wavelength @xmath291 ) , @xmath292 and @xmath293 are the statistical weights of the transition levels , and @xmath275 is the natural width of the line ( cf .",
    "power & zienau 1959 ) .",
    "the numerator of this expression can be considered as a constant close enough to the resonance , and the classical lorentzian profile is retrieved .    according to the optical theorem ,",
    "the imaginary part of the forward scattering amplitude determines the total cross section for all processes , elastic and inelastic , for a given initial state of the photon ( cf .",
    "for instance landau & lifchitz 1989 ) .",
    "we can consider the absorption cross - section from a stable fundamental state as equal to the total cross section of all possible scattering processes , since in absorbing a quantum , the molecule comes back to its fundamental state after emission of one or several photons .",
    "therefore the total absorption cross - section from the fundamental state , and in the vicinity of resonances , can be written as ( cf .",
    "landau & lifchitz 1989 ) : @xmath294 i.e.  the shape of the diffused line coincides with the natural shape of the spontaneously emitted line .    it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless oscillator strengths @xmath295 , where @xmath50 is the electron mass and @xmath296 is the matrix element of the dipole ( and @xmath297 ) .",
    "the width of each level is computed by summing the probabilities of spontaneous desexcitation to every lower levels : @xmath298 , and the spontaneous rates are expressed by : @xmath299 where @xmath300 is the classical electron radius .",
    "the total cross section can then be expressed in terms of the thomson section @xmath301 : @xmath302    although there does not exist a simple analytical formula valid over the whole frequency range , the cross section is defined through approximations in the three domains of non - resonant , resonant and free ( high frequencies ) . at the low frequency limit @xmath303",
    ", the photon - molecule interaction reduces to the rayleigh diffusion @xmath304 : @xmath305 ^ 2,\\ ] ] and at high energy , the cross section reduces to that of free electrons , @xmath306 , since the electron binding energy is then negligible . at high energy",
    "the cross section is anyway not realistic since the formulae for the ground state ignore ionization and other high - energy effects .      for the summation",
    "we consider all lyman and werner lines , as tabulated in abgrall & roueff ( 1989 ) . since we are concerned only with h@xmath0 molecules initially in their ground state ( @xmath36 , @xmath307 ) , we have considered only @xmath308 transitions ( where @xmath309 ) and tabulated 21 and 7 levels respectively in the lyman and werner bands .",
