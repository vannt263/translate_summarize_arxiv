    "these wind driving mechanisms are also important to study the physical causes for the luminosity limit of evolved stars ( lobel 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath0 cas is a rare bright cool hypergiant , which we are continuously monitoring with high spectral resolution for about a full decade .",

    "the star in 1945 - 47 strong absorption bands of titanium - oxide ( tio ) suddenly appeared in the optical spectrum , together with many low excitation energy lines , not previously observed .",
    "these absorption lines , normally observed in m - type supergiants , were strongly blue - shifted , signaling the ejection of a cool circumstellar gas shell . in july 2000",
    "we observed the formation of new tio bands during a strong @xmath11-brightness decrease by @xmath1@xmath12 ( _ fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "our synthetic spectrum calculations show that @xmath13 decreased by at least 3000 k , from 7250 k to @xmath34250  k , and the spectrum became comparable to the early m - type supergiants @xmath14  cep and betelgeuse .",
    "the tio bands reveal the formation of a cool circumstellar gas shell with @xmath15@xmath164000 k due to supersonic expansion of the photosphere and upper atmosphere .",
    "we observe a shell expansion velocity of @xmath17=35@xmath182  @xmath19 from the tio bands . from the synthetic spectrum",
    "fits to these bands we compute an exceptionally large mass - loss rate of @xmath2@xmath35.4@xmath4@xmath5  @xmath20 , comparable to the values estimated for the notorious outbursts of @xmath8 carinae .",
    "the upper panel of figure  1 shows photo - electric observations of @xmath0 cas in the @xmath11-band ( _ black dots _ ) over the past decade , supplemented with visual magnitude estimates from the @xmath21 , and the @xmath22 ( french association of variable star observers ) during the outburst of late 2000 ( _ red dots _ ) .",
    "the brightness curve shows semi - regular variability , with the deep outburst minimum of @xmath11@xmath1@xmath23 in 2000 september ",

    "the short black vertical lines mark a total of 86 echelle spectra observed with high - resolution spectrographs over the past 10 years .",
    "the spectra have been obtained from our long - term monitoring campaigns with four telescopes in the northern hemisphere ; the utrecht echelle spectrograph of the william herschel telescope ( la palma , canary islands ) , the sofin spectrograph of the nordic optical telescope ( la palma , canary islands ) , the ritter observatory telescope ( oh , usa ) , and the zeiss-1000 telescope of the special astrophysical observatory of the russian academy of science ( zelenchuk , russia ) ( lobel et al .",
    "figure 2 shows dynamic spectra of h@xmath9 , fe  i @xmath105572 , and the split fe  i @xmath105506 line , observed between 1993 and september 2003 .",
    "the white spots in h@xmath9 are emission above the stellar continuum level .",
    "the radial velocity curves of the h@xmath9 absorption , and the photospheric fe  i lines ( _ white dashed lines _ ) reveal a strongly velocity stratified dynamic atmosphere ( lobel et al .",
    "1998 , lobel et al . ,",
    "notice the large blueshift of the fe  i lines during the outburst of mid 2000 .",
    "the outburst is preceded by very strong line emission in the short wavelength wing of h@xmath9 , while the absorption core extends longward ( comparable to an inverse p cygni profile ) , and the fe  i lines strongly shift redward . a strong collapse of the upper h@xmath9 atmosphere and the deeper photosphere precedes the outburst event during the pre - outburst cycle of 1999",
    "( see also _ fig . 1 _ ) .",
    "over the past two years since the outburst we observed an unusually strong inverse p cygni profile in h@xmath9 , indicating a new collapse of @xmath0 cas extended upper hydrogen atmosphere . during the past five months , after the visual brightness maximum of march 2003 ( _ fig . 1 _ ) , we observe how the h@xmath9 line transformed from an inverse p cygni profile into a p cygni profile ( _ fig . 3 _ ) .",
    "the clear p cygni line shape for h@xmath9 is very remarkable because it was not as prominently observed during the 2000 outburst .",
    "it indicates that an even stronger expansion of the upper atmosphere occurred after early 2003 .",
    "we presently ( september 2003 ) measure expansion velocities up to 140  @xmath26 for the h@xmath9 atmosphere , while the stellar spectral type has changed from mid f to early k , based on the recent photospheric spectra .",
    "figure 4 compares high - resolution profiles of the fe  i @xmath105572 line , recently observed with not - sofin in june and september 2003 , with the detailed line shape of july 2000 before the brightness minimum of the outburst .",
    "after the recent brightness maximum of march 2003 we observed that the core of the absorption line strongly shifted toward shorter wavelengths ( _ solid drawn line _ ) .",
    "the line developed a far violet extended absorption wing , which we also observed in the months before the outburst event of 2000 ( _ dash - dotted line _ ) .",
    "the violet line wing signals maximum wind expansion velocities up to @xmath27120 @xmath26 with respect to the stellar rest velocity of @xmath2747 @xmath26 ( _ vertical dotted line _ ) .",
    "more recent observations of september 2003 show however that the core of the photospheric line does not shift further bluewards ( _ dashed line _ ) , as we observed in july 2000 .    from the half - width at half intensity minimum ( hwhm ) of the line we measure that the radial velocity of the photosphere increased from @xmath2757.5 @xmath26 in june 2003 to @xmath2753.5 @xmath26 in september 2003 .",
    "the present collapse indicates that the expansion of the lower photosphere , after the brightness maximum of march 2003 , was not as strong as during the summer of 2000 when the line hwhm assumed @xmath2765.5 @xmath26 .",
    "the visual brightness of @xmath0 cas decreased by about half a magnitude since march 2003 .",
    "the recent spectroscopic observations indicate however that a possible further dimming to a new deep brightness minimum is not expected for the fall and winter of 2003 .",
    "our continuous monitoring programs remain active to further document and investigate the spectral variability of this enigmatic cool hypergiant .",
    "we observe the formation of tio bands in the spectrum of @xmath0 cas before the deep brightness minimum in the outburst of 2000 - 01 .",
    "a supersonic expansion velocity is observed for the new tio bands , while @xmath11 rapidly dims by more than a full magnitude .",
    "a large oscillation cycle and a large brightness maximum , with @xmath13 above 7250 k , precede the outburst minimum .",
    "we compute that @xmath2@xmath35.4@xmath4@xmath5 @xmath28@xmath7 during the event , whereby @xmath13 decreases from @xmath37250 to @xmath163750 k. @xmath13 returns to 5750 k within 100 d after the deep outburst minimum .",
    "since recurrent outbursts occur about every half century in @xmath0 cas , these outburst phases of punctuated enhanced mass - loss are the major mass - loss mechanism of this massive cool hypergiant .",
