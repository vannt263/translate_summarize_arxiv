    "let us begin with huygens diffraction .",
    "huygens diffraction @xcite on a planar surface is expressed as : @xmath5 where , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are planar source and destination surfaces , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the position vectors on the source and destination surfaces , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the wavelength and wave number of light , and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the distance between the source and destination surfaces .",

    "[ fig : system ] , the source surface with arbitrary shape @xmath16 is defined by the displacement @xmath17 at the position @xmath8 . note that when the arbitrary shape surface is uniform - sampled , the corresponding coordinate @xmath8 is non - uniform - sampled depending on the slope of @xmath16 at the position @xmath8 .",
    "huygens diffraction on an arbitrary shape surface is expressed by : @xmath18    @xmath19    here , if the incident wave @xmath20 is used as a planar wave that is perpendicular to the optical axis , the incident wave is expressed as @xmath21 .        applying fresnel approximation to eq.([eqn : r1 ] ) using @xmath22 , we can obtain the following approximation : @xmath23    and , we also approximate @xmath24 in the integral of eq.([eqn : huy_diff2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we obtain fresnel diffraction on an arbitray surface : @xmath25    the above eqs.([eqn : huy_diff2 ] ) and ( [ eqn : fre_diff1 ] ) can be treated an arbitrary shape surface .",
    "we can readily calculate by the direct integral with regard to these equations ; however , the calculation cost is @xmath0 in one dimensional or @xmath1 in two dimensional cases , where @xmath2 is the number of sampling points , because we can not calculate them using fourier transform .    in order to obtain the fourier form of eq.([eqn : fre_diff1 ] ) , we approximate the third exponential term in the integration as follows :    @xmath26    eventually , we obtain the following equation : @xmath27    because the coordinate @xmath8 is sampled by the non - uniform sampling rates , instead of ( uniform ) fourier transform , we can calculate the above equation using non - uniform fourier transform ( nuft ) : @xmath28 } , \\end{aligned } \\label{eqn : fre_diff_nuf}\\ ] ] where , @xmath29}$ ] denotes nuft .",

    "many methods for nufft have been proposed over the course of the past twenty years or so @xcite .",
