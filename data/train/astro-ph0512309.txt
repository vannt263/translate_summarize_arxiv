    "according to modern cosmological ideas , most of the matter in the universe is in the form of so - called cold dark matter , consisting of non - relativistic particles .",
    "the study of the formation of dark matter objects in the universe is based on n - body simulations , which are very time consuming . in this situation",
    ", a simplified approach may become useful , because it allows one to investigate many different variants and to obtain some new principally important features of the problem , which could be lost or not visible during long numerical work .",
    "the systematic analysis of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium is presented in the classical book of @xcite .",
    "different types of incompressible ellipsoids are investigated there on the basis of virial equations , as well as their dynamical and secular stability .",
    "in particular , the points of onset of the bar - mode dynamical and secular instabilities of the maclaurin spheroid , for its transition to the jacobi ellipsoid , are found .",
    "@xcite applied the chandrasechar s virial tensor method for a rotating , self - gravitating spheroid of pressure - free gas and showed the growth of non - axisymmetric perturbations during collapse .",
    "it was also discussed that the slowly shrinking maclaurin spheroid will enter the jacobi series if it shrinks slowly enough for the dissipative mechanisms to be operative .",
    "there have been numerical investigations of collapsing pressureless spheroids in the papers of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of a non - rotating sphere in two dimensions was considered in @xcite , and it was shown that the pressure prevents the development of large - scale shape instability if initially the gravity is more than three - fifths pressure resisted .",
    "there is a wide - ranging review of this topic in the paper of @xcite in memory of chandrasekhar .",
    "subsequent investigations of rapidly rotating figures are connected with stars , and with large - scale structure of the universe . in @xcite the virial equations for rotating riemann ellipsoids of incompressible fluid are demonstrated to form a hamiltonian dynamical system .",
    "there is a detailed description of the ellipsoid model of rotating stars in the papers of @xcite . using a variational principle , they derived and investigated the equations for the evolution of a compressible riemann - s ellipsoid , incorporating viscous dissipation and gravitational radiation .",
    "the solutions of these approximate equations permitted them to obtain equilibrium models , and to investigate their dynamical and secular stability . in a recent paper @xcite secular bar - mode instability driven by viscous dissipation",
    "was investigated , using these equations , and the point of instability of compressible maclaurin spheroids was found .",
    "the modern theory of a large - scale structure is based on the ideas of @xcite , concerning the formation of strongly non - spherical structures during non - linear stages of the development of gravitational instability , known as ` zeldovich s pancakes ' .",
    "numerical simulations for these objects have been performed subsequently by many groups . in the case of structures in dark matter",
    ", we are dealing with non - collisional non - relativistic particles , interacting only by gravitation .",
    "the development of gravitational instability and collapse in dark matter do not lead to any shock formation or radiation losses , but are characterized by non - collisional relaxation .",
    "this relaxation is based on the idea of a ` violent relaxation ' of @xcite .",
    "here we derive and solve the equations for the dynamical behaviour in a simple model of a compressible uniformly rotating ellipsoid .",
    "we derive the equations for axes with the help of variation of the lagrange function of an ellipsoid .",
    "correct description of pressure effects , attained by such an approach , and the addition of relaxation permit us to obtain the dynamics of motion without any numerical singularities . in our model , motion along three axes takes place in the gravitational field of a uniform density ellipsoid , with account of the isotropic pressure , represented in an approximate non - differential way .",
    "relaxation leads to a transformation of the kinetic energy of ordered motion into kinetic energy of chaotic motion , and to increases in the effective pressure and thermal energy .",
    "all losses are connected with runaway particles .",
    "the collapse of the rotating three - axis ellipsoid is approximated by a system of ordinary differential equations , where relaxation and losses of energy , mass and angular momentum are taken into account phenomenologically .",
    "the system is solved numerically for several parameters , characterizing the configuration .",
    "the approach in this work is similar to that used in @xcite , where only dark matter spheroids ( @xmath0 ) were considered . in this case",
    "there are analytical formulae for the gravitational potential and forces . in the description of violent relaxation and different kinds of losses",
    ", we use the same approach as @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we also find the point of the onset of secular instability of a compressible maclaurin spheroid , using the derived dynamical equations , and also from the analysis of the sequence of equilibrium configurations . a simple analytical formula for the point of onset of the bar - mode secular instability of the maclaurin spheroid is found .",

    "let us approximate the density of the matter , @xmath5 , in the ellipsoid as uniform .",
    "the mass @xmath6 and total angular momentum @xmath7 of the uniform ellipsoid are connected with uniform density , angular velocity and semi - axes as ( @xmath8 is the volume of the ellipsoid ) @xmath9 we assume a linear dependence of the velocities on the coordinates in the rotating frame , @xmath10 the gravitational energy of the uniform ellipsoid is defined as @xcite @xmath11 and is expressed in elliptical integrals @xcite .",
    "let us consider a compressible ellipsoid with a constant mass and angular momentum , a total thermal energy of non - relativistic dark matter particles @xmath12 and the relation between pressure @xmath13 and thermal energy @xmath14 as @xmath15 . in absence of any dissipation , this ellipsoid is a conservative system . to derive the equations of motion ,",
    "let us write the lagrange function of the ellipsoid : @xmath16 @xmath17 where the entropy function @xmath18 is constant in the conservative case , but variable in the presence of dissipation , and @xmath19 taking into account the second expression in ( [ mass - moment ] ) , we obtain the relation @xmath20 by variation of the lagrange function we obtain lagrange equations of motion : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23    it is easy to check that the equilibrium solution of these equations are the maclaurin spheroid and the jacobi ellipsoid @xcite .",
    "in reality there is relaxation in the collisionless system , connected with phase mixing , which is called ` violent relaxation ' @xcite .",
    "this relaxation leads to a transformation of the kinetic energy of ordered motion into kinetic energy of chaotic motion and increases the effective pressure and thermal energy .",
    "the main transport process is an effective bulk viscosity .",
    "therefore , there is a drag force , which is described phenomenologically by adding the terms @xmath24 on the right - hand sides of the equations of motions .",
    "here we have scaled the relaxation time @xmath25 by the jeans characteristic time @xmath26 with a constant value of @xmath27 , @xmath28    the process of relaxation is also accompanied by total energy @xmath29 , mass and angular momentum losses from the system .",
    "these losses may be described phenomenologically by characteristic times @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , scaled by @xmath33 with the coefficients @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 :    @xmath37 the corresponding equations describing the various losses are derived for a three - axis ellipsoid in section 4 of the paper by @xcite .    using the variational principle and deriving the equation for the entropy function from energy balance give the correct relations for the pressure and the total energy .",
    "@xcite derived the equations of motion for a rotating ellipsoid from a system of hydrodynamical equations .",
    "however , the accounting for pressure effects in his approach was inconsistent with thermal processes , leading to the wrong results for the dynamical behaviour of a system with radiative losses ( compare with @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "we see that the main changes of these parameters take place at the stages of the first few oscillations : the entropy function @xmath18 increases , the mass @xmath6 and the total energy @xmath29 decreases . than these parameters reach equilibrium values .                    in the second variant of the calculations ( see fig .",

    "we obtain the conservation of the initial configuration .",
    "there are small oscillations around the equilibrium spheroid , during which the difference @xmath83 changes sign periodically . at large angular momentum",
    "we obtain the development of the secular instability , and , after several low - amplitude oscillations , the maclaurin spheroid , is transformed into the jacobi ellipsoid ( see fig . 7 where the variant with large angular momentum is represented ) . because of the absence of relaxation , the system does not reach an equilibrium configuration and oscillations continue . if we include relaxation in this variant , we should observe the final equilibrium state of the ellipsoid .",
    "our calculations allow us to find approximately numerically the point of the onset of the secular instability of a compressible maclaurin spheroid .",
    "it fits well with the analytical results obtained in the next section .",
    "equilibrium of a uniformly rotating figure ( spheroid or ellipsoid ) is found from the equations ( [ ddota])([ddotc ] ) with zero time derivatives :    @xmath89    @xmath90    @xmath91    introducing the variables    @xmath92    and integrals    @xmath93    @xmath94 we can write equations ( [ a])-([c ] ) , using ( [ ddotm ] ) , in the form    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    excluding @xmath6 , we obtain    @xmath98    at @xmath99 , @xmath100 equations ( [ a2 ] ) are identical , and determine the equilibrium of the maclaurin spheroid ( see @xcite ) . for jacobi ellipsoids with @xmath101 , we obtain the following relation between @xmath102 and @xmath103 : @xmath104 this equation has a trivial solution @xmath100 at all @xmath102 , corresponding to the maclairin spheroid .",
    "let us find the bifurcation point of the equation ( [ a3 ] ) , at which non - trivial solutions appear .",
    "while @xmath100 is always a root of equation ( [ a3 ] ) , we may write @xmath105 . an additional root of the equation @xmath106 appears when the root of the equation @xmath107 appears at @xmath100 .",
    "the root of the zero derivative equation @xmath108 at @xmath100 coincides with the root of the equation @xmath109 .",
    "therefore the value of @xmath102 at the bifurcation point is determined by the equation @xmath110 using ( [ vari ] ) and ( [ a3 ] ) , this equation is written in the form    @xmath111    at @xmath100 we have analytic expressions    @xmath112    so that the equation ( [ b4 ] ) is reduced to    @xmath113    taking the integrals @xmath114 and @xmath115 analytically , we have    @xmath116    using ( [ b7 ] ) in ( [ b6 ] ) we obtain the equation    @xmath117    for which the solution @xmath118 determines the bifurcation point at the sequence of the maclaurin spheroids . for the uniform spheroid , the position of this point does not depend on the adiabatic index of the matter .",
    "above , we have obtained the bifurcation point on the equilibrium curve of the maclaurin spheroids using only the equilibrium relations for the jacobi ellipsoids .",
    "the usual way of investigating stability is to solve linearized equations of motion and to find the eigenfrequencies .",

    "it is clear that the position of this point does not depend on the polytropic exponent @xmath127 .",
    "our approximate equations , even without dissipation , describe uniformly rotating ellipsoids ( spheroids ) , which are not connected by adiabatic relations , and contain a `` hidden '' non - conservation of the local angular momentum , which preserves the uniformity . therefore , in the presence of this `` hidden '' non - conservation , the loss of stability takes place exactly at the bifurcation point .",
    "the loss of stability is not connected with relaxation and follows from our equations even in the case when all the global integrals remain constant . in the exact approach",
    ", the instability at this point happens only in the direct presence of dissipative terms @xcite .",
    "the pure adiabatic spheroidal system preserves stability until @xmath128 , where it becomes unstable via a vibrational mode .    in our approach we can not exactly investigate the effect of pure bulk viscosity on the stability of the compressible spheroids , because the transition is influenced by the hidden non - conservation . taking account of bulk viscosity and violent relaxation does not change the bifurcation point . however , in some cases the presence of relaxation has a stabilizing influence on the motion of the system .",
    "we have considered an equilibrium configuration of the maclaurin spheroid close to the bifurcation point , in the interval of the secular instability .",
    "after perturbation of the density , the spheroid starts to oscillate .",
    "our calculations have shown that in the absence of relaxation the development of instability and the transition of the spheroid to a three - axis object both occur . in the presence of relaxation",
    "the perturbed spheroid remains a spheroid and the system reaches the equilibrium state .",
    "this behaviour takes place because during relaxation the thermal energy increases , and the eccentricity @xmath129 decreases and comes into the interval of stability .",
    "so the spheroid initially perturbed in the interval of instability , not far from the bifurcation point , becomes stable due to the processes of relaxation .",
    "according hypothesis of @xcite , the stability of an isolated axially symmetric system is determined by the ratio @xmath130 .",
    "they determined from numerical experiments the critical value for various configuration as @xmath131 .",
    "@xcite found that compressible spheroids become secularly unstable to triaxial deformations at the bifurcation point , where @xmath132 , independent of @xmath127 .",
    "our formula gives exactly the same result , which is also confirmed by our numerical simulations .",
    "as noted above , this result remains valid also in the presence of dissipation .",
    "we have investigated the dynamics of a three - axis dark matter ellipsoid .",
    "the equations of motion for the axes of a uniform compressible ellipsoid have been obtained by variation of the lagrange function , in which violent relaxation and losses of matter , energy and angular momentum have been included phenomenologically .",
    "the system was solved numerically , until the formation of stationary rotating figures in the presence of relaxation . for lower angular momentum @xmath7",
    "we have the formation of a compressed spheroid , while at larger @xmath7 we follow the development of a three - axial instability and the formation of a three - axial ellipsoid .",
    "the instability in this approximation happens at the bifurcation point of the sequence of maclaurin spheroids , where the jacobi ellipsoidal system starts .",
    "the bifurcation point coinciding with the point of loss of stability is found analytically in the form of a simple formula , by static and dynamic approaches .",
