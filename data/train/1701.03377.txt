    "purely hydrodynamic or magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) flows driven by a volume force in three dimensional periodic boxes have a long history in the study of fundamental properties of turbulence and magnetic field generation . under the assumption that there are universal features in turbulence independent of the shape of distant boundaries ,",
    "spatially periodic models should allow us to study those features conveniently .",
    "body forces are frequently used to model the effect of actual boundaries , such as moving propellers , which are too cumbersome to simulate in full . while this problem is mostly rooted in engineering",
    ", it has also become of interest in mhd research because of laboratory dynamo experiments in which liquid metal is forced by a moving boundary more easily represented by a volume force in numerical simulations intended to design or reproduce the experiments ( as for example in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , some mechanisms to drive flows in geo- or astrophysics involve a volume forcing if observed in the appropriate frame of reference , such as precession or tides @xcite .",
    "even the numerically convenient setting of a flow in a periodic box overstrains computational possibilities if reynolds numbers get too large .",
    "exact analytical solutions for turbulent flows are unknown , but techniques are known to determine at least upper bounds for certain quantities .",
    "this approach is frequently called optimum theory .",
    "these techniques have been applied to several idealized flows , notably couette flows and convection in plane layers , and also to mhd problems ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these bounds were obtained by using either a background field technique going back to hopf @xcite and doering and constantin @xcite , or by using an optimization procedure introduced by howard @xcite and later on championed by busse @xcite , mostly in the context of convection .",
    "both of these methods rely on the presence of boundaries where boundary conditions restrict admissible fields , and are not useful in a periodic domain .",
    "the results presented here for dynamos draw on the work for non - magnetic flows in periodic boxes by doering and foias @xcite ( see also @xcite ) who formulate bounds in as general terms as possible .",
    "the present paper proceeds by way of example and studies a periodic flow introduced by g.o . roberts @xcite , but the procedure is applicable to general forcing . the g.o .",
    "roberts flow has served as paradigm for numerous problems @xcite and resembles qualitatively the helical flows generated by convection in rotating systems .",
    "the model which will be considered here is a three dimensional periodic box driven by a force density such that the flow assumed in the g.o .",
    "roberts dynamo is a solution of the navier - stokes equation with that forcing . in general",
    ", this flow is unstable .",
    "if magnetic field growth sets in , the most important question is at which amplitude the field will saturate .",
    "this issue was already tackled with the tools of weakly nonlinear analysis @xcite .",
    "far from onset , dimensional or heuristic arguments are necessary @xcite .",
    "heuristics are always uncertain , and dimensional arguments face the problem that more than one length scale ( different periodicity lengths in different directions ) or more than one velocity scale ( the kinetic velocity and the alfvn velocity ) may be available to form expressions with certain prescribed units .",
    "optimum or bounding theory on the other hand is rigorous , but has a mixed record regarding its performance in approximating or tightly bounding the quantity of interest .",
