    "one of the most intriguing topic in coding theory is the problem of bounding the probability of error of optimal codes at low rates .",
    "while at high rates the asymptotic behaviour of the probability of error for optimal codes is now very well understood , very little is known in the low rate region .",
    "shannon @xcite introduced the notion of channel capacity @xmath4 , which represents the largest rate at which information can be sent through the channel with probability of error that vanishes with increasing block - length .",
    "he then also introduced @xcite the notion of zero - error capacity @xmath5 as the largest rate at which information can be sent with probability of error precisely equal to zero . for rates in the range @xmath6 , the probability of error",
    "is known to decrease exponentially in the block - length @xmath7 as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so called reliability function of the channel .",
    "both determining @xmath9 for small @xmath10 and even determining @xmath5 is an unsolved problem and only upper and lower bounds for these quantities are known .",
    "lovsz gave an important improvement in upper bounding @xmath5 by means of his @xmath11 function , thus enlarging the range of values over which @xmath9 is known to be finite .",
    "however , lovsz s result was never exploited to find actual bounds to @xmath9 for rates @xmath10 immediately above @xmath11 .    in this paper",
    "we propose a first attempt to bound the probability of error at rates @xmath12 by combining lovsz s method with the idea used by gallager in the development of his expurgated bound .",
    "even if the proposed approach does not lead yet to good bounds to the reliability function , we believe it sheds some light on this relatively unexplored topic .",
    "let @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , be the transition probabilities of a discrete memoryless channel @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are finite sets . for a sequence @xmath19 and a sequence @xmath20 ,",
    "the probability of observing @xmath21 at the output of the channel given @xmath22 at the input is @xmath23 a block code with @xmath24 messages and block - length @xmath7 is a mapping from a set @xmath25 of @xmath24 messages onto a set @xmath26 of @xmath24 sequences in @xmath27 . the rate @xmath10 of the code is defined as @xmath28 .",
    "a decoder is a mapping from @xmath29 into the set of possible messages @xmath25 .",
    "if message @xmath30 is to be sent , the encoder transmits the codeword @xmath31 through the channel .",
    "an output sequence @xmath21 is received by the decoder , which maps it to a message @xmath32 .",
    "an error occurs if @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath34 be the set of output sequences that are mapped into message @xmath30 . when message @xmath30 is sent , the probability of error is @xmath35 the maximum error probability of the code is defined as the largest @xmath36 , that is , @xmath37    let @xmath38 be the smallest maximum error probability among all codes of length @xmath7 and rate at least @xmath10 .",
    "theorem @xcite states that sequences of codes exist such that @xmath39 as @xmath40 for all rates smaller than a constant @xmath4 , called _",
    "channel capacity_. for @xmath41 , shannon s theorem only asserts that @xmath39 as @xmath40 . for a range of rates @xmath42 , the optimal probability of error @xmath38",
    "is known to have an exponential decrease in @xmath7 , and it is thus useful to define the _ reliability function _ of the channel as @xmath43 the value @xmath5 is the so called _ zero - error capacity _ , also introduced by shannon @xcite , which is defined as the highest rate at which communication is possible with probability of error precisely equal to zero .",
    "more formally , @xmath44 for @xmath45 , we may define the reliability function @xmath9 as being infinite .",
    "note that @xmath46 if and only if there are at least two input symbols @xmath47 and @xmath48 which are not confusable at the output , meaning that @xmath49 is zero for all values of @xmath50 . determining the reliability function @xmath9 ( at low positive rates ) and the zero - error capacity @xmath5 of a general channel is still an unsolved problem .",
    "one of the most famous results in this direction is lovsz s upper bound to @xmath5 .",
    "lovsz proves that @xmath5 is upper bounded by a quantity @xmath11 defined as @xmath51 where @xmath52 runs over all sets of unit norm vectors in any hilbert space such that @xmath53 and @xmath54 are orthogonal if symbols @xmath47 and @xmath48 are not confusable and @xmath55 runs over all unit norm vectors . here",
    ", @xmath56 denotes conjugate transpose and @xmath57 is the scalar product between @xmath58 and @xmath59 .      here",
    ", we briefly recall some important connections between the reliability function @xmath9 and the bhattacharyya distance between codewords .",
    "this connection is of great importance since the bhattacharyya distance between distributions is related to a scalar product between unit norm vectors in a hilbert space .",
    "it is this property that creates an underlying common substrate for lovsz s approach and for bounding the reliability function .    for a generic input symbol @xmath47 ,",
    "consider the unit norm @xmath60-dimensional column vector @xmath61 with components @xmath62 .",
    "we call this the _ state vector _ of input symbol @xmath47 , in analogy with the input signals of pure - state classical - quantum channels ( see comment at the end of section [ sec : connections ] ) . in the same way , for an input sequence @xmath63 , consider the unit norm @xmath64-dimensional column vector @xmath65 whose components are the values @xmath66 , that is , @xmath65 is simply the element - wise square root of the conditional output distribution given the input sequence @xmath22 . then , since the channel is memoryless , we can write @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the kronecker product . let for ease of notation @xmath69 be the state vector of the codeword @xmath31 ; then we can represent our code @xmath26 by means of their associated state vectors @xmath70 . since all square roots are taken positive , note that our channel has a positive zero - error capacity if and only if there are at least two state vectors @xmath61 , @xmath71 such that @xmath72 .",
    "this implies that codes can be built such that @xmath73 for some @xmath30 , @xmath74 , that is , the two codewords @xmath30 and @xmath74 can not be confused at the output .",
    "however , the scalar product @xmath75 plays a more general role since it is related to the so called bhattacharyya distance between the two codewords @xmath30 and @xmath74 .",
    "in particular , in a binary hypothesis testing between codeword @xmath30 and @xmath74 , an extension of the chernoff bound allows to assert that the minimum error probability asymptotically satisfies @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 means equivalence to the first order in the exponent . for @xmath78 ,",
    "the sum above obviously equals @xmath75 .",
    "it is easily shown that the minimum above is always between @xmath79 and @xmath75 , and it equals the latter for a class of channels , called pairwise reversible channels , that have some symmetry with respect to the input symbols . ]",
    "obviously , for a given code , the probability of error @xmath80 is lower bounded by the probability of error in each binary hypothesis test between two codewords .",
    "hence , we find that @xmath80 asymptotically satisfies @xmath81 where the coefficient 2 can be removed if the channel is pairwise reversible .",
    "it is thus obvious that it is possible to upper bound @xmath9 by lower bounding the quantity @xmath82 lovsz s work aims at finding a value @xmath11 as small as possible that allows to conclude that , for a set of @xmath83 codewords , @xmath84 can not be zero , and thus at least two codewords are confusable . here , instead , we want something more , that is , finding a lower bound on @xmath84 for each code with rate @xmath12 so as to deduce an upper bound to @xmath9 for all @xmath12 .",
    "consider the scalar products between the channel state vectors @xmath85 . for a fixed @xmath86 , consider then a set of `` tilted '' state vectors , that is , unit norm vectors @xmath87 in any hilbert space such that @xmath88 .",
    "we call such a set of vectors @xmath87 an _ orthonormal representation of degree @xmath1 _ of our channel , and call @xmath89 the set of all possible such representations + @xmath90 observe that @xmath89 is non - empty since the original @xmath91 vectors satisfy the constraints",
    "value _ of an orthonormal representation is the quantity @xmath92 where the minimum is over all unit norm vectors @xmath93 .",
    "the optimal choice of the vector @xmath93 is called , with lovsz , the handle of the representation .",
    "we call it @xmath93 to point out that this vector plays essentially the same role as the auxiliary output distribution @xmath94 used in the sphere - packing bound of @xcite . due to space limitation",
    ", we can not discuss this detail here ; see the comment at the end of section [ sec : connections ] . call now @xmath0 the minimum value over all representations of degree @xmath1 ,",
    "@xmath95    we have the following result .    for any code of block - length @xmath7 with @xmath24 codewords and any @xmath86 we have @xmath96 [ th ]    for the reliability function of a general dmc we have the bound @xmath97 where the coefficient 2 can be removed if the channel is pairwise reversible .",
    "[ coroll ]    for an input sequence @xmath63 call , in analogy with , @xmath98 .",
    "observe first that , for any two input sequences @xmath22 and",
    "@xmath99 , we have @xmath100 furthermore , note that , for an optimal representation of degree @xmath1 with handle @xmath93 , we have @xmath101 , @xmath102 . set now @xmath103 .",
    "we then have @xmath104 let us first check how lovsz s bound is obtained .",
    "lovsz s approach is to bound the number @xmath24 of codewords with orthogonal state vectors , using the property that if @xmath105 form a set of orthonormal vectors , then @xmath106 hence , if @xmath107 , there are at least two non - orthogonal vectors in the set , say @xmath108 . but",
    "this implies that @xmath109 .",
    "hence , if @xmath110 , no zero - error code can exist .",
    "we still have the freedom in the choice of @xmath1 and it is obvious that larger values of @xmath1 can only give better results .",
    "hence , it is preferable to simply work in the limit of @xmath111 and thus build the representation @xmath112 under the only constraint that @xmath113 whenever @xmath114 .",
    "this gives precisely lovsz result .",
    "now , instead of bounding @xmath10 under the hypothesis of zero - error communication , we want to bound the probability of error for a given @xmath110 . considering the tilted state vectors of the code , we can rewrite equation as @xmath115 the second expression above has the benefit of easily allowing averaging this expression over different codewords .",
    "so , we can average this expression over all @xmath30 and , defining the matrix @xmath116 , we get @xmath117 since @xmath118 is a unit norm vector , this implies that the matrix @xmath119 has at least one eigenvalue larger than or equal to @xmath120 .",
    "this in turn implies that also the matrix @xmath121 has itself an eigenvalue larger than or equal to @xmath120 , that is @xmath122 it is known that for a given matrix @xmath123 with elements @xmath124 , the following inequality holds @xmath125 using this inequality with @xmath126 , since @xmath127 , we get @xmath128 where the last step is due to the jensen inequality , since @xmath86 . extracting the sum from this inequality we obtain the inequality stated in the theorem .    to prove the corollary , simply note that @xmath129 the bound is trivial if @xmath130 . for @xmath110 , instead",
    ", the second term in the parenthesis decreases exponentially faster than the first , which leads us to the conclusion that @xmath131 the bounds in terms of @xmath9 are then obtained by simply taking the limit @xmath40 and using the bound .",
    "we close this section with a comment on the computation of the function @xmath0 .",
    "there is no essential difference with respect to the evaluation of the lovsz theta function . the optimal representation @xmath87 for any fixed @xmath1 , can be obtained by solving a semidefinite optimization problem . if we consider the @xmath132 gram matrix @xmath133^\\dagger[\\tilde{{\\bm{\\psi}}}_1,\\ldots,\\tilde{{\\bm{\\psi}}}_k , { \\bm{f}}]\\ ] ]",
    "we note that finding the optimal representation amounts to solving the problem @xmath134 the solution to this problem is @xmath135 and both the representation vectors @xmath87 and the handle @xmath93 can be obtained by means of the spectral decomposition of the optimal @xmath136 found .",
    "a first important comment abount @xmath0 concerns the result obtained for @xmath137 ; the value @xmath138 is in fact simply the cut - off rate of the channel . indeed , for @xmath137",
    ", we can without loss of generality use the obvious representation @xmath139 , since any different optimal representation will simply be a rotation of this ( or an equivalent description in a space with a different dimension ) . in this case , all the components of all the vectors @xmath87",
    "are non - negative and this easily implies that the optimal @xmath140 can as well be chosen with non - negative components , since changing a supposedly negative component of @xmath93 to its absolute value can only improve the result .",
    "thus , @xmath93 can be written as the square root of a probability distribution @xmath141 on @xmath142 , and we have @xmath143 where the minimum is now over all probability distributions @xmath141 . as observed by csiszr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 1 , with @xmath144 ) , this expression equals the cut - off rate @xmath145 of the channel defined as @xmath146 another important characteristic of the function @xmath0 is observed in the limit @xmath147 . in the limit , the only constraint on the representations is that @xmath113 whenever @xmath114 .",
    "hence , when @xmath147 , the set of possible representations is precisely the same considered by lovsz @xcite , and we thus have @xmath148 as @xmath111 .",
    "so , the value of @xmath0 moves from the cut - off rate @xmath145 to the lovsz bound @xmath11 when @xmath1 varies from @xmath2 to @xmath3 .",
    "this clearly implies that the bound of corollary [ coroll ] is finite for all @xmath12 and thus it allows to bound the zero - error capacity of the channel as @xmath149    in general , the function @xmath0 turns out to be strongly related to the coefficient @xmath150 used in the expurgated bound of gallager @xcite and defined , using our definition of @xmath151 , as @xmath152.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] in order to present this relation , it is instructive to consider first the so called _ non - negative definite _ channels as defined by jelinek @xcite .",
    "these are channels for which the matrix @xmath153 with @xmath154 element @xmath155 is positive semidefinite for all @xmath86 .",
    "for example , the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) is non - negative definite .",
    "it was proved by jelinek that , for these channels , the expurgated coefficient @xmath156 computed over the @xmath7-fold extensions of the channel ( and normalized to @xmath7 ) has the same value as @xmath150 .",
    "it is also known that for these channels , the inputs can be partitioned in subsets such that all pairs of symbols from the same subset are confusable and no pair of symbols from different subsets are confusable .",
    "the zero error capacity in this case is simply the logarithm of the number of such subsets . for these channels , since the matrix @xmath153 is positive semidefinite , there exists a set of vectors @xmath157 such that @xmath158 , that is , for all @xmath159 , representations of degree @xmath1 exist that satisfy all the constraints with equality . in this case , the equivalence with the cut - off rate that we have seen for @xmath137 can be in a sense extended to other @xmath1 values .",

    "thus , it is seen that that bound is loose in general .",
    "it is however somehow tight in the sense that , in this particular case , @xmath166 ( which is however trivial ) and , if @xmath167 , the bound gives @xmath168 where @xmath169 is gallager s expurgated lower bound to @xmath9 .",
    "if the channel is pairwise reversible , this can then be improved to @xmath170 , which is obviously tight .    for general channels with a non - trivial zero - error capacity , like for example any channel",
    "whose confusability graph is a pentagon , what happens is that the matrix @xmath153 is in general positive semidefinite only for values of @xmath1 in a range @xmath171 $ ] and then it becomes not positive semidefinite for some @xmath172 .",

    "more generally , if @xmath175 , @xmath176 , since @xmath0 is given by equation , it is an upper bound to and thus to @xmath174 .",
    "it can then also be proved that is multiplicative , in this case , over the @xmath7-fold tensor power of the representation @xmath177 .",
    "this implies that , for all @xmath7 , @xmath0 is an upper bound to the ( normalized ) expurgated bound @xmath178 computed for the @xmath7-fold memoryless extension of the channel .",

    "is is worth pointing out that , for some channels , the optimal representation may even stay fixed for @xmath1 larger than some given finite value @xmath181 and @xmath0 is thus constant for @xmath182 ( in this case , the bounds are useless for @xmath183 ) .",
