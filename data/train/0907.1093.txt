    "in the last two decades , surveys in the far - infrared and sub - millimetre have revolutionised our understanding of galaxy evolution in the high - redshift universe .",
    "these surveys , primarily at wavelengths around 850@xmath3 ( e.g. @xcite ) , 1100@xmath3 @xcite , and 1200@xmath3 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have shown that the contribution to the comoving ir energy density from sub - mm bright galaxies ( smgs ) increases by approximately three orders of magnitude in going from the local universe to @xmath6 , and that @xmath6 smgs are responsible for a significant portion the extragalactic infrared background light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "initial followup studies have identified optical counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and measured redshifts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) of many smgs .",
    "further studies have shown that smgs harbour very high rates of star formation , often accompanied by significant agn activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and that at least some are involved in ongoing mergers @xcite , implying that smgs signpost massive galaxy assembly in the high redshift universe .",
    "reviews of their properties can be found in @xcite and @xcite .    on a fundamental level ,",
    "smgs represent the efficient transformation of free baryons into stars and black holes .",
    "recent work has therefore focused on understanding how smgs relate to the cosmological evolution of the total and baryonic mass density .",
    "evidence suggests that this relationship is complex , with an intricate dependence on variables such as redshift , local environmental richness , and halo merger history .",
    "accordingly , observations must find smgs across a wide range of environments and redshifts .",
    "this has traditionally proven difficult ; smgs are easy to find across wide redshift ranges due to the favourable k - correction at sub - mm wavelengths , but hard to find across wide ranges in environment due to the inability of most sub - mm bolometer arrays to efficiently map large areas of sky . constraints on smg number counts have thus been limited by both sample size and cosmic variance , we have found relatively few of the brightest and rarest smgs , and constraints on smg clustering  an important tool in relating smgs to the underlying dark matter distribution",
    "are weak ( ( e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , see also @xcite ) . as a result , many studies have adopted a two - pronged approach ; using modest sized blank field surveys to constrain the properties of the general smg population , combined with targeted surveys of clusters to probe the properties of smgs in the highest density regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "even this approach has drawbacks though , as it requires a pre - existing cluster catalogue extending to redshifts significantly in excess of unity , where clusters are difficult to find .",
    "this situation has recently been improved by both the combined analysis of multiple surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and by the advent of larger area sub - mm surveys such as the 850@xmath3 scuba / shades survey @xcite , which mapped 0.2deg@xmath0 to depths of @xmath7mjy . in this paper , we present a further step forward in understanding the smg population through the 1100@xmath3 aztec / shades survey , which covers 0.5deg@xmath0 to depths of @xmath8mjy and over 0.7deg@xmath0 in total .",
    "this survey dramatically improves our understanding of the 1100@xmath3 blank - field population , with previous 1100@xmath3 surveys being smaller in area ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shallower ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or containing known biased regions in their survey volumes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "details of the aztec observations are given in section  [ sec : observations ] , and we present the 1100@xmath3 maps and source catalogues in section  [ sec : maps ] .",
    "detailed constraints on the 1100@xmath3 blank - field number counts are derived in section  [ sec : counts ] , and we compare these results to those derived from other surveys and models in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , our conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we assume a flat @xmath9cdm cosmology with @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12  km  s@xmath13  mpc@xmath13 .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of papers using the aztec / shades maps and catalogues to study the sub - millimetre population of galaxies .",
    "we have completed the scuba half - degree extragalactic survey ( shades ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by mapping over one - half square degree of sky using the aztec 1.1mm camera @xcite mounted on the 15-metre james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) . the aztec / jcmt system results in a gaussian beam with @xmath14arcsec .",
    "the shades survey is split between the lockman hole east field ( lh ; 10@xmath1552@xmath16 , @xmath1757@xmath1800@xmath19 ) and the subaru / xmm - newton deep field ( sxdf ; 02@xmath1518@xmath16 , @xmath2005@xmath1800@xmath19 ) .",
    "aztec has mapped over 0.7deg@xmath0 to 1.1 mm depths of 0.91.7mjy between the lh and sxdf fields , including the central 0.13 and 0.11deg@xmath0 , respectively , mapped by scuba at 850@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "all aztec / shades observations were carried out between november 2005 and january 2006 , with over 180 hours of telescope time dedicated to this project , including all overheads .",
    "the aztec / shades observing strategy is similar to that used for other aztec blank - field surveys at the jcmt and is described in detail in previous publications @xcite .",
    "all observations were made while scanning the telescope in elevation in a raster pattern ( see @xcite ) .",
    "initially , the aztec / shades observations were made as small 15arcmin @xmath21 15arcmin mosaic maps with scan speeds of 90120arcsecs@xmath13 .",
    "later observations were extended to cover an entire field in one continuous observation of size 35arcmin @xmath21 35arcmin , which served to reduce observational overheads .",
    "faster scan speeds of 180220arcsecs@xmath13 were used for these longer scans , which increased the effective sensitivity of the observations due to the corresponding reduction in residual atmospheric noise at the higher temporal frequencies @xcite .",
    "after full reduction , the larger maps with faster scan - speeds have an observing efficiency of @xmath22 150  per cent , relative to the smaller maps .",
    "in the end , 46 ( 63 ) mosaic maps and 65 ( 34 ) full maps were used to create the final lh ( sxdf ) map .",
    "these observations were performed over a wide range of atmospheric conditions and elevations .",
    "figure  [ fig : mapping_speed ] shows both the achieved mapping speeds and the cumulative distribution of observation time as a function of effective opacity at 225ghz .",
    "nightly overhead observations included focusing , load curves , beam maps and pointing observations , all of which are described in the aztec instrument paper @xcite . pointing observations of bright point sources ( typically @xmath23jy ) that lie near the science field",
    "being targeted were made every two hours .",
    "these measurements provide small corrections to the jcmt pointing model and are applied using a linear interpolation between the nearest pointing measurements taken before and after each science observation .",
    "flux calibration is performed as described in @xcite using the nightly load curves and beam maps of our primary calibration source , uranus . the error in flux calibration",
    "is estimated to be 613  per cent on an _ individual _ observation @xcite .",
    "the actual error in the final co - added aztec / shades maps , which comprise observations spanning many nights and calibrations , will be smaller , assuming the calibration uncertainty is randomly distributed .",
    "these individual error estimates do not include the systematic 5  per cent absolute uncertainty in the flux density of uranus @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe the methods used to construct the 1.1mm maps and source catalogues .",
    "we test the astrometry and calibration of our maps against complementary radio data .",
    "we also describe expanded and improved methods for estimating and correcting for flux biases inherent to these surveys and test these estimates against simulations .",
    "the time streams of each observation are cleared of intermittent spikes ( e.g. cosmic - ray events , instrumental glitches ) and have the dominant atmospheric signals removed using the techniques described in @xcite . each observation",
    "is then mapped to a 3arcsec @xmath21 3arcsec grid in ra - dec that is tangent to the celestial sphere at ( 10@xmath1551@xmath1659@xmath24 , @xmath2521@xmath1943@xmath26 ) for lockman hole and ( 02@xmath1518@xmath1601@xmath24 , @xmath2759@xmath1954@xmath26 ) for sxdf .",
    "these are the same pixel sizes and tangent points used for the scuba / shades 850@xmath3 maps , allowing for straightforward comparison of maps in upcoming shades publications .",
    "all observations are then ` co - added ' on the same grid to provide a weighted - average signal map and weight map for each field .    in parallel , we pass a simulated point source ( as defined through beam map observations ) through the same algorithms to trace and record the effective psf , or ` point source kernel ' , in our final maps .",
    "we also create five noise - only map realisations of each observation by jack - knifing ( randomly multiplying by @xmath28 or @xmath29 ) each scan ( 515 seconds of data ) of the time stream .",
    "this process works to remove any astronomical signal while preserving the dominant noise properties in the map . ) , as confirmed through simulation . ] .",
    "the resulting jack - knifed maps are dominated by residual atmospheric contamination and detector noise .",
    "one - hundred fully co - added noise maps are then created by randomly selecting a noise realisation for each observation and calculating the weighted average in the same manner used to create the co - added signal maps . because the atmospheric contamination and the detector noise are uncorrelated amongst the full set of maps , the resulting co - added noise maps are , like the underlying noise in the signal map , extremely gaussian .",
    "an optimal point source filter is applied to our maps utilising the information contained within the point source kernel and noise map realisations .",
    "the filtering techniques used are described in detail in previous aztec publications @xcite .",
    "the resulting aztec signal - to - noise maps of lockman hole and sxdf are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : maps ] .",
    "the thick dashed contour of each map depicts the 50  per cent coverage level , representing a uniformly - covered region that has a noise level within @xmath30 of that found in the deep central region of that map and beyond which the survey depth drops off sharply  a consequence of the particular observation modes employed .",
    "the aztec / shades maps are trimmed at this 50  per cent coverage level  as defined by the co - added weight map described above  for all analysis in the following sections .",
    "the trimmed maps have total sizes of 0.31deg@xmath0 and 0.37deg@xmath0 for lh and sxdf , respectively , and correspond to depths of @xmath31mjy and @xmath32mjy .",
    "the sxdf map is larger and shallower than that of lockman hole due to an observation script error that led to some individual maps being offset in declination .",
    "we continued to observe the resulting extended sxdf region after discovery of the error in order to maximise the usefulness of our entire data set .",
    "the optimal filter is also applied to the co - added point source kernel and noise maps in order to provide the best model of the point source response and accurate estimates of the noise properties in our final maps . as shown for previously published aztec / jcmt maps @xcite , these noise - only maps confirm a highly gaussian nature of the underlying noise in the aztec / shades data ( see figure  [ fig : hist ] ) .",
    "accurate representations of the filtered point source kernel and the noise properties of the maps are critical components of the simulations described throughout this paper .",
    "we have checked the astrometric accuracy of the aztec / shades maps by stacking ( i.e. averaging ) the aztec flux at the positions of radio sources in these fields ( techniques described in detail in @xcite ) .",
    "we use a re - reduction of the archival vla 1.4ghz continuum data in the lockman hole field @xcite to generate a catalogue of radio sources in the aztec / lh field and we utilise the 100@xmath33jy catalogue of @xcite in the aztec / sxdf field .",
    "these catalogues result in stacked detections of significance 11@xmath34 and 7@xmath34 for aztec / lh and aztec / sxdf , respectively .",
    "the stacked data are consistent with no systematic astrometric offset in either map with the possible exception of a small offset in declination , @xmath35 arcsec , in the aztec / sxdf field . due to the low significance and relatively small size of this potential offset ,",
    "no correction is applied to the map .",
    "we can also constrain the random astrometric errors across the aztec maps by measuring the broadening of the stacked signal compared to the aztec point - source response ( see * ? ? ?",
    "this broadening suggests that the random radial pointing error rms is @xmath36arcsec for both fields .",
    "broadening of the stacked signal is also caused by pointing errors in individual aztec observations ( final maps are co - additions of dozens of such observations ) and clustering of the radio sources ; therefore , @xmath37arcsec provides a strong upper limit to the random astrometric errors in the aztec / shades maps .",
    "flux density calibration was performed on a nightly basis as described in section  [ sec : observations ] . all steps in producing the aztec",
    "/ shades maps were performed by the aztec instrument team @xcite and are identical to those employed for other published aztec data sets @xcite , thus minimising systematic differences between these aztec surveys .",
    "flux calibration is expected to be consistent across all regions of the final aztec / shades maps , with each point being sampled numerous times by each of a large set ( @xmath38 ) of observations that span a wide range of atmospheric conditions and calibrations .",
    "we find no significant systematics between individual observations , including between the small mosaic and large full - map observations .",
    "noise properties are consistent across individual observations , with mapping speeds following the correlation with atmospheric opacity described in @xcite .",
    "the methods used to remove atmospheric signal @xcite produce consistent point source kernels ( shape and amplitude ) across all observations , with the resulting attenuation of point sources varying about the mean with an rms of 3.6  per cent ( attenuation corrected for in the final map based on the average reduction in flux density ) .",
    "we also use the stacking analysis of section  [ ssec : astrometry ] as a check of the relative calibrations between fields based on the average mm - wave flux of known radio populations .",
    "we find that the calibrations of the aztec / shades fields are consistent ; the average 1.1mm fluxes at the location of @xmath39@xmath33jy radio sources are @xmath40mjy and @xmath41mjy for the lh and sxdf maps , respectively .",
    "if we remove radio sources that fall within 9  arcseconds of significant aztec ` sources ' with @xmath42 or @xmath43 from the stacking analysis , we find that the stacked average 1.1mm flux becomes @xmath44jy and @xmath45jy for lh and sxdf , respectively .",
    "we also utilise the deeper radio catalogue available for the lh field to determine that the average 1.1mm flux of millimetre - dim @xmath46jy radio sources is @xmath47jy , which is consistent with similar stacks of the aztec / cosmos ( @xmath48jy ; * ? ? ?",
    "aztec / goods - n ( @xmath49jy ; using the radio catalogue of @xcite and the aztec map of @xcite ) surveys . assuming the various fields have similar radio populations , which may not be strictly true for fields with significant structure ( e.g. aztec / cosmos ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these tests show that the calibration across various aztec surveys is consistent within the measurement errors of the stacks . note that since the available radio catalogue does not cover the entire aztec / lh field , we stack only on radio sources found in deep regions of the radio survey ( @xmath50jy ) to ensure a uniform sampling of @xmath51jy sources .",
    "candidate mm - wave sources are identified as local maxima in the optimally filtered maps that pass a chosen threshold .",
    "although it is possible that some local maxima could be due to multiple neighbouring sources ( relative to the fwhm @xmath52arcsec beamsize ) that blend into one peak , the low @xmath53 of most detections prohibits deconvolution of potential multi - source peaks .",
    "aztec maps are mean - subtracted ( i.e. the background has a zero net contribution ) and smgs are expected to be sparse , with less than one source per aztec / jcmt beam down to @xmath54mjy ; therefore , source blending is expected to be rare for bright sources in the aztec / shades survey , unless the smg population is significantly clustered on scales smaller than 18  arcseconds .",
    "since very little is known about the smg population on these scales , we caution the reader that the following analysis assumes no clustering at small scales .",
    "interferometric observations over the coming years with the sma , carma , and later with alma will address the clustering question definitively .",
    "the most robust aztec / shades source candidates are given in tables  [ table : lh_sources][table : sxdf_sources ] .",
    "source candidates are listed in descending order of detected @xmath53 .",
    "centroid source positions are determined using flux - squared weighting of the pixels within 9arcsec ( fwhm/2 ) of the local maxima .",
    "the aztec / shades survey detects 43 and 21 robust sources with @xmath55 in the lh and sxdf fields , respectively .",
    "additional significant detections , as defined in section  [ ssec : source_robustness ] , are also listed in the source tables and considered in the analysis of section  [ sec : counts ] .",
    "multi - wavelength analysis of sources found in the aztec / shades survey , including combined 850@xmath3/1100@xmath3 properties of sources within the overlapping aztec and scuba shades surveys ( negrello et al .",
    ", in prep . )",
    ", is deferred to future publications .",
    "sources discovered in these blind surveys experience two notable flux biases , both of which cause the average measurement of the flux density of a detected source to be high relative to its true intrinsic flux , @xmath56 .",
    "these flux biases can be very significant ( @xmath22  1050  per cent for sources listed in tables  [ table : lh_sources][table : sxdf_sources ] ) , particularly for the low - significance detections that typify smg surveys .",
    "therefore , it is important to characterise and correct for these biases before fluxes and number counts can be compared to measurements at other wavelengths . since these biases are a function of survey depth , these corrections are also necessary before detailed comparisons can be made with other 1.1 mm surveys .",
    "we now present an alternative method of calculating the correlation matrix which better captures these correlations amongst the final differential number count bins .",
    "we begin by integrating the pfd of each source over the span of each flux bin .",
    "these binned probabilities can be summed over all sources to provide a number counts estimate that matches the final averaged results of the full bootstrapping method , but without the robust uncertainty estimates that the bootstrap method is designed to provide .",
    "we apply this alternative number counts estimate to _ each _ of the 100,000 unique catalogues produced by the bootstrap .",
    "the poisson deviation and replacement sampling used to produce each catalogue ( section  [ ssec : nc_algorithm ] ) act to perturb this new estimate of the number counts around the most likely values .",
    "this collection of perturbed number counts is then used to estimate the correlation between the differential number count bins .",
    "we present the resulting correlation matrix for the aztec / shades differential results ( section  [ sec : counts ] ) in table  [ tab : corr ] .",
    "these correlations apply directly to the differential results provided in table  [ tab : counts ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : dnc ] ( 20  per cent threshold counts ) .",
    "the last row of table  [ tab : corr ] provides the standard deviation of the differential counts of each flux bin , as estimated in the bootstrap sampling method .",
    "these values can be applied to the correlation matrix to produce a covariance matrix for the data .",
    "however , the standard deviation is not an ideal representation of the true uncertainty distribution ( table  [ tab : counts ] ) due to the finite sampling of each bin , which results in an asymmetric multinomial probability distribution ( i.e. non - gaussian ) . as discussed in section  [ ssec : nc_fits ]",
    ", care must be taken when attempting to use this covariance matrix in typical fitting algorithms due to the high level of degeneracy amongst the bins .",
    "larger flux bins could be used to reduce the bin - to - bin correlations ; however , significantly larger bins would make flux resolution the limiting factor ( with respect to the precision of the aztec / shades differential number counts estimate ) for most practical applications of the data ."
