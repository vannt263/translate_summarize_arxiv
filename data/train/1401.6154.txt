    "the persistent discrepancy of the measured muon @xmath1 and the standard model ( sm ) prediction at the level of @xmath63@xmath7  @xcite has generated a lot of experimental and theoretical activity in search of a possible explanation . among the new physics explanations for this discrepancy",
    "are weak scale solutions  @xcite _ and _ possible new contributions from light and very weakly coupled new particles ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . for the latter case there must be additional observable effects that involve muons and new forces mediated by light particles .",
    "recently , a new intriguing discrepancy has emerged after the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen has been measured at psi .",
    "the 2010 - 2012 results  @xcite combined with the qed calculations of the same quantity allow for a very accurate extraction of the charge radius of the proton .",
    "the result stands in sharp contradiction with the determination of the proton charge radius in electron - proton scattering experiments and from high - precision spectroscopy of  normal \" hydrogen and deuterium , as summarized in the codata review  @xcite .",
    "the combined discrepancy stands now at more than @xmath8 , with @xmath9 discrepancies with h spectroscopy and scattering separately , and therefore should be taken very seriously . unlike the case of the @xmath1 discrepancy , this latest contradiction _ can not _ be a result of new physics at the weak scale .",
    "broadly speaking , there are several logical pathways toward resolving the present contradiction :    1 .",
    "the muonic atom results are obtained by only one group , and could contain an unaccounted source of error .",
    "however , so far no credible candidates for a systematic shift on the order of @xmath10 mev have been found .",
    "moreover , the measurement of two lines in muonic hydrogen exhibit full self - consistency  @xcite . at the level of accuracy set by the current size of the discrepancy , @xmath11 ,",
    "the qed part of the muonic hydrogen lamb shift calculation is comparatively simple and has been checked by many groups . for a compilation of the related theoretical issues",
    "see ref .",
    "2 .   strong interactions could affect the lamb shift in @xmath12h via a two - photon polarization diagram .",
    "standard calculations based on a dispersive approach ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite for the latest evaluations ) show no room for a contribution that could account for the discrepancy . still , some of the input to these calculations has model dependence built - in  @xcite , and exaggerating this dependence to the extreme  @xcite could hypothetically provide a large frequency shift . in this case",
    ", however , one should expect drastic deviations for the hadronic two - photon effects elsewhere  @xcite which are not observed .",
    "therefore , this is also an unlikely proposition .",
    "3 .   the problem could lie with the determination of @xmath13 in standard hydrogen .",
    "notice that in order to be consistent with the muonic hydrogen lamb shift , results based on _ both _ methods , @xmath0 scattering and hydrogen spectroscopy , would have to be incorrect or have overstated precision .",
    "4 .   finally , it is also possible that some  intermediate range \" force is responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "should such a new force carrier exist in the mev-100 mev mass range , it could potentially affect the @xmath12h lamb shift directly . constructing a model",
    "that would be not immediately ruled out by the existing constraints on dark forces in this range is a difficult challenge  @xcite .",
    "further background information and discussion can be found in the recent review  @xcite .",
    "the search for a resolution to the @xmath13 discrepancy is important because it carries strong implications for the precision of theoretical evaluation of the muon @xmath1 .",
    "suppose , for example , that either  unexpected \" effects of strong interactions ( solution 2 above ) , or some new physics ( solution 4 ) is responsible for inducing , e.g. , a large proton - muon interaction term , c(|__)(|_p _ p ) , [ verynaive ] where coefficient the @xmath14 needs to be @xmath15 in order to explain the discrepancy in @xmath13 measurements .",
    "this effective interaction is shown on the left of fig .",
    "[ f : naive ] .",
    "one can then estimate the typical shift to the muon @xmath1 that this interaction would imply by integrating out the proton , leading to the two - loop effect on the right of fig .",
    "[ f : naive ] .",
    "( other charged hadrons presumably would contribute as well . ) using ( [ verynaive ] ) as a starting point , we perform a simple estimate by rescaling the well - known perturbative formula for the two - loop higgs / heavy quark contributions to the muon @xmath1 found in , e.g. ,  @xcite . since we are converting a dimension-6 operator in ( [ verynaive ] ) into the dimension-5 @xmath1 operator , the result is linearly divergent and presumably is stabilized by some hadronic scale @xmath16 , where neither the coefficient @xmath14 nor the proton - photon vertex can be considered local . taking a wide range for @xmath16 , from a proton mass scale @xmath17 to a very light dynamical scale @xmath18 , one arrives at the following estimates of a typical expected shift for the muon anomalous magnetic moment , @xmath19 which , after inputing the value of @xmath14 implied by the @xmath13 discrepancy results in 510 ^ -9 |(a _ ) | 10 ^ -7 .",
    "clearly , the upper range of this possible shift is enormous while the lower range is still large , on the order of the existing discrepancy in muon @xmath1 .",
    "it is three times the size of the current estimates for the hadronic light - by - light contributions , and one order of magnitude larger than the uncertainty claimed for that contribution .",
    "these estimates show that if indeed large muon - proton interactions are responsible for the @xmath13 discrepancy , one can no longer insist that theoretical calculations of the muon @xmath1 are under control .",
    "thus , a resolution of the @xmath13 problem is urgently needed in light of the new significant investments made in the continuation of the experimental @xmath1 program .    in this paper",
    ", we entertain the possibility ( solution 4 ) that a new vector force is responsible for the discrepancy .",
    "our goal is to investigate the status of this vector force in light of the @xmath1 results for the electron and muon and to derive additional constraints from the hyperfine structure of muonium .",
    "as we will show , the presence of a parity - violating coupling to the muon is a very likely consequence of such models , and in light of that we calculate the two - loop constraint on the parity violating muon - nucleon forces imposed by ultra - precise tests of parity in the electron sector .",
    "we believe that our analysis is timely , given the new experimental information that will soon emerge from the measurement of the lamb shift in muonic deuterium and helium and the new efforts at making the ordinary hydrogen measurements more precise .",
    "our approach to the new force is purely phenomenological . at the same time it is important to realize that the embedding of such new force into the structure of the sm is very difficult and so far no fully consistent models of such new interaction",
    "have been proposed .",
    "( the closest attempt , the gauged @xmath20 model of ref .",
    "@xcite , suffers from a gauge anomaly and thus must be regarded as an effective model up to some ultraviolet scale , close to the weak scale . )",
    "therefore , even a phenomenologically successful model that would explain the @xmath13 discrepancy and pass through all additional constraints should be viewed at this point as an exercise which can be taken more seriously only if a credible sm embedding is found , or if the new force hypothesis finds further experimental support .",
    "we illustrate the need for the consistent sm embedding explicitly , by considering the high - energy constraints on the muon - specific vector force .",
    "we show that normally not - so - precise observables such as @xmath5-boson decay branching fractions become extremely constraining , since they are affected by the muon - specific force because of the breaking of the full sm gauge invariance .",
    "we observe that @xmath21 enhancement of all charged current effects is a generic price for the absence of a consistent sm embedding , which strongly disfavors such models .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce a model for an intermediate - range force , and determine the parameter values suggested by the @xmath13 anomaly . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hfs_np ] we calculate the one loop contribution to the muonium hyperfine structure . section  [ sec:2loop ] contains the calculation of the two - loop transfer of the parity violation in the muon sector to electrons .",
    "section  [ sec : high - energy ] has a the discussion of the high - energy constraints .",
    "section  [ sec : combination ] combines all the constraints on the model and we reach our conclusions in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we will choose an entirely phenomenological approach and allow for one new particle to mediate the new force between muons and protons .",
    "motivated by dark photon models  @xcite , we assume that the new particle mostly interacts with the electromagnetic current and , in addition , has further vector and axial - vector coupling to muons . the interaction lagrangian for this choice is given by @xmath22\\\\ \\label{start } = - v_\\nu\\left [   e\\kappa \\bar \\psi_p \\gamma_\\nu \\psi_p - e\\kappa \\bar \\psi_e \\gamma_\\nu \\psi_e \\right .",

    "we use positive @xmath24 .",
    "the constant @xmath25 is the mixing angle between the photon and @xmath23 .",
    "it is a safe assumption that this mixing must be small .",
    "@xmath26 and @xmath27 are the new phenomenological muon - specific couplings that are introduced in this paper by hand .",
    "the interaction via a conserved current , @xmath28 allows for a uv completion via kinetic mixing , and is totally innocuous .",
    "the muon - specific couplings @xmath26 and @xmath27 are much more problematic from the point of view of uv completion and full sm gauge invariance .",
    "notice that in parallel to the kinetic mixing type coupling @xmath29 , there exists another  safe \" coupling via the baryonic current , @xmath30 .",
    "the reason we suppress it in this paper is because of the extra phenomenological problems it creates , chiefly the additional o(10 - 100 fm ) range force for neutrons  a possibility that is very constrained by neutron scattering experiments .",
    "it may look strange that the new force introduced in ( [ start ] ) includes parity violation for muons .",
    "in fact , as we will see shortly , the @xmath27 coupling is necessary to cancel the excessive one - loop contribution to the muon @xmath1 generated by the @xmath26 coupling .",
    "having formulated our starting point with the lagrangian in eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) , it is easy to present a combination of couplings that alleviates the current @xmath13 discrepancy .",
    "choosing the same sign for @xmath25 and @xmath31 will create an additional attractive force between protons and muons .",
    "it will be interpreted as the difference between charge radii observed in regular and muonic hydrogen : @xmath32 here we explicitly assume that the momentum transfer in the @xmath12h system , @xmath33 , is smaller than the mass of the mediator , @xmath4 . in the second line we have normalized the coupling in such a way as to factor out the size of the suggested correction for @xmath13 , which corresponds to a relative shift of the squared radius of @xmath34 . at the same time",
    ", we have normalized @xmath4 and @xmath25 on their values that correspond to the borderline of the constraint that comes from combining the electron @xmath1 measurement with qed theory and the independent atomic physics determination of @xmath35 .",
    "equation  ( [ rp ] ) makes clear the fact that given the strong constraints on @xmath25 and @xmath4 , only relatively large values for the muon - specific coupling @xmath26 are capable of correcting the @xmath13 anomaly . at the same time",
    ", it is clear that the muon @xmath1 value will be in conflict with @xmath36 _ unless _ there is a significant degree of cancellation between @xmath37- and @xmath38-proportional contributions .",
    "fortunately , such contributions are of the opposite sign and the possibility of cancellation does exist .",
    "moreover , since in the limit of @xmath39 the contribution of the axial - vector coupling to anomalous magnetic moment @xmath40 is parametrically enhanced compared to the vector coupling , @xmath41 such a cancellation can be achieved with a relatively small value of @xmath42 .",
    "such small values of @xmath27 still induce a parity violating amplitude for muons well above the level suggested by the weak interactions .",
    "however , the direct tests of neutral current parity violation for muons at low energy have not been carried out directly  @xcite , and the existence of enhanced parity - violating effects involving muons should be regarded as an opportunity to test these models in the future  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the similar tuning of vector against axial - vector contribution is _ not _",
    "possible for the electron @xmath1 , mainly because of the lack of corresponding enhancement for the axial - vector contribution and excessively strong constraints on new axial couplings for electrons .    finally , we comment on the possibility that a scalar particle mediates a long - range force",
    ". on one hand , the constraints from @xmath1 of the electron are milder because it is reasonable to expect that the coupling would scale proportional to mass , @xmath43 .",
    "on the other hand , the coupling to neutrons that would also be a generic consequence of such model would limit @xmath44 to below the @xmath45 level , requiring the coupling to muons be @xmath46 and larger . as in the vector case ,",
    "the correction to @xmath1 of the muon is too large . unlike the vector case",
    ", one can not use the opposite parity coupling to cancel this contribution .",
    "this is because the cancellation can be achieved only when the pseudoscalar coupling is approximately the same as the scalar one , @xmath47 .",
    "this maximally @xmath48-violating case leads to unacceptably large edms of neutrons and heavy atoms , even after making generous allowance for the suppression coming from the two - loop mediation mechanism .",
    "therefore , one needs _ extra _",
    "light states beyond a single scalar .",
    "we therefore abandon this possibility , and concentrate on the vector force ( [ start ] ) , where only one new particle is introduced .",
    "the best experimental result on the muonium 1s hyperfine structure ( hfs ) interval is  @xcite @xmath49    to compare it with theory one has to find the leading term , the so - called fermi energy , @xmath50 and qed corrections to it  @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy can be presented in terms of fundamental constants in many different ways , but unavoidably , when describing the hfs interaction of a muon ( and electron ) one has to input either the muon magnetic moment or the muon mass in appropriate units .    presently , it is the determination of the muon mass ( or muon magnetic moment ) @xcite that dominates the uncertainty of the theoretical prediction  @xcite , @xmath51 leading to the following comparison of theory and experiment : @xmath52 the concordance determines a room for possible exotic corrections , which we limit at @xmath53 , @xmath54    one has to remember that calculation of the fermi energy involves fundamental constants and any effect of new physics would affect their determination as well ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . here , we are most interested in the mediator mass range that is higher than the typical momenta of atomic constituents , and much higher than that of macroscopic physics . therefore , the atomic determination of @xmath35 and @xmath55 are unaffected by new physics .",
    "indeed , the value for @xmath55 comes from measurements of the hyperfine structure of muonium in a magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field dependence and the determination of the field through free proton precession produce a value for @xmath55 , which corresponds to very low momentum transfers and is not sensitive to short - range effects .",
    "therefore , we can safely proceed by calculating the contributions from the box diagram in fig .",
    "[ f : hfs ] .",
    "the necessity of introducing an axial - vector coupling results in stronger - than - weak amplitudes for parity non - conservation ( pnc ) effects involving muons . however , since there are no direct constraints on neutral current pnc with muons at low energy , we are led to consider two - loop mediation mechanism shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pnc ] that transfers parity violation from the muon to the electron sector .",
    "typically , two - loop corrections to pnc amplitudes are not expected to be large . however , because in our model we start with an effective four - fermion @xmath65 interaction with a coupling ( of mass dimension @xmath66 ) that is much larger than @xmath67 while the precision in measuring the weak charge is better than 1% , one can expect a reasonably strong constraint despite the two - loop suppression .    currently , the most precise experimental determination of the pnc amplitude for @xmath68cs  @xcite is supplemented by high - accuracy atomic calculations  @xcite that give a very good agreement of experiment with the sm . for this paper",
    ", we shall adopt the bound on new physics contribution to the weak charge of cesium nucleus at @xmath53 level following the latest theoretical determination  @xcite , @xmath69 vertex generated by the muon loop does not decouple in the limit of @xmath70 , because of the properties of the fermionic triangle diagram  @xcite .",
    "moreover , because of what can be viewed as a gauge anomaly , there is a sensitivity to the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath71 . performing the direct calculation of the two - loop induced @xmath23-electron axial - vector coupling in the limit of small momentum transfer and retaining only the logarithmically enhanced contributions , we arrive at the following result : @xmath72 without a uv - complete theory it is then impossible to make a definitive prediction .",
    "we note , however , that the simplest way to cutoff the logarithm is to extend the model to @xmath73 leptons , and take @xmath74 . in that case",
    "the answer for the new physics contribution to the electron - proton parity violating interaction and the corresponding effective shift of the weak charge of @xmath68cs take the following form , @xmath75    substituting typical values for the parameters of the model , we arrive at the following shift of the weak charge : @xmath76 while the contribution to @xmath77 can be either positive or negative , we do not keep track of the sign of @xmath27 since the required value for @xmath27 to satisfy @xmath78 can be of either sign , c.f .",
    "( [ cancel ] ) .",
    "although atomic parity violation as well as pnc experiments with electron scattering can potentially constrain the size of @xmath27 , there is also a question of how to search for enhanced pnc involving muons directly .",
    "references  @xcite have pointed out that polarized muon scattering and muonic atoms can be used for these purposes . here",
    "we would like to remark that an alternative way of searching for neutral current pnc with muons is polarized electron scattering with muon pair production , @xmath79 .",

    "so far we have dealt with the low - energy observables that are only mildly sensitive to the fact that the effective lagrangian ( [ start ] ) at a generic point in @xmath81 parameter space does not respect the full gauge invariance of the sm . specifically , we have insisted that the muon neutrinos are uncharged under the new force , due to the fact that their interactions are well - known and do not have any room for @xmath82 new physics effects , let alone stronger - than-@xmath67 effects as suggested by the @xmath13 discrepancy .",
    "we also do not assume any direct coupling of @xmath23 to @xmath5-bosons other than via the kinetic mixing @xmath25 .",
    "it is then clear that the sm _ charged _ current processes accompanied by the emission of the light vector boson @xmath23 from the muon line will be drastically different from a similar process with an emission of a photon .",
    "in particular , the interaction of the longitudinal part of the @xmath23 boson will be enhanced with energy due to the absence of the conservation of the corresponding current . as pointed out in refs .",
    "@xcite , direct production of @xmath23 from muons in @xmath83 decays can be enhanced by a factor of @xmath84 for the @xmath85 current , and even more for the @xmath86 current . in the latter case",
    "it is advantageous to study very high - energy processes ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , where the enhancement can scale as ( energy)@xmath87 .",
    "one of the best known charged current processes is the leptonic decay of @xmath5 boson .",
    "when @xmath88 ( in other words , when the coupling of @xmath23 boson to the left - handed muon is not zero ) the decay @xmath89 will be enhanced by @xmath90 , with the onset of an effectively strong coupling when @xmath91 .",
    "since this parameter is indeed larger than one for the interesting part of parameter space , one should expect a very strong constraint on the model .",
    "carrying out explicit calculation in the limit of @xmath92 , as implied by @xmath78 , and to leading order in @xmath93 and @xmath94 , we arrive at @xmath95 because of the prompt decay of @xmath23 to an electron - positron pair , and the small value of @xmath4 , this decay will be similar to @xmath96 . in any case",
    ", the additional channel leads to the increase of the total @xmath5 width .",
    "the contribution in eq .",
    "( [ wdec ] ) should be compared against the current experimental value for the @xmath5 width , dominated by measurements at the tevatron  @xcite , @xmath97 given the agreement of this with sm expectations for @xmath98 and @xmath99hadrons , we limit the contribution of the @xmath100 mode to the @xmath5 width to twice its error , leading to a branching @xmath101 at @xmath53 .",
    "this translates to a limit on the coupling of @xmath23 to muons of @xmath102    it is clear that a large correction to @xmath5 decay is an example of strong high - energy constraints resulting from the lack of the consistent sm embedding of the starting point in eq .",
    "( [ start ] ) .",
    "there are other processes that can be equally problematic for such models .",
    "for example , insertion of the virtual @xmath23 line into the @xmath103 loop in the @xmath5 self - energy diagram will result in the shift of @xmath104 and will impact the very precisely measured @xmath105-parameter of the electroweak theory . since the lack of the full sm gauge invariance , one should expect a power - like sensitivity to the uv cutoff in such theory , which is even stronger enhancement than @xmath90 .",
    "thus , indeed , these examples show an utmost need for a consistent sm embedding at the level of the very starting point ( [ start ] ) .",

    "together with the isotopic shift constraints and accurate theoretical calculations of deuterium polarization , this measurement will be able to shed some additional light on the internal self - consistency of the results . in the speculative world of new physics models",
    ", it will provide extra invaluable information on whether an additional coupling of new forces to neutrons is warranted .",
    "in particular , it will clarify whether one should revisit constraints on new scalar - mediated forces .",
    "* it is worth emphasizing that the new muon - proton scattering experiment at psi , muse  @xcite , may not detect the presence of the new muon - specific force if the mediator mass is small .",
    "indeed , the experiment will use a momentum transfer of @xmath136 mev , which is larger than the preferred mediator mass range .",
    "consequently , the measured charge radius of the proton in the muon - proton scattering may not differ from @xmath0 result _ despite _ the possible presence of a new force .",
    "* direct production of new particles with their subsequent decay to electron - positron pairs may be efficiently searched with the muons in the initial state .",
    "for example , a careful study of @xmath137 may reveal unexpected peaks at low invariant mass of the pair . a new experiment searching for @xmath138 decay",
    "@xcite will also have capabilities of probing @xmath139 decays .",
    "we believe that future progress in gaining understanding of the @xmath13 problem will come from experiment . besides the previously mentioned results with the muonic deuterium and the ongoing experiment with muonic helium , one should pay close attention to improvements in experiments with spectroscopy of ordinary hydrogen .",
    "if subsequent muonic experiments show no particular anomalies , while the new results with ordinary hydrogen reinforce the @xmath13 problem , it may be worth checking the idea of the electron - specific force , that creates a small amount of _ repulsion _ between electron and a proton , and have a mass of the mediator in the range between @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "in this case , one can avoid the constraints from @xmath1 of the electron , as the required scale of couplings will be tiny .",
    "but at the same time , the question of consistent embedding of such new force into the sm will still remain , and such models will face the very same difficulties as  muonic forces \" discussed in this work .",
    "in addition , sub - mev mediator masses are also subject to very strong constraints from cosmology and astrophysics .",

    "<S> the recent measurement of the lamb shift in muonic hydrogen allows for the most precise extraction of the charge radius of the proton which is currently in conflict with other determinations based on @xmath0 scattering and hydrogen spectroscopy . this discrepancy could be the result of some new muon - specific force with o(1 - 100 ) </S>",

    "<S> such an explanation faces challenges from the constraints imposed by the @xmath1 of the muon and electron as well as precision spectroscopy of muonic atoms . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we complement the family of constraints by calculating the contribution of hypothetical forces to the muonium hyperfine structure . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the two - loop contribution to the electron parity violating amplitude due to a muon loop , which is sensitive to the muon axial - vector coupling . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we find that the combination of low - energy constraints favors the mass of the mediator to be below 10 mev , and that a certain degree of tuning is required between vector and axial - vector couplings of new vector particles to muons in order to satisfy constraints from muon @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> . however , we also observe that in the absence of a consistent standard model embedding , high energy weak - charged processes accompanied by the emission of new vector particles are strongly enhanced by @xmath2 , with @xmath3 a characteristic energy scale and @xmath4 the mass of the mediator . </S>",
