    "since the discovery of the first two quantum algorithms , shor s factoring algorithm @xcite and grover s database search algorithm @xcite , research in the new born field of quantum computation exploded @xcite .",
    "mainly motivated by the idea that a computational device based on quantum mechanics might be ( possibly exponentially ) more powerful than a classical one @xcite , great effort has been done to investigate new quantum algorithms and , more importantly , to experimentally construct a universal quantum computer . however , finding quantum algorithms is a difficult task .",
    "it has also been proved extremely difficult to experimentally construct a quantum computer , as well as to carry out quantum computations .",
    "recently , several groups have investigated quantum analogues of random walk algorithms @xcite , as a possible direction of research to adapt known classical algorithms to the quantum case .",
    "random walks on graphs play an essential role in various fields of natural science , ranging from astronomy , solid - state physics , polymer chemistry , and biology to mathematics and computer science @xcite .",
    "current investigations show that quantum random walks have remarkably different features to the classical counterparts @xcite .",
    "the hope is that a quantum version of the random walk might lead to applications unavailable classically , and to construct new quantum algorithms .",
    "indeed , the first quantum algorithms based on quantum walks with remarkable speedup have been reported @xcite .",
    "further , experimental schemes have also been proposed to implement such quantum random walks by using an ion trap quantum computer @xcite and by using neutral atoms trapped in optical lattices @xcite . up to now",
    ", only three methods have been used to demonstrate quantum logical gates : trapped ions @xcite , cavity qed @xcite and nmr @xcite .",
    "of these methods , nmr has been the most successful with realizations of quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum error correction @xcite , quantum simulation @xcite , quantum algorithms @xcite , quantum games @xcite and others @xcite . in this paper , we present the experimental implementation of the quantum random walk algorithm on a two - qubit nmr quantum computer , and we believe it is the first experimental implementation of such quantum algorithms .",
    "we consider continuous - time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite rather than discrete - time random walks @xcite , on a circle with four nodes . we show that the evolution of this quantum walk is periodic and reversible , and yields an exactly uniform probability distribution at certain time . while the classical ctrw is irreversible and only approximates the uniform distribution at infinite - time limit .",
    "further , we experimentally implement this quantum walk on a two - qubit quantum computer , using a unitary operator which has the right `` effective '' hamiltonian , with good agreements between theory and experiment .",
    "it is interestingly found that the property of the quantum walk strongly depends on the entanglement between the two qubits .",
    "the uniform distribution could be obtained only when the two qubits are maximally entangled .",
    "the concept of quantum ctrw is proposed in ref . @xcite . on a circle with four nodes ,",
    "we denote the set of nodes by @xmath0 .",
    "since the structure of the circle is periodic , only two nodes , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , are connected to node @xmath3 @xmath4 . in the classical ctrw , let @xmath5 denote the jumping rate , which is a fixed , time - independent constant that represents the probability moving from a given node to a connected one per unit time .",
    "the generator matrix @xcite of this walk can therefore be written as@xmath6{cccc}% 2\\gamma & -\\gamma & 0 & -\\gamma\\\\ -\\gamma & 2\\gamma & -\\gamma & 0\\\\ 0 & -\\gamma & 2\\gamma & -\\gamma\\\\ -\\gamma & 0 & -\\gamma & 2\\gamma \\end{array } \\right )   .",

    "a natural way to the quantum version of this ctrw is to construct a hilbert space spanned by the four basis @xmath12 , respectively corresponding to the four nodes @xmath0 .",
    "the state of a particle walking quantum mechanically on this circle is then denoted by @xmath13 , which is generally a superposition of the four basis , rather than classical mixing of the probabilities of being at the four nodes . the generator matrix in classical walks is now treated as the hamiltonian of the quantum evolution @xcite .",
    "therefore the schrdinger equation of the state @xmath14 is@xmath15 if measuring at time @xmath8 , we can obtain a certain probability distribution on the circle .",

    "the particle walking quantum mechanically on this circle will definitely go back to its original position , and the evolution is reversible .",
    "it is also interesting to see that at time @xmath24 the probability distribution converges to node @xmath25 .",
    "these phenomena are due to the quantum interference effects , which allows probability amplitudes from different paths to cancel each other .",
    "to measure how uniform a distribution is , an immediate way is to use the _ total variation distance _ between the given distribution and the uniform distribution . in our case , the classical and quantum total variation distance as functions of time @xmath8 are@xmath26 fig .",
    "[ distributeplots ] depicts the dependence of @xmath27 and @xmath28 on time @xmath8 . from fig .",
    "[ distributeplots ] , we can see that the classical version of this walking process approaches the uniform distribution exponentially as time lapses .",
    "in contrast , the quantum process exhibits an oscillating behavior .",
    "an intriguing property of this quantum random walk is that @xmath29 if @xmath30 is odd , which means that the probability distribution is exactly uniform at time @xmath31 and its odd multiples .",
    "while the classical walk can never reach the exactly uniform distribution , only approximates it at infinite - time limit .",
    "[ ptb ]    fig3.eps",
    "for the quantum ctrw on a circle with four node , the hilbert space is 4-demensional .",
    "so it is natural to implement the quantum walks on a two - qubit quantum computer .",

    "is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ entanglementplot ] . from fig .",
    "[ entanglementplot ] , we can see that if there is no entanglement between the two qubits ( @xmath48 ) , @xmath49 is at its maximal @xmath50 , which corresponds converging at node @xmath19 ( or node @xmath25 ) .",
    "while if the two qubits are maximally entangled ( @xmath51 ) , @xmath52 , which happens to be the situation that the walking particle is uniformly distributed on the four nodes",
    ". therefore , we can say that the quantum random walk algorithm is enhanced by the quantum entanglement involved .",
    "the quantum ctrw is implemented using our two - qubit nmr quantum computer .",
    "this computer uses a @xmath53 milliliter , @xmath54 millimolar sample of carbon-13 labeled chloroform ( cambridge isotopes ) in d@xmath55 acetone . in a magnetic field ,",
    "the two spin states of @xmath56h  and @xmath57c  nuclei in the molecular can be described as four nodes of two qubits , while radio frequency ( rf ) fields and spin ",
    "spin couple constant @xmath58 are used to implement quantum network of ctrw .",
    "experimentally , we performe twelve separate sets of experiments with various selection of time @xmath8 which is distinguished by @xmath59 . in the following ,",
    "we replace the jumping rate @xmath5 with @xmath60 @xmath61__. _ _ in each set , the full process of the quantum ctrw is executed .",
    "we describe this experimental process as follows .",
    "firstly , prepare effective pure state @xmath62 : the initial state in nmr is thermally equilibrium state @xmath63 rather than a true pure state @xmath64 .",
    "however , it is possible to create an effective pure state , which behaves in an equivalent manner .",
    "this is implemented as @xmath65 to be read from left to right , radio - frequency pulses are indicated by @xmath66 , and are applied to the spins in the superscript , along the axis in the subscript , by the angle in the brackets . for example , @xmath67 denotes @xmath68 selective pulse that acts on the first qubit about @xmath69 , and so forth .",
    "@xmath70 is the pulsed field gradient along the @xmath71 axis to annihilate transverse magnetizations , dashes are for readability only , and @xmath72 represents a time interval of @xmath73 .",
    "therefore , after the state preparation , we obatin effective pure state @xmath74 from equilibrium state @xmath75 .    secondly , perform quantum ctrw with different time @xmath8 : as shown above in equation ( [ eq 8 ] ) , quantum ctrw can be described as unitary operator @xmath76 , this is performed with pulse sequence shown in the following ( note that the global phase @xmath77 of @xmath78 is safely ignored in our experiments , since @xmath79 , this global phase is meaningless and has no effect on the result of experiment)@xmath80 here @xmath81 is equal to @xmath82 that act on the second spin , where @xmath83 and @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath86 denotes @xmath87 non - selective pulse that acts on both qubits about @xmath69 .",
    "it is obviously that the final state @xmath88 of the quantum ctrw prior to measure is given by @xmath89 .",
    "finally , readout the result @xmath88 and calculate quantum total variation distance @xmath28 : in nmr experiment , it is not practical to determine the final state directly , but an equivalent measurement can be made by so - called quantum state tomography to recover the density matrix @xmath90 .",
    "however , as only the diagonal elements of the final density operators are needed in our experiments , the readout procedure is simplified by applying gradient pulse before readout pulse to cancel the off - diagonal elements . here",
    "we shall note that , the gradient pulse can remove off - diagonal terms since we use heteronuclear systems in our experiment .",
    "then quantum total variation distance @xmath28 is determined by the equation @xmath91 , where @xmath92  is certain probability on the node @xmath93 .",
    "finally , @xmath94 is determined with equation ( [ eq 12 ] ) .",
    "all experiments are conducted at room temperature and pressure on bruker avance dmx-500 spectrometer in laboratory of structure biology , university of science and technology of china .",

    "[ distributeplots ] and fig .",
    "[ entanglementplot ] , it is clearly seen the good agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "however , there exist small errors which increase when time @xmath8 increase , we think that the most errors are primarily due to decoherence , because the time used to implement quantum ctrw @xmath76 is increased from several to several tens milliseconds approximately , while the decoherence time @xmath96 and @xmath97 seconds for carbon and proton respectively .",
    "the other errors are due to inhomogeneity of magnetic field , imperfect pulses , and the variability over time of the measurement process .",
    "we present the experimental implementation of the quantum random walk algorithm on a two - qubit nuclear magnetic resonance quantum computer . for the quantum ctrw on a circle with four nodes ,",
    "we observe that the quantum walk behaves greatly differently from its classical version",
    ". the quantum ctrw can yield an exactly uniform distribution , and is reversible and periodic , while the classical walk is essentially dissipative .",
    "further , we find that the property of this quantum walk strongly depends on the quantum entanglement between the two qubits . the uniform distribution could be obtained only when the two qubits are maximally entangled . in this paper only the relatively simple case with two qubits are considered . however",
    ", our scheme could be extended to the case of a graph containing arbitrary @xmath98 nodes , and the quantum random walk could be carried out by using @xmath99 qubits .",
