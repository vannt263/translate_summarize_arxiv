    "neutron star crusts are important laboratories for the study of asymmetric nuclear matter at subnuclear density  @xcite .",
    "the crust is divided into an outer crust and an inner crust at the neutron drip density @xmath0 where neutrons begin to drip out of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the outer crust consists of a lattice of nuclei with a gas of electrons , while the inner crust contains neutron - rich nuclei , dripped neutrons , and relativistic electrons  @xcite .",
    "great efforts have been devoted to the study of neutron star crusts because of their importance in astrophysical observations and complex phase structure  @xcite . at low densities around @xmath1 ,",
    "the stable shape of the nucleus is spherical , but it may change from droplet to rod , slab , tube , and bubble , known as nuclear pasta phases , at relatively high densities  @xcite . the neutron drip density is determined by the neutron chemical potential , which is strongly dependent on the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to investigate the effects of the symmetry energy on the neutron drip density and properties of neutron star crusts around the neutron drip point .    the nuclear symmetry energy and its density dependence play a crucial role in understanding various phenomena in nuclear physics and astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy @xmath2 at saturation density can be constrained by experiments to be around @xmath3 mev , while the symmetry energy slope @xmath4 at saturation density is still very uncertain and may vary from about @xmath5 to @xmath6 mev  @xcite .",
    "many properties of neutron stars , such as the crust structure , the crust - core transition , and the star radius , are sensitive to the symmetry energy and its density dependence  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the properties of nuclei in the inner crust were studied using a parametrized thomas ",
    "fermi approach ; they were found to be sensitive to the density dependence of the symmetry energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a self - consistent thomas ",
    "fermi approximation was used to calculate the properties of the inner crust including pasta phases , and it was found that @xmath4 could have dramatic effects on the crust structure .    the equilibrium state of neutron star crusts can be determined by minimizing the total energy density at a given average baryon density @xmath7 under the conditions of @xmath8 equilibrium and charge neutrality . the outer crust is well described based on experimental masses of neutron - rich nuclei , but the inner crust has to be studied by using phenomenological models due to the presence of dripped neutrons . in past decades , the structure of the inner crust has been investigated by using various methods , such as the liquid - drop model  @xcite and the thomas  fermi approach  @xcite . using the wigner ",
    "seitz approximation , the crust is divided into spherical cells , in which a nucleus is located in the center surrounded by a gas of electrons and neutrons . a simple treatment for the matter inside the wigner  seitz cell is referred to as the coexisting phases ( cp ) method  @xcite , in which the matter inside the cell separates into a dense phase and a dilute phase with a sharp interface .",
    "the two coexisting phases satisfy gibbs conditions for phase equilibrium , which correspond to bulk equilibrium without finite - size effects .",
    "the surface and coulomb energies are perturbatively taken into account after the coexisting phases are achieved .",
    "another treatment of the inner crust is based on a compressible liquid - drop ( cld ) model and in this treatment the equilibrium state is determined by minimization of the total energy density including the surface and coulomb energies  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the finite - size effects due to the surface and coulomb energies are properly taken into account in this method .",

    "it is important to compare and analyze the differences between these methods and explore their validity at low density .",
    "this paper has two aims .",
    "the first one is to analyze the differences between the methods used for the study of neutron star crusts , so as to examine the finite - size effects due to the surface and coulomb energies in determining the equilibrium state at low density .",
    "in fact , we find that the energy density obtained in the cp method is generally larger than that of the corresponding homogeneous phase at low densities around the neutron drip point",
    ". the failure of the cp method at low densities may be due to the improper treatment of the surface and coulomb energies .",
    "the second aim of this paper is to investigate the effects of the symmetry energy on the neutron drip density and properties of neutron star crusts . to calculate the properties of neutron star crusts , we employ the tf approximation , which is considered to be self - consistent in the treatment of finite - size effects and nucleon distributions .",
    "for the nuclear interaction , we adopt the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) theory , which has been successfully used to study various phenomena in nuclear physics  @xcite . in the rmf approach",
    ", nucleons interact via the exchange of scalar and vector mesons , while the parameters are fitted to nuclear matter saturation properties or ground - state properties of finite nuclei .",
