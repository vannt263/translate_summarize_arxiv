    "for heavy quarks , the non - relativistic bound - state picture suggests the notion of the pole mass @xmath1 defined , order by order in perturbation theory , as the position of the singularity in the renormalized quark propagator .",
    "the pole mass is gauge invariant , infrared finite , and renormalization - scheme independent @xcite . in the context of perturbation theory ,",
    "it is thus a meaningful `` physical '' parameter .",
    "once non - perturbative effects are taken into account , however , this concept needs to be generalized , since in reality there is no pole in the quark propagator because of confinement .",
    "recently , it has been shown that signals for such non - perturbative effects can be found in the asymptotic behaviour of perturbation theory itself .",
    "the presence of infrared renormalons in the perturbative series that relates the pole mass to a mass defined at short distances leads to an unavoidable ambiguity of order @xmath2 in the definition of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the appearance of renormalons signals that perturbation theory is incomplete without the inclusion of non - perturbative corrections .",
    "in fact , much of the non - perturbative structure of a theory can be inferred from a study of the singularities of correlation functions after borel transformation with respect to the coupling constant .",
    "the application of this approach to qcd was pioneered by t hooft @xcite .",
    "the positions of the singularities on the positive real axis signal the magnitude of non - perturbative corrections . in turn",
    ", the structure of non - perturbative corrections implies constraints for the structure of infrared renormalons @xcite@xcite .",
    "the existence of a `` physical '' definition of the mass of a heavy quark , which agrees with the pole mass up to terms of order @xmath2 , plays a crucial role in the construction of the heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) @xcite@xcite , which by now has become the main theoretical tool used to analyze the properties and decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark . in view of the intrinsic ambiguity in the definition of the pole mass",
    ", the question arises whether the hqet is an inconsistent effective theory , whose predictions are plagued by renormalon ambiguities . the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that this is not the case .",
    "renormalons enter hqet predictions because one tries to separate perturbative and non - perturbative ( as opposed to short- and long - distance ) effects into coefficient functions and matrix elements .",
    "infrared renormalons appear in the coefficient functions since soft loop momenta give a non - negligible contribution to the feynman integrals which appear in their calculation .",
    "similarly , ultraviolet renormalons appear in the matrix elements because of the power divergence of feynman integrals in the hqet . in this paper",
    ", we argue that in predictions for physical quantities such as weak decay amplitudes , renormalon ambiguities cancel between coefficient functions and matrix elements .",
    "a generic hqet prediction for a physical quantity @xmath3 is of the form @xmath4 we will trace the cancellation of renormalons explicitly to subleading order in @xmath0 , by showing that the infrared renormalon in @xmath5 cancels against an ultraviolet renormalon in the matrix element @xmath6 , so that the sum of the two terms on the right - hand side is unambiguous . in more complicated processes such as flavour - changing transitions between two heavy hadrons of different velocity , the way in which these cancellations take place",
    "is rather non - trivial .",
    "however , that they take place should not be a surprise .",
    "in fact , the appearance of renormalons could be avoided if in the construction of the hqet one would follow the idea of wilson s operator product expansion ( ope ) @xcite literally @xcite .",
    "the ope is not designed to separate perturbative and non - perturbative effects , but to disentangle the physics on different distance scales .",
    "this is not accomplished when one uses dimensional regularization in the calculation of the coefficient functions .",
    "instead , one should introduce a hard factorization scale @xmath7 by cutting out momenta @xmath8 from the feynman diagrams which determine the wilson coefficients , and attribute these contributions to the matrix elements . in practice , this procedure is impracticable and awkward , but it would eliminate the infrared renormalons from the coefficient functions and the ultraviolet renormalons from the matrix elements .",
    "what is important is that in the hqet such a program could be implemented without changing the transformation property of the effective lagrangian under the spin - flavour symmetry @xcite .",
    "hence , the structure of the predictions obtained using the hqet remains unaffected .",
    "this implies that renormalons enter the usual ( practical ) form of the hqet in such a way that they do not spoil the relations imposed by heavy quark symmetry @xcite and the equation of motion ( including the vanishing of certain @xmath0 corrections at zero recoil @xcite ) , and they do not increase the number of hadronic form factors that appear in a given order of the @xmath0 expansion .",
    "let us note in passing that in the lattice formulation of the hqet ( or indeed in any regularization scheme with a dimensionful cut - off ) one encounters ultraviolet divergences which behave as powers of the ultraviolet cutoff ( i.e.  inverse powers of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "these power divergences are due to the mixing of higher dimensional operators with lower dimensional ones .",
    "they become more severe as higher - order terms in the @xmath0 expansion are calculated . the presence of power divergences , and the fact that they are likely to imply the existence of non - perturbative effects , and hence to require non - perturbative subtractions , was explained in ref .  @xcite .",
    "the close connection between the presence of power divergences and that of ultraviolet renormalons in matrix elements of higher dimensional operators in the hqet was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , and will become apparent below .",
    "techniques for the non - perturbative subtraction of the power divergences in lattice simulations are being developed @xcite ; a brief outline of the approach can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we briefly discuss the appearance of renormalons in the asymptotics of perturbation theory and their relation to singularities in the borel transform of correlation functions . to obtain a renormalon calculus which is convenient for explicit calculations , we follow refs .",
    "@xcite and consider qcd in the limit of a large number of light quark flavours .",
    "we then recall some of the reasoning behind the usual construction of the hqet and show in which way it is affected by infrared renormalons in the pole mass of the heavy quark . in sects .",
    "[ sec:3 ] and [ sec:4 ] , we study the cancellation of renormalons in exclusive heavy - to - heavy and heavy - to - light decay processes . in the first type of decays , the symmetries of the effective theory",
    "imply a set of non - trivial consistency conditions , which relate the infrared renormalons in the coefficient functions of bilinear heavy quark currents to the infrared renormalon in the pole mass .",
    "we derive the exact form of these relations , which are independent of any unknown hadronic matrix element .",
    "we then check them to order @xmath9 .",
    "we also show with an explicit calculation that a sum rule recently derived by shifman et al .",
    "@xcite , which has been used to put a bound on the hadronic form factor that enters the extraction of @xmath10 from semileptonic decays , can not be correct , due to a mismatch of infrared and ultraviolet renormalons . in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we show that renormalon contributions cancel in inclusive , current - induced decays of hadrons containing a heavy quark .",
    "this proves a conjecture of bigi et al .",
    "@xcite , although we do not agree on the details of the cancellation . in sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , we summarize our results and give some conclusions .",
    "given a perturbative series for some quantity @xmath11 in terms of the coupling constant @xmath12 renormalized at some scale @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the first coefficient of the @xmath16-function , we define the borel transform @xmath17 of @xmath11 by @xmath18 if the series is borel summable , the function @xmath11 can be reconstructed from its borel transform using the integral relation @xmath19 however , if the coefficients @xmath20 in ( [ fseries ] ) develop a factorial divergence for large @xmath21 , the borel transform @xmath22 can have singularities on the integration contour , and the nave borel summation fails .",
    "in such a case , the result of the integration depends on a regularization ( or resummation ) prescription , and @xmath11 is not uniquely defined in terms of @xmath17 .    in qcd , one source of divergence in the expansion coefficients of a perturbative series",
    "is related to higher - order diagrams in which a virtual gluon line with momentum @xmath23 is dressed by a number of fermion , gluon and ghost loops .",
    "expansion to obtain a consistent renormalon calculus , see below . ]",
    "effectively , this introduces the running coupling constant @xmath24 at the vertices .",
    "since the coupling constant increases for low momenta because of asymptotic freedom , the insertion of additional bubbles drives the gluon line to increasingly softer momentum , i.e.the infrared region in feynman integrals becomes more important .",
    "when the running coupling constant is expressed in terms of a fixed coupling constant renormalized at some large scale @xmath13 , using @xmath25^{n+1 }      \\bigg ( { \\beta_0\\over 4\\pi}\\,\\ln{\\mu^2\\over k^2 } \\bigg)^n \\,,\\ ] ] the appearance of powers of large logarithms leads to a factorial divergence in the expansion coefficients @xmath20 in ( [ fseries ] ) .",
    "associated with this are renormalon singularities in the borel transform @xmath17 .    in our case , the renormalon singularities will occur as single poles on the real axis in the borel plane .",
    "poles on the positive real axis , which arise from the low - momentum region of feynman diagrams , are called infrared renormalons .",
    "let us denote the positions of these poles by @xmath26 and their residues by @xmath27 , so that @xmath28 where the ellipses represent terms that are regular for @xmath29 .",
    "for the calculation of the inverse borel transform from ( [ btinv ] ) , we may write the pole denominators in terms of a principle value and a @xmath30-function contribution : @xmath31 here , @xmath32 is a complex number which depends on the regularization prescription .",
    "for instance , one may choose one of the following regularizations ( with @xmath33 ) @xmath34 one may also choose the principal value prescription itself , in which case @xmath35 .",
    "we write the regularized form of the borel transform as @xmath36 where by definition @xmath37 contains the pole terms regularized with a principle value prescription , and all ambiguity resulting from the freedom to use a different prescription resides in the @xmath30-function contributions .",
    "the inverse borel transformation then leads to @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inverse borel transform of @xmath37 . in the last step ,",
    "we have used the one - loop expression @xmath40 for the running coupling constant . ) and ( [ deltaf ] ) become exact in the large-@xmath41 limit . ]",
    "these definitions make explicit the fact that terms which depend on the regularization prescription are exponentially small in the coupling constant , i.e.  they have the form of power corrections .",
    "the leading asymptotic behaviour is determined by the nearest infrared renormalon pole at @xmath42 .",
    "we define the renormalon ambiguity @xmath43 as the coefficient of @xmath44 : @xmath45 it is a measure of the intrinsic ambiguity in the quantity @xmath46 arising from the necessity to regularize the divergent behaviour of perturbation theory in large orders .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to trace how these leading ( in powers of @xmath47 ) ambiguities cancel in hqet predictions for physical quantities .",
    "although the appearance of renormalons can hardly be doubted on physical grounds , a rigorous proof of their existence does not exist even in field theories that are much simpler than qcd .",
    "for this reason , various forms of large-@xmath48 expansions have become the state - of - the - art approach to study renormalon singularities . in qcd",
    ", one uses @xmath9 as an expansion parameter , where @xmath41 is the number of light quark flavours . in the large-@xmath41 limit ,",
    "the insertions of fermion loops in a gluon propagator are the only higher - order contributions that have to be retained in the perturbative expansion , since they involve powers of @xmath49 .",
    "unfortunately , qcd in the large-@xmath41 limit is not an asymptotically free theory ; the first coefficient of the @xmath16-function becomes negative for @xmath50 .",
    "however , it is believed that although the @xmath9 expansion is not adequate to describe the dynamics of qcd , it can still be used to locate the position of the renormalon poles in the borel plane . in other words , the hope is that tracing the fermionic contribution to the @xmath16-function one gets the remaining contributions for free , and that using the correct value of @xmath51 in ( [ btinv ] ) gives the right result .",
    "although there exists no proof of this assertion , we will accept it as a working hypothesis .    in the large-@xmath41 limit",
    ", the summation of bubbles can be performed directly on the gluon propagator . in landau gauge , and after renormalization of the fermion loops , the borel transform of the resummed propagator takes the form @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath13 is the renormalization scale , and @xmath53 is a scheme - dependent constant . in the @xmath54 scheme , @xmath55 .",
    "consider now an arbitrary correlation function without external gluons . to order @xmath9 , all its dependence on",
    "the coupling constant @xmath56 comes from diagrams containing one resummed gluon propagator .",

    "in general , these are complicated implicit equations . however , since the self - energy is of order @xmath9 with respect to the bare mass , one can replace @xmath60 by @xmath59 on the right - hand side , thereby neglecting terms of order @xmath61 .",

    "the functions @xmath73 and @xmath74 depend on the renormalization scheme specified by the superscript `` r '' . in the @xmath54 scheme , one has @xmath75 and @xmath76 . for the discussion of renormalon singularities these functions are irrelevant .",
    "the asymptotic behaviour of the perturbative expansions for @xmath1 and @xmath77 is determined by the nearest infrared renormalon pole , which is located at @xmath78 . according to ( [ deltaf ] ) ,",
    "it leads to intrinsic ambiguities given by @xmath79 note that the product @xmath80 is scheme - independent .",
    "after this lengthy introduction into the problem , let us now turn to the construction of the hqet @xcite@xcite .",
    "a heavy quark interacting with light degrees of freedom inside a hadron is almost on - shell .",
    "it is then natural to split its momentum into a `` large '' and a `` small '' piece according to @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the velocity of the hadron , and @xmath59 is some choice of the heavy quark mass discussed in detail below . for",
    "the moment let us just require that the components of the residual momentum @xmath23 are much smaller than @xmath59 .",
    "one then proceeds by introducing a velocity - dependent heavy quark field @xmath83 , which is related to the original field @xmath84 by @xmath85 the effective lagrangian for @xmath86 reads @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the residual mass term for the heavy quark in the effective theory .",
    "it appears since there is a freedom in the choice of the expansion parameter @xmath59 in ( [ redef ] ) .",
    "one can show that in physical matrix elements only the combination @xmath89 appears , i.e.  different choices of @xmath59 are compensated by different values of @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "the ellipses in ( [ leff ] ) represent terms that contain additional powers of @xmath90 or @xmath91 .",
    "if one arranges things in such a way that the components of @xmath23 and @xmath88 are of order @xmath92 and independent of @xmath59 , this construction provides a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , the leading terms in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) are then invariant under a spin - flavour symmetry group . to this end",
    ", the heavy quark mass @xmath59 used in the field redefinition ( [ redef ] ) must be a `` physical '' mass such as the pole mass , the mass of the lightest hadron that contains the heavy quark , or any other definition that differs from the pole mass by an amount of order @xmath2 .",
    "the residual mass term is given by @xmath94 ; i.e.  if one chooses the pole mass to construct the hqet , the residual mass vanishes , and to any finite order in perturbation theory the effective heavy quark propagator has a pole at @xmath95 .",
    "however , from our previous considerations we know that there is an intrinsic ambiguity of order @xmath2 in the definition of the pole mass , once non - perturbative effects are taken into account .",
    "hence , if one wants to write down the lagrangian of the hqet without specifying a particular borel summation prescription , one can do this for the price of an ambiguous residual mass term @xcite . to be specific ,",
    "let us construct the hqet using the heavy quark mass defined with a principle value prescription to regularize the poles in the borel plane [ cf .",
    "( [ fstar ] ) ] .",
    "it then follows that @xmath96 the ambiguity associated with the definition of the pole mass shows up in the form of an ambiguous parameter in the effective lagrangian ( [ leff ] ) . at first sight",
    "this may seem a problem : how can one derive unambiguous predictions from a lagrangian that contains an ambiguous parameter ?",
    "the answer is that the effective theory has to be matched onto the full theory at some large momentum scale . in this process there appear coefficient functions multiplying the operators of the hqet .",
    "the ambiguous residual mass term is required to cancel ambiguities in these coefficient functions .",
    "the important point to note is that @xmath88 is independent of @xmath59 and thus does not break the flavour symmetry of the effective lagrangian .",
    "the way in which the residual mass enters the @xmath0 expansion has been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us come back , at this point , to the original formulation of wilson s ope @xcite , in which renormalons never appear .",
    "introducing a hard factorization scale @xmath13 in the construction of the hqet would yield a residual mass term of the form @xmath97 . likewise",
    ", hadronic matrix elements in the effective theory as well as the wilson coefficient functions would have a power - like dependence on @xmath13 , in such a way that the factorization scale disappears from the final predictions for physical quantities .",
    "this is the content of the renormalization - group equation . in this formulation ,",
    "the parameters of the theory are not plagued by ambiguities , but they depend on the arbitrary parameter @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the precise form of this dependence ( for instance , the coefficient of the @xmath98 term in @xmath88 ) depends on how exactly the hard cutoff is implemented in feynman diagrams .",
    "hence , there is a similar arbitrariness in the definition of these parameters as in the case of the practical form of the ope , which contains renormalons .",
    "finally , we note that chosing @xmath99 as a factorization scale ( as it was proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) breaks the flavour symmetry of the effective lagrangian ( through the residual mass term ) and is thus not a viable choice in processes that involve more than one heavy quark flavour .",
    "in this section we investigate how renormalons appear in the hadronic matrix elements that describe current - induced transitions between two hadrons containing heavy quarks with masses @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",
    "these matrix elements are of the form @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 denote the velocities of the hadrons .",
    "the quantum numbers of the light degrees of freedom are assumed to be the same in the initial and final state , but are otherwise arbitrary .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the cases of vector or axial vector currents ( @xmath105 or @xmath106 ) .",
    "this covers semileptonic weak decays such as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    in the hqet , the currents which mediate these transitions obey an expansion in a series of local operators multiplied by coefficient functions .",
    "these functions depend upon the heavy quark masses , the renormalization scale , and the hadron velocity product @xmath109 .",
    "a particular property of heavy - to - heavy transitions is that the coefficients of the operators of dimension four are all related to the coefficients of the dimension - three operators @xcite .",
    "the reason for this is an invariance of the effective theory under reparametrization of the heavy quark momentum @xcite . as an example , we give the exact form of the expansion of the vector current to order @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 . a similar expansion with coefficients @xmath112 , and with @xmath113 inserted after whatever object carries the lorentz index @xmath13 , holds for the axial vector current .",
    "the symbols @xmath114 represent combinations of a gauge - covariant derivative and the residual mass term .",
    "they are defined as @xcite @xmath115    we will show below that the coefficient functions @xmath116 of the dimension - three operators contain infrared renormalons at @xmath78 , corresponding to power behaviour of order @xmath117 or @xmath118 . in order for the physical heavy - to - heavy transition amplitudes to be unambiguous , we have to require that these renormalons be compensated by ultraviolet renormalons in hqet matrix elements of dimension - four operators .",
    "this requirement is analogous to the renormalization - group equation in wilson s ope .",
    "the complete set of dimension - four operators consists of the local current operators in ( [ current ] ) as well as operators containing the time - ordered product of a dimension - three operator with a @xmath0 insertion from the effective lagrangian @xcite , which at this order is given by @xcite @xmath119 however , a cancellation of renormalon ambiguities can only occur between terms that have the structure of matrix elements of local dimension - three operators .",
    "in other words , only the matrix elements of dimension - four operators that can mix with lower dimensional operators can contain ultraviolet renormalons .    in heavy - to - heavy transitions ,",
    "the ultraviolet renormalons in the matrix elements of the local dimension - four operators can be related to the infrared renormalon in the pole mass .",
    "using the equation of motion of the hqet , @xmath120 , as well as an integration by parts , one can show that @xcite @xmath121 where @xmath67 may be an arbitrary dirac matrix .",
    "the ellipses represent terms that vanish upon contraction with @xmath122 or @xmath123 .",
    "these terms can not be written in the form of matrix elements of local operators .",
    "hence , as explained above , they must be free of renormalons .",
    "as an example , consider the case of the ground - state pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "there , the matrix elements of local dimension - three operators can be parametrized in terms of the isgur - wise function @xcite : @xmath124 where @xmath125 are the tensor wave functions defined in ref .",
    "the matrix elements of local dimension - four operators can be written as @xcite @xmath126 note that the feynman rules of the hqet imply that there can not appear dirac matrices next to @xmath67 under the trace with the meson wave functions .",
    "obviously , the structure of the trace associated with the function @xmath127 is different from the structure of the trace in ( [ iwdef ] ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath127 does not contain an ultraviolet renormalon at @xmath78 .",
    "let us now come back to the terms shown explicitly in ( [ lamdm ] ) .",
    "they have the structure of matrix elements of the local dimension - three operators .",
    "for instance , in the case of the second operator on the right - hand side in ( [ current ] ) one has @xmath128 , and between the heavy quark spinors one can replace @xmath129 by @xmath130 .",
    "the parameter @xmath131 denotes the asymptotic value of the difference between the hadron and heavy quark pole masses , which is flavour - independent .",
    "note that this parameter is independent of the choice of the expansion parameter @xmath59 used in the construction of the hqet @xcite .",
    "however , because of its dependence on the pole mass it does contain an ultraviolet renormalon @xcite . using ( [ dmexpr ] ) , we find that the corresponding ambiguity in @xmath132 is given by @xmath133    next consider the matrix elements of the operators containing the time - ordered product of two local operators .",
    "an insertion of the kinetic operator @xmath134 into a matrix element of a local dimension - three operator does not affect the transformation properties under the lorentz group and heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "the effect of such an insertion is simply a multiplicative renormalization of the original matrix element .",
    "we define a function @xmath135 by is usually written as @xmath136 @xcite , where @xmath137 is the isgur - wise function @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath138 clearly , these time - ordered products can mix with the dimension - three operators under renormalization .",
    "this is obvious if a dimensionful regulator is employed .",
    "but even in dimensional regularization , it can be seen from the renormalization - group equation for the function @xmath135 , which contains an inhomogeneous term proportional to @xmath132 @xcite : @xmath139 here @xmath140 denotes the velocity - dependent anomalous dimension of the currents in the effective theory @xcite : @xmath141 + o(\\alpha_s^2 ) \\ , ; \\nonumber\\\\     r(w ) & = & { 1\\over\\sqrt{w^2 - 1}}\\,\\ln\\big ( w + \\sqrt{w^2 - 1 } \\big ) \\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ krge ] ) , it follows that the function @xmath135 contains an ultraviolet renormalon at @xmath78 .",
    "let us denote its renormalon ambiguity by @xmath142 .",
    "vector current conservation implies that @xmath135 must vanish at zero recoil ( @xmath143 ) @xcite , and this requires that @xmath144 finally , we note that insertions of the chromo - magnetic operator change the transformation properties of matrix elements in such a way that there is no mixing with matrix elements of lower dimensional operators @xcite .",
    "hence , the hqet functions that parameterize these matrix elements are free of ultraviolet renormalons .",
    "this is again special to the case of heavy - to - heavy transitions , where the spin symmetry applies to both the initial and final state .",
    "we can now equate the infrared and ultraviolet renormalon ambiguities to derive a set of conditions that have to be fulfilled in order to obtain unambiguous predictions for the physical heavy - to - heavy transition form factors . separating the terms associated with different lorentz structures , we obtain from ( [ current ] ) , ( [ lamdm ] ) , ( [ dlambar ] ) and ( [ kdef ] ) : @xmath145 we use a short - hand notation where we omit the superscript @xmath146 or @xmath147 on the coefficient functions , and where upper ( lower ) signs refers to the coefficients of the vector ( axial vector ) current . in total , there are thus six relations .",
    "we find it useful to solve for @xmath148 using the relation for @xmath149 , and to eliminate @xmath150 from the remaining relations .",
    "this leads to @xmath151 as well as @xmath152 equation ( [ delk ] ) determines the structure of the ultraviolet renormalon in the hadronic form factor @xmath135 in terms of the infrared renormalon in the pole mass and in the coefficient function @xmath153 .",
    "since we are not able to calculate the hadronic form factor @xmath135 from first principles ( not even using a @xmath9 expansion ) , we can not check this relation , but we can use it to compute @xmath150 given a calculation of @xmath154 and @xmath149 .",

    ", a compensation of infrared and ultraviolet renormalons is not possible .",
    "the existence of such relations is non - trivial and is a consequence of the strong constraints imposed by heavy quark symmetry on the structure of the weak decay form factors in heavy - to - heavy transitions .",
