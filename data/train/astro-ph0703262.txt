    "a well - motivated conjecture is that electrically neutral weakly interacting particles generated in the big - bang origin of the universe through their gravitation triggered the formation of galaxies @xcite .",
    "this process generically leads to the formation of halos of dark matter ( dm ) surrounding the galaxies .",
    "the dm halo in which the milky way galaxy is embedded is the subject of this paper .",
    "detailed study of the dm halo surrounding the galaxy is particularly important because it might provide insights into the more general problem of dm in the universe and the role of dm in the formation and dynamics of the diverse galactic systems .    in constructing theoretical models of the dm halo of the galaxy",
    "one must keep in mind that the visible matter in the form of stars and gas in the galaxy not only act as tracers of the galactic potential but also contribute to it , dominating it at galactocentric distances below a few kiloparsecs and diminishing in importance at very large distances where dm is the main contributor .",
    "it is the interplay between these two components that finally determines the spatial distribution of both the visible and the dark matter components of the galaxy .    what is the mass of the galaxy including its halo ?",
    "how far does the halo extend ?",
    "these are some of the crucial questions that are addressed in this paper using a novel method that uses the dynamics of the dwarf - spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies in the gravitational potential of the galaxy together with a model of the phase space structure of the dm halo of the galaxy that incorporates the gravitational potential of the visible matter as well as that of the dm particles in a self - consistent manner . early work on using the satellites of the milky way as tracers of its gravitational potential includes @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ( hereafter we99 ) .",
    "one of the most effective probes of the gravitational potential of the dm halo of the galaxy is the behavior of its rotation curve , the circular rotation speed as a function of the galactocentric distance @xmath5 .",
    "however , direct measurements of the galactic rotation curve are available only up to @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "a proper understanding of the nature of the dm halo requires the knowledge of the behavior of the rotation curve at large galactocentric distances .",
    "it is in this context that the dynamics of dsphs , which lie beyond several tens of kpc from the galactic center , play an important role in the study of the nature of the dm halo .    the central idea and",
    "the main results of this paper can be summarized as follows : the dsphs , comprising of mostly old population stars with total visible masses in the range @xmath7  @xmath8 and radii in the range 1  2 kpc , populate a region extending from @xmath9 to @xmath10 from the galactic center .",
    "they are relatively low density systems that are susceptible to tidal break - up in the gravitational potential of the galaxy . even with the additional mass provided by the dm in these systems they are near the threshold of tidal break - up in the gravitational field of the galaxy @xcite . during the early epochs following the formation of the galaxy and its satellites ,",
    "a subset of the dsphs that had close perigalactic passages must have been tidally disrupted leaving behind a population which do not approach the galaxy too closely .",
    "thus , the present day phase space distribution of the dsphs should be such as to be depleted of orbits with large radial velocities , @xmath11 , which would have brought them closer to the centre of the galaxy than a certain minimum galactocentric distance @xmath12 .",
    "this makes their velocity distribution skewed in favor of transverse velocities , @xmath13 . the velocity skewness or anisotropy parameter , @xmath14 , can in general",
    "be defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the total velocity of a satellite and @xmath11 is its radial component , and the angular brackets denote the average over a population of these satellites .",
    "this parameter can be theoretically calculated for dsphs as a function of the parameter @xmath12 that parametrizes the spatial restrictions imposed on the allowed orbits of the dsphs for an assumed form of the phase space distribution function of the dsphs and a given potential of the galaxy .",
    "a comparison of the calculated radial distribution of the dsphs with the observed one then allows us to determine the most likely value of the parameter @xmath12 and thereby obtain an estimate of the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath14 of the dsphs .",
    "this , coupled with their observed radial velocities , then gives us an estimate of @xmath17 of the dsphs .",
    "this in turn allows us to infer , using the virial theorem as formulated by @xcite , the circular rotation speed @xmath18 of any tracer object in the potential of the galaxy at galactocentric distances spanned by the dsphs .",
    "this analysis yields an estimate of @xmath18 of @xmath19 at galactocentric distances of @xmath20 .    our dynamical model for the gravitational potential of the galaxy including its dm halo in which the dsphs move is based on simple assumptions about the phase space structure of the dm particles , and",
    "incorporates the gravitational potential of the visible matter as well as that of the dm particles in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the phase space distribution function ( df ) of the finite - sized dm halo model we assume in this paper is the truncated or `` lowered '' isothermal df ( `` king model '' ) ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this model has three parameters , namely , the density , @xmath21 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath22 , of the dm particles at the solar location , and the radius , @xmath23 , of the dm halo .",
    "we determine these model parameters by demanding that the model not only yield the observed spatial distribution of the dsphs but also at the same time be consistent with the directly observed rotation speeds of the galaxy at all galactocentric distances . this analysis yields good fit to all the available observational data for values of the king model dm halo parameters , @xmath24 ",

    "this paper is organized as follows : we begin , in section [ sec : spatial_df_sats ] , by reviewing the spatial distribution of the satellites and pointing out several of its relevant features . in section",
    "[ sec : truncated_df_dsph ] we derive the constraint equations pertaining to orbits which are confined between certain minimal and maximal galactocentric distances in the galactic potential and then discuss how these constraints influence the distribution of dsphs in phase space . in section [ sec : virial ]",
    "we briefly review the virial theorem due to @xcite which allows us to estimate the circular rotation speed of any tracer object at large galactocentric distances if the radial velocities of an ensemble of objects at those distances are known . our self - consistent model for the dm halo of the galaxy",
    "is described in section [ sec : dmhalo_model_math ] .",
    "the rotation curves for various different values of the relevant parameters of the dm halo model are presented in section [ sec : rotation_curve ] , where we also discuss how the measured rotation speeds allow us to determine one of the parameters of the model , namely , the dm density in the solar neighborhood .",
    "we then describe in section [ sec : constraints_from_dsphs ] how the dynamics of the dsphs can be used to constrain the parameters of the dm halo model by comparing the theoretically calculated radial distribution of the dsphs with their observed radial distribution .",
    "the estimates of the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath14 and the resulting lower limits on the average circular rotation speeds at large galactocentric distances spanned by the dsphs are obtained in section [ sec : j_estimation ] .",
    "a summary of the main results of the paper is presented in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "three appendices provide additional material that reinforces the underlying physical basis of the results obtained in the main body of the paper .",
    "a careful compilation of 27 satellites of the galaxy has been made by we99 , and our analysis in this paper is based on the astronomical data available on this sample of 27 objects  .",
    "we define the radial number distribution of the satellites through the relation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the spatial number density distribution .",
    "observationally , @xmath30 just represents the number of satellites in unit interval in @xmath31 at a radial distance @xmath31 from the galactic centre irrespective of their angular coordinates .",
    "this one dimensional distribution is less subject to statistical uncertainties than higher dimensional distributions such as the phase space distribution .",
    "we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_all_tf ] the observed distance distribution of the satellites .",
    "even a visual inspection of this distribution is quite revealing : there is a sharp peak comprising of 12 satellites at around @xmath32 .",
    "then there is a group of 15 satellites distributed as a broad peak at around @xmath33 , with a long tail extending beyond 200 kpc . on the same figure we also display the best fitting `` shadow tracer '' tf model of we99 and",
    "note that the sharp first peak , the dip at around 50 kpc , and the second peak at around 90 kpc are not well represented by the model . in fact it appears that no model that predicts a smooth monotonic decrease in the number distribution will fit the observations , and one needs to consider that there are two distinct populations corresponding to each of the peaks and separated by a low density region centered around 50 kpc .",
    "how can one maintain two such spatially separated populations over the age of the galaxy @xmath34 10 billion years ? unless there are dynamical constraints , the features such as two separate peaks and a depleted region in between will get smoothed out over a few orbital periods , that is , well within a billion years . an important clue as to the possible dynamical reasons for imposing these features on the distance distribution of the satellites stems from the fact that all the dsph galaxies lie in the second more distant region and none nearby . as noted in the introduction ,",
    "the dsphs are highly susceptible to tidal break up in the gravitational field of the galaxy .",
    "the key idea is that at an early epoch when the galaxy and its satellites were being formed , perhaps even prior to the complete condensation of the satellites into their present configurations , a dynamically chosen subset of the satellites were tidally disrupted by the centrally condensed galaxy .",
    "a fraction of the satellites might have been tidally stable , as would be the case for globular clusters , for example , which might have settled down into the distribution peaked at around 30 kpc that we see today .    as for the objects populating the second peak around 90 kpc , it is likely that these represent a subgroup of objects , which even though were weekly bound at the time of their formation , survived tidal disruption as their orbits did not ever bring them close to the central galaxy . the other subgroup with more radial trajectories , on the other hand , were tidally disrupted , as their trajectories brought them much closer to the galaxy where the tidal fields are much stronger .",
    "thus the tidal effects on this second subgroup caused a reduction in their densities at short galactocentric distances , with the concomitant effect on their phase space distribution whereby asymmetries were introduced into their velocity distribution .",
    "these considerations are relevant to any model for the formation of the satellites that dynamically removes progenitors which approached the central galaxy too closely in the past .",
    "we may look for this effect in the data available on the proper motions of six satellites given in table 3 of we99 , three of which are dsphs . from these data",
    "( see also @xcite ) , it is straightforward to estimate the asymmetry parameter @xmath14 defined in equation ( [ j_def1 ] ) , which yields @xmath35 for all six objects and",
    "@xmath36 for the three dsphs , as compared to the value @xmath37 for an isotropic distribution of velocities .",
    "note , however , that because the data sample is small and uncertainties in the proper motion measurements sizeable the above estimate of @xmath14 is to be treated with caution , even though the data do seem to indicate the possible existence of a velocity anisotropy favoring transverse velocities in the distribution of the dsphs .",
    "as shown later in this paper , a more robust estimate of the asymmetry parameter @xmath14 can be obtained from the analysis of the number distribution @xmath30 of the satellites without any reference to the data on the radial velocities nor on the proper motions of the satellites .",
    "our @xmath14 parameter is related to the parameter @xmath38 defined in we99 through the relation @xmath39 which gives , for the same data set as mentioned above , @xmath40 for all six objects and @xmath41 for the three dsphs .",
    "note the negative values of @xmath38 signifying possible existence of a velocity anisotropy in favor of transverse velocities over radial velocities .    in the next section we begin by deriving the kinematic constraints on the orbits of dsphs and",
    "go on to show how the two observational features , namely , their depletion at short galactocentric distances and the velocity anisotropy get related to each other .",
    "let us consider the motion of dsphs in the potential of the galaxy with its dm halo .",
    "consider then an initial phase space distribution function ( df ) @xmath42 for the dsphs , from which all representative points corresponding to orbits which do not satisfy the constraint @xmath43 have been removed . here",
    "@xmath31 is the radial coordinate , and @xmath12 and @xmath44 are the perigalacticon and the apogalacticon of the orbits of the population of dsphs .",
    "for such a truncated df we wish to evaluate the skewness parameter @xmath14 defined in equation ( [ j_def1 ] ) .    now , referring to figure  [ fig : dsph_orbit_fig ] we can write the equations for the conservation of energy and angular momentum of a dsph s motion as @xmath45 and @xmath46}\\ , , \\label{j_eqn}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the energy per unit mass , @xmath48 the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath13 the transverse velocity and @xmath49 is total gravitational potential of the galaxy .    manipulating equations ( [ e_eqn ] ) , ( [ j_eqn ] ) we can write @xmath50\\right\\}\\ , . \\label{v_t_eqn}\\ ] ] the spatial restriction imposed on the orbits by equation ( [ r_constraint ] ) implies constraints on the velocity components @xmath11 and @xmath13 , which can be deduced as follows : first , note that the orbit having the maximum transverse velocity at @xmath12 will be the one that permits the maximum radial velocity at any @xmath31 . considering this `` maximal '' orbit , shown schematically in figure  [ fig : dsph_orbit_fig ] , and using the energy and angular momentum conservation equations given above , it is easy to show that the maximum radial velocity , @xmath51 , at any @xmath31 is given by @xmath52 -2\\left[\\phi(r)-\\phi(\\rmin)\\right]\\ , .",

    "the minimum @xmath53 at @xmath59 , @xmath60 , has to be such that the radial velocity at @xmath12 for this orbit , @xmath61 , vanishes , and the kinetic energy at @xmath12 is completely due to transverse motion .",
    "this gives @xmath62\\right\\}\\ , .",
    "\\label{vtminsq_eq}\\ ] ] notice , as before , @xmath63 .    the constraint equations ( [ vrmaxsq_eq ] ) , ( [ vtmaxsq_eq ] ) and ( [ vtminsq_eq ] ) as functions of @xmath31 are displayed for illustration in figure [ fig : v2_limits_fig ] for a simple representative galactic potential at large @xmath31 of the form @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are dimensionful constants .",
    "we have found that this simple `` softened keplerian '' potential with appropriately chosen values of the normalization constants , @xmath67 and @xmath68 roughly reproduces the potential of the galaxy at large galactocentric distances @xmath69 .",
    "notice that @xmath70 vanishes at @xmath12 and @xmath44 and is less than @xmath71 for considerable distances from the end points , and it is only at intermediate distances that @xmath70 becomes larger than @xmath72 and @xmath71 for large values of @xmath73 .",
    "thus it is clear that such kinematic restrictions on the population will yield one with a large value of the asymmetry parameter @xmath14 defined in equation ( [ j_def1 ] ) .",
    "we should emphasize that the choice of the potential ( [ phi_soft_kepler_pot ] ) here is merely to illustrate the general nature of the constraint equations . in the actual calculations and the results presented in this paper the potential",
    "is calculated self - consistently using a dynamical model of the galaxy described in section [ sec : dmhalo_model_math ] .",
    "the kinematic constraints derived above will immediately impose asymmetries on the phase space distribution function of the dsphs .",
    "writing the primitive isotropic phase space distribution function of the dsphs as @xmath74 , the spatial number density distribution of the dsphs is given by @xmath75 for @xmath76 , and @xmath77 otherwise .",
    "the radial number distribution @xmath30 of the dsphs is then given by equation ( [ n_r_dr_def ] ) .",
    "similarly the velocity skewness or asymmetry parameter @xmath14 defined in equation ( [ j_def1 ] ) is given by @xmath78    before we calculate these constrained distributions and the skewness parameter from a self - consistent dynamical model , we will discuss the importance of the skewness parameter @xmath14 in constraining the circular speed and in turn the galactic potential at large distances .",
    "the estimate of the skewness parameter @xmath14 from the observed data allows us to derive the circular rotation speeds @xmath18 in the galactic potential at distances spanned by the dsphs . following @xcite",
    "consider the identity @xmath79 applicable to any particle moving in a gravitational potential @xmath49 . here",
    "@xmath80 denotes the velocity vector of a particle at the position @xmath81 with respect to the center , and @xmath82 is the circular velocity that would balance the radial component of gravity at the radius @xmath31 . averaging equation ( [ lf_identity ] ) over an ensemble of particles with position vectors @xmath83 and noting that @xmath84 for a system of particles in virial equilibrium ( @xmath85 being the moment of inertia ) , one gets @xmath86    thus , by measuring @xmath17 for an ensemble of objects at large galactocentric distances we may estimate the value of @xmath87 at those distances . as emphasized by @xcite",
    ", the validity of this theorem does not require that the potential be self - generated by the ensemble of particles under consideration .",
    "thus , in general , we can write , @xmath88    it is worth emphasizing that in this formulation of the virial theorem the kinetic energy gets equated to @xmath89 rather than to the potential energy as in the standard formulation .",
    "the root mean square of the radial velocities , @xmath90 , can be estimated from a compilation of the radial velocities of various astronomical objects given in table 2 and 3 of we99 , for example .",
    "this gives @xmath91 .",
    "the errors we expect in the determination of this @xmath90 are primarily systematic , even though the smallness of the sample will also contribute to the uncertainties . referring to the extensive review by @xcite we note that the typical accuracy with which the radial velocities with respect to the solar system barycentre are quoted is @xmath92 .",
    "thus the errors are primarily due to the uncertainty in the circular velocity of the local standard of rest . keeping in mind",
    "that the value of the circular rotation velocity at solar circle quoted in literature is in the range 200  220 @xmath93 , and that the component of this velocity in the direction of the satellite is to be subtracted from the observed radial velocity with respect to the solar system , there would be an additional uncertainty of @xmath94 on the average in the estimate of @xmath90 .",
    "the measurements of proper motions are less certain and provide estimates of the transverse velocities as seen from the solar system .",
    "since the solar system is at a distance of @xmath95 from the galactic centre we need to make use of both the observed components of the velocities to determine the radial velocity with respect to the galactic centre .",
    "in so far as the distances of the satellites are much larger than 8.5 kpc , the transformations of the velocity components from the heliocentric to the galactocentric system do not add additional uncertainties except in rare instances .",
    "thus the determination of @xmath90 is reasonably robust .",
    "on the other hand , the transverse velocities are to be estimated from the measurements of proper motions and are subject to greater uncertainties .",
    "this , coupled with the fact that there are only a small number of dsphs for which proper motion data are available , makes reliable observational determination of the anisotropy parameter @xmath14 from direct measurements of the radial and transverse velocities somewhat difficult . we shall instead estimate the parameter @xmath14 in section [ sec : j_estimation ] below from the observed radial number distribution , @xmath30 , of the dsphs , which was introduced in section [ sec : spatial_df_sats ] .    to proceed further ,",
    "we next describe the model we have adopted for calculating the potential of the galaxy in which the dsphs move .",
    "both the visible matter and the dark matter contribute to the potential of the galaxy , even though their relative contributions vary , with visible matter dominating at galactocentric distances below @xmath96 and the dark matter contribution increasing slowly with distance until beyond @xmath97 it is the dominant contributor .",
    "whereas the density distribution of visible matter may be directly inferred from the astronomical observations , the density distribution of dark matter has to be deduced by somewhat more involved methods .",
    "the spatial distribution of the dm particles is dictated by their velocity distribution and the overall gravitational potential to which they also contribute depending on their density distribution .",
    "thus one should ensure internal consistency between their velocity distribution and their density whose contribution to the potential when added to that of the visible matter should yield the overall potential .",
    "the overall gravitational potential of the galaxy is well determined by the observed rotation curve of the galaxy at least up to @xmath34 15 kpc .",
    "the method using the dsphs discussed in the previous section will help us to determine the potential up to distances of @xmath34 100  200 kpc . in order to ensure the overall self - consistency we need a dynamical model , and to this end we start by making a convenient ansatz regarding the functional form of the phase space distribution of the particles constituting the dm halo .",
    "we then derive the structure of the halo by solving the combined poisson - boltzmann equation which involves the known gravitational potential of the visible matter of stars and gas of the galaxy and the as yet undetermined potential of the dm halo .",
    "the solutions are a parametrized family of functions representing the potential due to the dark matter distribution .",
    "we may add to this the known contribution of the visible matter to get the total potential corresponding to different values of the parameters that characterize our dm halo model . by fitting the potential derived from the measurements of the rotation curve and the dsph dynamics",
    ", we can then determine the acceptable range of the parameters of our assumed dm halo model .",
    "we assume that the density distribution of the normal visible matter is known and can be described adequately by a spheroidal bulge superposed on an axisymmetric disc  @xcite .",
    "the density distributions of these are given respectively by    @xmath98    and    @xmath99    where @xmath100 , @xmath5 being the galactocentric distance in the median plane of the disc and @xmath101 the distance normal to the plane .",

    "the true phase space df that describes the dm halo of the galaxy is not known . to make progress we choose a phase - space distribution function ( df ) of the dark matter dictated by the following physical considerations",
    ": it should represent a collisionless system and should allow a parametrization in terms of the three main physical parameters of the halo , namely , the density and velocity dispersion of dark matter at some reference location within the halo , and the size ( radius ) of the halo . the truncated or the so - called `` lowered '' isothermal distribution",

    "note that these lower limits on the rotation speeds are obtained entirely from the dynamics of the dsphs , and are clearly consistent with the rotation curves shown in figures [ fig : rc_fig_mod ] , [ fig : appendix_rc_fig_0.2 ] and [ fig : appendix_rc_fig_0.4 ] for @xmath201 and @xmath202 .    in our analysis thus far in the estimation of @xmath14 we have assumed the df of the dsphs to be isotropic at the epoch of their formation . in appendix [ apndx : j_aniso_df ] we investigate the effects of making the initial df favor radial velocities over transverse velocities .",
    "this analysis indicates that once the df is modified by removing the subset of orbits with small perigalacticons , the resultant distribution function rapidly starts favoring transverse velocities .",
    "an intuitive understanding of the generation of anisotropies favoring transverse velocities as a result of imposing a minimum value on the perigalacticon radius may be gained through a kinematic analysis of elliptical orbits ; this is presented in appendix [ apndx : j_ellipse ] .    from the foregoing analysis , supplemented by the discussions in the appendices a , b and c",
    ", we find that we are able to fit the available data on the rotation curve of the galaxy , the radial distribution of the dwarf spheroidals and the value of the circular rotation speed at @xmath203 estimated from the analysis of the data on dsphs , with a self - consistent model of the galactic dark matter halo in which the phase space distribution function of the dm particles is described by the king ( i.e. , the truncated isothermal ) model , with the following values of the model parameters : @xmath204    whereas we will have to await further astronomical observations to yield a complete , unbiased data set on the dsphs , it is expected that the above estimates , being conservative , will hold .",
    "the above estimates are also consistent with the earlier estimation of these parameters by @xcite using only the rotation curve data of the galaxy up to @xmath205 .",
    "the current set of parameters yields a total mass of the galaxy , including its dm halo , @xmath206 .",
    "the theoretical density distribution of the dark matter particles constituting the halo depends sensitively on the competition between their velocity dispersion and the total gravitational potential generated by the dark and the baryonic matter of the galaxy .",
    "we have exploited this sensitivity to estimate the parameters related to the phase space distribution of the dark matter in the galaxy .",
    "this is carried out within the context of a self - consistent model of the dark matter halo which solves the collisionless boltzmann and poisson equations , in which the density distribution of baryonic matter is taken directly to fit the observations , while a specific functional form  namely , the king or the truncated isothermal model  for the phase space distribution of the dark matter particles in the halo is used .",
    "this dm halo model has three free parameters  the density ( @xmath21 ) and velocity dispersion ( @xmath22 ) in the solar neighborhood and the radius ( @xmath23 ) of the halo .",
    "we have estimated these three parameters by comparing the theoretical predictions with the astronomical observations , namely , ( a ) the rotation curve of the galaxy measured up to @xmath207 and ( b ) the distance and radial velocities of the dwarf spheroidal satellites which probe the galactic gravitational field up to very large distances .",
    "indeed , the dsphs , located as they are at distances well beyond @xmath208 with a broad peak around @xmath203 , provide crucial inputs in fixing the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 of the halo model .",
    "we have shown that the observed paucity of the dsphs at short galactocentric distances imposes constraints on their possible orbits and makes their velocity distribution asymmetrical favoring transverse velocities over radial velocities . a special version of the virial theorem",
    "is then applied to the observed radial velocities of the dsphs to estimate the circular rotation speed at galactocentric distances of @xmath203 .",
    "the self - consistent model reproduces the rotation speed and the observed distance distribution of the dsphs .",
    "whereas one will have to await further astronomical observations which will yield rotation curves with less scatter and a more complete sample of dsphs , the available astronomical data indicates @xmath209 , @xmath201 and @xmath27 for our assumed model of the halo .",
    "improvements on these model parameters could also result from an analysis of the tidal streams surrounding the milky way system .",
    "finally , we emphasize that while the estimates of ( or constraints on ) the dm halo parameters given above have been obtained within the context of a specific assumed model of the phase space distribution function of the dm particles in the galaxy , namely the king model , we believe that other models for the phase space df that are parametrizable in terms of the three coarse - grained parameters as above , and which give similar fits to the observational data on the rotation curve and the number distribution of the dsphs as obtained in this paper , will yield similar values of the three parameters .",
    "this , however , remains to be explicitly demonstrated .",
    "it will thus be interesting to repeat the analysis with various other possible forms of the df for the dm particles in order to assess the robustness of the parameter values or the constraints on them obtained in this paper for the dm halo of the galaxy .",

    "these are shown in figures [ fig : appendix_rc_fig_0.2 ] and [ fig : appendix_rc_fig_0.4 ] .",
    "the dark matter is modeled as having a lowered ( truncated ) isothermal distribution function [ see equations ( [ king_df ] ) and ( [ relative_energy_def ] ) ] which is described by three parameters , namely , ( i ) the dark matter density in the solar neighborhood , @xmath21 , ( ii ) the velocity dispersion in the solar neighborhood , @xmath22 , and ( iii ) the truncation radius , @xmath23 .",
    "in this appendix we investigate the effect of deviations from an initially isotropic velocity distribution of the dsphs , on the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath14 discussed in the main text . specifically , we consider an initial distribution function ( df ) that favors radial orbits and suppresses large transverse velocities .",
    "such dfs can be obtained by introducing a dependence on the angular momentum @xmath210 which is an integral of motion in the relevant potential @xcite . following the prescription in binney and tremaine",
    "let us consider , as an explicit example , an initially anisotropic df for the dsphs obtained by multiplying the isothermal ( and isotropic ) df ( [ f_sat ] ) by a factor @xmath211 with @xmath212 : @xmath213 where @xmath214 .",
    "as before , @xmath152 is the initial velocity dispersion of the satellites , and @xmath153 is the gravitational potential in which the satellites move .",
    "the parameter @xmath215 controls the amount of initial suppression of transverse velocities , with @xmath216 representing the isotropic case discussed in the main body of the paper .",
    "the singularity of the factor @xmath211 at @xmath217 can be treated as usual by suitably softening the factor near the origin .",
    "the exercise now is to impose a lower cutoff on the radial coordinate at @xmath12 and numerically calculate the velocity anisotropy parameter @xmath14 ( as a function of @xmath12 ) given by equation ( [ j_def2 ] ) , using the df ( [ f_sat_aniso ] ) , for various values of the parameter @xmath215 .",

    "we see that the effect of the initial radial anisotropy survives only for small values of @xmath12 . as @xmath12 increases ,",
    "the value of @xmath14 increases rapidly with @xmath12 , the increase being _ steeper _ for larger values of the radial bias parameter @xmath215 .",
    "the above behavior of @xmath14 is easy to understand , when we note that as we try to suppress large values of @xmath53 by suppressing large values of @xmath220 , we are suppressing large values of @xmath31 as well .",
    "stronger the suppression of large @xmath210 , less is the probability of having orbits with large apogalacticons , @xmath221 .",
    "consequently , when orbits having perigalacticons , @xmath222 , less than @xmath12 are removed , we are left with a set of orbits with relatively higher values of the ratio @xmath223 compared to the case when there is no large @xmath31 suppression .",
    "these are nearly circular orbits , for which transverse velocities dominate over radial velocities ( see appendix c for a discussion of @xmath14 in terms of elliptical orbits ) , leading to increasingly larger values of @xmath14 as a function of @xmath12 compared to the case when there is no large @xmath210 ( and consequently large @xmath31 ) suppression .    from the above discussions it is clear that , for the relevant ranges of values of the various parameters , the values of @xmath14 obtained for an initially radially biased df are , in fact , _ larger _ than those for the initially isotropic df .",
    "the values of @xmath14 obtained in the main body of the paper assuming an initially isotropic df are thus conservative estimates .",
    "the orbits of dsphs in the galaxy , in general , will follow rosette like patterns , which may not close .",
    "but for the present purposes let us approximate them as ellipses with various values of apo- and peri - galacticons , @xmath221 and @xmath222 , but confined within the limits @xmath44 and @xmath12 , respectively , as defined in the main text .",
