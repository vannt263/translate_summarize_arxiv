    "ultrahigh energy neutrinos are one of the components of the spectrum of particles that reach earth .",

    "this information can be studied by neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "+ attenuation of neutrinos traversing the earth and their detection depend upon the cross - sections describing the interaction of neutrinos with nucleons and atomic nuclei .",

    "reliable estimate of the ultrahigh energy neutrino cross - sections does therefore require reliable extrapolation of the structure functions towards the region of very small values of @xmath2 and large @xmath9 , i.e. far beyond the region which is currently accessible .",
    "existing estimates of the neutrino cross - sections with structure functions constrained by hera data are based on either dglap @xcite or extended bfkl @xcite _ linear _ evolution which neglects non - linear screening effects @xcite .",
    "those effects are in general expected to slow down the increase of the parton distributions and of the cross sections with decreasing @xmath2 and to reduce their magnitude .",
    "possible implications of screening effects for the estimate of the ultrahigh energy cross - sections have recently been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite with somewhat conflicting conclusions .",
    "thus in refs.@xcite it has been claimed that the screening effects should play negligible role in the estimate of the ultrahigh energy neutrino cross - sections due to the dominance of relatively large scales @xmath10 . on the contrary results obtained in ref . @xcite",
    "seem to imply that they may be significant and , moreover , when combined with the bfkl dynamics can even lead to enhancement of the cross - sections .",
    "+ the purpose of this paper is to present relatively detailed and realistic estimate of the impact of the screening effects on the cross - sections desribing interaction of ultrahigh energy neutrino interactions .",
    "we perform this analysis within the two frameworks which incorporate screening effects , i.e. the golec - biernat - wsthoff ( gbw ) model @xcite and the unified bfkl / dglap scheme @xcite supplemented by the non - linear term in the corresponding evolution equations .",
    "this term will be obtained from the non - linear part of the balitzki - kovchegov ( bk ) equation @xcite . in both cases",

    "the linear qcd evolution generates indefinite increase of gluon distributions with decreasing @xmath2 that implies similar increase of the sea quark distributions and of the structure functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",

    "efficient way of introducing saturation can be realised using the colour dipole framework in which the dis at low @xmath2 is viewed as the result of the interaction of the colour @xmath50 dipole which the gauge bosons fluctuate to as illustrated in fig .",
