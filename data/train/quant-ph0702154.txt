    "physicists and computer scientists working with finite size quantum systems are often interested in properties of _ typical _ states , such as entanglement , entropy , etc . in order to estimate such quantities , one has to endow the set of states ( pure or mixed ) with a certain probability measure and compute averages with respect to this measure .",
    "it has been known for a certain while now that there exists an `` uniform '' ( in a way which will precised later ) measure on the set @xmath0 of pure states of size @xmath1 . however , the situation is less simple when dealing with density matrices : there is no widely accepted candidate for a `` canonical '' measure on the set @xmath2 of all density matrices of size @xmath1 .",
    "one may find in the literature two classes of probabilities on @xmath2 :    * the _ induced measures _",
    ", where random density matrices are obtained by partial tracing a larger random pure state , * the _ metric measures _ , where the measure is the volume element associated to a particular distance on @xmath2 .",
    "depending on the physical nature of the model , one may choose different measures from one class or the other .",
    "in this work we study the measures of the first class .",
    "the induced measures were introduced by braunstein @xcite and studied later by hall @xcite , yczkowski and sommers @xcite . in the first part of this work we provide a rigorous construction of these measures . in the second part",
    ", we give some new explicit and recurrence formulas for the moments and we study the asymptotic behavior of the spectrum of such random density matrices . our approach is based on the connection with the well - known theory of _ wishart _ random matrices .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : pure_states_and_density_matrices ] we recall the construction of the induced measures , adding mathematical rigor to the existing literature . section [ sec : wishart_fixed_size ] is devoted to recalling some results on the wishart ensemble and making explicit the connection with random density matrices .",
    "we deduce the distribution of the eigenvalues and we study the moments . in section [ sec : asymptotics ] we study two models of large random density matrices , providing results on the behavior of the spectrum .",
    "a discussion of the results as well as ideas for generalizing our work are presented at the end of the paper .",
    "we start by introducing and motivating the model of random density matrices that we consider .",
    "as explained in the introduction , one would like to endow the set of density matrices on a complex hilbert space @xmath3 with a `` natural '' probability measure .",
    "it turns out that there is no straightforward way of doing this , so one has to make some additional hypothesis in order for a probability measure to stand out as the most natural one .",
    "our approach here is based on the definition of a density matrix as it is usually understood in the theory of open quantum systems .",
    "we consider that the system described by the density matrix is coupled to an environment and that the compound system is in a random pure state .",
    "more precisely , we shall make two assumptions :    1 .",
    "the system @xmath3 is _ coupled _ to an environment @xmath4 and the compound system @xmath5 is in a pure state @xmath6 .",
    "2 .   the pure state @xmath6 is _ uniformly _ distributed on the set of all pure states on @xmath5 .",
    "the first assumption is motivated by a large class of models considered in physics or quantum information theory .",
    "the general framework is provided by a system @xmath5 in a pure state , isolated from its environment .",
    "suppose that one has access only to the sub - system @xmath3 .",
    "this may happen for several different reasons : @xmath4 may be not accessible ( e.g. @xmath3 and @xmath4 are in distant galaxies ) or @xmath4 may be too complicated to study ( a heat bath or a noisy channel , for example ) . in these situations ,",
    "it is natural to make the assumption ( a1 ) .",
    "let us turn now to the second assumption .",
    "if one has no _ a priori _ information on the systems @xmath3 and @xmath4 , it makes sense to suppose ( a2 ) .",
    "moreover , it turns out that there exists an unique uniform probability measure on the set of pure states of given size , so we shall consider _ uniform _ pure states on the compound system .",
    "however , there are situations when one of the two hypotheses ( a1 ) or ( a2 ) is not physically motivated . for instance , when one has no knowledge of an environment coupled to the system @xmath4 , there is no reason to suppose ( a1 ) .",
    "instead , one should use other probability measures , such as the _ bures measure _ ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . on the other hand , even if ( a1 ) corresponds to the physical reality , one may have extra information on the system @xmath3 or @xmath4 ( or both ) .",
    "for example , it may be that the state of the environment @xmath4 has a particular form ; thus , it makes no sense to assume ( a2 ) and our model would not be adapted to such situations .    in the next section , motivated by the assumption ( a2 )",
    ", we shall construct the uniform measure on the set of pure states of given size .",
    "then , by partial tracing , we shall provide the probability which verifies the assumptions ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) .      in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a pure state is described by a norm one vector in a @xmath1-dimensional complex vector space @xmath3 .",
    "the phase of pure states is not determined , i.e. @xmath7    in order to make this definition rigorous , we introduce the following equivalence relation on @xmath8 : @xmath9    a pure state @xmath6 is an element of the quotient space @xmath10 .",
    "we denote by @xmath0 the set of pure states of size @xmath1 .",
    "as all complex hilbert spaces are isomorphic to @xmath11 , the set @xmath0 is the set of rays in @xmath11 .",
    "we endow @xmath0 with the associated quotient topology and the borel @xmath12-field .",
    "we now turn to the construction of the uniform probability measure on @xmath0 .    as stated in the assumption ( a2 ) , the probability on @xmath0 should be the most _ uniform _ one , as there is no _ a priori _ information on the state @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , as there is no preferred basis of @xmath3 , the uniform measure should be invariant by changes of bases . in our framework ( @xmath3 is a complex hilbert space ) , changes of bases are provided by unitary applications . as a consequence",
    ", we ask that the uniform probability measure should be unitarily invariant .",
    "a measure @xmath13 on @xmath14 is _ unitarily invariant _ if @xmath15 for all unitary @xmath16 and for all borel subset @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that this condition is strong enough to completely specify a measure on @xmath0 , i.e. there is an unique unitarily invariant probability measure on @xmath0 .",
    "this follows from a well - known result in probability theory regarding group actions ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us recall it here .",
    "let @xmath18 be a topological group acting on a topological space @xmath19 .",
    "we call its action _ transitive _ if for all @xmath20 , there exists @xmath21 such that @xmath22 and _ proper _ if for all @xmath21 , the application @xmath23 is proper , i.e. the pre - image of a compact set is compact",
    ". we then have the following    [ th : invariant ] let @xmath18 be a topological group which acts transitively and properly on a topological space @xmath19 .",
    "suppose that both @xmath18 and @xmath19 are locally compact and separable .",
    "then there exists an unique ( up to a constant ) measure @xmath24 on @xmath19 which is @xmath18-invariant .    in order apply this result to our situation",
    ", we consider the action of the unitary group @xmath25 on the set @xmath0 by left multiplication .",
    "we obtain the following proposition .",
    "the action of @xmath26 on @xmath14 is transitive and proper and thus there exists an _",
    "unique _ unitarily invariant probability measure @xmath13 on @xmath14 .",
    "first of all , notice that this action is well defined : the class @xmath27 does not depend on @xmath28 , but only on the class @xmath6 ; we say that the multiplication by an unitary is a _",
    "class application_. in order to show that the action is transitive , consider two classes @xmath6 and @xmath29 and an unitary @xmath16 such that @xmath30 ( such an unitary always exists ) .",
    "it follows then that @xmath31 . finally , the action is compact , as the set @xmath0 is compact and the multiplication applications are continuous .",
    "thus , the action verifies the hypothesis of theorem [ th : invariant ] , and as a consequence there is an unique unitarily invariant measure on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , given the compacity of @xmath0 we can choose the measure of unit mass , which concludes the proof of the proposition .",
    "existence and unicity being settled , one would like to dispose of more concrete descriptions on the distribution @xmath13 .",
    "it turns out that there are two ways of doing that .",
    "first of all , let us recall the definition of a complex gaussian random variable .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath32 be two independent real gaussian random variables of mean @xmath33 and variance @xmath34 . then @xmath35 is said to have a complex gaussian distribution of mean @xmath33 and variance @xmath36 .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the law of @xmath38 .",
    "a complex vector @xmath39 is said to have distribution @xmath40 if the random variables @xmath41 are independent and have distribution @xmath37 .",
    "consider now a complex gaussian vector @xmath42 and the projection application @xmath43 it is well - known in probability theory that the law of @xmath19 is unitarily invariant in @xmath11 .",
    "this property remains valid for the projection @xmath44 and thus the law of @xmath45 is unitarily invariant on @xmath0 . as there is only one unitarily invariant distribution on @xmath0 , we have @xmath46 .    we can also obtain the law @xmath13 from another well - known probability distribution , the _ haar measure _ on @xmath25 . in order to do this , consider a haar - distributed unitary matrix @xmath47 .",
    "obviously , the distribution of @xmath47 is unitarily invariant ; the same will hold true for the first column @xmath32 of @xmath47 and for its class @xmath48 .",
    "thus @xmath48 has distribution @xmath13 .",
    "we sum up these results in the following    [ prop : gaussian ]    1 .",
    "let @xmath19 be a random complex vector of law @xmath40 .",
    "then the class @xmath45 of @xmath19 is distributed along @xmath13 .",
    "2 .   let @xmath47 be a random unitary matrix distributed along the haar measure on @xmath26 and let @xmath32 be the first column of @xmath49 .",
    "then the class @xmath48 has distribution @xmath13 .      in this section",
    "we effectively construct the _ induced measures _ on density matrices that will be studied in the rest of the article .",
    "as stated in the introduction , the induced measure of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath50 is obtained as follows :    * consider a product space @xmath5 of two complex hilbert spaces @xmath3 ( of dimension @xmath1 ) and @xmath4 - the environment - of dimension @xmath50 .",
    "this is the global space _",
    "system + environment_. * take an uniform random pure state @xmath6 on @xmath5 ( see the assumption ( a2 ) ) . *",
    "consider the ( random ) pure density matrix @xmath51 corresponding to the pure state @xmath6 .",
    "* take @xmath52 , the partial trace of @xmath51 with respect to the environment @xmath4 .",
    "the law of the random variable @xmath53 is the desired probability measure , which we shall note @xmath54 .    as in our formalism",
    "@xmath6 is an equivalence class , we shall define the pure density matrix @xmath51 by : @xmath55    clearly , @xmath56 is a class function ( it does not depend on the representant @xmath28 chosen , but only on the class @xmath6 ) , so @xmath51 is well - defined .",
    "the normalizing factor @xmath57 appears because we want the matrix @xmath51 to be trace one ; this could have been avoided by considering a norm one vector @xmath28 , since @xmath58 .",
    "we now turn to the third step of the above construction and recall that the partial trace is the unique application @xmath59 such that @xmath60 its expression for elementary matrices ( @xmath61 ) is @xmath62 = { \\langle b_2 , b_1\\rangle}\\cdot a_1 a_2^*.\\ ] ]    we have now all the elements needed for the definition of the induced measures :    the induced measure of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath50 is the distribution @xmath63 of the random density matrix @xmath64 where @xmath6 is an uniform pure state on @xmath5 of distribution @xmath65 .    in order to get a better understanding of the measure @xmath63",
    ", we write @xmath28 in an orthonormal basis @xmath66 of @xmath5 : @xmath67 thus the matrix @xmath51 has coordinates ( in the same basis ) : @xmath68 after taking the partial trace , we obtain @xmath69 now , if we arrange the coordinates @xmath70 of @xmath28 in a @xmath71 matrix @xmath19 such that @xmath72 , we have @xmath73    several important remarks should be made at this point .",
    "first of all , consider @xmath16 and the density matrix @xmath74 obtained by replacing @xmath28 with @xmath75 : @xmath76 by the properties of the partial trace , we have that @xmath77 . but recall that the law of @xmath6 is unitarily invariant ; it is thus invariant by @xmath78 ( which is an element of @xmath79 ) .",
    "hence the law @xmath63 is invariant by unitary conjugation .",
    "being positive , and thus self - adjoint , density matrices diagonalize : @xmath80 with @xmath81 an unitary and @xmath82 a diagonal matrix with positive entries .",
    "the unitary invariance of @xmath63 corresponds to the fact that @xmath81 is distributed along the haar measure on @xmath25 .",
    "remains , of course , the question of the distribution of @xmath82 , the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues , which will be answered in section [ sec : spectrum ] ( see proposition [ prop : eig_rho ] ) .",
    "another important question concerns the law of the matrix @xmath19 .",
    "recall that the coordinates of @xmath19 are those of @xmath28 , rearranged in a @xmath71 matrix .",
    "since the pure state @xmath6 is distributed along the uniform measure @xmath65 , we know , by the second point of proposition [ prop : gaussian ] , that we can take for @xmath28 a complex gaussian vector in @xmath83 .",
    "thus , the elements of @xmath19 are independent , complex gaussian random variables .",
    "[ lem : rdm_wishart ] let @xmath19 be a @xmath71 complex matrix such that the entries are independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . ) @xmath84 random variables .",
    "then , the matrix @xmath85 has distribution @xmath63 .",
    "this lemma motivates the study of matrices of type @xmath86 , which will be taken up in the next section .",
    "this section is devoted to introducing the wishart ensemble of random matrices . introduced in the 1930 s to study covariance matrices in statistics ,",
    "wishart matrices have found many applications , both theoretical ( random matrix theory ) and practical : principal component analysis , engineering , etc .",
    "let us start by recalling the definition of the wishart ensemble :    let @xmath19 be a @xmath71 complex matrix such that the entries are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath84 random variables .",
    "the @xmath87 matrix @xmath88 is called a _ wishart random matrix _ of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath50 .    in virtue of lemma [ lem : rdm_wishart ]",
    ", there is a strong connection between the distribution of wishart matrices and the random density matrices we study .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath89 is a wishart matrix , then @xmath90 has distribution @xmath63",
    ".    we shall give a list of results on wishart matrices that will be used later in the study of random density matrices .",
    "as the results are rather classical in random matrix theory , we will not supply proofs , but only references to the original papers .",
    "we start with a result on the eigenvalues of a wishart matrix .",
    "being of the form @xmath88 , wishart matrices are positive and thus they admit @xmath1 non - negative eigenvalues @xmath91 .",
