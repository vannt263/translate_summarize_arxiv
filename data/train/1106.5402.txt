    "banados , silk and west demonstrated an intriguing possibility of collisions of particles with arbitrarily large center of mass energy around extremal kerr black hole @xcite .",
    "the collisions were between two ingoing particles that start from rest at infinity and fall freely towards the black hole .",
    "the collision takes place at a location that is close to the event horizon .",
    "it turns out that in order for collision to be energetic the angular momentum of one of the particles must be finetuned to a specific value @xcite .",
    "this particle approaches the event horizon asymptotically .",
    "thus the proper time required for the collision is infinite .",
    "a similar process was also studied in the context of many other known examples of black holes by different authors . while analyzing the possible implications of the high energy collision process for the distant observers at infinity",
    "the escape fraction was subsequently calculated .",
    "escape fraction tells us the fraction of particles created in the high energy collisions that manage to escape to infinity .",
    "it turns out that since the collision takes place at a location close to the event horizon most of the particles produced are absorbed by the black hole .",
    "thus the escape fraction in the case of a black hole turns out to be vanishingly small @xcite .",
    "thus although ultrahigh energy collisions would take place around extremal kerr black holes , they would be inconsequential from the perspective of observational implications and in such a case the physics at high energies would remain unprobed .",
    "we studied earlier the process of high energy collisions in the context of kerr naked singularity @xcite .",
    "we showed that it would be possible to have ultrahigh energy particle collisions around kerr naked singularity provided the kerr spin parameter is larger than but arbitrarily close to unity .",
    "collisions take place at a location which is away from the singularity .",
    "the collision is between ingoing and outgoing particles .",
    "outgoing particles naturally arise as initially ingoing particles are reflected back due to the potential barrier offered by the angular momentum of the particle in the equatorial plane and due to the repulsive nature of gravity along the axis of symmetry .",
    "we also studied the similar process in the context of reissner - nordstrm naked singularity when charge parameter transcends the mass parameter by infinitesimal amount @xcite . in this case , exploiting the spherical symmetry we could replace the particles by thin spherical shells and take into account the effect of self - gravity of colliding particles on the center of mass energy of collisions .",
    "we showed that in a reasonable astrophysical scenario the upper bound on the center of mass energy of collision between two proton like particles was much larger than the planck scale . whereas a similar calculation in the context of black holes showed the upper bound on center of mass energy of collision to be much smaller then the planck energy .",
    "we also showed that neither black holes nor naked singularities are necessary for high energy collisions to occur .",
    "we demonstrated this point in the context of the bardeen spacetime .",
    "it turns out that ultrahigh energy collisions can take place in the spacetimes that do not contain black hole @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address the issue of observability of high energy collisions in the absence of an event horizon .",
    "we specifically work in the context of kerr naked singular spacetime .",
    "we calculate the escape fraction for the particles produced in the high energy collisions around kerr naked singularity .",
    "following @xcite we make various assumptions .",
    "the collision considered is between two identical massive particles starting from rest at infinity .",
    "the collision , as stated before , is between ingoing and outgoing particle .",
    "we assume that the particles move on the equatorial plane .",
    "collision products are taken to be two massless particles . in the center of mass frame",
    "colliding particles move in in the opposite directions with same speed . in this frame",
    "two massless particles produced move in the opposite directions with equal magnitude of momenta .",
    "we assume that the two massless particles also travel in the equatorial plane .",
    "the distribution of the direction of motion of massless particles with respect to the direction of colliding particles is taken to isotropic .",
    "we focus attention on only one of the particles as we intend to compute the order of magnitude of escape fraction .",
    "we show that the escape fraction for the collision products to escape will be finite and would be approximately half .",
    "this implies that around half of the particles produced eventually hit the singularity and disappear while remaining half manage to escape away to infinity .",
    "thus significant fraction of collision products escape to infinity and would carry the information about nature of basic interactions at extremely large energy scales .",
    "this is in contrast with the black hole case where high energy collisions that take place in the vicinity of event horizon would be unobservable .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the kerr naked singularity geometry .",
    "we work in the units where the gravitational radius , speed of light and mass of the colliding particles is set to unity @xmath2 .",
    "the kerr metric when restricted to the equatorial plane , in boyer - lindquist coordinates is given by , @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 is the angular momentum parameter . when @xmath6 , event horizon is absent in the spacetime . however , there is a singularity located at @xmath7 , which turns out to be visible for the asymptotic observer .",
    "thus the kerr solution represents a naked singularity .",
    "we now analyze the geodesic motion in the spacetime .",
    "let @xmath8 be the velocity of the particle .",
    "we assume for simplicity that particle follows geodesic motion in the equatorial plane @xmath9 so that @xmath10 .",
    "the kerr spacetime admits killing vectors @xmath11 and there are corresponding conserved quantities @xmath12 , @xmath13 associated with the geodesic motion which are interpreted as the conserved energy and orbital angular momentum per unit mass . using these relations , @xmath14 can be written down and @xmath15 can be obtained using the normalization condition for velocity @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath17 for the massive particle and @xmath18 for the massless particle .",
    "the velocity components are given by , @xmath19 \\\\",
    "u^{\\phi}= \\frac{1}{\\delta } \\left[\\left(1-\\frac{2}{r}\\right)l + \\frac{2a}{r}e\\right ] , \\ ; u^{\\theta}=0 \\label{ur}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath20 where @xmath21 stands for radially outgoing and ingoing particles respectively .",
    "we shall deal with the colliding particles that start from rest at infinity . for such particles",
    "it turns out that @xmath22 .",
    "the variation of center of mass energy of collision between the ingoing and outgoing particles with angular momenta @xmath23 with radius around @xmath24 in a spacetime containing naked singularity with spin parameter close to unity , with @xmath25 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this section we briefly describe the process of ultrahigh energy particle collisions in the kerr naked singularity geometry with the spin parameter transcending unity by an extremely small amount @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we consider collision between ingoing and outgoing particles at @xmath24 .",
    "we assume that both the particles start from infinity at rest .",
    "thus the conserved energy per unit mass for each of the particles is @xmath22 .",
    "one of the initially ingoing particles must turn back as an outgoing particle at the radial location @xmath27 . the angular momentum per unit mass of this particle",
    "must lie in the range @xmath28",
    ". the lower limit on its value corresponds to the angular momentum it must have for it to turn back at all , whereas the upper limit comes from the restriction that it must turn back at the radial location @xmath27 .",
    "the second particle is an ingoing particle at the collision location .",
    "the requirement that it should not turn back before it reaches @xmath24 puts the following restriction on its angular momentum @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the center of mass energy of collision between the particles with velocities @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 approximate expression for the center of mass energy of collision in the situation that we described is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 are factors that can be written down in terms of the energy and angular momenta of the particles and they are of @xmath34 .",
    "clearly the center of mass energy of collision is large in the limit @xmath35 .",
    "the variation of center of mass energy in the vicinity of @xmath24 is shown in fig 1 for kerr geometry with @xmath36 .",
    "we now compute the escape fraction for the collision products .",
    "we assume that two identical massive particles each with mass @xmath37 participate in a collision and produce two massless particles . in the center of mass frame colliding particles travel in the opposite direction with equal magnitude of three - momenta .",
    "this is also the case with massless particles produced in the collision .",
    "the distribution of massless particles in the center of mass frame is assumed to be isotropic for simplicity and we focus only on one of the particles since we intend to calculate the order of magnitude of escape fraction .",
    "we assume that the massless particles travel in the equatorial plane .",
    "we first calculate the conditions under which massless particle will be able to escape to infinity .",
    "we then move over to the center of mass frame .",
    "the conditions for particles to escape can be translated to the escape cones in the center of mass frame within which particles must travel if it were to escape to infinity .",
    "sum of angles of these cones divided by @xmath38 will be the estimate of the escape fraction .",
    "we now derive the conditions for massless particles to escape to infinity .",
    "null geodesics are characterized by the ratio of conserved energy and angular momentum @xmath39 , rather than by both conserved energy and angular momentum as in the case of timelike geodesics .",
    "this can be seen from ( [ ur ] ) by dividing it throughout by @xmath40 and choosing a new affine parameter @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the old affine parameter .",
    "equivalently , one can choose @xmath22 .    the angular momentum required for the particle to turn back at the radial coordinate @xmath43",
    "can be obtained from ( [ ur ] ) and is given by @xmath44 two branches of @xmath45 namely @xmath46 are plotted in fig.2 .",
    "the lower branch of @xmath47 admits a maximum @xmath48 around @xmath49 for kerr spin parameter close to unity .",
    "the massless particle produced in a collision at @xmath43 could either be ingoing or outgoing corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "the particle will escape to infinity if @xmath50 the first condition in ( [ escape ] ) indicates that if the collision takes place at radial location @xmath43 and if the massless particle produced in the collision is to be radially ingoing then it would escape to infinity if its angular momentum lies in the range @xmath51 .",
    "this is evident from fig.2 .",
    "other four conditions can be interpreted similarly .",
    "these conditions can be translated into the escape fraction as we demonstrate below .",
    "the variation of angular momentum @xmath52 required for the massless particle to turn back from radius @xmath43 .",
    "the lower branch of @xmath47 admits a maximum @xmath53 around @xmath54 for kerr spin parameter @xmath55 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]      we now consider the procedure to move over to the center of mass frame .",
    "we first introduce locally non - rotating frame @xcite .",
    "given a vector in boyer - lindquist coordinate system @xmath56 , its components in the locally non - rotating frame @xmath57 are given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 in the above the @xmath60 being the kerr metric .",
    "we then make a rotation in the @xmath61 plane in the locally non - rotating frame so that the net three velocity of two colliding particles is oriented along the new radial direction .",
    "we further make a boost along new radial direction so that all the components of total three velocity now vanish .",
    "this is the center of mass frame .",
    "the transformation to center of mass frame from locally nonrotating frame can be given as @xmath62 where the transformation matrix is composed of rotation and boost @xmath63    the boost parameter @xmath64 and rotation parameter @xmath65 are given in terms of components of total velocity @xmath66 in the locally non - rotating frame as @xmath67    given the energy and angular momentum parameters of the colliding particles one can write down the velocity components in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system and also in the locally non - rotating orthogonal tetrad .",
    "the rotation and boost parameters can be written down once components of the colliding particles are known in the non - rotating frame .",
    "thus we can write down transformation laws that will allow us to write down components of any vector in the center of mass frame given its components in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system .",
    "[ fig:3 ]    [ fig:4 ]    we assume that the massless particles produced in the collisions travel in the equatorial plane and their distribution is isotropic in the center of mass energy frame .",
    "particles would escape to infinity if ( [ escape ] ) are satisfied .",
    "these conditions can be translated into the escape cones in the center of mass frame such that if the direction of motion ( in other words three - velocity ) lies in the cone , particle escapes to infinity .",
    "directions that define edges of the escape cones would correspond to the extreme angular momentum values in ( [ escape ] ) given the radial location of collision and whether particle is ingoing or outgoing .",
    "given the extreme momentum values one can write down the velocity components of the massless particle in the boyer - lindquist coordinate system . then one can make a transition to the center of mass frame and write down the three - velocities as @xmath68 angle between two extreme three - velocities will be the escape angle .",
    "when escape angle is divided by @xmath38 we get the escape fraction , @xmath69 here @xmath70 is the step function .",
    "the first term makes a contribution if collision takes place outside @xmath71 , whereas the second term contributes if collision takes place inside @xmath71 .",
    "since we are dealing with the case where @xmath72 in that case the high energy collisions will take place around @xmath24 .",
    "in this situation @xmath73 and the second term is relevant here but not the first one .",
    "there are two escape cones and thus there are two terms in @xmath74 .",

    "the spin parameter is slightly larger than unity @xmath77 .",
    "collision is between ingoing and outgoing particles with angular momenta @xmath78 .",
    "the escape fraction as a function of radial coordinate is plotted in fig 3a .",
    "escape fraction in this region around radial coordinate @xmath24 takes a value which is approximately half .",
    "variation of the escape fraction with the center of mass energy of collision is depicted in fig 3b .",
    "escape fraction increases slowly with the center of mass energy .",
    "this behavior is in contrast with the extremal kerr black hole case where there is a sharp decrement in the escape fraction with center of mass energy for the collision as we approach the horizon @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "thus the flux of the particles produced in the high energy collisions around the kerr naked singularity will be large as approximately half of the particles manage to escape to infinity while remaining half of the particles eventually hit the naked singularity .",
    "the high energy collisions , unlike the black hole case , would be observable and in principle would shed light on the nature of basic interactions at very large energies .",
    "collisions with large center of mass energy can take place around extremal kerr black hole .",
    "but since they occur at the location close to the event horizon , so most of the collision products formed are absorbed by the black hole . thus these collisions , although interesting from the theoretical perspective , are not observable at all .",
    "ultrahigh energy collisions can also take place around kerr naked singularity provided the spin parameter transcends the unity by extremely small amount .",
    "however , the collisions take place at a location away from the singularity .",
    "thus one might expect that the significant fraction of collision products would manage to escape to infinity . in this paper we calculated the escape fraction for the collision products in the kerr naked singularity case and confirmed that it is indeed a finite and large enough number , unlike the black hole case .",
    "the escape fraction for high energy collisions is approximately half in this case .",
    "this implies that half of the collision products manage to escape to infinity .",
    "thus high energy collisions around naked singularity are observable , in principle , and could help us understand the laws of basic interesting physics at ultrahigh energies .",
    "another important issue as far as the observability of the collisions is concerned is the time required for the collision to occur .",
    "we had shown earlier in the context of the reissner - nordstrm spacetime that the timescale associated with the planck scale collision in a reasonable astrophysical setting is significantly smaller than the hubble time in the naked singularity case , while that for black hole is many orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe @xcite .",
