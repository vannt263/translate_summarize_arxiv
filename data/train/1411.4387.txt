    "it is only important that the separation hypothesis , together with the assumption of ` real states of real systems ' implies local realism , although it potentially encompasses more .",
    "einstein goes on to consider entangled particles a and b , and to point out that depending on the choice of _ kind of measurement _ on a ( the type of observable , not its outcome ) we ascribe different state functions @xmath1 , @xmath2 to system b.    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ the real state of b thus can not depend upon the kind of measurement i carry out on a.

    "we will emphasize why the choice of different ( and incompatible ) measurements on a was a necessary part of his argument ( and amusingly he points out , contra - epr , that he ` does nt give a damn ' whether the states @xmath3 , @xmath2 are eigenfunctions of observables on b ! ) , but first let s note that this description of all the possible ensembles achievable in such experiments was subsequently carefully characterized by schrdinger who , within a year , proved the quantum steering theorem @xcite : +    given an entangled state @xmath4 of two systems @xmath5 , a measurement on system @xmath6 can collapse system @xmath7 to the ensemble of states @xmath8 with associated probabilities @xmath9 , if and only if @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the reduced state of system @xmath7 .",
    "the reason two ( incompatible ) measurements are necessary for einstein s argument for incompleteness is that if one considers only a single measurement on a it is trivially possible to maintain a one - to - one correspondence between a real state @xmath12 of system b and the quantum state : in this setting , the steering statistics for an entangled state on ab is indistinguishable from those of a mixture of quantum / real states @xmath13 for b , arranged such that the measurement on a needs only reveal only which member of the ensemble pertains . by choosing to steer to one of two different ensembles of quantum states @xmath14 , @xmath15 _ with at least some elements distinct",
    "_ this is no longer possible .",
    "einstein concluded that , assuming local realism , many different quantum states must be associated with any given real state of b. note , however , that since these different quantum states for b are operationally distinct , it clearly can not be the case that those different quantum states are all only ever associated with that one single real state of b. they must somehow differ in the ensemble of real states they correspond to .",
    "such a difference can be reflected either in terms of the members of the ensemble ( i.e. sometimes being associated with completely different real states ) or in terms of the frequencies ( probabilities ) over the ensemble , or both .    in the epr paper",
    "the initial state of ab used is maximally entangled , and the ensembles steered to are those of orthogonal quantum states ( position or momentum eigenstates ) . for this steering scenario",
    "it is well known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that the wigner function provides a local ( but as per einstein s argument , necessarily incomplete ) description of reality .",
    "we begin by showing that steering between two ensembles of orthogonal states for a qubit also can be explained within such a local realistic theory .",
    "let us formalize einstein s conclusion and its implications , simplifying to the easiest case possible : two different measurements on a that steer the quantum state of a qubit b to ensembles @xmath16 , @xmath17 where @xmath18 are all different , @xmath19 , and the members of each ensemble are equally likely . as schrdinger had proven , this is possible for any entangled state @xmath20 for which _ b=| x |+| x |=| y |+| y | . in a realistic description",
    ", every quantum state corresponds to a probability distribution over a set of real states @xmath12 .",
    "when an entangled quantum state is prepared on ab , let @xmath21 denote the ensemble of real states for b. it must be the case that @xmath21 can be resolved into the steering ensembles as [ nu ] ( ) = x()+x()=y()+y ( ) where @xmath22 , @xmath23 denotes the probability density over real states corresponding to the quantum state @xmath24 .",
    "einstein s argument then runs that while @xmath25 could potentially have disjoint support , thereby still allowing for the possibility each @xmath12 is associated with a unique quantum state , the incompleteness of quantum theory is assured by the fact that at a given @xmath12 for which ( say ) @xmath26 is non - zero , one or other of @xmath27 must be non - zero .",
    "now , einstein ( explicitly ) and schrdinger ( at least for the sake of argument ) assumed that a complete description of reality is possible , and that in such a theory the quantum state would therefore be incomplete in the precise sense einstein defined @xcite .",
    "even for the simple case of steering between 2 ensembles captured by the generic decomposition of equation this yields some extra consistency conditions which need to be satisfied .",
    "for example it must be possible to find a probability density @xmath21 over some space of real states that can be decomposed into probability densities @xmath25 which are disjoint , because @xmath28 and @xmath29 are orthogonal . denoting by @xmath30 the support of the probability density @xmath22 we have that s_=s_xs_x = s_y s_y .    in the original epr argument the scenario considered involves steering of b between the ensembles of position and momentum , and then analysis of the conclusions that can be drawn if a subsequent position / momentum measurement is performed on b. similarly here we analyse the restrictions that the incomplete description of reality must obey if measurements of the projectors onto the ensemble - i.e. @xmath31 or @xmath32 are performed .",
    "such consideration shows that we must also obey consistency conditions of the form [ int ] _",
    "s_xdy()=|x|y|^2 , to conform with the probability of obtaining the outcome @xmath33 if a measurement in the basis @xmath34 is performed on b after the quantum state has been steered to @xmath35 .",
    "it is useful to identify 4 disjoint regions of the space of real states : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 and to use the notation [ notation ] _",
    "j_s_jd ( ) , j=1,  ,4 .",
    "since @xmath40 and @xmath41 , from equations of the form ( [ int ] ) we must have : @xmath42 with all other values 0 or 1 .    by integrating ( [ nu ] ) over the appropriate regions we identify a final set of consistency conditions : [ 12 ] _",
    "j = x_j+x_j = y_j+y_j , j=1,  ,4",
    ". these are satisfied by taking @xmath43 , while @xmath44 .    so far then , all of these essentially trivial consistency conditions - which any local incomplete description of reality must obey - are easily complied with .    in section [ 3steer ]",
    "we will show that if we add the possibility of an extra measurement on a being used to steer to a third ensemble of orthogonal states we find a contradiction , indicating any realistic theory explaining quantum theory must be nonlocal - bell s theorem .",
    "however , we now turn to a proof that yields the same conclusion , but uses steering between only two ensembles , one of which contains a pair of non - orthogonal states .",

    "( b ) the space of real states , with disjoint regions of support labelled 1, .. ,6 such that @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    ", title=\"fig:\",width=240 ]    to show that incompleteness can not save local realism we now consider the possibility of steering a qubit between two ensembles , where one of the ensembles contains non - orthogonal states .",
    "most probably einstein , but certainly schrdinger , knew that this was possible - it is consistent with einstein s calculation summarized in footnote @xcite and is mentioned explicitly in schrdinger s proof of the steering theorem ( he limits only to ensembles wherein the states are linearly independent ) .",
    "consider then steering the state @xmath49 depicted in fig .",
    "1(a ) either to its eigen - ensemble @xmath50 or to the ensemble @xmath51 that is an equal mixture of non - orthogonal states @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . in the incomplete theory",
    "these quantum states correspond to preparation of real physical states according to probability distributions @xmath22 ,",
    "@xmath55 which have support on sets labelled @xmath30 .",
    "local realism implies @xmath56 ; moreover because @xmath57 and @xmath58 are orthogonal , @xmath59 while @xmath60 and @xmath61 can overlap .",
    "this is depicted in fig .",
    "1(b ) where a convenient labelling for various regions of support is shown .",
    "once again using the notation in equation we have some simple consistency conditions , for example normalization imposes [ normx ] x_4+x_5+x_6=1 .",
    "consider the case the system has been steered to the quantum state @xmath29 and we wish to compute the probability of obtaining a measurement outcome @xmath62 or alternatively of @xmath63 . a quick glance at fig .",
    "1 leads naturally to the constraints @xmath64 and for @xmath65 these are readily seen as incompatible with eq .",
    "( [ normx ] ) .",
    "for example summing these two equations and inserting the normalization constraint implies @xmath66 , implying @xmath67 .",
    "as @xmath68 is the integral of a probability density it must be positive , in the face of this it is clear that the assumption of local realism , upon which the whole discussion is premised , must be false - this is bell s theorem .",
    "the steering - based proof of bell s theorem we have just presented has actually made a subtle assumption .",
    "let us reconsider the case wherein the system has been steered to the quantum state @xmath29 and we wish to compute the probability of obtaining a measurement outcome @xmath62 . above",
    "we assumed this imposes @xmath69 .",
    "however , while it is certainly the case that all real states @xmath12 in @xmath60 must deterministically yield the outcome @xmath62 , any real states in @xmath61 can potentially also yield this outcome , because @xmath70 and @xmath71 are not orthogonal . within regions 3 and 6",
    "they need not even do so deterministically , because @xmath72 .",
    "that is , the incomplete realistic theory may have a property defined in @xcite as _ deficiency_. in fact , for the case of three and higher dimensional quantum systems , it follows @xcite from the kochen - specker theorem that any realistic theory ( local or otherwise ) _ must _ be deficient , that is , it must be the case that the set of real states that a system , prepared in quantum state @xmath73 , may actually be in , is necessarily strictly smaller than the set of real states which would reveal the measurement outcome @xmath62 with some finite probability .    to see that allowing the local realistic theory to be deficient does not save it from bell s theorem",
    "we formally capture the possibility of deficiency by defining a _ response function _ or _ indicator function _",
    "@xmath74 , which for every @xmath12 is simply the probability that particular real state yields the @xmath62 outcome . since @xmath75 we must have 0_s_6d_a()x()_s_6dx()=x_6 , and so we obtain generalizations of eq .",
    "@xmath76    once again equations , can not be simultaneously satisfied .",
    "for example , substituting into gives x_6&= & x_6^(a)+^22 + x_4&= & x_4^(b)+^22 and so x_4+x_62 ^ 22>1 , ( 0,/2 ) , which violates normalisation .",
    "we now return to the steering of section [ 2steer ] , and show that steering between 3 ensembles of orthogonal states can sometimes violate the consistency conditions",
    ". for simplicity presume for the moment that the third ensemble of orthogonal states @xmath77 is such that the state @xmath78 , i.e. @xmath79 ` bisects ' the states @xmath80",
    ". then @xmath81 the last term being the quantum mechanical born - rule prediction . for the same regions of support @xmath82 defined in section [ 2steer ] we now deduce consistency conditions z_1+z_2=z_1+z_3=z_3+z_4=z_2+z_4&= & + z_3+z_4=z_2+z_4=z_1+z_2=z_1+z_3&=&1-clearly @xmath83 and @xmath84 . we must also have _",
    "j = z_j+z_j j=1,  ,4 .",
    "there is no way to satisfy all these equations , subject to the requirement @xmath85 .",
    "for example , an independent set of the above equations is z_1+z_2=z_2+z_4&=&[aa ] + z_2+z_4=z_1+z_2&=&1-[bb ] + z_1+z_1&=&[cc ] from these we obtain @xmath86 which , using @xmath87 , gives @xmath88 .",
    "this is manifestly negative for any @xmath89 .",
    "once again , the failure to keep the incomplete realistic models consistent indicates the initial assumption of local realism is unviable .",
    "it is interesting to note that if the states @xmath90 had been chosen to be the eigenstates of the pauli operators @xmath91 then @xmath92 and the consistency conditions _ would _ be satisfiable .",
    "contrast this with the fact that the inconsistency obtained when @xmath93 bisects @xmath80 holds regardless of how close these latter two ( distinct ) states are .",
    "as such we see that `` how far apart '' the triples of states are does not capture the difficulty or otherwise of reproducing their steering properties in an incomplete model of physical reality .    to investigate this further",
    "we have analyzed the possible triples of overlaps |x|y|^2 , |x|z|^2 , |y|z|^2 which do or do not allow for a proof of the untenability of local realism by violating ( or otherwise ) the consistency conditions above .",
    "a mix of analytical and numerical evidence makes us confident that the answer takes the particularly pleasing form given by    the triple of overlaps @xmath94 demonstrate a violation of local realism if and only if the point @xmath95 $ ] does not lie in the convex hull of the four points @xmath96 $ ] , @xmath97 $ ] , @xmath98 $ ] , @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "we have also performed some preliminary forays into the question of how steering between four ensembles may differ .",
    "one thing we noticed in this regard is that if we look at steering performed on a werner state ( mixture of maximally entangled and maximally mixed state ) then the lowest probability of the maximally entangled state for which violation of local realism can still be demonstrated is 4/5 when steering between 3 ensembles and @xmath100 when steering between 4 ensembles .",
    "in deriving bell s theorem from steering , a number of observations crop up that merit further investigation .",
    "one intriguing feature is that we never make use of the assumption @xmath101 , rather positivity was required only for integrals of the distributions over certain regions within the space of real states .",
    "thus the proof rules out certain options for quasi - representations of the quantum state as well .",
    "a second observation concerns the deficiency property introduced in section [ 2steernon ] .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that measurement - outcome contextuality @xcite manifests itself in incomplete models of reality via _",
    "deficiency_. this in turn makes it strictly impossible for such a model to obey conditions of the form in equation - i.e. all the non - orthogonality of quantum states can not be attributed to classical non - orthogonality of their associated probability distributions .",
    "perhaps combining this observation with steering of entangled systems of dimension three or higher can yield different steering - type proofs that local realism is untenable .",
    "finally , the proof in section [ 2steernon ] did not require an equation of the form ( ) = p x()+ ( 1-p ) x()=a()+b ( ) to hold .",
    "not only did the probabilities with which elements of the ensemble appear play no role , the proof would have still gone through even if p x()+ ( 1-p ) x()a()+b ( ) , as long as the supports of the distributions satisfied @xmath102 .",
    "thus only a weaker assumption than _ preparation non - contextuality _ as defined by spekkens @xcite is needed .",
    "it may be interesting therefore to consider further a weaker version of preparation contextuality , one defined solely in terms of the equivalence , or otherwise , of the supports of distributions which convexly combine to the same mixed state , and not an exact equivalence of the convexly combined probability densities themselves .",
    "in this regard we should mention that barrett has shown @xcite that standard bipartite proofs of bell s theorem can be converted into a proof of preparation contextuality .",
    "before concluding let us mention some relevant work .",
    "the proof in section [ 2steernon ] is readily extended to show nonlocality for all non - maximally entangled pure states , reproducing the conclusions of gisin , popescu and rohrlich @xcite .",
    "although our proofs are algebraic and thus reminiscent of ghz @xcite and hardy @xcite type arguments against local realism , the proof in section [ 3steer ] would seem closest to mermin s exposition of bell inequalities in @xcite .",
    "harrigan and spekkens @xcite perform a more careful and thorough exposition of einstein s argument above for incompleteness and the relationship to locality . in @xcite , werner presents an alternative route which could have led einstein to bell s argument .",
    "finally , one may wonder whether the quantum state can still be argued to be incomplete in einstein s sense above even when separability is given up . while it is in fact possible to obey all consistency conditions generalizing those above for such an incomplete realistic theory @xcite , it turns out that an assumption of separability for _ product _ quantum states leads to the exact opposite conclusion , namely that the quantum state must be complete @xcite .    in conclusion , if einstein and schrdinger had probed only a little further into whether an incomplete description of physical reality can actually fully explain the gedankenexperiment that they had used to rule out completeness of quantum theory , perhaps the tension between locality , realism and quantum theory would have been brought to the fore significantly earlier .",
