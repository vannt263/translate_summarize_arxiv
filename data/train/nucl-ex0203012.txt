    "the concept of a fluid - walled ultracold neutron ( ucn ) storage bottle is due to c. bates @xcite who developed and demonstrated the technique at the risley reactor in the u.k .",
    "the basic idea is that a hydrogen - free fluorinated oil ( fomblin ) wets glass and metal surfaces , and thereby produces a clean , chemically perfect , microscopically flat and reproducible ucn reflecting surface .",
    "fomblin is quite viscous at room temperature ; when it is sprayed onto surfaces , it drains away leaving a thin stable film .",
    "the fluid readily seals gaps and holes associated with ucn entrance and exit valves , provided that the mechanical parts fit rather closely .",
    "fomblin also has a very low vapor pressure .",
    "some of the most accurate determinations of the neutron @xmath0decay lifetime have been obtained with fomblin - walled storage cells .",
    "@xcite    there is some uncertainty in the chemical formula of fomblin y vac 18/8 ( manufactured by ausimont / montedison group ) , the material most widely used in ucn storage experiments .",
    "the mean molecular weight is 2650 , and the stoichiometry is roughly @xmath1 , with density at 20@xmath2 c of 1.89 g / cc , with a mean effective ucn potential of @xmath3 nev . the ucn loss coefficient ( @xcite , eq . ( 2.66 ) )",
    "is given by the ratio of the imaginary @xmath4 to real part @xmath5 of the effective ucn potential , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the total @xmath8 loss cross section for neutrons with wavenumber @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the coherent scattering length .",
    "@xmath11 has contributions from nuclear absorption and bulk process , e.g. upscattering which occurs for temperature @xmath12 . for the range of formulae for fomblin given in @xcite , the possible values of @xmath11 due to nuclear absorption lie in the range",
    "@xmath13 the uncertainty in the fomblin molecular formula given in @xcite is a result of the coherent scattering lengths of c , f , and o being quite similar ( 6.65 , 5.60 , 5.81 fm , respectively ) so the effective ucn potential @xmath5 is relatively insensitive to the relative numbers of each atomic species . on the other hand , the nuclear absorption cross sections of c ,",
    "f , and o are quite different ( 3.5 , 9.6@xmath14.5 , 0.19 mb , respectively , for thermal ( 2200 m / s ) neutrons ) .",
    "thus , the stoichiometry of fomblin could be better determined by simultaneously considering @xmath11 extrapolated to @xmath15 , which is quite sensitive to the atomic fraction of f because it has a comparatively larger absorption cross section , and @xmath5 which can not be used to effectively determine the relative amounts of f and o.    for experiments operated near room temperature ( 290 k - 320 k ) , it is found that @xmath16 and the temperature dependence of @xmath11 is much faster than being proportional to @xmath17 or @xmath18 as might be expected due to atomic and molecular fluctuations in the wall ( see , e.g. , @xcite , sec .",
    "2.4.6 ) , and if fact seems to follow the viscosity temperature dependence rather closely .",
    "some attempts were made to explain the observed temperature dependence of @xmath11 .",
    "for example , if there is a @xmath8 cross section for slow neutrons due to upscattering in the fluid , this cross section can be used to modify @xmath4 to include this loss mechanism and in this regard , the transmission of 60 neutrons through a sample of fomblin as a function of sample temperature was measured @xcite .",
    "these measurements are discussed in @xcite where it is stated that the temperature dependence of @xmath11 comes within a factor of 1.5 of explaining the experimentally observed temperature dependence of the loss rate .",
    "the loss rate for the lowest temperature 218 k @xcite implies @xmath19 which is still an order of magnitude greater than eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) .",
    "more recent measurements by by morozov et al . of the transmission of 9 m",
    "/ s neutrons through a 4 mm thick sample as a function of temperature are consistent with these results @xcite .",
    "it is possible that @xmath20 has contributions from different sources .",
    "the purpose of our work reported here is to evaluate the upscattering loss of ucn due to thermally excited surface capillary waves .",
    "pokotilovski has investigated the energy broadening of ( monochromatic ) ucn stored in a fluid walled bottle @xcite ; this is a question closely related to the upscattering loss , but it seems to us that the temperature dependent loss rate is an experimentally better studied phenomenon but is lacking a fundamental explanation .",
    "the principal data we will address were obtained by richardson et al .",
    "although the properties of this material are available from the manufacturer , we thought it prudent to perform measurements ourselves under conditions similar to those used in an experiment .",
    "the sample of fomblin y vac 18/8 ( hereafter referred to as fomblin ) was obtained from that used in @xcite .",
    "these is anecdotal evidence that the viscosity changes for degassed samples in vacuum compared to samples that have been stored a long time in air .",
    "we therefore performed our measurements with the fomblin under vacuum when possible , with the material being introduced into the various apparatuses to be discussed by distillation under high vacuum ( @xmath21 torr ) .",
    "these measurements were done in aug .",
    "1991 ; some details were lost ( e.g. , specific equipment models employed ) but given the modest accuracy of the results , these details are not important .",
    "the viscosity was determined by the time it took for a known volume of fomblin to drain through a pyrex capillary of known length and diameter , under the influence of gravity .",
    "the glass system comprising two relatively large volumes connected by a capillary is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "marks were placed on the large tubes corresponding to a volume @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the capillary diameter was @xmath24 mm , with length 4.8@xmath25 cm .",
    "fomblin was distilled into the glass measurement apparatus under high vacuum ; the glass was sealed off from the vacuum system , and the time to drain the known volume was measured as a function of temperature , with the temperature determined by a water bath .",
    "the kinematic viscosity is given by ( @xcite , eq .",
    "( 17.10 ) ) @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath28 the acceleration of gravity , @xmath5 is the known volume , @xmath29 is the time to drain the known volume , and @xmath30 is the capillary radius .",
    "the time to drain the volume varied from about 150 sec at the lowest temperatures , to about 2 sec at the highest temperatures ; at the lowest temperatures , the constancy and value of the temperature was the major uncertainty ( @xmath31 k ) , while at the high temperatures , the timing ( to 0.1 sec accuracy ) was the principal limitation to the accuracy .",
    "in addition , there is a small correction associated with the change in height of the liquid layer as the fomblin drains , but it is less than 5% . the results are shown in fig . 2 and are in good agreement with , and follow the trends of , values reported by the manufacturer ( 1.9 , .09 , and .02 @xmath32/s at 293 , 393 , 493 k respectively ) . in the range of measurements , the viscosity is adequately described to within experimental error by the following empirical formula : @xmath33 where @xmath27 is in @xmath32/s , and @xmath17 is measured in k , with estimated accuracy over the temperature range 280 - 308 k which will be used later .",
    "fomblin was distilled into a pyrex capillary tube of 2 mm inside diameter , filling the tube to a length of about 5 cm .",
    "the tube was sealed off from the vacuum system , and the relative change in length of the sample as a function of temperature was measured .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "3 ; the principal limits to accuracy were the length measurement ( @xmath34 mm ) and temperature control ( @xmath35 k ) .",
    "the thermal expansion of fomblin is about 100 times larger than pyrex , so the expansion of the glass is an insignificant correction .",
    "the density as a function of temperature is given by @xmath36\\   { \\rm g / cm^3}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is measured in k , and the accuracy of this fit is about 5% .",
    "the temperature dependence of the density is particularly important because it leads directly to a temperature dependence of the effective ucn potential .",
    "this information was not available from the manufacturer .",
    "the surface tension was measured using a cenco student demonstration tensiometer which in essence measures the restoring force against a length of wire pulled up against the liquid surface .",
    "unfortunately , there was no simple way to perform this measurement on a sample under vacuum .",
    "the apparatus was calibrated with deionized water .",
    "for fomblin , the surface tension was found to be @xmath37 and was independent of temperature to within measurement accuracy .",
    "the value quoted by the manufacturer is 20 dyne / cm .      by use of a heterodyne laser scattering technique",
    ", the dynamic liquid surface properties of fomblin could be measured directly without physically contacting the surface in any significant way .",
    "the idea is that the surface undergoes a sort of brownian motion due to thermal fluctuations .",
    "the theory describing the two - dimensional thermally excited surface capillary waves has been developed by bouchiat and meunier ; when presented as a time and two - dimensional surface fourier transforms , the mean - square height fluctuations are described by @xcite @xmath38\\ ] ] where @xmath39 @xmath40 where , as before , @xmath41 is the surface tension , @xmath42 is the density , and @xmath43 is the viscosity @xmath44 where @xmath27 is the kinematic viscosity",

    ", the time - dependent scattered component can be measured by beating with the reference beam .",
    "the reference beam is produced by placing a weak transmission diffraction grating in the specularly reflected beam ( this grating also intercepts the scattered light which is extremely weak ) .",
    "this technique was proposed and developed by hrd et al .",
    "@xcite the specific apparatus that we used is described in @xcite , with the exception of the vacuum sample cell .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , data was aquired with the apparatus on a vibration isolated optical table . in addition , the vacuum sample cell isolated the liquid surface from disturbing air currents which were a problem for free liquid surfaces in air .",
    "the fomblin sample was contained under vacuum in a cubical cell ; the cell was constructed of 5 mm thick float glass plates , and had internal dimension of 4 @xmath23 , glued together with torr - seal epoxy ( varian ) .",
    "a 5 mm diameter pyrex tube was glued into a hole drilled in the top plate ; fomblin was distilled into the cell ( to a depth of 3 mm ) through this tube and then sealed off from the vacuum system .",
    "the cube was cooled / heated from the bottom with a peltier device , and the temperature was controlled with a simple feedback loop .",
    "light was directed onto the liquid surface at an angle of approximately 70@xmath2 from normal through one of the vertical walls of the cell ; the scattered and specularly reflected light exited the opposite vertical wall .",
    "the laser light was detected with a pin photodiode , and the heterodyne signal was fourier analyzed with a hewlett - packard audio frequency spectrum analyzer .",

    "@xmath66 so @xmath67 so we expect no significant effect due to film thickness",
    ". however , at higher temperatures where the viscosity is low , the films might drain to layers thin enough so that there is a substantial correction .",
    "the net effect will be to reduce the upscatter rate .",
    "we are also considering rather high frequency waves ; it might be expected that the fomblin has some frequency dependence .",
    "however , fomblin appears to be a newtonian fluid ( e.g. , light scattering and mechanical measurements had no anomalous behavior ) and the fomblin molecules are not very large on the scale of what is considered a polymer .",
    "the molecular collisional frequency of fomblin molecules , which is on of the factor that determine the viscosity , is much higher than the frequencies of interest for ucn scattering ( e.g. , @xmath68 hz compared to more than @xmath69 hz ) . for the analysis presented here , we will assume that the low frequency measurements described earlier in this paper are applicable .",
    "let us consider an incident neutron with wavevector ( we set the azimuthal angle of the incoming wave to zero without loss of generality ) ; referring to fig . 5 , @xmath70 where",
    "the polar angle @xmath71 is defined relative to the surface normal which is taken along @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is the incident ucn energy .",
    "the surface wave disturbance can be described by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the azimuthal angle relative to the incident neutron momentum .    when a ucn diffracts from the time varying surface , energy and momentum are conserved ( we consider first upscattering , e.g. , the ucn gains energy ) .",
    "@xmath76    we can consider a ucn of specified @xmath77 , hence @xmath78 is specified , and choose @xmath46 which determines @xmath79 ; choosing @xmath80 determines @xmath81 and @xmath82 , the polar angles of the outgoing neutron wavevector .",

    "the probability of loss per bounce was calculated by pokotilovski @xcite : @xmath90 where @xmath91 with @xmath92 the critical momentum for ucn reflection .",

    "the results , taking into account the temperature dependence of the viscosity and density ( hence effective ucn potential ) of fomblin are shown in fig .",
    "6 .    the slow curvature with increasing temperature ( hence decreasing viscosity ) results from the @xmath48 term in eq .",
    "( [ bm ] ) , which is proportional to the surface tension , becoming important .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that a simple fit to a value of @xmath11 and to losses through holes and gaps of total area @xmath109 does not explain the observed lifetimes of a fluid - walled bottle for energies within 10 nev of @xmath5 .",
    "there is enough flexibility in @xmath11 and @xmath109 to adequately fit the lower values of energy ; as seen in fig .",
    "6 , the surface wave upscatter loss probability drops rapidly with energy",
    ". however , the temperature variation in @xmath11 as derived from these fits seems non - physical .    in general ,",
    "a full monte - carlo analysis of the system is required .",

    "another fortunate feature of the ref .",
    "@xcite measurements is that the cylindrical storage cell height @xmath110 cm leads to a small change in ucn energy as a function of position in the cell ( 7% effect ) that can be modelled , as described below , with 10% accuracy .    for our reanalysis of the ref .",

    "we fitted the observed lifetime vs. energy data to @xmath11 and @xmath109 was done as in @xcite , but included all data points and the surface wave upscatter loss described by eq .",
    "( [ loss ] ) .",
    "however , particularly for @xmath73 close to @xmath5 , we need to take into account the effects of gravity in the storage bottle which was a horizontal cylinder with radius @xmath111 cm and length @xmath112 ) .",
    "there are two effects that need to be accounted for .",
    "first , the upscatter loss function energy dependence is very steep for @xmath73 approching @xmath5 .",
    "second , a ucn that upscatters at the `` top '' of the storage vessel will gain energy as it falls , and will eventually be lost from the system if the final energy @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "this effect can be modelled by varying @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ loss ] ) as a function of height in the bottle .",
    "the total average lifetime for a ucn with initial energy @xmath114 ( monochromatic ) specified at a horizontal plane that intersects and divides the storage vessel into two halves at the cylinder axis can be readily determined .",

    "the most extensive data presented in @xcite is for the temperature @xmath128 k. including the surface wave upscattering loss and fitting to the two parameters results in an excellent fit , as shown in fig .",
    "the decrease in @xmath129 ( see table ii ) compared with the fit results presented in @xcite shows the importance of the surface wave loss for ucn energies near the wall potential .",
    "it should be noted that the excess loss is not associated with slow heating of the ucn , as suggested in @xcite but with a direct upscattering loss . as will be shown in the next section , the heating / cooling effect",
    "probably does not alter the functional form shown in fig .",
    "fits to the 283 k and 308 k data are shown in figs .",
    "8 and 9 , with fit results tabulated in table ii .",
    "again , including the surface wave upscattering loss provides an explanation of the extra loss rate for the higher energy ucn .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath129 for these fits is extremely sensitive to the energy , e.g. , changing the energy for either of the two highest points in fig . 7 by @xmath130 nev changes @xmath129 by a factor of 0.5 to 2 .",
    "therefore , the fact that the spectrum shape can be varying during storage might be evident in the data and analysis , but as can be seen by directly considering figs .",
    "7 - 9 , the simple analysis presented here is adequate to within statistics , implying an accuracy of 10 - 20% .",
    "including the uncertainties in the measured fomblin properties would lead to a modest reduction in @xmath129 .",
    "finally , the values of @xmath11 for the various temperatures shown in table ii indicate a significant temperature dependence .",
    "these values , along with the value derived from @xcite discussed in the introduction are plotted in fig . 10 .",
    "it can be seen that a crude extrapolation to @xmath15 implies a reasonable range of values for the residual ( nuclear absorption ) loss .",

    "the surface wave loss amounts to 20% of the net total loss for 70 nev ucn at @xmath128 k. in @xcite , it is stated that the observed upscatter loss in the transmission of 60neutrons comes within a factor of 1.5 of explaining the observed loss . within the approximations here",
    ", it would seem that the surface wave scattering can account for most of the excess loss observed in this storage experiment .",
    "heating of ucn occurs when energy is gained as before , but when the final energy is still lower than the wall potential .",
    "the calculation is carried out by integrating from near @xmath135 to @xmath108 as defined in relation to eq .",

    "the lower limit is set by the resolution of the measurement apparatus , or , e.g. , by the spectral width of the stored nearly monochromatic ucn , taken here as @xmath136 nev , so @xmath137 nev and @xmath138 .",

    "were stored in a fomblin - coated bottle , and upscattering to energies between 52 and 106 nev were detected . to calculate this probability , we assume an initial ucn energies in the 0 - 52 nev range , and calculate the total probabilities to scatter to the 52 - 106 nev range , using eq .",

    "the energy - dependent upscatter probabilities are then averaged over the initial spectrum presented in @xcite , fig .",
    "as presented in table iii , it can be seen that our results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental results , to within the reported factor of 2 to 3 uncertainty associated with neutron transport efficiency in the experimental apparatus . a plot of the upscatter probability as a function of temperature , for the parameters of this experiment , is shown in fig .",

    "the functions are very symmetric about the incident ucn energy , so the effect of a small energy change , either an increase or a decrease , tend to be averaged away .    the measurements by bondarenko et al .",
    "@xcite also determined the probability for ucn with initial energy around 13 nev , to downscatter to final energy in the range 0 - 11.5 nev , and found a probability of about @xmath145 per bounce .",
    "the temperature of the fomblin was not specified ; however , the measured probability is consistent with the results presented in fig .",
    "13 where the integrated probability to downscatter from 10 nev initial energy to less than 8.5 nev is in the @xmath145 range for both temperature curves shown in fig . 13 .",
    "( the variation in integrated probability with initial energy is fairly slow ; the calculated result would not be significantly different for 13 nev initial energy . )",
    "the rapid drop in probablity with decreasing maximum final energy that is evident in fig .",
    "13 is consistent , within statisitics and uncertainties in neutron transport , with the data presented in @xcite , fig .",
    "as shown in figs . 7 - 9 , the ucn lifetime for energies near 100 nev ( e.g. , the high energy data points presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ) are well - described by upscattering loss due to surface waves . in this analysis ,",
    "the low - frequency kinematic viscosity and surface tension were used .",
    "the excellent agreement between theory and experiment suggest that no modification of the low frequency dispersion curve for the surface waves are required , but we might anticipate that for higher accuracy data , this simple analysis ultimately might not be sufficient",
    ".    it was suggested in @xcite that the excess high energy loss is due to changes in the stored ucn spectral properties ; the analysis presented here indicates that direct upscattering to energies higher than the wall potential fully account for the observed loss rate beyond that due to nuclear absorption and upscattering in the film ( as parameterized by @xmath11 in eq . ( [ mu ] ) ) and losses through holes and gaps .",
    "the decrease in @xmath129 for the re - analysis of the richardson et al .",

    "11 and 12 , the heating and cooling probabilities are sufficiently small so that , at the level of accuracy of the data presented in @xcite , the effects of spectral evolution are not important",
    ". however , such effect are likely important for high - accuracy determination of the neutron lifetime from fomblin coated bottles .",
    "we have shown that the observed temperature dependence of the net loss rate has a significant component due to the surface wave upscattering loss process . in @xcite , the measured temperature dependence of the lifetime for 70 nev in a fomblin coated bottle",
    "is given as 4 s / k .",
    "this was not fully explained by the temperature dependent @xmath8 cross section ( e.g. , the temperature dependence of @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) ) .",
    "the temperature dependent loss implied by measurements of transmission of 60neutrons through fomblin was 33% too small @xcite .",
    "however , from our analysis , the surface wave upscattering accounts for up to 20% of the loss for 70 nev ucn .",
    "this accounts for much of the reported discrepancy .",
    "this , together with our estimate of the temperature variation of @xmath11 , explains the ucn loss in fomblin coated bottles to within experimental errors .    recent fomblin transmission measurements using 9 m / s neutrons by morozov et al .",
    "@xcite indicate that @xmath146/k which is in rough agreement with the result presented in sec .",

    "unfortuantely , our value of @xmath11 extrapolated to @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "10 ) has too much uncertainty to help with the analysis of the fomblin stoichiometry as discussed in the introduction .",
    "we hope that the analysis presented here will stimulate high - accuracy experimental measurement of the temperature dependent @xmath8 cross section of fomblin .",
    "it is our expectation that the temperature dependence of @xmath11 together with the surface wave loss rate can fully explain the temperature dependence of the storage lifetime of fomblin coated bottles ."
