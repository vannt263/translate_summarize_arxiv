    "the paucity of millimetre - wave band absorption can therefore be attributed to the traditional optical selection of targets biasing towards absorbers of low dust content and therefore low molecular fractions .",
    "the fact that intervening absorbers are usually found through optical spectroscopy , yielding a redshift but also giving the above bias against dusty objects , means that millimetre - band searches of known intervening absorbers have generally been unsuccessful ( @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "[ all - mags ]    in order to investigate whether this could affect our sample , we use the photometry of the searched sources ( table [ all - mags ] ) to derive the uv luminosities ( as per @xcite ) .",
    "showing these in fig .",
    "[ lum ] ,        we see the expected increase in luminosity with redshift and note that our selection of the reddest phfs sources ( sect.[ts ] ) means that nearly all of our targets lie below @xmath48  ( left panel ) . since we are unlikely to detect molecular absorption in an environment not conducive to large columns of cool neutral gas , in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ lum ] we show the uv luminosity versus the _ colour depth _",
    ", which we define as the optical  near - infrared colour normalised by the depth of the search . as expected from the column density@xmath49 correlation ( fig . [ norm - colour ] ) , this gives a vertical line with this quantity plotted as the abscissa for both @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the intervening absorbers are not shown in the plot as , although the ultra - violet luminosities can also be estimated , these are remote from the source . ] and from this definition we see that 20 discrete sources ( mostly from this work ) have been searched sufficiently deeply , of which only 12 are located in the bottom right quadrant defined by @xmath52  and a _ colour depth _ @xmath53 .    as expected , in fig .",
    "[ lum ] ( right ) there is an anti - correlation between the uv luminosity and @xmath49 colour , since the former is derived from the observed frame optical photometry . as such",
    ", there is also the possibility that the calculated values of @xmath54 are influenced by the dust extinction towards the source .",
    "however , the fact that 21-cm absorption is never detected above a critical luminosity ( or below a critical magnitude / dust extinction ) , as well as the correlation between the 21-cm absorption strength and @xmath49 colour @xcite , indicates that the extinction occurs within the host in the case of the 21-cm detections , which follow the expected 50% detection rate for @xmath55  @xcite .",
    "therefore , whether due to high intrinsic uv luminosities or a paucity of dust within the host galaxy , it remains that 21-cm absorption is not detected where @xmath56  and where we do not detect 21-cm we do not expect to detect absorption by molecular gas .",
    "lastly , as well as a covering factor of @xmath57 , as per the four known systems , we have assumed an excitation temperature of @xmath58 k ( at @xmath5 ) [ sect .",
    "[ mwcf ] ] . since there is no apparent correlation between the optical  near - infrared colour and the excitation temperature for the four known systems ( table [ columns])135 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 k , similar to the excitation temperature of 1830@xmath61211 with @xmath62 . ] , we can not estimate temperatures for any of the searched sample .",
    "if the gas were at higher excitation temperatures , being mostly observations of the lower rotational transitions ( table [ sum ] ) , the limits are less sensitive than quoted since a larger total column density would be required to give the same observed flux in these transitions .",
    "this has the effect of worsening the limits to the point where only two of the searched sources are ( just ) potentially detectable when @xmath63  k ( fig . [ 3-lum ] ) , although if the gas is diffuse , such excitation temperatures may not be attainable , even in the presence of high kinetic temperatures .",
    "we have undertaken a survey for molecular absorption in the millimetre - band at high redshift .",
    "like all previous surveys ( since @xcite ) , we have not detected millimetre - band spectral line absorption in any of the targets . in the case of absorption due to intervening sources , it has been established that the paucity of detections is due to the traditional optical selection of these objects , in which the redshift of the intervening object is usually known , biasing against the reddest , and thus dustiest , absorption complexes ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have therefore aimed to circumvent this bias , by searching for molecular absorption within the hosts of particularly red objects , although like @xcite , who also targetted red sources ( and type-2 agn ) , we find no absorption .",
    "a possible reason for some of the non - detections is that only 12 of the 40 objects searched are known to be located in the bottom right quadrant of the ultra - violet luminosity_colour depth _ plot ( fig .",
    "[ lum ] , right ) , i.e. where @xmath64  and @xmath65/\\log_{10}n_{\\rm co } \\approx [ 0.77\\,(v - k ) + 12.5]/\\log_{10}(1000 \\times n_{\\rm hco+})\\gapp1 $ ] .",
    "this suggests that only a dozen of the sources may be subject to an ultra - violet flux which permits the presence of cool neutral gas @xcite , while being `` sufficiently red '' to indicate the presence of a large column of dust along the sight - line to the quasar @xcite .",
    "given that :    * for these , the reddening could be occuring anywhere along the line - of - sight , and not necessarily in the host galaxy , as is the case for three of the five known oh absorbers ( four of which make up all the known redshifted millimetre - band absorbers ) .",
    "the only reason we chose to observe the emission redshift is that it gives a frequency to which to tune the receiver ",
    "@xcite previously attempted millimetre - wave spectral scans towards very dim objects , but the redshift range scanned is a trade - off with the time spent on each frequency , resulting in poor optical depth limits over what were limited redshift ranges in only a few sources .",
    "* this fifth absorber , which was detected in oh but not hco@xmath0 , may be the result of lower millimetre - wave covering factors in comparison to those at decimetre wavelengths @xcite .",
    "this may be analogous to the effect seen in the optically selected dlas ( sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] ) , where , due to the steeper cosmological evolution in the heavy element abundance in the -bearing dlas , @xcite suggest that these constitute a more homogeneous class of objects than the general population dla @xcite .",
    "that is ,  absorption may only be observed in a limited subset of possible sight - lines and @xcite suggest that a distinction could arise from the much smaller cross - section of the molecular gas , located in small and dense regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , in comparison to that of the atomic gas .",
    "this means that only a narrow sight - line will occult the quasar , although the dla may be apparent through the more widespread 21-cm absorption . *",
    "as well as covering factor effects , if the excitation temperature of the putative absorbing gas is higher than the assumed @xmath4 k ( at @xmath5 ) , the column density limits are poorer than those calculated here .",
    "if large enough ( @xmath6 k ) , none of these searches , mostly of the lower rotational transitions , have been sensitive enough to detect co or hco@xmath0 absorption in these sources , although the absorbing medium may be too diffuse to reach such temperatures through collisional excitation .",
    "@xcite accounted for their non - detections by suggesting that the extinction may be occuring outwith the host galaxy or that the x - ray flux from the agn may be photo - dissociating the molecules .",
    "these possibilities are similar to the points made above , although by quantifying these via the findings of @xcite , we find that not all of the targets of @xcite are sufficiently faint and reddened to have been detected , no matter the location of the obscuring material .",
    "therefore , the key to finding new redshifted molecular absorbers in the millimetre - band is through the selection of the faintest optical objects ( giving @xmath64 ) and performing spectral scans towards these to _ colour depth _ limits of @xmath53 , as defined by the column densities and colours of the four known absorbers . in order to also circumvent the covering factor effect",
    ", pilot searches for oh in the decimetre band could be undertaken , with the low rest frequency ( 1667 mhz ) allowing a full spectral scan in only four separate tunings with the square kilometre array @xcite .",
