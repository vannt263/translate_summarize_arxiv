    "a promising approach to avoid clumping is to coat the powder by nanoparticles .",
    "the small particles act as spacers between the grains , reducing the mutual van - der - waals forces and thereby increasing the flowability of the powder . however , the fabrication of coated powders is a technically challenging task since the nanoparticles themselves have an even stronger tendency to clump , forming large aggregates before they are deposited on the surface of the grain .",

    "the remaining particles are distributed around the charges , partly decaying with distance , partly as a constant background .",

    "now we address the other limit , namely two spherical particles of the same size .",
    "the rotational degree of freedom must be taken into account when the two particles are of equal size .",

    "when the system consists of two particles , each carrying one charge ( of opposite sign ) , that are located at a specified point on the surface , then the coulomb force gives a contribution to the rotation as well as to the translation of the particles .",

    "this means that it is the relative strength of coulomb force and brownian motion that decide whether the two charges find each other upon the collision , or whether a permanent dipole pertains .",
    "the natural scale for coulomb energy is the energy of the two charges two particle radii apart @xmath78 .",
    "rotational brownian motion is controlled by thermal energy , and if @xmath79 the orientation of the particles is completely random when they collide .",
    "the average distance of the resulting dipole can in this case , by a simple numerical integration over the surfaces of the disks or the spheres , be calculated .",
    "the numerical values are : @xmath80 ( 2d ) and @xmath81 ( 3d ) , i.e. , slightly more than two particle radii .",
    "in the other limit of vanishing brownian motion the average distance is of course zero .",
    "further , a crossover in the average distance of the dipole is expected roughly at @xmath82 . in colloidal sciences ,",
    "the crossover between regions dominated by coulomb interaction on the one hand and by thermal diffusion of particles on the other hand is often determined by the bjerrum length @xmath83 on distances smaller than the bjerrum length , interaction of particles is guided by coulomb interaction , while on larger distances diffusion dominates .",
    "if all colloidal particles carry identical charges , the suspension is stabilized by coulomb repulsion if the particle radii are smaller than the bjerrum length .",
    "the values of the limits and the location of the cross - over are verified by numerical experiments as shown in fig .",
    "experiments are performed for differently sized particles and for different charges in 2d .",
    "the data sets collapse since only the ratio of the coulomb energy and the thermal energy is relevant .",
    "this universal curve shows a cross - over , seperating a regime where the residual dipole moment increases lineary with thermal energy , from a regime where it approaches the maximal value .",
    "this allows one to estimate the typical dipole length , in experiments as well as in simulations .",
    "in reality , particles are not perfectly circular or spherical .",
    "the roughness of the surface of a particle has the qualitative implication that rotations become increasingly difficult with increasing roughness . as a consequence ,",
    "we expect a shift of the cross - over to lower thermal energies . in this sense , the oberserved point can be considered as an upper limit for the range where the coulomb forces dominate .",
    "the use of electrostatic forces strongly affects the dynamics of agglomeration processes , for instance coating of micrometer particles with nanometer particles .",
    "in particular , it is still an open question to what extent the exact locations of charges on the particles have impact on the resulting agglomerated structures . in this context",
    "the subquestion arises whether recombination of two particles carrying opposite charge gives a pertaining dipole or whether the charges cancel out . to simulate large systems of",
    "suspended charged particles , knowledge about charge recombination allows for proper approximations , which in turn may increase the range of many - particle simulations .    a detailed study of two idealized situations have been presented . first the case of one very large particle with a target charge , which attracts a much smaller particle with one oppsite charge . formulating the problem in terms of a fokker - planck equation , the stationary solution is found analytically in 2d and 3d .",
    "the findings are supported by numerical simulations , and the key results are as follows .",
    "interpreted as a hitting probability distribution , there is a finite fraction of charged particles that exactly recombine with the target charge , giving rise to a @xmath67-peak in the distribution .",
    "this is valid in 2d as well as in 3d , although the strength of the @xmath67-peak is somewhat larger in 2d .",
    "however , in 3d there is an additional contribution decaying like @xmath84 , where @xmath38 is the distance from the target charge .",
    "this is the main difference between 2d and 3d , and it is the reason why superposition of the solution is possible in 2d , but not in 3d .",
    "further , there is a constant background term in the probability distribution whose physical reason lies in the diffusion of the particles .",
    "numerics is performed to test the analytic results , and to provide qualitative insight into the situation of having more target charges in 3d , which from the point of view of applications is very important . in this case",
    "the superposition of a homogenous background plus a @xmath85 shoulder located around each fixed charge fits the numerical data suprisingly well .",
    "deviations from the superposition of single charge solutions are visible in an increasing strength of delta peaks .",
    "thus , an increased number of fixed charges increases the probability for a compensation of fixed charges and incoming particles .",
    "the second idealized situation is the study of two particles of equal size recombining . in this case",
    "the rotational degree of freedom is included . from physical reasoning and from simulation",
    ", we demonstrate that there is a cross - over when coulomb energy equal to thermal energy .",
    "larger thermal energies means a regime where dipoles are created with random distance . for lower thermal energies the average length of the dipole goes to zero in the limit , but for finite ratios of the energies , the average length increases rapidly with the energy ratio",
    "this implies that for simulations or experiments in this range , the detailed localization of charges on the particles must be taken into account for a correct description of the physics .",
