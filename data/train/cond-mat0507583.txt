    "during the last decade a number of proposals for constructing an artificial quantum two - level system by making use of mesoscopic josephson junctions were implemented  @xcite . since it was recognized that these circuits might serve as quantum bits ( qubits ) for quantum information devices the field",
    "has attracted increased attention .",
    "basically , two kinds of such devices have been developed , based on the charge or flux degree of freedom . here",
    "we will consider one realization only , which is based on the charge degree of freedom . in this quantum system two charge states differing by @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the electron charge )",
    "are mixed by josephson tunneling .",
    "one example of such a device is the single - cooper - pair transistor - two mesoscopic tunnel junctions separated by a small superconducting island on which the charge can be induced by an external gate voltage @xcite .",
    "the relative energy of the states is controlled by the gate voltage .",
    "since the measurement of a quantum system is a very delicate procedure , the readout sensor is a crucial component of any potential quantum computing circuit . in order to minimize the exchange of energy between detector and qubit",
    "the control of the reactive component of the output signals has been proposed and implemented  @xcite . such kinds of measurements requires the proper design of the qubit .",
    "for instance a charge qubit can be a conventional single - cooper - pair transistor closed by a superconducting loop  @xcite . for a certain range of the relationship between effective josephson coupling and charge energies @xmath2 of the transistor s junctions , this device is effectively a two - level quantum system with externally controlled parameters  @xcite .",
    "moreover , similar to both the traditional nonhysteretic rf squid  @xcite and the dc squid  @xcite , the phase - biased transistor coupled to a high - quality radio - frequency tank circuit  @xcite turns out to be an ideal parametric converter of charge and flux signals with standard quantum limit of the energy resolution .",
    "recently measurements of the energy level separation of a superconducting charge qubit were reported .",
    "the qubit was coupled to a high quality tank circuit  @xcite or non - resonantly to a single mode of the electromagnetic field of a superconducting on - chip resonator  @xcite .",
    "multiphoton transitions between energy levels in superconducting devices were studied in several articles @xcite ; in this work we present both the experimental observation and the theoretical description of the multiphoton transitions between the ground and the first excited state in the phase - biased charge qubit tinkham , fr , zor1 , krec1 making use of the impedance measurement technique @xcite .",

    "we calculate the population of the upper level of this effective two - level system .",

    "the relevant energy values are the island s coulomb energy , @xmath12 , where @xmath13  is the total capacitance of the island , and the effective josephson energy @xmath14 an important feature of the qubit is that its josephson energy can be controlled by the external magnetic flux @xmath15 piercing the ring . in this paper , the ring inductance @xmath16",

    "the experimentally measurable value is the phase shift between the voltage and current in the tank circuit @xmath64 .",
    "the expression for the phase shift at the resonant frequency @xmath65 is ( see e.g. in ref .",
    "[ 26]):@xmath66here @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and we have neglected the ring s inductance @xmath16 in the denominator .",

    "both the junctions and the island are imbedded in a macroscopic ( 0.5@xmath901mm@xmath91 ) superconducting gradiometer - type - loop , which was done in order to minimize vibration and magnetic noise .",
    "the single - cooper - pair transistor and the loop were fabricated by e - beam lithography and shadow evaporation of aluminum .",

    "the tank voltage was sequentially amplified by means of a cryogenic rf preamplifier , a room temperature amplifier , and further relevant standard electronics .",
    "the measurements were carried out in a dilution - type refrigerator at a nominal temperature of about 10 mk . in order to minimize the noise level inherent in the total gate voltage , we equipped the transistor s gate line ( a thermocoax between 2 k and 10 mk ) with conventional low - pass rc and microwave copper powder filters ( fig .",

    ", three microwave filters were mounted on different low - temperature plates ( 2 k , 50 mk , and 10 mk ) of the refrigerator .",

    "a high - attenuation thermocoax line along with two ( on the 2 k and 10 mk ) cooled commercial 20 db - attenuators were used for applying a microwave power ( uhf gate ) to the sample .",
    "this microwave line is coupled inductively to the pb - shield resonance cavity with the qubit inside . at the microwave frequency the current fed into the pb shield",
    "is amplified by the quality factor of the resonator , producing an electromagnetic field . in our measurements",
    "special care was taken to avoid the magnetic coupling between the microwave line and the qubit : ( i ) the qubit sample was placed across a pb resonator for maximum electric ( e)-field interaction and ( ii ) the gradiometer - type topology of the qubit circuit prevents the sample from the interaction via mutual inductance with the microwave line . as a further evidence for e - coupling via the length of the al thin film charge - gate electrode ,",
    "only the noise - like output signal on microwave power was obtained with sample after mechanical break of this thin film gate line .    by passing a dc bias current through the tank coil ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) we could simply control the flux - induced currents circulating in the qubit ring , because of the mutual inductance between qubit and tank . for the tank , we prepared square - shaped nb pancake coils on oxidized si substrates tor . for flexibility ,",
    "only the coil was made lithographically .",
    "we use an external capacitance @xmath98 to be able to change the resonance frequency of the tank which , in this particular case was 28.9 mhz .",
    "the tank circuit was coupled by a 30 cm long piece of two - wire line to the cold hemt - amplifier .",
    "changes of the phase of the tank voltage oscillations due to variations of the josephson inductance of the sample were measured by means of an averaging procedure : every measurement point was taken ( with a time constant of 0.1 ms ) 50 times and averaged .",
    "cryogenic @xmath99-metal and superconducting shields protected the sample against external magnetic and electric noises .",
    "however , we could not take any special action to avoid the drift of electrostatic carriers within the substrate , so the 1/f noise due to background charge motion is not completely negligible in our experiments .",
    "the dependence of the phase shift @xmath64 on the gate voltage is shown in figs .",
