    "ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattices have been increasingly used to simulate the rich physics in strongly correlated condensed matter systems . in particular , the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state @xcite in a magnetized superconductor , in which spin imbalance of electrons leads to cooper pair formation and condensate in states with nonzero momentum ( inhomogeneous distribution in real space ) , was proposed four decades ago .",
    "however , the observation of the fflo state in solids has been proven to be extremely difficult due to the meissner effect , and was only achieved recently in a heavy fermion system @xcite .",
    "experimentally , two hyperfine states of ultracold fermionic atoms play the roles of up and down spins .",
    "their population could be controlled by using radio - frequency field , such that the hope of observing the fflo state in cold atomic systems has been renewed recently @xcite .",
    "since the dimensionality of the cold atomic systems can be easily tuned , and indeed cold atoms have already been successfully trapped in one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide , it seems natural to consider these nonhomogeneous pairing behaviors in this low dimensional systems .",
    "so far , much attention has been paid to 1d spin - polarized fermionic systems with attractive interaction by using different methods and techniques , such as bethe - ansatz @xcite , density - matrix renormalization - group @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , and bosonization @xcite .",
    "all of these studies are based on approximating the system by the 1d hubbard model in either uniformly distributed or harmonic trap cases respectively . in uniformly distributed case , the dominant order in the ground state is singlet superconducting ( ss ) ggbatrouni , and existence of fflo state @xcite , which is oscillating in real space and peak in momentum space ( non - zero momentum of cooper pairs ) . as",
    "polarization increasing gradually , phase separation will happen gradually in the harmonic trap , like fflo & fully paired wings , fflo & polarized wings and chandrasekhar - clogston limit @xcite .    recently , taglieber _ et al _ @xcite have successfully trapped a quantum degenerate fermi - fermi mixture , i.e. @xmath1li and @xmath2 , by evaporating cooled bosonic @xmath3 gas .",
    "the advance raises a new and interesting question .",
    "what is the influence of mass difference to the spin polarized fermionic system or does it become easier to observe the fflo state in such a system . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of mass difference has been discussed with @xmath4 .",
    "they found that there is a phase transition between ss and charge density wave ( cdw ) in the negative @xmath0 case , and phase separation exists in the positive @xmath5 case .",
    "the bosonization study @xcite showed that the phase boundary between the density - wave phase and phase separation scales like @xmath6 in the weak coupling region .",
    "the results are consistent with previous numerical studies @xcite by the exact diagonalization and density - matrix renormalization group technique .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the role of both ",
    "spin\"(species ) and mass imbalance in a mixture of two species of fermionic atoms with attractive interaction in optical lattices .",
    "we use the 1d asymmetric hubbard model ( ahm ) as an effective model to describe such a mixture in the optical lattice , and then study the phase separation , dominant order and pairing behavior in the context of different spin populations and negative @xmath0 region using the bosonization approach .",
    "we find that if the system is partially polarized , there can exist two different phase - separated states , and the fflo state might be more stable in the presence of mass imbalance .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : res ] , we obtain the bosonized form of the 1d asymmetric hubbard model , then simplify it under conditions of away from half filling @xmath7 and @xmath8 . in section [ sec : ps ] , we study the ground - state phase diagram , and the effects of spin imbalance , and mass imbalance . in section",
    "[ sec : do ] , we discuss dominant order and pairing behavior in our interested system .",

    "we use spin \" @xmath15 to denote the type of atoms . for sufficiently low temperatures ,",

    "we would like to point out that the two phase separated states , i.e. i and ii , are qualitatively different . for the configuration",
    "i , the pair - pair correlation function @xmath87 has a non - vanishing long - range behavior .",

    "as we known , the ground state is ss in standard hubbard model with negative @xmath5 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is phase transition from ss to cdw driven by different mass in negative @xmath0 case but with @xmath88 .",
    "and now we want to find the modification of spin and mass imbalance to the pattern in ground state . for this purpose",

    "they are defined as @xcite @xmath89where @xmath90for cdw , sdw , and ss , respectively . in 1d fermi liquid",

    "@xcite , there is no phase transition from ss to cdw now .",
    "we believe that the system will come into phase separation region before this transition happens .    at the same time",
    ", we can obtain oscillating behavior of pairs very easily . in our system",
    ", pair correlation mainly comes from singlet pair correlation because of on - site attractive interaction .",
    "therefore , ss correlation function is just expected now .",
    "it is obvious that pair correlation function will take the following form : @xmath94 } \\frac{1}{%    @xmath95 , the pair correlation will take the oscillation form , and different mass will modify the correlation exponent @xmath96 together with spin imbalance . this state has non - homogeneous distribution in real space , and it is called fflo state . from fig .

    "fig : exponents ] , we can see that the exponent @xmath96 is suppressed , hence the fflo state becomes favorable , as the mass difference increases .",
    "therefore , we believe that the mass imbalance is good for the fflo state .",
    "in this paper , from the bosonized form of the 1d asymmetric hubbard model , we have studied the role of spin imbalance and mass imbalance at zero temperature under various conditions .",
    "the conditions of phase separation have been presented , and the effects of spin imbalance , different mass and interaction are also discussed in detail .",
    "we find that more - light - particle case is same as the more - heavy - particle one at the weak coupling limit . and they are different in the strong coupling limit . in the liquid phase , ss is always dominant and there is no phase transition from ss to cdw .",
