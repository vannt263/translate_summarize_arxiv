    "recent observational data indicate that the curvature of the universe is small , without ruling out the negatively curved case .",
    "on the other hand , the eq are insensitive to the global nontrivial topology , induced by a discrete group of isometries @xmath3 acting freely and properly discontinuously in the covering space .",
    "this group acts according to a type of generalization of poincar s theorem - the tessellations of @xmath2 by hyperbolic polyhedra @xcite .",

    "the results apply only to compactifications of flat space .",
    "there are arguments , however , which allow for a compact hyperbolic manifold as the space section @xcite .",
    "the effect of the topology induces the formation of circles in the sky , which , in principle could be measured in the cmbr @xcite .    a very attractive argument in favor of compact hyperbolic manifolds is connected with pre - inflationary homogenization through chaotic mixing , as was discussed by cornish et al .",
    "they suggested that inflation occurred near the planck era , after the chaotic homogenization , so that the two processes together are better suited to explain the large scale structure of the universe observed today .",
    "the motivation for this work is based on this argument .    due to the particular interest in the small volume hyperbolic universe",
    ", we make a numerical calculation of the vacuum expectation value of the energy of a conformally coupled massive scalar field ( e.g. , inflaton ) in a static space - time @xmath5 , where the spatial section is the compact hyperbolic 3-manifold of the smallest volume known , @xmath6 , called the weeks manifold @xcite , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the radius of curvature of the universe . the quantum field theoretical effects were strongest in the era under consideration by cornish et al .",

    "we calculate a generalization of their result for a particular multiply connected hyperbolic space section .",
    "we use the point splitting technique which is very useful in determining the ultraviolet behavior in curved space , since it involves the evaluation of field quantities infinitesimally displaced .",
    "the obtained propagator is exact and possesses information about the global properties of the manifold in the sense that the infrared modes are taken into account , for lie groups , as well as some homogeneous space - times , such as the static @xmath9 and @xmath10 @xcite . when the space - time is multiply connected , the propagator is obtained as the usual sum over paths : all the nontrivial geodesics connecting the two points are taken into account , which is the technique used in @xcite , and the one used in this work .",
    "we find a static hyperbolic solution for the eq , whose spatial section is the weeks manifold in section ii . in section iii ,",
    "we write the expression for the vacuum expectation value of the energy momentum tensor .",

    "our conclusions are presented in section v. ( we use natural units , @xmath11 , except in section ii . )",
    "it is well known that hyperbolic geometry can be obtained via `` minkowski '' space , together with an additional constraint @xmath12 it can be easily seen that the isometry group is the proper , orthocronous lorentz group , also called @xmath13 which is isomorphic to @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this space is homogeneous in the sense that every point in it can be reached from any other by the action of an element of the isometry group . using the constraint in the line element of eq .",
