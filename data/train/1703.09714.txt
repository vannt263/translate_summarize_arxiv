    "white dwarfs are the final stage of the evolution of stars with main sequence masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite , a range which includes the vast majority of all stars .",
    "white dwarfs are therefore key tracers of the evolutionary history of the galaxy ( e.g.@xcite ) and significant contributors to the global stellar population .",
    "however , to fully exploit the diagnostic potential of the galactic white dwarf population , it is necessary to reliably constrain fundamental parameters such as their space density @xcite , mass distribution @xcite and luminosity function @xcite .",
    "these studies require large , homogeneous , and well - defined samples which , given the intrinsic low luminosity of white dwarfs , are still challenging to be assembled .",
    "large samples of white dwarfs are also the starting point in searches for rare sub - types like magnetic white dwarfs @xcite , pulsating white dwarfs ( @xcite , see sect.[pulse ] ) , high / low mass white dwarfs @xcite , white dwarfs with unresolved low mass companions @xcite , white dwarfs with rare atmospheric composition @xcite , close white dwarf binaries @xcite , metal polluted white dwarfs @xcite or white dwarfs with dusty or gaseous planetary debris discs @xcite .    in recent years the number of known white dwarfs has increased by an order of magnitude , in particular thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) which led to the identification of over 26000 white dwarfs mainly in the northern hemisphere @xcite .",
    "the southern hemisphere ( below dec @xmath5 ) has not yet been surveyed by deep multi - colour ccd photometric surveys , and consequently only @xmath6 percent of all known white dwarfs are south of the celestial equator ( cf fig.[north_vs_south ] ) . however , the potential for identifying large numbers of white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere is now rapidly growing thanks to the public surveys carried out by the european southern observatory ( eso ) with the vlt survey telescope ( vst ; * ? ? ?",

    "the survey is carried out at the 2.6 m vst , located at cerro paranal in chile .",
    "the telescope mounts at the prime focus a 1sq - deg wide imaging instrument , the omegacam @xcite , which consists of 32 ccds of @xmath25 pixels each .",
    "the narrow gaps between the individual ccds allow for an overall geometric filling factor of 91.4 per cent ( see * ? ? ? * for more details ) .",
    "the atlas band - passes are similar to those of the sdss filters .",
    "observations are taken in pairs for each filter and exposure times of 60s for @xmath26 , 50s for @xmath27 and 45s for @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the imaging data is reduced by the cambridge astronomical survey unit ( casu ) using the vst data flow software .",
    "images are trimmed and debiased using nightly calibration frames and then flat - fielded using accumulated monthly stacked twilight sky flats .",
    "the frames are then corrected for cross - talk and defringed if necessary .",
    "the resulting imaging data comprise the combination of the two individual images for each of the original ccds @xcite . for the analysis presented here , we used the latest internal data release available on 2016 april 25 .",
    "this release includes coverage in all five filters and photometric quality flags for @xmath30sq - deg of the sky , surpassing the publicly available data release 3 .",
    "vst atlas uses the same optical filters as sdss ( @xmath15 ) and in many ways aims to be the southern hemisphere counterpart of sdss . however , though the filter systems are nominally the same , the actual filter transmission curves have small differences , the detectors are not the same , the observing conditions at the telescope sites are different , and the flux calibration is conducted in different ways . as a result atlas and sdss magnitudes , and therefore colours , are not perfectly equivalent . as part of their recalibration of atlas photometry to the ab system @xcite carried out a detailed comparison of sdss and atlas photometry .",
    "atlas and sdss overlap over an equatorial region of @xmath31 deg@xmath32 covering parts of both the north galactic cap ( @xmath33 ra @xmath34 15@xmath3530@xmath36 ; @xmath37 dec @xmath38 ) and the south galactic cap ( 22@xmath3540@xmath39 @xmath34 ra @xmath34 3@xmath35 ; @xmath40 dec @xmath41 ) . @xcite used the objects in the northern galactic cap overlapping region to develop a set of colour dependent equations to convert atlas ( ab ) magnitude in equivalent sdss magnitudes : @xmath42 since our selection method for white dwarf candidates makes use of a probability map in reduced proper motion - colour space that was initially developed from sdss data ( see sect.[atlas_cand ] ) , it is of paramount importance to have reliable sdss - equivalent atlas magnitudes ( atlas@xmath43 from here on ) . in order to evaluate the robustness of the magnitude transformations developed by @xcite , in particular their applicability to blue objects",
    ", we carried out some further comparison with sdss .",
    "we retrieved the available sdss photometry of all atlas sources in the overlapping regions with clean @xmath44 sdss photometry ( @xmath45 objects ) .",
    "we then applied equations[colour - convert ] to the atlas photometry and compared the atlas@xmath43 magnitudes with the sdss ones ( fig.[mag_comp_atlas ] ) .",
    "we find that the mean values of sdss @xmath46 atlas@xmath43 magnitudes for the objects in our overlapping samples are : @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "these mean differences are smaller than the typical uncertainties in the sdss and atlas magnitude .",
    "we therefore conclude that atlas@xmath43 magnitudes are , for most intents and purposes , equivalent to sdss ones and our selection method for white dwarf candidates @xcite can be directly applied to them .",
    "comparison of atlas@xmath43 and sdss magnitudes for a sample of @xmath45 point sources .",
    "the dashed black lines indicate a 1:1 relationship .",
    "the comparison objects were chosen as sdss objects with clean photometry . ]",
    "using the free form sql query tool available on the omegacam science archive webpage we retrieved photometry for all atlas sources which have been observed in all five filters , marked as  stellar \" or  probable stellar \" and with no  important \" quality issue ( table[sql - cut ] ) .",
    "we then applied the magnitude conversions described by equations[colour - convert ] to calculate atlas@xmath43 magnitudes for all our sources .",
    "the first step in our photometric selection method for white dwarf candidates involves applying a set of colour constraints which broadly select all blue sources ( table[col - cut ] ) .",
    "these colour - cuts are designed to include all white dwarfs with @xmath52 and are required to reduce the initial sample to a more manageable size , but they are not sufficient to eliminate contamination from qso and other blue objects ( i.e. subdwarfs , a stars ; for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "this initial broad colour selection resulted in a sample of @xmath10blue atlas sources .",
    "atlas does not provide proper - motion measurements thus we decided to retrieve those from the recently published absolute proper motions outside the plane ( apop , @xcite ) catalogue .",
    "apop proper motions are calculated from carefully re - reduced photographic plates from the stsci catalog of objects and measured parameters from all - sky surveys ( compass ) archive of the gsc - ii project @xcite .",
    "apop covers 22525 square degrees and provides proper motions for 100774153 objects to the limiting magnitude of r @xmath53 with typical uncertainties ranging between 4 and 9mas / yr . however the astrometry of apop and atlas correspond to observations taken several years apart and most white dwarfs have high proper motions , typically ranging from 20 mas / yr to 200 mas / yr .",
    "white dwarfs can therefore move significantly over a few years to decades and a simple cross match between atlas and apop using a fixed matching radius can easily lead to several mis - matches or missing objects .    [",

    "we presented the application of our selection method for photometric white dwarfs candidates @xcite to the latest internal data release of the vst atlas survey combined with proper motions from apop .",
    "the resulting catalogue contains @xmath7atlas sources with computed @xmath54 . using a small number of sdss spectroscopically confirmed white dwarfs and contaminants we calculated that a confidence cut at @xmath55 produces a sample of white dwarfs that is 96 per cent complete with an efficiency of 87 per cent .",
    "we estimate that our catalogue contains @xmath1 high - confidence white dwarf candidates the majority of which have not yet received spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "only @xmath23 per cent of the white dwarfs known to date are located in the southern hemisphere and our catalogue therefore constitute a significant improvement on the current north - south knowledge gap .    among these thousands of new white dwarfs we expect to find several systems of particular interest : metal polluted white dwarfs ( most likely more than 1000 in the final atlas footprint ) which will improve current statistics on planetary debris abundances , a few tens of white dwarfs with detectable debris discs which can be identified combining our catalogue with ir data from the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs , @xcite ) and wise @xcite , several magnetic white dwarfs and white dwarfs with rare atmospheric composition ( e.g. dq ) like those already identified in our limited spectroscopic follow - up ( sect.[spec_follow ] ) , and more pulsating white dwarfs ( sect.[pulse ] ) .",
    "the application of our catalogue to most white dwarfs population studies will ultimately require spectroscopic follow - up .",
