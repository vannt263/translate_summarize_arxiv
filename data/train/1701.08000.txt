    "* system . * the system we consider in this study is depicted in fig.1 .",
    "two whispering - gallery - mode ( wgm ) microresonators having the same resonance frequency @xmath16 and the loss rate @xmath2 are coupled to each other with a coupling strength of @xmath9 which can be tuned by varying the distance between the resonators .",
    "one of the resonators supports a mechanical mode with effective mass @xmath17 , frequency @xmath4 and damping rate @xmath12 .",
    "we consider resonators made of silica , silicon , or silicon nitride , where intrinsic tlss exist .",
    "also , the resonator supporting the mechanical mode has a defect that is coupled to the local phonon mode via mechanical strain , with the coupling strength @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the tunable energy difference between the excited and ground states of the defect - induced tls @xcite , @xmath20 denotes the potential of mechanical deformation , @xmath21 is the young s modulus of the material , and @xmath22 is the mechanical mode volume @xcite .    in the rotating frame at the pump frequency @xmath3",
    ", the hamiltonian of this system , which is composed of two optical modes , one mechanical mode and one tls , can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 or @xmath7 denote the annihilation operators of the optical modes or the mechanical mode , @xmath24 is the mechanical displacement operator , @xmath25 denotes the frequency detuning between the pump laser and the cavity resonance , @xmath26 is the com coupling strength , @xmath8 is the resonator radius , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the pauli operators of the tls ( see fig.1 ) given by @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "the field amplitude of the pump light is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the power of the pump .",
    "defining the supermode operators for the optical fields as @xmath36 and applying the rotating - wave approximation , we obtain the effective interaction hamiltonian of the system : @xmath37 the first term in this expression describes the phonon - mediated transition between optical supermodes , and the second term describes the coupling between the phonon and tls defect .",
    "thus , in the supermode picture , the optomechanical coupling is transformed into an effective coupling describing defect - assisted phonon lasing .",
    "the tls can be excited by absorbing a phonon generated from the transition between the upper optical supermode and the lower one , so that the behaviour of the phonon lasing is strongly modified .     and",

    "as described in the methods and the supplement , the mechanical gain of this system is given by @xmath49 , \\nonumber\\\\ g_d=&-\\frac{g_d^2\\gamma_q}{\\gamma^2_q+(\\omega_q-\\omega_m)^2 + 2g_d^2n_b},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the defect tls decay rate , and @xmath50 is the population inversion operator , and @xmath51 with the phonon number @xmath52 ( see the supplementary materials ) .",
    "if there is no defect , i.e. @xmath53 , we have @xmath54 , as was already obtained in ref.@xcite .",
    "the second term of @xmath15 , describing the optical detuning effect , can be made positive or negative by tuning the optical tunneling rate @xmath9 ( i.e. , coupling strength of the resonators ) by changing the distance between the resonators .",
    "note that this term is positive when @xmath55 , negative when @xmath56 , and zero when @xmath57 or @xmath58 . in the latter case",
    ", @xmath15 is described with only the first term , i.e. @xmath59 , as given in ref.@xcite .",
    "the inevitable effect of material defects on the phonon lasing , as described by @xmath60 , has not been studied before .    with the mechanical gain at hand",
    ", we can derive the threshold pump power @xmath61 from the threshold condition @xmath62 ( see the supplementary materials ) . by setting @xmath63 and @xmath44 ,",
    "the threshold power @xmath64 can be simplified to @xmath65    * mechanical gain .",
    "* figure 2(a ) shows the mechanical gain @xmath15 and @xmath38 as a function of the optical detuning @xmath39 with @xmath42 , using the experimentally feasible parameter values @xcite",
    ", i.e. @xmath66 m , @xmath17 = 50ng , @xmath67thz , @xmath68mhz , @xmath69mhz and @xmath70mhz .",
    "clearly , in the cooling regime ( with @xmath71 ) , @xmath38 is negative and can be further enhanced by the defects ( as firstly revealed in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the positive gain in the lasing regime ( with @xmath72 ) is also significantly affected by the tls - phonon coupling .",
    "in particular , the phonon lasing is most preferable at @xmath73 , where the defect - induced reduction in @xmath38 is minimized .",
    "if we further set @xmath42 , optimized phonon lasing is achieved ( see the supplementary materials ) .",
    "more interestingly , fig.2(b ) shows an unexpected evolution for @xmath38 with increasing defect loss rate : the mechanical gain @xmath38 first decreases with increasing tls decay rate , until a critical value of @xmath13 . when this exceeds the critical value , @xmath38 increases with increasing defect loss .",
    "consequently the phonon laser threshold power @xmath74 first increases and then decreases again with increasing tls damping , as shown in the supplementary materials .",
    "these counterintuitive results are reminiscent of the loss - induced suppression and revival of lasing @xcite and the loss - induced transparency @xcite demonstrated previously in coupled optical resonators and coupled waveguides .",
    "* supermode spectrum .",
    "* to understand this unconventional loss - induced effect intuitively , we use a simplified model to describe the defect - assisted lasing process , with only the @xmath75 phonon mode and the lossy tls .",
    "the effective hamiltonian of this simplified model reads @xmath76 with the effective mechanical damping rate @xmath77    .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as @xmath42 , @xmath40 , and @xmath78.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ] .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as @xmath42 , @xmath40 , and @xmath78.,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]     versus the pump power @xmath35 ( a ) and the damping rate @xmath13 ( b ) , with the fixed value @xmath79 .",
    "also we take @xmath45 in ( a ) , and @xmath80 , @xmath81 in ( b ) .",
    ", width=316 ]    we note that a similar route was adopted in a recent experiment for an ( anti-)@xmath0-symmetric atomic system @xcite where , by starting from a hermitian hamiltonian describing atom - light interactions , an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian was deduced for two spin - wave excitation channels ( see also ref.@xcite ) . choosing two basis states @xmath82 and @xmath83 to diagonalize @xmath84 leads to the eigenvalues @xmath85\\nonumber\\\\ & \\pm\\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{4n_b g^2_d+\\left[\\omega_q-\\omega_m - i(\\gamma_q-\\gamma^{\\prime}_m ) \\right]^2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the supermode spectrum ( real and imaginary parts of these eigenvalues ) is shown in fig.3(a , b ) , where an ep is clearly seen , at the positions close to the turning points in fig.2(b ) .",
    "the emergence of an ep in this system can be explained as follows : the composite system corresponds to a @xmath0-symmetric system where the mechanical gain in the optomechanical resonator partially or completely compensates the loss of the defect tls .",
    "when @xmath13 is smaller than a critical value , the system is in the unbroken ( exact ) @xmath0-symmetric phase where the supermodes are almost equally distributed between the optomechanical resonator and the defect tls , and the active phonon mode partially or completely compensates the loss induced by the defect tls . as a result ,",
    "the system has less net mechanical gain as the defect loss @xmath13 is increased .",
    "if @xmath13 increases beyond the critical value , the supermodes become increasingly localized such that one dominantly resides in the optomechanical resonator and the other in the tls .",
    "this is the broken-@xmath0 phase . as a result , the supermode in the optomechanical resonator experiences less and less loss with increasing @xmath13 , leading to an increasing net mechanical gain .",
    "the supermode which is dominant in the tls , on the other hand , experiences increasingly more loss and has negligible effect on the mechanical gain .",
    "the transition from the exact- to broken-@xmath0 phase takes place at an ep @xcite , and we label the critical value of @xmath13 at the ep as @xmath86 . thus in this composite system of the optomechanical resonator and defect tls",
    ", the region @xmath87 corresponds to the exact @xmath0-phase , whereas the region where @xmath88 corresponds to the broken-@xmath0 phase .",
    "note that at @xmath44 , the ep of the system emerges at @xmath89 , while the turning point of @xmath38 is obtained , by setting @xmath90 , as @xmath91 the slight shift of the turning point from the exact ep position is due to the fact that @xmath92 depends on @xmath39 , while the ep does not ( see also ref.@xcite and the supplementary materials ) .",
    "we note that the mechanism outlined here for our composite system formed by the com resonator and defect is similar to that which led to an ep observed in an open quantum system composed of a single atom and a high-@xmath93 optical cavity @xcite .    * phonon number in the lasing region .",
    "* figure 4 shows the dependence of the phonon number @xmath94 \\nonumber\\ ] ] on the defect loss and the pump power .",
    "features similar to those observed for the mechanical gain also appear for @xmath95 , i.e. more loss leads to the suppression of @xmath95 in the @xmath0-symmetric regime but it is enhanced in the @xmath0-breaking regime .",
    "the tuning point of @xmath95 is in exact correspondence with that of the mechanical gain , as shown in fig .",
    "2(b ) or the threshold power ( see the supplementary material ) . figure 4(b ) shows that @xmath95 is strongly dependent on the optical detuning , and the optimized condition @xmath43 , as in the situation without any defect , still holds in this system .",
    "in summary , we have studied the defect - assisted phonon lasing in coupled passive resonators .",
    "we find that , in contrast to intuitive expectations , the mechanical gain is not always suppressed with more defect loss .",
    "the exact evolutions of the mechanical gain and the threshold power , starting from the hermitian full system , depicts a turning point as the loss is increased .",
    "this is found to be closely related to the emergence of an ep in an effective non - hermitian phonon - defect system . by suitably choosing the system parameters , the active phonon mode and the lossy defect mode , coupled via the mechanical strain @xcite ,",
    "can be enforced into an unconventional @xmath0-breaking regime , where both the mechanical gain and the phonon number are enhanced despite increasing loss .",
    "our findings suggest an acoustic analog of loss - induced suppression and revival of an optical laser demonstrated in experiments @xcite .",
    "this indicates a novel and counterintuitive way to improve the performance of a phonon laser ; that is by tuning the lossy defects , instead of adding any active dopants . this is important because the tls energy splitting and damping rate are not only determined by the material strain @xcite , but they can also be controlled by steering external electric fields @xcite , opening the way for electrically - tuned phonon lasing in com systems .",
    "our future works along this direction includes the study of ep - assisted quantum nonlinear com @xcite , the defect - induced transparency @xcite , and the defect - mediated sensing or transducing @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that although we have developed the formalism for com systems , the same concept can be extended to nanoelectromechanical devices in which phonon lasing has been achieved @xcite .",
    "* optomechanics in the supermode picture . * to derive the hamiltonian in the supermode picture",

    "we assume that the mean values of these noise operators are zero , i.e. @xmath112 the fluctuations are small and we neglect the noise operators in our numerical calculations . then the defect - assisted mechanical gain and the threshold power of the phonon lasing can be obtained , see the main text ( for more details of the derivations and more related results , see the supplementary materials ) .    99    kippenberg , t. j. & vahala , t. j. cavity optomechanics : back - action at the mesoscale .",
