    "nova explosions are caused by thermonuclear runaways on white dwarfs accreting hydrogen from a main sequence companion in a cataclysmic variable .",
    "the explosive burning of hydrogen on the top of a co or an one degenerate core leads to the synthesis of some @xmath12 unstable nuclei , such as 13 , 14 , 15 , 17 and 18 .",
    "these nuclei have short lifetimes ( @xmath51 - 2 minutes for 14 , 15 and 17 , @xmath515 min for 13 and @xmath53 hours for 18 ) , and they emit a positron when they decay . these positrons annihilate with electrons leading to the emission of photons with energy less or equal to 511 kev . furthermore , other medium- and long - lived radiocative nuclei are synthesized in classical novae : 7 ( @xmath13=77days ) , whichs emits a photon of 478 kev after an electron capture , 22 ( @xmath13=3.75yr ) and 26 ( @xmath13=1.04@xmath14 yr ) , which experience a @xmath12-decay emitting photons of 1275 and 1809 kev , respectively .",
    "thus , classical novae are potential @xmath4-ray emitters , as was pointed out in previous works ( clayton & hoyle @xcite , clayton @xcite , leising & clayton @xcite )",
    ". there are also some previous works concerning nucleosynthesis in classical novae ( see politano et al @xcite , prialnik & kovetz @xcite and references therein for nucleosynthesis in one and co novae , respectively , as well as hernanz et al @xcite , jos et al @xcite , jos & hernanz @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "but to our knowledge there are no previous works which follow all the phases ( from the accretion stage to the final explosion and mass ejection phases ) and couple them to the study of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae .    in this paper",
    "we have used realistic profiles of densities , velocities and chemical compositions ( obtained by means of a hydrodynamical code ) to determine the production and transfer of @xmath4-rays ( by means of a monte - carlo code ) during nova explosions . in this way , we are able to do a detailed analysis of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae and predict their detectability by instruments onboard the cgro ( see our previous paper by hernanz et al for our first results and their relation to the future mission integral ) .",
    "we are mainly concerned by the emission and potential detectability of individual novae , related to the decay of the medium - lived nuclei 7 and 22 ( besides of the short - lived nuclei 13 and 18 ) .",
    "in table 1 we present the main properties of the ejecta of some of the most representative models we have computed ( accretion rate 2@xmath15.yr@xmath16 ) . there is an important difference between co and one novae : co novae are important producers of 7 ( thus line emission at 478 kev is expected during some days ) , whereas one novae are important producers of 22 ( thus line emission at 1275 kev during the first years after the explosion is expected ) .",
    "this can clearly be seen by comparing the @xmath4-ray spectra of a typical co nova ( co1 ) and those of an one one ( one2 ) , shown in figure 1 for different epochs after the explosion . in all cases",
    "a continuum component , mainly below 511 kev , appears as well as some lines ( 511 kev in all cases and 478 kev and 1275 kev in co and one novae , respectively ) .",
    "two phases can be distinguished in the evolution of all models . during the early expansion , the ejected envelope is optically thick and there is an important contribution of the continuum below 511 kev , related to the comptonization of 511 kev photons .",
    "later on , when the envelope becomes optically thin , absorption and comptonization become negligible ; therefore , the intensity of the lines is exclusively determined by the total mass of the radioactive nuclei 7 ( co novae ) and 22 ( one novae ) .",
    "the main properties of the lines are shown in table 2 .",
    "it is worth noticing that fluxes are rather low , due to the small ejected masses ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this explains the null results of the observations of the 1275 kev emission by some novae made with comptel onboard cgro ( iyudin et al @xcite ) .",
    "our predicted fluxes are fully compatible with the upper limits obtained in that work .",
    "it is also worth noticing the important fluxes associated with the 511 kev line that we predict for all models ( see table 2 ) .",
    "this flux should be detected by the current instruments onboard the cgro , provided that novae are observed very early after their explosion .",
    "a retrospective analysis of the batse data would perhaps provide important clues to this issue ( see fishman et al @xcite ) .",
    "we want to mention that there is a lack of agreement between all the theoretical models of novae ( including ours ) and some observations of ejected masses of classical novae , although large uncertainties affect sometimes the determination of observed ejected masses .",
    "for instance , our model one1 fits quite well the observed abundances of the neon nova qu vul 1984 , but observations of this nova give an ejected mass that can reach @xmath17(saizar et al 1992 ) , almost two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical one .",
    "thus the flux of the 1275 kev line could be considerably larger , but no theoretical models are by now able to produce simultaneously such large ejected masses and neon in the ejecta .",
    ".main properties of the ejecta one hour after peak temperature .",
    "initial mass , total ejected mass and ejected mass of the most relevant radioactive nuclei are in and the mean kinetic energy of the ejecta , @xmath18 , is in erg.g@xmath16 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     ( 15,8 ) ( 0,0)(7,8 ) ( 7.5,0)(7,8 )    in figure 2 we show the light curves of the 478 and 1275 kev lines for co and one models , respectively .",
    "for the 478 kev line two different phases can be distinguished : during the first @xmath51.5 days , the line is completely dominated by the continuum generated by 13 and 18 decays , whereas later on the line follows the typical light curve of the 7 radioactive decay , with @xmath13=77 days .",
    "the 1275 kev line has a rise phase lasting @xmath57days , followed by a decline related to the decay of 22 .",
    "the small fluxes obtained make it impossible to detect this line with the current cgro instruments , unless a very close explosion occurs ( the same as for the future spi instrument onboard integral ) .    concerning the light curve of the 511 kev line for all the models , as several isotopes , with different decay timescales ,",
    "contribute to this emission , its temporal evolution is somewhat complex . besides one very early maximum appearing in the co novae ( related to 13 decay ) , one later maximum appears in all cases at @xmath5 6 hours ( see table 2 ) , which is related to 18 decay .",
    "the further development of the light curves is different in the co and in the one cases : in the one case , as 22 emits a e@xmath19 when it decays , the emission at 511 kev lasts for a longer time ( as the 22 decay- timescale is much longer than the 18 one ) .",
    "an early observation of a nova explosion , either of a co or an one one , would provide a positive detection of the 511 kev line ( an estimation of the detection distance of our novae by the future spi instrument onboard integral yields around 10 kpc for all of them except for the low - mass co1 model ) .",
    "( 15,8 ) ( 0,0)(7,8 ) ( 7.5,0)(7,8 )",
    "we have developed a monte - carlo code in order to treat the production and transfer of @xmath4-rays in nova envelopes , coupled to a hydrodynamical code that provides realistic profiles of all the relevant magnitudes .",
    "thus a complete view of the nova explosion is obtained .",
    "the most relevant features of the @xmath4-ray emission of classical novae are their intense 511 kev emission , lasting only some hours , the 478 kev emision in the case of co novae , related to 7 decay , and the 1275 kev emission in the case of one novae , related to 22 decay .",
    "the 1275 kev emission is the most long - lived one , but the fluxes obtained are too low to be detected for novae at typical distances , thus explaining the negative detections of the novae observed up to now by comptel .",
