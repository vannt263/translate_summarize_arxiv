    "if @xmath26 is a fission of @xmath7 , we will say that @xmath7 _ divides _ @xmath26 .",
    "the most natural follow - up questions to ask are those related to divisibility of numbers .",
    "for instance , given a geograph , we can trivially represent it as the fission of another smaller graph :    every halving line graph @xmath7 divides the 2-path graph .",
    "we can segmentarize @xmath7 , divide vertices into left and right halves and move these halves away from each other , so that each half is a cluster .    as we mentioned",
    "before if @xmath7 divides @xmath26 , then @xmath8 divides @xmath72 .",
    "the following lemma follows :    if @xmath7 has @xmath73 vertices , where @xmath74 is prime , then it only has two divisors itself and the two - path .",
    "as we mentioned before , fission is a transitive operation , so divisibility is transitive as well .",
    "are there  prime \" halving geographs ? if fission is similar to multiplication , what are prime building blocks of halving edges graphs ?",
    "let us call a halving edges graph _ primitive _ if it only divides itself and 2-path . clearly if the geograph in question has @xmath73 vertices , where @xmath74 is prime , then it is primitive . are there other non - trivially primitive graphs ?",
    "the graph that is a cross of a 6-star and a 2-path is primitive .",
    "the only possibility for this to be a non - trivial fission is for it to be a 2-fission of a connected graph with 4 vertices .",
    "then by corollary  [ thm : fissionconcor ] each connected component has to have at least 4 vertices .",
    "contradiction .",
    "we can imitate the proof above to easily produce other primitive underlying geographs which do not have @xmath73 vertices , with several connected components .",
    "however , it is unclear whether there exists a primitive connected halving edges graph ; this poses an interesting object of study for future exploration into fission and divisibility .",
