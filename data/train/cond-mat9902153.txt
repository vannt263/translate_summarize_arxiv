    "one of the most promising future applications of the bose - einstein condensates of magnetically trapped atoms is the possible realization of efficient atom lasers , whose experimental proof of principle has already been given @xcite .",
    "an essential element of any atom laser is the process of outcoupling from the trapped bose - einstein condensate . in @xcite",
    "an @xmath0-field was used to coherently transfer atoms from the trapped state to untrapped magnetic sublevels within the same hyperfine manifold of states , enabling them to leave the trap under the influence of gravity .",
    "another outcoupling scheme presently being explored experimentally @xcite is based on raman transitions in an external optical field .",
    "the theory of outcoupling from bose - einstein condensates has been developed in a number of papers @xcite .",
    "the theory is based on the gross - pitaevskii equations for the macroscopic wave functions of the atoms in the trapped and untrapped magnetic sublevels , coherently coupled by the externally imposed electromagnetic field . in @xcite",
    "the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations for two magnetic sublevels were solved numerically in 1 dimension for a number of cases , and various dynamical regimes were identified . in @xcite a detailed comparison of numerical and experimental results was given .",
    "in @xcite the regime of weak outcoupling was considered and in this limit an approximate analytical solution of essentially the same theoretical model as in @xcite and @xcite was given .",
    "the weak outcoupling regime is defined physically by the condition that the rabi oscillations induced by the electromagnetic fields in a certain resonance zone within the condensate are slow on the time scale on which the driven atoms leave that zone .",
    "an experimental study @xcite of this regime was recently performed . in this limit",
    "the outcoupling proceeds at an approximately time - independent perturbatively calculable rate @xcite , and the reduced effective condensate dynamics can be described by a markoff process , similar to the familiar markovian description of a lossy laser mode .",
    "the opposite regime of strong outcoupling , where the atoms move very slowly on the time - scale of the rabi cycles , has also been seen in numerical simulations @xcite but has not yet been studied theoretically in detail . in fact , the experimental realization of an atom laser in @xcite operated in this regime , which is therefore of practical as well as theoretical interest . in the present paper we give an approximate analytical solution of the coupled gross - pitaevskii equation in the regime of strong outcoupling .",
    "this will be done by a method similar to that of @xcite,@xcite for the solution of the time - dependent gross - pitaevskii equation ,",
    "the model of the outcoupling process we shall analyse in this paper is essentially that of ref .",
    "@xcite , but with allowance for the action of gravity , which is actually very important @xcite , at least in the case of microwave or @xmath0-field outcoupling , for extracting the outcoupled atoms from the trap .",
    "thus we consider a coupled set of gross - pitaevskii equations for the macroscopic wave function @xmath1 in the different internal atomic states , e.g. zeeman sublevels , labelled by @xmath2 .",
    "we shall assume that the interaction energy between the atoms is a functional of the total density of the atoms @xmath3 only and not dependent on the internal state @xmath2 .",
    "this assumption is rather well satisfied within a hyperfine manifold of fixed total spin quantum number @xmath4 , but we shall use it as a simple model assumption also for levels with different @xmath4-values . then the coupled gross - pitaevskii equations for @xmath0-outcoupling from an @xmath5 hyperfine manifold or microwave oucoupling between two different hyperfine states take the form : @xmath6 @xmath7 is the atomic mass , @xmath8 describes the effective low - energy scattering potential with scattering length @xmath9 .",

    "the only differencebetween these two cases turns out to be the pattern of the rabi - oscillations , seen directly in figs.[3 ] , [ 4 ] .",
    "fig.[7 ] shows the expansion of the thomas - fermi radius for a case where the time - averaged potential seen by the atoms is repulsive .",
    "the expansion again starts out with constant acceleration and crosses over to an expontial phase even while the outcoupling fields are on .",
    "the third possibility for the evolution of @xmath132 is portrayed in fig.[6 ] , which applies to the case where the time - averaged trapping potential seen by the atoms in the outcoupling field remains attractive .",
    "the thomas - fermi radius oscillates in this case around its new enlarged equilibrium value either until dissipation takes over ( neglected throughout this work , which is justified if only a few oscillation cycles are considered ) or until the outcoupling fields are switched off .",
    "if this is done at a moment where most atoms are in the outcoupled state , which may be untrapped or antitrapped , a ballistic or exponential expansion follows the oscillations , respectively .",
    "the complete evolution of the density of atoms outcoupled to an untrapped state is shown in fig.[8 einschub3 ] .",
    "it becomes clear from our treatment that external electromagnetic fields inducing rapid rabi oscillations are excellent tools for suddenly changing or effectively turning off the trapping potential , thereby exciting the center of mass and the dilation - compression modes of the condensate .",
    "a further freedom in the possible changes of the effective trapping potential is the introduction of a constant overall detuning of the rabi oscillations , if @xmath20 is chosen in such a way that nowhere in the condensate the resonance condition is satisfied .",
    "then only a small fraction of the atoms in the condensate is coupled out by each pulse of the external fields . the strong - coupling limit in this case",
    "is reached if the effective rabi frequency , including the detuning , is large compared to the variation of the detuning across the condensate .",
    "our treatment , in which resonance was assumed , may easily be extended to this case .",
    "as long as the external electromagnetic field is on , the condensate is not yet coupled out , unless the antitrapped states to which it is coupled happens to be more strongly repelled by the magnetic trap than the trapped states are attracted , which is the case @xmath161 in eq.([eq:3.11 ] ) . in all other cases , how many atoms are finally coupled out depends crucially on the phase @xmath211 of the rabi cycle at the moment when the electromagnetic field is switched off . in figs.[8 einschub1]-[8 einschub3 ] we have chosen the switch - off time @xmath169 in such a way that the outcoupled state has its maximum occupation probability precisely equal to or at least close to 1 .",
    "a comparison of these figures , and of the formulas to which they correspond , shows that outcoupling to an untrapped state as in fig.[8 einschub3 ] rather than an antitrapped state as in figs.[8 einschub1 ] , [ 8 einschub2 ] is highly preferrable to achieve a spatially confined , narrow pulse , as the spatial width of the pulse in the antitrapped states is rapidly broadened by the repelling trap potential .",
    "however , the coherence of the outcoupled atom wave should permit a refocussing of the outcoupled pulse by the techniques developed in atom optics .    we have followed the dynamics of the atoms only in the region of space where they feel the parabolic part of the trap potential . in order to follow them further as they leave the trap and",
    "finally become freely propagating atoms it is necessary to make detailed assumptions about the trapping potential far from the center of the trap . if this can be done for a given experiment one may use semiclassical methods to solve the schrdinger equation for the atoms @xcite , eventually neglecting their interaction if the atomic beam hasbecome sufficiently dilute .",
    "this neglection is possible as soon as the @xmath212-term in the equation of motion for @xmath213 has become negligible .",
    "our present results for the region inside the trapping potential provides the initial or boundary condition which is required for such a further analysis .",
