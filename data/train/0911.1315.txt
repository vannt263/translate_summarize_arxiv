    "one of the main puzzles of cosmology is why a model as @xmath4cdm , implying so many conceptual problems , apparently fits all linear data in such unrivalled fashion @xcite .",
    "it is then important that the fine tuning paradox of @xmath4cdm is eased in cosmologies where dark energy ( de ) is a self  interacting scalar field @xmath5 ( dde cosmologies ) , with no likelihood downgrade @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , only cosmological observables can provide information on the form of the self  interaction potential , even though several researchers incline to priviledge potentials allowing tracking solutions .    when aiming to obtain information on the physical potential , the basic observable is however the evolution of the de scale parameter , @xmath6 . here",
    "@xmath7 is the scale factor of a spatially flat metric @xmath8 while @xmath9 is the redshift .",
    "the analysis of available data , made by the wmap team @xcite , was able to constrain the coefficients @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the expression",
    "@xmath10 putting again into evidence that a model with @xmath11 is close to top likelihood , but also stressing a preference for the phantom area ( @xmath12 ) , which is hardly consistent with current tracking potentials .    the main tool , to go beyond these constraints on the @xmath6 law ,",
    "will be tomographic shear analyses @xcite , able to reconstruct the spectrum of density fluctuations at various @xmath9 s , with a precision approaching 1@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "this work is therefore focused on the relevance of spectral predictions , and aims at providing a tool to ease the determination of model spectra . within this context , it is essential to outline the spectral equivalence criterion ( sec ) .    it has been noted since a few years @xcite that the density fluctuation spectra @xmath14 , up to @xmath15mpc@xmath16 , essentially depend on the distance from the lsb ( last scattering band ) .",
    "this was first verified at @xmath17 @xcite and then tested at higher @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "@xmath18body simulations show that the sec is however true when model parameters are suitably tuned .",
    "let us be more specific on this point : when a given @xmath6 is considered , it is easy to determine the comoving distance of the lsb .",
    "keeping then the same values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , we can seek a constant@xmath2 cosmology with the same distance from the lsb ; @xcite tested that the spectra of these two cosmologies coincide ( within @xmath21 ) .",
    "they also saw that , when @xmath22 values are explored , spectral discrepancies are mostly greater , in the range of a few percents .",
    "-2.4truecm     curves , yielding the marginalized model likelihood on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , as obtained from the lambda nasa site .",
    "the reproduction device is detailed in the text .",
    "also 0.5 and 1.5@xmath23 curves are provided .",
    "crosses indicates models for which the sec was explicitly tested at various @xmath9 s . ]",
    "-.6truecm    -.3truecm [ elly ]    the sec however works also at @xmath22 , provided that the distance between such @xmath9 and the lsb is evaluated and a constant@xmath2 auxiliary model is defined , with an equal distance between @xmath9 and the lsb .",
    "the assigned cosmology and the auxiliary model must also have equal @xmath19 , @xmath20 _ at @xmath17 _ , while @xmath24 must be tuned in order that , at @xmath9 , the _ r.m.s . _ density fluctuations of the two models , on the @xmath25mpc scale , coincide @xcite .",
    "let us outline , in particular , that the sec does not require that the auxiliary model shares the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the assigned @xmath22 . in fact , by multiplying the critical density definition by @xmath26 , one has @xmath27 so that the assigned cosmology and the auxiliary model share the values of @xmath28 at any @xmath9 , and this is enough .",
    "this comes as no surprise , however : most linear feature , _",
    "e.g. _ bao s , essentially depend just on @xmath29 .",
    "this recipe , however , prescribes a different constant@xmath2 at any @xmath9 and is somehow curious that , starting from the assigned @xmath6 , one builds a @xmath30 law , completely different from it . in a similar way , one can build a @xmath31 dependence from @xmath9 , in order that auxiliary models be fairly normalized at any @xmath9 .",
    "examples of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are provided by @xcite .",
    "the scope of this work , instead , amounts to applying the sec to models with @xmath6 of the form ( [ wa ] ) and consistent with data , exploring decreasing likelihood ellypsoids .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in the next section we shall discuss how one can rebuild the likelihood ellypsoids on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane .",
    "this section defines the parameter @xmath34 used in the plots which are one of the results of this work . in section 3 we shall then discuss such plots .",
    "finally , section 4 will be devoted to drawing our conclusions .",
    "solid lines in figure [ elly ] reproduce the likelihood ellypsoids on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane of figure 14 in @xcite .",
    "it is significant to explain how such reproduction is obtained , as the technique used is also essential to build the forthcoming figures , where a parameter @xmath34 appears , which are one of the results of this work . in a sense , in this way we pass from an eulerian @xmath0@xmath1 description to a lagrangian @xmath34 description , also stressing the simmetries of the likelihood .",
    "dashed lines in figure [ elly ] approximately yield 0.5 and 1.5@xmath23 s ; they are defined as the locus of points of equal @xmath34 exactly at the center of the intervals between top likelihoods and 1 @xmath23 or 1 and 2@xmath23 s .",
    "the technique we shall describe to draw curves on a plane , named after _ bzier _ , is largely used in vector graphics to model smooth curves which can be scaled indefinitely , without any bound , by the limits of rasterized images .",
    "for instance , imaging systems like postscript , use cubic bzier curves : @xmath35.\\ ] ] the vector * b * runs on the @xmath0@xmath1 plane , describing a curve when @xmath36 varies from 0 to 1 .",
    "the curve is fixed by the positions of the points @xmath37 ( k=0, ... ,3 ) . in eq .",
    "( [ bezier ] ) , @xmath38 indicates a vector ending on the very @xmath39 point .",
    "the curve starts at @xmath40 and is initially directed toward @xmath41 ; however , it bends soon , owing to the setting of all other points ; for @xmath42 , it meets @xmath43 , its final direction being set by @xmath44 .",
    "clearly , it hits neither @xmath41 nor @xmath45 : these points only provide directional information , while the distance @xmath46@xmath47 tells us how persistently the curve moves towards @xmath41 ; an analogous effect , at the end of the run , is fixed by the distance @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "quadratic and cubic bzier curves are mostly used ; when more complex shapes are needed , rather than making recourse to higher degree curves , numerically expensive to evaluate , lower degree bzier curves are patched together . in our specific case , the ellypsoid is shared in four paths , each described by an expression ( [ bezier ] ) .",
    "let us then label the paths with @xmath50 ; we can follow the whole ellypsoid with a single parameter @xmath51 $ ] by labelling the paths with an index @xmath50 ( @xmath52 ) and setting @xmath53 ; accordingly , it shall be @xmath54 using the postscript file of figure 14 in @xcite , we can easily obtain the @xmath55 coordinates of the @xmath37 points of each path . in table 1",
    "we report such points for 1@xmath23 and 2@xmath23 ellypsoids , converted into @xmath0@xmath1 units .",

    "in the lower frame , the @xmath74 ratio is also shown , as a function of @xmath34 . even in the most furtunate cases ,",
    "provided that the _ true _ cosmology is not a constant@xmath2 one , discrepancies are hardly below 10@xmath13 and are greatest at @xmath9 approaching zero .",
    "another point concerning model fitting is that a systematic mapping of ( reasonable ) dde cosmologies , in order to fit future data , is apparently unnecessary . at each @xmath9 , in fact , there will be a constant@xmath2 model able to fit any dde cosmology .",
    "dde will then be revealed by the @xmath2 dependence on @xmath9 , as above outlined . at present , well approximated analytical expressions of @xmath78 , at different @xmath9 , are provided by the so  called _ halofit _ formulae , holding for @xmath4cdm cosmologies @xcite . some attempt to generalize _ halofit _ to constant",
