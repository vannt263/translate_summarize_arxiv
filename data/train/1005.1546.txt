    "including of the magnetic field ( the full dynamo regime with magnetic energy comparable with the kinetic energy on the order of magnitude ) does not change structure of the convective patterns too much @xcite . in the same time",
    "spectra of the magnetic energy are quite different and have no well - pronounced maximum at @xmath62 .",
    "increase of rayleigh number leads to decrease of the relative role of rotation and should decrease peak at the kinetic spectra energy what is accordance with spectra for regime r2 , fig .",

    "further increase of @xmath63 should lead to the original kolmogorov state , similar to nr with spectrum law @xmath64 fig .",
    "however we emphasize , that information on the spectra is not enough to judge if the role of rotation is negligible or not and additional analysis is needed .",
    "the argument is the follows : rotation leads to degeneration of the third dimension ( along z - axis ) @xcite . on the other hand in isotropic two - dimensional systems spectraum of the kinetic energy",
    "also have @xmath65-slope , however direction of the energy transfer in the system is inverse .",
    "in contrast to the three dimensional turbulence where energy transfers from the small wave number , where energy is injected , to larger dissipative wave number , in two dimensional turbulence energy transfers from the large wave numbers to the small ones .",
    "so far the quasi - geostrophic turbulence inherits properties of the both systems 2d and 3d , the inverse cascade @xcite , we plan to consider behavior of energy fluxes in the wave space more carefully .",
    "to analyze energy transfer in the wave space we follow @xcite . decompose physical field @xmath66 in sum of low - frequency and high - frequency counterparts : @xmath67 , where @xmath68 for any periodical @xmath66 and @xmath69 one has relation @xcite : @xmath70 where @xmath71 means averaging of @xmath66 over the volume @xmath72 . multiplying the navier - stokes equation by @xmath73 and induction equation by @xmath74 lead to equations of the integral fluxes of kinetic @xmath75 and magnetic @xmath76 energies from @xmath77 to @xmath78 : @xmath79 and for the flux of the lorentz work : @xmath80 introducing @xmath81 leads to obvious relation for @xmath82 in @xmath83-space : @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is a flux of the energy from harmonics with different @xmath83 , @xmath87 is a work of the external forces and @xmath88 is a dissipation .",
    "the accurate form of @xmath89 is : @xmath90 taking into account that @xmath91 one has : @xmath92 , where @xmath93 fig .",
    "6 presents fluxes of kinetic @xmath94 and magnetic @xmath95 energies for the mentioned above regimes .",
    "regime nr for @xmath94 demonstrates well - known behaviour for the direct kolmogorov s cascade in 3d .",
    "for the large scales @xmath96 , these scales are donors , they provide energy to the system . on the other hand harmonics at the large @xmath83",
    ". the two - dimensional turbulence exhibits mirror - symmetrical behaviour relative to the axis of absciss @xcite . in this case",
    "the energy cascade is inverse .",
    "rotation changes behaviour of fluxes of kinetic energy essentially .",
    "the leading order wave number is @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath97 we also observe the direct cascade of energy @xmath98 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath94 is shifted relative to the maximum of the energy to the large @xmath83 as larger as larger @xmath99 . for @xmath100 behaviour",
    "is more complex : for the small @xmath83 the inverse cascade of the kinetic energy takes place @xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand for the larger region of @xmath83 @xmath101 we still have the direct cascade @xmath102 .",
    "increase of @xmath99 leads to narrowing of the region with inverse cascade and increase of inverse flux .",
    "one can suggest , that change of the sign of the flux @xmath94 at @xmath100 is connected with appearance of the non - local energy transfer : so that energy to the large - scales @xmath103 comes from modes @xmath104 , @xmath105 @xcite . in absence of the magnetic field maximum of @xmath106",
    "so , in case with rotation there are two cascades of kinetic energy ( direct and inverse ) tale place simultaneously .",
    "now we consider the magnetic part .",
    "in contrast to @xmath94 , @xmath95 includes not only advective term but the generative term as well .",
    "this leads to positiveness of the integral @xmath95 over all @xmath83 .",
    "moreover @xmath95 is positive for any @xmath83 .",
    "position of maximum of @xmath95 is close to that ones in spectra of @xmath107 .",
    "it is evident , that for the planetary cores distance between maxima in fluxes @xmath95 for nr and r1 , r2 can be quite large , however not so large as @xmath62 .",
    "this statement concerned with condition on magnetic field generation which holds when the local magnetic reynolds number @xmath108 at the scale @xmath109 : @xmath110 and that for the planets @xmath111 . in the same moment fluxes at the small @xmath83 are small , i.e. system is in the state of the statistical equilibrium : dissipation at the small scales is negligible .      fig .",
    "7 demonstrates fluxes of @xmath112 , concerned with magnetic field generation .",
    "the maximum of generation term without rotation is at the large scale , while for the rotating system it is at @xmath113 . interestingly , that for the rotating system there is a region @xmath114 for the large @xmath83 , where magnetic field reinforce convection . for regime nr",
    "@xmath112 drops quickly because of the kinetic energy decrease fig .  5 . as a result",
    "we have : for the rotating system magnetic field is produced by the cyclones , while for the non - rotating system the large - scale dynamo operates .",
    "now we estimate the role of the advective term @xmath115 separately . for the non - rotating @xmath115 and @xmath94",
    "are similar : the direct cascade takes place . for rotating",
    "system region @xmath116 is a source of energy .",
    "in contrast to @xmath94 , @xmath115 has not positive regions at the small @xmath83 , i.e. the inverse cascade of the magnetic energy , concerned with the advective term in this region is absent .",
    "we draw attention to the amplitudes of the fluxes @xmath95 , @xmath112 , @xmath115 : for all three cases hold @xmath117 , i.e. two fluxes of the magnetic energy in the wave space with opposite directions exist . the first flux concerned with the traditional energy transfer of the energy over the spectrum ( advective term ) and the flux of the lorentz work .",
    "the regions of the maximal magnetic field generation coincide with the regions of the most effective magnetic energy transfer @xmath115 ( from small @xmath83 to the large @xmath83 ) .",
    "such a balance leads to equipartition state , when dissipation takes place on the large @xmath83 .",
    "note , that the full magnetic flux fig .",
    "6 @xmath95 is localized at @xmath118 . for the non - rotating system it is because the mean helicity and @xmath31-effect are zero @xcite .",
    "thus the inverse cascade of the magnetic energy to the small @xmath83 is absent .",
    "the magnetic fields of the planets are the main sources of information on the processes in the liquid cores at the times @xmath119yy and more .",
    "if the poloidal part of the magnetic field is observable at the planet surface , then the largest component of field ( toroidal ) as well as the kinetic energy distrubution over the scales is absolutely invisible for the observer out of the core .",
    "moreover , due to finite conductivity of the mantle even the poloidal part of the magnetic field is cutted off at @xmath120 . in other words",
    "the observable part of the spectra at the planets surface is only a small part ( not even the largest ) of the whole spectra of the field .",
    "that is why importance of the numerical simulation is difficult to overestimate .",
    "here we showed that in considered quasigeostrophic state the both cascades ( direct and inverse ) exsist simulataneously .",
    "that is a challenge for a turbulent models in the geodynamo .",
    "the other interesting point is a balance of the magnetic energy flux due two mechanisms : advection and generation .",
    "this balance is reason why the exponential growth of the magnetic energy is stopped at the end of the kinematic dynamo regime ."
