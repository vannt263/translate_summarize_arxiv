    "the linear stability ( ls ) analysis of compressible flows is of interest from the viewpoint of basic understanding on transition scenarios in such fluids  @xcite , and also because of its relevance in many high speed aerodynamic design problems .",
    "since the growth of a small disturbance can lead to the flow breakdown , an understanding of different growth mechanisms becomes more relevant .",
    "the normal mode approach , where the initial value problem is reduced to an eigenvalue problem by considering the disturbance growth / decay in terms of an exponential time dependence , has been widely studied in the past . for more than a decade ,",
    "however , the traditional modal stability analysis has been complemented by the analysis of transiently growing perturbations for various shear flow configurations  @xcite .",
    "such transient growth analyses have revealed that a flow can sustain large transient growth of energy in the parameter space that is stable according to the ls theory .",
    "it has been shown that the transient growth analysis can provide a possible reason for the experimentally observed critical reynolds number ( @xmath8 ) of various canonical flow configurations being less than that predicted by the ls theory ( for a detailed review see the recent book of schmid and henningson  @xcite ) .",
    "it is well known that there are flow configurations ( e.g. the plane couette flow , pipe flow , etc . )",
    "that are stable according to the ls theory , but have been shown to have a finite @xmath8 in experiments . therefore the nonlinear effects may destabilize these flows in the stable parameter region of the ls theory .",
    "however , for the nonlinearities in the governing equations to take over , the amplitudes of the disturbances must be large .",
    "therefore , there may be a linear mechanism that causes an infinitesimally small disturbance already present in the flow to grow initially , so that the nonlinearities could act upon them .",
    "such a mechanism for the transient growth exists due to the nonmodal growth caused by the non - orthogonality of the ls operator  @xcite . in the stable region of the parameter space , even though each eigenstate decays during its evolution in space or time , a superposition of such eigenstates has potential for the transient inviscid growth before being stabilized by the viscosity at the rate of the least decaying mode .",
    "the experimental confirmation of this transition scenario comes from the observation that _ streaks _ precede the breakdown of laminar shear flows .",
    "since the transient energy growth is maximum for _ streamwise vortices _ which subsequently give birth to streaks , it suggests that this transient growth mechanism provides a robust route to flow breakdown via disturbances that are stable according to ls theory .",
    "even though the transient growth analysis has been extensively studied for incompressible flows  @xcite , similar studies on compressible flows are scarce  @xcite . for compressible boundary layers , hanifi , schmid and henningson  @xcite",
    "have found the maximum transient energy growth ( @xmath9 ) increases with both reynolds number ( @xmath10 ) and mach number ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "they have used an energy norm such that the pressure - related energy transfer rate is equal to zero .",
    "they also cofirmed that the streamwise vortices are the optimal patterns as in incompressible flows .",
    "farrell and ioannou  @xcite have investigated the transient energy growth of 2d perturbations in the couette flow ( uniform shear flow ) of a polytropic fluid with constant viscosity coefficients .",
    "they found that @xmath9 increases with mach number .",
    "recently , tumin and reshotko  @xcite have developed a ` spatial ' model of transient growth phenomena in compressible boundary layers .",
    "the present work deals with the ` temporal ' stability analyses of the compressible plane couette flow .",
    "the modal linear stability analysis of this flow has been reported by many investigators in the past  @xcite . in the incompressible limit",
    "this flow remains stable but instability is possible for a range of supersonic mach numbers , the origin of which is tied to a family of acoustic modes  @xcite .",
    "duck , erlebacher and hussaini  @xcite have classified these acoustic modes into two distinct families depending on their phase speeds ( see fig .",

    "( i , iii , ... ) that have phase speeds greater than unity in the limit of zero streamwise wavenumber ( @xmath11 ) , and the _ even - modes _ ( ii , iv , ... ) that have phase speeds less than zero as @xmath12 .",

    "hu and zhong  @xcite studied the same viscous plane couette flow problem numerically , and reported new viscous instabilities .",
    "in particular , they showed that the mode - i can become unstable at finite reynolds numbers due to the effects of viscosity but the ranges of mach numbers and wavenumbers are very narrow .",
    "they further showed that the viscosity plays a dual role of stabilizing / destabilizing the mode - ii instability .",
    "the inviscid mode - ii instabilty of duck et al .",
    "that occurs at large @xmath11 is weakly stabilizied by viscosity , but the same mode - ii is also unstable for low streamwise wavenumbers purely due to viscous effects  @xcite .",
    "even though the higher - order even modes ( iv , ... ) can also become unstable , the mode - ii instablity represents the dominant instability for the compressible plane couette flow .    in this paper , the nonmodal transient energy growth analysis is reported for the compressible plane couette flow of an appropriate perfect gas model for three - dimensional disturbances .",

    "we can conclude that the increase of the inviscid energy growth with increasing @xmath2 is primarily due to the increased energy transfer from the mean flow to _",

    "compared to the inviscid eigenfunction @xmath126 , the viscous eigenfunction @xmath125 decays due to viscous dissipation and thermal diffusion ( both of which involve viscosity @xmath36 ) . under the assumed viscosity - law ( [ eqn_viscosity ] ) , the viscosity of the mean flow increases rapidly with increasing mach number at all points in the normal direction ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , resulting in a decrease in the viscous eigenfunction @xmath125 in the same limit . to quantify the last statement , we calculate the following for the viscous problem : @xmath127 which is a measure of the _ collective evolution _ ( growth / decay ) of all eigenfunctions .",

    "the initial condition , @xmath132 , is chosen as @xmath133 .",
    "it should be pointed out that the measure for the collective growth / decay of eigenfunctions , via ( [ eqn_ef ] ) , is equivalent to probing the energy - norm with an unit weight matrix @xmath134 .",
    "our definition simply masks out the mach - number dependence of the energy norm due to the base - state variables in @xmath135 ( as in the mack energy norm ) .    .",
