    "according to core accretion models @xcite , giant gas planets such as jupiter and saturn formed via the accumulation of an protocore of rock and ice which gained solid material until it reached sufficient size to begin accreting the gaseous component of the protosolar nebula .",
    "the existence of solid ice in the outer solar system promotes the rapid growth of the more massive protocores allowing the accretion of large quantities of gas necessary for jupiter - sized planets .",
    "giant planets thus have a dense core of rock and ice surrounded by a h - he envelope .",
    "it is not known , however , whether the initial dense core remains stable following the accretion of the h - he outer layer or whether the core erodes into the fluid hydrogen - rich layers above @xcite .",
    "the gravitational moments of jupiter and saturn , which have been measured by prior planetary missions and will be determined for jupiter with unprecedented accuracy by the upcoming juno mission , may be used in combination with interior models @xcite to estimate the mass of the present - day core , but it is unclear whether these masses correspond to the primordial core mass .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the present - day core mass of jupiter may be too small to explain its formation by core accretion within the relatively short lifetime of the protosolar nebula @xcite , although a more recent jupiter model @xcite predicted a larger core of 1418 earth masses which is consistent with core accretion .",
    "furthermore , direct measurements of jupiter s atmosphere suggest a significant enhancement in the concentration of heavy @xmath0 elements @xcite , but it is unknown to what extent this should be attributed to a large flux of late - arriving planetesimals versus the upwelling of core material . determining the extent of core erosion is thus a major priority for understanding the interiors of giant planets and the process by which they were formed .    in this work we focus on water ice , presumed to be a major constituent of the core , and",
    "consider the question of whether it has significant solubility in fluid metallic hydrogen at conditions corresponding to the core - mantle boundaries of giant gas planets .",
    "water ice is the most prevalent of the planetary ices ( water , methane and ammonia ) which may be assumed to make up the outermost layers of a differentiated rock - ice core @xcite . at the conditions of temperature and pressure prevalent at giant planet cores ,",
    "water ice is predicted @xcite to be in either in a fully atomic fluid phase in which oxygen and hydrogen migrate freely and independently , or in a superionic phase in which oxygen atoms vibrate around defined lattice sites while hydrogen atoms migrate freely . assuming the existence of a core - mantle boundary at which water ice and the fluid h - he phase are in direct contact , the relevant question is the extent to which the system may lower its gibbs free energy by the redistribution of the atoms of the ice phase into the fluid hydrogen . the extreme pressure and temperature conditions prevalent at giant planet core - mantle boundaries ( 800012000k and 818 mbar for saturn , 1800021000k and 3545 mbar for jupiter ) are not yet obtainable in the laboratory , thus _ ab initio _",
    "simulations provide the best available guide to determining the extent of core solubility .",
    "we used density functional molecular dynamics ( dft - md ) calculations and coupling constant integration ( cci ) techniques to compute the gibbs free energy of solvation , @xmath1 , of h@xmath2o in fluid metallic hydrogen , i.e. the change in gibbs free energy when an h@xmath2o molecule is removed from the pure ice phase and dissolved in h. the free energy of solubility is computed from the free energies of three systems : pure ice , pure fluid h , and a mixed system in which the atoms of one water molecule are dissolved in @xmath3 atoms of hydrogen ,    @xmath4 \\label{deltag}\\ ] ]    where @xmath5 is the energy per @xmath6 stoichiometric unit of the ice phase , and @xmath7 is obtained from an appropriately - scaled simulation of 128 h atoms .",
    "this quantity becomes more negative as solubility increases .",
    "a @xmath1 of zero implies a saturation concentration of exactly one h@xmath2o to @xmath3 h. in order to span the range of likely conditions for the core - mantle boundary of jupiter and saturn , we considered pressures of 10 , 20 and 40 mbar , at a range of temperatures from 2000 to 20000  k.    computation of free energies from md simulations is difficult since the entropy term is not directly accessible .",
    "here we use a two - step cci approach as previously applied by several authors @xcite to compute free energies .",
    "the cci method provides a general scheme for computing @xmath8 between systems governed by potential energy functions @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we construct an artificial system @xmath11 whose forces are derived from a linear combination of the potential energies of the two systems @xmath12 . the difference in helmholtz free energy between the two systems",
    "is then    @xmath13    where the average is taken over the trajectories governed by the potential @xmath11 .",
    "we perform two ccis for each @xmath14 calculation : first from the dft - md system to a system governed by a classical pair potential which we fit to the dft dynamics of the system via a force - matching approach @xcite , and then from the classical system to a reference system whose free energy is known analytically .",
    "the material phases in question must be established prior to the gibbs free energy calculations . at the pressure and temperature conditions of interest , hydrogen is a metallic fluid of h atoms in which molecular bonds are not stable .",
    "water dissolved within hydrogen likewise is non - molecular , with a free o atom in an atomic h fluid . for water ice ,",
    "the phase diagram at giant planet core pressures is divided into three regimes @xcite : a low - temperature ( @xmath15  2000  k ) crystalline regime , an intermediate superionic regime in which oxygen atoms vibrate around fixed lattice sites while hydrogen atoms migrate freely , and a higher - temperature fully fluid regime in which both hydrogen and oxygen atoms are mobile .",
    "the transition between the crystalline and superionic regimes has not yet been studied in detail at high pressures but our simulations find that it occurs below 2000  k. the transition from superionic to fully fluid is found to occur in simulation at temperatures ranging from 8000  k for 10 mbar and 13000  k for 50 mbar @xcite .",
    "consequently our study includes the superionic and fully fluid ice phases .",
    "previous studies of superionic ice @xcite have used an _ bcc _",
    "arrangement of atoms for the oxygen sublattice .",
    "we found that such a lattice was stable at all points studied in the superionic regime except for 10 mbar at 2000 and 3000  k. at these conditions we found that the oxygen sublattice was stable in the _ pbca _ geometry which we recently reported to be the most stable zero - temperature structure for ice at 10 mbar @xcite . at 10 mbar and 5000  k , superionic ice with a _",
    "sublattice was stable but the _ pbca _ was not .",
    "the _ bcc _",
    "oxygen sublattice was found to be stable for 20 and 40 mbar pressures at all temperatures studied in the superionic regime .",
    "attempts to perform a superionic simulation in the _ cmcm _ geometry reported by @xcite to be the stable zero - temperature structure at these pressures resulted in an unstable system with a large anisotropic strain .",
    "we thus used a _",
    "oxygen sublattice for all superionic ice simulations , except the 2000  k and 3000  k simulations at 10 mbar which used the oxygen sublattice from the _ pbca _ phase , as indicated in figure 1 .",
    "while we can not yet exclude the possibility of the existence of yet another superionic ice structure , we note that the differences between different ice phase energies are found to be on the order 0.1  ev per h@xmath2o , and thus will not significantly affect our results about the stability of ice in giant planet cores .",
    "our goal in this paper is to study the solubility of water ice in fluid hydrogen . due to considerations arising from the entropy of mixing ,",
    "the solubility of one material in another is never zero , however solubility at trace quantities is not sufficient for core erosion . in particular , we wish to know whether solubility is thermodynamically favored at concentrations significantly greater than the background concentration of oxygen in the fluid envelope of jupiter or saturn  this is equal to approximately one o atom to 1000 h atoms if we assume solar concentrations for the jovian envelope and approximately one part in 300 if we assume a threefold enrichment for oxygen as observed for most other heavy elements @xcite .",
    "we begin by computing the gibbs free energies of solubility for dissolving h@xmath2o in pure h at one part in 125 , and generalize later .",
    "the coupling constant integration approach requires , as an integration end point , a reference system whose free energy may be computed analytically .",
    "it is important to ensure that the system does not undergo a phase change along the integration pathway since this may cause numerical difficulties in the integration . for the fluid systems ,",
    "being pure hydrogen , hydrogen with oxygen , and ice at temperatures above the superionic - to - fluid transition , we used an ideal atomic gas as the reference system @xcite . for superionic ice ,",
    "we use as a reference system a combination of an ideal gas system for the hydrogen atoms with an einstein crystal of oxygen atoms each oxygen tethered to its ideal lattice site with a harmonic potential of spring constant 30  ev/@xmath16 .",
    "the dft - md simulations in this work used the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite with pseudopotentials of the projector augmented wave type @xcite and the exchange - correlation functional of @xcite .",
    "the pseudopotentials used had a core radius of 0.8   for hydrogen and 1.1   for oxygen .",
    "wavefunctions were expanded in a basis set of plane waves with a 900  ev cutoff and the brillouin zone was sampled with @xmath17 @xmath18-points .",
    "the electronic temperature effects were taken into account via fermi - dirac smearing .",
    "a new set of force - matched potentials was fitted for each pressure - temperature conditions for each stoichiometry .",
    "all md simulations used a 0.2  fs timestep . in the classical potential under superionic conditions ,",
    "an additional harmonic potential term was added to ensure that oxygen atoms remained in the appropriate lattice sites , however , we found that in most cases the fitted pair potential alone was sufficient to stabilize the superionic state .",
    "the first step of the free energy calculations was the determination of the appropriate supercell volumes for each system for each set of pressure and temperature conditions .",
    "this was accomplished via constant - pressure md simulations @xcite with a duration of 1.6  ps ( 0.6  ps for ice ) .",
    "dft - md trajectories were then computed in a fixed cell geometry in order to fit classical potentials .",
    "a run of 0.4  ps was found to be sufficient for fitting suitable potential .",
    "we then performed molecular dynamics runs 600 fs long ( 400 fs for ice ) at five @xmath19 values to integrate between the dft and classical systems .",
    "finally , we performed classical metropolis monte carlo at 24 @xmath19 values to integrate from the classical to the reference system .",
    "table i lists the total gibbs free energies for each simulated system ( h@xmath20 , oh@xmath21 and ice ) for each set of temperature and pressure conditions .",
    "ice was confirmed to remain superionic except at the 20  mbar/12000  k and 40  mbar/20000  k conditions where it was fully fluid .",
    "the error bars on the computed @xmath14 values are dominated primarily by the uncertainty in the computed volume at the desired pressure , and secondarily by uncertainty in the @xmath22 term in the coupling constant integration .",
    "these free energies are combined using equation [ deltag ] to give @xmath1 representing the free energy change associated with removing an h@xmath2o from the ice phase and dissolving it in the hydrogen fluid at a concentration of molecule per 125 solute h atoms .",
    "@xmath1 increases strongly with temperature , but shows only a weak dependence on pressure within the 1040 mbar range under consideration .",
    "the @xmath23 values were found to be well converged with respect to wavefunction cutoff , k - point sampling to within the available error bars .",
    "the effect of the electronic entropy term on @xmath24 was found to be less than 0.1 ev in all cases . from a linear interpolation through the adjacent data points we estimated the temperature at which @xmath1 passes through zero as 2400",
    "k @xmath25 200  k at 40 mbar , 2800  k @xmath25 200  k at 20 mbar , and 3400  k @xmath25 600  k at 10 mbar .",
    "as shown in figure 1 , this is clearly far lower than any reasonable estimate for the core - mantle boundaries for either jupiter or saturn .",
    "the onset of high solubility occurs within the portion of the phase diagram where ice is superionic , and does not coincide with either the superionic - to - fluid transition or the crystalline - to - superionic transition in ice .",
    "the total @xmath23 of solubility may be broken down into three components : a @xmath26 term from the potential energy , a @xmath27 term from the volume difference , and a @xmath28 entropic term .",
    "figure 2 shows this breakdown as a function of temperature for 20  mbar .",
    "the breakdown for other pressures looks similar .",
    "the @xmath29 term , representing the difference in chemical binding energy , provides approximately a 2 ev per molecule preference for ice formation at all temperatures where ice is superionic , but a much smaller preference for the 12000  k case where ice is fluid .",
    "the @xmath30 term is indistinguishable from zero within the error bars , suggesting that this is not a pressure - driven transition , in contrast to recent results on the partitioning of noble gases between hydrogen and helium in giant planet interiors in which volume effects were found to be the dominant term @xcite .",
    "the @xmath28 term dominates the temperature - dependent behavior , underlining that ice dissolution is indeed an entropy - driven process .",
    "given the gibbs free energy of solubility for the insertion of one h@xmath2o into 125 h atoms we can determine an approximate gibbs free energy of solubility at other concentrations , by neglecting the contribution of the oxygen - oxygen interaction and including only the entropic term arising from the mixing . under these approximations ,",
    "we obtain the expression    @xmath31 - \\delta g_{sol}[n]}{k_bt } & = & ( m+2 ) \\log \\left ( \\frac{(m+2)v_h + v_o}{(m+2)v_h}\\right)\\nonumber \\\\   & - & ( n+2 ) \\log \\left ( \\frac{(n+2)v_h + v_o}{(n+2)v_h } \\right)\\nonumber \\\\ & - & \\log \\left ( \\frac{m+2}{n+2 } \\right ) , \\label{conc}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the effective volumes of each h and o atom in the fluid .",
    "this approximation becomes invalid as the oxygen - oxygen interaction term in the fluid oxygen phase becomes significant , however for our purposes it is sufficient to know that the saturation concentration is significantly higher than the background concentration .",
    "if a saturation concentration of oxygen in hydrogen does indeed exist then this may be expected to have a retarding effect on the erosion of the core .",
    "we must also consider possibility that hydrogen and oxygen could dissolve separately from the h@xmath2o mixture , leaving behind a condensed phase with stoichiometry other than h@xmath2o .",
    "we tested two cases explicitly , computing the free energies of pure oxygen and one - to - one ho phases at the jupiter - like 40 mbar , 20,000  k set of conditions .",
    "both o and ho were found to be in a fully fluid state at these temperature / pressure conditions .",
    "we found that ho had a free energy of solubility of -11.2 ev per oxygen , while pure oxygen had -22.8 ev per oxygen .",
    "comparing to the -8.9 ev per oxygen solubility of h@xmath2o , this suggests oxygen - rich condensed phases are less thermodynamically stable than the h@xmath2o phase , and certainly far less favourable than dissolution of the dense phase into metallic hydrogen .",
    "we have also neglected the possibility of hydrogen - enriched dense phases such as h@xmath34o .",
    "while it possible such phases may be somewhat energetically preferred to h@xmath2o , it is extremely unlikely that the preference will be strong compared to the @xmath35 ev per o unit preference for solubility .    in figure 3",
    "we plot the estimated @xmath1 as a function of concentration for various computed temperatures at a pressure of 40  mbar .",
    "a negative value of @xmath1 means that it is thermodynamically favorable to dissolve further ice into the hydrogen phase at a given hydrogen - phase ice concentration , and the point at which @xmath1 is zero is the saturation concentration . for 2000",
    "k and 3000  k the saturation concentrations are estimated to be on the order of 1:500 and 1:20 respectively , while for higher temperatures the saturation concentration is much higher .",
    "given that we neglect o  o interactions in the fluid hydrogen phase , it is difficult to precisely determine the saturation concentrations for higher temperatures .",
    "however , we may safely say that the saturation concentration for temperatures in excess of 3000  k is very much greater than the background oxygen concentration , and hence that solubility of ice into hydrogen at the core - mantle boundaries of jupiter and saturn is expected to be strongly thermodynamically favored .",
    "the consequences of core erosion for planetary evolution models have been previously considered by @xcite and later @xcite .",
    "the effects of core erosion can potentially be detected either by orbital probes such as juno or by atmospheric entry probes , since the redistribution of core material throughout the planet will manifest itself both by a smaller core ( detectable from gravitational moments ) and a higher concentration of heavy elements in the atmosphere than would be expected in a planet without core erosion .",
    "once core material has dissolved into the metallic h layers , the rate at which core material can be redistributed throughout the planet is expected to be limited by double diffusive convection @xcite . since the higher density due to compositional gradients of the lower material interferes with the convection process , convection may be slowed significantly .",
    "@xcite modelled the effect of core erosion under the assumptions of fully soluble 30 mbar core in each planet . under their assumptions",
    "up to 19 earth masses could have been redistributed from jupiter s core but only 2 earth masses from saturn s , the difference being jupiter s higher temperatures . while this prediction is subject to significant uncertainty in many aspects of the model ,",
    "it does suggest that a redistribution of a significant fraction of the initial protocore is possible , at least in jupiter .",
    "further refinement of models for the upconvection of core material and its observable consequences may be fruitful .",
    "the effect of core erosion on the heat transport and mass distribution properties of jupiter and saturn should also be taken into account in future static models of these planets interiors .",
    "these calculations can be expanded in several ways .",
    "we have neglected the presence of helium in the hydrogen - rich mantle , however due to the large magnitude of @xmath1 and the chemical inertness of helium we do not expect the presence of helium in the mantle to significantly affect the solubility behavior . we have explicitly made the assumption that ice and hydrogen are in direct contact , an assumption which might fail in one of two ways .",
    "if hydrogen and helium are immiscible at the base of the atmosphere then the core may make direct contact with a helium - rich layer .",
    "this , however , is unlikely in the context of the calculations of @xcite who predict hydrogen - helium immiscibility only far away from the cores of jupiter and saturn .",
    "the other possibility is that the ice layers of the core may be gravitationally differentiated , leaving ice beneath layers of the less dense planetary ices methane and ammonia . since the bonding in these is similar to that in water ice one could assume that they show a similar solubility behavior , but this analysis is the subject of future work .",
    "we have also considered only the structure of the present - day planet . as suggested by @xcite , a proper consideration of core solubility",
    "must also include solubility during the formation process , as dissolution of the icy parts of the core into the accreting hydrogen during the formation may result in the amount of ice on the core itself being small by the time the planet reaches its final size .",
    "a treatment of the formation processes for jupiter and saturn using ice solubilities derived from _ ab initio _ calculations may be valuable .",
    "our calculations strongly suggest that icy core components are highly soluble in the fluid mantle under the conditions prevalent at the core - mantle boundaries of jupiter and saturn .",
    "since many recently - discovered exoplanets are more massive and hence internally hotter than jupiter , it can be expected that any initial icy cores in these exoplanets will also dissolve .",
    "the presence of core erosion may allow models predicting a small present - day jovian core to be made consistent with the large initial core required by core erosion , however models of the interior mass distribution of the planet will need to be revised to take the inhomogeneous composition of the lower layers implied by convection - limited core redistribution into account .",
    "improved models which include core redistribution processes , combined with the data from the juno probe , may assist in understanding the history and present structure of jupiter and other planets in our own and in other solar systems .",
