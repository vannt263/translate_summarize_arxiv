    "<S> entanglement in spatially extended many body systems and quantum field theories is the focus of increasing attention . </S>",
    "<S> part of this is directed at understanding the entanglement properties of noncomplementary parts of a system , such as far apart regions of vacuum @xcite and thermal states @xcite , or widely separated segments in ground states of the bose - hubbard hamiltonian @xcite , chains of trapped ions @xcite and harmonic oscillators @xcite . in this regard relativistic vacua </S>",
    "<S> are especially interesting as they provide us with an oppurtunity to study physical systems with a well defined notion of locality .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the entanglement between arbitrarily distant regions of the free massless dirac vacuum . for bosonic systems , </S>",
    "<S> the expansion of the vacuum in terms of two - mode squeezed states of oscillators residing in the two complementary spacetime wedges @xmath4 and @xmath5 , used in the derivation of the unruh effect , explicitly shows that the vacuum is entangled @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this result is a special case of a general modewise decomposition theorem pertaining to a certain class of bosonic gaussian states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous theorem exists for fermionic gaussian states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( indeed , the unruh effect holds also in the fermionic vacuum @xcite . ) the state of a pair of noncomplementary parts of a system , however , in general is mixed , so that a modewise decomposition is impossible @xcite . working directly with the system s degrees of freedom , </S>",
    "<S> especially when of a great or inifinite number , proves difficult then . a most effective and relatively simple way to tackle </S>",
    "<S> this problem is the use of entanglement distillation protocols . even though such protocols have proved most convenient in the study of the entanglement between abitrarily distant regions of the bosonic vacuum @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the fermionic case has thus far not been expressly addressed . using a previously introduced distillation protocol @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we explicitly show that results analogous to those obtained for the bosonic vacuum are true of the fermionic vacuum as well , namely , that entanglement persists between arbitrarily far - apart regions and that as a function of the ratio of the separation between the regions @xmath1 and their typical scale @xmath2 , the entanglement decays no faster than @xmath3 $ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the concepts of entanglement and locality are nontrivial in fermionic systems . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore begin by explaining them briefly and contrast with the bosonic case . </S>",
    "<S> suppose we have a system of bosonic modes . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath6=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath7=0 $ ] , the hilbert space is a direct product of the hilbert spaces of each of the modes . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is meaningful to consider the entanglement between different sets of modes , with the partition unequivocally defining locality . for fermions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the hilbert space therefore lacks an analogous direct product structure . </S>",
    "<S> if the assignation of sets of modes to different parties is to have any meaning at all ( that is , if we do not want to give up locality ) , we must restrict the set of observables in such a way that acting on an arbitrary composite state of any two distinct sets of modes , say @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with an observable comprised solely of modes in @xmath10 , does not change the expectation values of any observable comprised solely of modes in @xmath11 ( and vice - versa ) , nor increase the entanglement between the sets . </S>",
    "<S> now , let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be arbitrary sums of products of even number of modes in @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , then @xmath14=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is not hard to see that this characteristic of fermionic modes , together with the anti - commutation algebra of the modes , restricts the set of observables to those that can be constructed out of products of an even number of modes @xcite . for pure states entanglement between two sets of modes </S>",
    "<S> is then defined as usual , i.e. a pure composite state of two sets of modes , @xmath15 , is entangled iff there exist observables @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> of course this is not true of mixed states . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , except in @xmath17 and @xmath18 dimensions @xcite , no necessary and sufficient criterion to establish mixed state entanglement is known , regardless of the statistics .    moving on to relativistic quantum field theory ( qft ) </S>",
    "<S> , the requirement of lorentz covariance and that the energy spectrum be bounded from below constrains the set of possible algebras of modes to the familiar commutation / anti - commutation relations for bosons / fermions . </S>",
    "<S> as an example consider the dirac field @xmath19 the subscripts denote the spinorial indices , which together with the position @xmath20 label the modes . </S>",
    "<S> if in addition we want the theory to be causal , we must require that observables be respresented by bilinear expressions in the fields .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note that there is a difference in what is meant by `` local '' in quantum information theory ( qit ) and qft settings . </S>",
    "<S> as explained above , in qit it is the different parties that define locality . </S>",
    "<S> however , in qft it is causality which defines locality , i.e. an operator acting at two or more spacelike related coordinates is nonlocal </S>",
    "<S> . in this paper , locality in the qit sense enters via the assignation of causally disconnected regions to different parties , leaving us with much greater latitude in our choice of `` local '' operations than that afforded by the tight constraints of qft .    </S>",
    "<S> the protocol employed in @xcite consists of the finite duration coupling of a pair of initially nonentangled two - level point - like detectors to the studied field , in its vacuum state , at two different locations . </S>",
    "<S> the duration of the coupling determines the size of the regions `` probed '' and is taken to be much smaller than the distance between the detectors , which therefore remain causally disconnected . under these conditions , </S>",
    "<S> a final entangled state of the detectors means that entanglement persists between the regions . </S>",
    "<S> a similar but suitably adjusted protocol is employed here . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore make use many of the results obtained in @xcite , and forego rederivation .    </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation is given by @xmath21 where the @xmath22 and @xmath23 are any @xmath24 matrices satisfying @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 . in the absence of a mass term , in the weyl representation of the @xmath22 and @xmath23 </S>",
    "<S> , the dirac equation decouples into a pair of equations , the weyl equations @xmath28 where the @xmath29 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> the two - component fields @xmath30 and @xmath31 describe right and left handed particles and anti - particles , that is quanta of positive and negative helicity , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we can therefore begin by studying a vacuum of definite handedness , say the right handed vacuum . in terms of a fourier expansion @xmath32 @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are the creation and annihilation operators for right handed particles and anti - particles , respectively , satisfying @xmath37 with all other anti - commutators vanishing , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the corresponding two - component `` spinorial '' coefficients and are understood to be normalised to unity .    due to the fact that the field is fermionic , we must couple to field bilinears to realise the distillation protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see earlier discussion . ) </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most natural choice is the field s charge density @xmath40 , where for convenience we have chosen to normal order ( @xmath41 ) . setting up a pair of two - level detectors at @xmath42and @xmath43 , in the dirac interaction picture </S>",
    "<S> the coupling term is given by @xmath44 here @xmath45 governs the strength and duration of the coupling , and @xmath46 is the energy gap of detector @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding evolution operator is @xmath48 $ ] , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 denoting time - ordering and the duration of the interaction , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed above , we set @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , and take the initial state of the detectors to be separable .    once the interaction is over , in the basis @xmath53 , the partial transpose of the detectors reduced density matrix is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55    @xmath56    using the peres criterion @xcite , we find that the detectors are entangled ( i.e. that the partial transpose has negative eigenvalues ) if @xmath57 physically speaking , this translates to the requirement that the probability of exchange of a right handed virtual particle - anti - particle pair between the detectors be greater than the product of the probabilities for the on - shell emission of a right handed particle - anti - particle pair by the same detector .    for temporally symmetric window functions , a somewhat lengthy calculation shows that the above condition takes on the explicit form ( see appendix for details)@xmath58}\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{a}\\left(\\omega_{a}+\\omega_{1}+\\omega_{2}\\right)\\tilde{\\epsilon}_{b}\\left(\\omega_{b}-\\omega_{1}-\\omega_{2}\\right)\\bigg{|}^{2 } & > \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> this is to be compared with the condition obtained for the massless real klein - gordon field @xcite @xmath61 the two conditions bear similarity . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis performed in @xcite shows that eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3d klein ] ) can be satisfied if we choose @xmath62 such that it oscillates as @xmath63 , _ that is faster than any of its fourier components _ , over a finite integration regime @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , such a choice @xcite can render the exchange probability arbitrarily larger than the product of the emission probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> suppose in our case we take the superoscillatory transform to oscillate like @xmath64 over a suitably chosen integration regime . </S>",
    "<S> then the specially tailored form of the superoscillatory transform guarantees that the first term on the lhs of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3 + 1 condition ] ) is much greater than the rhs . </S>",
    "<S> but for precisely the same reason it is much greater than all other terms on the lhs , and eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ 3 + 1 condition ] ) is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that entanglement persists between arbitrarily far - apart regions of the massless dirac vacuum of quanta of definite handedness , and that the lower bound obtained in @xcite holds here as well . </S>",
    "<S> that is , in the limit @xmath65 the entanglement , quantified by the negativity @xmath66 , scales no faster than @xmath67 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> now as in the duration @xmath50 the detectors probe a spherical region of radius @xmath68 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) , we arrive at the aforementioned lower bound @xmath3 $ ] .     </S>",
    "<S> @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the locations of the detectors . </S>",
    "<S> it is only operators within the two spheres that contribute to the distilled entanglement . ]    not surpirsingly , for the left handed vacuum the condition for entanglement is identical . </S>",
    "<S> this means that double the amount of entanglement can be distilled by coupling to the total charge density , that is the sum of the charge densities of right and left handed quanta .    </S>",
    "<S> before we conclude , there are three questions that need to be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> first , as previously mentioned , an identical bound for the entanglement obtains for the klein - gordon vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the question arises as to whether this reflects some sort of universality or is just an artifact of our distillation protocol @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> naively , it might be expected that the comparatively `` poorer '' structure of the dirac hilbert space , resulting from the anti - commutative nature of the field , leads to a faster decay . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fact that our distillation protocol is perturbative means that in the klein - gordon field case , the hilbert space s full structure does not come into play . </S>",
    "<S> this may very well be the reason for the identical bound , but to say more would be pure speculation .    </S>",
    "<S> second , it is natural to ask whether the correlations giving rise to this entanglement can be attributed to a local hidden - variable model . in the klein - gordon field case , we were able to show @xcite the detector s final state exhibits `` hidden '' nonlocal correlations @xcite , in the sense that after local filtering @xcite an epr state can be distilled . </S>",
    "<S> however , the same does not true here , due to the presence of @xmath69 terms in the reduced density matrix , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dm ] ) , not present in the bosonic equivalent , which prevent the distillation of an epr state . </S>",
    "<S> this question therefore remains open .    </S>",
    "<S> the third question is how the results obtained change in the massive case . </S>",
    "<S> obviously , the presence of a mass term adds another scale to the problem . </S>",
    "<S> from the point of view of our distillation protocol , the dirac equation no longer decouples and it is hard to see how use can be made of a superoscillating function to satisfy the resulting inequalities ( without which we do not know how to distill entanglement at arbitrarily long distances ) . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the fact that the main contribution to the entanglement arises from high frequencies ( see @xcite ) suggests that for a comparatively small mass our results should remain unchanged @xcite . </S>"
