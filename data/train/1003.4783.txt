    "traditionally , quasi - monte carlo ( qmc ) rules are equal weight quadrature formulae defined on @xmath0^s$ ] , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3^s$ ] are quadrature points .",
    "these rules are used to approximate integrals of the form @xmath4^s } f({\\boldsymbol{x } } ) \\ , { \\rm d } { \\boldsymbol{x}},\\ ] ] see @xcite for more information .    in practice , however , the integrals one needs to approximate are usually over domains other than @xmath0^s$ ] , often @xmath1 . in order for qmc rules to be used in this case , one requires a transformation mapping from @xmath1 to @xmath0^s$ ] @xcite .",
    "this step is of great importance , indeed different transformations can yield very different results @xcite .",
    "furthermore , usually known theory does not predict which transformations from @xmath1 to @xmath0^s$ ] will yield the best results  @xcite .    to circumvent this problem",
    ", we introduce quasi - monte carlo type rules for @xmath1 . admittedly , there are still choices to be made by the user of our method .",
    "in fact , one could view the approach proposed here as a discretized transformation , where the transformed point set yields locally qmc rules , but globally has a given distribution .    to understand what properties a point set locally and globally must satisfy , we analyze the worst - case error of numerical integration of functions on @xmath1 with bounded fractional variation of order @xmath5 and which satisfy a decay condition as one moves away from the origin . roughly speaking , if @xmath6 then the functions we consider have square integrable partial mixed derivatives up to order one in each coordinate .",
    "that is , for a partition @xmath7 of @xmath1 into subintervals @xmath8 we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 the value @xmath11 depends on the function as well as the location @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that for @xmath13 we have @xmath14 as @xmath15 with a certain rate of decay .",
    "furthermore , also the function @xmath16 itself must satisfy a certain rate of decay as @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 denotes some norm in @xmath1 ) .    for these functions",
    ", we now construct quadrature rules for which one obtains an integration error bounded above by @xmath19 ( for some @xmath20 depending only on @xmath21 and @xmath5 ) , where @xmath22 denotes the number of quadrature points and @xmath21 the dimension .",
    "the focus in this paper is on the asymptotic convergence rate as @xmath23 .",
    "the study of tractability @xcite is left for future work .",
    "the design of optimal quadrature rules depends on several properties of the functions considered .",
    "one is the smoothness of the functions .",
    "if the function is concentrated on a bounded region , then the quadrature rule should be able to integrate functions with smoothness @xmath5 locally with sufficient accuracy .",
    "in other words , one needs enough flexibility to have optimal quadrature rules locally .",
    "further , since we can only use a finite number of quadrature points @xmath22 , for fixed @xmath22 we can only cover a finite region . here",
    "the assumption of the decay of @xmath16 and the condition on @xmath24 comes in .",
    "it tells us where to concentrate our efforts .",
    "the local property allows us to design quadrature rules which are optimal over subcubes of the form @xmath25 $ ] , the global property tells us how important each of those subcubes is and how their importance is distributed in the space @xmath1 .",
    "for example , assume that @xmath16 and @xmath11 decay at least like @xmath26 as @xmath17 , where @xmath27 .",
    "then the most important subcubes are arranged in a hyperbolic cross around the origin .",
    "below we show how one can map a digital net defined on @xmath0^s$ ] such that in each of the subcubes , inside this hyperbolic cross region , one obtains a digitally shifted digital net , and at the same time , the density of the points in each subcube decreases according to the rate of decay of @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "our approach is flexible enough to also be able to handle other rates of decay of @xmath16 and @xmath11 .",
    "another way to think about this procedure is the following : discretize the transformation from @xmath0^s$ ] to @xmath1 such that a digital net in @xmath0^s$ ] is mapped to several nets in subcubes of @xmath1 , such that the subcubes and number of points therein are distributed according to a given decay rate .",
    "the cost of constructing the point set in @xmath1 is similar to the cost of constructing the underlying digital net over a finite field @xmath28 , assuming that the one - dimensional projections have already been defined . to be more precise , instead of using a mapping @xmath29",
    "as is done for digital nets , one uses a look - up table which defines a mapping @xmath30 .",
    "the cost of constructing the vectors in @xmath31 is the same for digital nets in @xmath32 and in @xmath1 .",
    "the one - dimensional projections on the other hand need to be carefully designed in advance , as we illustrate in section  [ sec_examples_all ] .",
    "since those are designed in advance , we do not count it towards the construction cost of an individual point set .    a numerical test in matlab",
    ", see section  [ sec_numresult ] , reveals that the computation using the method introduced here is considerably faster than using digital nets and the inverse normal cumulative distribution function ( in the numerical example considered here , the proposed method is more than ten times faster ) .",
    "the advantage is that in the proposed method one does not need to compute the inverse normal cumulative distribution function , which can be time consuming .",
    "conceivably one could also create the global property by hand : take a number of digital nets @xmath33 ( for instance from a digital sequence ) , partition @xmath1 into subcubes @xmath34 , and put the digital net @xmath35 in @xmath36 for @xmath37 . in this case ,",
    "the global property is simply designed by hand ( or even adaptively ) .",
    "this method can be become very involved if the dimension @xmath21 is large .",
    "our approach on the other hand builds on a tensor product structure , which simplifies matters , especially in high dimensions . to fit , or nearly fit , the integrand to such a structure it may be advantageous to use the method proposed here in conjunction with some variance reduction method like principal component analysis , brownian bridge constructions or similar methods @xcite .",
    "we give an overview of the paper .",
    "the analysis of the integration error is based on time - frequency analysis . to that end",
    ", we introduce tilings of the walsh phase plane @xcite , which gives us the flexibility to consider subcubes of different size and adjust them to the rate of decay of the function @xmath16 and the variation @xmath11 .",
    "this is done in section  [ sec_walshmodel ] . in section  [ sec_decay_walsh ]",
    "we analyze the rate of decay of the walsh coefficients based on the smoothness of @xmath16 , the rate of decay of @xmath16 , and , roughly speaking , the rate of decay of @xmath11 .    in section  [ sec_num_int ]",
    "we analyze the integration error : we prove an upper bound on the integration error which consists of two parts .",
    "one part deals with the remainder , that is , the region where there are no quadrature points .",
    "for this part one relies on the the rate of decay of @xmath16 to obtain an upper bound .",
    "the other part is concerned with the integration error one commits when using a quadrature rule . for this part",
    "we use estimates of the integration error for qmc rules based on digital nets .",
    "the construction of the quadrature points is introduced in section  [ sec_construction ] .",
    "we show how one can map a digital net in @xmath0^s$ ] into subcubes of @xmath1 such that each subcube contains a digitally shifted digital net , where the size of each digitally shifted digital net is according to a given distribution . in section  [ sec_error_bound ] we give upper bounds on the integration error when one uses the construction of section  [ sec_construction ] .",
    "we show that under certain decay rates of @xmath16 and @xmath11 , the convergence of the integration error is optimal up to some power of @xmath38 . in section  [ sec_examples ]",
    "we provide three concrete examples of how our bounds can be used in a few situations . in section  [ sec_numresult ]",
    "we represent some numerical results which demonstrate the efficiency of the method .    for the convenience of the reader",
