    "i present a completely new semi - classical approach to the quantum liquid theory in terms of true surface properties and geometry of the fermi surface .",
    "within such a description , it can be shown that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the properties of a two - dimensional interacting electron system and its one - dimensional fermi surface .",
    "contrary to popular belief and expectation , i will also prove that the fermi liquid theory corresponds to a rough and not smooth fermi surface .",
    "some of the evidence can be applied to a three - dimensional interacting electron system .",
    "the bulk of the paper is dedicated to the detailed analysis of the rough phase and the corresponding roughening transition . for completeness ,",
    "i present in sections  [ sec : surf ] and [ sec : rough ] the general theory of equilibrium surfaces and the roughening transition .",
    "in addition , the theory of the more particular pokrovsky - talapov transition is presented in the appendix .",
    "this standard surface physics theory is applied to fermi surfaces in section  [ sec : fs ] , while in section  [ sec : facet ] the possible transition between a rough and a flat faceted fermi surface is described . due to the present interest in non - fermi liquid theories",
    ", i will also give a possible scenario in section  [ sec : nonfermi ] when and how such a phase could appear .",
    "the theory of the equilibrium surfaces dates back to the celebrated work of wulff ( wulff 1901 ) and by the time of herring s 1951 paper ( herring 1951 ) the theory was truly understood .",
    "the equilibrium surface shape is the shape that minimizes the total free energy of the surface at a fixed volume .",
    "this constrained minimization was originally solved by wulff , which is an elegant construction and valued textbook material . to find the equilibrium surface shape ,",
    "follow the rules ( wulff 1901 ) : _ i _ ) make a polar plot ( the so - called _ wulff plot _ ) of the surface tension @xmath0 as a function of @xmath1 , _ ii _ ) starting at the origin , draw the radius in direction @xmath2 out to the wulff plot , then _",
    "iii _ ) construct planes perpendicular to @xmath2 s through the intersection of the radius with the wulff plot .",
    "the interior envelope of this family of planes is always a convex figure whose shape is that of the equilibrium surface .    in the following ,",
    "i present the analytic derivation of the equilibrium surface shape based on the landau and andreev derivation ( landau and lifshitz 1980 ) , which is not the most general ( it relies on @xmath3 being piecewise differentiable ) but it has the advantage of being clear and easy to follow .",
    "the disappearance of a cusp , sharp edges , canonical points , etc from the wulff plot are all related to phase transitions . from these",
    ", the most studied is connected to the disappearance of cusps . since the first theoretical attempts by burton and cabrera in 1949",
    "( burton and cabrera 1949 ) , this singularity was usually called the _ roughening transition _ or the phenomena of _ surface melting_. these two denominations refer to the same thermodynamic transition . historically _ roughening transition _ is usually used in the theoretical works where the emphasis is on the critical phenomena aspect of the phases transition , while _ surface melting _ is an approach from the point of view of surface physics and experimentalists .",
    "this may generate some confusion , but everything becomes clear if we follow the argument of burton _ et al . _",
    "( burton and cabrera 1949 ; burton , cabrera and frank 1951 ) outlined in the following : the static properties of a two - dimensional surface are well described by a hamiltonian @xmath26 where the sum runs over all pairs of nearest - neighbour sites . with the simplest choice for the height variables , @xmath27 , eq .",
    "( [ bc - egy ] ) is identical to the two - dimensional ising model ( @xmath28 ) which undergoes a second - order phase transition at @xmath29 , below which @xmath30 and above which @xmath31 . for the surface",
    "this means that above @xmath32 the surface is _ rough _ , as the surface would consist of 50@xmath33 each atoms and holes , but the nucleation barrier for two - dimensional nucleation would vanish , accordingly the surface is _ melted_.      usually , the singularity at this transition is in the same universality class as the kosterlitz - thouless ( 1973 ) transition .",
    "the _ smooth _ interfacial phase maps to the high - temperature , _ exponential _",
    "@xmath45 phase , while the _ rough _ interfacial phase maps to the low - temperature _ algebraic _ ( _ gaussian _ ) @xmath45 phase . or in sine - gordon language , the rough phase maps into a non - interacting , or tomonaga - luttinger model , while the smooth surface into a luther - emery model . however , there are other types of continuous transitions , which can give rise to a rough surface , such as ising , potts , pokrovsky - talapov ( 1978 ) or chiral that are more frequent , depending upon symmetry , number of states , interaction parameters , fields , chirality , etc .",
    "an analysis of the critical behaviour of these transitions is not the purpose of the present work .",
    "such a microscopic approach to the rough surfaces in general and to the fermi surface in particular will be published elsewhere ( gulacsi 1996 ) .",
    "most real crystals grow under conditions that are far from equilibrium .",
    "the application of the present theory for a real surface is limited by the requirement of equilibrium . from this point of view",
    "the fermi surface is an ideal surface as by construction it is in equilibrium .",
    "the fermi liquid picture is both simple and profound . with a few basic assumptions it describes accurately the low - energy , long - wave length behaviour of interacting systems in particular and the thermodynamic properties of the whole system in general .",
    "the theory assumes that there is a one - to - one correspondence between the low - energy excitations of a non - interacting system and the low - energy excitations of the interacting system while preserving the quantum numbers .",
    "that is , if the non - interacting system is characterized by some distribution function @xmath46 of the bare particles , by switching on the interaction adiabatically the eigenstates of the interacting system , called quasiparticles , are also described by same function @xmath46 .",

    "i restrict ourselves to one - dimensional fermi surfaces , @xmath54 denotes the _ local _ height of the surface with slope @xmath55 .",
    "the tilting angle remains @xmath11 .",
    "it is also important to emphasize that the steps are associated with the world lines of fermions ( pokrovsky - talapov 1978 ) . ]",
    "( two - dimensional systems ) .",
    "it should be noted that some formulas or demonstrations that appear in the text are also valid or easily generalized for a two - dimensional fermi surface ( three - dimensional systems ) .",
    "the reader will be prompted when these examples arise .",
    "based on the definitions presented in sections  [ sec : surf ] and [ sec : rough ] it is immediate that eq .",

    "accordingly , the corresponding step free energy , @xmath36 , is strictly zero and by definition the surface is rough .",
    "the roughening transition is defined by the vanishing of the step free energy , and any smooth surface must characterized by eq .",
    "( [ rough - egy ] ) .",
    "the only case where such a simple proof would not work is the case @xmath62 , which would correspond to a half - filled band systems , a case which i will analyze later .",
    "this proof should work equally well for two - dimensional fermi surfaces for the non - interacting case .",
    "however , some problems will appear if we consider the two - dimensional fermi surface , a quantum interface case , which is analyzed in detail by gulacsi ( 1996 ) are very large , so the quantum effects are becoming smaller , accordingly the quantum surface becomes classical before the complete delocalization of the interface . ] .",
    "for a one - dimensional fermi surface , the above argument is based on a nearest - neighbour type effective interaction .",
    "however , at large length scales the discreteness of the step heights is irrelevant , the surface always can be described by a gaussian model , having the properties of a transverse vibrating elastic network . due to this , the obtained transition ( for details see , section  [ sec : facet ] ) is _ not destroyed _ if the interaction between quasiparticles is of short - range type or even has the form @xmath63 with @xmath64 and @xmath65 . from these interactions",
    "the @xmath66 form is the most probable one ( ashcroft and mermin 1976 ) based on a hartree - fock theory , or simply because the elastic or bipolar interactions between steps on an equilibrium surface have this form ( see , section  [ sec : facet ] ) .",
    "the fermi surface is indeed rough for the non - interacting case , and it can be directly proven by the wulff plot .",
    "equations  ( [ surf - egy ] ) through eq .",
    "( [ surf - het ] ) enable one to reconstruct the wulff plot from the equilibrium surface shape .",
    "for an isotropic and non - interacting system with @xmath67 we immediately obtain that @xmath68 becomes independent of @xmath11 , as in the case for an _ ordinary fluid_. accordingly it has no cusps ; that is , the fermi surface is rough . in this simple case , following nozires ( 1991 ) , we can determine the lagrange multiplier of the fermi surface appearing in eqs .",
    "( [ surf - hat ] ) : @xmath69 .    on a lattice",
    "the half - filled and doped case must be treated separately .",
    "namely , for @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , where @xmath72 denotes the hole doping , using eq .",
    "( [ surf - het ] ) , the wulff plot corresponding to the fermi surface @xmath73 will be smooth for @xmath74 and cusped for @xmath62 .",
    "a similar argument used in the previous paragraphs is that @xmath61 and also @xmath75 and for @xmath74 , i.e. , @xmath76 , while for @xmath62 only @xmath77 , so @xmath78 , accordingly the step free energy is finite . in this case , the fermi surface and its wulff plot are identical to fig .  1 ( rotated by @xmath79 ) .",
    "that is , the fermi surface is faceted and the facets are smooth .",
    "however , in this case , the appearance of the facets can be attributed to the presence of the van hove singularity .",
    "the step free energy is finite but small close to the van hove singularity , increasing as we approach the singularity .",
    "this behaviour is caused by the vanishing group velocity , @xmath80 , which explicitly shows up in evaluating eq .",
    "( [ surf - het ] ) .",
    "the step free energy , however , can not grow infinitely large , is bounded by the crystal structure , but produces a facet with the largest possible flat surface , and this is the fermi surface of the half - filled band case .",
    "the above arguments for the half - filled band case are also valid for a two - dimensional fermi surface .    in conclusion , in a non - interacting system the change of the topology of the fermi surface , i.e.",
    "the appearance of flat facets can be attributed to the presence of the van hove singularity . for an interacting case",
    "it is difficult to determine the wulff plot because we do not know the exact form of the self energy , @xmath81 .",
    "however , it can be shown that the fermi liquid picture in general , and eq .",
    "( [ ketto ] ) in particular , is not valid close to half filling .",
    "for example , for the two - dimensional hubbard model , second - order perturbation theory gives for the @xmath82 function ( honner 1995 ) : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the @xmath86 from eq .",
    "( [ harom ] ) is bounded only in the vicinity of @xmath87 with a maximum value of @xmath88 and is divergent as we approach the van hove singularity .",
    "that is , the adiabatic switching on the interaction picture of the fermi liquid theory is no longer valid .    for an interacting electron system ,",
    "the half - filled band case is mostly due to perfect nesting , in the presence of which the fermi surface becomes unstable to the formation of long - range order ( e.g. , charge - density - wave or spin - density - wave ) , or mott insulator , etc .",
    ", due to which a charge or spin gap ( depending on the interactions ) will open .",
    "this causes the divergence of the @xmath53 function . in this case , the fermi surface is not defined in the sense of eq .",
    "( [ egy ] ) or ( [ ketto ] ) . within the present approach , based on the fermi surface geometry",
    ", we can generalize its definition with the understanding that only its topology changes , which means that the fermi surface becomes faceted .",
    "previously , the fermi surface was rounded , while now it has flat , faceted regions .",
    "the presence of a facet would immediately indicate that the fermi surface can not be excited by any small amount of energy .",
    "a minimum energy is required ( the step free energy defined in section  [ sec : surf ] ) to create steps on a flat and smooth facet and this minimum energy signals the presence of a gap in the excitation spectrum . in the next section the width of the facet",
    "is determined , in first approximation , to be proportional to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a mean - field gap and @xmath91 is the non - interacting fermi velocity .",
    "accordingly , the appearance of these facets on the fermi surface is equivalent to an instability of the fermi surface by which a condensate will emerge in the interacting electron system .",
    "the presence of facets in a two - dimensional fermi surface will equally mean an instability of the fermi surface towards a quasiparticle gap opening .",
    "the half - filled band analyzed in the previous section is a particular case where all the fermi surface is flat .",
    "generally , facets appear on a surface gradually , meaning their width increases with variation of some parameters ( doping , external magnetic or electric field ) or temperature . in any case",
    ", the appearance of facets on the fermi surface will always lead to nesting ( due to the symmetries of the brillouin zone ) usually a partial one . as the surface of the facets increases ,",
    "nesting becomes stronger and stronger until it reaches a completely nested fermi surface similar to the half - filled band case .",
    "the transition from the rough surface into a faceted one , is a roughening transition by which the topology of the fermi surface changes completely , and the properties of which are determined in the following .",
    "the surface free energy of a facet is given in eq .",
    "( [ rough - egy ] ) .",
    "however , this term represents only non - interacting steps . to describe properly the faceting transition we need the knowledge of the interactions between the steps present on the surface .",
    "as the present discussion is a phenomenological one , we do not intend to subtract these interactions from perturbation theories but rather to analyze them from a surface physics point of view .",
    "there are several main sources of interaction on a surface .",
    "the first is the fact that we do not allow steps to cross , or create overhangs , as these states would require higher energy .",
    "meaning , the steps will be restricted resulting in an entropic interaction .",
    "the contribution of such an entropic repulsion , we can understand by following gruber and mullins ( 1967 ) : let us suppose for a moment that a single step is constrained to move between two walls situated at @xmath92 .",
    "the presence of the walls produces an entropic repulsion between the wall and step .",
    "the probability density @xmath93 for the step passing true @xmath94 is ( gruber and mullins 1967 ) : @xmath95 and the free energy of the step becomes would be a constant , than the step staying away from the walls would decrease its entropy and thereby its free energy with @xmath96 . ] : @xmath97 .",
    "now , replacing the fixed boundaries of the walls by neighbouring steps results in : @xmath98 , which introduced in eq .",
    "( [ rough - egy ] ) will give an @xmath99 contribution .",
    "short - range interactions ( jayaprakash , rottman and saam 1984 ) can not alter this behaviour . namely , in a mean - field theory the contribution of a short - range interaction @xmath100 will be @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the non - interacting pair correlation function , @xmath103 / [ \\pi k_x h ( k_x ) / l]^2 \\ } $ ] .",
    "if @xmath104 is smaller than the distance between steps or the step width limit can be related ( balibar , guthmann and rolley 1993 ) to the so - called _ pinning _ or _ coupling strength _ of an effective sine - gordon model , accordingly the steps are relatively wide . ] , @xmath102 may be expanded and the contribution of a short - range interaction will be of order @xmath105 .      at this point , it is important to emphasize the following : _ i _ ) all type of interactions on a surface are giving a contribution of @xmath112 in the expression of the surface free energy .",
    "naively , one might expect the free energy due to interactions to be of the @xmath59 order , however it is not .",
    "a contribution of the @xmath59 type occurs only in a rough surface , see eq .",

    "( [ facet - harom ] ) is crucial for the faceting transition .",

    "i determine the interface profile .",
    "continuing the arguments from section  [ sec : rough ] , when @xmath108 crosses zero , the horizontal width of the facet , @xmath114 , jumps from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , that is the facet width will be proportional to @xmath117 . in a mean - field approach",
    "the spectrum has the @xmath118 form . using the continuum result from section  [ sec : fs ] for the lagrange multiplier : @xmath119 , in first approximation it is obtained that the fermi surface facet width is proportional to @xmath120 . in section  [ sec : nonfermi ]",
    "it will be shown that the facet width is inverse proprotional to the effective correlation length on the surface : @xmath121 .",
    "the interface profile near the edges of a facet will have a universal shape .",

    "that is , @xmath125 this equation establishes a universal ( non - analytic ) jump of the curvature , well - known in surface physics .",
    "the @xmath126 exponent is the pokrovsky - talapov ( 1978 ) exponent while the transition is called the gruber - mullins ( 1967 ) or the pokrovsky - talapov transition . the above description of the pokrovsky - talapov transition is mainly based on an effective nearest - neighbour model , however , as previously demonstrated , the pokrovsky - talapov exponent and correspondingly the transition is not destroyed by short - range interactions and not even by long - range interactions .",
    "the effects of the long - range interactions are analyzed in more detail the following section , where it will be seen that the roughening transition remains unchanged , only a new phase may appear .",
    "other characteristics of the roughening transition can be re - written for the fermi surface , e.g. , the universal jump in the curvature of the fermi surface before and after the transition , or it can be shown that near the edge of the facets on the rough curved surfaces the steps are spontaneously generated with a square root density .",
    "as presented in the appendix , a pokrovsky - talapov transition appears by varying the a doping , or external magnetic or electric fields . as a function of temperature ,",
    "however , such a transition is a kosterlitz - thouless transition if the width of the facet vanishes at the transition , otherwise is a standard second - order phase transition .",
    "the conclusions from the previous sections were that the rough phase of the fermi surface corresponds to the metallic ( fermi liquid ) state of a system , while a faceting ( pokrovsky - talapov type ) transition will lead to an instability of the fermi surface corresponding to the appearance of some kind of condensate . in both cases ,",
    "the surface may be characterized by the density ( occupation probability ) distribution @xmath127 , where @xmath128 was defined in eq .",
    "( [ egy ] ) .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : surf ] , in the rough phase the density - density correlation function has an algebraic decay but an exponential decay for the smooth faceted phase .",
    "it is important to emphasize that these correlation functions appear in both translational and orientational order of the surface , which are decoupled ( haldane 1994 ) , with the understanding that the orientational fluctuations can not change the shape of the surface .      the faceted phase on the other hand , maps into a luther - emery phase : @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the effective correlation length on the surface and @xmath90 the quasiparticle gap .",

    "i.e. in the @xmath135 direction , the situation is not so simple and detailed microscopic calculations are needed ( gulacsi 1996 ) .",

    "the exact solutions of nearest - neighbour interacting lattice models , or surface models , exhibits three phases ( see , appendix ) .",
    "first , one which is ferroelectric , corresponding to a completely _ locked _ ( or frozen ) solid surface , corresponding to a ferromagnetic type transition , i.e. , a pomeranchuk ( 1958 ) type instability of the fermi surface . the second , disordered phase and the third , ordered phase corresponds to the rough and flat ( faceted ) surfaces , respectively . in this context , one of the most appealing possibilities to generate a liquid state , that is a metallic phase , but not a fermi liquid",
    ", would be a phase between the rough and flat surfaces , _ which shares the properties of both_. that is , a new phase between these two such that the new surface would be characterized by an exponential decay of the translational order but an algebraic decay of the correlation function of the orientational order .",
    "the existence of such a surface ( sometimes called a hexatic fluid ) is still controversial in the surface community ( bauer 1987 ) , however , it would correspond to the disordered flat surface introduced by den nijs ( 1989 ) which is in a pre - roughening state , corresponding to the presence of a `` haldane gap '' type gap .",
    "being so , it has what we could call _ hidden _ topological order .",
    "the appearance of such a phase is due to short - range interactions ( nijs , den 1989 ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "facet ] , i have shown that next - nearest - neighbour or short - range interactions can not disturb or change the pokrovsky - talapov melting transition . however , what they can do , is to generate the above introduced disordered flat surface ( nijs , den 1989 ) .",
    "an algebraic decay of the orientational order , means that @xmath140 will have some singularity as we cross @xmath141 , and the surface would correspond to a metallic phase .",
    "however , the metallic phase is not a fermi liquid because the translational order is gapped .",
    "the step free energy is zero in such a non - fermi liquid phase ( nijs , den 1989 ) , so based on the definitions introduced in section  [ sec : rough ] the surface is `` rough '' , but the height - height correlations are not divergent and thus the reason why such a phase is refered to as pre - roughening phase .",
    "concerning the translational order , which is gapped , the surface exhibits flat surface facets similar to the previously analyzed faceted phase .",
    "the main difference is that , in the later phase the facets have a well - defined macroscopical width ( see , section  [ sec : rough ] ) , while in a pre - rough phase only the _ average _ surface is flat .",
    "the surface structure is characterized by perfect antiferromagnetic order of the heights @xmath108 at random positions @xmath114 .",

    "the lagrangian is : @xmath150 , with @xmath151 and @xmath152 .",
    "we can identify this with the six - vertex model ( see , appendix ) in the following way : in the eight - vertex model ( baxter 1990 ) the magnetic charge attached to the vertices seven and eight is @xmath153 , due to which the scaling dimension of a vortex operator is @xmath154 and , accordingly , the scaling dimension of its corresponding fugacity is @xmath155 . if the boltzmann weights of vertices seven and eight are vanishingly small , the free energy is singular with an exponent inverse proportional to the fugacity which identified with the singular behaviour obtained by baxter ( baxter 1990 ) gives : @xmath156 , where @xmath157 is the anisotropy parameter of the model ( see , appendix ) .",
    "thus , the translation fluctuations of the fermi surface will have a ground - state corresponding to that of the planar six - vertex model ( baxter 1990 ) : @xmath158 with low lying states forming a particle - hole continuum bounded by @xmath159 thus , not only bosons corresponding to zero sound will appear on the fermi surface but also a particle - hole continuum .",
    "i would like to thank p. w. anderson , k. s. bedell , a. r. bishop , d. coffey , j. engelbrecht , f. d. m. haldane , d. scalapino and s. trugman for many useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the australian research council .",
    "in the past twenty years , incommensurate periodicities have been observed in many physical systems and have become the subject of considerable theoretical interest .",
    "two incommensurate structures in contact can overcome their rigidity and form a common periodicity .",
    "this transition is known as the commensurate - incommensurate , or lock - in transition .    since its discovery in the context with dislocation theory ( frank and merwe , van der 1949 )",
    ", the commensurate - incommensurate transition had a major role ( for a review , see bak 1982 ; or nijs , den 1988 ) in understanding the physics of charge - density - waves , incommensurate lattice problems , the general problem of incommensurate periodicities , two - dimensional ( xy ) models , theory of phase transitions in magnetic systems and 1d quantum systems , and the correlation driven metal insulator ( mott ) transition ( gulacsi and bedell 1994b ) .    in most of the systems and models mentioned above , the problem of characterizing the commensurate - incommensurate transition has been reduced to the solution of the 1d sine - gordon model .",
    "the level of incommensurability is measured by a soliton density , @xmath160 , where @xmath56 is the chemical potential .",
    "the commensurate - incommensurate transition happens at @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the single soliton energy . for @xmath163 and @xmath164",
    "the system is locked in a commensurate phase , while for @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath166 the structure is incommensurate .    in the classical limit",
    "the commensurate - incommensurate transition occurs with the emergence of a soliton lattice in the soliton gap ( frank and merwe , van der 1949 ; and horowitz , 1982 ) . at low soliton density ,",
    "the solitons repel each other , with an exponential type interaction ( horowitz 1982 ) , and the transition takes place with a logarithmic behavior @xmath167 , i.e. , corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath168 . in the full quantum problem , it is known ( haldane 1982 ) , that the soliton lattice will melt , giving rise to a luttinger liquid which emerges at the top or bottom of the soliton gap . in this case the solitons will repel each other much stronger than in the classical limit , with an interaction proportional to @xmath169 , in the low soliton density limit .",
    "the incommensurability close to the transition behaves as @xmath170 , where @xmath90 is the soliton gap , corresponding to a critical exponent @xmath171 .",
    "this is the pokrovsky - talapov exponent ( pokrovsky and talapov 1978 ) . in some applications",
    "this transition is characterized with the variation of the thermodynamic potential , @xmath172 , for which we obtain @xmath173 . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the relevant quantity to observe this transition is the charge susceptibility , @xmath174 , which is divergent at the transition @xmath175 .",
    "this divergent behavior implies a divergence of the effective mass of the charge carriers , and accordingly the divergence of the specific heat coefficient .",
    "thus , the basic characteristics of the pokrovsky - talapov transition are : @xmath176 or , as a function of the soliton density ( incommensurability ) are : @xmath177    the pokrovsky - talapov transition , however , is typical for all integrable models . its importance in connection to the 2d xy , gaussian , coulomb - gas models but , most important to the equivalent ( chui and weeks 1976 ; beijeren , van , 1977 ; and jayaprakash and saam 1984 ) solid - on - solid surface models led a to thorough analysis of its properties . recognizing ( nijs , den 1981 ; and b. horowitz , bohr , kosterlitz and schulz 1983 ) the equivalence between the gaussian models and the direct field six - vertex model ( defined below ) led to the remarkable result that the six - vertex model in a direct field is an ideal model to describe the commensurate - incommensurate transition .",
    "the direct field in the six - vertex model correspond to the chemical potential in eqs .",
    "( [ app - egy ] ) and ( [ app - ketto ] ) , while the polarization of the six - vertex model is equivalent to the soliton density , @xmath178 .",
    "the five- and six - vertex models are the simplest , exactly solvable model describing surface transitions . in general , the vertex models define a statistical mechanics on a ( for simplicity ) square lattice as follows . on each link",
    "there is a degree of freedom taking two values which is represented ( traditionally ) by an arrow , i.e. @xmath179 and @xmath180 . to each vector therefore there corresponds 16 possible configurations .",
    "to each of these we associate a boltzmann weight @xmath181 .",
    "this general model is referred to as the sixteen - vertex model .",
    "the exact solution of this general ferroelectric model is not known .",
    "if we choose the boltzmann weights , so that six vertices with two entering and two exiting arrows ( or eight vertices including also the cases where four or zero arrows exit ) have finite weight , then we define the six- or eight - vertex models .",
    "the six - vertex model is exactly solvable via the algebraic bethe ansatz , for details see lieb and wu ( lieb and wu 1972 ) and baxter ( baxter 1990 ) .",
    "the exact solution has at most four independent variables ( this is because the zero energy can be chosen arbitrary and the ice rule implies @xmath182 ) .",
    "in this situation the model is called the asymmetric six - vertex model , in contrast to the symmetric six - vertex model , where the number of independent variables are two .",
    "the symmetric model in the presence of @xmath183 and @xmath184 external fields is equivalent to the asymmetric one .",
    "the energies of the six possible arrow configurations of the symmetric model are @xmath185 , @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "similarly , the field - free five - vertex model is defined by three independent boltzmann weights , e.g. , @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 and @xmath187 and its exact solution can be determined via the algebraic bethe ansatz ( gulacsi , beijeren , van and levi 1993 ) .    * 1 . ) *   for the six - vertex model , the exact free energy obtained with the algebraic bethe ansatz ( lieb and wu 1972 ; and baxter 1990 ) exhibits three different analytic forms for the three different phases , i.e. , two frozen - in ferroelectric phases ( with the polarization , @xmath191 ) , an antiferroelectric phase ( @xmath192 ) and a disordered phase ( paraelectric , @xmath192 ) . the transitions to the ferroelectric phases is of first - order , while the transition from the paraelectric phase to the antiferroelectric one is of kosterlitz - thouless type .    introducing a vertical field , @xmath184 in the symmetric model",
    "is still easily solvable with the algebraic bethe ansatz .",
    "all the above mentioned transitions are _ second - order _ now , as a function of temperature and pokrovsky - talapov as function of the external field .",

    "the exact free energy is obtained as @xmath194 = @xmath195 .",
    "all the three transitions are similar in nature , accordingly we describe only the antiferroelectric one , @xmath196 .",
    "the free energy in the ordered phase ( smooth faceted surface ) is determined by ( eq .  ( 304 ) from lieb and wu 1972 ) : @xmath197 with @xmath198 , i.e. , there is no second - order contribution .",

    "( [ app - ketto ] ) can be interpreted as follows : the linear term in @xmath178 sums up the energy contributions of the non - interacting quasiparticles ( solitons , holons , surface steps , etc . , depending on the model under consideration ) .",
    "the missing quadratic term in @xmath178 shows that there is no effective _ attraction _ between the quasiparticles ( see below ) and the @xmath217 term suggests of the presence of strong repulsion .",
