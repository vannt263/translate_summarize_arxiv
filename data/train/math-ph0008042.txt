    "there are two principal ways to guarantee the unicity of solution of a not homogeneous differential equation of mathematical physics in the whole space .",
    "the first is the famous limiting absorption principle which in the case of some operators , for example the helmholtz operator , has a very natural physical meaning reflected in its name ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . the medium is assumed to be slightly absorbent with a corresponding absorption parameter @xmath0 for @xmath1 the inhomogeneous equation ( under some additional natural conditions ) has a unique solution @xmath2 decreasing at infinity , and the solution for @xmath3 is obtained as the limit of @xmath2 when @xmath4 this approach , based on a deep understanding of the physical nature of the differential operator , is not applicable in all cases .",
    "another approach is to impose a radiation condition at infinity which `` prohibits '' the existence of some unwanted solutions .",
    "such a prohibition is related to the unicity of an integral representation for null - solutions of the differential operator . in the case of the helmholtz operator",
    "the corresponding radiation condition was introduced by a. sommerfeld @xcite .",
    "for the maxwell equations such condition was proposed by c. mller @xcite and s. silver @xcite .",
    "recently , a. mcintosh and m. mitrea in @xcite introduced a radiation condition for a special perturbed clifford - dirac operator .",
    "we use their approach to obtain a radiation condition for the operator @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the moisil - theodoresco operator and @xmath7 is the operator of multiplication by a complex quaternion @xmath8 from the right - hand side ( for exact definitions see section 2 ) . then using a simple matrix transformation proposed in @xcite , which converts the operator @xmath5 into the dirac operator in its traditional form through the @xmath9-matrices , we rewrite the radiation condition for the dirac spinors in a form suitable for applications and obtain an integral representation for null - solutions of the classical dirac operator in unbounded domains , based on the proposed radiation condition .",
