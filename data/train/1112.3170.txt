    "the study of cold atomic gases has recently shed new light on several aspects of quantum many - body physics @xcite .",
    "most of the measurements in this field of research are based on the determination of the spatial density of the gas @xcite .",
    "for instance one can use the _ in situ _ steady - state atomic distribution in a trapping potential to infer the equation of state of the homogenous gas @xcite .",
    "another example is the time - of - flight method , in which one measures the spatial density after switching off the trapping potential and allowing for a certain time of ballistic expansion .",
    "this gives access to the momentum distribution of the gas , and to the conversion of interaction energy into kinetic energy at the moment of the potential switch - off .    to access the atomic density @xmath0 ,",
    "one usually relies on the interaction of the atoms with quasi - resonant laser light .",
    "the most common method is absorption imaging , in which the shadow imprinted by the cloud on a low intensity probe beam is imaged on a camera .",
    "the simplest modelling of absorption imaging is based on a mean - field approach , in which one assumes that the local value of the electric field driving an atomic dipole at a given location depends only on the average density of scatterers .",
    "one can then relate the attenuation of the laser beam to the column atomic density @xmath1 along the line - of - sight @xmath2 .",
    "the optical density of the cloud @xmath3 $ ] is given by the beer  lambert law @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the photon scattering cross - section , and @xmath6 ( resp .",
    "@xmath7 ) are the incoming ( resp .",
    "outgoing ) intensity of the probe laser in the plane @xmath8 perpendicular to the propagation axis . for a closed two - level atomic transition of frequency @xmath9",
    ", @xmath5 depends on the wavelength @xmath10 associated to this transition and on the detuning @xmath11 between the probe light frequency @xmath12 and the atomic frequency : @xmath13 here @xmath14 represents the natural line width of the transition ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath15 is the natural life time of the excited state of the transition ) .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0 ] ) assumes that the intensity of the probe beam is much lower than the saturation intensity of the atomic transition .",
    "quasi - resonant absorption imaging is widely used to measure the spatial distribution of atomic gases after a long time - of - flight , when the density has dropped sufficiently so that the mean - field approximation leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive_absorption ] ) is valid .",
    "one can also use absorption imaging to probe _ in situ _",
    "samples , at least in the case where @xmath16 is not very large so that the output intensity is not vanishingly small .",
    "this is in particular the case for low dimensional gases .",
    "consider for example a 2d gas , such that the translational degree of freedom along @xmath2 has been frozen .",
    "for a probe beam propagating along this axis , one can transpose the beer  lambert law of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive_absorption ] ) by simply replacing the column density by the surface density @xmath17 of the gas .",
    "this 2d beer  lambert law can be heuristically justified by treating each atom as a disk of area @xmath5 that blocks every photon incident on it . in an area @xmath18 containing",
    "@xmath19 randomly placed atoms , the probability that a photon is not blocked by any of the disks is @xmath20 .    in a quasi-2d gas",
    "there is however an important limitation on the optical densities to which one may apply the beer - lambert prediction of eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive_absorption ] ) .",
    "already for @xmath21 the mean interparticle distance is only @xmath22 and one may expect that the optical response of an atom strongly depends on the precise location of its neighbours .",
    "more precisely the exchange of photons between closely spaced atoms induces a resonant van der waals interaction that significantly shifts the atomic resonance frequency with respect to its bare value @xmath23 .",
    "the optical density of the gas at resonance may then be reduced with respect to eq .",
    "( [ eq : naive_absorption ] ) , and this was indeed observed in a series of experiments performed with a degenerate @xmath24rb gas @xcite .",
    "the general subject of the propagation of a light wave in a dense atomic sample , where multiple scattering plays an essential role , has been the subject of numerous experimental and theoretical works ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite in the context of cold atoms , and @xcite for a review ) . here",
    "we present a quantitative treatment of the collective effects that appear when a weak probe beam interacts with a quasi-2d atomic gas .",
    "we consider an ensemble of @xmath25 atoms at rest with random positions and we investigate the transmission of quasi - resonant light by the atom sheet .",
    "we model the resonance transition between the atomic ground ( @xmath26 ) and excited ( @xmath27 ) states by a @xmath28 transition .",
    "we present two equivalent approaches ; the first one is based on the calculation of the field radiated by an assembly of @xmath25 dipoles , where each dipole is driven by an external field plus the field radiated by the @xmath29 other dipoles ; the second one uses the standard @xmath30 matrix formalism of scattering theory .",
    "we show that in both cases the optical density of the medium can be determined by solving the same @xmath31 linear system .",
    "a similar formalism has been previously used for the study of light propagation in small 3d atomic samples , in the presence of multiple scattering ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "however its application to quasi-2d samples has ( to our knowledge ) not yet been investigated , except in the context of anderson localisation of light @xcite .",
    "our numerical calculations are performed for @xmath32atoms , which is sufficient to reach the ` thermodynamic limit ' for the range of parameters that is relevant for experiments .",
    "we show in particular that even for moderate values of @xmath33 , the optical density is notably reduced compared to what is expected from the beer - lambert law ( _ e.g. _ , more than @xmath34 reduction for @xmath35 ) .",
    "we investigate how the absorption line shape is modified by the resonant van der waals interactions and we also show how the result ( [ eq : naive_absorption ] ) is recovered when one increases the thickness of the gas , for a given column density @xmath36 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : modelling ] , we detail the modelling of the atom - light interaction with the two - level and rotating wave approximations .",
    "then we explain the principle of the calculation for the absorption of a weak probe beam crossing the atom slab ( section [ sec : absorption_calculation ] ) .",
    "the ensemble of our numerical results are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally in section [ sec : summary ] we discuss some limitations to our model and draw some concluding remarks .",
    "we use the standard description of the quantised electromagnetic field in the coulomb gauge @xcite , and choose periodic boundary conditions in the cubic - shaped quantisation volume @xmath37 .",
    "we denote @xmath38 the destruction operator of a photon with wave vector @xmath39 and polarisation @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the quantised field is @xmath42 and the transverse electric field operator reads @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the wave vectors @xmath39 are quantised in the volume @xmath46 as @xmath47 , @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is a positive or negative integer .",
    "we consider a collection of @xmath25 identical atoms at rest in positions @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we model the atomic resonance transition by a two - level system with a ground state @xmath52 with angular momentum @xmath53 and an excited level of angular momentum @xmath54 .",
    "we choose as a basis set for the excited manifold the three zeeman sublevels @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath55 is the eigenstate with eigenvalue 0 of the component @xmath57 of the atomic angular momentum operator .",
    "we denote @xmath58 the energy difference between @xmath27 and @xmath26 .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian is thus ( up to a constant ) @xmath59    the restriction to a two - level approximation is legitimate if the detuning @xmath60 between the probe and the atomic frequencies is much smaller than @xmath23 .",
    "the modelling of this transition by a @xmath61 transition leads to a relatively simple algebra .",
    "the transitions that are used for absorption imaging in real experiments often involve more zeeman states ( @xmath62 for rb atoms in @xcite ) , but are more complex to handle @xcite and they are thus out of the scope of this paper .",
    "however we believe that the most salient features of multiple scattering and resonant van der waals interactions are captured by our simple level scheme .",
    "we treat the atom - light interaction using the electric dipole approximation ( length gauge ) , which is legitimate since the resonance wavelength of the atoms @xmath63 is much larger than the atomic size .",
    "we write the atom - light coupling as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dipole operator for the atom @xmath66 .",
    "we will use the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , which consists in keeping only the resonant terms in the coupling : @xmath67 where h.c .",
    "stands for hermitian conjugate . here",
    "@xmath68 represents the raising part of the dipole operator for atom @xmath66 : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the electric dipole associated to the @xmath71 transition and @xmath72 is a unit vector in the direction @xmath73 .",
    "when a single atom is coupled to the electromagnetic field , this coupling results in the modification of the resonance frequency ( lamb shift ) and in the fact that the excited state @xmath27 acquires a non - zero width @xmath14 @xmath74 for simplicity we will incorporate the lamb shift in the definition of @xmath23 .",
    "note that the proper calculation for this shift requires that one goes beyond the two - level and the rotating wave approximations .",
    "the linewidth @xmath14 on the other hand can be calculated from the above expressions for @xmath75 using the fermi golden rule .",
    "the rwa provides a very significant simplification of the treatment of the atom - light coupling , in the sense that the total number of excitations is a conserved quantity .",
    "the annihilation ( resp . creation ) of a photon is always associated with the transition of one of the @xmath25 atoms from @xmath26 to @xmath27 ( resp . from @xmath27 to @xmath26 ) .",
    "this would not be the case if the non - resonant terms of the electric dipole coupling @xmath76 and @xmath77 were also taken into account .",
    "the small parameter associated to the rwa is @xmath78 , which is in practice in the range @xmath79 ; the rwa is thus an excellent approximation .",
    "formally the use of the electric dipole interaction implies to add to the hamiltonian an additional contact term between the dipoles ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "this term will play no role in our numerical simulations because we will surround the position of each atom by a small excluded volume , which mimics the short range repulsive interaction between atoms .",
    "we checked that the results of our numerical calculations ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] ) do not depend on the size of the excluded volume , and we can safely omit the additional contact term in the present work .",
    "we present in this section the general formalism that allows one to calculate the absorption of a quasi - resonant laser beam by a slab of @xmath25 atoms .",
    "we address this question using two different approaches .",
    "the first one maps the problem onto the collective behaviour of an assembly of @xmath25 oscillating dipoles @xcite .",
    "the equation of motion for each dipole is obtained using the heisenberg picture for the hamiltonian presented in section [ sec : modelling ] .",
    "it contains two driving terms , one from the incident probe field and one from the field radiated by all the other dipoles at the location of the dipole under study .",
    "the steady - state of this assembly of dipoles is obtained by solving a set of @xmath80 linear equations .",
    "the second approach uses the standard quantum scattering theory @xcite , which is well suited for perturbative calculations and partial resummations of diagrams .",
    "we suppose that one photon is incident on the atomic medium and we use resummation techniques to take into account the multiple scattering events that can occur before the photon emerges from the medium .",
    "the relevant quantity in this approach is the probability amplitude @xmath81 that the outgoing photon is detected in the same mode as the incident one @xcite , and we show that @xmath81 is obtained from the same set of equations as the values of the dipoles in the first approach .      in this section",
    "we assume that the incident field is prepared in a coherent state corresponding to a monochromatic plane wave @xmath82 .",
    "we choose the polarization @xmath83 to be linear and parallel to the @xmath84 axis ( @xmath85 ) .",
    "since we consider a @xmath28 transition , this choice does not play a significant role and we checked that we recover essentially the same results with a circular polarisation .",
    "note that the situation would be different for an atomic transition with larger @xmath86 and @xmath87 since optical pumping processes would then depend crucially on the polarisation of the probe laser .    the amplitude @xmath88 is supposed to be small enough that the steady - state populations of the excited states @xmath89 are small compared to unity .",
    "this ensures that the response of each atomic dipole is linear in @xmath88 ; this approximation is valid when the rabi frequency @xmath90 is small compared to the natural width @xmath14 or the detuning @xmath60 .    using the atom - light coupling ( [ eq : atom_light_coupling0 ] ) , the equations of motion for the annihilation operators @xmath38 in the heisenberg picture read : @xmath91 this equation can be integrated between the initial time @xmath92 and the time @xmath93 , and the result can be injected in the expression for the transverse field to provide its value at any point @xmath94 : @xmath95\\ , \\label{eq : field_heisenberg}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 stands for the value obtained in the absence of atoms .",
    "we now take the quantum average of this set of equations . in the steady - state regime",
    "the expectation value of the dipole operator @xmath97 can be written @xmath98 , and the average of @xmath99 is the incident field @xmath100  .",
    "we denote the average value of the transverse field operator in @xmath94 as @xmath101 , and we obtain after some algebra ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) @xmath102 where we set @xmath103 ( with @xmath104 ) , @xmath105 and @xmath106 the function @xmath107 is identical to the one appearing in classical electrodynamics @xcite , when calculating the field radiated in @xmath94 by a dipole located at the origin .",
    "we proceed similarly for the equations of motion for the dipole operators @xmath108 and take their average value in steady - state .",

    "the comparison of the results obtained for @xmath262 and @xmath309 suggests that the blue shift of the resonance line , which is present in both cases , is a many - body phenomenon , whereas the large amplitude wings with a blue - red asymmetry , which occurs only for @xmath262 , is rather an effect of close pairs .",
    "this asymmetry in the wings of the absorption line in a 2d gas can actually be understood in a semi - quantitative manner by a simple reasoning .",
    "we recall that for two atoms at a distance @xmath315 , the levels involving one ground and one excited atom have an energy ( real part of the eigenvalues of @xmath187 ) that is displaced by @xmath316 .",
    "a given detuning @xmath308 can thus be associated to a distance @xmath209 between the two members of a pair that will resonantly absorb the light . to be more specific",
    "let us consider a pair of atoms with @xmath317 , and suppose for simplicity that it is aligned either along the polarization axis of the light ( @xmath84 ) or perpendicularly to the axis ( @xmath318 ) . in both cases",
    "the excited state of the pair that is coupled to the laser is the symmetric combination @xmath319 .",
    "if the pair is aligned along the @xmath84 axis , this state has an energy @xmath320 , hence it is resonant with red detuned light such that @xmath321 .",
    "if the pair axis is perpendicular to @xmath84 , the state written above has an energy @xmath322 , hence it is resonant with blue detuned light such that @xmath323 .",
    "this clearly leads to an asymmetry between red and blue detuning ; indeed the pair distance @xmath209 needed for ensuring resonance for a given @xmath324 , @xmath325 , is smaller than the value @xmath326 for the opposite value @xmath327 .",
    "since the probability density for the pair distance is @xmath328 in 2d for randomly drawn positions , we expect the absorption signal to be stronger for @xmath327 than for @xmath329 . in a 3d geometry",
    "the variation of the probability density with @xmath209 is even stronger ( @xmath330 ) , but it is compensated by the fact that the probability of occurrence of pairs that are resonant with blue detuned light is dimensionally increased .",
    "for example in our simplified modelling where the pair axis is aligned with the references axes , a given pair will be resonant with blue detuned light in 2/3 of the cases ( axis along @xmath318 or @xmath2 ) and resonant with red detuned light only in 1/3 of the cases ( axis along @xmath84 ) .",
    "this explains why the asymmetry of the absorption profile is much reduced for a 3d gas in comparison to the 2d case .",
    "we have presented in this paper a detailed analysis of the scattering of light by a disordered distribution of atoms in a quasi - two dimensional geometry .",
    "the particles were treated as fixed scatterers and their internal structure was modeled as a two - level system , with a @xmath331 ground state and a @xmath332 excited state . in spite of these simplifying assumptions the general trend of our results is in good agreement with the experimental finding of @xcite , where a variation of the measured optical density similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : od_odnaive ] was measured .",
    "several improvements in our modeling can be considered in order to reach a quantitative agreement with theory and experiment .",
    "the first one is to include the relatively complex atomic structure of the alkali - metal species used in practice , with a multiply degenerate ground state ; this could be done following the lines of @xcite .",
    "a second improvement consists in taking into account the atomic motion .",
    "this is in principle a formidable task , because it leads to a spectacular increase in the dimension of the relevant hilbert space .",
    "this addition can however be performed in practice in some limiting cases , for example if one assumes that the particles are tightly bound in a lattice @xcite . when the atom - light interaction is used only to probe the spatial atomic distribution of the gas , neglecting the particle motion",
    "should not be a major problem .",
    "indeed the duration of the light pulse is quite short ( @xmath333 microseconds only ) .",
    "each atom scatters only a few photons in this time interval and its displacement is then smaller than the mean interatomic spacing for the spatial densities encountered in practice .",
    "the acceleration of the atoms under the effect of resonant van der waals interaction should also have a minor effect under relevant experimental conditions .",
    "finally another aspect that could be valuably studied is the interaction of the gas with an intense laser beam @xcite .",
