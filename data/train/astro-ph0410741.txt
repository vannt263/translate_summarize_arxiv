    "thousands of cosmic rays with energies higher than @xmath0  ev have been detected by various experiments .",
    "still , the origin of these energetic particles remains unknown .",
    "deflections of charged particles by cosmic magnetic fields are relatively small ( though significant ) at these energies ; moreover , presence of a fraction of neutral particles , which propagate rectilinearly , is not excluded .",
    "this opens a possibility for direct searches of astrophysical sources of the high - energy cosmic rays by positional correlations .",
    "several difficulties limit the application of this approach .",
    "firstly , at least a large fraction of air showers with @xmath1  ev is believed to be caused by protons , whose trajectories are bend by cosmic magnetic fields by several degrees .",
    "lack of knowledge about these fields makes it difficult to account for the deflections while at highest energies , where the deflections are believed to be small , low statistics of the cosmic rays prevents one from making definite conclusions .",
    "secondly , the angular resolution of the cosmic - ray experiments is very poor by the astronomical standards .",
    "the most precise ground array , agasa , has an average error of @xmath2 in determination of the arrival directions at the highest observed energies , and @xmath3 at @xmath4  ev  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "an impressive number of astrophysical objects fall in the error box of each particular cosmic ray .",
    "the situation improved with the availability of the first set of the hires stereo data  @xcite with claimed angular resolution of @xmath5 .",
    "still , this resolution is quite poor for direct identification : dozens of optical , radio and x - ray sources are contained in a given circle of @xmath5 radius on the celestial sphere .    with these complications ,",
    "statistical methods give the only possible clue to search for positional correlations between the cosmic rays and their potential sources .",
    "an excess of cosmic rays at small angular distances ( in particular , at those compared to the experiment s angular resolution ) from objects of a certain class may suggest that this class of objects contains more probably the sources of these cosmic rays than other classes , which do not exhibit such an excess .",
    "many astrophysical sites have been suggested which can host an accelerator powerful enough to produce particles with @xmath6  ev and higher .",
    "most of them are extragalactic ( which is consistent with the lack of global galactic anisotropy of the arrival directions of high - energy cosmic rays ) .",
    "various cosmic accelerators may operate by similar mechanisms , so the most efficient way to distinguish between them is based on direct positional correlations . up to now , the correlations with different classes of objects were studied by different methods , with different data sets , or were not studied at all .",
    "this work aims at filling this gap and calculating the chance probabilities of the claimed correlations by a uniform method , which allows to compare the strength of correlations and to figure out more probable sources among those suggested previously .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we discuss the logic of the statistical analysis of correlations , describe the methods we use and emphasize several subtle points .",
    "3 lists potential astrophysical sources , briefly recalls motivations for these candidates and previous correlation studies . for each class of sources , we give here references for the catalogs we use in the current study . in sec .  4",
    ", we present the results of the correlation studies for several representative samples of cosmic rays .",
    "the conjectures about positional correlations were formulated on the basis of the cosmic rays observed by agasa , and sometimes by the yakutsk experiment .",
    "we use the samples of cosmic rays with energies @xmath7  ev observed by agasa ( 49 rays ) and by agasa and yakutsk ( 59 rays ) to treat the suggested sources uniformly and to reformulate the conjectures .",
    "we consider independently neutral and proton primaries and in the latter case , we account for proton deflection in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "then , we test the same conjectures with recently published hires stereoscopic data ( 271 cosmic ray with @xmath8  ev ) , assuming only neutral primaries , since energies of the hires events are unpublished .",
    "finally , we look for correlations of suggested sources with the cosmic rays of the highest ( @xmath9  ev ) energies .",
    "5 contains conclusions and discussion .",
    "the general logic of the correlation studies by statistical methods is to test the hypothesis that the distribution of the observed arrival directions of the cosmic rays is _ isotropic _ , and that there is no excess of the cosmic rays at small angular distances from the sources listed in a given catalog ( and _ not _ to test the hypothesis that the sources from the list emit cosmic rays ) . to this end ,",
    "a large number of cosmic - ray events are simulated which arrive at the earth isotropically .",
    "some part of them is `` accepted '' , following the same rules which determine the acceptance of a given cosmic - ray experiment .",
    "the angular distances between the simulated events and the astrophysical objects from the catalog are calculated and their distribution is compared to the distribution of distances between the real cosmic rays and the same objects . the less the probability that the real distribution is a statistical fluctuation of one calculated for isotropic cosmic rays , the stronger the indication that the objects from that particular list may be the cosmic - ray sources .",
    "another way of reasoning might be to simulate the positions of the sources and to compare them with real cosmic rays , or to simulate both .",
    "however , the distribution of the objects of a particular class in the universe follows specific laws and is not easy to be simulated .",
    "the selection biases of discovery , observation , and inclusion in catalogs add more to this problem . on the other hand ,",
    "the directional acceptance of the cosmic - ray detectors is quite well understood and the distribution of the observed cosmic rays agrees with the theoretical acceptance reasonably well .",
    "that is why we simulate the cosmic rays and not the sources .    to compare the real and simulated distributions of angular distances",
    ", we follow a conventional procedure used in correlation studies .",
    "one takes a catalog of @xmath10 cosmic rays observed by a given experiment and calculates the number @xmath11 of events falling within the angular distance @xmath12 from the suggested sources .",
    "the value of @xmath12 should be of order of the experiment s angular resolution .",
    "the actual value at which the real effect is better seen may be determined by simulations described in ref .",
    "@xcite for agasa and yakutsk and in ref .",
    "@xcite for hires stereo . in all cases ,",
    "the simulation gives the value of @xmath13 somewhat larger than the angular resolution .",
    "the reason for this smoothing is quite clear : a significant part of the observed cosmic rays is not related to known sources included in catalogs .",
    "the monte carlo code generates then a random direction in the visible half of the celestial sphere , determined by the azimuth angle @xmath14 and the zenith angle @xmath15 , as well as the sidereal time of the event arrival , @xmath16",
    ". then the code either accepts ( with the probability @xmath17 ) or rejects the event .",
    "the procedure is repeated until @xmath18 sets , each of @xmath10 accepted events , are generated , where @xmath18 is large : we use @xmath19 sets in our study except for the cases of a very strong signal when we use @xmath20 . for the ground arrays , the probability @xmath21 ; for the hires experiment in stereo mode , @xmath22 and the functions @xmath23,@xmath24,@xmath25 are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for each mock set @xmath26 ,",
    "the quantity @xmath27 is calculated .",
    "the probability that the observed distribution of cosmic rays with respect to the sources is a fluctuation of a random distribution is estimated ( for each particular pair of samples of cosmic rays and astrophysical objects ) simply by @xmath28 it is worth noting that the value of @xmath29 should not be , in general , interpreted as the statistically correct probability if subsequent tries with different catalogs were made ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : tries ] ) and if the purpose of a study is to test the null - hypothesis that there are no positional correlations between cosmic rays and any of the astronomical catalogs considered .    for the cosmic - ray experiments with relatively good angular resolution , and assuming charged primaries , the signal may be smeared out by deflections in the magnetic fields .",
    "one may attempt to correct the arrival directions for bending in the galactic magnetic field ( gmf ) , assuming a particular gmf model . in this study ,",
    "when applicable , we assume the gmf model used in ref .",
    "@xcite and proton - like primaries ( electric charge @xmath30 ) .",
    "the knowledge of particle energies is crucial for the correction for gmf and @xmath31 errors in energy determination may result in additional increasing of the value of @xmath12 .",
    "all simulated events are subject to the same correction as the real ones ; to this end , the mc code assigns randomly the energies of @xmath10 observed events to @xmath10 simulated events in each of @xmath18 mock sets .",
    "the cuts imposed by hand on the samples of cosmic rays and possible sources may result in essential lowering of the probability @xmath29 .",
    "one may impose these cuts a posteriori , to maximize the signal , and to compensate the probability by a penalty factor ( see , for instance , ref .",
    "in this study , we do not impose any _ additional _ cuts on the catalogs taken from original works .",
    "all cuts in astronomical catalogs ( e.g.  the @xmath32 cut in a sample of seyfert galaxies or several cuts in a sample of dead qso candidates , see sec .",
    "3 ) were made _ in the original works _ where these candidate objects had been suggested .",
    "we refer the reader to these works for motivation of the cuts . in the catalogs of cosmic rays ,",
    "the cuts in energies and zenith angles were made a priory as well and were determined by the availability of data .",
    "we note here that making cuts which maximize the signal is very useful for further detalization of the class of cosmic - ray emitters but postpone this subject to subsequent studies .",
    "one subtle point in this kind of a study concerns the value of the bin size @xmath12 .",
    "the probability @xmath29 depends strongly on @xmath12 ( see plots in sec .  4 ) .",
    "hence , choice of @xmath12 may be considered as a cut which requires its own penalty factor . however , varying @xmath12 at scales smaller than the angular resolution of a detector , one can easily obtain strong unphysical correlations : one single coincidence within @xmath33 of a source and a cosmic ray observed by a detector with the angular resolution of @xmath34 results in a drop of @xmath29 of order @xmath35 compared to one coincidence within @xmath34 , while physically the two cases have the same meaning ( see fig .  3 in sec .",
    "account of the correlations of this kind in simulated sets may result in strong overestimation of the penalty factor if one chooses to determine @xmath12 a posteriori to maximize the signal and then to compensate for this choice by introducing penalties . in this study , we fix @xmath12 a priori following the simulations of refs .  @xcite .",
    "these values are of order of the experiment s angular resolution : @xmath36 for agasa ( @xmath37 for agasa with gmf correction ) and @xmath38 for hires stereo .",
    "we will see that in the cases when a strong signal is seen , the minimal @xmath29 often corresponds to a different but close value of @xmath12 .    since we are interested in a comparative study of various astrophysical sources only , hence in _ relative _ values of probabilities , and not in testing a hypothesis that the objects of a particular class emit cosmic rays , this approach is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "however , a more adequate method to obtain _ absolute _ values of probabilities should avoid the choice of @xmath12 at all .",
    "indeed , there exist statistical methods to compare distributions without use of explicit binning .",
    "probably the best known one is the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test ; however , in our case it is not applicable for two reasons .",
    "firstly , the ks test does not account for the value of experimental errors . secondly , its sensitivity to differences between distributions close to the end points of the interval at which the distributions are determined is very poor , while the positional correlations appear at values of the angular distances compared to the detector s resolution and much less than the maximal possible angular distance of @xmath39 , that is very close to the zero end point of the interval @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "one may attempt to cut the interval at some angle @xmath41 in order to shift the effect towards the center of the interval ; we checked that the result is very sensitive to @xmath42 in this case .",
    "methods other than the ks test exist which are more sensitive at the ends of an interval , but , as , for instance , the anderson - darling method , they are directly implemented only for the simplest distributions . as a result , this approach awaits further studies .",
    "various classes of potential astrophysical accelerators are discussed , for instance , in ref .",
    "we tried to include in this study all sources mentioned in the literature as candidate sources of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays , subject to two criteria : we require the objects to be persistent ( gamma - ray bursts are excluded in this way ) since the comparison of significance can hardly be performed between persistent sources and flares , and we consider only extragalactic objects since no galactic anisotropy is seen with the impressive statistics of events at @xmath8  ev . for the case of _ unidentified _ gamma - ray sources , to safely exclude galactic populations , we require the galactic latitude @xmath43 . for comparison , we present also results without this cut .",
    "powerful active galactic nuclei , where particles can be accelerated up to extreme energies , are often considered as the best astrophysically motivated sources of energetic cosmic rays . the significant correlations ( @xmath44 ) of the highest - energy ( at least one standard deviation above @xmath45  ev ) events observed by fly s eye , agasa and haverah park and published before 1998 with flat - spectrum radio - loud quasars ( fsrqs ) were first claimed in ref .",

    "for instance , the correlations with unidentified gamma - ray sources are mostly seen for the proton primaries when the deflection of arrival directions in gmf were taken into account ; a similar analysis for the hires sample is impossible at the moment because the energies of the cosmic rays are unpublished .",
    "moreover , the angular resolution of hires stereo is better than uncertainties both in the positions of the egret sources ( which means that the ultra - high - energy astronomy is actually possible ) and in the corrections for gmf .      when the purpose of a study is to estimate the probability that some particular class of objects is related to a sort of events ( uhecrs in our case ) , multiple tries of various catalogs are not welcome .",
    "just by chance , one expects the probability of order @xmath69 to be found among @xmath70 independent catalogs of objects tested for correlations with a single cosmic - ray sample .",
    "thus , a factor of @xmath70 is usually required as a penalty in this case . when the tries are not independent , the penalty factor is more difficult to estimate .",
    "the purpose of our study is , however , purely comparative : we test the conjectures made in previous works by a uniform method . to compare the probabilities , we thus do not care about any general factor by which all the numbers should be multiplied , and this penalty factor in particular .    on the other hand ,",
    "one notices that quite low @xmath29 are found for the catalog 7 with the cosmic rays observed by different experiments .",
    "while this is not our main goal , one may wonder how probable is to obtain @xmath71 in _ independent _ experiments just by chance . in this way",
    ", one would test the hypothesis that there are no catalogs correlating with uhecr samples among all we list and all the correlations seen are nothing but statistical fluctuations due to multiple tries .",
    "we performed a simple estimative simulation to this end .",
    "we took the declinations of objects present in our 21 catalogs and randomized the right ascensions many times . in this way",

    "all @xmath73 simulated catalogs were subject to the same procedure as the real catalogs . only in one case , a simulated catalog exhibited @xmath71 for the hires sample and one of four other ( interdependent ) samples simultaneously .",
    "we thus estimate the probability that the results for the catalog 7 are a result of a chance fluctuation as @xmath74 .",
    "as it has been already noted , the values of the bin sizes we fixed for the calculation of @xmath29 were determined by simulations . in some cases ,",

    "no a posteriori cuts were imposed on the catalogs .",
    "the results are described in sec .",
    "4.2 but should be interpreted with great care because the angular resolution of the cosmic - ray experiments is poor , cosmic magnetic fields are known not quite well and the statistics is not overwhelming .",
    "the analysis of the agasa and yakutsk samples demonstrates the presence of correlations with unidentified egret sources , bl lac s and nearby seyfert galaxies .",
    "the corrections for the galactic magnetic field are very important for these effects .    only bl lac type objects exhibit correlations with the hires stereo sample as well . with",
    "the uncut catalog of 491 confirmed bl lac s and the set of 271 cosmic rays with energies @xmath8  ev , we obtained the probability of @xmath80 for these correlations to result from a random coincidence .",
    "for the updated catalog of 178 bright ( @xmath56 ) bl lac s , the probability is as low as @xmath81 . for the agasa sample ( with the gmf correction ) , @xmath82 for the same catalog ; for agasa and yakutsk @xmath83 .",
    "the probability that one of 21 catalogs exhibits , by chance , @xmath84 both for the hires sample and one of four other samples is about @xmath85 .",
    "the correlations are present at the angular distances of order hires angular resolution and much less than the expected deflections of charged particles in cosmic magnetic fields .",
    "this suggests that a fraction of the cosmic - ray flux at energies @xmath8  ev is carried by neutral primaries  @xcite",
    ".    clearly , more detailed information about the cosmic rays observed by hires would be very important for understanding the effects discussed here .",
    "knowledge of the energies of particles would allow to reconstruct ( to some accuracy ) their deflections in the galactic magnetic field .",
    "a study of shower profiles might help to understand what kind of neutral particles may be present in the cosmic rays and contribute to correlations . finally , if , for example , a neutral primary is a photon emitted by a blazar , the arrival time of the corresponding air shower may coincide with a temporary change in the state of the source .",
    "this would give much stronger support to conjectures about particular cosmic - ray sources than the statistical studies of the arrival directions .",
    "further detailed study will specify which particular physically distinguished subclasses of bl lac s and other objects correlate strongly with the cosmic rays and will give quantitative predictions for the future experiments , in particular for the pierre auger observatory .",
