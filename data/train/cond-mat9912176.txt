    "since the pioneering discoveries of quasicrystals with icosahedral,@xcite dodecagonal,@xcite decagonal,@xcite and octagonal@xcite symmetry , electronic transport phenomena arguably belong to the most celebrated and intriguing physical properties of these intermetallic alloys.@xcite for instance , the electric conductivity of icosahedral quasicrystals decreases strongly with decreasing temperature and with improving structural quality of the sample , and anomalous transport behaviour is also observed in other quantities such as thermopower or magnetoconductance .",
    "stimulated by the experimental results , a lot of effort has been spent towards a better theoretical understanding of the transport phenomena in quasicrystalline materials.@xcite this is also of interest from the theoretical or mathematical point of view , because quasicrystals as ordered aperiodic structures are intermediate between periodically ordered crystals and short - range ordered amorphous solids .",
    "in particular , the anomalous diffusion of wave packets in quasiperiodic systems has attracted wide interest.@xcite    multifractal eigenstates  neither extended over the system , nor exponentially localized  exist at the metal - insulator transition of the anderson model of localization.@xcite in tight - binding models of quasicrystals , this kind of eigenstates has also been revealed.@xcite generally , the energy spectra of one - dimensional ( 1d ) quasicrystals are singular continuous.@xcite however , in higher - dimensional cases , the energy spectra can be band - like with finite measure , fractal - like with zero band width or a mixture of partly band - like and partly fractal - like character.@xcite    the diffusion properties of quasicrystals are associated with the complex eigenstates and energy spectra stated above.@xcite to describe the diffusion of a wave packet initially localized at some site @xmath8 , one usually discusses the temporal autocorrelation function@xcite @xmath9 or the mean square displacement@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the amplitude of the wavefunction at time @xmath12 at the @xmath13th site which is located at the position @xmath14 in space .",
    "apparently , @xmath0 is the time - averaged probability of a wave packet staying at the initial site at time @xmath12 , and @xmath1 determines the spreading of the width of a wave packet .",
    "generally , one finds @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 for 1d quasiperiodic systems.@xcite for higher - dimensional cases , no general results are available .",
    "_ @xcite observed a transition of @xmath0 with the increase of the quasiperiodic modulation strength in simple higher - dimensional fibonacci lattices . for small patches of the octagonal tiling , passaro _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite found @xmath18 with @xmath6 even for the case of a band - like spectrum .",
    "however , one of us obtained @xmath19 for this case after analyzing the long - time behaviour.@xcite in fact , it is quite difficult to derive the exact long - time behaviour of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from the investigation of rather small systems .",
    "therefore , a study of a large higher - dimensional quasiperiodic system will be significant . in this paper",
    ", we will mainly discuss the diffusion properties on a 2d quasiperiodic tiling related to the octagonal quasicrystals .",
    "the tiling is based on the octonacci chain and thus permits us to study large systems .",
    "recent investigations show that the diffusion properties are connected with the multifractality of eigenstates and energy spectra.@xcite it can be rigorously proven that the exponent @xmath20 ruling the decay of the autocorrelation function @xmath0 equals the correlation dimension @xmath21 of the local spectral measure associated with the initial site.@xcite in 1d quasiperiodic systems , guarneri@xcite analytically deduced that @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the information dimension of the spectral measure .",
    "more recently , ketzmerick _ et al . _ @xcite argued that @xmath7 is also related to the multifractal properties of the eigenstates .",
    "we shall address the question whether these relations exist in different quasiperiodic systems , especially in higher - dimensional cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we describe the construction of the labyrinth tiling and its properties that are relevant for our analysis .",
    "afterwards , in sec .  [ sec2b ] , we consider a tight - binding model on the labyrinth tiling and express the eigenstates and eigenvalues in terms of eigenstates and eigenvalues of a tight - binding hamiltonian on the octonacci chain . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we show the energy spectra and multifractal eigenstates for both these systems .",
    "[ sec4 ] describes the diffusion properties of the octonacci chain .",
    "the diffusion properties of the labyrinth tiling will be emphasized in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec6 ] we discuss the fractal dimensions of eigenstates and eigenspectra and their relation to the diffusion properties . finally , we conclude in sec .",
    "the labyrinth tiling@xcite can be considered as a subset of the octagonal quasiperiodic tiling,@xcite and vice versa.@xcite one can build it directly from the octonacci chain . in order to construct the labyrinth tiling",
    ", we introduce the octonacci sequence which can be produced by iterating the inflation rule @xmath24 on the initial word @xmath25 . the number of letters @xmath26 in the @xmath27th iterate @xmath28 satisfies the recursion @xmath29 the numbers of letters @xmath30 and @xmath31 in @xmath32 are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively , which fulfill the same recursion relation with a different initial condition @xmath35 such that @xmath36 .",
    "their ratio in the limit sequence @xmath37 @xmath38 is given by the silver mean @xmath39 which is a root of the quadratic equation @xmath40 .",
    "as can been seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : gm ] ) , @xmath41 is odd for all @xmath27 .    associating with the letters @xmath31 and @xmath30 intervals of length @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively ,",
    "one obtains a linear chain @xmath44 of @xmath45 sites , which is known as octonacci or silver mean chain.@xcite we note that all words @xmath32 obtained from the substitution rule ( [ eq : subst ] ) are palindromes , thus the resulting chains are symmetric under reflection .",
    "the labyrinth tiling can be constructed from the euclidean product @xmath46 of two such chains .",
    "this product is a rectangular grid , thus its vertices can be classified into _ even _ and _ odd _ vertices if they can be reached from the origin by an _ even _ or _ odd _ number of steps along the bonds , respectively .",
    "this is completely analogous to the even and the odd sublattice of the square lattice .",
    "connecting the _ even _ vertices by diagonal bonds , we obtain a finite approximant @xmath47 of the labyrinth tiling @xmath48 .",
    "the _ odd _",
    "vertices , when connected by diagonal bonds , form another labyrinth tiling @xmath49 that is dual to @xmath50 .",
    "we note that , due to the palindromicity of @xmath32 , @xmath50 and @xmath49 just differ by a @xmath51 degree rotation.@xcite the finite labyrinth tiling @xmath52 consists of @xmath53 atoms .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] . by construction ,",
    "the labyrinth tiling is symmetric with respect to reflection at the main diagonal . taking this diagonal as the @xmath54 axis and the direction orthogonal to it as the @xmath55 axis",
    ", the coordinates of the vertices of the labyrinth tiling , labeled by @xmath56 , can be written as@xcite    @xmath57    where the coordinates with _ even _ values of @xmath58 belong to @xmath48 , those with _",
    "odd _ values of @xmath58 to @xmath59 . here , @xmath60\\ ] ] where @xmath61 $ ] denotes the integer closest to @xmath54 .",
    "it is easy to see that the sequence of long and short lengths given by @xmath62 again follows the octonacci sequence , but now the two intervals have lengths @xmath63 which again have ratio @xmath64 .",
    "thus , the diagonal of the labyrinth @xmath65 is just a @xmath66-scaled version of the original octonacci sequence .",
    "the energy spectra for tight - binding hamiltonians on the labyrinth tiling were investigated by sire.@xcite for properly chosen hamiltonians , the analysis reduces to the one - dimensional case , and the energy spectrum can be derived directly from those of the corresponding hamiltonian on the octonacci chain .",
    "however , the properties of eigenstates , which also factorize into the product of two eigenstates of the octonacci chain , were not discussed in ref .  . here",
    ", we follow the same route to study the eigenvalues and eigenstates .",
    "consider two identical octonacci chains in the framework of a tight - binding model with zero on - site potentials    @xmath67    where superscripts @xmath68 and @xmath69 label the two chains and the indices @xmath70 and @xmath71 enumerate the eigenfunctions @xmath72 and eigenvalues @xmath73 of the two octonacci chains . throughout the paper ,",
    "we employ free boundary conditions , which formally corresponds to setting @xmath74 .",
    "the hopping parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 take values according to the octonacci sequence .",
    "we associate @xmath77 to a _",
    "long _ bond of length @xmath43 and @xmath78 to a _ short _ bond of length @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "the eigenvalues of the octonacci chain are symmetric with respect to @xmath79 ; if @xmath72 is an eigenstate of @xmath80 with eigenvalue @xmath73 , then the state @xmath81 with amplitudes @xmath82 is again an eigenstate , but has an eigenvalue @xmath83 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the eigenvalue equation reduces to the recursion @xmath84 which always yields precisely _ two _ linearly independent solutions @xmath85 which can be chosen to vanish on either _ even _ or _ odd _ sites .",
    "these have the form @xmath86 and @xmath87 where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are determined , up to phases , by normalization .",
    "we note that one has to be careful if one employs periodic boundary conditions because these , for an odd length of the chain , couple the even and odd sublattices of the chain .",
    "thus , while there are again two states ( [ eq : psim ] ) and ( [ eq : psip ] ) for a periodic chain of even length , only a single state at @xmath79 exists for an odd length of the chain .    multiplying the two eqs .",
    "( [ eq : toc1 ] ) and ( [ eq : toc2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath90 where we defined @xmath91 as an eigenfunction on the product of the two chains with eigenvalue @xmath92 . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) , only wave function amplitudes at positions @xmath93 contribute , thus the hamiltonian @xmath94 corresponds to hopping along the _ diagonals _ of the product grid @xmath46 .",
    "the corresponding hopping parameters are the product of two hopping parameters in the octonacci chain and thus take values @xmath42 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 for diagonals of length @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "thus the system in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prod ] ) naturally separates into _ two _ independent sets of equations with @xmath58 _ even _ or @xmath58 _ odd _ , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we restrict our investigation to the case with @xmath58 even as the other case is completely analogous .",
    "thus , @xmath94 can be interpreted as a tight - binding hamiltonian with zero on - site potential defined on the labyrinth tiling @xmath100 .",
    "clearly , the eigenvalues for the labyrinth are just products of the eigenvalues for the octonacci chain , and all such products appear as eigenvalues because the spectra of the two dual labyrinth tilings @xmath50 and @xmath101 are identical . for the corresponding eigenfunctions on @xmath48 , we have to construct linear combinations of the product eigenfunctions @xmath102 ( [ eq : prodef ] ) which vanish on the vertices of the dual tiling @xmath101 .",
    "this can be done as follows .",
    "suppose @xmath103 and @xmath104 are normalized eigenfunctions of the octonacci chain with eigenvalues @xmath105 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "then both @xmath107 and @xmath108 ( [ eq : tilde ] ) are eigenfunctions of @xmath94 with the same eigenvalue @xmath109 , where we assume @xmath110 and @xmath111 . but from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tilde ] ) we have @xmath112 and thus the linear combinations @xmath113 are normalized eigenfunctions that vanish for _ odd _ or for _ even _ values of @xmath58 , and thus on @xmath114 or @xmath48 , respectively . if one or both eigenvalues @xmath105 and @xmath106 are zero , we can make use of the previously discussed eigenfunctions @xmath115 ( [ eq : psip ] ) and @xmath116 ( [ eq : psim ] ) to construct the desired wavefunctions . if one of the eigenvalues vanishes , say , without loss of generality , @xmath117 and @xmath111 , the appropriate four linear combinations are @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the wavefunction of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : psip ] ) and ( [ eq : psim ] ) on the first chain , and we also used the state @xmath120 which has an energy @xmath121 .",
    "clearly , the wave functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 have support on @xmath48 , the other two linear combinations @xmath124 and @xmath125 live on @xmath59 .",
    "finally , for @xmath126 , we have four states @xmath127 where again @xmath122 and @xmath123 are supported on @xmath48 , and the remaining two product states @xmath124 and @xmath125 on @xmath114 . in particular",
    ", this argument proves that @xmath79 is a @xmath128-fold degenerate eigenvalue for the labyrinth @xmath52 .",
    "thus we find , as for simple tight - binding hamiltonians on the penrose@xcite or the octagonal ammann - beenker tiling , a large degeneracy of states in the `` band '' center at @xmath79 .",
    "however , in contrast to these well - known examples where the degeneracy stems from certain `` confined '' states@xcite that occur as a consequence of the local topology of the tilings , the spectral measure carried by the states at @xmath79 vanishes for the labyrinth as @xmath129 , thus it is not a finite fraction of the eigenstates that contributes to @xmath79 in this case .    in practice ,",
    "having the complete knowledge of the eigenstates for the labyrinth tiling at our disposal , we do not need to care too much about the precise linear combinations of states derived above .",
    "since the eigenvalues @xmath130 , @xmath131 of the octonacci chain are symmetric about zero , one can obtain the set of eigenvalues of the labyrinth tiling simply as @xmath132 where we assume that the eigenvalues of the octonacci chain are ordered as @xmath133 for @xmath134 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvectors are most easily constructed by just restricting the products of eigenvectors to the sites of the labyrinth @xmath48 , and re - normalizing the resulting eigenstate .",
    "( [ eq : tilde ] ) guarantees that this procedure yields the correct results , because the states @xmath72 and @xmath81 just differ by an alternating sign .",
    "following the results of sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] , one can easily calculate the density of states ( dos ) and the integrated density of states ( idos ) . for comparison",
    ", we show the dos and the idos for the octonacci chain and the labyrinth tiling in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] . for the octonacci chain ,",
    "the idos is a devil s staircase even for @xmath95 close to @xmath42 and the dos is singular continuous with zero lebesgue measure . by more detailed analysis",
    ", one finds a self - similar energy spectrum for the octonacci chain with a hierarchical gap structure as described by the gap labelling theorem.@xcite in contrast , we observed a smooth idos without visual gaps as @xmath95 approaches @xmath42 in the labyrinth tiling . a more detailed analysis of the idos and the energy spectra shows that in the regime @xmath135 the energy spectrum contains no or a finite number of gaps ; for @xmath136 the spectrum is fractal - like and the idos is similar to a devil s staircase .",
    "sire found that the spectrum is singular continuous with _",
    "finite _ lebesgue measure for @xmath137,@xcite which may indicate that the spectrum is a mixture of band - like and fractal - like parts in the regime @xmath138 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) one can see a peak at the center of the spectrum which is due to the degenerate states at @xmath79 .",
    "but it differs from the localized states observed in the penrose tiling@xcite in the sense that no leap at @xmath79 is seen in the idos , in agreement with the results of the previous section . for varying parameter @xmath95",
    ", we find three regions with different behaviour of the dos of the labyrinth tiling : a maximum around the center , distinct shoulders located between the spectral center and edge , and a tail at the band edge , which is similar to the behaviour observed for a tight - binding model on the icosahedral ammann - kramer tiling.@xcite    in order to characterize the eigenstates , we employ a multifractal analysis , which is based on the standard box - counting procedure.@xcite in our numerical calculations , we determine the singularity strength @xmath139 and the corresponding fractal dimension @xmath140 by a linear regression procedure , but prior to this we need to check the linearity of @xmath141 versus @xmath142 , where @xmath143 denotes the normalized @xmath144th moment of the box probability for boxes of linear size @xmath145 .",
    "a homogenously extended wave function corresponds to @xmath146 , where @xmath147 denotes the spatial dimension . for critical eigenstates ,",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath148 is a smooth convex function of @xmath149 , and @xmath149 should be limited to a @xmath144-interval .",

    "in contrast to the behaviour observed for the penrose tiling,@xcite for the labyrinth tiling we do not find that the multifractal behaviour of eigenstates becomes significantly stronger when moving from energies at the edge towards the center of the `` band '' .",

    "as for the octagonal tiling@xcite and for the octonacci chain , @xmath6 for the labyrinth tiling . therefore , a band spectrum does not imply ballistic diffusion in quasicrystals .",

    "in 1d quasiperiodic systems , it is known that the inequality @xmath188 relates the diffusion behaviour and the fractal properties of the energy spectrum.@xcite in @xmath147 dimensions , this generalizes to the inequality @xmath189 , thus it implies a superdiffusive behaviour @xmath190 in two dimensions if @xmath191 . in fig .",

    "the labyrinth tiling is based on the octonacci chain , which allows us to deal with very large systems . for the octonacci chain ,",
    "the energy spectra are singular continuous and the eigenstates are critical .",
    "the energy spectra of the labyrinth tiling presumably are also singular continuous , but they can be band - like ( i.e. , of finite lebesgue measure ) with zero or finite gaps , a mixture of band - like and fractal parts , or fractal - like upon increasing the modulation strength",
    ". however , the eigenstates are multifractal irrespective of the value of the modulation parameter .",
    "the propagation of an initial wave packet is discussed in terms of the autocorrelation function @xmath0 and the mean square displacement @xmath1 .",
    "numerical results show that @xmath2 and @xmath3 for the octonacci chain and the labyrinth tiling . corresponding to the multifractal eigenstates , we observe @xmath6 for both systems . in the case of fractal - like or mixed energy spectra and multifractal eigenstates",
    ", we find @xmath4 .",
    "however , for a band - like spectrum , @xmath19 as in a periodic system , which causes a qualitative change of behaviour in @xmath0 for the labyrinth tiling at a parameter value @xmath206 .",
    "similar effects have also been observed for fibonacci lattices@xcite and for the octagonal tiling.@xcite    we believe that the anomalous diffusion shown in @xmath1 and the crossover of the autocorrelation @xmath0 will be a common phenomenon in 2d quasiperiodic systems .",
    "of course , to observe the crossover in @xmath0 one needs a parameter that allows one to continuously move away from the periodic case , which is not easily at hand for the most commonly investigated quasiperiodic model systems such as the penrose or the octagonal tiling .",
    "finally , we also studied the influence of different initial wave packets by choosing the eigenstates from various energy windows .",
    "the results show that the behaviour of @xmath0 and @xmath1 does not depend significantly on the shape and the location of the initial wave packet .    comparing the values of @xmath7 with several expressions involving the fractal dimensions of energy spectra and eigenstates that were proposed in the literature , we find that the inequality @xmath207 of ref",
    ".   holds true .",
    "however , it seems that the bound @xmath208 proposed recently by zhong _ et al._@xcite may be violated for parameter values @xmath95 close to one , i.e. , close to the periodic case .",
    "however , we find that the weaker condition @xmath209 is always satisfied .",
    "our present work corroborates that there are strong relations between fractal properties of energy spectra and wavefunctions on the one hand and the exponents describing the quantum diffusion on the other hand .",
    "however , it appears to be difficult to find relations that give quantitative agreement for one- and two - dimensional aperiodic systems . here",
    ", a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is desirable .",
    "higher - dimensional systems constructed as products of one - dimensional systems , such as the labyrinth tiling , provide useful toy examples for further investigations which can , at least , be treated numerically in an efficient way .",
