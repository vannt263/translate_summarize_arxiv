    "at the heart of an active galactic nucleus lies the putative black - hole `` monster '' that supplies its power .",
    "much of this power emerges in the form of x - rays , which are in turn efficient probes of the immediate regions surrounding the nucleus .",
    "the fuel supply for the massive central engine is thought to arise from a disk of dense , accreting matter with column densities @xmath9 well in excess of @xmath10 @xmath11 . in the presence of such matter , the reflected x - ray spectrum has two distinct features .",
    "one is the fe k@xmath2 fluorescence emission line at 6.4 kev ( fabian et al .",
    "1989 , george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "the other is compton reflection , a broad hump centered on a few tens of kev with a shape governed by photoelectric absorption at low energies and by compton recoil and the declining scattering cross - section at high energies ( lightman & white 1988 ; guilbert & rees 1988 ) .",
    "the ubiquity of fe k@xmath2 lines in seyfert galaxies is well established .",
    "recent results from the advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( @xmath5 ) suggest that many of these lines in seyfert 1 galaxies exhibit relativistic profiles that are caused by photons emerging near a black hole , and thus they most likely originate in an accretion disk ( nandra et al .",
    "whether compton reflection is as common is not known .",
    "although hard x - ray observations with @xmath12 show that compton reflection is clearly present in the _ composite _ spectrum of eight bright seyfert 1 galaxies ( pounds et al .",
    "1990 ) , the level of significance of this feature and constraints for theoretical reflection models are poor for most _ individual _ objects in the @xmath12 sample ( smith & done 1996 , nandra & pounds 1994 ) .",
    "the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( @xmath1 ) provides the large bandpass coverage and collecting area necessary to allow the unambiguous detection of compton reflection in many individual seyfert galaxies for the first time .",
    "mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 is an x - ray bright active galaxy with an optical classification of seyfert 1.9 ( veron et al .  1980 ) .",
    "in the 20 years since its discovery , its 2 to 10 kev flux has varied by a factor of 4 from a high state of @xmath13 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath4 in 1978 ( tennant 1983 ) , to a low state of @xmath14 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath4 in 1989 ( nandra & pounds 1994 ) , to a high state of @xmath15 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath4 in 1996 ( this work ) . in its high - flux state ,",
    "mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 is among the five brightest seyfert galaxies in hard x - rays .",
    "@xmath5 observations show the fe k@xmath2 line to be significantly broadened with a fwzi of @xmath3120,000 km s@xmath4 and an unusually complex profile ( weaver et al .",
    "1997 , hereafter w97 ) .",
    "the signature of compton reflection has not before been detected in this galaxy .",
    "here we present the first results for mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 from @xmath1 .",
    "this work showcases the data quality , and more importantly , the power of using @xmath1 for purposes of x - ray spectroscopy studies of active galaxies .",
    "this paper describes early results from a comprehensive spectral and variability study of mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 that involves simultaneous @xmath5 observations .",
    "the @xmath5 results and a joint analysis of the @xmath5 and @xmath1 data will be presented in a future paper .",
    "@xmath1 was launched on 30 december 1995 and carries three scientific instruments : the proportional counter array ( pca ) , the high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ) , and the all - sky monitor ( asm ) . here",
    "we present data from the pca , which consists of five collimated ( 1@xmath16 fwhm ) proportional counter units ( pcus ) that contain three multi - anode detector layers with a mixture of xenon and methane gas .",
    "the pcus are numbered 0 through 4 .",
    "each has a bandpass of 2 to 60 kev , a geometric collecting area of @xmath31,400 @xmath17 , and a fwhm energy resolution of @xmath3 8% at 6.6 kev .",
    "see glasser , odell , and seufert ( 1994 ) for a detailed description of the pca .",
    "mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 was observed with @xmath1 from november 27 to 30 1996 , for about @xmath3100 ks .",
    "there was an overlapping observation with @xmath5 that began about half way through the @xmath1 observation on 29 november 1996 and lasted for approximately 35 ks .",
    "we do not discuss the most recent @xmath5 data here except to use the observed photon index and absorbing column density ( weaver et al .",
    ", in prep ) to constrain the @xmath1 fits .    to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio between 2 and 10 kev , we accumulate photon events from the top xenon / methane layer of the pca .",
    "we also use only pcus 0 through 3 ; data from pcu 4 is discarded because this detector is turned on for a smaller fraction of the on - source time due to breakdown .",
    "data is discarded for times of earth occult ( when the earth elevation angle is less than 10@xmath16 ) , passage of the satellite through the south atlantic anomaly ( saa ) , and when there is severe electron contamination .",
    "this yields a total integration time of @xmath380 ksec . for the total spectrum ,",
    "the small statistical errors on the data points combined with systematic uncertainties in the detector response matrix cause large values of @xmath18 . also , the background subtraction is not yet accurate for the complete observation due to small variations in the internal background that are not accounted for in the current background model .",
    "we therefore use an 11 ksec exposure that coincides with the @xmath5 observation on 29 november 1996 , and is accumulated from @xmath19 s to @xmath20 s @xmath1 mission elapsed time . for this snapshot , poisson statistics are an acceptable description of the point to point variations in the data , the systematic errors have a minimal impact on our results because they are comparable to the statistical errors , and the background model works appropriately .",
    "the pca detector response matrix was generated by adding together matrices for pcus 0 , 1 , 2 , and 3 that were supplied by the @xmath1 guest observer facility ( gof ) at the goddard space flight center .",
    "the individual matrices represent the most up - to - date pca calibration and were created 26 august 1997 using _ pcarmf _ v2.2.1 . at the time of this writing the in - flight energy resolution of the pca detectors has not been precisely determined , but based on spectral fits to line emission from cas - a , the most likely value has been measured to within @xmath31% ( keith jahoda , 1997 private communication ) .",
    "we therefore use two response matrices that bracket the possible values of the energy resolution .",
    "the v2.2.1 matrix has a fwhm resolution of 7.5% at 6.6 kev ( resolution factor of 0.75 ) as the default value .",
    "the two response matrices that bracket the most appropriate value for cas - a have multiplicative factors of 1.07 and 1.13 on the default resolution yielding effective resolution factors of 0.8 and 0.85 , or 8.0% and 8.5% fwhm resolution at 6.6 kev .",
    "these response matrices are labeled m8 and m85 in the spectral fits discussed below . in the work presented here ,",
    "the uncertainty in the resolution only affects the significance of detection of the broad fe k@xmath2 line .",
    "power - law fits to the spectrum of the crab with the v2.2.1 response matrix yield residuals less than 2% at all energies included in our fits ( keith jahoda , 1997 private communication ) .",
    "the amount of background internal to the pcus varies according to the orbital environment of the satellite .",
    "there are no detectors offset from the science axis to allow a simultaneous measurement of the background , and so the standard procedure that has been developed by the @xmath1 gof is to model the internal and cosmic background .",
    "the background for mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 was modeled in february 1997 with the @xmath21 program .",
    "the internal background was predicted from the particle and activation models that have been derived from earth - occult data .",
    "the particle model is based on the value of the housekeeping parameter q6 , which tracks the instantaneous particle flux by measuring the rate of events that trigger exactly 6 of the lower level discriminators in each pcu .",
    "the activation model estimates the additional background that is present in the detectors after the satellite passes through an saa .",
    "after background subtraction , the pca count rate for mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 is @xmath340 counts s@xmath4 .",
    "the 11 ksec spectrum contains @xmath22 photons .",
    "we estimate that the current background model is reliable up to energies of 30 kev and ignore pulse - height channels above this energy .",
    "channels below 2.8 kev are ignored because of remaining calibration uncertainties involving partial charge collection ( keith jahoda , 1997 private communication ) .",
    "data are modeled with the @xmath23 spectral fitting package and @xmath18 statistics are used .",
    "mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 has a large absorbing column of @xmath9 @xmath32 @xmath24 @xmath11 .",
    "this column is measurable with the pca , but because of ongoing calibration issues at the lowest energies , a systematic error may exist in this measurement that would affect our spectral results .",
    "therefore , we use the information that the simultaneous @xmath5 data provide near energies of 2 kev to place an additional constraint on our spectral modeling . in all cases ,",
    "we fix the absorbing column density at @xmath25 @xmath11 ( weaver et al . , in prep ) , which was obtained by fitting the most recent ( simultaneous with @xmath1 ) @xmath5 data from @xmath26 kev with an absorbed power - law model .",
    "this column is identical to that measured during the 1994 observation ( @xmath27 @xmath11 ; w97 ) .",
    "the results of spectral fitting are listed in table 1 .",
    "we use three models to describe the spectrum : a power law ( n@xmath28 ) , a power law plus a gaussian , and a compton reflection model plus a gaussian .",
    "the reflection model is the @xmath29 model in @xmath23 , which is an exponentially cut - off power - law spectrum reflected from a disk of neutral material ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) .",
    "the free parameters are the photon index of the primary power - law spectrum ( @xmath30 ) , the cutoff energy of the primary power - law spectrum ( @xmath31 ) , the abundance of heavy elements ( @xmath32 ) , the relative amount of reflection compared to the directly - viewed primary spectrum ( @xmath33 ) , the inclination angle of the disk normal to our line of sight ( @xmath6 ) , and the power - law normalization ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath33 is equal to 1 for the case of an isotropic x - ray source above a disk with a covering factor @xmath35 = 0.5 ( @xmath36 = 2@xmath37 ) as viewed from the x - ray source .",
    "the amount of reflected flux depends on @xmath6 and @xmath32 , with larger inclinations and/or larger abundances producing less reflection ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "in addition , because of the contribution to the reflection hump by down - scattering of high energy photons , the amount of reflection depends on the cutoff energy of the primary power - law spectrum . if @xmath31 is larger than a few hundred kev , there is no significant reduction in the amount of reflection at @xmath3830 kev in comparison to a pure power - law spectrum ; however , if @xmath31 is less than a few hundred kev , there are fewer primary photons that can scatter to energies below 30 kev .",
    "to test the effect of varying @xmath31 , we examine models with @xmath31 = 60 kev , 200 kev , and 500 kev .",
    "cutoff energies much less than 60 kev are unlikely because they provide poor fits unless @xmath30 @xmath38 1.75 , which is outside the range of indices allowed for the intrinsic spectrum by the simultaneous @xmath5 data ( weaver et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "a value of @xmath31 = 200 kev approximates the cutoff implied by fits to non - simultaneous osse and @xmath12 data for mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 ( fig .  7 in zdziarski ,",
    "johnson , & magdziarz 1996 ) and is similar to the mean cutoff energy for radio - quiet seyfert 1 galaxies ( gondek et al .",
    "the upper limit of 500 kev is chosen simply to have no appreciable effect in the pca bandpass .",
    "we also assume solar abundances and allow only one of the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath6 to be free for a given fit .    for all models ,",
    "the spectral parameters and statistical error bars that are derived using response matrices m8 and m85 (  2 ) are similar , if not identical , and so we list only the numbers derived using m8 in the table ( columns 2 through 8) . the difference between m8 and m85 does matter when assessing the significance of detection of the broad fe k@xmath2 line .",
    "we therefore list the values of @xmath39 , the f - statistic , and the probability of exceeding f for both m8 and m85 in columns 10 , 11 , and @xmath40 . for fits that include reflection , we also list three best - fit values for the parameters that are most dependent on @xmath31 .",
    "these are the iron line equivalent width ( w@xmath41 , column 5 ) and @xmath6 or @xmath33 ( columns 7 and 8) .",
    "the top entry corresponds to @xmath31 = 500 kev , the middle entry corresponds to @xmath31 = 200 kev , and the bottom entry corresponds to @xmath31 = 60 kev .",
    "models that do not include reflection provide formally unacceptable fits .",
    "an absorbed power law with @xmath31 placed above the pca bandpass provides an exremly poor fit ( table 1 , fit 1 ) with @xmath42 for 57 d.o.f .",
    "the poorness of this fit is illustrated in figure 1 , which shows the pca data and the power - law model folded through the instrumental response .",
    "the residuals for the fit are plotted in the bottom panel . adding a narrow gaussian to the model provides a large improvement ( table 1 , fit 2 , fig .",
    "2a ) , but the fit is still statistically unacceptable with @xmath39 @xmath3 1.5 for 55 d.o.f .",
    "the probability of obtaining such a large value of @xmath18 by chance is only @xmath30.01 . if the line is allowed to be broad ( table 1 , fit 3 , fig .",
    "2b ) , the fit is improved significantly for response m8 , but not for m85 , as indicated by the small f - statistic and large probability of exceeding f in columns 14 and 16 .",
    "this fit , however , remains formally unacceptable for both matrices ( columns 10 and 11 ) with a probability of @xmath30.02 for obtaining such large values of @xmath18 by chance .",
    "models that include reflection provide formally acceptable fits ( table 1 , fits @xmath43 ) . to examine",
    "how significant this improvement is compared to models that include only the iron line , we compare the fit with a power law and a broad gaussian ( fit 3 ) , to a fit with a power law plus reflection and a narrow gaussian ( fit 4 , fig .",
    "2c ) . for the fit with reflection ,",
    "the decrease in @xmath18 is large compared to the fit without reflection ; @xmath44 = 14 for m8 and @xmath44 = 21 for m85 .",
    "f - statistic values are not listed for fit 4 because the f - statistic can not be used in this case to accept or reject the hypothesis that reflection provides a better fit to the data than a broad line .",
    "instead , we calculate the ratio of likelihoods ( edwards 1972 ) for the reflection plus narrow gaussian model versus the power law plus broad gaussian model . this ratio is defined as l@xmath45/l@xmath46 = exp[@xmath47 for two models .",
    "we find that reflection plus a narrow gaussian is 1,100 to 36,000 times more likely to be the correct description of the data than a power law and broad gaussian , assuming that the errors are normally distributed .",
    "we next examine whether a broad line is detected when reflection is included in the model ( table 1 , fits 5 to 7 ) . to test the range of allowed parameter space ,",
    "we assume different values for @xmath6 and @xmath33 .",
    "for fits 5 and 6 , we fix @xmath6 at values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which cover the range of most likely inclinations for a neutral accretion disk measured from @xmath5 studies of the fe k@xmath2 line profile ( w97 ) .",
    "angles less than @xmath48 are the least preferred by the @xmath1 data because they yield poor fits unless @xmath31 is as low as @xmath50 kev , which we have already ruled out since this requires the intrinsic spectrum to be too flat . for @xmath51 , @xmath33 is small and ranges from 0.36 to 0.80 implying covering factors of @xmath52 ; however , for @xmath53 , @xmath33 is large and ranges from 2.9 to 5.9 , implying unphysical covering factors of @xmath54 .",
    "if we instead fix @xmath33 at 1.0 ( fit 7 ) , then @xmath6 ranges from 63@xmath16 to 81@xmath16 ( best - fit values ) with a 90% confidence range of 50@xmath16 to 87@xmath16 .",
    "our results clearly show that @xmath33 , @xmath6 , and @xmath31 are strongly coupled . for a given @xmath33 , smaller inclinations and",
    "w@xmath41 are allowed for a low @xmath31 , while for a given @xmath6 , a low @xmath31 allows more reflection and hence a larger @xmath35 .",
    "the confidence contours for fit 7 for the width of the fe k@xmath2 line vs.  @xmath6 for @xmath31 = 200 kev are shown in figure 3 .",
    "for all of the above cases , a broad line significantly improves the fit over a narrow line , as indicated by the f - statistic @xmath55 .",
    "the probability of exceeding f by chance ranges from 0.05 for the worst case ( and the poorest overall fit ) to @xmath380.001 . for fit 7 , the @xmath56 kev flux is @xmath57 ergs @xmath11 s@xmath4 .    finally , we examine whether the gas that reprocesses x - rays is ionized by replacing the @xmath29 model , which calculates reflection from a neutral disk , with the @xmath58 model , which calculates reflection from an ionized disk .",
    "the @xmath58 model adds the free parameters of disk temperature and ionization parameter , but yields no improvement to the fit compared to the neutral case .",
    "also , the best - fitting ionization parameter is zero .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that the peak energy of the fe k@xmath2 line is approximately equal to that expected for fluorescence from neutral iron ( 6.4 kev in the galaxy rest frame ) , and rules out significant ionization of the disk .",
    "we conclude that compton reflection @xmath59 a broad fe k@xmath2 line from a dense , neutral reflector are detected in mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 with @xmath1 . in an 11 ksec exposure ,",
    "the line width is well constrained .",
    "there is also little difficulty in statistically separating the reflection component from the broad iron line , a problem that has plagued the analysis of data from missions such as @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "we have shown that both compton reflection and a broad fe k@xmath2 line are detected in the @xmath1 spectrum of mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 .",
    "this is the first clear detection of reflection in this galaxy , and the broad fe k@xmath2 line confirms the reality of the broad line in the @xmath5 data ( w97 ) .",
    "detecting a broad fe k@xmath2 line with @xmath1 in a seyfert 1.9 galaxy provides the first independent confirmation of @xmath5 detections of broad lines in these objects .",
    "this also puts to rest the idea that the broad lines seen by @xmath5 are spurious features caused by a `` continuum conspiracy '' , where a complex continuum mimics a broad line .",
    "the significance of detection of the broad line ( i.e. , having @xmath60 kev ) depends somewhat on the response matrix .",
    "however , even for the worst - fitting reflection model , a broad line is detected at @xmath6195% confidence .",
    "for the best - fitting reflection models , a broad line is detected at greater than 99% confidence .",
    "examining the parameter space for reflection models , we tested disk inclinations that range from @xmath6 = 50@xmath16 to 87@xmath16 , as suggested by a detailed study of the fe k@xmath2 profile ( w97 ) .",
    "the parameters of disk inclination ( @xmath6 ) , the amount of reflection ( @xmath33 ) , and the high - energy cutoff ( @xmath31 ) are strongly correlated .",
    "if we allow the amount of reflection to be a free parameter , then an angle of 50@xmath16 provides the poorest fit of the models we tested . for @xmath31 = 500 kev",
    ", @xmath33 is small but for @xmath31 = 60 kev , @xmath33 becomes consistent with 1 , which is the value expected if the reprocessing gas is in the form of a disk .",
    "an angle of 87@xmath16 provides the best fit , but for this case we find the opposite result : for @xmath31 = 500 kev , @xmath33 is consistent with 1 , but for @xmath31 = 60 kev , @xmath33 is quite large and implies an unphysical covering factor of neutral reflecting material of @xmath54 . assuming instead a normal disk geometry with @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , the fit is statistically comparable to the best - fit , and we confirm the above result , namely that @xmath6 can range from 50@xmath16 to 87@xmath16 for high - energy cutoffs in the primary spectrum ranging from 60 to 500 kev .",

    "( 1997 ; hereafter t97 ) derive different inclinations from @xmath5 using different techniques .",

    "assume fluorescence from a neutral disk with @xmath62 ; however , w97 use a two - component model that consists of a disk line and a narrow gaussian at 6.4 kev ( which represents emission from gas further out ) , while t97 fit the entire line with a disk line .",
    "additionally , w97 assume an outer disk radius of @xmath69 ( @xmath70 = gm/@xmath71 ) and derive the following three parameters : the disk emissivity index , @xmath72 ( r@xmath73 ) , the inner disk radius , @xmath74 , and the inclination ( @xmath6 ) .",

    "it is not possible to prove which assumptions are correct because the geometry of the disk , the emissivity profile as a function of radius , and even whether or not all of the fluorescence arises from an accretion disk , are not known _ a priori_. we conclude that the inclination derived from the line profile does not necessarily represent of the true inclination of the accretion disk .",
    "the range of inclinations derived from @xmath1 from the amount of compton reflection is 50@xmath80 ( 90% confidence ) , in agreement with w97 .",
    "one problem for all of these analyses , including the current one , is the large equivalent width of the disk line . for @xmath31 = 500 kev",

    "this is still a problem , however , because the equivalent width for an edge - on disk is expected to be much smaller than 160 ev .",
    "in fact , w@xmath41 predicted for a neutral disk viewed at our best - fitting inclination of 81@xmath16 for an incident spectrum with @xmath30 = 1.9 is only @xmath350 ev ( george & fabian 1991 ) .",
    "clearly , there is too much flux in the iron line to be produced by such a disk .",
    "large equivalent widths can be produced if the accretion disk is ionized , but the @xmath1 data rule out this possibility .",
    "besides the dependence of w@xmath41 on disk inclination and @xmath30 , w@xmath41 is proportional to the iron abundance and the covering factor of reflecting material .",
    "if we assume almost complete coverage of the x - ray source ( @xmath35 = 0.99 ) , an equivalent width as large as 170 ev restricts the disk to be inclined by no more than 70@xmath16 ( george & fabian 1991 ) . for the case of @xmath31 = 500 kev ,",

    "= 60 and 200 kev , the 90% confidence range of inclinations is 50@xmath16 to 81@xmath16 , which allows equivalent widths as large as @xmath3130 ev for a neutral disk with @xmath35 = 0.5 . to produce a value as large as w@xmath81 ev",

    "this technique of comparing the relative fluxes in the fe k line and reflection hump thus allows us to infer the presence of a high - energy cutoff in the intrinsic spectrum and to place approximate limits on @xmath31 of 60 to 200 kev .",
    "our analysis clearly demonstrates the model - dependence of disk inclination angle and covering factor on the shape of the incident spectrum and provides a self - consistent explanation of the data without invoking unusually large abundances .",

    "conversely , this model describes seyfert 2s and intermediate types ( i.e. , seyfert 1.8s and 1.9s ) as having their inner regions viewed preferentially edge - on so that the continuum source and broad line region are blocked by thick clouds . within the context of this model , the mean inclinations for the two types",
    "are predicted to be @xmath330@xmath16 and @xmath360@xmath16 for 1s and 2s , respectively .",
    "seyfert 1 galaxies appear to follow the expected trend , with a mean inclination angle of 30@xmath16 ( nandra et al .",
    "on the other hand , seyfert 2 galaxies may not follow the expected trend .",
    "t97 derive small angles of 13 to 33@xmath16 for four seyfert 1.9 and 2 galaxies , including mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 , and conclude that these objects have their inner regions preferentially seen face on , similar to seyfert 1s .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1 data imply that the disk in mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 is viewed edge - on .",
    "the 90% confidence range of inclinations inferred from fits with compton reflection models , 50@xmath16 to 81@xmath16 , is entirely consistent with the geometry of the nuclear region that is predicted by the unified model based on its seyfert 1.9 classification .",
    "clearly , @xmath1 provides valuable information that can be used to constrain the geometry and distribution of gas near the centers of active galaxies . comparing results in the literature ,",
    "we find that using @xmath5 data alone to derive disk inclinations from iron line profiles is ambiguous because there are many unknown parameters and the results depend crucially on the assumptions that go into the modeling .",
    "although an approximately face - on disk can be derived for certain techniques of modeling the @xmath5 data , this interpretation is not supported by the @xmath1 data , which instead favor large inclinations .",
    "using @xmath1 , we have detected the signature of compton reflection in the seyfert 1.9 galaxy mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 .",
    "we also confirm the broad fe k@xmath2 line seen with @xmath5 with fwhm @xmath3 48,000 km s@xmath4 .",
    "this measurement provides an independent confirmation of the broad line that is thought to be the signature of emission from the inner regions of an accretion disk orbiting a black hole . from spectral modeling , we derive a 90% confidence range for the disk inclination of 50@xmath7 , which is consistent with the inclination predicted from the unified model for mcg@xmath05 - 23 - 16 based on its seyfert 1.9 classification .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath2 line from the disk is at least @xmath3170 ev .",
    "this is much larger than that predicted for a highly inclined , neutral accretion disk unless we infer supersolar abundances , an unusually large covering factor of reflecting material , or the presence of a high - energy cutoff in the incident spectrum between @xmath360 and @xmath3200 kev .    we wish to thank keith jahoda for invaluable help with implementing and understanding the pca calibration .",
