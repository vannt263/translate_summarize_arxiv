    "or energy efficient wireless communication has recently drawn significant attention due to the growing concerns about the operator s cost as well as the global environmental cost of using fossil fuel based energy to power cellular infrastructures @xcite . to achieve the optimal energy usage efficiency for cellular networks , various innovative `` green '' techniques across different layers of communication protocol stacks",
    "have been proposed @xcite . among others , how to maximize the bits - per - joule _ energy efficiency _ ( ee ) for the point - to - point wireless link has received a great deal of interest recently @xcite .",
    "= 1   ( the left sub - figure ) and the non - ideal circuit power case of @xmath0 ( the right sub - figure).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    besides maximizing ee , another key design objective in wireless communication is to maximize the _ spectrum efficiency _ ( se ) or the number of transmitted bits - per - second - per - hz ( bps / hz ) , due to the explosive growth of wireless devices and applications that require high data rates . in order to design wireless communication systems both energy and spectrum efficiently , the fundamental ee - se relationship needs to be examined carefully . for the simple additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel with bandwidth @xmath1 and noise power spectral density @xmath2 , by applying the shannon s capacity formula , the se and ee are expressed as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively , with @xmath5 denoting the transmit power .",
    "it thus follows that the optimal ee - se tradeoff is characterized by @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8 , as shown in the left sub - figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : eese ] . in this case , any se increment will inevitably result in a decrement in ee .",
    "however , in practical wireless transmitters , besides the direct transmit power @xmath5 , there also exists _ non - ideal _ circuit power consumed when @xmath9 , which accounts for the power consumptions at e.g. the ac / dc converter and the analog radio frequency ( rf ) amplifier , and amounts to a significant part of the total consumed power at the transmitter .",
    "moreover , when there is no data transmission , i.e. , @xmath10 , the transmitter can turn into a _ micro - sleep _",
    "mode @xcite , by switching off the power amplifier to reduce the circuit power consumption .",
    "for the ease of description , in this paper the transmitter status with @xmath9 and @xmath10 are referred to as the _ on _ and _ off _ modes , respectively .",
    "denote the non - ideal circuit power during an `` on '' mode as @xmath11 in watt , the efficiency of the rf chain as @xmath12 , and the power consumed during an `` off '' mode as @xmath13 in watt . a practical power consumption model for the wireless transmitter",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the total power consumed at the transmitter .",
    "in practice , @xmath16 is generally much smaller as compared to @xmath17 and thus can be ignored for simplicity @xcite . in this paper",

    "therefore , in ( [ eq1 ] ) without loss of generality we can further assume @xmath19 since @xmath20 is only a scaling constant . by appropriately scaling the obtained solutions .",
    "] with the above simplifications , the ee can be re - expressed as @xmath21 for @xmath9 and the resulting new ee - se tradeoff is shown in the right sub - figure of fig . [",
    "fig : eese ] for a given @xmath22 , from which it is observed that the non - ideal circuit power drastically changes the behavior of the ee - se tradeoff as compared to the ideal case of @xmath23 .",
    "recently , a new design paradigm for achieving green wireless communication has drawn a great deal of attention , in which wireless terminals are powered primarily or even solely by harvesting the energy from environmental sources such as solar and wind , thereby reducing substantially the energy cost in traditional wireless systems @xcite . with the embedded energy harvesting device and rechargeable battery",
    ", wireless transmitters can replenish energy from the environment without the need of replacing battery or drawing power from the main grid .",
    "thus , communication utilizing energy harvesting nodes can promisingly achieve a jointly spectrum and energy efficiency maximization goal . however , there are new challenges in designing energy harvesting powered wireless communication , which are not present in traditional systems . for example",
    ", the intermittent nature of most practical energy harvesting sources causes random power availability at the transmitter , due to which a new type of transmitter - side power constraint , namely _ energy harvesting constraint _",
    ", is imposed , i.e. , the energy accumulatively consumed up to any time can not exceed that accumulatively harvested . as a result ,",
    "existing ee - se tradeoffs ( cf . fig .",
    "[ fig : eese ] ) revealed for conventional wireless systems assuming a given constant power supply are not directly applicable to an energy harvesting system , with or without the non - ideal circuit power .",
    "it is worth noting that some prior work in the literature has investigated the throughput - optimal power control policies for the energy harvesting wireless transmitter assuming an ideal circuit - power model ( i.e. , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 in ( [ eq1 ] ) ) , in which useful structural properties of the optimal solution were obtained ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , there is very limited work on studying the effects of the non - ideal circuit power with @xmath22 on the throughput - optimal power allocation for energy harvesting communication systems .",
    "to our best knowledge , only @xcite has proposed a calculus - based approach to address this problem ; however , it does not reveal the structure of the optimal solution .",
    "motivated by the known result that the non - ideal circuit power modifies the ee - se tradeoff considerably in the conventional case with constant power supply as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eese ] , we expect that it should also play an important role in the ee - se tradeoff characterization under the new setup with random power supply due to energy harvesting , which motivates our work .    in this paper , we study the throughput maximization problem for a point - to - point awgn channel with an energy harvesting powered transmitter over a finite horizon .",
    "for the purpose of exposition , we assume that the receiver has a constant power supply ( e.g. battery ) .",
    "we also assume that at the transmitter , the renewable energy arrives at a discrete set of time instants with variable energy amount . under this setup , we investigate the effects of the non - ideal circuit power with @xmath22 on the throughput - optimal power allocation as well as the resulting new ee - se tradeoff .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows .",
    "* first , we consider the _ off - line _ optimization under the assumption that the energy arrival time and amount for harvesting are _ a priori _ known at the transmitter .",
    "we show that the optimal power allocation to maximize the average throughput under this setup is a _ non - convex _ optimization problem , due to the non - ideal circuit power .",
    "nevertheless , we derive an efficient optimal solution for this problem , which is shown to correspond to a novel _ two - phase _ transmission structure : the first phase with an _ ee - maximizing _ on - off power allocation , and the second phase with a _ se - maximizing _ power allocation that is non - decreasing over time .",
    "thus , we reveal an interesting result that both the ee and se optimizations are unified in an energy harvesting powered wireless system .",
    "* we then extend the optimal off - line policy for the single - channel case to the general case with multiple parallel awgn channels , subject to a total energy harvesting power constraint . using tools from _ nested optimization _ , we transform this problem with multi - dimensional ( vector ) power optimization to an equivalent one with only one - dimensional ( scalar ) power optimization , which can then be efficiently solved by the algorithm derived for the single - channel case . * furthermore , inspired by the off - line optimal solution , we propose a heuristic _ online _ algorithm under the practical setup where only the causal ( past and present ) energy state information ( esi ) for harvesting is assumed to be known at the transmitter .",
    "it is shown by simulations that the proposed online algorithm achieves a small performance gap from the throughput upper bound by the optimal off - line solution , and also outperforms other heuristically designed online algorithms .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : system model ] introduces the system model and presents the problem formulation .",
    "section [ sec : offline ] derives the optimal off - line power allocation policy for the single - channel case .",

    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "in this paper , we consider the point - to - point transmission over an awgn channel with constant channel and coherent detection at the receiver . the transmitter is assumed to replenish energy from an energy harvesting device that collects energy over time from a renewable source ( e.g. solar or wind ) .",
    "we consider the block - based energy scheduling with each block spanning over @xmath26 seconds ( secs ) .",
    "we assume that the renewable energy arrives during each block at @xmath27 time instants given by @xmath28 , and the energy values collected at these time instants are denoted by @xmath29 , respectively . in general , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , @xmath33",
    ", are modeled by an appropriate random process for the given energy source . for convenience ,",
    "we assume @xmath34 and denote @xmath35 as the initial energy stored in the energy storage device at the beginning time of each block . for the purpose of exposition",
    ", we assume that the energy storage device has an infinite capacity in this paper . moreover",
    ", we refer to the time interval between two consecutive energy arrivals as an _ epoch _ , and denote the length of the @xmath36th epoch as @xmath37 ; for convenience , we denote @xmath38 .",
    "suppose that the transmit power over time in each block is denoted by @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "assume that the maximum transmission rate that can be reliably decoded at the receiver at any time @xmath40 is a function of @xmath41 , given by @xmath42 , which satisfies the following properties :    1 .",

    "@xmath46 is a strictly concave function over @xmath47 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath46 is a monotonically increasing function over @xmath47 .",
    "for example , if adaptive modulation and coding ( amc ) is applied at the transmitter , then the achievable rate @xmath48 is denoted by @xcite @xmath49 in bits - per - sec ( bps ) , where @xmath50 accounts for the gap from the channel capacity due to a practical coding and modulation scheme used ; @xmath51 denotes the constant channel power gain .    as discussed in section [ sec : introduction ] , we assume an on - off transmitter power model given in ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath18 and @xmath52 ; thus , we rewrite ( [ eq1 ] ) as @xmath53    since the accumulatively consumed energy up to any time at the transmitter can not exceed the energy accumulatively harvested , the energy harvesting constraint on the total consumed power is given by @xmath54 thus , the throughput maximization problem over a finite horizon @xmath26 can be formulated as follows .",
    "@xmath55    the optimal online solution for the above problem with the causal esi , i.e. , for any given @xmath40 , only @xmath56 s with @xmath57 are known at the transmitter , can be numerically solved by the technique of dynamic programming similar to @xcite .",
    "however , such a solution is of high computational complexity due to `` the curse of dimensionality '' for dynamic programming . in addition",
    ", the resulting solution will not provide any insight to the structure of the optimal power allocation for an energy harvesting transmitter .",

    "the problem is in general non - convex and thus can not be solved by standard convex optimization techniques . in the next section , we will propose an efficient solution for this problem by exploiting its special structure .",
    "it is worth noting that for the off - line optimization , ( [ eq105 ] ) can be shown to be convex if @xmath23 . in this case ,",
    "similar problems to ( [ eq105 ] ) have been studied in the literature @xcite , in which the throughput - optimal power allocation @xmath41 was shown to follow a non - decreasing piecewise - constant ( staircase ) function over @xmath40 .",
    "this power allocation can be interpreted as maximizing the se of the point - to - point awgn channel subject to the new energy harvesting power constraint .",

    "thus , if this value is less than the ee - maximizing power allocation @xmath79 , the transmitter should transmit with @xmath79 to save energy ; however , if the inequality is reversed , the transmitter should transmit more power to maximize the se .",
    "moreover , as compared to the optimal off - line power allocation for the single - epoch case given in proposition [ proposition:1 ] , we see that the online policy ( [ online:5 ] ) bears a similar structure , by noting that @xmath198 in ( [ sinepoch:2 ] ) for the single - epoch case is also the available transmit power for the remaining time in each block .",
    "last , it is worth remarking that the online power allocation policy in ( [ online:5 ] ) is expressed as a function of the continuous time for convenience ; however , in practice , this policy needs to be implemented in discrete time steps by properly quantizing the continuous - time function .",
    "the time step needs to be carefully chosen in implementation : on one hand , it is desirable to use smaller step values to achieve higher quantization accuracy for energy saving , while on the other hand , the time step needs to be sufficiently large , i.e. , at least larger than one communication block ( cf .",
    "remark [ remark:3.1 ] ) so that the receiver can have a timely estimate of any transmit power adjustment .",

    "[ fig : online ] , we show the total transmitter power consumption by the proposed online policy assuming that the exact average harvested power @xmath199mw is known at the transmitter .",
    "it is observed that the online power allocation is no more piecewise - constant like the optimal off - line power allocation in fig .",
    "[ fig : offline](a ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is also observed that these two policies result in some similar power allocation patterns , i.e. , starting with an on - off power allocation followed by a non - decreasing ( in the sense of average power profile for the online policy case ) power allocation .",
    "this suggests that the proposed online policy captures the essential features of the optimal off - line policy .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that the proposed online policy achieves the total throughput 61.61mbits over @xmath130secs , which is only 1.53mbits from 63.14mbits of the optimal off - line policy .",
    "in addition , it can be verified that the total throughput obtained by the proposed online policy is very robust to the assumed average harvested power value @xmath200 .",
    "for example , by setting @xmath201 to be 150mw or 200mw , the proposed online policy obtains the throughput 61.38mbits and 61.60mbits , respectively , which is a very small loss in either case .",
    "in the section , we compare the performance of the proposed online policy with the performance upper bound achieved by the optimal off - line policy under a stochastic energy harvesting setup modeled by the compound poisson process .",

    "moreover , enp is observed to obtain a similar performance as the proposed online policy .",
