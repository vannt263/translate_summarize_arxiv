    "the experiments with solar , atmospheric , reactor and accelerator neutrinos have provided compelling evidence for the existence of neutrino oscillations driven by nonzero neutrino masses and neutrino mixing ( see recent reviews @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these results are impressive proof that neutrinos have a nonzero mass .",
    "however , the experiments studying neutrino oscillations are not sensitive to the nature of the neutrino mass ( dirac or majorana ) and provide no information on the absolute scale of the neutrino masses , since such experiments are sensitive only to the difference of the masses , @xmath12 . the detection and study of neutrinoless double beta ( @xmath13 ) decay may clarify the following problems of neutrino physics ( see discussions in @xcite : ( i ) neutrino nature : whether the neutrino is a dirac or a majorana particle , ( ii ) absolute neutrino mass scale ( a measurement or a limit on @xmath14 ) , ( iii ) the type of neutrino mass hierarchy ( normal , inverted , or quasidegenerate ) , ( iv ) cp violation in the lepton sector ( measurement of the majorana cp - violating phases ) .    double beta decay with the emission of two neutrinos @xmath15 is an allowed process of second order in the standard model .",
    "the @xmath16 decays provide the possibility of an experimental determination of the nuclear matrix elements ( nme ) involved in the double beta decay processes .",
    "this leads to the development of theoretical schemes for nme calculations both in connection with the @xmath16 decays as well as the @xmath13 decays ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "at present , @xmath16 decay to the ground state of the final daughter nucleus has been measured for ten nuclei : @xmath17ca , @xmath18ge , @xmath19se , @xmath20zr , @xmath21mo , @xmath22cd , @xmath23te , @xmath24te , @xmath0nd and @xmath25u ( a review of the results is given in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath26 decay can proceed through transitions to the ground state as well as to various excited states of the daughter nucleus .",
    "studies of the latter transitions allow one to obtain supplementary information about @xmath26 decay .",
    "because of smaller transition energies , the probabilities for @xmath26-decay transitions to excited states are substantially suppressed in comparison with transitions to the ground state . but as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using low - background facilities utilizing high purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors , the @xmath16 decay to the @xmath27 level in the daughter nucleus may be detected for such nuclei as @xmath21mo , @xmath20zr , and @xmath0nd .",
    "for these isotopes the energies involved in the @xmath26 transitions are large ( 1903 , 2202 , and 2627  kev , respectively ) , and the expected half - lives are of the order of @xmath28  y. the required sensitivity was reached for @xmath21mo in four independent experiments  @xcite .",
    "it was also obtained in @xmath0nd  @xcite .",
    "recently additional isotopes ( @xmath19se , @xmath24te , @xmath22cd , and @xmath18ge ) have also become of interest to studies of the @xmath16 decay to the @xmath27 level ( see reviews in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the @xmath13 transition to excited states of daughter nuclei provide a clear - cut signature of such decays , and is worthy of a special note here .",
    "in addition to two electrons with fixed total energy , one ( @xmath29 transition ) or two ( @xmath30 transition ) photons appear , with their energies being strictly fixed . in a hypothetical experiment detecting all decay products with a high efficiency and a high energy resolution , the background can be reduced to nearly zero .",
    "this zero background idea will be the goal of future experiments featuring a large mass of the @xmath26 sample ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was mentioned that detection of this transition will give us the additional possibility of distinguishing the @xmath13 mechanisms ( the light and heavy majorana neutrino exchange mechanisms , the trilinear r - parity breaking mechanisms etc . ) .",
    "so the search for @xmath26 transitions to the excited states has its own special interest .    in this article ,",
    "results of an experimental investigation of the @xmath26 decay of @xmath0nd and @xmath1nd to the excited states in @xmath0sm and @xmath1sm are presented .",

    "in addition , the passive shielding was enclosed in an aluminum box flushed with high - purity nitrogen .",
    "the electronics consisted of currently available spectrometric amplifiers and a 8192 channel adc . the energy calibration was adjusted to cover the energy range from 50 kev to 3.5 mev , and the energy resolution was 2.0 kev for the 1332-kev line of @xmath35co .",

    "however we believe that we detected only the @xmath16 decay .",
    "this conclusion is supported by two arguments .",

    "second , the experimental limit for the @xmath13 decay of @xmath0nd to the ground 0@xmath73 state of @xmath0sm is about two orders of magnitude larger @xcite than the value reported here . therefore , considering the reduced phase space factors available for the transition to the excited 0@xmath5 state",
    ", it is safe to assume that our result for @xmath74 refers solely to the @xmath16 decay . as to the possible contribution of @xmath75 decay to the @xmath76 excited state to the peak at 333.9 kev",
    "one can conclude that this contribution is small .",
    "first , the experimental limit on neutrinoless mode ( @xmath77 y @xcite ) is much stronger than the obtained `` positive '' result for the decay of @xmath0nd to the 0@xmath5 excited state of @xmath0sm . and second",
    ", the theoretical prediction for two neutrino mode ( @xmath78 y @xcite ) is very far from the observed value .    using the phase space factor value g = @xmath79 ( for g@xmath80 = 1.254 ) @xcite and the measured half - life @xmath57\\cdot 10^{20}$ ] y , one obtains a nme value for the @xmath16 transition to the 0@xmath5 excited state of @xmath81(0@xmath5 ) = @xmath82 ( scaled by the electron rest mass ) .",
    "one can compare this value with the nme value for the @xmath16 transition to the ground state of @xmath0sm , @xmath81(0@xmath83 ) = 0.033@xmath84 ( here we used the average half - life value @xmath85 y from @xcite and g = @xmath86 ( for g@xmath80 = 1.254 ) from @xcite ) .",
    "one can see that @xmath81(0@xmath87 is @xmath88 25% greater than @xmath81(0@xmath5 ) .",
    "nevertheless , these values are very close and taking into account errors and possible uncertainties their equality can not be excluded . from the viewpoint of the theory it is important to confirm this difference or to rule it out .",
    "future more precise measurements for both transitions and especially for the transition to the excited state are needed .    for double beta decay of @xmath0nd to the 2@xmath5 , 2@xmath8 , and 0@xmath8 excited states of @xmath0sm the limits obtained are @xmath88 2 - 5 times better than the best previous results @xcite .",
    "the limit obtained for the transition to the 2@xmath9 excited state is 200 times better than the previous limit @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1nd limit for the transition to the 0@xmath5 excited state was obtained for the first time and for transitions to 2@xmath5 and 2@xmath8 states a sensitivity was achieved that is @xmath88 200 times better than in ref . @xcite .",
    "double beta decay of @xmath0nd and @xmath1nd to the excited states of daughter nuclei was investigated with a high level of sensitivity .",
    "the half - life for the @xmath16 decay of @xmath0nd to the excited 0@xmath5 state in @xmath0sm is measured to be @xmath6\\cdot 10^{20}$ ] y. the strongest limits for other transitions were established .",
    "the sensitivity of this experiment could still be increased by a few times using a pure nd@xmath3o@xmath4 ( or nd ) sample .",
    "also further increases in the sensitivity could be reached using an enriched nd sample and a multicrystal hpge installation to study larger masses of nd samples .",
