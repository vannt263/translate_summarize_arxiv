    "establishing that two light - curves , measured in different energy bands , are correlated with each other is an important temporal diagnostic for various kinds of astrophysical sources , especially for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries .",
    "the detection and measurement of the level of correlation constrains the number of radiative processes active in the source and can be used to validate ( or rule out ) models based on spectral analysis . phase and time - lags detected for correlated light - curves can provide further insight into the geometry and size of the emitting region . often in these applications ,",
    "the light curves available for analysis are of short duration and have measurement errors .",
    "the true temporal behaviour of a source can only be established if there are robust estimates of the errors on the cross - correlation , phase and time - lags .",
    "it is important to emphasize that a cross - correlation analysis between two finite length light - curves will not provide an accurate measure of the correlation between them , even in the absence of measurement errors .",
    "intrinsic stochastic fluctuations in the light curves will induce an error on the cross - correlation measured .",
    "an estimate of the significance and error of the cross - correlation detected , should take into account both , measurement errors as well as statistical fluctuations .",
    "the standard method to estimate the error on the cross - correlation involves dividing the light curves into several equal segments and finding the cross - correlation for each .",
    "then the net cross - correlation is given by the average of the different segments and the variance is quoted as an error .",
    "for example , this technique is implemented by the function `` crosscor '' of the high energy astrophysics software _ heasoft_.",
    "the method is reliable only if the light curves can be divided into a large number of segments ( @xmath2 ) and each segment is sufficiently long and not dominated by measurement errors .",
    "the temporal behaviour of many astrophysical systems depends on the time - scales of the analysis and hence by using this method , one loses information on the behaviour of the system on time - scales comparable to the length of the original data . in agn ,",
    "the time scale involved is long comparable to the length of observation in many cases , hence it is not practical to divide the light curve in segments .",
    "moreover , there does not seem to be any established way by which this method can be extended to get an estimate of the time - lag between the light curves and its error .",
    "these deficiencies can be overcome by using a monte carlo technique where one simulates a large number of pairs of light curves having the same _ assumed _ temporal properties and with the same measurement errors as the original pair .",
    "the results of the original pair can be compared with the simulated ones to ascertain the confidence level of the cross - correlation and time - lag .",
    "the simulated light curves should take into account the stochastic fluctuations of the light curves and not just the measurements errors .",
    "indeed , when the light curve is sampled unevenly and with measurement errors changing in time , the monte carlo technique may be the only way to obtain reliable estimates ( for e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "monte carlo technique is numerically expensive and hence are not practical for analysis of a large sets of data . more importantly ,",
    "the results depend on the subjectivity of the assumed temporal properties of the system .",
    "for example , to ascertain the errors on an observed cross - correlation and time - lag value , the simulations are generally done with the assumption that these are the true intrinsic values .",
    "similar assumptions have to be made on the shape of the power spectra of the light curves .    as pointed out and discussed extensively by @xcite , an analytical estimate of the variance on cross - correlation",
    "is not straight forward . in the literature",
    ", there is an analytical estimate for the cross - correlation known as bartlett s equation @xcite which is not often used in astronomical contexts .",
    "this method is available in the `` crosscorrelation '' function in the imsl numerical libraries .",
    "the error is accurate only when the complete knowledge of the cross - correlation and auto - correlation functions are available .",
    "its effectiveness for short duration light curves is uncertain .",
    "moreover , this error estimate does not naturally translate into error estimates for the phase and time lag between the light curves .",
    "complete information regarding the temporal relation between two light curves can be obtained by computing the coherence and time - lag as a function of fourier frequency .",
    "a detailed description of the technique as well as physical interpretation is given by @xcite .",
    "the two light curves are divided into many segments and for each segment a fourier transform is undertaken and coherence and phase lag as a function of frequency is estimated .",
    "for the different segments , the coherence and phase lags are averaged and their errors can be estimated analytically .",
    "such detailed information can only be obtained for long light curves which can be split into several segments . in the absence of such rich data ,",
    "statistically significant results can be obtained by averaging over fourier frequencies .",
    "indeed , from this view point the cross - correlation , is in some sense , the average of the coherence over all frequencies .",
    "however , computing the error on the cross - correlation using the error estimates for the coherence is not straight forward .",
    "first , the averaging has to be appropriately weighted by the power in each frequency bin .",
    "secondly , the error estimate for the coherence is reliable only if the error itself is small , which is the case when many segments are averaged and not necessarily true for the coherence at a single frequency bin obtained from a single segment .    in this work , we present an analytical estimate for the cross - correlation between two light curves .",
    "the error estimate is based on the fourier transforms of the light curves and is based on the correct averaging over different frequency modes . in  2 ,",
    "the estimate is derived and verified by simulations with and without measurement errors .",
    " 3 highlights the difficulties in estimating a time - lag and its error using the standard method of finding the peak of the cross - correlation function .",
    "the cross - correlation phasor is introduced in  4 which leads to an estimate of the phase lag between the light curves . in the same section ,",
    "a technique is introduced by which one can measure the time lag and its error . in this method",
    "the time - lag measured can be even smaller than the sampling time bin of the light curves .",
    "the complete fully self contained algorithm is presented in  5 for easy reference . as an example , in  6 , the technique is applied to the _ xmm - newton _ light curves of the highly variable and well studied agn , akn  564 . in  7 ,",
    "the summary and discussion includes a list of important assumptions on which the technique is based and provides examples when the assumptions may not be valid .",
    "we first consider an idealised case of two light curves without measurement errors .",
    "the two light curves are assumed to be recorded in @xmath3 discrete equally spaced time intervals , @xmath4 and the mean is subtracted from each of them .",
    "it is assumed that they are partially linearly dependent such that , @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are time - series produced by two independent stochastic processes .",
    "each time series can be conveniently represented by its discrete fourier transform , @xmath8 , defined as @xmath9 and a power estimate @xmath10 can be obtained . for a stationary system ,",
    "the ensemble average ( i.e. average of an infinite number of realisations ) of the power , @xmath11 , is a characteristic of the stochastic process .",
    "a power derived from a single time series , @xmath12 is only an estimator of its value .",
    "in particular the real and imaginary parts of @xmath13 vary independently can be derived from two independent gaussian distributions @xcite .",
    "the deviation of @xmath12 from @xmath11 is roughly equal to @xmath14 i.e. the power estimate from a single light curve has nearly 100% error .",
    "the variance @xmath15 is again an estimate of the ensemble averaged variance @xmath16 .",
    "one can define the cross - correlation estimate of the two time series as @xmath17 where @xmath18 here @xmath19 and @xmath20 are discrete fourier transforms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively and @xmath23 their ensemble averages are @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 has the useful property that its ensemble average @xmath28 is zero if the two light series are uncorrelated ( i.e. @xmath29 ) and unity if they are completely correlated ( i.e. when @xmath30 ) .",
    "however , @xmath27 is only a measure of @xmath31 and the deviation between them needs to be quantified .",
    "the average deviation of @xmath32 from @xmath33 can be estimated to be ( appendix a : eqn [ deltacxyderv ] ) @xmath34 if one does not have _ a priori _ information about the stochastic process then @xmath35 and @xmath36 have to be estimated using the measured values , @xmath37    to ascertain whether there is a detectable correlation between the two light - curves ( i.e. @xmath38 ) it is first necessary to show that , at some confidence level , @xmath39 .",
    "one can define a null hypothesis sigma level @xmath40 and fix a criterion ( a prudent one being @xmath41 ) to ascertain whether any correlation has been detected .",
    "it is important to note that only if the criterion is satisfied should one proceed to estimate the degree of cross - correlation @xmath27 otherwise any such attempt will not only be incorrect but also meaningless .",
    "if @xmath32 is uncorrelated with @xmath42 , then @xmath43 where the variation in @xmath42 has been neglected . however , as discussed extensively by @xcite , @xmath44 is , in general , correlated with @xmath32 . in particular , @xmath45 depends on the variation of @xmath46 through the term @xmath47 .",
    "a possible solution is to define a transformation , @xmath48 whose terms are not correlated ( or at least not so correlated ) . then estimate the expected variation for that function , @xmath49 and use that to obtain an estimate for @xmath50 .",
    "below we describe such a transformation and subsequently test the results obtained from simulations .",
    "the transformation chosen for the analysis is @xmath51 where the subtraction of @xmath52 in the denominator may make it nearly independent of the numerator .",
    "the average deviation of @xmath53 can be estimated to be , @xmath54 where the variation of the denominator has been neglected .",
    "@xmath49 is related to @xmath50 by @xmath55 using eqns ( [ eqnp1 ] ) and ( [ eqnp2 ] ) one can obtain an estimate for the deviation of @xmath27 to be @xmath56 naturally , @xmath50 depends on ensemble averaged quantities which characterise the stochastic processes that have produced the light curves .",
    "typically , one does not have _ a priori _ information of the stochastic processes and the ensemble averaged quantities need to be estimated from the light curves .",
    "thus the best estimate of @xmath50 can be obtained by replacing these ensemble averaged quantities with the measured ones .",

    "these histograms , @xmath72 are normalised such that their summation @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the bin size . they are compared with a normalised gaussian distribution with a centroid value equal to the expected averaged cross - correlation of @xmath75 and with width @xmath76 equal to @xmath50 computed using eqn ( [ dcxy ] ) . as can be seen , the normalised gaussian distributions describe well the simulated results which validates the method and assumptions used to estimate @xmath50 in the previous subsection .",
    "however , in practical situations one has to use the approximation @xmath58 to estimate the variance which in general will vary for each pair of light curves .",
    "in the bottom panel of figure 1 , we plot histograms of deviation of @xmath27 from the average @xmath31 normalised by the estimated deviation @xmath77 i.e. @xmath78 . if @xmath58 is an accurate measure of the variation of @xmath27 then the distribution of the normalised variation should be a zero centred gaussian with @xmath64 .",
    "the plot verifies this prediction by comparing the distribution with such a gaussian shape .",
    "the distributions agree well with each other except for large @xmath79 , where the gaussian distribution is slightly broader than the simulation results .",

    "qualitatively the comparison between the expected and obtained distribution are similar to the @xmath61 case , except for some quantitative differences .",
    "for the same length of the light curves , @xmath50 is larger for @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath27 is by definition constrained to be less than unity , the distribution differs from the symmetric gaussian shape for large @xmath79 .",

    "the original light - curves may be divided into @xmath82 parts , and cross - correlations of each may be averaged . for @xmath61",
    "this will not lead to any change in the accuracy with the final @xmath50 being nearly the same .",
    "however , for @xmath65 , @xmath83 which would give a much better accuracy than finding the cross - correlation for the whole light - curve .",
    "however , such a cross - correlation will not have information about the behaviour of the system on timescales corresponding to duration of the original light curve .    for simplicity ,",
    "the simulations undertaken here are for the case when both the uncorrelated light curves @xmath6 and @xmath7 arise from stochastic processes having the same power spectral shape i.e. @xmath84 .",
    "however , the results obtained are general and are also true when the spectral shapes are different .",
    "we next consider a more realistic case , where the light - curves have measurement errors .",

    ", title=\"fig : \" ]    to test and validate the effectiveness of the scheme , we analyse the lightcurve of a well studied active galactic nucleus , akn  564 .",
    "the temporal and spectral properties of the source was studied using an _ xmm - newton _ observation of the source by @xcite .",
    "they computed the cross - correlation function for different energy bands and estimated a possible time - lag between the hard and soft bands to be @xmath193 secs using the peak of the function as a measure . using monte carlo simulations they estimated an error on the time lag to be @xmath194 secs due to measurement error . @xcite and @xcite computed time - lags as function of frequency for _ asca _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations of the source and found that the there is a sharp drop in time lag for frequencies greater than @xmath195 hz .",
    "we extracted light curves of the source using the _ xmm - newton _ observation , in different energy bands .",
    "details of the extraction process are given in @xcite .",
    "the usable continuous time duration for the observation is for @xmath196 secs .",
    "our motivation here is not to analyse in detail the temporal properties of the source and their physical interpretation , but instead to show as an example and validate the method described in this work .",
    "thus , while finer time binning of the data is possible , we restrict our analysis to @xmath197 sec bins , which resulted in light curves with length @xmath198 .",
    "figure [ figakn1 ] shows the results of our analysis .",
    "note that the cross - correlation , phase and time - lag are well constrained as a function of energy .",
    "figure [ figakn2 ] shows the results of the analysis when the light curves were divided into ten segments and the results averaged as described in the last section .",
    "note that again the physical quantities are well constrained and while the phase difference is relatively unchanged between the two analysis , the time - lag decreases by nearly an order of magnitude .",
    "this is consistent with earlier results that the time - lag decreases with increasing fourier frequency .",
    "splitting the lightcurve into segments and taking the average assumes that the during the time - scale , the source was stationary .",
    "this can be now explicitly tested using the analytical error estimates for each segment .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig [ figakn3 ] , where for each ten segments , the r.m.s , cross - correlations and phase - lags ( between the energy bands @xmath188-@xmath105 and @xmath105-@xmath190 kev ) are shown .",
    "the cross - correlations and phase lags are consistent with being a constant equal to the averaged value ( shown as a dashed line ) .",
    "formally the @xmath199 for the data points to be constant are @xmath200 and @xmath201 for the cross - correlation and phase lag respectively . the slightly lower value of @xmath202 than expected indicates only a slight overestimation of the error bars , especially for the phase lags .",
    "this is probably because for each segment , the error on the phase lag @xmath132 is large and hence the error distribution maybe slightly different than a gaussian .",
    "nevertheless , the figure clearly shows that not only can stationarity be tested but also reconfirms that the error estimates are reliable .",
    "perhaps , not surprisingly , given the shape of the total light curve , the r.m.s of the @xmath105-@xmath190 kev energy band is formally not consistent with being a constant , with a @xmath203 .",
    "this is primarily due to the fifth segment where the r.m.s and its error is small .",
    "note that the error is computed by assuming that the power spectrum of the segment is representative of the ensemble average .",
    "perhaps a more prudent approach would be to estimate the error on the r.m.s using the averaged power spectrum rather than for each individual segment",
    ". however , whether such deviations are a significant indication of departure from stationarity is arguable and subjective .",
    "hence , we recommend that only large deviations ( for e.g. @xmath204 ) should be taken as serious evidence for non - stationarity .",
    "an analytical estimate for the significance and error on the cross - correlation , phase and time lag between two light curves is presented .",
    "the error estimates take into account the stochastic fluctuations of the lightcurve as well as any known measurement errors .",
    "the technique has been verified using simulations of light curves generated from both white and @xmath1 stochastic processes with and without intrinsic correlation between them .",
    "the entire analysis consists of five algorithmic steps which are described in  6 .",
    "the technique is ideally suited for short light curves of length @xmath205 and is an improvement over earlier methods which were based on numerically expensive simulations or by dividing the data into number of segments to find the variance .",
    "the analytical estimate presented is based on several assumptions and hence is reliable only when they are valid .",
    "we emphasize this point by enumerating some of the main assumptions .",
    "@xmath206 both the light curves have been generated from stochastic processes .",
    "technically , this means that the phase of the different fourier components are unrelated to each other i.e. @xmath207 .",
    "this assumption will be violated if the generation mechanism is a non - linear one . in general , it is difficult to ascertain the degree of non - linearity in a short lightcurve and it requires sensitive analysis like bi - coherence measure and/or non - linear time series analysis .",
    "thus , in most cases , the stochastic nature of the light curves have to be assumed .",
    "it is prudent to be aware that this assumption has been made and its validity is unknown , like for example , for the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts .",
    "a simple case where this assumption will be violated is if the power spectra have dominant harmonic features , where the power in the harmonics is comparable to that of the primary .",
    "@xmath206 the measurement errors are uncorrelated and have gaussian distributions .",
    "the essential assumption is that the power spectrum of the measurement errors is independent of frequency ( i.e. a white noise ) and their phases are independent of each other . if the power spectrum has a different shape , then the appropriate changes have to be made and the basic results of this work need to be re - derived . for most practical purposes if the measurement errors are known , they usually are gaussian distributions and hence this assumption is valid . if there are unknown systematic errors in the light curves then of course the analysis will not be applicable .",
    "poisson distributions have the white noise property but in general the phases of the different fourier components may be related .",
    "we have verified that for counts per time bin @xmath106 , the results of this analysis is valid . for counts less than that ,",
    "caution is advised . however , for such low counts , meaningful results can only be obtained for long time series and it may better to obtain frequency dependent coherence and lag measurements .    @xmath206 the light curves are evenly sampled without gaps . for unevenly sampled data",
    "the cross - correlation can be estimated @xcite , but there does not seem to be an analytical way to estimate the significance and error .",
    "one needs to use either monte carlo simulations or more practically estimate the error by dividing the light curves into several segments and finding their variance .",
    "@xmath206 the light curves are stationary .",
    "as shown in the example of the light curves of akn  564 , this assumption can be tested by dividing the light curves into segments and checking whether the r.m.s , cross - correlation and phase lags are consistent to be a constant for different segments .    while this technique is useful for short duration light curves , coherence and frequency dependent time lags provide naturally more information and should be preferentially computed for long data streams .",
    "this technique may not be unique or optimal and hence there is a possibility and need for development of better methods provided they give robust and physically interpretable results .",
    "finally , while cross - correlation , phase and time lags provide a quantitative measure of the system , their physical interpretation has to be done in terms of the physical geometrical and radiative model assumed for the system .",
