    "it has been known that entanglement can be detected with help of special class of maps called positive maps @xcite .",
    "in particular there is an important criterion @xcite saying that @xmath0 acting on a given product hilbert space @xmath1 is separable if and only if for all positive ( but not completely positive ) maps @xmath2 @xcite the following operator @xmath3(\\varrho)\\ ] ] has all non - negative eigenvalues which usually is written as @xmath4(\\varrho ) \\geq 0 \\label{positivemaps1}.\\ ] ] here by @xmath5 we denote the identity map acting on @xmath6",
    ". since any positivity - preserving map is also hermiticity - preserving , it makes sense to speak about eigenvalues of @xmath7 .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that there are many @xmath8s ( and equivalently the corresponding criteria ) and to characterize them is a hard and still unsolved problem ( see , e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .    for a long time",
    "the above criterion has been treated as purely mathematical .",
    "one used to take matrix @xmath0 ( obtained in some _ prior _ state estimation procedure ) and then put it into the formula ( [ positivemaps1 ] ) .",
    "then its spectrum was calculated and the conclusion was drawn",
    ". however it can be seen that for , say states acting on @xmath9 and maps @xmath10 , the spectrum of the operator @xmath7 consists of @xmath11 elements , while full _ prior _ estimation of such states corresponds to @xmath12 parameters .",
    "the question was raised @xcite as to whether one can perform the test ( [ positivemaps1 ] ) physically without necessity of _ prior _ tomography of the state @xmath0 despite the fact that the map @xmath13 is not physically realizable .",
    "the corresponding answer was @xcite that one can use the notion of structural physical approximation @xmath14 ( spa ) of un  physical map @xmath15 which is physically realizable already , but at the same time the spectrum of the state @xmath16(\\varrho)\\ ] ] is just an affine transformation of that of the ( unphysical ) operator @xmath7 .",
    "the spectrum of @xmath17 can be measured with help of the spectrum estimator @xcite , which requires estimation of only @xmath18 parameters which ( because of affinity ) are in one to one correspondence with the needed spectrum of ( [ positivemaps1 ] ) .",
    "note that for @xmath19 systems ( the composite system of two qubits ) , similar approaches lead to the method of detection of entanglement measures ( concurrence @xcite and entanglement of formation @xcite ) without the state reconstruction @xcite .",
    "the disadvantage of the above method is @xcite that realization of spa requires addition the noise to the system ( we have to put some controlled ancillas , couple the system , and then trace them out ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the question was raised about the existence of noiseless quantum networks , i.e. , those of which the only input data are : ( i ) unknown quantum information represented by @xmath20 ( ii ) the controlled measured qubit which reproduces us the spectrum moments ( see ref .",
    "it was shown that for at least one positive map ( transposition ) @xmath21 the noiseless network exists @xcite .",
    "such networks for two - qubit concurrence and three - qubit tangle have also been designed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we ask a general question : do noiseless networks work only for special maps ( functions ) or do they exist for any positive map test ? in the case of a positive answer to the latter : is it possible to design a general method for constructing them ? can it be adopted to any criteria other than the one defined in ( [ positivemaps1 ] ) ?    for this purpose",
    "we first show how to measure a spectrum of the matrix @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is an arbitrary linear , hermiticity - preserving map and @xmath0 is a given density operator acting on @xmath24 , with the help of only @xmath25 parameters estimated instead of @xmath26 . for bipartite @xmath0 where @xmath27",
    "this gives @xmath18 instead of @xmath28 .",
    "this approach is consistent with previous results @xcite where arbitrary polynomials of elements of a given state @xmath0 have been considered . in these works",
    "it was shown out that any at most @xmath29-th degree polynomial of a density matrix @xmath0 can be measured with help of two collective observables on @xmath29 copies of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact one can treat the moments of @xmath22 which we analyze below as polynomials belonging to such a class .",
    "we derive the explicit form of observables for the sake of possible future application .",
    "moreover , approach presented in the present paper allows for quite natural identification of observable that detects an arbitrary polynomial of the state @xmath0 subjected to some transformation @xmath30 .",
    "then we provide an immediate application in entanglement detection showing that for suitable @xmath30 the scheme constitutes just a right method for detecting entanglement without prior state reconstruction with the help of either positive map criteria ( [ positivemaps1 ] ) or linear contraction methods discussed later .",
    "since @xmath31 matrix @xmath22 is hermitian its spectrum may be calculated using only @xmath25 numbers @xmath32^{k}=\\sum_{i=1}^{m}\\lambda_{i}^{k}\\qquad ( k=1,\\ldots , m),\\ ] ] where @xmath33 are eigenvalues of @xmath22 .",
    "we shall show that all these spectrum moments can be represented by mean values of special observables . to this aim",
    "let us consider the permutation operator @xmath34 defined by the formula @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are vectors from @xmath24 .",

    "this , together with the observation of refs .",
    "@xcite allows us already to construct a single collective observable that detects @xmath40 .",
    "however , for the sake of possible future applications we derive the observable explicitly below . to this aim",
    "we first notice that @xmath40 may be obtained using hermitian conjugation of @xmath34 which again is a permutation operator but permutes states @xmath37 in the reversed order .",
    "therefore all the numbers @xmath40 may be expressed as @xmath42.\\ ] ] let us focus for a while on the map @xmath30 . due to its hermiticity - preserving property",
    "it may be expressed as @xmath43 with @xmath44 and @xmath45 being linearly independent @xmath25-by-@xmath25 matrices . by the virtue of this fact and some well - known properties of the trace , after rather straightforward algebra",

    "this apparently purely mathematical trick with the aid of the fact that the square brackets in the above contain a hermitian operator allows us to express the numbers @xmath40 as a mean value of some observables in the state @xmath53 . indeed , introducing @xmath54\\ ] ]",
    "we arrive at @xmath55 .",

    "but there is a possibility of building a unitary network that requires estimation of exactly @xmath25 parameters using the idea that we recall and refine below .",
    "finally , let us notice that the above approach generalizes measurements of polynomials of elements of @xmath0 in the sense that it shows explicitly how to measure the polynomials of elements of @xmath22 .",
    "of course , this is only of rather conceptual importance since both issues are mathematically equivalent and have the origin in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let @xmath56 be an arbitrary observable ( it may be even infinite dimensional ) which spectrum lies between finite numbers @xmath57 and @xmath58 and @xmath59 be a state acting on @xmath60 . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been pointed out that the mean value @xmath61 may be estimated in process involving the measurement of only one qubit .",
    "this fact is in good agreement with further proof that single qubits may serve as interfaces connecting quantum devices @xcite .",
    "below we recall the mathematical details of the measurement proposed in ref . @xcite . at the beginning one",
    "defines the following numbers @xmath62 and observe that the hermitian operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 satisfy @xmath65 @xcite and as such define a generalized quantum measurement which can easily be extended to a unitary evolution ( see appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed description ) . consider a partial isometry on the hilbert space @xmath66 defined by the formula @xmath67 the first hilbert space @xmath68 represents the qubit which shall be measured in order to estimate the mean value @xmath69 .",
    "the partial isometry can always be extended to unitary @xmath70 such that if it acts on @xmath71 then the final measurement of observable @xmath72 @xcite on the first ( qubit ) system gives probabilities `` spin - up '' ( of finding it in the state @xmath73 ) and `` spin - down '' ( of finding in state @xmath74 ) , respectively of the form @xmath75 one of the possible extensions of @xmath76 to the unitary on @xmath77 is the following @xmath78 the unitarity of @xmath70 follows from the fact that operators @xmath79 and @xmath80 commute .",
    "due to the practical reasons instead of unitary operation representing povm @xmath81 we shall consider @xmath82 where @xmath83 is an identity operator on the one - qubit hilbert space @xmath68 and @xmath84 is an arbitrary unitary operation that acts on @xmath85 and simplifies the decomposition of @xmath70 into elementary gates .",
    "now if we define a mean value of measurement of @xmath72 on the first qubit after action of the network ( which sometimes may be called visibility ) : @xmath86 , \\label{vis}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is a projector onto state @xmath88 , i.e. , @xmath89 , then we have an easy formula for the mean value of the initial observable @xmath56 : @xmath90    a general scheme of a network estimating the mean value ( [ meana ] ) is provided in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    , with a bounded spectrum , in a given state @xmath59 .",
    "both @xmath91 and its conjugate @xmath92 standing before @xmath70 can obviously be removed as they give rise to identity , last unitary on the bottom wire can be removed as it does not impact measurement statistics on the top qubit .",
    "however , they have been put to simplify subsequent network structure.,width=302 ]    we put an additional unitary operation on the bottom wire after unitary @xmath70 ( which does not change the statistics of the measurement on control qubit ) and divided identity operator into two unitaries acting on that wire which explicitly shows how simplification introduced in eq .",
    "( [ udet ] ) works in practice .",
    "now one may ask if the mean value @xmath93 belongs to some fixed interval , i.e. , @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are real numbers belonging to the spectrum of @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath97 $ ] ( e.g. if @xmath56 is an entanglement witness and we want to check the entanglement of a state @xmath59 then we can put @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and condition ( [ int ] ) reduces to @xmath100 ) .",
    "then one easily infers that the condition ( [ int ] ) rewritten for visibility is @xmath101 having the general network estimating @xmath102 , one needs to decompose an isometry @xmath70 onto elementary gates .",
    "one of possible ways to achieve this goal is , as we shall see below , to diagonalize the operator @xmath79 .",
    "hence we may choose @xmath84 ( see eq .",
    "( [ udet ] ) ) to be @xmath103 with @xmath104 being normalized eigenvectors of @xmath79 indexed by a binary number with length @xmath105 . since @xmath79 and @xmath80 commutes , this operation diagonalizes @xmath80 as well . by virtue of these facts ,",
    "( [ udet ] ) reduces to @xmath106 with unitaries ( as previously indexed by a binary number ) @xmath107 where @xmath108 are eigenvalues of @xmath79 .",
    "so in fact we have a combination of operations on the first qubit controlled by @xmath105 wires .",

    "in fact for any bipartite state @xmath116 we only need to substitute @xmath30 with @xmath117 with @xmath118 being some positive map",
    ". then application of the above scheme immediately reproduces all the results of the schemes from ref .",
    "@xcite but without additional noise added ( presence of which required more precision in measurement of visibility ) .    as an illustrative example",
    "consider @xmath119 , i.e. , @xmath30 is partial transposition on the second subsystem ( usually denoted by @xmath120 or by @xmath121 ) , in @xmath122 systems . due to to the fact that partial transposition is trace  preserving we need only three numbers @xmath123 , ( @xmath124 ) measurable _ via _ observables @xmath125 and @xmath126 where subscripts mean that we exchange first and second subsystems respectively .",
    "the hermitian conjugation in the above may be replaced by transposition since the permutation operators have real entries . for simplicity",

    "the above approach may be generalized to the so - called _ linear contractions criteria_. to see this let us recall that the powerful criterion called computable cross norm ( ccn ) or matrix realignment criterion has recently been introduced @xcite .",
