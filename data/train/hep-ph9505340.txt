    "the neutral kaon system has long served as a penetrating probe of fundamental physics . it has revealed or illuminated many new areas of fundamental physics , including parity violation , cp violation , flavour - changing neutral interactions , and charm .",
    "it remains the most sensitive test of fundamental symmetries , being the only place where cp violation has been observed , namely at the level of @xmath8 gev in the imaginary part of the effective mass matrix for neutral kaons , and providing the most stringent microscopic check of cpt symmetry within the framework of quantum mechanics , namely @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that cpt symmetry is a fundamental theorem of quantum field theory , which follows from locality , unitarity , and lorentz invariance @xcite .",
    "however , the topic of cpt violation has recently attracted increased attention , drawn in part by the prospect of higher - precision tests by cplear  @xcite and at da@xmath10ne  @xcite , and in part by the renewed theoretical interest in quantum gravity motivated by recent developments in string theory .",
    "some of the phenomenological discussion has been in the context of quantum mechanics @xcite , abandoning implicitly or explicitly the derivation of quantum mechanics from quantum field theory , in which cpt is sacrosanct .",
    "instead , we have followed the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a parametrization of cpt - violating effects is introduced via a deviation from conventional quantum mechanics @xcite believed to reflect the loss of quantum coherence expected in some approaches to quantum gravity @xcite , notably one based on a non - critical formulation of string theory @xcite .",
    "the suggestion that quantum coherence might be lost at the microscopic level was made in ref .",
    "@xcite , which suggested that asymptotic scattering should be described in terms of a superscattering operator @xmath11 , relating initial @xmath12 and final @xmath13 density matrices , that does not factorize as a product of @xmath14- and @xmath15-matrix elements : @xmath16 the loss of quantum coherence was thought to be a consequence of microscopic quantum - gravitational fluctuations in the space - time background .",
    "model calculations supporting this suggestion were presented  @xcite and contested  @xcite .",
    "@xcite pointed out that if eq .",
    "( [ 1.1 ] ) is correct for asymptotic scattering , there should be a corresponding effect in the quantum liouville equation that describes the time - evolution of the dentity matrix @xmath17 : @xmath18+i{\\delta\\h}\\rho\\ , \\label{1.2}\\ ] ] which is characteristic of an open quantum - mechanical system .",
    "@xcite parametrized the non - hamiltonian term in the case of a simple two - state system such as the @xmath19 system , presented a first analysis of its phenomenological consequences , and gave experimental bounds on the non - quantum - mechanical parameters .",
    "the question of microscopic quantum coherence has recently been addressed in the context of string theory using a variety of approaches @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we have analyzed this question using non - critical string theory @xcite , with criticality restored by non - trivial dynamics for a time - like liouville field @xcite , which we identify with the world - sheet cutoff and the target time variable @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to an equation of the form ( [ 1.2 ] ) , in which probability and energy are conserved , and the possible magnitude of the extra term @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a typical energy scale of the system under discussion .",
    "the details of this approach are not essential for the phenomenological discussion of this paper , but it is interesting to note that the experimental sensitivity may approach this theoretical magnitude .    it has been pointed out @xcite that at least the strong version of the cpt theorem must be violated in any theory described by a non - factorizing superscattering matrix @xmath11 ( [ 1.1 ] ) , which leads to a loss of quantum coherence .",
    "this is also true of the parametrization proposed by ref .",

    "more detailed descriptions of phenomenological implications and improved experimental bounds were presented in ref .",
    "these results were based on an analysis of @xmath22 and @xmath23 decays , and did not consider the additional constraints obtainable from an analysis of intermediate - time data . a systematic approach to the time evolution of the density matrix for the neutral kaon system was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and preliminary estimates of the improved experimental constraints on the non - quantum - mechanical parameters were presented .",

    "we show in section  [ sec : regeneration ] that experiments with a regenerator can provide useful new measurements of the non - quantum - mechanical cpt - violating parameters .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : bounds ] we derive illustrative bounds on the non - quantum - mechanical parameters from all presently available data .",
    "section  [ sec : hp ] contains a brief discussion of the extension of the formalism of ref .",
    "@xcite to the correlation measurements possible at @xmath24 factories such as da@xmath10ne .",
    "we emphasize the need to consider a general parametrization of the two - particle density matrix , that can not be expressed simply in terms of the previously - introduced single - particle density matrix parameters , and enables energy conservation to be maintained , as we have demonstrated @xcite in our non - critical string theory approach to the loss of quantum coherence . in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we review our conclusions and discuss the prospects for future experimental and theoretical work .",

    "in this section we first review aspects of the modifications ( [ 1.2 ] ) of quantum mechanics believed to be induced by quantum gravity @xcite , as argued specifically in the context of a non - critical string analysis @xcite .",
    "this provides a specific form for the modification ( [ 1.2 ] ) of the quantum liouville equation for the temporal evolution of the density matrix of observable matter @xcite @xmath27 + i{\\delta\\h } \\rho \\qquad ; \\qquad \\delta\\h \\equiv { \\dot g}^i g_{ij } [ g^i , \\rho ] \\label{one}\\ ] ] where the coordinates @xmath28 parametrize the space of possible string models and the extra term @xmath29 is such that the time evolution has the following basic properties :    \\(i ) the total probability is _ conserved _ in time @xmath30",
    "\\(ii ) the energy @xmath21 is _ conserved on the average _ @xmath31 as a result of the _ renormalizability _ of the world - sheet @xmath32-model specified by the parameters @xmath33 which describe string propagation in a string space - time foam background .",

    "@xmath35 which vanishes only if one restricts one s attention to critical ( conformal ) strings , in which case there is no arrow of time @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that quantum fluctuations in the background space time should be treated by including non - critical ( liouville ) strings @xcite , in which case ( [ 2.3 ] ) becomes a strict inequality .",
    "this latter property also implies that the statistical entropy @xmath36 is also monotonically increasing with time , pure states evolve into mixed ones and there is an arrow of time in this picture @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) correspondingly , the superscattering matrix @xmath11 , which is defined by its action on asymptotic density matrices @xmath37 can not be factorised into the usual product of the heisenberg scattering matrix and its hermitian conjugate @xmath38 with @xmath39 the hamiltonian operator of the system . in particular",
    "this property implies that @xmath11 has no inverse , which is also expected from the property ( iii ) .",
    "\\(v ) the absence of an inverse for @xmath11 implies that _ strong _ cpt invariance of the low - energy subsystem is lost , according to the general analysis of @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that , although for the purposes of the present work we keep the microscopic origin of the quantum - mechanics - violating terms unspecified , it is only in the non - critical string model of ref .",
    "@xcite - and the associated approach to the nature of time - that a concrete microscopic model guaranteeing the properties ( i)-(v ) has so far emerged naturally . within this framework , we expect that the string @xmath32-model coordinates @xmath33 obey renormalization - group equations of the general form @xmath40 where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to the target time , measured in string @xmath41 units , and @xmath21 is a typical energy scale in the observable matter system . since @xmath42 and @xmath33 are themselves dimensionless numbers of order unity , we expect that @xmath43 in general .",
    "however , it should be emphasized that there are expected to be system - dependent numerical factors that depend on the underlying string model , and that @xmath44 might be suppressed by further ( @xmath45)-dependent factors , or even vanish .",

    "@xcite , the extra ( non - hamiltonian ) term in the liouville equation for @xmath47 can be parametrized by a @xmath48 matrix @xmath49 , where the indices @xmath50 enumerate the hermitian @xmath32-matrices @xmath51 , which we represent in the @xmath52 basis .",

    "@xcite , we assume that the dominant violations of quantum mechanics conserve strangeness , so that @xmath55 = 0 , and that @xmath56 = 0 so as to conserve probability . since @xmath57 is a symmetric matrix , it follows that also @xmath58 .",
    "thus , we arrive at the general parametrization @xmath59 where , as a result of the positivity of the hermitian density matrix @xmath47 @xcite @xmath60    we recall @xcite that the cpt transformation can be expressed as a linear combination of @xmath61 in the @xmath52 basis : @xmath62 , for some choice of phase @xmath63 .",
    "it is apparent that none of the non - zero terms @xmath64 in @xmath65 ( [ nine ] ) commutes with the cpt transformation . in other words ,",
    "each of the three parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 violates cpt , leading to a richer phenomenology than in conventional quantum mechanics .",
    "this is because the symmetric @xmath29 matrix has three parameters in its bottom right - hand @xmath69 submatrix , whereas the @xmath70 matrix appearing in the time evolution within quantum mechanics @xcite has only one complex cpt - violating parameter @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 violate cpt , but do not induce any mixing in the time evolution of pure state vectors@xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the usual differences between mass and decay widths , respectively , of @xmath22 and @xmath23 states . a brief review of the quantum - mechanical formalism is given in appendix  [ app : a ] .",

    "the above results imply that the experimental constraints @xcite on cpt violation have to be rethought .",
