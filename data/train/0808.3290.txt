    "rapidly oscillating fields cause interesting phenomena in a wide variety of systems .",
    "those phenomena are often discussed in the view of stabilization of an unstable state .",
    "one of the simplest examples is the problem of kapitza s inverted pendulum , which was generalized by landau and lifshitz  @xcite .",
    "the key idea is to separate the dynamics into a rapidly oscillating part and a slowly varying part .",
    "the method has been applied to various systems , e.g. , the classical and quantum dynamics in periodically driven systems  @xcite , the stabilization of a matter - wave soliton in two - dimensional bose - einstein condensates without an external trap  @xcite , and magnetic domain patterns traveling at a slow velocity under a rapidly oscillating field  @xcite .",
    "domain patterns are observed in a wide variety of systems , and they show many kinds of structures ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "magnetic domain patterns are one of their good examples .",
    "while they usually exhibit a labyrinth structure under zero field , they also show other kinds of structures under an oscillating field .",
    "for instance , parallel - stripe and several kinds of lattice structures are observed in experiments and numerical simulations  @xcite .",
    "moreover , traveling patterns  @xcite and more interesting patterns , e.g. , spirals and concentric - ring patterns  @xcite , have been observed , depending on the strength and frequency of the field .",
    "spirals and concentric - ring patterns appear under a large - amplitude and high - frequency field in experiments , and the field range where they appear is not wide .    in this paper , we investigate effects of an oscillating field by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis , focusing on the emergence of concentric - ring magnetic domain patterns surrounding a strong defect .",
    "recently , two theoretical methods were proposed to investigate the effects of an oscillating field on pattern formation in ferromagnetic thin films  @xcite .",
    "one gives the `` time - averaged model '' and the other gives the `` phase - shifted model '' : the former is derived by averaging out rapidly oscillating terms , and the latter includes the delay of the response to the oscillating field . in this paper ,",
    "the time - averaged model is applied to theoretical analysis , since it is suitable for discussing `` stationary '' domain patterns which oscillate periodically but are unchanged in terms of a long - time average .",
    "the theoretical line of the threshold for nonuniform patterns is derived from the time - averaged model .",
    "the theoretical threshold is consistent with the numerically simulated one in a high - frequency region , where a concentric - ring pattern appears around the defect .",
    "in fact , there are several techniques to study domain patterns under a rapidly oscillating field theoretically . applying a multi - time - scale technique  @xcite",
    ", one can obtain more complex equations in a better approximation than the time - averaged model .",
    "in other words , the time - averaged model corresponds to the lowest orders of multi - time - scale expansions . in this paper ,",
    "the time - averaged model is employed since it has a simple form and is efficient enough to discuss the appearance of concentric - ring patterns in a high - frequency region .",
    "the creation of a concentric - ring pattern can have different mechanisms .",
    "one of them is boundary conditions , and the strong defect is a kind of boundary condition .",
    "the selection of a pattern depends on boundary conditions as well as the field frequency or other parameters  @xcite .",
    "for example , in nematic liquid crystals under a rotating magnetic field , it is sometimes observed that the center of concentric rings nucleated by a dust particle moves away from it  @xcite ; faraday experiments of viscous fluid and granular layers in round cells show concentric - ring patterns or spiral patterns  @xcite in some cases . on the other hand , concentric - ring patterns can also appear spontaneously .",
    "in fact , spiral patterns as well as concentric - ring patterns appear in the absence of a strong defect under some conditions  @xcite .",
    "however , we will not consider spontaneously created concentric - ring patterns in this paper since those patterns are beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "[ fig : diagram](a ) and [ fig : diagram](b ) , respectively .",

    "actually , the time - averaged model  ( [ eq : t_av ] ) without a strong defect can also produce concentric - ring patterns . if the initial condition is given as @xmath84 at the center and @xmath85 anywhere else , then concentric - ring patterns , as shown in fig .",

    "( [ eq : eta ] ) is very small , which means that the time scale of pattern formation is very slow .",
    "in fact , it takes more than 10 times longer time to obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : snap](a ) than fig .",
    "[ fig : snap](b ) .",
    "if the initial pattern were completely uniform , nonuniform patterns could not appear easily .",
    "in other words , the initial condition employed here causes concentric rings on a uniform initial pattern ( except for the center ) as one of the simplest patterns .",
    "this situation is very similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](a ) : the strong defect in the original model behaves as a kind of boundary condition in the almost uniform pattern near the threshold . since the growth rate of the instability is very slow near the threshold , no patterns except for concentric rings can grow for figs .",
    "[ fig : snap](a ) or [ fig : diagram](a ) .",
    "the growth rate is expected to be relevant to the correlation length , which is related to the number of concentric rings . from analogy with critical phenomena",
    ", one can estimate that the correlation length would be proportional to @xmath88 , where @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the correlation length diverges near the threshold , as @xmath90 .",
    "this is the mechanism of the emergence of a concentric - ring pattern around a strong defect and also the reason why the boundaries of the concentric - ring - pattern region are unclear in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] .",
    "in contrast , fig .",
    "[ fig : snap](b ) has a few concentric rings , although stripes ( or mazes ) spread outside the rings .",
    "the stripes grow independently from the concentric rings because of rather large @xmath66 s .",
    "the difference between figs .",
    "[ fig : snap](b ) and [ fig : diagram](b ) comes out not only because the time - averaged model is invalid far from the threshold , but also because the initial condition employed here is pretty different from the situation for fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram](b ) .    the time - averaged model is also invalid for low frequencies .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] in which the theoretical threshold line is not consistent with the numerical one for @xmath91 .",
    "the failure of the time - averaged model in a low - frequency region comes from the assumption @xmath92 .",
    "the assumption is valid when the time scales of the rapidly oscillating part and the slowly varying part are well separated . for low frequencies ,",
    "their separation is not sufficient .",
    "if a multi - time - scale technique were applied , a better theoretical threshold line would be obtained .",
    "the concentric - ring patterns shown in this paper are purely numerical results , although they suggest a possible mechanism about the formation of the patterns .",
    "since the characteristics of domain patterns strongly depends on experimental conditions and samples , it is rather hard to compare experimental data with the results obtained in this paper .",
    "however , we can suggest that concentric - ring patterns appear in a certain range of the field strength and frequency , which is located above a labyrinth - pattern region .",
    "in fact , also in experiments , spirals and concentric rings are often observed near the threshold of nonuniform patterns  @xcite , although they are not always centered at a strong defect but often move around . incidentally , for typical ferromagnetic garnet films , the order of the characteristic domain width is about 10 - 100 @xmath93 and that of the frequency for lattices , spirals , or concentric rings is about 0.1 - 100 kh  @xcite .",
    "in this paper , effects of an oscillating field have been investigated , and the emergence of concentric - ring patterns surrounding a strong defect has been discussed .",
    "the numerical simulations show that the concentric - ring pattern appears in the high - frequency region near the threshold for nonuniform patterns .",
    "the simulated profiles of the concentric - ring pattern indicate that the pattern consists of two parts ( except for the vicinity of the defect ) : a rapidly oscillating spatially homogeneous part and a nonuniform pattern part .",
    "this fact assures that the time - averaged model is suitable for the theoretical analysis .",
    "the theoretical threshold line is in good agreement with the numerical one in a high - frequency region .",
    "when the rapidly oscillating field makes the state close to the threshold , the concentric - ring pattern appears due to the strong defect which is an effective boundary condition .    in conclusion ,",
    "the validity of the time - averaged model has been demonstrated in the presence of a rapidly oscillating filed .",
    "it gives the good estimate of the threshold for nonuniform patterns when the field frequency is high .",
    "moreover , it is revealed that ideal and interesting patterns such as concentric - ring patterns can appear near the threshold , depending on boundary conditions .",
