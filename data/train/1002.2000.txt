    "the advances in processing and manipulating molecules at solid substrates on the nanometer scale opens up new vistas for technological applications of hybrid organic - inorganic interfaces .",
    "this includes , e.g. , the fabrication of nanostructured transistors being sensitive to specific biomolecules  @xcite and the application of organic electronic devices on polymer basis such as organic light - emitting diodes  @xcite and molecular storage cells  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the investigation of molecular self - assembly  @xcite near substrates has recently been subject of numerous experimental and computational studies , e.g. , for peptide adhesion to metals and semiconductors  @xcite .",
    "the understanding of the cooperative effects of structure formation at substrates requires systematic studies of mesoscopic aspects of adsorption transitions .",
    "this regards scaling properties near the adsorption / desorption transition in the thermodynamic limit of large polymer systems at planar surfaces  @xcite , also under pulling force  @xcite .",
    "adhesion studies of polymers were also performed at curved surfaces such as nanotubes  @xcite and nanoparticles  @xcite .",
    "particular attention has been dedicated to the complete phase structure of adsorbed macromolecules which has been investigated by means of simple lattice models for polymers  @xcite and peptides  @xcite , as well as by employing an off - lattice polymer model  @xcite .",
    "hybrid systems on the nanoscopic scale must basically be considered as being `` small '' .",
    "thus , the study of finite - size effects in the formation of polymer assemblies in a thermal environment is relevant . here , we are going to discuss thermodynamic properties of the adsorption transition of a flexible , interacting polymer at an attractive substrate .",
    "the polymer is not anchored at the surface and can therefore freely move as long as it does not get into contact with the substrate .",
    "the statistical analysis is performed in the microcanonical ensemble in order to retain characteristic , non - negligible surface effects .",
    "this approach has already proven quite useful for a deeper understanding of first - order - like structural transitions such as molecular aggregation processes  @xcite and protein folding  @xcite .",
    "a particularly striking result was the recent identification of intrinsic hierarchies of subphase transitions that accompany the overall cooperative process of assembly  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of microcanonical thermodynamics  @xcite in small - system transitions has also been stated in simulational and experimental atomic clustering studies  @xcite , fragmenting nuclei  @xcite , and for scaling analyses in magnetic systems employing discrete or continuous spin models  @xcite .",
    "a more exotic example is the seminal application of this approach to astrophysical systems  @xcite , which manifests its broad universality .",
    "the central quantity in the microcanonical formalism is the number ( or density ) of states @xmath0 with system energy @xmath1 , or the microcanonical entropy defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "in contrast to canonical ( @xmath4 ) statistics , where the temperature @xmath5 is an externally fixed control parameter , in the microcanoncial ( @xmath6 ) ensemble it is _ derived _ from the entropy , @xmath7_{n , v}^{-1}$ ] . in both ensembles ,",
    "the particle number @xmath8 and the volume @xmath9 are kept fixed .",
    "particularly interesting microcanonical effects occur in the transition regime , if the entropy is a convex function of energy in this region .",
    "the physical consequence is that with _ increasing _ system energy the temperature _",
    "decreases_. this can only be explained by the fact that conformational transitions of small systems are governed by their surfaces , whereas volume effects become only relevant for large systems [ even a perfectly tetrahedral atomic cluster with 309 atoms contains still more atoms in the outer shell ( 162 ) than in the interior ( 147 ) ] .",
    "a remarkable side effect is the negativity of the microcanonical specific heat , @xmath10_{n , v}=[\\partial t(e)/\\partial e]_{n , v}^{-1}= -[\\partial s(e)/\\partial e]_{n , v}^2/[\\partial^2 s(e)/\\partial e^2]_{n , v}$ ] , in the regions of negative curvature of @xmath11 .",
    "thus , as long as the surface - to - volume ratio is large enough to suppress a concave increase of the microcanonical entropy and the energetic separation of the two distinct phases [ one of which is entropy - dominated ( e.g. , liquid ) and the other energy - dominated ( e.g. , solid ) ] is sufficiently large to establish a kinetic barrier , microcanonical effects matter .",
    "this regards all first - order phase transitions and two - state systems ( e.g. , proteins with two - state folding characteristics ) .",
    "it also matters for transitions , where phase co - existence is completely absent in the thermodynamic limit , but not for the finite systems .",
    "the latter case is what we would like to consider in more detail in the following : the adsorption transition of flexible polymers to an attractive substrate , known to be a second - order phase transition in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , as we will show here , the adsorption of nongrafted polymers with finite lengths exhibits signals of a first - order transition which we find to vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "the polymer is represented by a bead - stick model with standard lennard - jones ( lj ) interaction between nonbonded monomers , mimicking short - range volume exclusion and long - range van der waals ( vdw ) attraction .",
    "bond lengths between adjacent monomers are normalized to unity . since the original model ( called the `` ab model ''  @xcite ) was designed for mesoscopic heteropolymers , an additional weak bending energy was introduced which is kept here .",

    "the energetic separation of these phases is defined by the intersection of the caloric temperature curve and the maxwell line in the region , where temperature decreases with increasing energy . this typical microcanonical effect in a finite system is due to dominant effects at the polymer coil surface .",
