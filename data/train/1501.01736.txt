    "also @xmath525 belongs to the orbit of @xmath523 , because @xmath528 .",
    "therefore , it is enough to consider the @xmath526-action on @xmath523 .",
    "let us find the stabilizer of @xmath523 under the @xmath526-action .",
    "it is easy to find the following subgroup of @xmath529 @xmath530 which is isomorphic to the dihedral group @xmath531 .",
    "it is less obvious to notice this other subgroup of the stabilizer @xmath532 which is isomorphic to the klein group @xmath533 . to see why @xmath534 , just take any @xmath535 and observe that @xmath536 and @xmath523 have the same intersection number with every boundary @xmath4-stratum on @xmath5 .    to show that @xmath529 is actually generated by @xmath537 and @xmath538 ,",
    "take any @xmath539 .",
    "thinking of @xmath540 as a bijection @xmath541\\rightarrow[7]$ ] , then @xmath542 .",
    "this is true because , in order to preserve the intersection numbers with the boundary @xmath4-strata , we need to send a labeled point that lies on a line containing exactly two labeled points to a labeled point having the same property . in particular",
    ", we must have that @xmath543 .",
    "therefore @xmath540 acts by permuting the two sets @xmath544 and @xmath545 separately .",
    "now there are two cases : @xmath540 fixes @xmath4 or not .",
    "in the first case , the only possibility for @xmath540 is to be an element of @xmath537 .",
    "if @xmath540 does not fix @xmath4 , then assume that @xmath540 is the identity on @xmath544 ( we can assume this up to composing with an element of @xmath537 ) . in this case , one can check that @xmath540 must be an element of @xmath538 in order to preserve the intersection numbers with the boundary @xmath4-strata on @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , we just deduced that @xmath546 .",
    "an easy count tells us that @xmath547 , and therefore the orbit of @xmath523 has @xmath548 distinct equivalence classes .",
    "as one can easily check , these classes generate distinct rays in @xmath25 .",
    "the next proposition summarizes what we proved so far .",
    "[ classificationspecialhypertreesurfaceschardifferentfrom2 ] in characteristic different from @xmath4 , there are @xmath31 distinct equivalence classes of special hypertree surfaces on @xmath5 .",
    "these classes generate @xmath31 distinct rays of @xmath20 which lie outside of the cone @xmath27 .",
    "the discussion in characteristic @xmath4 is essentially the same , but with the following exceptions .",
    "first of all , in figure  [ figure3 ] , the seven lines intersect in seven points ( one of which is unlabeled ) , giving the well known fano configuration .",
    "also in this case , @xmath512 has to be the unlabeled point at the intersection of three lines , and therefore we produced only one special hypertree surface .",
    "now , if we consider the @xmath526-action , it is straightforward to see that the stabilizer of the special hypertree surface we found is @xmath549 , which has @xmath550 elements .",
    "so , the analogue of proposition  [ classificationspecialhypertreesurfaceschardifferentfrom2 ] in characteristic @xmath4 is the following .",
    "in characteristic @xmath4 , there are @xmath32 distinct equivalence classes of special hypertree surfaces on @xmath5 .",
    "these classes generate @xmath32 distinct rays of @xmath20 which lie outside of the cone @xmath27 .",
    "we do not know yet if the rays generated by the equivalence classes of the special hypertree surfaces are extremal in @xmath25 , and certainly a proof or a disproof of the extremality of these rays would be a further step toward the understanding of the cone @xmath25 .",
    "we observed that the equivalence classes of the special hypertree surfaces are invariant with respect to a certain subgroup of @xmath526 .",
    "given a subgroup @xmath551 of @xmath552 , the idea of considering @xmath551-invariant sub - loci of @xmath1 intersecting the interior @xmath553 recently appeared in @xcite .",
    "also , the same idea was previously used to describe the keel - vermeire divisors ( see ( * ? ? ? * section 3 ) ) .    consider the moduli space @xmath554 , which is the quotient of @xmath1 by the natural action @xmath555 . as we studied @xmath25",
    ", one can also consider @xmath556 .",
    "for a study of the pseudoeffective cone @xmath557 see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 7.3 ) .",
    "let us define the following subcone of @xmath25 .",
    "define @xmath558 to be the cone generated by the equivalence classes of the boundary @xmath4-strata , the lifts of the keel - vermeire divisors on @xmath19 and the embedded blow ups of @xmath28 in @xmath5 .",
    "it follows from what we proved that we have strict inclusions:@xmath559",
    "we can generalize our constructions for @xmath4-cycles on @xmath5 to any @xmath1 with @xmath37 .",
    "first , define @xmath560 inductively to be the subcone of @xmath561 generated by @xmath562 and by the lifts of the effective @xmath4-cycles in @xmath563 .",
    "similarly , we can define @xmath564 inductively to be the subcone of @xmath561 generated by @xmath562 , by the lifts of the effective @xmath4-cycles in @xmath565 and by the embedded blow up of @xmath28 in @xmath1 . since we already know that @xmath566 , it is not hard to see that we have the following strict inclusions @xmath567            9 d. chen and i. coskun : _ extremal higher codimension cycles on moduli spaces of curves _ , proc .",
