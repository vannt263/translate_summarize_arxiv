    "it is now well established that super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) reside in the nuclei of many galaxies .",
    "the masses of these smbhs correlate with a range of properties of their host spheroids , including luminosity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consequently mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the concentration of stellar bulge light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; the deficit of stellar bulge light in ellipticals ; and the gravitational binding energy of the bulge .    the correlation between smbh mass ( @xmath2 ) and the velocity dispersion ( @xmath1 ) of its host spheroid , referred to below as a `` @xmath3@xmath1 relation '' , has been studied by many authors .",

    "* ) , and is now widely interpreted as the imprint of the self - regulated growth of the smbh .",
    "a more recent extended sample of galaxies shows that the power law index @xmath5 may be as high as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent work has highlighted that the @xmath2@xmath1 relation one measures will depend on the nature of the galaxy sample .",
    "for example , @xcite presents two extremely massive smbh , @xmath8 , in the centres of two giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "combined with other previous smbh mass measurements , these authors obtain @xmath9 for elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "a similar but offset to lower smbh masses result is found for spiral galaxies in the sample .",
    "alternatively , when data for all galaxies are combined in one @xmath2@xmath1 relation , @xmath10 is found .",
    "another important conclusion is gradually emerging from the observations : smbhs in galaxies that show flattened morphology , such as discs , pseudobulges or bars appear to be less massive at same @xmath1 than their counterparts in elliptical galaxies .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that pseudobulge galaxies tend to have undermassive smbhs , and @xcite showed that barred galaxies tend to have smbhs that are a factor of @xmath11 to ten smaller than elliptical galaxies at the same velocity dispersion . while @xcite , in variance with other authors , find that smbhs in pseudobulges and galaxy discs do _ not _ even follow an @xmath12@xmath1 relation , their results are consistent with that of the other authors in that most of their pseudobulge systems lie below the @xmath2@xmath1 for ellipticals .",
    "@xcite firmed up these conclusions with a sample of narrow line seyfert 1 nuclei ( all classifiable as pseudobulge systems ) .",
    "a useful compilation of the recent data , summarising these points , is given in the right panel of fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our paper is to show that there is a unified theoretical picture within which this observational trend can be understood , and that the observed @xmath2@xmath1 relations place very interesting constraints on the still unknown feeding mode of smbhs .",
    "a well known difficulty in fuelling active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is that the typical angular momentum of gas in the galactic bulge is very large compared with that of the last stable orbit around a black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one expects that due to circularisation shocks , gas will end up in a planar feature , such as a disc or a ring ( cf .",

    "it has been argued that large scale angular momentum transfer occurs rapidly enough through the action of stellar and gaseous bars ( e.e .",
    "* ) or via spiral density waves @xcite to overcome this difficulty .",
    "these galaxy - wide gas discs ( with radial scales of many kpc ) could then extend all the way to the inner galaxy and even feed the smbh .",
    "this `` planar mode '' of feeding is schematically illustrated in the left panel of figure 1 .    however , gas discs tend to become unstable to gravitational fragmentation and resulting star formation ( sf ) beyond a self - gravity radius of @xmath13 pc ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the simplest model this would result in complete consumption of gas in the disc by star formation @xcite and so there would be no way to fuel the smbh . however , stellar feedback could heat up the large scale disc to self - regulate the star formation rate in the disc to a level such that a sufficient amount of gas can reach the smbh , but there is no clear consensus on this point ( e.g. , * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative solution to the difficulty of fuelling agn is provided by chaotic feeding @xcite or ballistic accretion of cold streams when the gas is cold enough to form dense clouds or filaments @xcite .",
    "large scale cosmological simulations show that cold streams may be important for supplying relatively low angular momentum gas to galaxies(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while higher resolution simulations that resolve the regions nearer to smbh suggest that similar processes may operate on smaller scales @xcite . in particular , the numerical experiments of @xcite show that turbulence ( driven by stellar feedback in the bulge ) in a quasi - spherical distribution of gas leads to formation of convergent flows that create high density filaments .",
    "the latter can travel almost ballistically through the rest of the bulge , with some filaments arriving in the inner parsecs of the galaxy .",
    "note that most of the gas still ends up in a galaxy - scale disc with a large angular momentum ; however , the smbh receives most of its fuel not from that disc but from the gas filaments arriving at its vicinity directly .",
    "this `` chaotic cold streams '' feeding mode is schematically shown in the right panel of figure 1 . in this class of model the orientation of the innermost sub - pc scale disc",
    "makes a random walk because of the arrival of material with a fluctuating angular momentum .",
    "the cancellation of the angular momentum in shocks transfers gas into the smbh more rapidly than viscous torques can , and so these discs should be more resilient to star formation . furthermore , because the orientation of the inner disc is constantly changing , feedback from the agn will be quasi - isotropic .",
    "+ the main point of our paper can be summarised as follows .",
    "large scale gas discs are better able to withstand agn feedback than quasi - spherical inflows @xcite .",
    "this is so even under the most optimistic assumptions about agn feedback  that is , feedback acting directly on the disc without being shadowed by the inner disc , and no beaming away from the disc / galaxy plane .",
    "we show that , under these most favourable of conditions for which agn feedback is maximal , there is a critical smbh mass at which its feedback expels the disc that feeds it .",
    "we call this a `` disc @xmath14@xmath1 relation '' because it arises only for smbhs accreting from large scale galaxy discs . this mass is larger than the canonical @xmath14@xmath1 relation , and any dilution of agn feedback would increase it even further .",
    "theoretically we see that if smbhs were fed by planar accretion then we could expect smbhs in pseudobulge systems to lie above the @xmath14@xmath1 relation for classical bulges .",
    "observationally there is no strong evidence for this ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so we conclude that most smbhs do not grow via the planar accretion mode but are much more likely to be fed by quasi - spherical inflows as in the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "to avoid misunderstanding , we note that galaxy - scale gas discs and gas bars are obviously important for galaxy evolution as a whole , e.g. , as a birthplace for a significant fraction of all stars , and also by effecting a radial redistribution of gas and stars within the galaxy , but we see no clear observational evidence that these features are able to channel their gas all the way to the smbhs .",
    "we briefly review existing ideas of agn feedback acting on quasi - spherical distributions of gas before moving on to the problem of agn feedback acting on a gas disc . @xcite assumed feedback in the form of an energy - conserving outflow and obtained a scaling @xmath15 .",
    "subsequently , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite solved the momentum equations for momentum - conserving agn feedback acting on a spherical shell of gas in an isothermal bulge potential ( see below ) and showed that it leads to a @xmath2@xmath1 relation @xmath16 where we follow king s analysis ; here @xmath17 is the opacity , which is assumed to be dominated by the electron scattering , and @xmath18 is the baryon fraction , which is assumed to be equal to the initial cosmological value of @xmath19 ( cf . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we note that all of the aforementioned theoretical approaches used a singular isothermal sphere potential ( e.g. ,  4.3.3b in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for simplicity .",
    "for such a potential , the one dimensional velocity dispersion is a constant independent of radius , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the total enclosed mass including dark matter inside radius @xmath22 ( the distance from the centre of the galaxy ) .",
    "the enclosed gas mass , @xmath23 is proportional to @xmath22 . the gas density at radius @xmath22 for such a potential is @xmath24 for reference .",
    "@xcite assumed that the smbh luminosity is limited by the eddington value @xmath25 , and the momentum outflow rate produced by radiation pressure @xcite is of order @xmath26 we can recover the result of @xcite using a simpler `` weight argument '' , which requires that the momentum output produced by the smbh ( @xmath27 ) should just balance the weight of the gas in the bulge , @xmath28/ r^2 $ ] , which turns out to be independent of radius : @xmath29 to order of magnitude , equation [ w ] holds for any potential if estimated at a radius which encloses most of the gas potentially available for smbh fueling , e.g. , such as the virial radius for the @xcite potential .",
    "balancing the outward force of the outflow ( equation [ pismbh ] ) with the weight of the gas in the bulge ( equation [ w ] ) then leads naturally to equation  [ msig ] .",
    "the momentum feedback model is attractive in its physical simplicity .",
    "the model is underpinned by observations of fast @xmath30 outflows from bright agn and quasars . studying the blue shifted ionised absorption features in the 7 to 10 kev energy range in a large sample of agn with _ xmm - newton _ , @xcite concluded that such fast agn outflows appear in @xmath31 % of the sample .",
    "as these authors emphasise , their uniform sample overcomes `` publication bias '' and shows that fast agn outflows are widespread .",
    "it also requires the outflows to be wide - angled ( rather than jet - like ) , which is beneficial in spreading the influence of agn feedback as broadly over the galaxy bulge as possible .",
    "equation [ msig ] contains no free parameters , but nevertheless it is very close to the observed @xmath2@xmath1 relation .",
    "similar reasoning helps to explain both the observed @xmath2@xmath1 relation for nuclear star clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the observation that ncs are preferentially found in low mass ( low @xmath1 ) galaxies @xcite . the model has been used recently by @xcite to explain the two @xmath3210 kpc scale symmetric lobes apparently filled with cosmic rays detected by _ fermi - lat _ telescope in the milky way @xcite . to explain the particular geometry of the bubbles ,",
    "the only adjustment to the basic @xcite model required by @xcite has been an addition of a dense disc of molecular gas , known as the central molecular zone , found in the central @xmath32 200 pc of our galaxy @xcite .",
    "while it is clear that the exact @xmath33 relation derived analytically is affected by the choice of the potential , we note that the main conclusion of our paper  the fact that it is harder to expel a disc feeding the smbh rather than a quasi - spherical shell  remains unchanged as it is based on a simple geometrical argument ( see below ) . furthermore , gravitational potentials of elliptical and lenticular galaxies appear to be relatively well approximated by a constant @xmath1 value inside their effective radii .",
    "@xcite find that the 1d velocity dispersion of stars within the galaxies in their sample depends on radius @xmath22 ( within the galaxy ) as a very weak power - law : @xmath34 .",
    "this implies that @xmath1 drops on average by the factor of @xmath35 when @xmath22 changes by an order of magnitude , and @xmath36 varies by the factor of @xmath37 .    indeed ,",
    "@xcite consider smbh momentum feedback for potentials other than isothermal , e.g. , the nfw potential @xcite , @xcite and @xcite potentials . in all cases momentum",
    "driven outflow produce relations of the form @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the maximum circular velocity in the potential .",
    "the normalisation of the relation is slightly smaller than for the simpler isothermal potential we use here , which implies that escape from the isothermal potential is slightly more demanding than for all the others . to quote a numerical factor here ,",
    "@xcite find a change in the critical smbh mass ( only ) by a factor of order unity only for the nfw potential , as an example , if one defines @xmath1 at the peak of the rotation curve of the potential as @xmath40 .",
    "no analytical treatment for the complex problem at hand can be expected to be accurate within better than a factor of @xmath41 , and therefore we feel that the singular isothermal potential is an appropriate approximation to use here .",
    "as shown by @xcite , the above argument does not quite work for a non - spherical geometry . to see this ,",
    "consider the simplest example  an axially symmetric rotating galaxy .",
    "the gas settles in the plane of symmetry of the galaxy and forms a rotationally supported disc .",
    "let @xmath43 be the local ( i.e. , at a given @xmath22 ) vertical disc scale - height .",
    "let us consider a disc at radius @xmath22 .",
    "the _ maximum _",
    "momentum flux from the smbh outflow striking the disc is @xmath44 this is an absolute maximum given by the total momentum outflow rate ( equation 2 ) times the fraction of the solid angle the disc subtends as seen from the smbh location . in reality some of the momentum outflow from the agn could be intercepted ( shadowed ) by the disc at smaller radii ( cf .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 ) , and also the outflow may be beamed along the direction perpendicular to the disc .",
    "these individual effects actually strengthen the conclusion we draw because they act to lessen the effect of feedback on the disc and therefore should increase the mass of the smbh .",
    "we first assume that the disc mass is dominated by gas , and we correct for the presence of stars * within the disc * later on .",
    "the effective weight of the gas disc is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the disc mass , and @xmath47 is the gas disc surface density , with @xmath48 being the mid - plane disc density .",
    "we note here that a disc in circular rotation actually has a zero weight because gravity is exactly balanced by the centrifugal force .",
    "however , within a factor of a few the effective weight defined above still applies to infinity for a circularly rotating disc is smaller by a factor of @xmath49 than that from a static point within the same potential ] if we wish to expel the disc to infinity ( where the centrifugal force becomes negligible if the angular momentum of the material is conserved ) .",
    "therefore , by requiring that momentum flux balances weight ( @xmath50 ) we limit the smbh mass to @xmath51 a casual look at this equation would seem to suggest that , because @xmath43 and @xmath52 may vary with radius @xmath22 and from system to system , one should not expect any robust correlation between @xmath2 and @xmath36 to arise .",
    "what is missing in the above analysis is the possibility of star formation in the galaxy disc ( this was also not included in the numerical experiments of * ? ? ?",
    "massive cool gas discs become gravitationally unstable when the toomre @xmath53-parameter approaches unity from above @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the epicyclic frequency . noting that @xmath56 for the singular isothermal sphere potential , @xmath57 , and using the hydrostatic balance condition @xmath58 , we find that @xmath59 note that @xmath52 , defined just below equation [ pdisc ] , is function of @xmath22 in the above equation .",
    "it is widely believed that self - gravitating gas discs self - regulate their star formation rates to maintain marginally stable states . as a disc becomes self - gravitating",
    ", stars form on a local dynamical time scale ( i.e. , extremely rapidly ) and the energy and momentum released by the stars heat the disc up ; this increases @xmath53 and the star formation rate is reduced to an equilibrium rate that maintains quasi - equilibrium .",
    "generally , the disc * first * becomes unstable when @xmath60 , and therefore we arrive at the constraint @xmath61 using this now in equation [ mmax0 ] , we arrive at the  disc @xmath2@xmath1 relation \" , @xmath62 where we introduce @xmath63 as the gas mass fraction in the disc to account for the fact that a realistic galaxy disc contains gas and stars as well . according to this definition ,",
    "the fraction @xmath64 of the disc mass is in the recently formed stars or very dense massive molecular clumps on the way to collapsing and forming stars .",
    "we see that the disk @xmath2@xmath1 relation is of exactly same form as the  spherical \" @xmath2@xmath1 relation ( equation [ msig ] ) derived by @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the coefficient in front of the latter is smaller than that in the former .",
    "the difference is difficult to quantify exactly , but would seem to be at least a factor of a few to ten .",
    "physically , it is due to ( 1 ) the factor @xmath65 in front of the spherical relation and @xmath66 for the disk relation .",
    "it is unlikely that @xmath66 is significantly smaller than unity during the early gas - rich epoch of galaxy formation .",
    "furthermore , in principle a similar in meaning coefficient  taking into account that part of the spherical shell is already converted into stars  may be introduced in the spherical @xmath2@xmath1 relation , in which case the difference between the two relations would be exactly equal to @xmath18 .",
    "( 2 ) when deriving the disc @xmath67 relation , we took the most optimistic assumptions about the agn feedback on the disc .",
    "as discussed below equation [ pdisc ] , realistically , a part of the feedback can be shadowed by the inner disk ( the innermost part of which is very hard to affect by the feedback , see below ) .",
    "beaming away from the disc plane may decrease the momentum feedback on the disc further yet .",
    "another important point is that although our arguments were presented for a disc geometry , they are also applicable to a bar - mediated gas inflows , such as those discussed by @xcite . these authors argued that `` bars within bars '' may effectively channel the gas into the central regions of galaxies to fuel agn .",
    "however , bars present even less of an effective solid angle than discs for agn feedback to work on : barred gas inflows are squashed geometrically not only to the galaxy midplane , as disc inflows , but also in the azimuthal direction within the galaxy plane . therefore the momentum striking",
    "a bar would be even less than that for the disc ( equation [ pdisc ] ) , and thus we would expect even more massive smbhs if they were limited by their feedback on the gas bars only .",
    "the derivation in this section is applicable to regions well beyond the black hole s influence radius , @xmath68 , which is typically of the order of a few to tens of pc . in the appendix",
    "we show that a gas disc at @xmath69 is actually able to withstand the momentum feedback of the agn .",
    "this is why the sketch in figure 1 shows small scale discs unaffected by the feedback .",
    "@xcite found that smbhs do not correlate with circular velocities of galaxy discs .",
    "@xcite showed that smbhs in pseudobulge galaxies are _ underweight _ by a factor of about ten with respect to their cousins in classical bulge systems .",
    "@xcite showed that barred galaxies tend to have smbhs that are a factor of @xmath11 to ten smaller than elliptical galaxies at the same velocity dispersion .",
    "@xcite found that observed smbhs do not correlate well with velocity dispersions of either galaxy discs or pseudobulges .    in the sample of @xcite , only two smbhs in pseudobulge systems",
    "appear to lie above the classical @xmath2@xmath1 relation for bulges , with the rest being somewhat below the relation , in a qualitative agreement with @xcite .",
    "if these observations are confirmed in the future , then this is clearly very strongly at odds with the theory developed above : because discs are difficult to affect by agn feedback simply due to geometrical arguments ( see also simulations by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a smbh fed by a disc should be able to grow more massive by at least a factor of a few ( compare equation [ new_msigma ] to equation [ msig ] ) than a smbh embedded in a bulge .",
    "in fact , theoretically one may expect disc smbhs to be even more massive : as noted below equation [ pdisc ] , this is the absolute minimum to which the smbh can grow if fed through the disc because in general agn feedback impacting a given disc radius can be diluted at smaller radii or be beamed away from the disc ( neither of these effects is included in equation [ new_msigma ] ) .",
    "the simplest interpretation of this result is to accept that star formation in large scale discs is too efficient a process and so significant gas flow into the sub - pc vicinity of smbh is suppressed , leading to a quenching of smbh fueling ( see the arguments by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we conclude that these discs do _ not _ extend to the smbh sphere of influence ( between 1 and 10 pc , depending on smbh mass ) , as suggested in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "@xcite proposed a star - burst disc model which appears to overcome the difficulties noted by @xcite .",
    "specifically , they argue that the star formation rate in the disc is limited by the action of energy and momentum feedback from massive stars and supernovae , allowing some fuel to trickle down all the way to the nucleus . however , one problem with @xcite argument applied to the inner galaxy is a mismatch of time scales . gravitational collapse of the disc is expected to take place on the dynamical time scale @xcite , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the smbh mass in units of @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is radius in units of parsec .",
    "@xcite show that the disc cooling time is much shorter than the dynamical time in their model . on the other hand , massive stars dominating the feedback release energy on a time scale of a few million years .",
    "therefore , for radii where @xmath74 is much shorter than the lifetime of the massive stars , the feedback might be released too slowly , i.e. , only when the disc would already have collapsed gravitationally .    in conclusion",
    ", we believe that the observations of @xcite imply that smbhs do _ not _ grow by a large scale ( e.g. tens of pc to @xmath75kpc ) discs .",
    "surveys show little evidence for correlation between the orientation of jets from agn and the large  scale structure of their host galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this shows that the inner @xmath76 pc scale gas discs feeding agn are also uncorrelated with the large scale discs of host galaxies . in our own galaxy ,",
    "the observed young stellar discs in the galactic centre @xcite are inclined at very large angles to the galactic plane .",
    "this indicates that the disc stars originated from a deposition of one or two gas clouds with angular momentum directions very different from that of the galactic disc @xcite .",
    "an attractive physical picture for agn feeding that explains these observations and the results of our paper is that smbhs in general are fuelled by stochastic deposition of gas clouds with randomly oriented angular momentum , as sketched in the right panel of figure 1 .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite demonstrated that this situation may be realised in an initially coherently rotating gas sphere if strong turbulence ( driven by supernova explosions due to star formation in the bulge , for example ) is present .",
    "convergent turbulent gas flows lead to formation of high density regions travelling through the rest of the gas nearly ballistically",
    ". a small fraction of such regions will be on nearly radial orbits that impact the innermost parsecs of smbh directly without going through a large scale disc .",
    "@xcite argued that such flows create small ( pc - scale ) warped discs with a fluctuating orientation .",
    "these discs are able to feed the smbh at much higher rates than the flat discs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) without becoming self - gravitating , effectively due to a much faster transfer of gas through the inner parsecs .",
    "we therefore suggest that the absence of an observed @xmath2@xmath1 relation for pure disc galaxies or pseudobulges provides observational support for the chaotic / ballistic mode of smbh feeding . in our interpretation of the data ,",
    "the lack of classical bulges in these galaxies shut down the most efficient channel by which smbh grow  the cold chaotic accretion  and therefore led to their smbhs growing mainly by planar ( disk or bar ) accretion which we argue is inefficient .",
    "having said this , we note that it remains to be seen if @xmath33 relation for chaotic streams conforms to the relations obtained by @xcite .",
    "we shall now remark on limitations of our work .",
    "first of all , we only considered the momentum feedback here , whereas more complete treatments show that the smbh outflow switches from momentum driving to energy driving at larger radii @xcite .",
    "however , this is not likely to affect our conclusions significantly because it is the momentum - driven part of the agn feedback process that constitutes the bottle neck for removing the gas to infinity @xcite .",
    "furthermore , numerical simulations of zubovas and nayakshin ( 2012 ) that include both the momentum and energy feedback forms confirm the points made here on the difficulty of expelling a massive dense gas disc for the particular case of the milky way .    in common with other analytical papers on the subject ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) we have also used an isothermal potential .",
    "however the discussion in the end of section [ sec : spherical ] shows that this has little effect on momentum driven outflows studied here .",
    "zubovas & king ( 2012 , in preparation ) have extended this result to large scale energy - driven outflows .",
    "a more serious worry is that our theoretical model predicts @xmath77 , whereas different authors now find that @xmath1 ranges from somewhat below @xmath78 to as high as 6 ( cf .",
    "references in the introduction ) .",
    "one possible explanation for this within our momentum - driven feedback model is that the steeper slope for samples that _ combine different types of galaxies _ actually results from a superposition of several @xmath77 relations for different galaxies vertically offset in mass zubovas & king ( 2012 , in preparation ) .",
    "future theoretical and observational work is needed to resolve this issue .",
    "finally , given our smbh feeding focus , we do not attempt to relate the gas discs we consider here to exponential _ stellar _ discs observed in real galaxies .",
    "this would require an additional multi - parameter model for transformation of gas into stars and is beyond the scope of our paper .",
    "previous analytical treatments of the @xmath2@xmath1 relation have modelled the impact of momentum driven agn feedback on a spherical gas distribution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we have shown analytically that if smbh is fed by a large scale gas disc , there exists a `` disc @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath1 relation '' .",
    "the latter has the same shape as the `` spherical '' @xmath2  @xmath1 relation @xcite but is offset to higher masses by a factor of a few to ten , realistically .",
    "we emphasise that the precise value of the offset is model dependent , but the general trend is undeniable even for agn feedback models not considered here , such as energy - driven models ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this follows simply from the geometrical argument first emphasised by @xcite : a dense flat disc and even more so a bar presents a much smaller target for agn feedback to act upon than a quasi - spherical gas distribution , and therefore much more massive smbhs could be built if their masses were limited by a feedback argument",
    ". we may further allude here to the analogy from the field of massive star formation , where radiation pressure was once thought to limit stellar growth ; instead , recent simulations by @xcite show that accretion through a disc ( which we note is stable to self - gravitational instabilities on the scales of the simulations ) is very efficient as radiation is channelled away from the disc . if a similar situation applied in galaxy formation , smbhs would grow as long as there is fuel in the massive galaxy - wide discs or bars .",
    "one could then expect smbh becoming comparable in mass to galaxy gas discs themselves , which is clearly observationally not the case .",
    "reconciliation of this theoretical result with observations leads to interesting and significant conclusions about the dominant mode by which smbhs grow in galaxies .",
    "@xcite showed that pseudobulge galaxies tend to have undermassive smbhs , and @xcite showed that barred galaxies tend to have smbhs that are a factor of @xmath11 to ten smaller than elliptical galaxies at the same velocity dispersion . while @xcite argue , in variance with the above authors , that that smbhs do not even correlate with velocity dispersions of galaxy discs and pseudobulges , we note that their results also show that smbhs in pseudobulge systems are typically undermassive with respect to their classical bulge cousins ( e.g. , see fig . 2 in * ?",
    "we suggest that these observations hint that smbhs in most galaxies ( 1 ) do not grow by accretion of gas through @xmath32 kpc gas discs , most likely because gas is turned into stars too efficiently , and ( 2 ) grow via a mode directly linked to existence of a classical quasi - spherical bulge . in this case",
    "it is natural that the smbh in galaxies lacking the classical bulge ( pseudobulge galaxies ) are undermassive , and it is also natural that smbhs do not correlate with galaxy discs . for the smbh accretion modes physically linked to classical bulges we suggest the stochastic @xcite or ballistic @xcite accretion modes in which the bulge is the source of low and fluctuating in direction angular momentum material .",
    "an additional indirect evidence supporting our conclusions comes from recent semi - analytical models of galaxy formation by @xcite .",
    "these authors show that semi - analytical models which turn off smbh feeding during pseudobulge growth episodes driven by secular instabilities ( bars ) provide a much better fit to the data than models that allow a concurrent growth of smbh and pseudobulges ( see fig . 1 in * ? ? ?",
    "we here thus provide a physical interpretation of this empirical result : `` fragmentation catastrophe '' of the outer cold and massive regions of agn discs makes them too susceptible to star formation , so that not enough gas trickles down to the smbh @xcite .    to avoid confusion ,",
    "we emphasise that we do _ not _ argue that small ( e.g. , sub - parsec ) scale accretion discs are unimportant for smbh growth . in the chaotic accretion picture , there will always be a non - vanishing amount of angular momentum associated with the accretion flow and this results in the formation of `` small '' by galactic standards discs ( @xmath79 pc , depending on the smbh mass and the accretion rate , cf .",
    "* ) that are resilient to agn feedback ( as we show in the appendix ) .",
    "rather , our key point is that the origin of material that feeds these small discs is distinct from the larger scale ( with respect to the smbh s sphere of influence ) disc or a galactic bar , and the orientation of these smaller - scale agn discs is likely to be chaotic because of the manner in which the quasi - spherical inflows that feeds these discs fluctuates in time .",
    "we also note that large scale galaxy - wide gas discs and gas bars are obviously important for galaxy formation as a whole , likely accounting for a significant fraction of all stars formed and also for a radial redistribution of gas and stars within the galaxy , but we see no clear evidence that these features are able to channel their gas all the way to the smbhs .",

    "we have argued above that agn feedback can affect a large scale gas disc expelling the gas outward just as it can for a spherical distribution of gas .",
    "we now show that there exists a critical radius within which this argument no longer holds : the disc there is resilient to agn feedback .    inside the smbh s sphere of influence , marked by the radius @xmath80 ,",
    "the gravitational potential is dominated by the smbh and so we can replace @xmath81 with @xmath2 . for a smbh on the @xmath12@xmath1 relation , the smbh s radius of influence",
    "is given by @xmath82 as the result , the critical momentum flux striking the edge of the disc must be @xmath83 using @xmath84 for a marginally self - gravitating disc again , we arrive at the requirement that @xmath85 this can be satisfied at radii greater than @xmath86 where @xmath71 is the smbh mass in units of @xmath72 . recalling that we assumed that @xmath87 , we conclude that inside the `` feedback radius '' @xmath88 given by @xmath89 , \\label{rfb}\\ ] ] momentum feedback by the smbh is unable to affect a self - gravitating disc .",
    "physically the significance of this feedback radius can be appreciated by considering a major gas mass deposition event  say , the infall of a very massive giant molecular cloud or a merger with a gas - rich galaxy that dumps a significant amount of gas into the inner galaxy .",
    "this gas will settle into a disc because it is very likely to have a non zero net specific angular momentum . at @xmath90 ,",
    "the disc can not be expelled by the agn , whereas at @xmath90 it may as shown in the main body of the paper .    somewhat counter - intuitively , gas closest to the smbh is actually hardest to expel to infinity ( although this becomes clearer if one considers that smbh s gravity is enormous in the inner @xmath32pc ) .",
    "deposition of a small cloud at @xmath91 may be much more promising for agn feeding than having a vast amount of gas at @xmath92 as the latter is more easily affected by agn feedback and star formation ."
