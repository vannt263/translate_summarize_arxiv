    "the notion of a weakly isolated horizon @xcite extracts from killing horizons the minimal properties required to establish the zeroth and the first laws of black hole mechanics .",
    "thus , the notion captures the idea that the horizon itself is in equilibrium , allowing for dynamical processes and radiation in the exterior region .",
    "the resulting isolated horizon framework has had several applications : i ) for fundamental physics , in addition to extending black hole mechanics from stationary situations @xcite , it has led to a phenomenological model of hairy black holes @xcite which accounts for many of their key qualitative features ; ii ) in computational relativity , it has provided tools to extract physics from numerical simulations of gravitational collapse and black hole mergers at late times @xcite ; and , iii ) for quantum gravity , it provided a point of departure for a statistical mechanical calculation of entropy , based on quantum geometry @xcite .",
    "these applications feature gravity _ minimally _ coupled to matter such as scalar fields , maxwell fields , dilatons , yang - mills fields and higgs fields @xcite .",
    "a common element in all these diverse situations is that the first law always takes the form , @xmath0 suggesting that a multiple of the surface gravity @xmath1 should be interpreted as the temperature and a multiple of the horizon area @xmath2 as entropy .",
    "this is striking because , irrespective of the choice of matter fields _ and their couplings to each other _ , the entropy depends _ only _ on a single geometrical quantity , @xmath2 , and is independent of the values of matter fields or their charges at the horizon .",
    "on the other hand , using killing horizons , jacobson , kang and myers @xcite and iyer and wald @xcite have analyzed general classes of theories , showing that the situation would be qualitatively different if the matter is non - minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "now , _ the expression of entropy depends also on matter fields on the horizon_.    specifically , consider a scalar field @xmath3 coupled to gravity through the action [ g_ab , ] = ^4x , [ action1 ] where @xmath4 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath5 and @xmath6 is a potential for the scalar field .",
    "then , the analysis of @xcite predicts that the entropy is given by [ s ] s = ( f ( ) ^2v ) . where the integral is taken on any 2-sphere cross - section of the horizon .",
    "if the scalar field takes a constant value @xmath7 on the horizon , the proportionality to area _ is _ restored , @xmath8\\ , { a_\\delta}$ ] , but even in this case the constant now depends on @xmath7 .",
    "thus , non - minimal coupling introduces a _ qualitative _ difference .",
    "it is natural to ask if the isolated horizon framework can incorporate such situations .",
    "apart from extending that framework , the incorporation would also serve three more specific purposes .",
    "first , we will have a richer class of examples .",
    "in particular the analysis based on killing horizons requires a globally defined killing field which admits a bifurcate horizon .",
    "while such solutions admitting scalar hair are known to exist if the cosmological constant @xmath9 is non - zero @xcite , analytic work @xcite and numerical evidence @xcite suggests that such solutions do not exist if @xmath9 vanishes .",
    "the analysis @xcite of the initial value problem based on isolated horizons , on the other hand , can be used to show that solutions admitting weakly isolated horizons would exist at least locally , whence the isolated horizon analysis would not trivialize in the @xmath10 case .",
    "the second point is more technical . in @xcite , a large class of theories",
    "is considered but under the assumption that the action depends only on the metric , the curvature and matter fields ; first order actions which depend also on the gravitational connection are not incorporated .",
    "the isolated horizon analysis @xcite , on the other hand , is based on first order actions .",
    "hence , incorporation of non - minimal couplings in this framework would add to the robustness of the final results of @xcite .",
    "finally , the analysis based on killing horizons does not provide an action principle or a hamiltonian framework which can be used for a non - perturbative quantization .",
    "the isolated horizon framework does , thereby paving the way for a fully statistical mechanical treatment based on quantum gravity .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to extend the isolated horizon framework to incorporate non - minimally coupled scalar fields of eq ( [ action1 ] ) .",
    "we will find that the entropy is indeed given by ( [ s ] ) ; the main result of @xcite is robust . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will show that this analysis provides the point of departure for quantum theory and the fully quantum mechanical calculation assigns the same entropy to the isolated horizon .    since the couplings of matter fields among themselves do not play a direct role in our analysis , in the rest of the paper the term ` non - minimal coupling '",
    "will refer to the couplings of matter fields to gravity .",
    "we will first recall the second and first order actions of interest and then specify the first order action that will be used in the rest of the paper . for simplicity , in the first part we will omit surface terms and restore them only at the end .",
    "let us then start with the action : [ g_ab , ] = _ ^4x [ action2 ] on a 4-dimensional manifold @xmath11 . in general relativity ,",
    "one is often interested in the case @xmath12 with @xmath13 a constant .",
    "then @xmath3 satisfies a non - minimally coupled equation @xmath14 .",
    "however , our analysis is not tied to this case .    as indicated in section [ s1 ] , in the isolated horizon framework",
    "it is simpler to work in the first order formalism .",
    "the first order action for non - minimally coupled scalar fields was discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us begin by recalling the main difference from the simpler , minimally coupled theory . in the case of minimal couplings , the first order action is given just by replacing the scalar curvature term in the second order action by an appropriate contraction of the tetrads with the curvature of the connection @xcite . in the present case , there is an additional term because derivatives of the scalar field appear when one integrates by parts to obtain the equations of motion of the connection .",
    "more precisely , if we work with tetrads @xmath15 and lorentz connections @xmath16 , the first order action is given by : [ e , a , ] = _ ^4x e , [ action3 ] where [ g ] k(y ) = [ 1 + ( 3/16 g ) ( f(y))^2/f(y ) ] .to show that this action is equivalent to the second order action ( [ action2 ] ) , it suffices to solve the equation of motion for the connection @xmath17 , substitute the solution in ( [ action3 ] ) and show that the result reduces to ( [ action2 ] ) .",
    "variation with respect to @xmath17 yields the equation of motion for the connection : d_a(f ( ) e e^a_[i e^b_j])=0 .",
    "[ eqa1 ] assuming that the _ rescaled _ tetrad @xmath18 , with @xmath19 , is well - defined and non - degenerate , it follows that @xmath17 is the unique lorentz connection compatible with @xmath20 . substituting this solution in the expression of the curvature ,",
    "we obtain : e^a_i e^b_j f_ab^ij(a ) = ( ) e^a_i e^b_j f_ab^ij(a ) = f ( ) [ rhat ] where @xmath21 is the scalar curvature of the metric @xmath22 .",
    "hence , in terms of the metric @xmath23 , the action ( [ action3 ] ) reduces to the second order form [ g , ] = _ ^4x [ action4 ] finally , using the standard relation between the scalar curvatures of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , we recover , up to a surface term , the second order action ( [ action1 ] ) we began with .. we will see in the next section that on an isolated horizon @xmath3 is ` time independent ' .",
    "it then follows that the horizon contribution to the surface term vanishes whence the two action principles are in fact equivalent . ]",
    "thus , when @xmath20 is smooth and non - degenerate , the first order action ( [ action3 ] ) is equivalent to the more familiar one .",
    "however , we wish to emphasize that , for our purposes , it is the first order action that is fundamental and this action as well as the hamiltonian framework developed in this paper continue to be well - defined even when @xmath26 vanishes or @xmath15 becomes degenerate .    to make contact with literature on isolated horizons , it will be convenient to rewrite the first order action ( [ action3 ] ) in terms of forms .",
    "let us define the two form @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the co - tetrads so that @xmath29 .",
    "the action now takes the form , [ e , a , ] & = & _ ( f ( ) ^ijf_ij+ k ( ) ^- v()^4 ) + & - & _ a^ij_ij , [ actionforms ] where @xmath30 denotes the hodge - dual , @xmath31 is the volume 4-form on @xmath11 defined by the tetrad @xmath15 and where we have explicitly included the surface term that is needed to make the action differentiable . in the remainder of this paper",
    "we shall use this form of the action .",
    "we conclude with two remarks on the second order action .",
    "consider again the second order action ( [ action2 ] ) . in the sector of the theory",
    "in which @xmath26 is nowhere zero , we can pass to a conformally related metric @xmath32 and to a new field @xmath33 where @xmath34 is defined by [ f ] f(x ) = ^x ^1/2 y .then the action ( [ action2 ] ) can be rewritten as : [ |g_ab , ] = _ ^4x [ action5 ] where the potential for the scalar field @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 .",
    "thus , on this sector , the theory is equivalent to a minimally coupled scalar field @xmath35 on @xmath37 . in the commonly used terminology , ( [ action2 ] )",
    "expresses the theory in the jordan conformal frame while ( [ action5 ] ) expresses it in the einstein frame .",
    "how stringent is the restriction that @xmath26 be everywhere positive ?",
    "the equations of motion following from ( [ action2 ] ) are : 0&= & g^ab _ a _ b + r + + ( r_ab - g_ab ) & = & _ a _ b - ( ^c _ c - ^c _ c f ( ) + v ( ) ) g_ab + & & + _ a _ b f ( ) therefore , if @xmath26 were to vanish in an open set , the einstein tensor is undetermined there .",
    "consequently , it is likely that the cauchy problem would not be well - posed . indeed ,",
    "if the potential admits a minimum at @xmath38 , a constant , then on an open set on which @xmath26 vanishes , @xmath38 , and @xmath5 _ any _ metric with @xmath39 would satisfy the field equations .",
    "by contrast , if @xmath26 is nowhere zero , as we just saw , the field equations are equivalent to those of minimally coupled scalar field and the cauchy problem is then well - posed",
    ". therefore , from the standard viewpoint one adopts in general relativity , the requirement that @xmath26 does not vanish on an open set is physically quite reasonable .",
    "let us first adapt the basic definitions to accommodate non - minimal couplings .    a _ non - expanding horizon _",
    "@xmath40 is a null , 3-dimensional sub - manifold of @xmath41 , topologically @xmath42 such that : + i ) the expansion @xmath43 of every null normal @xmath44 to @xmath40 vanishes ; + ii ) the scalar field @xmath3 satisfies @xmath45 ; and + iii ) equations of motion hold on @xmath40 . + here and in what follows @xmath46 denotes equality restricted to points of @xmath40 .",
    "the previous papers on isolated horizons assumed , in place of ii ) , that the matter stress - energy satisfies a very weak energy condition which , through the raychaudhuri equation , implied that matter fields are lie dragged by @xmath47 . non - minimally coupled scalar fields violate even that energy condition .",
    "therefore , we directly assume ii ) which , it turns out , suffices for our purposes .",
    "( this is the only change in the basic definitions needed to accommodate non - minimal couplings . )",
    "this condition captures the intuitive idea that , since the horizon @xmath40 is in equilibrium , the scalar field should be time - independent on @xmath40 .",
    "the definition also implies that the intrinsic ( degenerate ) metric @xmath48 on @xmath40 is time independent ; @xmath49 .    as in the minimally coupled case ,",
    "the space - time covariant derivative @xmath50 induces a natural derivative operator @xmath51 on @xmath40 such that @xmath52 and @xmath53 for some 1-form @xmath54 on @xmath40 . while @xmath51 is canonical , the 1-form @xmath54 depends on the choice of the ( future - directed ) null normal ; under rescaling @xmath55 we have @xmath56 .",

    "as in @xcite , to establish the zeroth and the first law of black hole mechanics , we will not need the stronger notion of isolated horizons .    as in @xcite , an immediate consequence of these boundary conditions",
    "is the zeroth law . since @xmath62 , by the cartan identity",

    ". then @xmath77 , where the flat derivative operator @xmath78 on internal indices will be assumed to be compatible with ( i.e. annihilate ) the internal tetrad on @xmath40 .",
    "thus the gauge freedom _ at _ @xmath40 is restricted . ]",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath3 on @xmath66 . since the boundary conditions require @xmath80 and @xmath81 , in each history that features in the variation , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we will now use this information to show that the first order action ( [ actionforms ] ) leads to a well - defined variational principle .",
    "if we denote the variables @xmath84 collectively as @xmath85 , we have : [ ] = _ m e [ ] + _ m j [ , ] [ var1 ] where @xmath86= 0 $ ] is the equation of motion for @xmath85 and the current 3-form @xmath87 is given by : j [ , ] = ( f ( ) ^ij a_ij ) + k()^ * [ u1 ] thus , the action principle is well - defined if and only if the integral of @xmath87 over the boundary of @xmath11 vanishes .",
    "now , since all fields are kept fixed on @xmath66 , @xmath87 itself vanishes there .",
    "similarly , the boundary conditions at spatial infinity ensure , as usual , that the boundary term at infinity also vanishes .",
    "therefore , we only need to check the boundary integral on the horizon @xmath40 . since @xmath88 , the second term in @xmath87 vanishes . to evaluate the first term ,",
    "let us first calculate @xmath89 on @xmath40 .",
    "we first note that @xmath70 can be expressed in terms of tetrads and @xmath54 : since @xmath90 using the equation of motion @xmath91 which holds on @xmath40 ( because the definition of a non - expanding horizon ensures that the field equations hold on @xmath40 ) , we have a_b^ij = 2 ( _ b p ) ^[i n^j ] + 2 _ a ^[i n^j ] + c_b ^ij + _ b u^ij for some @xmath92 and @xmath93 satisfying @xmath94 and @xmath95 . now , since the internal tetrad is fixed once and for all on @xmath40 , independently of the choice of the history under consideration , variations of these internal vectors vanishes .",
    "similarly , since @xmath96 is the unique direction field ( in the cotangent space at any point of @xmath40 ) which is orthogonal to all tangent vectors to @xmath40 in _ any _ history , @xmath97 is necessarily proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the variation @xmath89 is given by : a_b^ij = 2 ( _ b p + _ b ) ^[i n^j ] + c_a^ij + u^ij _ b[deltaa ]    we can now substitute ( [ deltaa ] ) in the surface term in @xmath98 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath47 is a null normal to @xmath40 and the algebraic properties of @xmath92 and @xmath93 on @xmath40 , we obtain : _ j = _ f ( ) ( ( p ) + ) = 0 where , in the last step , we have used @xmath99 and @xmath100 . thus the surface term in ( [ var1 ] ) vanishes because of the boundary conditions , whence the action ( [ actionforms ] ) is functionally differentiable . from discussion of section [ s2 ]",
    "we know that the equations of motion @xmath86 = 0 $ ] are the expected ones .",
    "as in the previous papers on isolated horizons , we will use a covariant phase space .",
    "thus , our phase space @xmath101 will consist of _ solutions _ @xmath102 to the field equations on @xmath11 which are asymptotically flat and admit @xmath103)$ ] as a weakly isolated horizon .",
    "( the precise kinematical structure fixed on @xmath40 is listed in section [ s3 ] . ) as usual , the symplectic current is constructed from the anti - symmetrized second variation of the action , where one can now use the equations of motion _ but the variations are no longer restricted to vanish on the initial and final surfaces @xmath66_. to express the resulting symplectic structure in a convenient form , it is convenient to introduce a scalar potential @xmath104 of surface gravity @xmath105 on @xmath40 via : ^a _ a = _ , _ s^- _ = 0where , as in fig 1 , @xmath106 is the 2-sphere on which @xmath40 intersects @xmath107 .",
    "( note that @xmath104 is independent of the choice of vector @xmath47 within the equivalent class @xmath108 $ ] . )",
    "then , the symplectic structure is given by : [ sym ] ( _ 1 , _ 2 ) = & & _ mtr + & + & _ m  k ( ) + & + & _ s _ , where @xmath109 is any partial cauchy surface which intersects @xmath40 in @xmath110 . thus ,",
    "as in the minimally coupled case @xcite , the symplectic structure has a surface term which again comes from the ` gravitational part ' of the action  the first term in ( [ actionforms]) but now depends also on the value of the scalar field on @xmath40 .    to obtain the first law , as in @xcite we need to make an additional assumption",
    ": we will restrict ourselves to the case when the weakly isolated horizons are of symmetry type ii , i.e. , _ axi - symmetric_. thus , we will fix a rotational vector field @xmath111 on @xmath40 ( normalized so its closed orbits have affine length equal to @xmath112 ) and restrict ourselves to the part of the phase space where the fields @xmath113 are all lie - dragged by @xmath111 .",
    "note that the symmetry restriction is imposed _ only _ at @xmath40 ; there is no assumption that the fields in the bulk are axi - symmetric .",
    "following @xcite , let us first define the horizon angular momentum . consider any extension @xmath114 of @xmath111 on @xmath40 to the bulk space - time @xmath11 of which tends to an asymptotic rotational killing field at spatial infinity .",
    "the question is whether motions along @xmath115 induce canonical transformations on the phase space and , if so , what its generating function @xmath116 is .",
    "the simplest way to analyze this issue is to set @xmath117 , and ask whether there exists a phase space function @xmath118 such that ( , _ ) = j^ for all tangent vectors @xmath119 to the phase space .",
    "the analysis is completely analogous to that of @xcite .",
    "however , since one has to use both the field equations obeyed by @xmath120 and the linearized field equations satisfied by @xmath121 , the calculation is significantly more complicated because these equations are more involved now .",
    "however , the final result is rather simple : ( , _ ) = where @xmath122 is the volume 2-form on the 2-sphere under consideration .",
    "hence , as is usual in generally covariant theories , @xmath116 consists only of surface terms . the term at infinity can be shown to be the total angular momentum associated with @xmath115 .",
    "it is then natural to interpret the surface integral at @xmath40 as the isolated horizon angular momentum : [ j ] j^_= - _ s _ ^a_a f .",
    "thus , the only difference from the minimally coupled case @xcite is that volume 2-form @xmath122 there is now replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "we are now ready to obtain the first law . to introduce the notion of energy",
    ", we have to consider vector fields @xmath124 in space - time @xmath11 representing time translations . since we are dealing with a generally covariant theory , what matters is only the boundary values of @xmath124 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath124 must approach an asymptotic time translation at infinity and reduce to a symmetry vector field representing time translations on the horizon : t^a = b _ ( , t)^a - _ ( t ) ^a where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are constants on the horizon and , as the notation suggests , @xmath127 depends not only on @xmath124 but also on our choice of the null normal @xmath47 in @xmath128 $ ] ( such that @xmath129 is unchanged under the rescalings of @xmath44 in @xmath108 $ ] . ) at infinity , all metrics tend to a universal flat metric whence the asymptotic values of the symmetry vector fields are also universal . at the horizon ,",
    "on the other hand , we are in a strong field region and the geometry is not universal .",
    "therefore , there is ambiguity in what one means by the ` same ' symmetry vector field in two different space - times .",
    "for example , in the kerr family , for the ` standard ' time - translation , @xmath130 in the schwarzschild space - time but non - zero if the space - time has angular momentum .",
    "therefore , a priori we must allow for the possibility that the horizon values of @xmath124 ( i.e. , the constants @xmath131 ) may vary from one space - time to another . in the numerical relativity terminology these are ` live ' vector fields .",
    "this subtlety has nothing to do with non - minimal couplings and also arose in all previous work on isolated horizons .",
    "again , the key question is whether there exists a phase space function @xmath132 such that @xmath133 . using the equations of motion and their linearized version",
    ", one can show that @xmath133 consists of two surface terms .",
    "let us focus on the one at the horizon . a long calculation yields : ( , _ t )",
    "_ & = & _ s _ + & = & + where @xmath134 is the surface gravity ( i.e. acceleration ) of the vector field @xmath129 on @xmath40 .",
    "( the surface term at infinity is precisely @xmath135 . ) thus , while the diffeomorphisms generated by @xmath124 give rise to a flow on the covariant phase space , in general this flow may _ not _ be hamiltonian .",
    "it is so if and only if there exists a phase space function @xmath136 such that [ 1law ] e^t_= + , i.e. , if and only if the first law is satisfied .",
    "thus , as in the case of minimal coupling @xcite , the first law arises as a necessary and sufficient condition for the flow generated by @xmath124 to be hamiltonian .    as in @xcite , one can show that there exist infinitely many vector fields @xmath124 for which the right side of ( [ 1law ] ) is an exact variation and provide an explicit procedure to construct them .",
    "each of these vector fields generates a hamiltonian flow and gives rise to a first law .",
    "thus , the overall structure is the same as in the case of minimal coupling .",
    "however , there is a key difference in the expression of the multiple of @xmath137 : while it is the variation in the horizon area @xmath138 in the case of minimal coupling , now it is the variation of the integral of @xmath139 on a horizon cross - section .",
    "consequently , the entropy is now given by ( [ s ] ) .",
    "as in @xcite , @xmath136 and @xmath134 depend on the choice of the time translation @xmath124 , _ while entropy does not_.    finally , we note that if the horizon geometry fails to be axi - symmetric , there is no natural notion of angular momentum .",
    "however , we can still repeat the argument by seeking ` time - translation ' vector fields @xmath124 with @xmath140 , the evolution along which is hamiltonian .",
    "such vector fields exist .",
    "thus , there is still a first law and the entropy still given by ( [ s ] ) and is again independent of the choice of @xmath124 .",
    "we will conclude with some remarks .",
    "+ i ) it may first appear that the surface integrals in the expressions ( [ j ] ) of the horizon angular momentum and ( [ 1law ] ) of the first law arise directly from the surface term in the symplectic structure ( [ sym ] ) .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "in fact in the detailed calculation the contributions of the surface term in ( [ sym ] ) to @xmath141 and @xmath142 vanish identically !",
    "the key surface terms in ( [ j ] ) and ( [ 1law ] ) come from integrations by part of the bulk term in the symplectic structure , required to relate the integrands to the field equations satisfied by @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "the overall situation is the same as in @xcite for minimal coupling but these calculations are now considerably more complicated .",
    "+ ii ) conceptually , it may appear strange that the flow generated by @xmath124 is not always hamiltonian .",
    "however , this is in fact the ` rule ' rather than the ` exception ' .",
    "consider the asymptotically flat situation without boundaries and suppose we allow ` live ' vector fields .",
    "now , a live asymptotic time - translation vector field @xmath124 may point in the same direction at infinity but may have a norm which varies from space - time to space - time .",
    "( indeed , it may even point in different directions in different space - times . )",
    "the flow generated by such vector fields in the phase space fails to be hamiltonian in general ; it is hamiltonian if and only of the asymptotic value of the vector field is the same in all space - times ; i.e. , @xmath124 defines the _ same _ time translation of the fixed flat metric at infinity in all space - times in the phase space . as mentioned above , in the case of the isolated horizon , it is not a priori clear what the ` same ' time translation on @xmath40 means .",
    "the pleasant surprise is that it is the first law that settles this issue .",
    "+ iii ) in the einstein - maxwell theory , one can exploit the black hole uniqueness theorem to select a _",
    "canonical _ evolution field @xmath124 on @xmath40 of each space - time in the phase space @xcite .",
    "there is then a canonical notion of horizon energy which can be taken to be the horizon mass and a canonical first law .",
    "in the non - minimally coupled theory now under consideration , it is no longer true that there is precisely a 2-parameter family of globally stationary solutions .",
    "hence , one can not select a canonical vector field or a canonical first law .",
    "consequently , although the expression of entropy is unambiguous , that of horizon mass is not ; we only have a @xmath145-dependent notion of the horizon energy @xmath146 .",
    "nonetheless , as with hairy black holes @xcite , one can extract physically useful information from these expressions .",
    "+ iv ) while we focused in this paper on 3 + 1 general relativity without cosmological constant , it is straightforward to incorporate 2 + 1 dimensional isolated horizons @xcite and the presence of cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "in particular , our results apply to the 2 + 1 dimensional black hole studied in @xcite , where , using euclidean methods , entropy was found to be @xmath147 .",
    "the ` 2/3 ' factor , which was left as a puzzle , is naturally accounted for by the fact that entropy depends also on the scalar field via ( [ s ] ) .",
    "we have seen that , in presence of a weakly isolated horizon internal boundary , there is a well - defined action principle and hamiltonian framework also for non - minimally coupled scalar fields . while the overall structure is the same as in the minimally coupled case , the first law is now modified , suggesting that now the entropy is given by ( [ s ] ) .",
    "thus we have extended the main result of jacobson , kang and myers @xcite and iyer and wald @xcite from stationary space - times to those admitting only isolated horizons and shown that the result holds also in first order frameworks .",
    "this is however only a small extension because whereas @xcite and @xcite consider a very large class of theories , here we considered only non - minimally coupled scalar fields .    from the discussion of section [ s2 ]",
    ", it follows that we can make a conformal transformation of the tetrad @xmath148 and a field redefinition of @xmath3 to cast action ( [ actionforms ] ) in to that of the minimally coupled einstein - scalar field theory with tetrad @xmath149 and scalar field @xmath35 related algebraically to @xmath3 ( via ( [ f ] ) . ) it is then natural to ask if our results would have been the same if we had worked from the beginning in this minimally coupled ` einstein frame ' rather than the original non - minimally coupled ` jordan frame ' .",
    "one s first reaction may be that it is obvious that the notions of angular momentum , energy and entropy of a field configuration should not depend on whether we regard it as a solution to the first theory or the second , whence the results must be the same .",
    "however , this is not a priori clear .",
    "for example , it is not self - evident that @xmath57)$ ] is even a weakly isolated horizon for @xmath150 .",
    "a more subtle point is that there could be tension because even when a state is shared by two theories , its properties _ can _ depend on the theory we choose to analyze it in .",
    "a striking example is provided by the magnetically charged reissner - nordstrom space - times : while they are stable in the einstein - maxwell theory , they are unstable when regarded as solutions to the einstein - yang - mills equations @xcite . in the isolated horizon framework , this difference can be directly traced to the fact that the _ horizon _ mass is ` theory dependent ' @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for a fixed magnetically charged reissner - nordstrom space - time , the horizon mass in the einstein - maxwell theory is the same as the adm mass while that in the einstein - yang - mills theory is lower .",
    "the difference can be radiated away , paving the way for an instability in the einstein - yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the isolated horizon framework even provides a qualitative relation between the horizon area and the frequency of unstable modes in this theory .",
    "it is therefore worthwhile to compare the results obtained here in the jordan frame with those one would obtain in the einstein frame .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : +    * @xmath57)$ ] is a non - expanding horizon in @xmath151 if and only if it is one in @xmath152 .",
    "this follows because @xmath80 . *",
    "the intrinsic horizon metrics are related by @xmath153 , and the volume 3-forms by @xmath154 . for any choice of the null normal @xmath47 , @xmath155 . since the surface gravity is given by @xmath156 , and @xmath80",
    "implies @xmath157 , the two surface gravities are equal : @xmath158 . * in type ii horizons ,",
    "@xmath159 because @xmath160 . as a result ,",
    "angular momenta @xmath161 computed in the einstein and jordan frames agree .",
    "* diffeomorphisms generated by a vector field @xmath124 on @xmath11 generate a hamiltonian flow on the phase space in the einstein frame if and only if there exists a phase space function @xmath162 such that + [ 1lawein ] |e^t_= + , where @xmath163 is the horizon area in the einstein frame .",
    "since the two volume 2-forms are related by @xmath164 , it follows that the right sides of ( [ 1law ] ) and ( [ 1lawein ] ) are identical , whence the values of the entropy and horizon energy calculated in the two frames are the same .",
    "thus , the main results are the same in the two frames ; the situation is different from that with the einstein - maxwell and einstein - yang - mills theories discussed above .",
    "this difference can be traced back to the fact that while the phase spaces of those two theories are quite different , _ in the case when @xmath139 is everywhere positive _ , the phase spaces of the minimally and non - minimally coupled theories are naturally isomorphic .",
    "note however that the action ( [ actionforms ] ) , the boundary conditions at @xmath40 , the symplectic structure ( [ sym ] ) , and the vector field @xmath165 on the phase space are all well - defined _ also in the case when @xmath139 vanishes on an open set _ of compact closure away from @xmath40 , so long as @xmath166 remains everywhere smooth .",
    "vanishes in an open set , the symplectic structure at that point of the phase space acquires additional degenerate directions , i.e. , the notion of ` gauge ' is now enlarged .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze whether the evolution is unique modulo this extended gauge freedom even though , as pointed out in section [ s2 ] , the cauchy problem is ill - posed in the standard sense . ] therefore , in the first order framework used here , the derivation of the first law in the jordan frame goes through even when one can not pass to the einstein frame through a conformal transformation .    at first sight",
    ", the appearance of the non - geometrical , scalar field in the expression of entropy seems like a non - trivial obstacle to the entropy calculation in loop quantum gravity @xcite because that approach is deeply rooted in quantum geometry . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will use the hamiltonian framework developed here to pass to the quantum theory .",
    "one finds that the non - minimal coupling does introduce conceptual changes in the quantum geometry framework but one is again naturally led to a coherent description of quantum geometry .",
    "the seamless matching between the isolated horizon boundary conditions , the bulk quantum geometry and the surface chern - simons theory which lies at the heart of the calculation of @xcite continues but the statistical mechanical calculation now leads to the expression ( [ s ] ) of entropy .",
    "we would like to thank bob wald for suggesting that non - minimal couplings offer an interesting test for the black hole entropy calculations in loop quantum gravity , and eanna flanagan and rob myers for discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by the nsf grants phy-0090091 , conacyt grant j32754-e and dgapa - unam grant 112401 , the eberly research funds of penn state , and the schrdinger institute in vienna .",
