    "the charge carriers in graphene at half filling are effectively described by massless dirac fermions constrained to move on a two - dimensional ( 2d ) manifold embedded in three - dimensional ( 3d ) space @xcite , with a fermi velocity @xmath0 that is approximately 300 times smaller than the speed of light . as a consequence , already without taking into account the interactions , the system displays highly unusual features as compared to standard 2d electron gases , such as an anomalous integer quantum hall effect and the insensitivity to disordered - induced localization ; most of these effects have already been experimentally observed @xcite .",
    "the study of many - body interactions among the charge carriers in graphene is of course very important , particularly in view of recent experiments that suggest their relevant role in several physical properties of graphene @xcite .",
    "the effect of a weak _ short _ range interaction in graphene is quite well understood : it turns out that the behavior of the ground state is qualitatively similar to the free one , except that the fermi velocity and the wave function renormalization are renormalized by a finite amount .",
    "this was expected on the basis of a power counting analysis @xcite ; recently , it has been rigorously proven in @xcite , where the _ convergence _ of the perturbative series was established , by using the methods of constructive quantum field theory ( qft ) and by taking into full account the lattice effects ( i.e. , by considering the hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice ) .",
    "the situation in the presence of _ long _ range interactions is much more subtle and still not completely understood . their effect in graphene",
    "is usually studied in terms of a model of dirac fermions interacting via a _",
    "static _ coulomb potential ; retardation effects of the electromagnetic ( e.m . )",
    "field are neglected because the free fermi velocity @xmath0 is 300 times smaller than the speed of light @xmath1 . at weak coupling , a _ logarithmic divergence _ of the effective fermi velocity @xmath2 at the fermi points @xmath3 and a finite quasi - particles weight have been predicted , on the basis of one - loop @xcite and two - loops @xcite computations .",
    "an unbounded growth of the effective fermi velocity was also confirmed by an analysis based on a large-@xmath4 expansion @xcite , which predicted a _ power law _ divergence of @xmath2 at @xmath3 .",
    "it is not clear how to reconcile the logarithmic divergence expected from two - loops perturbative computations with the power law behavior found by large-@xmath4 expansions ; moreover , the description in terms of dirac fermions introduces spurious ultraviolet divergences that can produce ambiguities in the physical predictions @xcite .",
    "these difficulties may be related to a basic inadequacy of the effective model of dirac fermions with static coulomb interactions : the fact that the effective fermi velocity diverges at the fermi points ( as predicted by all the analyses of the model ) signals that its physical validity _ breaks down _ at the infrared scale where @xmath2 becomes comparable with the speed of light ; at lower scales , retardation effects must be taken into account , as first proposed in @xcite , where a model of massless dirac fermions propagating with speed @xmath5 and interacting with an e.m .",
    "field was considered . in @xcite",
    "it was found that , at small momenta , the wave function renormalization diverges as a power law ; this implies that the ground state correlations have an anomalous decay at large distances .",
    "moreover , it was found that the interacting fermi velocity increases up to the speed of light , again with an anomalous power law behavior . despite its interest ,",
    "the model proposed in @xcite has not been considered further .",
    "the results in @xcite were found on the basis of one - loop computations and in the presence of an ultraviolet dimensional regularization scheme .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether the predictions of @xcite remain valid even if higher orders corrections are taken into account and in the presence of different regularization schemes closer to the lattice cut - off that is truly present in actual graphene .",
    "the model we consider describes massless dirac fermions in @xmath6 dimensions propagating with velocity @xmath7 , and interacting with a @xmath8 dimensional photon field in the feynman gauge .",
    "we will not be concerned with the instantaneous case ( @xmath9 ) ; therefore , from now on , for notational simplicity , we shall fix units such that @xmath10 .",
    "the model is very similar to the one in @xcite , the main difference being the choice of the ultraviolet cut - off : rather than considering dimensional regularization , in order to mimic the presence of an underlying lattice , we explicitly introduce a ( fixed ) ultraviolet momentum cutoff both in the electronic and photonic propagators .",
    "the correlations can be computed in terms of derivatives of the following euclidean functional integral : e^(j , ) = p(d)p(da)e^v(a , ) + b(j , ) with , setting @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( repeated indexes are summed ; greek and latin labels run respectively from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , @xmath15 to @xmath14 ) , & & v(a,):= _  d + & & b(j,):= _  d , where @xmath16 is a three dimensional box of volume @xmath17 with periodic boundary conditions ( playing the role of an infrared cutoff , to be eventually removed ) , the couplings @xmath18 , @xmath19 are real and @xmath20 ; the couplings @xmath21 are _ counterterms _ to be fixed so that the photon mass is vanishing in the deep infrared .",
    "moreover , @xmath22 , @xmath23 are @xmath24-components _ grassmann spinors _ , and the @xmath25-th component @xmath26 of the current is defined as : j_0 , = i__0_,j _ = i v _ _ , where @xmath27 are euclidean gamma matrices , satisfying the anticommutation relations @xmath28 .",
    "the symbol @xmath29 denotes a grassmann integration with propagator g^(0 ) ( ) : = e^i _ 0 ( ) . where @xmath30 is a shorthand for @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and @xmath33 plays the role of a prefixed ultraviolet cutoff ( here @xmath34 is a non increasing @xmath35 function from @xmath36 to @xmath37 $ ] such that @xmath38",
    "if @xmath39 and @xmath40 if @xmath41 ) . finally , @xmath42 are gaussian variables and @xmath43 is a gaussian integration with propagator w^(0 ) ( ) : = e^i = e^i .[1.5 ] we perform an analysis based on the methods of _ constructive renormalization group _ ( rg ) for non relativistic fermions , introduced in @xcite ( see @xcite for updated introductions ) , which have already been proved effective in the study of several low - dimensional critical systems , such as one - dimensional ( 1d ) interacting fermions @xcite , 2d critical ising and vertex models @xcite , the 2d hubbard model on the square lattice at positive temperatures @xcite , interacting fermions with asymmetric fermi surfaces @xcite and the 2d hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice @xcite , just to mention a few . compared to other rg approaches , such as those in @xcite , the advantage of the constructive methods we adopt is that they allow us to get a rigorous and complete treatment of the effects of the cut - offs and a full control on the perturbative expansion via explicit bounds at all orders ; quite remarkably , in certain cases , such as the ones treated in @xcite , these methods even provide a way to prove the _ convergence _ of the resummed perturbation theory .    by using these methods ,",
    "we construct a renormalized expansion , allowing us to express the schwinger functions , from which the physical observables can be computed , as series in the effective couplings ( the effective charges and the effective photon masses , also called in the following the _ running coupling constants _ ) , with _",
    "finite _ coefficients at all orders , admitting explicit @xmath44 bounds ( see theorem [ thm1 ] in section [ sec3 ] below ) .",
    "if the effective couplings remain small in the infrared , informations obtained from our expansion by lowest order truncations are reliable at weak coupling .",
    "the importance of having an expansion with finite coefficients should not be underestimated ; the naive perturbative expansion in the fine structure constant is plagued by _",
    "logarithmic infrared divergences _ and higher orders are more and more divergent .",
    "of course the renormalized expansion is useful only as long as the running coupling constants are small .",
    "in fact , we do prove that they remain small for all infrared scales , by implementing ward identities ( wis ) in the rg flow , using a technique developed in @xcite for the rigorous analysis of luttinger liquids in situations where bosonization can not be applied ( e.g. , in the presence of an underlying lattice and/or of non - linear bands ) .",
    "the wis that we use are based on an approximate local gauge invariance , the exact gauge symmetry being broken by the ultraviolet cut - off ; its presence produces corrections to the `` naive '' ( formal ) wis , which can be resummed and , again , explicitly bounded at all orders .",
    "the resulting modified wis imply that the effective charges tend to a line of fixed points , exactly as in 1d luttinger liquids .",
    "we note that this is one of the very few examples in which luttinger liquid behavior is found in dimensions higher than @xmath15 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath45 the expectation value with respect to the interaction ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the infinite volume limit ; our main result can be informally stated as follows ( more rigorous statements will be found below ) .",
    ".5 cm * main result .",
    "* _ there exists a choice of @xmath21 such that , for @xmath46 small , = ( 1+b ( ) ) , where : z ( ) ~||^- , v_eff - v ( ) ~(v_eff - v ) ||^ , @xmath47 are expressed by series in the effective couplings with finite coefficients that admit @xmath44-bounds at all orders .",
    "moreover : ( i ) the first non - trivial contribution to @xmath48 is of second order in @xmath18 ; ( ii ) the first non - trivial contribution to @xmath21 is of second order in @xmath18 and positive ; ( iii ) the first non - trivial contributions to @xmath49 are , respectively : ^(2)=,^(2)=,v_eff^(2)=1-f(v),[second]with f(v)= , _ 0:=.[1.88 ] _ .4 cm note that the theory is not lorentz invariant , because @xmath50 ; moreover , gauge symmetry is broken by the presence of the ultraviolet momentum cut - off .",
    "these two facts produce unusual features as compared to standard qft models . in particular , the momentum cut - off produces correction terms in the wis , which can be rigorously bounded at all orders ; despite these corrections , one can still use the wis to prove that the beta function for the effective charges is asymptotically vanishing at all orders , so that the model admits a line of ( non - trivial ) fixed points .",
    "the lack of gauge invariance due to the ultraviolet momentum cut - off makes it necessary ( as in @xcite ) to introduce positive counterterms to keep the photon mass equal to zero .",
    "similarly , it implies that the effective couplings with the temporal and spatial components of the gauge field are different and that the effective fermi velocity @xmath51 is not equal to the speed of light .",
    "however , it is possible to introduce in the bare interaction two different charges , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , describing the couplings of the photon field with the temporal and spatial components of the current , which can be tuned so that the dressed charges are equal and @xmath54 .    a more realistic model for single layer graphene",
    "could be obtained by considering tight binding electrons hopping on the honeycomb lattice , whose lattice currents are coupled to a 3d photon field . a renormalization group analysis similar to the one in the present paper",
    "could be repeated for the lattice model , by extending the formalism in @xcite .",
    "if the lattice model is chosen in such a way that lattice gauge invariance is preserved , we expect that its photon mass counterterms are exactly zero and that its effective fermi velocity is equal to the speed of light . in any case ( i.e. , both in the presence or in the absence of lattice gauge invariance ) , we expect the lattice model to have the same infrared asymptotic behavior of the continuum model considered here , provided that the bare parameters @xmath55 of the continuum model are properly tuned",
    ".    finally , let us comment about the possibility of providing a full _ non perturbative _ construction of the ground state of the present model or , possibly , of a more realistic model of tight binding electrons hopping on the honeycomb lattice and interacting with e.m .",
    "forces . in this paper , we express the physical obervables in terms of series in the running coupling constants ( with bounded coefficients at all orders ) and we show that the running coupling constants remain close to their initial value , thanks to ward identities and cancellations in the beta function .",
    "thus , the usual problem that so far prevented the non - perturbative construction of the ground state of systems of interacting fermions in @xmath56 with convex symmetric fermi surface ( namely , the presence of a beta function driving the infrared flow for the effective couplings out of the weak coupling regime ) is absent in the present case .",
    "therefore , a full non - perturbative construction of the ground state of the present model appears to be feasible , by using determinant bounds for the fermionic sector and cluster expansion techniques for the bosonic sector .",
    "of course , the construction is expected to be much more difficult than the one in @xcite or @xcite , due to the simultaneous presence of bosons and fermions ; if one succeeded in providing it , it would represent the first rigorous example of anomalous luttinger - liquid behavior in more than one dimension .    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec3 ] we describe how to evaluate the functional integrals defining the partition function and the correlations of our model in terms of an exact rg scheme ( details are discussed in appendix [ appsim ] and [ app3 ] ) ; in section [ sec3a ] we describe the infrared flow of the effective couplings and prove the emergence of an effective fermi velocity different from the speed of light ( the explicit lowest order computations of the beta function are presented in appendix [ app2 ] ) ; in section [ sec5 ] we derive the ward identity allowing us to control the flow of the effective charges ( details are discussed in appendix [ app4 ] ) and proving that the beta function for the charges is asymptotically vanishing ; finally , in section [ sec6 ] we draw the conclusions .",
    "in this section we show how to evaluate the functional integral ( [ 1.1 ] ) ; the integration will be performed in an iterative way , starting from the momenta `` close '' to the ultraviolet cutoff moving towards smaller momentum scales . at the @xmath57-th step of the iteration the functional integral ( [ 1.1 ] )",
    "is rewritten as an integral involving only the momenta smaller than a certain value , proportional to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the same constant ( to be chosen sufficiently close to @xmath15 ) appearing in the definition of the cut - off function ( see lines after ( [ 1.4 ] ) ) , and both the propagators and the interaction will be replaced by `` effective '' ones ; they differ from their `` bare '' counterparts because the physical parameters appearing in their definitions ( the fermi velocity @xmath0 , the charge @xmath18 , and the `` photon mass '' @xmath21 ) are _ renormalized _ by the integration of the momenta on higher scales . in the following , it will be convenient to introduce the _ scale label _ @xmath60 as @xmath61 .",
    "setting @xmath62 , we start from the following identity : _",

    "we believe that a renormalization group analysis , similar to the one we performed here , is possible also for the lattice model , by combining the techniques and results of @xcite with those of the present paper ; we expect that the lattice model is asymptotic to the continuum one considered here , provided that the bare parameters of the continuum model are properly tuned .",
    "another important open problem is to understand the behavior of the system in the case of static coulomb interactions ; this case can be obtained by taking the limit @xmath9 together with a proper rescaling of the electronic charge in the model with retarded interactions .",
    "however , as discussed in the remark at the end of section [ bound ] , the static case seems to be much more subtle than the one considered in this paper , since it apparently requires cancellations even to prove renormalizability of the theory at all orders .",
