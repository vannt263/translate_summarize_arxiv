    "within quantum chromodynamics , hadrons are described in terms of quarks , anti - quarks and gluons .",
    "the usual , well - known , mesons are supposed to contain quarks and anti - quarks as valence degrees of freedom while gluons play the role of carrier of interaction , _",
    "i.e. _ they remain hidden in a background . on the other hand",
    ", qcd does not prohibit the existence of the explicit gluonic degree of freedom in the form of a vibrating flux tube , for instance .",
    "the states where the @xmath3 and @xmath4 configurations are dominating , hybrids and glueballs , are of fundamental importance to understand the dynamics of quark confinement and the nonperturbative sector of quantum chromodynamics @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the study of these hadrons outside the constituent quark models , namely exotic hybrids , is the main reason of the present paper .",
    "we investigate how hybrid mesons with @xmath0 may be studied through the so - called hard reactions .",
    "we focus on deep exclusive meson electroproduction ( see , for instance @xcite ) which is well described in the framework of the collinear approximation where generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) @xcite and distribution amplitudes @xcite describe the nonperturbative parts of a factorized amplitude @xcite .",
    "we propose to study the exotic hybrid meson by means of its deep exclusive electroproduction , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 where we will concentrate on the subprocess : @xmath6 when the baryon is scattered at small angle .",
    "this process is a hard exclusive reaction due to the transferred momentum @xmath7 is large ( bjorken regime ) . within this regime ,",
    "a factorization theorem is valid , at the leading twist level , which claims that a partonic subprocess part described in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) can be detached from universal soft parts , which are generalized parton distributions and meson distribution amplitudes . below we will analyze in more details how this factorization theorem applies to the process under study .",
    "let us fix the kinematics of the deep electroproduction process .",
    "we are interested in the scaling regime where the virtuality of the photon @xmath8 is large and scales with the energy of the process .",
    "we denote by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the momentum of the incoming ( outgoing ) nucleon , while @xmath11 is the momentum of the longitudinally polarized hybrid meson of mass @xmath12 .",
    "we construct the average momentum @xmath13 and transferred momentum @xmath14 : @xmath15 with two light - cone vectors : @xmath16 , the sudakov decompositions for all the relevant momenta take the form : @xmath17 here , the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 are related by @xmath20 the leading order amplitude for the process ( [ pr ] ) is @xmath21 { \\cal v}^{(h,\\,-)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath22 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\biggl [ \\frac{1}{x+\\xi - i\\epsilon}\\pm\\frac{1}{x-\\xi+i\\epsilon}\\biggr ] , \\quad % \\nonumber\\\\ % \\label{softin2 } { \\cal v}^{(m,\\,\\pm)}= \\int\\limits_{0}^{1 } dy \\phi^{m}(y)\\biggl [ \\frac{1}{y}\\pm\\frac{1}{1-y } \\biggr].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 are standard leading twist gpd s and their properties are fairly well - known . in ( [ softin1 ] ) , we include the definition of @xmath25 and @xmath26 which will be useful for the comparison with the @xmath27 meson case .",
    "the hybrid meson distribution amplitude is a new object and we will carefully study it in the next subsection .",
    "we will now consider the properties of the hybrid meson distribution amplitude ( see also @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "the fourier transform of the hybrid meson to  vacuum matrix element of the bilocal vector quark operator may be written as @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath23 denotes the isovector triplet of hybrid mesons ; @xmath31 denotes a dimensionful coupling constant of the hybrid meson , so that @xmath32 is dimensionless .    in ( [ hmew ] )",
    ", we imply the path - ordered gluonic exponential along the straight line connecting the initial and final points @xmath33 $ ] which provides the gauge invariance for bilocal operator and equals unity in a light - like ( axial ) gauge . for simplicity of notation",
    "we shall omit the index @xmath34 from the hybrid meson distribution amplitude .",
    "although exotic quantum numbers like @xmath35 are forbidden in the quark model , it does not prevent the leading twist correlation function from being non zero .",
    "the basis of the argument is that the non - locality of the quark correlator opens the possibility of getting such a hybrid state , because of dynamical gluonic degrees of freedom arising from the wilson line ( more details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the unpolarized cross section corresponding to the reaction ( [ pr2 ] ) is defined by @xmath36 where the amplitude @xmath37 is determined by ( [ amp02 ] ) ; @xmath38 , @xmath39 are the usual mandelstam variables and @xmath40 is the nucleon mass",
    ". the function @xmath41 is standardly defined by @xmath42 to calculate the cross section ( [ xsecl ] ) , we need to model the corresponding gpd s .",
    "we apply the radyushkin model @xcite where the function @xmath23 , see ( [ amp02 ] ) , is expressed with the help of double distributions @xmath43 .",
    "@xmath44{fig1-proc.ps}}\\ ] ]    to get prediction for the cross sections we need to fix the renormalization scales .",
    "in order to estimate theoretical uncertainties of this procedure we fix the scale @xmath45 in two different ways : firstly , in the naive way , by assuming @xmath46 , and secondly , by applying the blm prescription @xcite .",
    "the blm procedure , which is discussed in details in @xcite , leads to the following values of the renormalization scales : @xmath47 for the case @xmath48 ( or @xmath49 ) .",
    "these renormalization scales have rather small magnitudes .",
    "this has a tendency to enlarge the cross sections but may endanger the validity of the perturbative approach .",
    "however , it is possible that the coupling constant @xmath50 stays below unity and the perturbative theory does not suffer from the ir divergencies .",
    "we will use the shirkov and solovtsov s ansatz @xcite where the analytic running coupling constant takes the form : @xmath51.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath52 is the standard scale parameter in qcd . the second term in ( [ asan ] )",
    "assures the absence of a ghost pole at @xmath53 and has a nonperturbative source .",
    "detailed discussion on this point may be found in @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , in @xcite the role of power corrections due to the intrinsic transverse momentum of partons ( the kinematical higher twist ) has been investigated . in that approach the inclusion of the intrinsic transverse momentum dependence results in a rather strong effect on the differential cross - section before the scaling regime",
    "is achieved . in @xcite ,",
    "the renormalization scale @xmath54 is defined by the gluon virtuality so that the scale is a function of parton fractions flowing into the corresponding gluon propagator . on fig .",
    "[ xsec2 ] , we present our results for the differential cross section of the hybrid meson electroproduction compared to the @xmath27 meson electroproduction , using the blm scales .",
    "we can see that the hybrid cross section is rather sizeable in comparison with the corresponding @xmath27 meson cross section .",
    "one can see that in the region @xmath55 the size of the @xmath27 meson cross section obtained with the inclusion of transverse momentum effects is very close to the analogous cross section computed with the blm scale and without the intrinsic transverse momentum dependence . on the other hand , for higher values of @xmath7 the leading order amplitude computed with",
    "the blm scale fixing is falling faster that the corresponding amplitude derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , whereas for smaller values of @xmath7 it is larger than that prediction .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated the leading twist contribution to exotic hybrid meson with @xmath0 electroproduction amplitude in the deep exclusive region .",
    "the resulting order of magnitude is somewhat smaller than the @xmath27 electroproduction but similar to the @xmath56 electroproduction .",
    "the obtained cross section is sizeable and should be measurable at dedicated experiments at jlab , hermes or compass .",
    "we made a systematic comparison with the non - exotic vector meson production . to take into account nlo corrections , the differential cross - sections for these processes",
    "have been computed using the blm prescription for the renormalization scale . in the case of @xmath27 production ,",
    "our estimate is not far from a previous one which took into account kinematical higher twist corrections . in the region of small @xmath7 higher twist contributions",
    "should be carefully studied and included .",
    "note that they have already been considered in the case of deeply virtual compton scattering @xcite where their presence was dictated by gauge invariance , and for transversely polarized vector mesons @xcite where the leading twist component vanishes .",
    "we leave this study for future works .",
