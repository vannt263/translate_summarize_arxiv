    "a substantial effort has been dedicated to construct the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for sizeable samples of quasars over the whole accessible range of the electromagnetic spectrum ( see e.g.  sanders et al .",
    "1989 ; francis et al .  1991",
    "; elvis et al .  1994 ; richards et al .  2006 ) .",
    "however , only a few papers focus on the comparison between the seds of radio loud ( rlq ) and radio quiet ( rqq ) quasars .",
    "elvis et al .",
    "1994 propose an overall spectrum from a sample of 47 quasars , divided in rlqs and rqqs , which shows that no distinction between the seds of the two subsamples is apparent in the range @xmath5 .",
    "as noted by these authors , the considered sample is biased towards x - ray and optically bright quasars .",
    "some indication of a possible difference between the nir to optical colors of rlqs and rqqs in the 2mass catalogue was reported by barkhouse & hall ( 2001 ) .",
    "francis , whiting & webster ( 2000 ) found that the optical ",
    "nir continuum is significantly redder in radio selected rlqs from the pks half - jansky flat - spectrum survey than in optically selected rqqs from the large bright quasar survey ( lbqs ) .",
    "these and other works ( e.g.  kotilainen et al .",
    "2007 ) indicate that radio loud objects are possibly redder than their radio quiet counterparts , but the samples seriously suffer of selection effects against red radio quiet quasar , because rqqs are mostly collected from optical selected samples ( e.g.  the lbqs , the first selection criterion of which is `` blue color '' of candidates ; see hooper , impey & foltz 1997 ) .",
    "white et al . suggest that redder quasars from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) are likely to be more radio - powerful than bluer objects , and this is an indication that the red color of radio loud objects is not completely due to the bias against red rqqs in optically selected samples , since the two classes of objects derive from the same survey .    because of the importance of the distinction between rlqs and rqqs in the unified models of agn , these results suggest and motivate a study aimed at investigating the properties of the continuum emission of quasars in the uv to nir region , in order to compare and contrast the seds of radio loud and radio quiet objects . in section [ secsample ]",
    "we focus on the quasar sample selection criteria and on the host galaxy contribution . in section [ sed ]",
    "we consider the sed construction and discuss the spectral shape .",
    "the rlq and rqq seds are then compared and contrasted . in the last section we provide a summary and a discussion of the results .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a concordant cosmology with @xmath6  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "in order to mark similarities and differences of the continuum spectroscopic properties of rlqs and rqqs , our first aim is the selection of a quasar sample which is minimally biassed against the radio properties and the nuclear color of the objects .",
    "we start our analysis from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalogue iii ( schneider et al .",
    "2005 ) ; we then require that objects are in the observation area of the faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ( first , becker et al .",
    "2003 ) , which is the reference catalogue for radio data , in order to allow the distinction between rlqs and rqqs . finally , this sample is cross - correlated with the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass , cutri et al .",
    "2003 ) in order to have detections in the near - infrared ( nir ) bands .",
    "the sdss quasar catalogue ( 46420 objects ) covers about 4188 deg@xmath10 and selects objects that have luminosities larger than @xmath11 , have at least one emission line with fwhm larger than 1000 km@xmath12s or are unambiguously broad absorption line objects , are fainter than @xmath13 and have highly reliable redshifts .",
    "note that the sdss quasar catalogue suffers from a small bias in favour of radio loud objects , as a first detection is one of the starting criteria to select quasar candidates ; anyway white et al .",
    "( 2007 ) verified that this introduces at most a very minor bias towards higher radio - optical ratios .",
    "starting from the sdss quasars , we focus on those which are in the first observation area , but we do nt exclude _ a priori _ the objects which are under the first flux limit ( 1 mjy ) , so that no bias against the radio power is introduced . the distinction between radio loud and radio quiet objects is usually made referring to the ratio between the radio and optical flux . here",
    "we assume that a qso is radio loud if : @xmath14 and radio quiet otherwise ) should be applied to rest - frame data , but this correction requires the assumption of a spectral shape of the objects .",
    "here we choose to evaluate this ratio based on observed data ; we verified that the difference is completely negligible . ]",
    "( e.g. kellermann et al .",
    "note that our division between rlqs and rqqs should not be considered a physical bimodality , an issue on which there is still controversy in the literature ( e.g.  goldschmidt et al .",
    "1999 ; ivezi et al .",
    "2002 ; jiang at al .  2007 ) . yet",
    "our division is a simple separation in two groups of high or low radio power with respect to a certain limit .",
    "we verified that all the results presented here remain substantially unchanged adopting different limits ( 5 or 30 ) for the distinction between rl and rq objects .",
    "there are not radio data for all the objects in the sample ( 91% of the objects are below the first radio flux limit ) , and obviously the larger part of these are expected to be radio quiet objects . in order not to introduce a bias against the ratio of rlqs and rqqs , we select all the objects which have @xmath15 , so that for this subsample we can discriminate between rlqs and rqqs .",
    "in fact , if an object has a radio flux under the first limit ( i.e. @xmath16mjy ) and @xmath15 ( i.e. @xmath17mjy ) , because of condition ( [ lq ] ) it is a rqq , while we could not discriminate if @xmath18 .",
    "this restriction reduces the sample by 66% , keeping the original ratio between the number of rqqs and rlqs .",
    "we obtain a sample of 14395 objects , 1105 of which are rlqs and 13290 are rqqs . from the sloan data , we derived the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 magnitudes .",
    "the values were corrected for galactic extinction , following the indications given in schneider et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "the sloan ",
    "first sample was then cross - correlated with the 2mass catalogue , in order to obtain the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 magnitudes of the objects .",
    "the 2mass survey is a collection of near - infrared uniformly - calibrated observations of the entire sky ; sources brighter than about 1 mjy in each band were detected with a signal - to - noise ratio greater than 10 .",
    "the cross - correlation strongly reduces the sample , which now consists of 1761 common objects with observations in 8 bands each .",
    "we assumed two objects are matched if their separation angle is less than 0.2 arcsec , which roughly corresponds to the position error of the catalogues .",
    "obviously the request of a 2mass detection introduces a bias in the sample , as among high redshift ( low luminosity ) objects the redder ones are more likely detected . in the following",
    "we will come back on this issue .",
    "a host galaxy component could affect the luminosity measures in part of the selected quasars .",
    "we require that the selected objects to have a negligible galaxy component with respect to the nuclear flux .",
    "assuming that all the galaxies are ellipticals ( sed from mannucci et al .",
    "2001 ) , purely passively evolving ( bressan , chiosi & fagotto  1994 ) , with @xmath27 for rlqs and @xmath28 for rqqs at @xmath29 ( see for example kotilainen et al .",
    "2006 ) , we give a first order estimate of the galaxy component flux in the 8 sloan & 2mass filters .",
    "an object is excluded from the sample if the estimated flux of the host galaxy is greater than 20% of the observed flux .",
    "the excluded objects ( @xmath30 ) are mostly weak , nearby ( @xmath31 ) quasars . we also tested if the removal of quasars with substantial host galaxies could be done by looking at the difference between psf and model magnitudes in sdss .",
    "the results reported in the following remain substantially unchanged .",
    "+      the final sample ( see table [ elec2 ] , available in complete form electronically ) consists of 887 qsos , of which 774 rqqs and 113 rlqs .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]         since we are interested in the study of the shape of the sed with reference to the radio power , independently of any other parameter , we now construct a number of rqq samples matched in absolute magnitude to the rlqs is extracted from the rqq population with probability proportional to the luminosity density of the rlqs . ] .",
    "we verify that the rqq matched samples automatically result well matched to the rlqs also in redshift .",
    "table [ pertantiz ] reports the average results of 10 random matched samples .",
    "the seds of the rqq matched samples are on average slightly softer than those of the entire rqq population ( @xmath32 ) , however the kolmogorov - smirnov test indicates that the probability of rlqs and all the rqq matched samples to be drawn from the same underlying population is still negligible ( @xmath33 ; the value is greater than before as the sample has been drastically reduced ) , and the difference of the mean spectral indices is again @xmath34 .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the whole rqq population and an rqq matched sample have identical distributions in @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) and it is a strong indication that the radio loud and radio quiet populations are intrinsically different , in the sense that radio loud objects are systematically redder than radio quiet quasars independently of the average luminosity or cosmic time .",
    "finally we compare rlqs and rqqs in different redshift bins ( see again table [ pertantiz ] ) , and this test shows that the color difference between the rl and rq populations is apparent in all the redshift ranges .",
    "the aim of the present paper is the study of the continuum emission in the nir to uv region of a quasar sample , in order to compare and contrast the seds of the rlq and rqq subsamples .",
    "we selected a sample of quasars with both sloan and 2mass detection , to study a spectral range from the nir ( for low-@xmath23 objects ) to the uv ( for high-@xmath23 qsos ) .",
    "the sample consists of 887 objects , of which 113 rlqs and 774 rqqs .    for each subsample we constructed the mean sed and evaluated the average spectral index in the nir to uv region .",
    "the slope of the underlying power - laws is significantly different : the spectral indices of the two population are statistically different at more than 99% confidence , both for the whole sample and dividing the sample in redshift bins .",
    "the difference is present also considering samples well matched in absolute magnitude and redshift .",
    "if the blue bump is due to the superposition of black body emissions from an accretion disc , then the color difference between rlqs and rqqs should be interpreted in terms of different mean temperatures , in the sense that rqqs are hotter .",
    "mag , solid line ) , no difference is apparent.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we first examine the possibility that the difference in the seds of rlqs and rqqs is due to an enhanced dust extinction in radio loud objects , as it has been suggested e.g.  by francis et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . in fig .",
    "[ dust ] we compare the sed of rqqs to the sed of rlqs , when rlqs are additionally corrected for dust extinction with respect to rqqs : the offset between the seds of the two population is minimized adopting @xmath37mag .",
    "the differences are now completely negligible , supporting the hypothesis that rl objects are more subject to dust extinction than rqqs . the problem would be reconducted to understand why rlqs are more extincted than rqqs . _",
    "a priori _ this could be related to a difference in the inclination angle distribution .",
    "alternatively , it could be that the conditions of dust production are related to those justifying large radio emission .",
    "we then focus on the possibility that the difference of disc temperature of rlqs and rqqs is real . since the temperature of the inner disc scales as @xmath38 ( e.g.  shakura & sunyaev 1973 )",
    ", the difference may be attributed to the fact that the black holes of radio loud quasars are supposedly more massive ( e.g.  dunlop et al .",
    "2003 ; falomo et al .  2004 ; labita et al .",
    "the color difference may be linked to the bh spin ( stawarz , sikora & lasota 2007 ) , as radio emission is usually ascribed to a faster spinning . however ,",
    "spinning bhs are expected to have a shorter last stable orbit radius , and then a hotter disc , inconsistently with our results .",
    "obviously it is possible that the non  thermal ( power law ) continua of rlqs and rqqs are intrinsically different .",
    "supposing that the non  thermal component accounts for 80% at @xmath3hz , while at @xmath4hz ( in the big blue bump ) the thermal component is dominant and accounts for 80% , our data are consistent with a picture where the underlying power  laws of rlqs and rqqs have @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , whereas the thermal bumps are indistinguishable .",
    "the problem would be reconducted to understand why the non  thermal continuum of rlqs is softer than rqqs .",
    "it has been suggested ( i.e.  francis et al .",
    "2000 ) that in radio loud samples there is a significant chance of synchrotron contamination of the rest - frame r  band nuclear luminosities , due to the presence of the relativistic jets .",
    "this effect explains the red color of qsos in high - frequency selected radio samples ( i.e. the pks survey , e.g.  francis et al .",
    "2001 ) , that suffer from a bias towards pole - on radio sources which are relativistically boosted above the survey flux limit , but no obvious explanation can be invoked to justify the color difference in our sample .",
