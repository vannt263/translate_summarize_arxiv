    "a classical question concerns the effect that the existence of such a fixed point has on the global dynamics of @xmath5 .",

    "the _ global stable set _",
    "@xmath7 of @xmath8 is @xmath9    in general @xmath7 can be extremely complicated , both in its intrinsic geometry @xcite and/or in the way it is embedded in @xmath0 @xcite it is useful therefore to begin with a study of that part of @xmath10 which remain in a fixed neighbourhood of @xmath6 for all forward iterations . for @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    "let @xmath13 and @xmath14    for @xmath11 , define the _ local stable set _ of @xmath8 by @xmath15    in several situation it is possible to obtain a fairly comprehensive description of the geometrical and dynamical properties of the local stable manifold . in this paper",
    "we shall focus on the simplest setting of a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "we recall that the fixed point @xmath6 is hyperbolic if the derivative @xmath16 has no eigenvalues on the unit circle .",
    "let @xmath17 be a @xmath3 diffeomorphism of a riemannian surface and suppose that @xmath6 is a hyperbolic fixed point with eigenvalues @xmath18 .",
    "then there exists a constant @xmath11 such that the following properties hold :    1 .",
    "@xmath19 is @xmath20 one - dimensional submanifold of m tangent to @xmath21 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath22 on either side of @xmath6 ; 3 .",
    "@xmath19 contracts at an exponential rate .",
    "4 .   @xmath23    perhaps the key statement here is that the local stable set is actually a smooth submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "notice that the global stable set can be written as a union of preimages of @xmath24 since any point whose orbit converges to @xmath6 must eventually remain in a neighbourhood of @xmath25 and therefore must eventually belong to @xmath24 .",
    "thus we write @xmath26 the smoothness of @xmath27 then implies that @xmath28 is also a smooth submanifold of @xmath0 .",
    "we remark that while the local stable manifold is an _ embedded _",
    "submanifold , i.e. a manifold in its own right in the induced topology , the global stable manifold is in general only an _ immersed _ submanifold , i.e. a manifold in its intrinsic topology but not in the topology induced by the topology on @xmath0 .",
    "this is because it may accumulate on itself and thus fail to be locally connected in the induced topology .",
    "the proof is based on the key notions of _ hyperbolic coordinates _ and _ finite time local stable manifolds_. these are not standard concepts and therefore we describe them briefly here , leaving the details to the main body of the paper .",
    "the standard definition of hyperbolicity involves a decomposition of the tangent space into invariant subspaces , which coincide with the real _ eigenspaces _ in the case of a fixed point .",
    "however this decomposition is specifically related to the _ asymptotic _ properties of the dynamics and is not always the most useful or the most appropriate for studying the local geometry related to the dynamics for a finite number of iterations . instead",
    ", elementary linear algebra arguments show that under extremely mild hyperbolicity conditions on the linear map @xmath29 , there are well - defined _ most contracted _ directions @xmath30 which depend in a @xmath31 manner on the point @xmath32 if @xmath33 is @xmath3 . in particular , they define a foliation of _ integral curves _",
    "@xmath34 which are _ most contracted curves under _ @xmath33 .",
    "they are the natural notion of local stable manifold relative to a finite number of iterations",
    ".    in general , even for a hyperbolic fixed point , the finite time local stable manifolds will not coincide with the `` real '' asymptotic local stable manifold and will depend on the iterate @xmath35 .",
    "it is natural to expect however that the two concepts are related in the sense that finite time local stable manifolds converge to the asymptotic local stable manifold . in this paper",
    "we show that this is indeed what happens .",
    "the argument does not require previous knowledge of the existence of the asymptotic local stable manifold , and thus we obtain from the construction an alternative proof of the classical stable manifold theorem .",
    "the inspiration for this approach comes from the pioneering work of benedicks and carleson on non - uniformly hyperbolic dynamics in the context of the hnon map @xcite , the generalization of this work to hnon - like maps by mora and viana @xcite , and the further refinement of these ideas in @xcite . in these papers",
    ", a sophisticated induction argument is developed to show that a certain non - uniformly hyperbolic structure is persistent , in a measure - theoretic sense , in typical parametrized families of maps .",
    "the induction necessarily requires some knowledge of geometrical structures based only a _ finite _ number of iterations .",
    "thus the notion of contractive directions is very natural and very efficient for producing dynamical foliations which incorporate and reflect information about the first @xmath35 iterates of the map .",
    "we remark however that in the papers mentioned above , the construction of these manifolds is very much embedded in the overall argument and there is no focus on the intrinsic interest of this particular construction .",
    "moreover , the specific characteristics of the maps under consideration , such as the strong dissipativity and specific distortion bounds , are used heavily in the estimates and it is not immediately clear what precise assumptions are used in the construction .",
    "thus the main purpose of the present paper can be seen as a first step in an attempt to draw on the ideas first introduced in @xcite and to formalize them and generalize them into a fully fledged theory of invariant manifolds .",
    "we start the proof with some relatively standard hyperbolicity and distortion estimates in a neighbourhood of @xmath6 in section [ local hyperbolicity ] . in sections [ hyperbolic coordinates ] and [ finite time ]",
    "we address the first main issue which is the convergence of finite time local stable manifolds .",
    "this will be addressed by carrying out several estimates which show that angle between successive most contracted direction @xmath36 and @xmath37 depends on the hyperbolicity of @xmath38 .",
    "if some hyperbolicity conditions are satisfied for all @xmath35 , this sequence of angles forms a cauchy sequence and therefore a limit direction @xmath39 exists .",
    "we then show that we can also control the way in which contractive directions depend on the base point and eventually conclude that the sequence of most contracted leaves @xmath40 through the fixed point @xmath6 actually converge ( to something  ) . in section [ asymptotic ]",
    "we begin to show that this limit `` object '' is indeed the local stable manifold of @xmath6 by showing first of all that it has positive length .",
    "this requires a careful control of the size and geometry of the domains in which the contracting directions @xmath30 are defined , to ensure that the finite time local stable manifold @xmath41 always have some fixed length . in section [ smoothness ] we then show that this curve is sufficiently smooth . in section [",
    "s : contraction ] we show that points converge exponentially fast to @xmath6 and , finally , in section [ uniqueness ] we prove uniqueness in the sense that the curve we have constructed is the only set of points which satisfy the properties of a local stable manifold . to simplify the notation",
    "we shall suppose that both eigenvalues are positive , the other cases are all dealt with in exactly the same way .",
    "the stable manifold theorem is one of the most basic results in the geometric theory of dynamical systems and differential equations .",
    "there exists several approaches and many generalizations @xcite .",
    "we focus here on what we believe are the two main differences between our approach and existing ones .",
    "as far as we know , all existing approaches rely in one way or another on an application of the contraction mapping theorem to some suitable abstract space of _ candidate _ local stable manifolds , formulated e.g. as the graphs or sequences with certain properties .",
    "a suitable complete metric and an operator depending are then defined in such a way that a fixed point under the operator corresponds to an invariant submanifold with the required properties .",
    "the existence and uniqueness of the fixed point are then a consequence of showing that the operator is a contraction and the application of the contraction mapping theorem .",
    "our approach differs significantly from either of the approaches mentioned in at least two ways .",
    "first of all we do not use the contraction mapping theorem , not even in disguise .",
    "we show that the sequence of finite time local stable manifolds is cauchy in an appropriate topology , by relating directly the distance between succesive leaves to the hyperbolicity .",
    "this is potentially a much more flexible approach and one which may be adaptable to situations with less uniform and perhaps subexponential forms of hyperbolicity , see comments in the next section .",
    "secondly , the finite time local stable manifolds which approximate the real local stable manifold are canonically defined and have an important dynamical meaning in their own right .",
    "again , this aspect of the construction might be useful in other situation and in applications .",
    "in this paper we present the construction of the local stable manifold in the simplest setting of a hyperbolic fixed point in dimension 2 , in order to describe the ideas and the basic strategy in the clearest possible way .",
    "however we have no doubt that with some work , the basic argument will generalize in various directions . in work in progress",
    ", the authors are extending the techniques to cover the higher dimensional situation and the more general uniformly hyperbolic and projectively hyperbolic cases .",
    "the smoothness results are not yet optimal since it is known that the stable manifold is as smooth as the map , however we believe that the optimal estimates can be recovered with more sophisticated higher order distortion estimates .",
    "it is also possible to study questions related to the dependence of the local stable manifolds on the base point or on some parameter by simply including the corresponding additional derivative estimates in the calculations , as already carried out for example in the papers mentioned above in which the original ideas of the integral curves of the most contracting directions was first introduced .",
    "perhaps the most important potential of this method , however , is to situations with very weak hyperbolicity .",
    "indeed , the convergence of the finite time local stable leaves is given by the cauchy property which follows essentially from a summability condition on the derivative .",
    "thus , in principle , this may be applicable along orbits for which the derivative does not necessarily admit exponential estimates .",
    "this fact is not completely explicit in the present proof since we are dealing with very hyperbolic example , but a future paper but the same authors will provide the minimal abstract conditions under which the convergence argument works .",
    "finally we mention that there is also a vast amount of research literature concerning the explicit , often numerical , approximation of invariant manifolds .",
    "we speculate that the approach given here might be more suitable than the classical theorems as a theoretical backdrop to these numerical studies , , the finite time local stable manifolds for example can probably be calculated with significant accuracy since they depend only a finite time information on the dynamics and the derivative .",
    "our estimates then give conditions on how close these finite time manifolds are form the real thing .",
    "the first step in the proof is to use the smoothness of @xmath42 to show that some hyperbolic structure exists in a neighbourhood of the point @xmath6 .",
    "first of all we introduce some notation which we will use extensively throughout the paper . for @xmath43 and @xmath12",
    "we let @xmath44 denote the maximum expansion and the maximum contraction respectively of @xmath45",
    ". then @xmath46 denote the _ hyperbolicity _ of @xmath45 .",
    "if a sequence of neighbourhoods @xmath47 is fixed , as it will be below , we shall often use the notation @xmath48 and @xmath49 to denote the maximum values of these quantities in @xmath50 . also , when expressing relationships between these quantities which hold for all @xmath51 in @xmath52 we shall often omit explicit reference to @xmath51 .",
    "we shall also use the same convention for other functions of @xmath51 to be introduced below .",
    "we shall also use the notation @xmath53 for @xmath54 the following lemma follows from standard estimates in the theory of uniform hyperbolicity .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details and proofs .",
    "[ regular growth ] @xmath55 such that @xmath56 , @xmath57 such that for all @xmath58 and all @xmath59 we have : @xmath60 moreover , we also have that @xmath61    to simplify the notation below we shall generally use @xmath62 we will also some estimates on the higher order derivatives which follow easily from the hyperbolicity properties given above .",
    "[ distortion ] @xmath63 such that @xmath64 we have @xmath65    let @xmath66 and let @xmath67 .",
    "let @xmath68 denote differentiation of @xmath69 with respect to the space variables . by the product rule for differentiation we have @xmath70 taking norms on both sides of and using the fact that @xmath71 , @xmath72 and , by the chain rule , @xmath73 , we get @xmath74 the last inequality follows from the fact that @xmath75 is uniformly bounded above . then , by lemma [ regular growth ] we have @xmath76 this proves the first part of the statement . to prove the second , we argue along similar lines , this time letting @xmath77 .",
    "then we have , as in above , @xmath78 moreover we have that @xmath79 , @xmath80 and , by the chain rule , also @xmath81 .",
    "this gives @xmath82 by the multiplicative property of the determinant we have the equality @xmath83 therefore we get @xmath84 the first inequality follows by taking norms on both sides of , the second inequality follows from the fact that @xmath85 and @xmath86 are uniformly bounded above and below and the fact that that @xmath87 , the third inequality follows from an application of lemma [ regular growth ] .",
    "in the context of hyperbolic fixed points ( or general uniformly hyperbolic sets ) we are used to thinking of the eigenspaces ( or the subspaces given by the hyperbolic decomposition ) as providing the basic axes or coordinate system associated to the hyperbolicity .",
    "however this is not necessarily the most natural splitting of the space .",
    "indeed , the hyperbolicity condition @xmath88 ( notice that we always have @xmath89 ) implies that the linear map @xmath38 maps the unit circle @xmath90 to an ( non - circular ) ellipse @xmath91 with well defined major and minor axes .",
    "the unit vectors @xmath92 which are mapped to the minor and major axis respectively of the ellipse , and are thus the _ most contracted _ and _ most expanded _",

    "we shall adopt the notation @xmath96 where everything is of course relative to some given point @xmath51 .",
    "notice that @xmath97 and @xmath98 thus @xmath99 is a natural way of expressing the overall _ hyperbolicity _ of @xmath100 at @xmath32 .",
    "we shall use @xmath101 to denote a generic constant which is allowed to depend only on the diffeomorphism @xmath42 . for simplicity",
    "we shall allow this to change even within one inequality when this doe not create any ambiguities or confusion .",

    "the notion of most contracted and most expanded directions are central to the approach to the stable manifold theorem given here .",

    "since @xmath120 we get @xmath121 now notice that we can choose @xmath122 large enough depending only on the map , so that @xmath123 for all @xmath124 .",
    "then , for @xmath125 we have @xmath126 where we have used the boundedness of the derivative to obtain the last equality . since @xmath127 depends only on @xmath42 , we can take care of all iterates @xmath128 by simply adjusting the constant @xmath101 .",

    "local stable manifolds have not been used much in dynamics even though from a certain point of view they are even more natural than the traditional local stable manifolds .",
    "indeed , the local stable manifolds captures information about some local geometrical structure related to the asymptotic nature of the dynamics , while perhaps not containing the right kind of information regarding geometrical structures associated to some finite number of iterations of the map .",
    "as far as the dynamics for some finite number of iterates is concerned , the finite time local stable manifold @xmath41 is the natural object to look at , since it is a canonically defined submanifold which is locally _ most contracted _ under a finite number of iterations of the map .",

    "indeed , the neighbourhoods @xmath52 are in principle shrinking in size and thus the length of the leaves @xmath41 could do the same .",
    "the heart of our argument however is precisely to show that this does not happen .",
    "first we apply the pointwise convergence results of the previous section to show that the sequence of curves @xmath144 is a uniformly convergent cauchy sequence of curves and thus in particular converges pointwise to a limit curve @xmath145 . in section [ asymptotic ] we show that the arclength of the curves @xmath144 on both sides of @xmath6 is uniformly bounded below , implying that the limit curve @xmath145 has positive length .",

    "lemma [ leafcontraction ] shows that the finite time local stable manifolds are exponentially close as long as they are both of some positive length .",
