    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath6 ) transitions of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos in the earth , caused by neutrino mixing in vacuum , transition probability accounts , as is well - known , for the earth effect in the solar neutrino msw survival probability in the case of the two - neutrino @xmath6 and @xmath7 transition solutions of the solar neutrino problem , @xmath8 being a sterile neutrino . ] are enhanced by a new type of resonance which differs from the msw one and takes place when the neutrinos cross the earth core [ 1 ] .",
    "the enhancement is particularly strong in the case of small mixing [ 1 ] .",
    "the conditions for existence of the new resonance include specific constraints on the neutrino oscillation length ( and mixing angles ) in the earth mantle and core .",
    "when satisfied , these constraints ensure that certain oscillating factors in the probabilities of the @xmath0 and @xmath9 ( @xmath6 ) transitions , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , have maximal values and that this produces a resonance maximum in @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "correspondingly , the term `` neutrino oscillation length resonance '' ( nolr ) or simply `` oscillation length resonance '' was used in [ 1 ] to denote the resonance of interest .",
    "the nolr is in many respects similar , e.g. , to the resonance transforming a circularly polarized lh photon into a rh one when the photon traverses three layers of optically active medium such that the optical activity and the widths of the first and third layers are identical but differ from those of the second layer . for a more detailed discussion ) . ]",
    "the present article contains a brief review of the specific features of the oscillation length resonance in the simplest case of two - neutrino transitions of the earth core crossing solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we discuss also the implications of the nolr enhancement of these transitions [ 1,2,3,4 ] for the interpretation of the results of the super - kamiokande experiment [ 5,6 ] .",
    "according to the existing earth models [ 7 ] , the matter density and the chemical composition change mildly within the two main density structures in the earth - the mantle and the core . as a consequence , all the interesting features of the solar and atmospheric neutrino transitions in the earth , including those related to the neutrino oscillation length resonance , can be understood quantitatively assuming that the neutrinos crossing the mantle and the core traverse effectively two layers with constant but different densities , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and chemical composition or electron fraction numbers , @xmath14 and @xmath15 [ 1,3,8,9 ] .",
    "the neutrino transitions of interest in the two - layer model of the earth density distribution should be considered as mean densities along the neutrino trajectories . in the earth models [ 7 ]",
    "one has : @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for @xmath18 one can use the standard values [ 7,10 ] ( see also [ 4 ] )",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 . ]",
    "result from two - neutrino oscillations taking place i ) first in the mantle over a distance @xmath21 with a mixing angle @xmath22 and oscillation length @xmath23 , ii ) then in the core over a distance @xmath24 with different mixing angle @xmath25 and oscillation length @xmath26 , and iii ) again in the mantle over a distance @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 . because @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and due to the matter effect , we have for given neutrino energy @xmath30 , mass squared difference @xmath31 and vacuum mixing angle @xmath32 , @xmath33 ( see , e.g. , [ 11 ] ) : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 , @xmath38 being the neutrino oscillation length in vacuum . for fixed @xmath21 and @xmath24 the oscillation length resonance occurs [ 1 ] if i ) the relative phases acquired by the energy eigenstate neutrinos in the mantle and in the core , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ,",
    "are correlated , @xmath41 and if ii ) the inequalities @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 are fulfilled .",
    "conditions ( 1 ) are universal , i.e. , they are valid for @xmath10 , @xmath45 , etc . while ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) correspond only to @xmath10 [ 1 ] .",
    "when equalities ( 1 ) hold , ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) ensure that @xmath10 has a maximum . in the region of the nolr maximum , e.g. , for @xmath46 , @xmath10",
    "is given by [ 1 ] : @xmath47   \\left [ \\sin^2(2\\theta''_{m } - 4\\theta'_{m }   + \\theta ) - \\sin^2\\theta \\right ] .~\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] at the nolr maximum we have [ 1 ] ( fig .",
    "1 ) : @xmath48 the analogs of eqs . ( 2 ) - ( 4 ) for @xmath11 can be obtained by formally setting @xmath49 while keeping @xmath50 in eqs .",
    "( 2 ) - ( 4 ) : thus , ( 2a ) becomes @xmath51 and is always fulfilled , while ( 2b ) transforms into [ 1 ] @xmath52    note that since @xmath21 and @xmath24 are fixed for a given neutrino trajectory , which is specified by its nadir angle @xmath53 , the nolr conditions ( 1 ) are constraints on the oscillation lengths @xmath23 and @xmath26 . at @xmath54 one of the two requirements in ( 1 )",
    "is equivalent for @xmath55 to the physical condition [ 1 ] @xmath56 remarkably enough , for the @xmath0 and @xmath57 transitions of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos in the earth , the nolr conditions ( 1 ) with @xmath58 are approximately fulfilled at small @xmath59 in the regions where ( 2a ) - ( 2b ) or ( 5 ) hold [ 1 ] .",
    "the associated nolr maxima in @xmath10 and @xmath11 are absolute maxima and dominate in @xmath10 and @xmath11 [ 1,3 ] ( fig .",
    "2 ) : the values of the probabilities at these maxima in the case of two - neutrino mixing are considerably larger - by a factor of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) , than the values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 at the local maxima    associated with the msw effect in the earth core ( mantle ) .",
    "the magnitude of the nolr enhancement depends on the neutrino trajectory through the earth core : the enhancement is maximal for the center - crossing neutrinos [ 1,3 ] .",
    "even at small mixing angles the resonance is relatively wide both in the neutrino energy and the nadir angle [ 1,3 ] ( fig .",
    "the nolr ( relative ) energy width is given for @xmath62 approximately by @xmath63 it practically does not depend on @xmath59 and varies slowly with the change of @xmath53 : for @xmath64 one has and @xmath7 ( @xmath65 mixing ) , and in @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) at small mixing angles , see [ 1,3 ] . ] @xmath68 .",
    "let us note that the dominating maximum due to the nolr can _ now _ be recognized in certain plots of the probabilities @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 , shown in some of the articles discussing the earth effect in the transitions of solar and atmospheric neutrinos ( see , e.g. , [ 12,13 ] ) .",
    "this maximum was invariably interpreted to be due to the msw effect in the earth core and summarized above differs substantially from the studies [ 14 ] of the resonance enhancement of the @xmath2 transitions in matter varying _ periodically _ along the neutrino path ( parametric resonance ) .",
    "the density change along the path of a neutrino crossing the earth core is not periodic ( even in the two - layer model it falls short of making one and a half periods ) and the results obtained in [ 14 ] do not apply to the case of transitions of the earth core crossing neutrinos , studied in [ 1 ] . ] before the study [ 1 ] .",
    "finally , in [ 15 ] the @xmath67 transitions in the earth were considered for @xmath69 .",
    "it was noticed that in the region where @xmath70 , @xmath71 being the neutron number density , a new maximum in @xmath72 appears when @xmath73 , found to hold at @xmath74 .",
    "the height of the maximum is comparable to the heights of the other `` ordinary '' maxima present in @xmath72 for @xmath69 .",
    "it is stated in [ 15 ] that the effect does not take place in the @xmath57 transitions and the case of solar neutrinos is not discussed .",
    "the implications of the nolr enhancement of the probability @xmath10 for    the tests of the msw @xmath2 and @xmath7 solutions of the solar neutrino problem are discussed in detail in refs .",
    "[ 1,2,3,4 ] . in the case of the small mixing angle ( nonadiabatic )",
    "@xmath2 solution , the nolr produces [ 4 ] a much bigger - by a factor of @xmath75 , day - night asymmetry in the super - kamiokande sample of solar neutrino events , whose night fraction is due to the _ core - crossing _ neutrinos , in comparison with the asymmetry determined by using the _ whole night _",
    "event sample .",
    "the super - kamiokande collaboration has successfully exploited this result [ 3 ] in the analysis of their solar neutrino data in terms of the msw effect [ 5 ] .    the nolr enhancement of the @xmath57 transitions of the atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth has important implications for the interpretation of the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data as well [ 1 ] .",
    "the zenith angle dependence of the rates of sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath5like events , observed in the super - kamiokande experiment , provides a strong evidence for oscillations of the atmospheric @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) [ 6 ] .",
    "the data is best described in the case of two - neutrino mixing by @xmath78 vacuum oscillations with parameters @xmath79 and @xmath80 [ 6 ] .",
    "it is quite remarkable that for values of @xmath81 suggested by the super - kamiokande data , the nolr strongly enhances the @xmath1 ( and @xmath82 ) transitions of the atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth core , making the transitions detectable even at small mixing angles [ 1 ] . indeed , for , e.g. , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 ( earth center crossing ) , the absolute maximum in @xmath11 due to the nolr takes place at @xmath86gev .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath76 with such energies contribute either to the sub - gev or to the multi - gev @xmath3like and @xmath5like super - kamiokande event samples [ 6 ] . at small mixing angles the nolr enhancement holds practically for all neutrino trajectories through the earth core [ 1,3 ] .",
    "accordingly , it was suggested in [ 1,2 ] ( see also [ 3 ] ) that , depending on the value of @xmath88 , the small excess of e - like events in the region @xmath89 , @xmath90 being the zenith angle , either in the sub - gev or in the multi - gev sample , observed ( in both samples ) in the super - kamiokande experiment [ 6 ] , is due to @xmath1 small mixing transitions , @xmath91 , strongly enhanced by the nolr as neutrinos cross the earth core on the way to the detector .",
    "the same nolr enhanced transitions should produce at least part of the zenith angle dependence , exhibited by the super - kamiokande sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath5like data [ 2,3 ] .      where @xmath113 is the @xmath114 flux in the absence of neutrino transitions / oscillations , @xmath115 , @xmath116 being the @xmath117 element of @xmath105 , @xmath118 , and @xmath119 .",
    "the two - neutrino transition probability amplitude @xmath120 is given in the two - layer model of the earth density distribution by eq .",
    "( 1 ) in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] in which first @xmath32 is formally set to @xmath121 while @xmath122 and @xmath123 are kept arbitrary , and after that @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) and @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) are interchanged",
    ". the phase @xmath128 has the form [ 2,3,16 ] : @xmath129\\ ] ] @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the interpretation of the super - kamiokande data [ 6 ] in terms of @xmath96 oscillations requires @xmath133 , with 0.5 being the statistically preferred value . for the predicted ratio @xmath134 of the @xmath76 and @xmath87 fluxes for @xmath135 one",
    "has [ 19,20 ] : @xmath136 for the neutrinos contributing to the sub - gev event samples , and @xmath137 for those giving the main contribution to the multi - gev samples . if @xmath138 and @xmath139 we have @xmath140 and the possible effects of the @xmath1 and @xmath82 transitions on the @xmath87 flux and correspondingly on the sub - gev @xmath3like event sample , would be strongly suppressed even if these transitions are maximally enhanced by the nolr .",
    "the indicated suppression may actually be taking place .",
    "performed within the indicated three - neutrino mixing scheme reveals , in particular , that the excess of e - like events in the super - kamiokande sub - gev data at @xmath89 seems unlikely to be due to small mixing angle , @xmath106 , @xmath1 transitions amplified by the oscillation length resonance . ] note , however , that the factor @xmath141 can be as large as @xmath142 for the sub - gev neutrinos and that the effects of the nolr enhanced @xmath57 transitions in the sub - gev @xmath3like event sample can be suppressed by the specific way this sample is selected from the data in the super - kamiokande experiment [ 18 ] . for the multi - gev neutrinos we have @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "the factor @xmath141 amplifies the effect of the @xmath1 transitions in the @xmath3like sample for @xmath145 , for which @xmath146 [ 19,20 ] .",
    "this discussion suggests that the effects of the neutrino oscillation length resonance in the super - kamiokande @xmath3like multi - gev data for @xmath147 should be much larger than those in the @xmath3like sub - gev data for @xmath148 [ 2,3,18 ] . as similar analysis of the expression ( 8) for @xmath149 shows , they are also expected to be larger ( within the 3@xmath150 mixing scheme considered ) than the nolr effects in the multi - gev @xmath5like event sample [ 2,3,18 ] . in all samples , except ,",
    "perhaps , the sub - gev @xmath3like one , the nolr effects can be observable .",
    "the neutrino oscillation length resonance should be present in the @xmath151 transitions of the solar neutrinos crossing the earth core on the way to the detector , if the solar neutrino problem is due to small mixing angle msw @xmath92 transitions in the sun .",
    "the same resonance should be operative also in the @xmath1 ( @xmath82 ) small mixing angle transitions of the atmospheric neutrinos crossing the earth core if the atmospheric @xmath76 and @xmath77 indeed take part in large mixing vacuum @xmath152 oscillations with @xmath81 , as is strongly suggested by the super - kamiokande data [ 6 ] , and if all three flavour neutrinos are mixed in vacuum .",
    "actually , the resonance may have already manifested itself in the excess of e - like events at @xmath89 observed in the super - kamiokande multi - gev atmospheric neutrino data [ 1,2,3,18 ] . and it can be responsible for at least part of the strong zenith angle dependence present in the super - kamiokande multi - gev and sub - gev @xmath5like data [ 2,3,18 ] .",
