    "stellar population synthesis is a widely used technique to model the spectra and photometry evolution of galaxies .",
    "it is also an important method to estimate the stellar contents of galaxies from spectra ( e.g. , @xcite ) or photometry data ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a lot of models such as @xcite ( galaxev ) , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( pegase ) , and @xcite have been brought forward for studying stellar populations , but most of them did not take binary interactions into account . similarly , the popular models for galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) did not take binary interactions into account , either .",
    "therefore , most results of stellar population studies are derived from single star stellar population ( ss - ssp ) models , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , while only a few results from binary star stellar population ( bs - ssp ) model @xcite .",
    "a reason for those works using ss - ssps rather than bs - ssps is that the evolution of binaries is much more complicated than single stars .",
    "the calculation of binary stellar population synthesis usually takes much more time and disk space compared to single stellar population synthesis .",
    "however , as pointed out by , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , more than 50% stars are in binaries , and binary interactions are important for stellar population synthesis .",
    "many observational phenomena such as the far - uv excess of elliptical galaxies @xcite and blue stragglers in star clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ) can be explained more naturally via bs - ssps than via ss - ssps .",
    "in fact , both blue stragglers and far - uv excess of elliptical galaxies can be produced naturally by binary interactions without any special assumptions ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this suggests that it is necessary to model stellar populations of galaxies via bs - ssps .",
    "we mainly intend to build a database for stellar population synthesis studies and present a new model for quickly modeling bs - ssps .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sect .",
    "2 , we briefly introduce the evolution of stars . in sect .",
    "3 , we present the isochrone database for stellar population synthesis studies . in sect .",
    "4 , we present our new stellar population synthesis model . as an application of the isochrone database in colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) studies",
    ", we fit the cmds of two star clusters in sect .",
    "5 . finally , we give our discussions and conclusions in sect .",
    "in this work , we use the rapid stellar evolution code of @xcite , hereafter hurley code , to evolve binaries and single stars .",
    "this code enables modeling of even the most complex binary systems .",
    "binary interactions such as mass transfer , mass accretion , common - envelope evolution , collisions , supernova kicks , angular momentum loss mechanism , and tidal interactions are considered ( see @xcite for details ) . besides the code can calculate the evolution of stars quickly ,",
    "the average uncertainty caused by the code is typically smaller than 5% .",
    "to build a database for conveniently and quickly modeling stellar populations , we take wide ranges for input stellar - population parameters ( metallicity , @xmath4 ; age , @xmath5 ; initial mass function , imf ) . in detail , 0.00010.03 and 015 gyr are taken for the ranges of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , and two widely used imfs are taken in the work .",
    "the two imfs are presented by @xcite and @xcite respectively and are listed in table 1 .",
    "lll imf name & imf expression & example models + salpeter & @xmath6 @xmath7 & @xcite , @xcite +   +   + chabrier & @xmath8,~~(m \\leq 1m_\\odot ; ~m_{\\rm c } = 0.08 m_\\odot , \\sigma = 0.69)\\\\          \\\\",

    "1m_\\odot )       \\end{array }     \\right.$ ] &  @xcite +   +   +    we use a monte carlo method to generate the binary sample of bs - ssps . for each binary",
    ", we generate the masses of two components ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) , the separation between the two components ( @xmath11 ) , and the eccentricity of the binary ( @xmath12 ) . for ss - ssps",
    ", we just evolve stars independently .",
    "therefore , the bs - ssps and ss - ssps have the same star sample .",
    "we take the same distribution as @xcite and @xcite for @xmath13 , and a distribution as @xcite for @xmath11 .",
    "the detailed process for generating the input parameters is as follows .",
    "first , we generate the mass of the primary , @xmath9 , within the range of 0.1100 @xmath14 , according to an imf .",
    "next we generate the ratio ( @xmath13 ) of the mass of the secondary to that of the primary randomly within 01 , due to an a uniform distribution @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "then the mass of the secondary star is given by @xmath13.@xmath9 .",
    "one can also refer to @xcite .",
    "second , we generate the separation ( @xmath11 ) of two components of a binary following the assumption that the fraction of binary in an interval of log(@xmath11 ) is constant when @xmath11 is big ( 10@xmath17 @xmath18 5.75 @xmath19 10@xmath20@xmath17 ) and it falls off smoothly when when @xmath11 is small ( @xmath21 10@xmath17 ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath11 can be written as @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this distribution implies that about 50% ( the typical value of the galaxy , see @xcite ) of stars are in binaries with orbital periods less than 100 yr .",
    "third , we generate the eccentricity ( @xmath12 ) of each binary system using a uniform distribution , in the range of 01 , as @xcite .",
    "actually , the distribution of @xmath12 affects the stellar population synthesis results slightly , according to @xcite .      to build an useful database for stellar population synthesis , the isochrone database has to contain all the data needed in stellar population synthesis .",
    "three stellar - evolution parameters ( effective temperature , @xmath25 , surface gravity , log(@xmath26 ) , and luminosity , log(@xmath27 ) ) of stars in populations are important for stellar population synthesis and we include them into the database . in the work ,",
    "each stellar population consists of 2000000 binaries or 4000000 single stars .",
    "in fact , the sample contains two times of stars in the sample of @xcite and some satisfying population synthesis results can be obtained via such a sample ( see @xcite for more details ) . to make the library can be used combining with most widely used spectra libraries to calculate the integrated specialities such as spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and magnitudes of stellar populations , we take wide ranges for the stellar - evolution parameters .",
    "the ranges are wider than those of most stellar spectra libraries , e.g. , basel 3.1 @xcite , stelib @xcite , and the library of @xcite . in detail ,",
    "our results are presented within the range of 2000  60000 k for @xmath25 , and -1.5  6 for log(@xmath26 ) .    to save disk space , the stellar - evolution parameters of stellar populations",
    "are given by a statistical method .",
    "in other words , the database supplies us with approximate distributions of stars in the log(@xmath26 ) versus @xmath25 grid ( hereafter @xmath28-grid ) , i.e. , approximate isochrones , rather than the stellar - evolution parameters of each star .",
    "the detailed procedure is as follows .",
    "first , we divide @xmath28-grid into 1089701 sub - grids , with intervals of 0.01 and 40 k for log(@xmath26 ) and @xmath25 , respectively . the two intervals lead to an average uncertainty of 0.81% in stellar population synthesis results , which is smaller than those caused by the hurley code ( 5% ) and most stellar spectra libraries ( e.g. , 35% for basel 3.1 ) .",
    "therefore , our results is accurate enough for most stellar population synthesis studies .",
    "second , for each stellar population , we count the stars locate in each sub - grid , and save the median log(@xmath26 ) , median @xmath25 , average log(@xmath27 ) and percentage of stars in the sub - grid . the reason for saving the median values rather than the average values of log(@xmath26 ) and",
    "@xmath29 is that the two kinds of values lead to almost the same stellar population synthesis results but each pair of median log(@xmath26 ) and @xmath25 corresponds to a fixed sub - grid of the @xmath28-grid and they can be used more conveniently in stellar population synthesis studies .",
    "the four parameters can describe the isochrones and hertzsprung ",
    "russell diagrams ( hrds ) of stellar populations .",
    "they can also be used for calculating the average surface area of stars in each sub - grid .      as a whole ,",
    "the isochrone database contains the distributions of @xmath25 , log(@xmath26 ) , and log(@xmath27 ) of stars , i.e. , isochrones of bs - ssps and ss - ssps .",
    "the age range for the database is 015 gyr , with an interval of 0.1 gyr , and the metallicity range is 0.00010.03 ( 0.0001 , 0.0003 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.02 and 0.03 ) . in special",
    ", the data for stellar populations with salpeter and chabrier imfs are presented .",
    "the database can be used to model the cmds of star clusters and calculate the integrated specialities of stellar populations .",
    "the database can be obtained by on request to the authors or via the cds in the future .    to understand the database more expediently",
    ", we show the isochrones of metal - poor ( @xmath4=0.0001 ) , solar - metallicity ( @xmath4=0.02 ) and metal - rich ( @xmath4=0.03 ) stellar populations in figs . 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "the populations here have salpeter imf .",
    "note that we take stellar populations with salpeter imf as our standard models and we only show the results for standard models in the whole paper .",
    "in the figures , both the isochrones of bs - ssps and ss - ssps are shown , which can help us to understand the effects of binary interactions on stellar population synthesis .",
    "we see clearly that the isochrones of bs - ssps are different significantly from those of ss - ssps .",
    "we will find that the isochrones of bs - ssps are closer to those of star clusters when we fit the cmds of two star clusters later .",
    "the isochrone database above enables quickly calculating the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of stellar populations , and then the lick observatory image dissector scanner indices ( lick indices ) and colour indices .",
    "besides the method does not need to evolve each star , it computes only one time for the spectra of stars in each sub - grid of the @xmath28-grid .",
    "therefore , via such technique , we can calculate the integrated peculiarities of stellar populations very quickly .",
    "we call this stellar population synthesis technique and model _ rapid stellar population synthesis ( @xmath0)_. it actually takes much less ( about one of 100000 ) time than the method used by , e.g. , @xcite",
    ". therefore , the @xmath0 method makes it more convenient to take binary interactions into account when modeling the formation and evolution of galaxies . in the work",
    ", we calculated the seds , lick indices and colour indices for bs - ssps and ss - ssps .",
    "they can be conveniently used for future studies .",
    "we calculated the seds and 25 widely used lick indices for bs - ssps and ss - ssps with two imfs .",
    "the high - resolution stellar spectra library of @xcite ( hereafter martins library ) was used for the work .",
    "the library was computed with the latest results of stellar atmospheres studies and covers a @xmath25 range from 3000 to 55000 k and a log(@xmath26 ) range from -0.5 to 5.5 .",
    "in particular , the library enables modeling the spectra of stellar populations at a 0.3 @xmath30 resolution .",
    "thus the library is suitable for spectral studies of stellar populations of galaxies and star clusters .",
    "however , the metallicity coverage of the library is only from 0.002 to 0.04 . in figs .",
    "4 , 5 and 6 , we show the sed evolution of bs - ssps with metallicities of 0.004 , 0.02 and 0.03 , respectively . as we see , as that of ss - ssps ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , the continuum trends to be redder with increasing age of bs - ssp and the metallicity of bs - ssp affects the metal line ( e.g. , fe lines with central wavelengths of 5270 and 5335 @xmath30 ) strengths obviously .",
    "we can also check the effects of stellar age and metallicity via some lick indices . in figs . 7 , 8 , 9 and 10",
    ", we plotted the evolution of four widely used lick indices .",
    "the indices shown are computed from seds with a 0.3 @xmath30 resolution , but we also calculated the indices on the lick system .",
    "note the work calculates the lick indices of populations from seds , but zhang et al.s works calculate the indices on the lick system using some fitting functions .",
    "the figures ( 7 , 8 and 9 ) show that the stellar metallicity affects the age - sensitive line index h@xmath31 slightly , while it affects metallicity - sensitive indices ( mgb , fe5270 , and fe5335 ) strongly , and the stellar age changes the h@xmath31 index similarly for populations with various metallicities .",
    "therefore , the line indices of bs - ssps have similar age and metallicity sensitivities as those of ss - ssps .",
    "this suggests that when we take bs - ssp models instead of ss - ssp models to study the stellar populations of galaxies , we can use h@xmath31 together with [ mgfe ] @xcite to give estimates for the age and metallicity of populations . to check the reliability of our @xmath0 technique",
    ", we also plotted the results derived by @xcite in figs . 7 , 8 , 9 and 10 .",
    "the two models took the same imf , stellar evolution code and spectra library , and both of them are bs - ssp models , but their age ranges , star samples and computing method are different .",
    "it is shown that the @xmath0 model gave line indices similar to those of the previous work , but the indices obtained by this work evolve more smoothly .",
    "the reason is that we take 2000000 binaries for a bs - ssp in the work but it is 1000000 in the previous work .",
    "note that we obtained different metal indices for bs - ssps with metallicity of 0.01 .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the martins library supplies the same set of spectra for stars with metallicities ( [ @xmath4/h ] ) of -0.3 and -0.5 .",
    "we took the set of spectra as the spectra of stars with [ @xmath4/h ] = -0.3 , but the same set of spectra were taken as the spectra of stars with [ @xmath4/h ] = -0.5 in the work of @xcite , when calculating the seds of populations with metallicity ( @xmath4 ) of 0.01 .",
    "the good consistency of our results with those of the previous work suggests that our isochrone database can be used reliably for stellar population studies .",
    "furthermore , we find that the abrupt change of indices between 1 and 2 gyr are possibly caused by the phase transitions of stars with initial mass between about 1.57 and 2 @xmath32 .",
    "such stars are in core helium burning stage and have high luminosities between 1 and 2 gyr . as a result",
    ", it leads to a irregularity in the line indices and colours ( see @xcite for comparison ) .",
    "however , the values of indices in the age range are possibly affected by the rough calculation of the evolution of stars by the hurley code .",
    "a few works have tried to model the populations of galaxies and star clusters via bs - ssps ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but there is no near - infrared colour indices presented .",
    "in fact , such colours are very important for disentangling the well - known degeneracy @xcite and useful for exploring the stellar populations of distant galaxies ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", the colours obtained by previous works ( e.g. , @xcite ) do not evolve smoothly . in this work",
    ", we calculated some colours that are potentially useful for stellar population studies .",
    "the basel 3.1 spectra library @xcite was used for calculating the colours of populations because the wavelength coverage of martins library is only from 3000 to 7000 @xmath33 . note that we take a different method to calculate the colours of populations compared to the works of @xcite .",
    "the colours in our work are calculated by integrating seds , rather than by interpolating a photometry library ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the johnson @xmath2 colours are usually used for stellar population studies .",
    "we calculated them for both bs - ssps and ss - ssps with salpeter and chabrier imfs .",
    "as an example , we plot the evolution of four colours of bs - ssps with salpeter imf in fig . 11 . as we see",
    ", colours increase quickly with stellar age when the age is less than about 2 gyr and then they evolve slowly .",
    "the reason is that the colours of young populations are dominated by massive stars , which evolve very quickly before about 2 gyr . on the other hand , the colours of old (",
    "@xmath34 2 gyr ) populations are mainly dominated by less massive stars , which evolve more slowly than massive stars .",
    "the figure shows that at fixed metallicity , colours become redder with increasing age . at fixed stellar age , colours become redder with increasing stellar metallicity .",
    "therefore , the stellar age and metallicity have similar effects on colours of stellar populations .",
    "this is very the well - known age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "therefore , it is impossible to disentangle the effects of stellar age and metallicity completely .",
    "we can not give reliable estimate for stellar age or metallicity using only one colour .",
    "however , using a pair of colours , some constraints on the two stellar - population parameters can be obtained , because the age and metallicity sensitivities of each colour are usually different @xcite .",
    "compared to the results of @xcite , the colours calculated by this work evolve more smoothly .",
    "we do not compare them here , as this can be understood from the comparison of lick indices .",
    "this is actually the first work to calculate colours relating to near - infrared bands ( e.g. , @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) for bs - ssps .",
    "note that @xmath37 is sensitive to stellar age while @xmath38 and @xmath39 to metallicity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) supplies a good deal of observational data for astronomy studies and it takes an @xmath3 system ( hereafter sdss-@xmath3 system ) . in order to use its photometry data for stellar population studies more",
    "conveniently , we calculated some colours on the sdss-@xmath3 system . in fig .",
    "12 , we show the evolution of four colours .",
    "we see that sdss-@xmath3 colours have similar peculiarities as @xmath2 colours .",
    "note that colour @xmath40 is an age - sensitive colour and can be used to give constraints on stellar - population parameters together with colours such as @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this is the first work to present the sdss-@xmath3 colours for bs - ssps .      because it is shown that some colours relating to both @xmath42 and @xmath3 magnitudes are more powerful than either @xmath42 or @xmath3 colours for disentangling the stellar age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy @xcite , we computed some such colours and call them _",
    "composite colours_. in detail , we calculated some colours consist of johnson @xmath42 magnitudes and sdss-@xmath3 magnitudes .",
    "the evolution of four composite colours is shown in fig . 13 . according to the work of @xcite , @xmath43 and",
    "@xmath44 are sensitive to stellar age while @xmath41 and @xmath45 to stellar metallicity .      in this section ,",
    "we show the color - color grids for two pairs of colours ( hereafter colour pairs ) of bs - ssps of our standard models .",
    "the two pairs were shown to have the potential for disentangling the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy @xcite via ss - ssps of @xcite .",
    "they can possibly be used to separate the stellar metallicity and age when bs - ssps are used instead of ss - ssps .",
    "the two pairs are [ @xmath46 , [ @xmath47 . the detailed colour - colour grids of them can be seen in figs .",
    "14 and 15 .",
    "we find that the two colour - colour grids can disentangle the age ",
    "metallicity degeneracy via bs - ssps .",
    "therefore , the two colour pairs can be used for stellar population studies . however , the uncertainties in stellar age and metallicity of metal - poor ( @xmath4 @xmath48 0.001 ) and old ( age @xmath34 12 gyr ) populations seem larger than others . note that this two pairs are not necessarily the best pairs for stellar population study .",
    "some other potential pairs can be found in our previous paper @xcite and it is better to choose colours according to the stellar - population peculiarities of galaxies .      because most stellar population synthesis models are ss - ssp models and they have been widely used for previous works , it is necessary to compare the results ( i.e. , lick indices and colours ) of bs - ssp model with those of ss - ssps .",
    "we have a try in this work .",
    "we only compare our results with those of the ss - ssps of the model of @xcite ( bc03 model ) as most ss - ssp models gave similar lick indices and colours for the same stellar population ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the results can help us to understand how the difference between the results obtained via ss - ssp models and those obtained via bs - ssp models is . in figs .",
    "16 and 17 , we compare four widely used lick indices and four colours of two kinds of ssps .",
    "both the bs - ssp model and ss - ssp model take the salpeter imf and calculate their colours via basel 3.1 library , but the spectra libraries used to calculate the lick indices by two models are various .",
    "our bs - ssp model takes the martins @xcite library and bc03 ss - ssp model mainly takes stelib @xcite library . note that the lick indices and colours of bc03 ss - ssps with metallicities of 0.01 and 0.03 were interpolated because they were not given directly by the bc03 model .",
    "thus the values of the colours and lick indices of bc03 ss - ssps with metallicities of 0.01 and 0.03 are possibly different from those calculated by seds . from fig .",
    "16 we can find that a bs - ssp usually has larger h@xmath31 index and less metal indices than a bc03 ss - ssp when the two kinds of ssps have the same stellar age and metallicity .",
    "we are also shown that four colours of a bs - ssp are bluer than those of an ss - ssp with the same age and metallicity .",
    "therefore , ss - ssp models will usually measure different values for the stellar ages and metallicities of galaxies compared to bs - ssp models .",
    "however , it seems that ss - ssp models and bs - ssp models can give similar results for relative studies , because stellar age and metallicity affect lick indices and colours of the two kinds of populations similarly .",
    "besides modeling stellar populations , the isochrone database can be used for cmd fitting .",
    "here we fitted the cmds of star clusters m67 and ngc1868 , via both bs - ssps and ss - ssps .",
    "the colours and magnitudes were taken from the stellar population challenge of iau symposium 241 ( iaus 241 ) ( http://www.astro.rug.nl/@xmath49sctrager/challenge/ ) and the basel 2.2 @xcite spectra library was used to translate the data of our isochrone database to cmds of stellar populations .",
    "we fitted the cmds of the two above star clusters via stellar populations with two imfs .",
    "first , we fitted the cmds via populations with salpeter imf . as a result , via both bs - ssps and ss - ssps , star cluster m67 was shown to have the solar metallicity and a 4.6 gyr age , with a distance modulus of 9.8 and a colour excess e(b - v ) of 0.09 .",
    "the stellar metallicity and age of ngc1868 are found to be 0.004 and 1.4 gyr , respectively , with 18.8 for its distance modulus and 0.04 for colour excess , e(v - i ) .",
    "note that we only took stellar populations with seven metallicities and 151 ages for our fittings , according to the data of our isochrone database . in the work ,",
    "cmds were fitted by comparing the theoretical and observational percentage of stars in each sub - grid of the @xmath28-grid compared to the total number of stars in the observed colour and magnitude ranges . because stars after the turn - off point are very important for determining stellar metallicity and the data of luminous stars are more reliable than those of less luminous stars ,",
    "the percentage of stars in each sub - grid of @xmath28-grid are weighted using their luminosities . for convenience , we using 10@xmath50 instead of the real luminosities of stars .",
    "note that @xmath28-grids of populations were expressed by cmds in the fitting . here",
    "all stars are assumed to be distinguishable , as the limitation of the database .",
    "however , it is actually different from the true case , especially for the distant star clusters .",
    "the fittings of the cmds of m67 and ngc1868 are shown in fig .",
    "some sub - grids were not plotted because each of them contains less than 0.5 luminosity - weighted stars and are not important for fitting the cmds when taking a luminosity - weighted fit method .",
    "as we see , compared to ss - ssps , bs - ssps can fit some special objects such as blue stragglers of m67 and as a whole , bs - ssps fitted the shapes of the cmds of two star clusters better .",
    "this suggests that the isochrones of bs - ssps are closer to those of real star clusters or galaxies .",
    "it seems that ssps can fit the cmd of m67 well , but they fit the cmd of ngc1878 not so well .",
    "the best - fit cmd of ngc1868 shows obviously different for the part with v magnitude more luminous than about 22.5 mag .",
    "this possibly results from that we assume each star of the star cluster can be distinguished but actually many stars of ngc1868 were not distinguished in observation .",
    "in fact , it is impossible to distinguish each star of the star cluster , because the star cluster is too distant ( with distance modulus larger than 18 ) .",
    "if some binary stars in the best bs - ssp - fit population of ngc1868 can not be distinguished , the cmd will be different from the one shown in fig .",
    "18 , and it will be possibly more similar to the observational cmd . when we fitted the cmds of the two star clusters via stellar populations with chabrier imf , we got similar results .",
    "it implies that even if populations with different assumptions ( imf , bs - ssp or ss - ssp ) are used , we can get reliable estimates for the stellar ages and metallicities of star clusters via fitting cmds .",
    "note that the results of cmd fitting is usually affected by the fitting method , thus the above results are not always the best - fit results .",
    "in addition , because we only use populations with seven metallicities to fit the populations of the two star clusters , perhaps the results will change if we take populations with more metallicities for fitting .",
    "we first presented an isochrone database for quickly modeling both single star and binary star simple stellar populations ( ss - ssps and bs - ssps ) .",
    "the isochrone database only causes 0.81% uncertainty in stellar population synthesis results on average .",
    "thus it can be widely used for stellar population studies of galaxies and star clusters .",
    "however , there are some points should be noted when applying the database .",
    "first , because the star sample of populations was generated via monte carlo technique , the stellar mass distribution of a population is not continuous . as a result",
    ", some line indices and colours possibly evolve with stellar age less smoothly compared to those calculated via isochrone synthesis method ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is more obvious for some near - infrared colours .",
    "second , the isochrone database can only model stellar populations with metallicities from 0.0001 to 0.03 , because the hurley code can not evolve stars with other metallicities . in the work",
    ", we only calculated the isochrones of populations with seven metallicities ( 0.0001 , 0.0003 , 0.001 , 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.02 and 0.03 ) , because stars with other metallicities can not be evolved as well as stars with the above seven metallicities via hurley code .",
    "furthermore , the distributions of the input parameters of binaries can affect our results .",
    "in the work , we took a uniform distribution for the mass ratio of a binary , @xmath13 , as it is the widely used distribution .",
    "however , the masses of the two components of a binary perhaps are not correlated or the distribution of @xmath13 is not a uniform distribution .",
    "if it is that case , we will possibly get some various results .",
    "in addition , we only present the isochrone database for two widely used imfs , as the limitation of our computing ability .",
    "there are actually some other types for the imf of stellar populations .",
    "we intend to study further in the future .",
    "although we mainly aim to model simple stellar populations ( bs - ssps and ss - ssps ) , the isochrone database can be used to model composite stellar populations ( csps ) .",
    "the database makes it easier to study the spectra and photometry evolution of galaxies via bs - ssps .",
    "this is useful for future studies on the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "it can also be used to study the effects of binary interactions on stellar population synthesis studies .",
    "in fact , to investigate how binary interactions affect the results of stellar population studies is very the topic of another work .",
    "then we introduced a rapid stellar population synthesis ( @xmath0 ) model based on our isochrone database .",
    "the @xmath0 model calculated high - resolution ( 0.3 @xmath33 ) spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , lick indices , and colour indices of bs - ssps and ss - ssps , for two widely used imfs . however , the seds and lick indices are available only for populations with metallicities of 0.004 , 0.01 , 0.02 and 0.03 .",
    "the reason is that the metallicity coverage of the spectra library used for calculating seds of stellar populations is 0.0020.04 .",
    "therefore , the metallicity range of theoretical populations is possibly not wide enough for some studies .",
    "however , @xmath42 colours , sdss-@xmath3 colours and composite colours are available for populations with metallicities from 0.0003 to 0.03 , which can be used to study the stellar - population parameters ( age and metallicity ) of most galaxies . when we compared four widely used lick indices and four colours of bs - ssps of rps model to those of ss - ssps of the bc03 model ( @xcite , bc03 ) , we found that some various results will be shown if we take bs - ssps instead of bc03 ss - ssps for stellar population studies .",
    "however , it seems that even if bs - ssps are used instead of ss - ssps for studies , the relative values of stellar populations will not change obviously , as stellar age and metallicity affect the lick indices and colours of bs - ssps and ss - ssps similarly .",
    "because the isochrone database can also be used to fit the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of star clusters , we fitted the cmds of two star clusters ( m67 and ngc1868 ) and gave their stellar metallicities , ages , distances and colour excesses , as examples .",
    "our results showed that bs - ssps can fit some special stars such as blue stragglers of star clusters , which can not be fitted by ss - ssps .",
    "this suggests that one should consider binary interactions in stellar population synthesis studies .",
    "however , because the database assumes that all stars in a stellar population are distinguishable and some stars of distant star clusters can usually not be distinguished ,",
    "the database is more suitable to fit the cmds of nearby star clusters . when the database is used to fit the cmds of very distant galaxies",
    ", one should take the above point into account .",
    "we thank a reviewer of mnras , profs .",
    "tinggui wan , hongyan zhou , fenghui zhang and drs .",
