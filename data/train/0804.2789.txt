    "the motivation for studying bubble plumes is evident , from the fact that these plumes are encountered in a variety of engineering problems . to mention a few ,",
    "plumes have been used to damp sea waves in harbours ( pneumatic breakwaters ) , to prevent surface ice formation in harbours , to mix stratified fluid layers , to re - aerate lakes , and finally to protect installations from shock waves produced by underwater explosions ( cf .",
    ", for instance , bhaumik , 2005 ) .    with increasing subsea activities plumes",
    "have acquired increased importance from a risk assessment point of view .",
    "it becomes imperative to obtain knowledge about the implications of a rupture , or even a breakage , of a subsea pipeline .",
    "thus in case of an underwater blowout of inflammable gas , one wishes answers to the following questions :    @xmath2 what is the concentration of gas at the free surface ?",
    "@xmath2 what is the extension of the area covered by gas at the free surface ?",
    "@xmath2 what is the rising time of the gas ?    the aim of the present work is to provide a theoretical framework from which answers to these questions can be given , in a quick and reasonably accurate way .",
    "our approach is based on the kinetic energy method , proposed by one of the present authors some years ago in the case of air - bubble plumes ( brevik 1977 , 1996,1999 ) .",
    "the essential generalization of the present paper is that we allow for dissolution of the gas . therewith",
    "a realistic answer to the first question above becomes in principle obtainable .",
    "especially when the plume is arising from large depths , the gas dissolution is expected to be an important factor .",
    "figure 1 sketches a plume coming from a gas release at depth @xmath3 .",
    "it is useful to divide the plume into three different zones : the zone of flow establishment ( zfe ) is characterized by high gas concentration and flow conditions changing rapidly with the height @xmath4 above the real source ( we thus do not introduce a virtual source being displaced some distance downward from the real source ) .",
    "then , there is a surface zone , characterized by an outward radial flow of entrained fluid , yielding a rapid increase of the effective width of the plume .",
    "the third zone , the one of main interest here , is the established flow zone characterized by the self - similarity property , implying that the flow has established some sort of self - governing equilibrium ( socolofsky et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "this means that the time averaged cross - sectional profiles of the plume parameters maintain a near - gaussian form .",
    "the plume parameters are fully determined by a centerline value and a width , both being a function of the height @xmath4 .",
    "the gaussian form of the plume parameters has been verified in several experiments ; cf .",
    ", for instance , kubasch ( 2001 ) .",
    "[ fig : plume ]    as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : plume ] the radius of the plume is @xmath5 , describing the water boundary , and the centerline vertical velocity @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , the dispersive phase is bounded by a characteristic radius @xmath7 , where @xmath8 .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 is introduced in order to account for the fact that the dispersed phase forms a `` core '' , whereas the entrained fluid forms a wider conical structure .",
    "@xmath9 is thus the relative width of the inner core compared to the outer water flow boundary .    in the present paper",
    "we will be concerned with the zone of established flow only , as this zone is the dominant one in cases of moderate or large depths .",
    "we will ignore the phenomenon of detrainment ( or peeling ) , which may occur in the case of stratification , or if the density of entrained fluid is significantly increased due to dissolution of the dispersive phase ( i.e. , the gas bubbles ) .",
    "it is useful to distinguish between _ single- _ and _ multiphase _ plumes .",
    "the main difference being in the discrete nature of the buoyant dispersive phase . in a single phase plume",
    "the buoyancy is well mixed with the bulk fluid and the advection of buoyancy is controlled by the motion of fluid alone . for the multiphase plume",
    "the dispersed phase itself supplies the buoyancy to the plume and the distribution in the plume is controlled both by its own dynamics and by the motion of the bulk plume fluid .",
    "this distinction is especially important in the case of stratification , and in the case of cross - flows .",
    "if cross - flows are present a separation between the dispersed and entrained phases can occur , yielding a behaviour qualitatively different from the characteristic plume behaviour .",
    "an extensive experimental study of multiphase plumes has been carried out by socolofsky ( 2001 ) .",
    "a great deal of effort has been laid down to describe the behaviour of multiphase plumes .",
    "the main focus of modelling has been on integral models , considering the integral of relevant plume parameters over appropriate control volumes .",
    "the dynamics of the plume parameters is governed by coupled differential equations derived from first principles and/or closure models for turbulence , mass transfer , heat transfer , and entrainment .    according to the entrainment hypothesis , as introduced by morton et al .",
    "( 1956 ) , the rate of entrainment at the edge of the plume is proportional to some characteristic velocity at that height .",
    "the characteristic velocity is taken to be the centerline velocity @xmath6 at that height , and the proportionality constant is the entrainment coefficient @xmath1 .",
    "mathematically , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the volumetric flux of entrainment water .",
    "two different strategies are followed when dealing with multiphase plumes .",
    "they depend in turn on the way in which the multiphase nature of the problem is treated . a single plume model ( or mixed - fluid model )",
    "treats the plume as a mixture of dispersed phase and entrained fluid .",
    "if the ambient fluid can be considered as a stagnant and unstratisfied fluid , one calls this a _ simple _ plume .",
    "simple plume models have been considered in various contexts .",
    "morton et al .",
    "( 1956 ) used a simple plume model in their paper introducing the entrainment hypothesis ; milgram ( 1983 ) compared his experimental results with the values predicted by a simple plume model , whereas west et al .",
    "( 1982 ) used both a simple plume model with the entrainment hypothesis to describe the effect of dissolving plumes .",
    "the work of brevik ( 1977 ) is also based on a simple plume formulation , though without making use of the entrainment hypothesis .",
    "a different strategy used to deal with the multiphase nature of the plume is to use the concept of two - fluid models , namely to treat each phase separately and introduce coupling terms in the differential equations for each phase .",
    "this superimposition of two plume - like structure leads to a formalism called a _",
    "double - plume _ model ( or two - fluid model ) . in the past",
    ", two - fluid models have been implemented only together with the entrainment hypothesis .",
    "mcdougall ( 1978 ) modelled the system as an inner circular plume containing the gas bubbles and some entrainment water , and an annular plume containing only water .",
    "the formalism of mcdougall was generalized by asaeda and imberger ( 1993 ) , and by crounse et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , simplifying the implementation of density effects of dissolving bubbles .",
    "an extensive comparison between mixed and two - fluid models based on the entrainment hypothesis is given by bhaumik ( 2005 ) .",
    "the advantages of the integral models are that the governing equations allow insight into the flow dynamics ; they are computationally efficient and produce reasonable results in many cases .",
    "a drawback is that the integral models lose their validity as the plume becomes less self - similar ( socolofsky et al , 2002 ) .    in the next section",
    "we summarize the key properties of the kinetic energy model . in section 3",
    "we solve the nondimensional governing equations and determine the values of the parameters , especially the correlation parameter @xmath0 , so as to get a reasonably good agreement with existing experiments .",
    "section 4 is devoted to large - scale case studies , of importance for the oil industry . in section 5",
    "we analyze the sensitivity of the introduced parameters .",
    "the model forming the basis of our present investigation is the kinetic energy model presented by brevik and killie ( 1996 ) for axisymmetric air - bubble plumes , now generalized so as to account for dissolution of the dissolved phase . here",
    "the semi - empirical ranz - marshall equation ( 1952 ) is important for predicting the gas dissolution .",
    "this is moreover similar to the approach of west et al .",
    "( 1992 ) ; they describe dissolving plumes using the entrainment hypothesis .",
    "our model is based on a mixed - fluid formalism , and intends to describe a simple bubble plume in the established zone .",
    "we shall predict the width , dissolution and the rise time of a plume originating from the source lying at depth @xmath3 ( @xmath12 ) .      consider first the gas dissolution .",
    "the rate of mass transferred from the dispersed phase to the ambient fluid follows from the ranz - marshall equation ( 1952 ) : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mass of one spherical bubble with radius @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the solubility of the dispersed phase , @xmath17 is the local concentration of the dissolved species in the ambient fluid , and @xmath18 is the mass transfer coefficient .    whereas the original ranz - marshall equation was derived to describe the evaporation of pure liquid drops , the equation has later been successfully applied to describe dissolution of gas bubbles ( west 1992 , crounse 2007 , johansen 2000 ) , and has become a standard in this area of research . the coefficient @xmath18 depends on bubble size and flow parameters , as discussed by west ( 1992 ) , zheng and yapa ( 2002 ) , and crounse ( 2007 ) .",
    "zheng and yapa ( 2002 ) combine equations from earlier works to derive a general formula for @xmath18 for bubbles in water . assuming spherical bubbles of radius @xmath15 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 cm",
    ", @xmath21 is the bubble slip velocity , and @xmath22 is the molecular diffusivity of gas in the liquid .",
    "as the mass of a bubble is @xmath23 with @xmath24 the gas density , we may insert this into ( [ 2 ] ) and moreover make use of the equation @xmath25 which follows from the assumption of isothermal expansion . here",
    "@xmath26 is the gas density at the surface , @xmath27 is the pressure at the free surface expressed as a head of water column , and @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to the following equation for the height dependence of the bubble radius : @xmath29 @xmath30 being the vertical velocity of a bubble .    consider next the mixed - fluid continuity equation by summing the standard continuity equations for each phase over the two phases .",
    "the density @xmath31 of the mixture is @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the phase fractions of the liquid and gas phases . assuming that @xmath34 ( or @xmath35 ) , the last term in ( [ 6 ] ) is negligible .",
    "furthermore , we assume @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ambient fluid density , taken to be constant .",
    "consequently the ( stationary ) continuity equation for an axisymmetric plume can be written as @xmath38      performing the same kind of averaging procedures as in earlier papers ( brevik and killie 1996 , brevik and kluge 1999 ) , now including gas dissolution , and using the approximation ( [ 7 ] ) meaning that all momentum contributions from the dissolved phase are neglected apart from the buoyant term , we can write down the @xmath4 component of the momentum equation for the fluid mixture .",
    "we assume that the plume is fully turbulent , so that the velocity field can be reynolds decomposed into a mean value and a fluctuating term .",
    "viscous stresses are small and negligible compared to turbulent stresses . for the averaged navier - stokes equation we obtain , in standard notation , @xmath39= -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\bar{p } - \\rho_w g + \\rho_w \\alpha_g g \\label{9}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the gravitational acceleration .",
    "the mean pressure @xmath41 can be written as a sum of a dynamic and a hydrostatic part , @xmath42 .",
    "thus the right hand side of ( [ 9 ] ) simplifies to @xmath43 . introducing the reynolds stresses , @xmath44 and making use of the continuity equation ( [ 8 ] ) , we can write the correlations in ( [ 9 ] ) as @xmath45 = - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}\\tau_{rz } - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial z}\\tau_{zz } - \\frac{\\tau_{rz}}{r } \\approx - \\frac{1}{r}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r } ( r \\tau_{rz } ) \\label{11}\\ ] ] where it is assumed that the lateral variations of the reynolds stresses are dominating .",
    "the momentum equation thus reduces to the form @xmath46 this equation is integrated over a cylindric control volume having the boundaries @xmath47 $ ] ( @xmath48 arbitrary ) , and @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "the boundary conditions are summarized in table [ tab : bound ] .",
    ".boundary conditions for integration of momentum and kinetic energy equations [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : res3 ]",
    "in order to investigate the robustness of the model , a sensitivity analysis of critical parameters is conducted .",
    "sensitivity analyses for @xmath9 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath22 and @xmath0 are performed keeping other variables constant . in the sensitivity analysis",
    "the effects of parameter variation on the plume width @xmath53 , mass - flux at the surface @xmath54 and the mean centerline velocity @xmath55 are investigated .",
    "the prediction of the mass - flux of the dispersed phase is relatively robust .",
    "some variation ( @xmath56 1% ) is found when varying the bubble radius @xmath15 , ( smaller bubbles yielding more dissolution ) and when varying the molecular diffusitivity @xmath22 ( larger diffusitivities yielding more dissolution ) .",
    "these findings are in accordance to those found by west ( 1992 ) .",
    "the width of the plume @xmath53 and mean centerline velocity @xmath55 show little sensitivity to these parameters , suggesting that the dissolution itself has little influence on the other plume properties , as long as the dissolution is moderate .",
    "the analysis shows that the parameters of interest are insensitive to variations of the diffuser radius @xmath50 and the densimetric froude number @xmath52 .",
    "the froude number @xmath52 does however have some influence on the centerline velocity @xmath6 within the zone of flow establishment ( zfe ) , but the curves coincide further from the source .",
    "this suggests that details about the initial conditions are only important only within the zfe and that the large scale dynamics of the plume is determined by other parameters .",
    "the analysis shows a strong sensitivity to the parameter @xmath0 , an increase in @xmath0 of 20% yielding an increase in the plume width of approximately 20% . this strong dependence upon @xmath0",
    "is expected and is similar to the dependence upon the entrainment coefficient @xmath1 when the entrainment hypothesis is adopted .",
    "the sensitivity analysis also shows a strong dependence upon the relative distribution width @xmath9 , giving an increase in the plume width @xmath53 of approximately 40% for an increase of 20% in @xmath9 .",
    "authors using the entrainment hypothesis have claimed that results obtained are insensitive to the relative distribution width @xmath9 ( bhaumik ( 2005 ) , socolofsky et .",
    "2002 ) , west ( 1992 ) , milgram ( 1983 ) ) .",
    "the discrepancy between the well established theory in the literature and the model presented in the present work can be related to the use of the entrainment hypothesis .",
    "use of the entrainment hypothesis allows forming a set of non dimensional differential equations which do not depend explicitly on @xmath9 , as shown for line sources by ditmars and cederwall ( 1974 ) .",
    "such a transformation is however not possible in the formalism based on the kinetic energy approach , giving an explicit dependence of @xmath9 possibly explaining this discrepancy .    even though models based on the entrainment hypothesis are relatively insensitive to @xmath9 , little agreement is found in the literature on how this parameter should be chosen , suggesting that the physics behind @xmath9 is not clearly understood .",
    "the sensitivity analysis suggests that increasing the value of @xmath9 yields an increasing plume width @xmath53 and a decreasing centerline velocity @xmath6 , meaning that the more the bubbles spread out , the more efficient they are at entraining water .",
    "this suggests the possibility that @xmath9 should _ not _ be taken as a constant , but should depend on properties of the plume .",
    "this is an issue that ought to get some focus in future experimental or theoretical investigations .",
    "[ fig : lambdai ]    as an alternative to the assumption that @xmath9 is dependent on flow properties , one could investigate if the effect of choosing a different value of @xmath9 could be incorporated in another of the free parameters of the plume .",
    "the sensitivity analysis suggests that a change in @xmath9 could be compensated for by a change in @xmath0 .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : lambdai ] , changing the value of @xmath9 from 0.8 to 0.5 , changes @xmath0 from 0.151 to 0.235 in order to obtain a satisfactory fit between theory and experiment .",
    "it is thus possible to incorporate changes in @xmath9 in the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 and obtain , at least qualitatively , the same results .",
    "if such an approach is to be used , it should be noted that the coefficients of equation [ eq : iex ] should be determined for the new values of @xmath9 as the equation only is valid under the assumption that @xmath57 .",
    "1 : :    the literature contains just a few experimental data sets that are    suitable for comparison with model results .",
    "this is especially the    case for large rates of release , yielding poor grounds for    extrapolation of the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0    into these regions .",
    "controlled laboratory experiments yield good    grounds for comparison but are carried out at relatively small rates    of release and small depths , making it difficult to determine the    importance of dissolution . 2 : :    the model does not distinguish between the zone of flow establishment    and zone of established flow .",
    "the effects of the zone of flow    establishment are believed to be handled by choosing the initial    conditions accordingly . in the comparative study between existing    models carried out by bhaumik ( 2005 )",
    "the approach using a densimetric    froude number @xmath58 introduced by west ( 1992 ) is found to    be superior to its alternatives .",
    "the model used in the present work    shows little sensitivity to the initial froude number    @xmath52 for the flow within the zone of established flow ,    suggesting that future work should focus on more important parameters    such as the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 , rather    than determining exact initial conditions . 3 : :    in the case of strong stratification",
    "the model given in the present    work will not be valid as effects like detrainment are not considered .",
    "this double plume structure can be described by means of a double    plume model as found in mcdougall ( 1978 ) and asaeda and imberger    ( 1993 ) .",
    "these models are based on the entrainment hypothesis and yield    entrainment equations for each of the plumes involved , thus    introducing a higher level of complexity .",
    "an equivalent approach for    the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 should be    introduced if the kinetic energy approach is to advance further . 4 : :    the lateral variations of the turbulent stresses are assumed to be    dominating over influence from vertical turbulence . as pointed out by    brevik and kluge ( 1999 )",
    ", the desirability of taking turbulence    stresses into account has been emphasized by earlier workers in the    field .",
    "brevik and kluge ( 1999 ) model the effects of vertical    turbulence by introducing a correction factor @xmath59 .",
    "the    work of these authors show that the factor @xmath59 is    interrelated to the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 .",
    "their work indicates that no definite value of @xmath59 can be    assigned in advance to an experimental situation without knowing    details of the turbulence generating geometry of the source . a large    value of @xmath59 ( @xmath59 = 0.3 ) is introduced in    order to fit the model to the experimental data of milgram ( 1983 ) .",
    "correlations between @xmath59 and @xmath0 ought to be    further investigated .",
    "in the present work , the kinetic energy approach to buoyant plumes of brevik ( 1977 ) and brevik and killie ( 1996 ) is generalized in order to allow for dissolution of gas .",
    "the model is compared to experiments carried out by milgram ( 1983 ) and is found to reproduce experimental data with satisfactory accuracy .",
    "the results presented suggest that the model presented yields a good starting point for the description of the dynamics and dissolution of gas in the zone of established flow for an air - bubble plume , given that the turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 is chosen correctly .",
    "the benefit of models based on the entrainment hypothesis is that the concept is relatively well understood and implemented for various uses .",
    "the major drawback of the approach is the difficulty of determining the value of the entrainment coefficient from parameters which are simple to measure .    besides being relatively simple to implement , having fast convergence and promising accuracy when compared to experiments , the idea of using a conservation equation for the kinetic energy",
    "is especially interesting from a physical point of view , as it provides insight into the physics driving the plume .",
    "the mathematical framework needed is somewhat more complicated , but more physics is contained in the model .",
    "the model presented should thus be seen as an alternative to models based on the entrainment hypothesis , with the potential of answering relevant questions without excluding relevant physics .",
    "another positive aspect of the kinetic energy approach is that the unknown turbulent correlation parameter @xmath0 can be determined from parameters that are easily accessible .",
    "a combination of the simplicity of the entrainment hypothesis and the solid physical grounds of the kinetic energy approach should be sought in order to develop state of the art tools for future risk management of sub - sea gas releases , exploiting the benefits of both approaches .",
