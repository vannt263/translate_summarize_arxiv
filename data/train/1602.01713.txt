    "to study stellar activity at the lower end of the main sequence , all dwarf k and m type stars from the _ kepler _ database were selected . from those , using a simple fourier - transform search , we found a total of about 500 objects which exhibit light variations with short period(s ) of less than 2 days .",
    "these objects were further studied to identify those stars which have spots on their surfaces , and consequently show rotational modulation in their observed light curves .",
    "we eliminated targets with obvious binary modulation , including those in the _ kepler _ binary catalog .",
    "we also concluded that k - m dwarf stars could not pulsate with the periods and amplitudes observed ( @xmath06 hr to 2 days , and amplitudes of a few percent ) .",
    "more details about target selection and validation are found in @xcite .",
    "1 shows a typical example : kic  8416220 , which exhibits large flares ( left panel ) ; two close periods in the fourier transform ( right panel ) ; and short period light variations , including ` beats ' ( middle panel ) .",
    "the stability / variability of the light curves were further studied by tracking the phases of the base frequencies and their first harmonics . in the case of stable light curves ( e.g. , due to binary",
    "eclipses ) the phases behave simply and systematically with time .",
    "however , for modulation due to rotating starspots that may be differentially rotating , and can grow and decay with time , the phases of the base period and its first harmonic typically show erratic behaviour .",
    "2 shows an example for each of these cases . in the left panel , phase tracking of the contact binary kic  5128972",
    "is shown : the phase behaviour of the half period ( i.e. , due to the ellipsoidal light variation ) reflects the orbit of the close binary with respect to an inferred third body in the system .",
    "the right panel shows the typical erratic phase - tracking behavior of a spotted star , kic  10710753 .",
    "we followed the time behaviour of the light curves with short - term fourier transforms ( stft , `` sonograms '' ) which describe how the amplitudes and periods change with time .",
    "this approach gives good resolution both in time and in frequency . in these cases , data segments of about 30-day duration are fourier transformed , and the centers of the data intervals are shifted by 2 days between adjacent points in the sequence .",
    "the resulting amplitudes are then plotted as as function of frequency in the vertical direction , with time running along the horizontal axis .",
    "details of this method are given in @xcite .",
    "of the k - m dwarfs with short rotational periods , 54 ( 37 m stars and 17 k stars ) exhibit _ two or more _ independent periods .",
    "we found that differential rotation can not be the cause of the double or multiple periods .",
    "first , this scenario would require extremely long - lasting spots ( for several years ) , at different fixed latitudes which , based on our present knowledge of starspot behaviour , seems unlikely .",
    "more quantitatively , measured differences between periods due to differential rotation , typically have a mean shear parameter , d@xmath1 , of about 0.07 rad / day ( within a factor of @xmath02 for cool dwarfs ; see reinhold et al .",
    "2013 , for more details ) .",
    "this translates to a fractional differential rotation parameter for our objects , @xmath2(days ) , where @xmath3 is the stellar rotation period . from this",
    "it follows that rotation periods ( @xmath4 day ) which are different by more than a few percent from each other most likely do _ not _ originate from differential rotation .",
    "the independence of the observed multiple periods is further demonstrated by the `` sonogram '' analysis .",
    "the observational data and the fourier transform of kic  8416220 are plotted in fig .  1 , while the time - frequency analysis of the same stars is shown in fig .  3 , left panel .",
    "it is evident , that the two detected periods are independent , insofar as the changes in their amplitudes are completely uncorrelated .",
    "for all of the above reasons , it seems clear that these periods originate from different stars .",
    "the pixel size of kepler is 4@xmath5 and the photometric aperture for each target is substantially larger .",
    "we checked the fields of the objects having two or more short periods using the public ukirt j - band images and , in a few cases , images obtained with adaptive optics on the keck telescope . in the right panel of fig .  3",
    ", the keck image of kic  8416220 shows dramatically there are two stars separated by only about 0.3@xmath5 .    in all , we find imaging evidence for the binary or multiple nature of at least 1/3 of the 54 k and m stars which exhibit two or more short rotation periods of less than 2 days .",
    "we find separations of a few tenths to a few arcseconds .",
    "note that a separation of 1@xmath5 at a distance of 200 pc implies a 200 au physical separation , well within the expected range of bound binary separations ( 0.01 - @xmath6 au ) .",
    "supposing a roughly uniform stellar density in the _ kepler _ field , we estimated the probability of interlopers at different @xmath7 magnitudes , and found that the chance alignment of the stars which we find to be multiple , is at most a few percent ( see @xcite for details ) .      among the studied k dwarf stars , we found 7 objects each with one long period ( @xmath07 - 14 d ) and two short periods ( @xmath4 d ) .",
    "one of those is kic  3648000 which we present here in some detail .",
    "the left panels of fig .  4 show the high - amplitude variations due to the long period ( at @xmath012.5 d ) during two well - separated time segments .",
    "the corresponding time - frequency behaviour of the periods is given in fig .",
    "5 . in the left panel",
    "we see that the 12.5-day period is quite variable in time .",
    "the right panel indicates that the two short periods are independent of each other , having unrelated amplitude changes in time . in the right panels of fig .  4 the two different short period variations are seen as low - amplitude waves superimposed on the 12.5-day periodicity .",
    "however , the ukirt j - band image show no evidence of a double or multiple star system , which indicates that the separation of the anticipated binary pair ( if present ) must be less than 1@xmath5 .",
    "the reason for the rapid rotation could be the youth of the stars . @xcite found a trend that stars of spectral type f or earlier rotate faster on average than the later type ones . in late type",
    "dwarfs with convective envelopes strong magnetic fields exist which , through magnetic braking , slow down the rotation .",
    "this indicates that our rapidly rotating stars could be young .",
    "we find that about 5% of the m dwarfs and 2% of the k dwarfs rotate with periods shorter than 2 days . a model of the spin evolution of such stars shows , in good accord with our finding , that m dwarfs may spend about 4% of their lifetime having fast rotations of less than 2 days @xcite .",
    "@xmath8 m and k dwarf stars with two or more short periods ( differing by more than a few percent ) are likely bound , binary or hierarchical triple systems .",
    "+ @xmath8 so far we have found 37 such m stars and 17 k stars with two or more short periods .",
    "+ @xmath8 this is a novel way of discovering young , hierarchical m and k star systems .",
    "+ @xmath8 we found that @xmath05% ( 2% ) of all m ( k ) stars have short rotation periods of < 2 days .",
    "+ @xmath8 these fractions could be consistent with the amount of time that an m or k star spends at short rotation periods .",
