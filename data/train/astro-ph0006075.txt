    "the crab pulsar ( psr j0534 + 2200 = psr b0531@xmath421 ) was the first pulsating radio source identified at optical wavelengths ( cocke , disney , &  taylor 1969 ; lynds , maran , &  trumbo 1969 ) .",
    "most subsequent studies concentrated on the pulse shape in various photometric bands ( percival et al .",
    "1993 ; eikenberry et al .  1996",
    "; perryman et al .  1999 ; lundqvist et al .  1999 ) .",
    "they generally suggested small color variations in the light curve .",
    "no spectroscopic data existed until nasuti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) obtained the first optical spectrum .",
    "they were able to measure the general flux distribution as well as hint to an unidentified intrinsic absorption feature at 5920   .",
    "their spectrum is phase averaged , so no information on spectral variation with pulse phase can be extracted .    here",
    "we present the first flux - calibrated optical spectrum , separately for the main - pulse , the inter - pulse and the off - pulse components .",
    "the spectra of both pulses are compared with phase - resolved photometric studies . except for a very small ( @xmath5% ) contribution from the pulsar ( golden et al .",
    "2000 ) , the off - pulse spectrum , also presented here , corresponds to the nebular emission along the line of sight of the pulsar .",
    "observations were obtained with the lfosc spectrograph at the 2.12 m telescope of the observatorio astrofsico guillermo haro in cananea , mexico .",
    "the useful wavelength range was @xmath6    and the spectral resolution was @xmath7   .",
    "the slit of 2 arcsec width was kept in the n ",
    "s direction .",
    "the light entered the spectroscope through a frequency and phase controlled chopper .",
    "the device , described by ade &   galii ( 1996 ) , was used before on the same telescope to study the optical light curve of the pulsar .",
    "a blade allows light to enter the spectrograph for 10%  of each pulse period .",
    "this collection window is synchronized with the pulsar and kept on the desired pulse phase interval .",
    "we use the most recent of the jodrell - bank monthly crab ephemerides , translated from the solar - system barycentre , including real - time corrections for the earth orbital motion .",
    "long photometric observations confirmed that the difference between the pulsar and the chopper phase remains within @xmath8 for at least 3 hours ( ade et al .",
    "however the initial chopper ",
    "pulsar phase is set by maximizing the apparent magnitude of the pulsar , so that the absolute phase is only accurate to 0.03 ( galii 1999 ) .",
    "observations were obtained on dec 13 and dec 14 1998 and on oct 18 and oct 20 1999 under nearly photometric conditions and @xmath9 seeing . a total accumulated exposure on the main - pulse and",
    "the inter - pulse was 11700  sec and 9000  sec , while the total off - pulse observing time was 10200  sec .",
    "the off - pulse interval was chosen @xmath10 in phase after the main - pulse .",
    "several direct images of the pulsar field were obtained in order to control the atmosphere transparency and phase of the pulsar .",
    "the wavelength calibration is generally good to 2    and somewhat deteriorating at the blue end .",
    "the flux calibration , obtained through several exposures of the star eg50 and hiltner  600 , is accurate to 5%  in both color and absolute fluxes .",
    "all spectra were obtained between airmasses 1.01 and 1.3 .",
    "the pulsar spectra were de - reddened assuming @xmath11 ( percival et al .  1993 ) and @xmath12 which follows the average galactic extinction curve ( savage &  mathis 1979 ) to better than 1%   for @xmath13 .",
    "lrr & @xmath14 & @xmath15 + main - pulse & @xmath16 & @xmath17 + inter - pulse & @xmath18 & @xmath17 + underlying nebula & @xmath19 & @xmath20 +    spectra were reduced with standard iraf routines used according to our particular purpose .",
    "first , all the spectra were aligned with respect to the tracing of the pulsar and of another star 11.4 arcsec south of the pulsar . in order to achieve an optimal flux calibration ,",
    "a relatively wide aperture of 7 arcsec was used that included all pulsar - related flux and allowed for any wavelength variations of the focus of the spectrograph .",
    "all individual spectra were flux - calibrated but no nebular background was subtracted at this stage .",
    "the un - pulsed light was subtracted subsequently by subtracting the off - pulse flux - calibrated spectrum obtained just before or after .",
    "this technique makes an assumption - free subtraction of any nebular light , scattered light or telluric contributions .",
    "the chopper effectively enables us to take the pulsar off the sky and subtract the nebula emission at the exact pulsar s position .",
    "this is important as the nebular emission is varying on arcsec scale ( cf .",
    "section [ secnebula ] ) .",
    "the flux - calibrated de - reddened spectra of the main - pulse and inter - pulse are presented in the upper panel of fig .  1 .",

    "the lines are generally well - separated into approaching and receding components ( fig .",

    "component velocities , given in table [ tab ] , remain constant ( to within 200 km / s ) up to @xmath40  arcsec from the pulsar .",
    "all lines show similar velocity shifts , @xmath41 , except for the very strong receding component of [ o  iii ] 4959 and 5007 lines , receding at double velocity .",
    "the intensity of blue and red components is highly spatially variable and uncorrelated ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "a simple interpretation is that of an expanding shell , proposed already by davidson ( 1979 ) .",
    "the receding components of forbidden nebular lines show a wide pronounced peak @xmath42  arcsec north of the pulsar .",
    "the slope of the condensation , however , extends well behind the pulsar itself .",
    "the approaching components are generally weaker and show a condensation @xmath43  arcsec south of the pulsar .",
    "the kinematics and strength of h@xmath15 is similar to that of forbidden lines , but a pronounced receding component to the north of the pulsar is missing .",
    "the main result of this work is the flux calibrated time resolved spectrum of the crab pulsar .",
    "it shows no intrinsic spectral lines with the continuum following a power law with @xmath0 .",
    "the spectra of the main - pulse and the inter - pulse are identical : flux of the main - pulse multiplied by 0.32 equals that of the inter - pulse ( fig .  4 ) , where the formal upper limit to the difference in the power law index for the main- and the inter - pulse is 0.01 ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the above value of @xmath15 refers to de - reddened main- and inter - pulse spectra with nebular spectra subtracted at the exact area of pulsar s psf .",
    "this crucial subtraction was made possible by the dedicated chopper device that effectively enabled us to take the pulsar off the sky .",
    "the underlying nebula is redder ( @xmath1 ) and of varying intensity .",
    "we expect that this fact may explain why the power law index for the pulsar spectrum reported in the literature is slightly redder than deduced here .",
    "nasuti et al .",
    "( 1996 ) find @xmath45 in optical .",
    "gull et al .",
    "( 1998 ) give @xmath46 ( if @xmath47 is assumed ) in the uv . without the possibility of directly subtracting the off - pulse spectrum",
    ", one must make a model for the surrounding nebula .",
    "we simulated such modeling and took in an example the nebular spectrum 4 arcsec north and south from the pulsar as the background .",
    "this led to the derived value of @xmath48 in very good seeing ( fwhm @xmath49 arcsec ) or even 0.0 in more mediocre conditions .",
    "we also note that errors below 0.1 in @xmath15 appear unrealistic , as they imply a color calibration accurate to better than 7%  a goal difficult to achieve on a patchy nebular background and given the uncertainties in the extinction law .",
    "we detected no color variation in the pulsed light .",
    "photometric investigation of eikenberry et al .",
    "( 1996 ) reports slight color variation on pulse slopes .",
    "note , however , that our observations were obtained close to the centers of the main- and inter - pulse .",
    "so the two studies are somewhat difficult to compare : we present flux - calibrated spectra with slightly uncertain absolute phase , while eikenberry et al",
    ".  have an excellent phase definition but lack absolute color calibration .",
    "romani et al .",
    "( 1999 ) report on a relative decrease of the main pulse flux in the ir ( @xmath50 m  @xmath51 m ) with respect to the optical ( @xmath52 m  @xmath53 m ) .",
    "we can not confirm a similar trend in our optical spectra , even if the braking of the power law beyond 800  nm could possibly be interpreted in this way . since the nebular spectrum has a similar break , we would like another independent confirmation .",
    "a phase resolved spectrum of the crab was presented by perryman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in agreement with our results they detected no color dependence of the pulse shape in the optical .",
    "note however that a limited resolution ( @xmath54 ) and performance of the otherwise promising stj junction detectors  together with modest seeing  prevented them from flux calibrating their spectrum and subtracting the nebular contributions .    by perfecting the stroboscopic technique",
    "we were able to obtain the spectrum of the pulsed emission of the crab pulsar on a medium size telescope .",
    "we are now using the same technique to identify optical counterparts of known radio pulsars .",
