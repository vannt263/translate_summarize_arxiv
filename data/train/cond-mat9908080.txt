    "the phases of flux lines ( fls ) in high temperature superconductors are the subject of many current experimental and theoretical investigations @xcite . in the classical ( abrikosov )",
    "picture of type - ii superconductors , fls penetrate a clean material for fields @xmath1 , to form a triangular solid lattice .",
    "this mean field phase diagram is modified by inclusion of the strong thermal fluctuations and play an important role in high-@xmath2 materials @xcite .",
    "the presence of various forms of disorder ( such as point or columnar disorder ) , also affects on the mean field phase diagram . in this paper",
    "we typically focus on the phase diagram of the pure materials , however , there are many interesting experimental and theoretical works describing the effect of both thermal fluctuations and disorder on the phase diagram @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the thermal fluctuations lead to melting of the vortex lattice and appearance of a vortex liquid .",
    "it has now become possible to observe the melting transition experimentally .",
    "the indirect observations @xcite based on the resistivity measurements , and recent experiments @xcite based on the measuring a jump in the magnetization or the latent heat show a first - order vortex lattice melting transition . on the other hand ,",
    "vortex lattice melting has been studied theoretically using various approximations .",
    "early works using the renormalization group @xcite or density functional theory @xcite have indicated a first - order transition .",
    "elastic theory combined with the lindemann criterion produce a melting line in good agreement with the experimental observations @xcite .",
    "there are also a large interest in numerical simulations for studying this problem .",
    "an interesting work in this direction is done by nordborg and blatter @xcite which present an extensive numerical study of the vortex matter using the mapping to 2d bosons and path - integral monte carlo simulations .",
    "it was suggested by nelson that the vortex system is equivalent to a system of interacting bosons in two dimensions ( bose model ) @xcite .",
    "this mapping predicts a melting transition into an entangled vortex liquid .",
    "therefore , the problem of a vortex system maps to a system of @xmath3 bosons in two dimensions interacting through the potential @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the modified bessel function , @xmath6 is the london penetration depth , and @xmath7 is a constant that scales the energy of interaction . in the language of the vortices",
    ", this potential comes from the interaction between vortices in the london theory , and @xmath8 is related to the elastic moduli of the vortex lattice .",
    "the bose model differs from the real vortex system ( see next section ) , however it still contains the main part of the interaction @xcite .",
    "hence , it would be reasonable and interesting to use this model for describing the properties of the vortex phase diagram .",
    "more recently @xcite , the bose model has been used in a numerical study of the vortex matter .",
    "some physical quantities such as structure factor and superfluid density in different temperatures are given addressed , and the first order vortex lattice melting transition into an entangled vortex liquid is approved by numerical simulations . in the language of the boson system , this transition is related to the quantum phase transition from a wigner crystal to a superfluid .",
    "the bose model idea also allows for using the many body techniques . in this work",
    ", we apply the self - consistent - field approximation of singwi , tosi , land , and sjolander ( stls ) @xcite , and calculate the static structure factor , pair correlation function , interaction energy and the spectrum of the excited energies for different magnetic field strengths and temperatures .",
    "the stls approximation has originally been proposed for describing a degenerate electron gas and has been used successfully to study a variety of other systems too @xcite . in the stls theory ,",
    "the correlation effects are incorporated through a static local - field correction , which is obtained numerically in a self - consistent way .",
    "we find numerical results for the static structure factor @xmath9 over a wide range of the parameters . from the calculation of @xmath9 , we present the results for the pair correlation function , the interaction energy and spectrum of the excited energies .",
    "different behaviors of these quantities may be used for studying the phases of vortex lines .",
    "it is well known that the oscillatory behavior in @xmath10 is a signature of the solid phase .",
    "therefore , the phase transition can be detected by looking at the behavior of the @xmath10 in a fixed temperature ( magnetic field ) but varying magnetic field ( temperature ) .",
    "the solid - liquid transition can also be observed using the static structure factor .",
    "disappearing of the peaks in the structure factor resembles the onset of the phase transition .",
    "hence , using the behaviors of the pair correlation function and static structure factor , the phase diagram can be explained qualitatively , however , it is not possible to determine precisely the melting transition temperature .",
    "one of the transition signatures is the appearance of a special @xmath11 on which the spectrum of the excited energies vanishes .",
    "so we have numerically investigated the dispersion relation of the excited energies as a good quantity for the estimation of the @xmath0 phase diagram and the melting temperature .",
    "quantitatively our results for the excited energies are compatible with the expected results of the phase diagram @xcite and recent monte carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the direction dependent interaction for real vortices has very interesting consequences and predicts a van der waals interaction even for straight vortices @xcite .",
    "it is shown @xcite that in the decoupled limit , @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the anisotropy parameter ) , the van der waals attraction is proportional to @xmath14 .",
    "this attractive interaction with entropic repulsion has very important outcomes for the low - field phase diagram of the anisotropic superconductors @xcite .",
    "recently volmer and schwartz @xcite introduced a new variational approach to consider the effects of van der waals attraction and repulsive interaction on the field phase diagram .",
    "we also consider the same model in the stls approximation for studying the combined effects of the repulsive and attractive potentials on the solid and liquid phases of the pure anisotropic or layered superconductors .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we shortly review the bose model and discuss its applicability to the vortex system .",
    "the stls approximation is briefly discussed in sec .",
    "the numerical results for the repulsion interaction is presented and discussed in the sec .",
    "the results for the van der waals interaction and its consequences in the phase diagram is given in sec .",
    "v , and finally the conclusions appear in sec .  vi .",
    "in the feynman path - integral picture @xcite , the system of @xmath3 interacting bosons in two dimensions is described by the action @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a two dimensional vector representing the positions of the bosons , and @xmath17 is the temperature of the system . in the schrodinger picture",
    "the above action is equivalent to the two - dimensional schrodinger equation , @xmath18\\psi_0=e_0\\psi_0,\\ ] ] where the potential @xmath19 is proportional to the modified bessel function .",
    "it was pointed out by nelson @xcite that the above action can be also interpreted as the london free energy for a system of vortex lines .",
    "the london free energy for a system of interacting vortices for a sample of length @xmath20 is given by , @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the quantum flux , @xmath25 is coherence length , and @xmath26 is the lattice spacing . comparing this functional free energy , which is referred as bose model for the vortex system , with the action ( [ actions ] )",
    "shows the relationship between the parameters of the 2d bosons and vortices .",
    "the modified bessel function @xmath27 describes a screened logarithmic interaction , @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the london penetration depth defines the interaction range .",
    "note that according to the two - fluid model @xcite , the penetration depth diverges at zero - field transition temperature @xmath2 , and therefore the interaction range becomes considerably longer upon approaching @xmath2 .    as it is discussed in details in the ref .",
    "@xcite , in spite of the fact that the bose model differs from the real vortex system in the choice of boundary conditions , the linearalization leading to the elastic term , and the retarded interaction , contain the main parts of the interaction between vortices and one expects that the results be in a rough quantitative agreement with those of real systems .",
    "in this section we shortly review the principal equations of the stls approximation @xcite .",
    "these equations show the relation between the response function , static structure factor , and the local field correction .    in the stls approximation , the response function can be expressed as @xcite , @xmath32}.\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath33",

    "( [ resf ] ) , leading to @xmath50    in the next section , we present numerical results for various quantities of interest .",
    "in this section we present the results of the numerical calculations for the interesting physical quantities .",

    "one of our numerical results which was developed by iterating the eqs .",
    "( [ lfc ] ) and  ( [ s2 ] ) is the behavior of the static structure factor which is shown in fig .  1 for a fixed @xmath60 ( @xmath61(tesla ) ) and different @xmath51 s ( temperatures ) .    [ fig1 ] = 8truecm    fig .",
    "1 manifests the very expected behavior of the static structure factor , that is the peak of the @xmath9 is decreased by increasing @xmath17 ( decreasing @xmath51 ) .",
    "disappearing of the peak in the @xmath9 by increasing the temperature shows that the system undergoes a phase transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase .",
    "we can also see the melting transition by fixing the temperature and increasing the magnetic field .",
    "choosing @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , we have found the @xmath9 for different values of @xmath52 , see fig .  2 .",
    "[ fig2 ] = 8truecm    the amplitude of the peaks becomes smaller with decreasing the @xmath52 , while it disappears for high magnetic fields .",
    "so we will have the same scenario for describing the phase transition .",
    "the melting transition of the vortex lattice can also be discussed by studying the behavior of the pair correlation function .",
    "it is seen that the results of @xmath9 can be used for calculating the @xmath10 defined in the eqn .",

    "3 shows that the pair correlation function has oscillatory behavior for low temperatures , however , its amplitude becomes shorter by increasing the temperature , and disappears for very high temperatures .",
    "the oscillatory behavior is a signature of the solid phase , therefore , the system is going to have a transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase by increasing the temperature .",
    "we have also determined the interaction energy of the system using the eqn .",

    "we observe that the numerical results show that the interaction energy increases by decreasing the strength of magnetic field .",
    "the results of the pair correlation function and static structure factor are in good qualitative agreement with the expected results of the phase diagram of the vortex system . however , for obtaining some quantitative description , we use the spectrum of the excited energy of the system .",

    "but for varying temperatures , the following graph resembles that @xmath68 tends to a zero value for a finite @xmath11 .",
    "the appearance of minimum in @xmath68 is in correspondence with the fact that @xmath37 becomes greater than one for some ranges of @xmath51 .",
    "[ fig4 ] = 8truecm    the zero value of the dispersion relation indicate that the system undergoes a phase transition at that point . because of numerical restrictions we are not able to find the exact value of the point where @xmath68 becomes zero .",
    "however , we have realized by our numerical experience that when we are close to the transition point the @xmath11 value of the minimum @xmath68 and the local field correction @xmath37 are not highly sensitive to the variations of @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , at least for determining the transition temperature we have ignored their dependence to @xmath51 in the eqn .",
    "( [ omegaq ] ) .",
    "so we fixed the magnetic field and found the temperature that @xmath68 becomes zero .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 phase diagram is plotted in the fig .",

    "taking into account the direction dependent interaction for real vortices give rise to interesting results and predicts a van der waals ( vdw ) interaction even for straight vortices @xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to consider the superposition of the short range attractive and the long range repulsive interactions and study its consequence for the low - field phase diagram of the anisotropic superconductors .",
    "it is shown @xcite that in the decoupled limit , @xmath71 , the interaction potential is given by @xmath72 where , @xmath73 measures the amplitude of the direct interaction between flux lines , and @xmath74 determines the strength of the thermal vdw attraction .",

    "[ fig6 ] = 8truecm    the results show that the importance of the vdw interaction with high magnetic field is valid only for the temperature close to the transition .",
    "one should note that the vdw interaction has very important consequences for low magnetic fields and temperatures .",
    "however , in our approach it is not possible to consider this case , and one has to use some other approximations or monte carlo simulations for seeing these effects .",
    "in this paper we studied the bose model in stls approximation .",
    "we found the static structure factor , pair correlation function , interaction energy and spectrum of the excited energies for different values of the mass ( temperature ) and the density ( magnetic field ) .",
    "we discussed that how the results may be applied for the vortex matter phase diagram . if one fixes the magnetic field ( temperature ) and calculate @xmath9 for different temperatures ( magnetic field ) , the gradual disappearance of the peaks in @xmath9 manifests the existence of the phase transition .",
    "one can also use the pair correlation function for describing the melting transition .",
    "we showed that the changing behavior of @xmath10 from oscillatory to a rather smooth one can be explored within our numerical scheme so that the hallmark of the transition from solid phase to the liquid phase can be observed .",
    "the results were in good qualitative agreement with the phase diagram of the fls .",
    "for estimation of the @xmath0 phase diagram quantitatively , we invoke to the behavior of the excited energy spectrum , from which the resulting phase diagram supports the expected results of the high temperature superconductors and monte carlo simulation quite well",
    ".    we also added the van der waals attractive potential and studied the effect of both repulsive and attractive potentials in the phase diagram .",
    "the results indicate that the vdw interaction for high magnetic field is only important for the temperatures close to the melting temperature .",
    "we emphasis that our approach does nt work for the low magnetic fields and hence , it would be interesting to use some other methods and determine the effects of both repulsive and attractive potentials in the low magnetic fields and temperatures .    to our knowledge",
    "this is the first time that the stls approximation is applied for studying the vortex system , and our work show that stls approximation is applicable for studying other aspects of the vortex systems and it might help to reveal some unknown properties in further investigations .    we have benefited from useful discussion with r. asgari , j. davoudi and m. kardar .",
