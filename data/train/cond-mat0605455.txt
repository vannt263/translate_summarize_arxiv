    "in recent years increased interests in various networks realizations @xcite revealed that several new types of graphs termed _ structured graphs _",
    "are more appropriate mathematical objects to describe complex network s geometry than traditional _ random graphs _",
    "the variety of structures was found to emerge through evolution processes in which nodes and links are added sequentially according to specified rules , in particular , the preferential attachment rules lead to strongly inhomogeneous _ scale - free graphs _ @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the evolving networks , which comprise a class of _ causal _ graphs , the class of _ homogeneous _ graphs consists of graphs with fixed number of nodes and fluctuating or rewiring links according to given rules or certain optimization processes .",
    "complex graph structures may emerge in this procedures , especially when certain global or local optimization constraints are imposed @xcite .",
    "planar graphs are special class of graphs that can be embedded in a euclidean plane .",
    "a graph is planar _ iff it does not contain a subdivision of @xmath1 ( 5-clique ) and @xmath2 ( minimal non - planar graph with 6 nodes ) _ @xcite . consequently , planar graphs fulfill euler s law : @xmath3 , which is relating the number of nodes @xmath4 , links @xmath5 and polygons @xmath6 .    in this work",
    "we suggest a new method for growing a planar cellular graph by attachment of objects  cells ( polygons ) of length @xmath7 , which are chosen from a given distribution @xmath8 .",
    "the polygons are added sequentially in time starting from an initial polygon .",
    "in addition , we strictly impose the constraint on number of links per node @xmath9 , which is thus fulfilled everywhere in the interior of the graph and on some nodes on the graph boundary .",
    "the attachment of cells is controlled by two parameters  the width of the distribution of cell sizes @xmath10 and the parameter @xmath11 that plays the role of chemical potential of cell aggregation . in the limit of vanishing attachment potential @xmath12 the growth process",
    "resembles the one in diffusion - limited aggregation @xcite .",
    "however , aggregated are spatially extended cells of particles rather than single particles .",
    "emergent structures of cellular networks are resembling of soap froths @xcite or patterns of nano - particles self - assembled through nonlinear dynamic processes @xcite .",
    "typically , a pattern of cells appears when nano - particles are immersed in a liquid film , which is then allowed to evaporate until holes of different sizes open - up leaving particles in the walls between the holes @xcite .",
    "generally , the structure of the patterns effects the physical processes on them , such as current transport @xcite . it is therefore important to understand the topology of the aggregated cellular networks in detail . here",
    "we study the topological properties , such as shortest paths between nodes , topological centrality , and fractality of the graph s perimeter in different cellular networks obtained by varying the control parameters of the aggregation processes .",
    "the basic idea is to make growing model of planar graph with given distribution of cell ( polygon ) sizes @xmath8 and with degree of nodes @xmath13 .",
    "for this purpose we observe some topological constraints on the distribution of cell sizes : ( i ) @xmath8 is defined for @xmath14 , for non - clustered graph we fix @xmath15 ; ( ii ) planar graph obeys euler s law : @xmath3 . among these the homogeneous plane - filling structures",
    "are of special interest @xcite . for this class of graphs majority of nodes",
    "are in the interior of the graph , ie . , nodes with degree @xmath9 .",
    "therefor @xmath16 and euler s law becomes @xmath17 for large system with distribution of cell sizes @xmath8 we have @xmath18 substituting second relation into ( [ euler1 ] ) : @xmath19 , then for large @xmath20 one can find that the average cell size is equal to six @xmath21    we use lognormal distribution of polygon size @xmath22 which is most often found in experiments @xcite . using the condition ( [ tc ] ) the number of independent parameters in ( [ lnormal ] ) is reduced @xmath23 where second central moment @xmath10 remains as the control parameter in our case .",
    "starting from an initial cell , at each time step a new cell with size taken from the distribution @xmath8 is attached to the graph boundary of the graph according to the following rules :    1 .   in the aggregation only nodes with degree 3 can be closed inside the graph ; 2 .",
    "new link can be assigned only to nodes with degree 2 ; 3 .",
    "potential nesting place is searched as an array of nodes on graph boundary with degree 3 limited with two nodes of degree 2 .",
    "the nested part of the cell is identified with the nodes of the nesting string . therefore , number of extra nodes to be added is @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is length of the nesting string .",
    "we select the nesting place with probability @xmath26 , where the parameter @xmath11 plays the role of the chemical potential for addition of new nodes .",
