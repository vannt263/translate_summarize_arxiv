    "we also find the evolution of the @xmath14 dependence with temperature , and find conditions at which thermal fluctuations do not mask the quantum effects .",
    "it may seem that within the framework of the constant interaction model employed here and in the limit of small mean level spacing in the grain the shape of the coulomb blockade staircase in the s - i - n case should not differ from that for the n - i - s system studied in ref .  .",
