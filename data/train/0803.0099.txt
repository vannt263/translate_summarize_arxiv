    "hydrodynamics of complex fluids are of particular importance in various science and engineering fields , such as fluid mechanics , soft matter science , mechanical engineering , chemical engineering , and so on . because of the complicated couplings between internal degree of freedoms of complex fluids and their flow behavior , conventional treatments , based on usual assumptions such as non - slip boundary conditions and linear newtonian constitutive relations , are often invalid .",
    "striking examples can be seen in systems such as colloidal dispersions , polymeric liquids , granular matters , and liquid crystals .",
    "those systems are known to exhibit peculiar flow behaviors , e.g. , shear thinning or thickening , viscoelasticity , jamming , flow induced phase transition , etc .    although there exits huge accumulation of experimental and theoretical studies on the rheology of complex fluids , performing computational fluid dynamics ( cfd ) simulations are not yet common for complex fluids since reliable constitutive equations are often unknown for those systems . on the other hand , there exists a different problem also for microscopic approaches such as molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , while constitutive equations are no more necessary in this case . the characteristic time and",
    "length scales of complex fluids easily become several orders larger than those of microscopic scales . therefore , most hydrodynamic problems of complex fluids are yet out of reach of microscopic md simulations . to overcome those serious limitations mentioned above",
    ", we aim to develop a new multi - scale method which is for performing hybrid simulations of md and cfd valid for complex fluids without any constitutive equations .",
    "various methods for hybrid simulations of md and cfd has already been proposed by several researchers .",
    "most of those methods are based on `` domain decomposition '' for which md simulations are applied only around the points of interest , _",
    "i.e. _ , in the vicinity of defects , boundaries , interfaces , where details of molecular motions are important , while the remaining regions are treated only by cfd .",
    "@xcite exchange of information between md and cfd is performed in a coupling regions where each system is subjected to some constrains to take the consistency of the two systems .",
    "this kind of hybrid method is expected to be useful specially for problems including interfaces , such as adhesion , friction , anchoring of crystal liquids , stick - slip motions , etc .    in order to apply hybrid methods of md and cfd to hydrodynamics of complex fluids , a different type of approach",
    "is probably needed .",
    "our strategy for this is straightforward .",
    "we try to develop a multi - scale hybrid method based on the local equilibrium assumption . here",
    "cfd is used as a fluid solver , while md simulations are used only to generate local properties , such as constitutive relations of the fluid under consideration , by performing local statistical sampling in a consistent matter .",
    "the numerical algorithm is rather simple .",
    "we perform usual lattice - mesh based cfd simulations at an upper level , but each mesh - node is associated with a small lower level md cell which passes a `` local stress '' to cfd according to a `` local flow field '' given from cfd to md instead of using any constitutive functions at cfd level .",
    "md simulations thus have to be performed at all node points and at every time steps of cfd .",
    "one might think that the simulations would be be much faster if we construct tabular database of the constitutive relations by performing md simulations in advance under many different simulation parameters and refer the table from cfd .",
    "the `` tabular approach '' works much effective for simple fluids for which the constitutive relations depend only on a few parameters , such as the density , temperature , and shear rate . in the case of complex fluids , however , the number of parameters to be considered can be huge depending on the local quantities to be considered . in the case of charged systems for example , the local stress depends also on the local compositions and chemical potentials of ions and the local electric field , etc .",
    "although we used only simple lennard - jones liquid in the present study , we adopt the local sampling strategy rather than the tabular contraction strategy to be more general .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to examine the validity of our multi - scale hybrid model by performing some simple demonstrations of the method .",
    "efficiency and drawback of both strategies will be considered in future for more specific problems .",
    "an idea similar in spirit to the present method was also put forward earlier by w. ren and w. e. @xcite    the hybrid simulation method is described in sec .",
    "ii , and some demonstrative results for one- and two - dimensional flows of simple lennard - jones liquids are shown in sec .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that our hybrid simulations successfully reproduced the correct flow behavior obtained from usual cfds as far as the mesh size @xmath0 and the time - step @xmath1 of cfd are not too large comparing to the system size @xmath2 and the sampling duration @xmath3 of md simulations performed at each time step of cfds . </S>",
