    "symmetry under spatial transformations is a simple yet fundamental concept underlying the description of most systems in contemporary physics as the origin of conserved quantities . in quantum theory and wave",
    "mechanics , symmetry - induced conservation laws are extended from continuous to discrete transformations in terms of commutation of the corresponding operators with the hamiltonian , which in turn dictates the spatial structure of stationary states .",
    "ubiquitous paradigms are reflection ( @xmath0 ) or finite translation ( @xmath1 ) symmetry imposing definite parity or bloch momentum on hamiltonian eigenstates , which then provide the basis for understanding phenomena such as selection rules of level transitions in atoms @xcite or the formation of band structure in crystals @xcite . in intricate lattice systems of intense current interest such as topological insulators @xcite , weyl semimetals @xcite , and lieb lattices @xcite ,",
    "state localization and transport properties are also predominantly traced back to broken or unbroken spatial symmetries in combination with the operation of time reversal ( @xmath2 ) . the significance of broken spatiotemporal symmetries and has further been addressed for driven quantum systems @xcite in relation to directional transport @xcite .",
    "since symmetries are naturally addressed with respect to commutation with the global system hamiltonian , they are usually regarded dichotomously as broken or unbroken .",
    "nevertheless , in a composite system the hamiltonian elements may retain a certain spatial symmetry _ locally _ in a subdomain of configuration space although it is broken _ globally _ ; we refer to this case as a ` local symmetry ' ( ls ) .",
    "although there is clearly a remnant of the considered symmetry in the corresponding subsystem , it is not evident how to track this information in the eigenstates of the hamiltonian since it generally does not commute with the ls operation . at the same time , lss are actually inherently paramount to a variety of systems such as aperiodic lattices with long - range order @xcite , partially disordered media @xcite , and single complex molecules @xcite",
    ". a typical example are also generic solid state nanostructures @xcite where unavoidable impurities and defects ( usually modeled as @xmath0-symmetric ) separate the host crystal into finite @xmath1-symmetric parts .",
    "ls may also be present by design in artificial devices like , e.g. , multilayered photonic setups @xcite , acoustic waveguides @xcite , or magnonic systems @xcite , due to restrictions of finiteness or functionality .",
    "in fact , even global spatial symmetry is generally rendered local as soon as a system s immediate environment is included in the description .",
    "the spatial structure of stationary states in continuous , one - dimensional ( 1d ) , locally symmetric scattering potentials was recently pinpointed within the framework of symmetry - adapted nonlocal currents ( nlcs ) @xcite : at any real frequency , two distinct nlcs are spatially constant within subdomains of local @xmath0 or @xmath1 symmetry .",
    "they provide a mapping of field amplitudes between ls related points , thus generalizing the mapping through parity or bloch factors for global symmetry @xcite .",
    "the nlcs were further linked to perfectly transmitting states @xcite and proposed as a natural order parameter for spontaneous symmetry breaking in non - hermitian @xmath3-symmetric systems @xcite , as well as observed experimentally in lossy acoustic setups @xcite .",
    "the stationary translational invariance of the nlcs suggests that they are governed by a continuity equation incorporating the associated symmetry transform . in the case of global space reflection",
    "@xmath0 , a continuous two - point version of the quantum current density is intricately related to the combination of @xmath0 with the operation of time reversal @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "a similar bilocal picture of quantum mechanics has also been used in an alternative description of double slit interference @xcite .",
    "conservation of the two - point current in 1d continuous @xmath3-symmetric systems can be derived from schrdinger s @xcite , or via gauge invariance of a nonlocal lagrangian @xcite in analogy to local current conservation .",
    "global @xmath3 symmetry has gained increased attention since it admits real discrete spectrum for non - hermitian systems @xcite in parametric regions where density loss and gain are balanced @xcite , and has been intensively investigated in wave scattering @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian hamiltonians are of particular interest in discrete models , where the coupling between sites constitutes an additional degree of freedom for design and control @xcite . a reliable platform of applicability is provided by photonic waveguide arrays which are well described by an effective discrete schrdinger equation with tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "discrete arrays are ideal for implementing global or local spatial symmetries , by adjusting the onsite hamiltonian elements or the inter - site hoppings , to study their impact on field state properties . as an example , in a certain class of discrete structures with ` hidden ' symmetries in the state space @xcite , conserved quantities from global operators commuting with the hamiltonian can be identified .",
    "partial @xmath3 symmetry along a given coordinate has also been implemented in the form of dimer arrays featuring synchronous bloch - zener oscillations @xcite or synthetic lattices with solitonic excitations @xcite . in discrete models ,",
    "even the local current becomes a two - point quantity , naturally defined to flow on the ` link ' between two lattice sites @xcite .",
    "this raises the question of how to formulate discrete conservation laws for nonlocal quantities entailing different links . in view of ls ,",
    "such a framework would provide the relation between nonlocal link currents to general lattice symmetry transformations restricted to subdomains of a composite system .    in the present work",
    ", we combine the concept of local symmetry transformations with that of nonlocal current continuity for discrete  generally non - hermitian  schrdinger models .",
    "we thereby identify the breaking of lss as sources for the nlcs flowing along transformation related links .",
    "the nlcs are given in operator form , thus making the extension to multiple links per site straightforward .",
    "with photonic waveguide arrays in mind , we apply the framework to 1d tight - binding hermitian and non - hermitian lattice systems with local @xmath4 or @xmath5 symmetry , respectively , with @xmath6 ( inversion ) or @xmath1 ( finite translation ) .",
    "the evolution of the associated nonlocal charge is given in terms of the nlcs at the boundaries of locally symmetric domains , based on a symmetry - induced discrete gauss law .",
    "together with an alternatively defined nlc , identities are derived which relate the amplitudes of general states at symmetry - transformed sites and connect the nlcs with the local current . for stationary states ,",
    "the lss thereby induce amplitude mappings within finite domains .",
    "the domainwise translation invariance of the nlcs in stationary states is demonstrated for different types of ls , including their generalized analogue for periodically modulated arrays .",
    "it is thus demonstrated how the nlcs reveal the hamiltonian lss encoded in arbitrarily irregular eigenstates .",
    "finally , the density profile of perfectly transmitting scattering states is shown to be characterized by nlcs in terms of its ls .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in [ sec : transform ] we introduce the concept of lss in terms of the corresponding local permutation matrices and nonlocal site projection operators .",
    "section [ sec : discrete_continuity ] is devoted to the discrete nonlocal continuity and the relation of the nlcs and associated nonlocal charge to lss . in [ sec : stat_invariants_mappings ] we address the properties of nlcs in stationary states , derive the symmetry - induced amplitude mapping relations and the connection to the local current , and generalize the nlc to driven arrays . in [ sec : bound_eigenmodes ] we discuss the cases of complete , overlapping , and gapped ls , and provide examples of invariant nlcs in non - hermitian and driven finite arrays . in section [ sec : scattering ] we consider the nlcs in scattering states , derive their relation to perfect transmission and illustrate their invariance in locally symmetric non - hermitian scatterers . section [ sec : conclusions ] concludes the paper and provides perspectives for generalizations and future work .",
    "to define the concept and explicit form of a ls operation in a 1d discrete model , we start by considering a single - particle , time - independent hamiltonian @xmath7 represented on @xmath8 localized site excitations @xmath9 , @xmath10 , with onsite potential elements @xmath11 and hopping elements @xmath12 from site @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "the temporal evolution of a quantum state @xmath15 is then governed by the schrdinger equation ( se ) @xmath16 where we set @xmath17 .",
    "such a discrete model is widely used to describe coherent electron transport in 1d lattice potentials like the ones induced in quantum dot arrays , but also as a finite difference approximation to the continuous se by choosing appropriate ( typically equal ) hopping values .",
    "in particular , [ eq : schr ] effectively also describes light propagation in photonic waveguide arrays within the paraxial approximation @xcite for small lateral wave vector components .",
    "1d versions of such a photonic array are schematically depicted in [ fig : setup ] .",
    "time @xmath18 is here represented by the longitudinal spatial coordinate @xmath19 along the waveguides , and energy @xmath20 is accordingly represented by the light propagation constant along @xmath19 .",
    "onsite potentials @xmath21 correspond to the refractive indices of waveguides , while the hoppings @xmath22 are proportional to the overlap of the light field localized in waveguides @xmath23 and thereby mapped to their distance .",
    "remarkable agreement with experimental results is achieved already in the tight - binding approximation @xcite with @xmath24 for @xmath25 , which we will focus on in the following .",
    "given the above framework for a discrete 1d schrdinger model , we consider a bijective mapping @xmath26 given by @xmath27 which performs a local inversion ( @xmath0 ) through a center @xmath28 or translation ( @xmath1 ) by a length @xmath29 of sites @xmath30 to sites @xmath31 , where the domain @xmath32 is generally a subset of the total set @xmath33 of all sites .",
    "suppose now that the discrete system decribed by the hamiltonian elements @xmath34 remains invariant under this site mapping , that is , @xmath35 so that @xmath36 is a symmetry transformation of the system .",
    "we then say that the system possesses a _ local _ symmetry in the union @xmath37 .",
    "a ls is thus contrasted with a _",
    "global _ symmetry of the system for which @xmath38 .",
    "locally @xmath0- and @xmath1-symmetric photonic arrays are depicted in [ fig : setup](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "the discrete parameters @xmath28 and @xmath29 here refer to the site indexing and not to the continuous coordinate along the array : the center @xmath28 is integer ( half integer ) for odd ( even ) number of sites @xmath39 in @xmath40 , and the integer period @xmath29 is the shift in site number to the right .",
    "intersite distances in the physical system are mapped to corresponding hopping element magnitudes in the model , determined by evanescent field overlap between waveguides in photonics @xcite .",
    "thus , a local inversion maps a domain @xmath40 to itself , so that @xmath41 , while a local translation shifts @xmath40 by @xmath29 sites , so that @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the rightmost @xmath29 sites in @xmath44 ( see [ fig : setup ] ) for @xmath45 ( the case @xmath46 will be treated later in [ sec : symmetry_types ] ) .    )",
    "symmetric about a center @xmath28 or * ( b ) * translation ( @xmath1 ) symmetric with period @xmath29 , for sites @xmath47 within a domain @xmath40 ( solid blue line ) , together with the corresponding close - coupling hamiltonian matrix @xmath48 and local transformation ( site permutation ) matrix @xmath49 or @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 maps @xmath40 to itself , while @xmath50 performs a cyclic shift permutation by @xmath29 sites on @xmath51 , where @xmath52 ( solid purple line ) is the rightmost period in @xmath44 ( dotted blue line ) . ]    with the ( symmetry ) mapping @xmath36 transforming the site indices @xmath47 , we correspondingly define an operator @xmath53 which replaces the wave amplitude @xmath54 with @xmath55 for the basis ket @xmath9 when acting on a state @xmath56 ( cf .",
    "[ eq : psi ] ) , @xmath57 since the basis @xmath58 is assumed orthonormal ( @xmath59 ) , so that we can symbolically write the action as an amplitude mapping @xmath60 in analogy with the local _ site _ mapping in [ eq : fmapping ] for @xmath61 .",
    "the associated matrix @xmath62 has elements @xmath63_{mn } = \\braket{m|\\hat{\\varsigma}|n}$ ] given by @xmath64_{mn } = \\begin{cases } \\delta_{\\bar{m}n } , ~~&m \\in { \\mathbb{d}}\\\\ \\delta_{mn } , ~~&m \\in { \\mathbb{n}}\\setminus { \\mathbb{u}}\\end{cases } , ~~   { { \\varsigma}}_{\\mathbb{d}}= { { p}}_{\\mathbb{d}},{{k}}_{\\mathbb{d}}.\\ ] ] for local inversion , @xmath49 performs a ( partial ) mirror permutation of the sites within @xmath40 . for local translation , [ eq : sigma_matrix ]",
    "leaves the mapping of sites @xmath65 undefined , for which we explicitly choose @xmath63_{mn } = \\delta_{\\bar{m}-d , n}$ ] so that the last @xmath29 sites in @xmath44 are mapped to the first @xmath29 ones .",
    "the permutation matrix thus acts on the whole array but permutes only sites amplitudes within the domain @xmath44 where the ls of the system resides while leaving sites outside @xmath44 unchanged .",
    "note that multiple symmetry domains @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) may in general be present , with corresponding centers @xmath68 or periods @xmath69 .",
    "the total symmetry domain is then the ( generally disconnected ) set @xmath70 , with the mapping for each separate @xmath66 entering [ eq : sigma_matrix ] .",
    "different types of ls will be addressed in [ sec : symmetry_types ] .",
    "symmetry of a system under a transformation is usually associated with the commutation of the corresponding symmetry operator with the hamiltonian . in the case of global symmetry ,",
    "that is , @xmath38 in the present setting ( with @xmath71 implied for translation symmetry ) , the hamiltonian indeed commutes with the matrix @xmath62 and the energy eigenstates are also eigenstates of the symmetry operation with the corresponding eigenvalues : under inversion or translation",
    "the wave amplitudes are mapped to @xmath72 with the parity @xmath73 or the bloch phase @xmath74 ( @xmath75 being the quasimomentum ) as prefactors , respectively . in the case of a ls , although the system remains invariant under the site permutation , the associated operator generally does not commute with the hamiltonian , @xmath76 \\neq 0.\\ ] ] the reason is the change in connectivity of the domain @xmath40 to its surroundings : the end sites of @xmath40 in a 1d array are not coupled to the same sites after the local permutation , and so the transformed hamiltonian @xmath77 ( recall that @xmath78 for any permutation matrix ) generally contains altered nonzero hopping elements @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 ; cf . [ eq : hmn_local_ssym ] .",
    "the spatial structure of system eigenstates is therefore no longer dictated directly by the presence of symmetry as in the global case where the field magnitude @xmath82 has the @xmath83-symmetry of the potential .",
    "the inequivalence between _ system _ symmetry and commutation of the symmetry operation with the hamiltonian does not come as a surprise : a trivial example is a finite homogeneous tigh - binding array ( with @xmath84 ) which is obviously invariant under _ any _ arbitrary site permutation whose matrix , however , does not commute with @xmath48 ( except for mirror permutation ) , since it changes the intersite connections , as explained above .",
    "the question raised here is , nevertheless , if the presence of symmetries in the system are in some way imprinted on the structure of its states , even if those symmetries are not global but of finite extent .",
    "the aim is thus to find a characterization of the field amplitude configuration in terms of a quantity which follows the underlying lss of the system .",
    "to do so , in the following section we turn to the notion of nonlocal current - density continuity in its discrete form and adapt it to the ls framework .    before closing this section , we need to extend the defined local spatial transformations to their combination with the operation of time - reversal @xmath85 , represented here as usual by an antiunitary operator @xmath86 performing complex conjugation @xcite , @xmath87 in the spatial representation .",
    "time - reversal thus acts on a state in the basis @xmath58 as @xmath88 and transforms the hamiltonian as @xmath89 ( defined by @xmath90 ) . the latter becomes relevant for complex onsite elements @xmath91 where positive ( negative ) @xmath92 models the gain ( loss ) rate of the state density at site @xmath47 ( as clarified in the next section ) , while complex hoppings @xmath93 with peierls phase @xmath94 generally arise from the presence of gauge fields ( effectively also in 1d systems @xcite ) . if the hamiltonian obeys ( cf .",
    "[ eq : hmn_local_ssym ] ) @xmath95 then we will call the system locally @xmath5-symmetric , that is , @xmath3-symmetric or @xmath96-symmetric within the finite spatial domain @xmath97 .",
    "note here that we treat ( local ) non - hermiticity , expressed through the @xmath92 , solely as an _ effective _ simple model to express gain or loss of density from or to the surrounding medium , rather than a fundamental description of the physical system .",
    "having defined the concept of ls for lattice systems , we shall now generalize the discrete continuity relation @xcite to a nonlocal form adapted to a given the symmetry mapping .      in equivalence to the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : schr ] ) for a general state @xmath56 , the temporal evolution of the local density @xmath98",
    "fulfills the discrete continuity equation @xmath99 with @xmath100 being the local density operator in the schrdinger picture , where @xmath101 is the sum of the magnitudes @xmath102 of the currents @xmath103 flowing inwards from sites @xmath104 to site @xmath47 . under the assumption of hermitian hoppings , @xmath105 ,",
    "the total current magnitude can be written as the expectation value @xmath106 of a current operator @xmath107\\ ] ] assigned to site @xmath47 .",
    "note that the discrete form of the current divergence entering the continuity equation is generally given by the sum of the projections @xmath108 of the link currents @xmath109 from point @xmath110 to point @xmath111 onto their directions @xmath112 , scaled by the distance @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "the local ( referring to site @xmath47 ) continuity equation ( [ eq : continuity_local ] ) shows that the imaginary part @xmath114 of the onsite element @xmath21 acts like a source ( @xmath115 ) or sink ( @xmath116 ) of density @xmath117 at site @xmath47 , in addition to the inflow of current @xmath118 .",

    "the crossing from zero to nonzero nlc thus provides an extended identification of a @xmath3 ` phase transition ' in scattering beyond @xmath564-matrix eigenstates @xcite , identical to that of bound systems ( as discussed above in [ sec : non - hermitian ] ) .",
    "more importantly , the vanishing of nlcs can be employed to identify configurations with _ locally _ @xmath3-invariant states , that is , where [ eq : q_p_zero ] is fulfilled in a @xmath3-symmetric subdomain of the setup . as an example , in [ fig : local_pt ] we consider a non - hermitian setup of two attached domains @xmath588 , @xmath589 with loss / gain parameter pairs @xmath736 , @xmath737 , respectively .",
    "the setup is designed such that it is globally @xmath3-symmetric ( @xmath0-symmetric ) for @xmath738 ( @xmath739 ) . as we see in [ fig : local_pt](a1 ) , there are values of @xmath740 where [ eq : conservation_pt ] is fulfilled at certain energies ( see white contours ) , such that the system behaves as being @xmath3-symmetric in terms of its @xmath564-matrix .",
    "interestingly , it is possible to fulfill [ eq : conservation_pt ] at all @xmath75 with a locally @xmath3-symmetric setup for appropriately chosen loss / gain parameters , as seen for the present setup for @xmath741 ( lower horizontal white line in [ fig : local_pt](a1 ) ) . in [ fig : local_pt](a2 ) and ( a3 ) we see that the nlcs @xmath742 and @xmath743 , corresponding to local @xmath3-symmetry in @xmath588 and @xmath589 , vanish at different contours in the @xmath744-plane , revealing the occurrence of locally symmetric density embedded into the globally @xmath3-asymmetric system .    leaving a more comprehensive investigation of nlcs in relation to scattering properties of locally @xmath3-symmetric setups for future work , we focus now on their spatial constancy in 1d domains .",
    "this is illustrated in [ fig : local_pt](b ) and ( c ) , where the considered setup is , apart from locally @xmath3-symmetric , also globally @xmath3- and @xmath0-symmetric , respectively .",
    "at the chosen generic @xmath75-values , the density profile @xmath82 is completely asymmetric under any of those symmetry transformations at the chosen ( generic ) @xmath75-values . for the local @xmath0 transforms in @xmath588 and @xmath589 , the domainwise constancy of the associated nlc",

    "a discrete nonlocal current - density continuity formalism was developed to relate localized spatial symmetries to schrdinger wave properties in hermitian and non - hermitian lattice systems .",
    "sources and sinks of the nonlocal currents ( nlcs ) are identified in the breaking of the local symmetries ( lss ) , with the associated charge evolution governed by the nlcs at symmetry domain boundaries . for stationary states ,",
    "the symmetry - adapted nlcs are translationally invariant in one - dimensional finite domains with @xmath273-symmetric sub - hamiltonians , where @xmath6 ( inversion ) or @xmath1 ( translation ) is potentially combined with @xmath2 ( time reversal ) .",
    "these invariant nlcs reflect the local symmetries of generic single - particle lattice hamiltonians encoded into arbitrarily irregular field profiles , and enable the mapping between wave amplitudes of symmetry - related sites in finite domains .",
    "we illustrated the nlc invariance in cases of complete , overlapping , and gapped domainwise symmetry , as well as for non - hermitian ( locally ) @xmath3- and @xmath96-symmetric ( scattering ) systems with balanced gain and loss . in scattering setups ,",
    "the nlcs were further shown to classify perfect transmission resonances with respect to their spatially resolved density profile , being symmetric ( asymmetric ) in adjacent locally symmetric lattice subdomains with equal and zero ( nonzero ) nlc magnitude .",
    "further , in periodically driven setups the nlc invariance was shown to be retained for quasi - stationary ( floquet ) states on period - average , thus revealing lss also far from equilibrium .",
    "we have here utilized photonic waveguide arrays as an applicational platform since they are well described by a discrete schrdinger equation with nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the formalism and general results apply equally to other lattice systems modeled effectively by a discrete schrdinger equation , like superlattice nanostructures or quantum dot arrays @xcite . for stationary states",
    "the applicability is further broadened to generic wave mechanical systems described by a discretized helmholtz equation , such as e.g. granular acoustic media with domainwise homogeneities @xcite . in the limit of large site density with constant inter - site hopping ,",
    "the same formalism can be equally employed for spatially continuous systems ( with the lattice used as a numerical grid ) , treating simulations of , e.g. , photonic multilayer devices @xcite or acoustic waveguides @xcite .",
    "the present operator formulation of the nlcs , expressed in [ eq : q_n_+-_p_operator ] , further enables a straightforward extension beyond nearest neighbor couplings or to higher dimensions , simply by including the additional couplings into the hopping operators @xmath124 accordingly .",
    "in general , the net nlc assigned to a site with ( multidimensional ) index @xmath748 will then consist of the sum of nonlocal link currents @xmath749 over connected sites @xmath750 for a given symmetry operation @xmath4 , defined in analogy with the 1d nlcs in [ eq : q_n+- ] . a thorough account on symmetry considerations and associated nlcs in planar discrete systems , where rotations and plane reflections add to the possible @xmath4-transforms ,",
    "will be presented in a future work @xcite .",
    "multidimensional divergence naturally prevents individual @xmath751 from being spatially constant along a selected dimension , just as is the case for the usual current .",
    "nlc invariance does apply if the sites @xmath750 above represent next - nearest or ( selected ) remote neighbors along a _",
    "dimension , as is effectively the case , e.g. , for zigzag chains with embedded scatterers @xcite or discrete helical structures @xcite , respectively . extended locally symmetric domains in such setups",
    "will then be distinguished by constant nlcs in arbitrary stationary states .",
    "finally , the domainwise invariant stationary nlcs may be generalized to discrete interacting systems where the _ interaction _ itself is represented by a locally @xmath5-symmetric function on the lattice sites .",
    "a promising case would be the discrete version of self - induced @xmath3-symmetric potentials @xcite in lattice subdomains , with the mean - field nonlinear ( gross - pitaevskii ) term @xmath752 replaced by the nonlocal density @xmath753 . with the above perspectives",
    ", we believe that the developed connection between discrete nonlocal continuity and symmetry - induced subdomain invariants may contribute to the understanding of wave structure and response in discrete systems with localized spatial regularities .",
    "we are thankful to malte rntgen for fruitful suggestions and critical reading of the manuscript , as well as to steffen weimann and alexandra v. zampetaki for helpful discussions .",
    "augmenting the scatterer domain @xmath33 by two lead sites on each side ( @xmath754 and @xmath755 in the present indexing ) , we can solve the close - coupling equations ( [ eq : schr_cc ] ) for the outgoing plane wave amplitudes @xmath581 as well as the site amplitudes @xmath756^\\top\\ ] ] along the scatterer by sparse matrix multiplication and inversion of size @xmath757 . specifically , using the asymptotic ansatz ( [ eq : scat_bc ] ) for the two sites on either side of @xmath33 , we rearrange the schrdinger system of @xmath757 next - neighbor equations to solve for @xmath581 and @xmath163 in the form of the column vector @xmath758^{-1 }   \\begin{bmatrix}\\ ,     ( h^*\\zeta^ * + \\tilde{v } ) \\zeta^{+l}\\ , { { \\mathfrak{c}}}_<^+ \\ , \\\\",

    "the above method is essentially equivalent to propagating the input signal via the resolvent ( lattice green function ) of the effective lead - coupled hamiltonian of the scattering region . here",
    ", however , we explicitly solve outgoing @xmath565-amplitudes and combine them compactly into a column vector with the spatially resolved field in the scatterer domain @xmath33 .",
    "this formulation of the scattering problem has an advantage over a standard site - by - site transfer matrix method in that the scatterer can be of arbitrary type : keeping a two - terminal geometry , the scatterer may contain , e.g. , side - coupled sites or a 2d cluster of interconnected sites .",
    "no explicit single - node transfer matrices propagating the wave along the scatterer need to be specified , rather the complete hamiltonian under appropriate indexing is utilized directly . +",

    "for nonzero local currents @xmath122 , the first matrix above ( with determinant @xmath782 ) is invertible and we can solve for the symmetry - transformed amplitudes to obtain @xmath783 the lower equation above yields the mapping relation in [ eq : current_mapping ] from @xmath784 to @xmath331 , where the upper ( @xmath167 ) _ or _ lower ( @xmath168 ) nlcs can be equally used .",
