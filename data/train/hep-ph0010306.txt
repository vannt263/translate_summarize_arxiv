    "the operation of a neutrino detector at energies above 1 tev poses challenging difficulties .",
    "one of the major limitations in the detection of a cosmic high - energy neutrino ( from galactic or extra - galactic origin ) is the background from atmospheric muons and neutrinos ( produced by the interaction of high - energy cosmic rays in the atmosphere ) .",
    "the source of the atmospheric neutrino background changes with energy , in a way governed by the critical energy @xmath0 of the parent particle .",
    "this is the energy for which the decay and interaction lengths are equal . above this energy",

    "comparing the critical energies we observe that muon decays contribute substantially to the atmospheric lepton flux only up to a few gev s , while the decays in flight of charged pions and kaons are still important up to about 1 - 10 tev .",

    "the semileptonic decay of very - short lived charmed particles ( mainly @xmath5-mesons and @xmath6-hyperons ) is the dominant source , despite their low production rate .",
    "the main contribution comes from the decay modes @xmath7    muons and neutrinos thus generated are called `` prompt leptons '' , and they exhibit a flatter ( and thus harder ) energy spectrum .",
    "the lack of precise information on high - energy charm production in hadron - nucleus collisions leads to a great uncertainty in the estimate of the leptonic flux above 100  tev .",

    "in addition , predictions based on this model seem to exceed the experimental observations of horizontal air showers , measured by akeno@xcite . finally , the calculation labeled zas ( a ) represents an extreme and crude upper bound for the prompt fluxes , based on the assumption that a charm is produced @xmath132 of the time in these high - energy interactions .",
    "actually , it is ruled out by the bounds set to the charm cross section from the above mentioned analysis of akeno data .",
    "one must be careful when analyzing differences in the curves of figure  [ fig : reported ] .",

    "the reason is that both the parent ( @xmath5 or @xmath133 ) and the daughter ( @xmath124 or @xmath134 ) particles are massive compared to the leptons and the decay kinematics become blind to lepton family number or flavor .",
    "the prompt lepton flux is also essentially independent of @xmath46 ( for depths greater than a few interaction lengths ) , due to the fact that the main contribution to the high - energy lepton flux must come from the first interactions of primary nucleons with air nuclei , while they are still energetic enough .",
    "in addition , for a fixed detection level , the flux is insensitive to the zenith angle @xmath73 , up to the charm critical energy .",
    "this is also a consequence of the fact that the bulk of energetic leptons are produced high in the atmosphere and will reach the detector , regardless the amount of atmosphere traversed ( less depth in the vertical direction , larger slant depths for showers close to the horizon ) . for energies above the critical energy ,",
    "the charm particle decay length becomes comparable to the interaction length , and we feel the effects of its angular dependence , given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : decay ] ) .",
    "since the prompt lepton flux is almost independent of lepton flavor , detection depth and zenith angle , hereafter we will perform our comparisons using the muon - neutrino vertical flux ( @xmath135 ) at sea level ( @xmath136 g/@xmath137 ) .",
    "first we investigate the effect of the primary spectrum at the top of the atmosphere ( section  [ section : primes ] ) .",
    "to do so we calculate the prompt lepton flux , keeping all ingredients fixed , but the primary flux . just for comparison purposes , we consider ingredients for the showering process used by bugaev .",
    "the effect of the primary spectrum , alone , to the final result is considerable , as shown in figure  [ fig : result1 ] .",
    "the spread on the resulting fluxes generally increases with energy .",
    "for example , at @xmath138gev , the difference between using lipari s single slope and tig s primary is a factor 10 times , while they started together at @xmath119 gev .",
    "also a big shift is present for the curve with akeno primary against all others with knee , above @xmath139 gev .",
    "the next two ingredients considered are the nucleonic interaction length and the nucleonic z - moment ( section  [ section : sigmas ] ) .",
    "apart from assuming a constant interaction length ( as done by lipari ) , for which the overestimated value at high energies pulls the neutrino flux down , the resulting fluxes are rather insensitive to the choice of @xmath62 .",
    "similar situation occurs with the fluxes calculated changing only the nucleonic z - moments , the difference being that the overestimated flux comes from tig ( @xmath140 , at energies below @xmath139 gev ) , pushing the neutrino flux up , while other models ( @xmath141 ) , result basically in the same final prompt flux .",
    "the fluxes are also rather insensitive to the charm interaction length up to @xmath142 gev , as they should , since that is about the value of @xmath0 for charmed particles ( see table  [ table : pdg ] ) . above this range",
    "we discriminate the models up to a factor of two times , whether we use @xmath143 constant or with a @xmath144 dependence .    when evaluating the effects of the choice of charm production model ( section  [ section : zch ] ) , the big uncertainties in the inclusive cross sections of charm production are transmitted to the calculated prompt lepton fluxes , as seen in figure  [ fig : result2 ] .",
    "the spread between the prompt flux calculated with rqpm - sv and pqcd reaches a multiplicative factor of 20 at higher energies , solely due to the choice of @xmath63 .      in the previous section",
    "the effect of each individual ingredient of the atmospheric showering process has been appreciated .",
    "now , we investigate how the choice of multiple ingredients combined in different ways affects the resulting flux .",
    "let s consider an example .",
    "the choice of the production model qgsm makes the flux dominates over other choices of charm production only up to about @xmath145  gev , if all other parameters are fixed ( figure  [ fig : result2 ] ) .",
    "the combination of the qgsm with the akeno primary flux , which solely contributes to larger prompt flux up to @xmath142  gev ( figure  [ fig : result1 ] ) , makes this new set dominate upon a broader range of energy . choosing a charm interaction length model that is responsible for increasing the prompt flux at higher energies , we build a set which dominates over yet a larger range .",
    "such a combination of showering parameters leads to a maximum flux configuration . with a similar procedure we can build a minimum configuration . in this case",
    "it is interesting to consider the effect of lipari s primary up to the energy of the knee , above which bugaev s model - d for the primary spectrum produces the minimum prompt flux .",

    "the calculation of the prompt lepton flux produced in the atmosphere by the semileptonic decay of charmed particles is rather straightforward , but we can not say the same for the analysis of the results . for instance , the lack of precise information on high - energy charm inclusive cross - section in hadron - nucleus collisions is accompanied by a variety of options for the particle showering process in the atmosphere .",
    "we described different ingredients of the calculation , comparing side by side several parametrizations for each one of them , and evaluated their relative importance to the final result .",
    "the major effects are due to the choice of the primary spectrum at the top of the atmosphere and , of course , to the choice of the charm particle production model . only first nucleonic interactions play essential role in determining the prompt lepton flux down at sea level , therefore variations in the nucleonic attenuation lengths are not that relevant , while the charm interaction length have some influence , above the charm particle critical energy .",
    "we observed how different combinations of ingredients can shift the resulting flux curves up or down .",
    "therefore , the comparison between different calculations must be carried out with great care .",
    "the bands displayed in figures  [ fig : result3]-[fig : result5 ] correspond to the allowed regions for the prompt lepton flux calculated respectively with the charm production models qgsm , rqpm and pqcd , if the showering process parameters are mixed differently .    the prompt lepton crossover energy , that is the energy above which the charm particle decay products dominate over the conventional pion and kaon decay induced fluxes , is yet an uncertain quantity . according to figures  [ fig : result3]-[fig : result5 ] , it may be anywhere between @xmath146 and @xmath120 gev .",
    "if the cross - over is `` low enough '' ( about @xmath146 gev ) , then neutrino telescopes now operational can therefore take advantage of the isotropy of the prompt lepton flux , to search for an zenith angle independent component in their data .",
    "this can also be pursued by the analysis of the more copiously detected down - going muons .    exploiting the case of tau - neutrinos , which may produce a clear signature in high - energy neutrino detectors@xcite ,",
    "will be addressed in a future analysis .",
    "there is also the need for a more comprehensive description of the available data on charm production cross section , and its extrapolation to higher energies .",
    "the prompt lepton flux is on the order - of - the - day of operating high - energy neutrino telescopes , because of the background it represents .",
    "proposed experiments , like icecube  @xcite , may turn the arguments the other way around , for their measurements with enhanced sensitivity may provide outstanding information on heavy quark interactions , just by discriminating atmospheric from cosmic neutrinos , at energies above tens of tev .",
