    "phantom field is a special kind of dark energy model with the negative kinetic energy @xcite , which is applied extensively in cosmology to explain the accelerating expansion of the current universe @xcite .",
    "comparing with other dark energy models , the phantom field is more interesting because that the presence of negative kinetic energy results in that the equation of state of the phantom field is less than @xmath8 and then the null energy condition is violated .",
    "although the phantom field owns such exotic properties , it is still not excluded by recent precise observational data @xcite , which encourages many people to focus on investigating phantom field from various aspects of physics .",
    "phantom field also exhibits some peculiar properties in the black hole physics .",
    "e. babichev @xcite found that the mass of a black hole decreases when it absorbs the phantom dark energy .",
    "this means that the cosmic censorship conjecture is challenged severely by a fact that the charge of a reissner - nordstrm - like black hole absorbing the phantom energy will be larger than its mass .",
    "we studied the wave dynamics of the phantom scalar perturbation in the schwarzschild black hole spacetime and that in the late - time evolution the phantom scalar perturbation grows with an exponential rate rather than decays as the usual scalar perturbations @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also find that the phantom scalar emission will enhance the hawking radiation of a black hole @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some black hole solutions describing gravity coupled to phantom scalar fields or phantom maxwell fields have also been found in @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamics and the possibility of phase transitions in these phantom black holes are studied in @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse of a charged scalar field @xcite and the light paths @xcite are investigated in such kind of spacetimes .",
    "moreover , s. bolokhov _ et al _ also study the regular electrically and magnetically charged black hole with a phantom scalar in @xcite .",
    "these investigations could help us to get a deeper understand about dark energy and black hole physics .",
    "a global monopole is one of the topological defects which could be formed during phase transitions in the evolution of the early universe .",
    "the metric describing a static black hole with a global monopole was obtained by barriola and vilenkin @xcite , which arises from the breaking of global so(3 ) symmetry of a triplet scalar field in a schwarzschild background . due to the presence of the global monopole",
    ", the black hole owns different topological structure from that of the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the physical properties of the black hole with a global monopole have been studied extensively in recent years @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the gravitational field of phantom global monopole arising from a triplet scalar field with negative kinetic energy and to see how the energy scale of symmetry breaking @xmath2 influences the structure of black hole , the kepler s third law , the innermost stable circular orbit and the radiative efficiency @xmath4 in the thin accretion disk model .",
    "moreover , we will explore how it differs from that in the black hole with ordinary global monopole .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the following section we will construct a static and spherical symmetric solution of a phantom global monopole from a triplet scalar field with negative kinetic energy , and then study the effect of the parameter @xmath2 on the black hole . in sec.iii , we obtain a slowly rotating black hole with phantom global monopole by solving einstein s field equation and find that presence of global monopole make the metric coefficient of black hole more complex . in sec.iv , we will focus on investigating the effects of the parameter @xmath2 on the kepler s third law , the innermost stable circular orbit and the radiative efficiency @xmath4 in the thin accretion disk model .",
    "we end the paper with a summary .",
    "let us now first study a static and spherical symmetric black hole with phantom global monopole formed by spontaneous symmetry breaking of a triplet of phantom scalar fields with a global symmetry group @xmath9 .",
    "the action giving rise to the phantom global monopole is @xmath10,\\label{act1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is a triplet of scalar field with @xmath12 , @xmath2 is the energy scale of symmetry breaking and @xmath13 is a constant .",
    "the coupling constant @xmath14 in the kinetic term takes the value @xmath15 corresponds to the case of the ordinary global monopole originating from the scalar field with the positive kinetic energy @xcite . as the coupling constant @xmath16 , the kinetic energy of the scalar field is negative and then the phantom global monopole is formed .",
    "following in ref.@xcite , we can take ansatz describing a monopole as @xmath17 where @xmath18 . equipping with the general static and spherical symmetric metric @xmath19",
    "one can find that the field equations for @xmath11 can be reduced to a single equation for @xmath20 @xmath21\\xi f'-\\frac{2\\xi f}{r^2}-\\lambda \\eta^2f(f^2 - 1)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] moreover , the energy - momentum tensor for the spacetime with a global monopole can be expressed as @xmath22\\xi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2,\\\\ t^r_r&=&\\bigg[-\\frac{\\eta^2f'^2}{2a}+\\frac{\\eta^2f^2}{r^2}\\bigg]\\xi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2,\\\\ t^{\\theta}_{\\theta}&=&t^{\\phi}_{\\phi}=\\frac{\\xi\\eta^2f'^2}{2a } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly , as in ref.@xcite , one can take an approximation @xmath23 outside the core due to a fact that @xmath20 grows linearly when @xmath24 and tends exponentially to unity as soon as @xmath25 . with this approximation , we can obtain a solution of the einstein equations @xmath26 where @xmath27 is an integrate constant .",
    "obviously , the radius of event horizon is @xmath28 . here",
    "we must point that it is possible that the radius of event horizon @xmath29 is larger than the monopole s",
    "core @xmath30 if the coupling constant @xmath31 . in this case , the metric ( [ metric0 ] ) can describe the geometry near the horizon in the spacetime with global monopole . with the increase of the energy scale of symmetry breaking @xmath2",
    ", one can find that the radius of event horizon @xmath29 increases for a schwarzschild black hole with the ordinary global monopole ( @xmath32 ) , but decreases for a schwarzschild black hole with the phantom global monopole ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "thus , comparing with the system @xmath32 , one can find that the system @xmath33 possesses the higher hawking temperature and the lower entropy . in the low energy limit",
    ", the luminosity of hawking radiation of a spherical symmetric black hole can be approximated as @xmath34 , which tells us that the energy scale of symmetry breaking @xmath2 enhances hawking radiation for the system @xmath33 , but it decreases hawking radiation in the system @xmath32 .",
    "the presence of the phantom field enhances the hawking emission of kerr black hole are also found in @xcite .    introducing the following transformations",
    "@xmath35 one can rewrite the metric ( [ metric0 ] ) with the functions ( [ fba11 ] ) as @xmath36 it is clear that there exists a deficit solid angle @xmath37 for the system @xmath32 .",
    "however , for the system @xmath33 ( i.e. , @xmath16 ) , one can find that the solid angle becomes @xmath38 , which is surplus rather than deficit .",
    "this implies that the topological properties of a spacetime with the phantom global monopole is different from that of with a ordinary global monopole .",
    "in this section , we first obtain the metric for a slowly rotating black hole with phantom global monopole by solving einstein s field equation . and then , we will study the properties of the black hole spacetime .    from the static and spherical symmetric solution ( [ metric0 ] ) with the metric function ( [ fba11 ] ) , we can assume the metric has a form for a slowly rotating black hole with phantom global monopole @xmath39 where @xmath7 is a parameter associated with its angular momentum .",
    "moreover , we assume that in the slowly rotating spacetime ( [ metric3 ] ) the ansatz describing a monopole is @xmath40 it is easy to find that the field equations for @xmath11 can also be reduced to a single equation for @xmath20 @xmath41\\xi f'-\\frac{2\\xi f}{r^2}-\\lambda \\eta^2f(f^2 - 1)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is similar to that in the static and spherical symmetric spacetime ( [ metric0 ] ) .",
    "it is not surprising since the triplet scalar field @xmath42 does not depend on the time coordinate @xmath43 .",
    "inserting the metric ( [ metric3 ] ) and the triplet scalar ( [ gms1 ] ) into the einstein field equation , we find that the non - vanishing components of field equation can be expanded to first order in the angular momentum parameter @xmath7 as @xmath44 + 8\\pi u(r)\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\eta^2f'^2u(r)}{2}+\\frac{\\eta^2f^2}{r^2}\\bigg)\\xi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2\\bigg]=0+\\mathcal{o}(a^2),\\label{gt1}\\\\ rr : & & \\frac{1}{u(r)r^2}\\bigg[u'(r)r+u(r)-1\\bigg]+ \\frac{8\\pi}{u(r)}\\bigg[\\bigg(-\\frac{\\eta^2f'^2u(r)}{2}+\\frac{\\eta^2f^2}{r^2}\\bigg)\\xi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2\\bigg]=0+\\mathcal{o}(a^2)\\label{gt2},\\\\ \\theta \\theta:&&-\\frac{r}{2}\\bigg[u''(r)r+2u'(r)\\bigg]+8\\pi r^2\\bigg[\\frac{\\xi\\eta^2f'^2u(r)}{2 } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2\\bigg]=0+\\mathcal{o}(a^2)\\label{gt3},\\\\ \\phi\\phi:&&-\\frac{r}{2}\\sin^2\\theta\\bigg[u''(r)r+2u'(r)\\bigg]+8\\pi r^2\\bigg[\\frac{\\xi\\eta^2f'^2u(r)}{2 } + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2\\bigg]\\sin^2\\theta=0+\\mathcal{o}(a^2)\\label{gt4},\\\\ t\\phi:&&\\frac{1}{2r^2}\\bigg\\{r^2u(r)\\frac{\\partial^2f(r,\\theta)}{\\partial r^2}-f(r,\\theta)\\bigg[r^2u''(r)+2ru'(r)+2u(r)\\bigg]+2f(r,\\theta)+ \\frac{\\partial^2f(r,\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta^2}-\\frac{\\partial f(r,\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}\\cot\\theta\\bigg\\}\\nonumber\\\\&&-8\\pi f(r,\\theta)\\bigg[\\bigg(\\frac{\\eta^2f'^2u(r)}{2}+\\frac{\\eta^2f^2}{r^2}\\bigg)\\xi + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\eta^4(f^2 - 1)^2\\bigg]=0+\\mathcal{o}(a^2)\\label{gt5}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] solving the einstein equations ( [ gt1])-([gt4 ] ) with the approximation @xmath23 outside the core , we can obtain the metric coefficient @xmath45 separating @xmath46 , we can obtain the equation for the angular part @xmath47 in order to that the coefficient @xmath0 can be reduced to that in the slowly rotating black hole without the global monopole , here we set @xmath48 and find that @xmath49 in this case .",
