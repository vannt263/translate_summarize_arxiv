    "from subatomic to astrophysical scales , spatially - bound objects result from the interplay between attractive and repulsive interactions whenever there is an energy gain .",

    "spatially - bound objects are solutions to the nonlinear equations modeling the system @xcite with energy density vanishing at spatial infinity .    in most cases",
    "the methodology is similar : spatially - localized solutions are sought for certain boundary conditions ; once found , their stability under certain classes of perturbations is explored , usually by varying one or more physical parameters . from solitons in field theory @xcite to stellar objects @xcite , the onset of instability is usually identified by a growing perturbation .    in the present work",
    "we explore the physics of spatially - localized objects using a newly proposed quantity that , as will be shown here , discriminates between stable and unstable configurations _ without _ the use of perturbative techniques .",
    "our method is based on the configurational entropy ( ce ) proposed by gleiser and stamatopoulos @xcite .",

    "next , we use the ce to investigate the stability of gravitationally - bound stars known as newtonian polytropes @xcite , showing that the ce correctly predicts the onset of instability known as the chandrasekhar limit for white dwarfs .",
