    "the ads / cft correspondence @xcite provides a unique window into the dynamics of a class of strongly coupled gauge field theories . for large @xmath0 gauge theories , the dynamics in the planar limit",
    "is expected to be effectively classical , with @xmath1 controlling the quantum corrections . for a class of superconformal field theories arising as world - volume theories on d - branes or m - branes ,",
    "the ads / cft correspondence identifies this classical dynamics of the single trace sector with that of classical string theory in a higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "furthermore , if the field theory is strongly coupled then one can truncate to the zero mode sector of the string theory , viz .",
    ", classical gravity in this higher dimensional spacetime .",
    "the correspondence therefore provides an avenue to explore the strong coupling dynamics of field theories by reformulating the physics in terms of an effective classical gravity theory .",
    "in this paper we continue our investigation of strongly coupled field theories on black hole backgrounds using the ads / cft correspondence , generalizing the results of @xcite .",
    "field theories in curved spacetime are known to exhibit a rich array of physical phenomena ranging from vacuum polarization and particle production to hawking radiation and its associated puzzles with information loss .",
    "however , much of the investigation in the past has focussed on perturbative field theory due to the lack of access to the full non - perturbative quantum state , even in the context where gravity is non - dynamical .",
    "our current interest lies in understanding relevant quantum states beyond perturbation theory ; this is where ads / cft comes into play .",
    "consider a field theory on a non - dynamical curved spacetime ( which we denote as @xmath2 ) with metric @xmath3 .",
    "we would like to know the behavior of interesting quantum states and in particular the expectation values of gauge invariant local operators at the non - perturbative level .",
    "if we restrict attention to strongly coupled conformal fields which arise in low - energy limits of d - brane world - volume theories , then we can exploit the ads / cft correspondence to answer these questions .",
    "this is achieved by identifying higher - dimensional asymptotically ads gravitational solutions dual to the desired field theory states on @xmath2 ; we will refer to these gravitational saddle points as @xmath4 .",
    "such bulk spacetimes are found by solving the gravitational equations of motion subject to the boundary condition that @xmath4 has as its timelike boundary @xmath2 . of the bulk spacetime @xmath4",
    "be in the same conformal class as @xmath2 .",
    "we will however demand that @xmath5 in fact is isometric to @xmath2 . ] in particular , smooth static spacetimes are candidate duals for the field theory hartle - hawking states .",
    "of course , it might turn out that the field theory in question has a non - trivial phase structure , which implies that there are multiple such static saddle points for the bulk gravity description @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we examined in some detail the holographic duals of field theories on black hole backgrounds @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we have argued that there are new classes of black hole geometries in asymptotically ads spacetimes : i ) single connected horizon solutions which we called black funnels and ii ) solutions with two disconnected horizons ; see . in the latter case , we called the component connected to the boundary horizon a black droplet . on the boundary ( we will refer to this as  @xmath6-compact \" ) .",
    "in contrast , when the boundary spacetime has a good asymptotic region describing physics far from the boundary black hole , a black funnel should asymptote to the bulk solution describing a deconfined plasma in this distant region of spacetime . for example , in the case of asymptotically flat boundaries , it should asymptote to the planar ads black hole . as we discuss below",
    ", the distinction between droplets and funnels is more subtle for spatially compact boundary metrics . ]",
    "the funnel solutions are dual to black holes coupling strongly to the field theory plasma .",
    "in contrast , the droplet solutions describe black holes coupling only weakly . in particular , the second outer horizon present in these solutions is interpreted as the field theory plasma , while the droplet itself describes field theory vacuum polarization near the horizon .",
    "the lack of connection between these two ads horizons is evidence of the weak coupling .",
    "note that while the gravitational dynamics may allow solutions where the two horizons have different temperatures , only the equal temperature solutions can be dual to field theory hartle - hawking states .    as evidence for this picture , ref .",
    "@xcite exhibited funnel and droplet solutions dual to @xmath7 and @xmath8 dimensional conformal fields living on black hole backgrounds .",
    "in the @xmath7 case , we constructed black funnel solutions in whose boundary is the two dimensional black hole @xcite . while black droplets do not arise for @xmath7 boundary black holes , by exploiting the known ads c - metric solutions we were also able to construct both black funnels and black droplets in four bulk spacetime dimensions .",
    "however , the droplet solutions found in this way do not generically describe hartle - hawking states as they were accompanied by a second horizon of a different temperature , so that the solutions did not describe equilibria .",
    "due to the properties of the c - metric , the relevant 2 + 1 boundary metrics described black holes which asymptote to @xmath9 .        a natural question to ask",
    "is whether further interesting solutions are hidden among the ads c - metrics . in the present work",
    ", we analyze this issue within the family of uncharged , non - rotating ads c - metric solutions .",
    "recall that the ads c - metric solutions have been useful in the past to construct localized black holes on a uv brane in the brane - world context @xcite and also more recently to construct plasma ball solutions on an ir brane @xcite ( see also @xcite ) our interest is to remove the uv brane and work with some prescribed boundary metric .",
    "since we are not a - priori fussed about what metrics we have on the boundary ( apart from the fact that they be black hole like ) , it seems plausible that new interesting solutions will emerge .",
    "as we shall see in the following , there is indeed a rich class of boundary black holes contained within the c - metric family .    with this motivation",
    ", we undertake an exhaustive search of the ads c - metric family of solutions and find an interesting class of black funnel and black droplet solutions . in all cases , by using standard holographic methods we are able to compute the boundary stress tensor which includes the contribution from the quantum dynamics of the field theory in curved spacetime .",
    "we find that the stress tensor does indeed capture the thermal aspect of hawking radiation and is furthermore regular on the black hole horizon in the boundary .    on the boundary we generally find black holes living in spatially compact universes ;",
    "i.e. , there are no spatial asymptopia .",
    "this class of solutions is therefore somewhat different from those which arise for the special choice of parameters examined in @xcite , where the boundary metric was asymptotically a hyperbolic cylinder @xmath9 . due to the absence of an asymptotic region",
    ", the precise definitions of funnel and droplet given in @xcite do not apply .",
    "we therefore extend these definitions in below .",
    "our new definitions are sufficient for spacetimes such as the c - metric which have an appropriate rotational killing field , even if they lack a useful asymptotic region .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : we begin in with a brief overview of the ads c - metric solutions .",
    "while these geometries have been studied in the literature before , we find it useful to review and generalize some of the results , especially those pertaining to the precise coordinate domains .",
    "we then analyze the c - metric family in detail in section , where we show that , apart from trivial cases that are exactly ads or a quotient , any uncharged , non - rotating asymptotically ads c - metric with vanishing nut charge can be interpreted in terms of funnels , droplets , and planar black holes .",
    "the discussion can clearly be generalized to include additional charges , but we refrain from doing so here in order to keep the discussion simple .",
    "we extract the boundary stress tensor for these solutions in which allows us to see the advertised thermal behavior of the field theories in black hole backgrounds .",
    "we end with a discussion in and describe some subtle limits in appendix [ s : lambn1 ] .",
    "the c - metric solution in four dimensions corresponds physically to a pair of black holes being uniformly accelerated by a cosmic string .",
    "the most general solution was found in @xcite in the context of einstein - maxwell theory with a cosmological constant .",
    "the general solution is specified by seven parameters , corresponding to the mass , angular momentum , an acceleration parameter , electric and magnetic charges , cosmological constant and a nut parameter .",
    "we will be interested in a sub - class of these solutions which we will exploit in the context of the ads / cft correspondence to study four dimensional bulk spacetime duals of @xmath8 dimensional field theories living on a black hole background .",
    "consider the sub - class of ads c - metrics @xcite whose line element is given in conventional c - metric coordinates as : @xmath10 where the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in are of the form : @xmath13 these metrics describe uncharged , non - rotating solutions with vanishing nut charge which are negatively curved , i.e. , they solve einstein s equations with negative cosmological constant @xmath14 the ads c - metric describes the geometry of accelerating black holes in an asymptotically ads spacetime . in the metric",
    ", @xmath15 captures the ( inverse ) acceleration , while @xmath16 is related to the cosmological constant and @xmath17 is the mass parameter of the black hole(s ) .",
    "since cases with @xmath18 are locally isometric to either flat space or ads@xmath19 , we use the symmetry @xmath20 to take @xmath21 .",
    "the bulk ads scale is @xmath22 so that @xmath23 at fixed @xmath15 is the flat space limit ( and @xmath24 would give desitter - c metrics ) .",
    "we therefore take @xmath25 .",
    "finally , @xmath26 is a discrete variable taking values @xmath27 and corresponds to different allowed topologies for the black holes ; @xmath28 corresponds to topologically spherical horizons while @xmath29 corresponds to non - compact horizons with @xmath30 topology .",
    "a detailed discussion of the ads - c metric properties can be found in @xcite for @xmath28 and in @xcite for other values of @xmath26 . here",
    "we note only that by taking a suitable @xmath31 limit one can recover the standard black hole for @xmath28 . for @xmath32",
    "one obtains the topological black hole of @xcite and one can get the planar ads black hole in the case when @xmath33 .",
    "let us now examine the geometry of the ads c - metric , more carefully , to classify all the distinct possibilities as we vary the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath26 ( we can ignore the parameter @xmath15 as it merely provides an overall scale ) .",
    "the key features ( boundaries , horizons , singularites ) are determined by the coordinate ranges and the roots of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 in .",
    "below , we first discuss the coordinate ranges and motivate the physical properties of the solutions , and in we study the root structure in more detail ( summarized in for the case of @xmath34 and for @xmath35 ) .    due to the conformal factor @xmath36 in the metric",
    ", it is clear that the boundary of the spacetime is at @xmath37 .",
    "furthermore , the spacetime has singularities at @xmath38 and at @xmath39 which are genuine curvature singularities ; the kretschmann scalar @xmath40 diverges as @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "typically this has led previous analysis of the ads c - metric to restrict attention to the region @xmath42 .",
    "however , we will see that it is also sensible to consider the region @xmath43 , at least for certain choices of parameters . of course",
    ", in making these choices we have to ensure that the spacetime in question does nt have any naked singularities .",
    "we will return to this issue after a short examination of the coordinate ranges .    to determine the range of @xmath44 we need to examine the function @xmath45 .",
    "being a cubic , @xmath45 generically has three roots and as a result we can have two cases : ( i ) either the roots are all real , ( ii ) or only one root is real . when @xmath28 the distinction between the two situations is controlled by the mass parameter @xmath17 , whereas for @xmath46 only the case ( ii ) occurs ( see )",
    ". we will order the roots as @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , with @xmath47 taken to be the smallest root of @xmath45 in case ( i ) and we take @xmath49 to be the solitary root in case ( ii ) .",
    "horizons arise at the values of @xmath50 for which @xmath51 .",
    "we will denote the roots again by @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 with @xmath55 . in the situations where @xmath56 has a single root , we will for simplicity",

    "for instance , in the simple case @xmath57 with @xmath28 we have @xmath58 in general the formula for the roots @xmath59 as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath16 is messy and we will not write it down . however , it is useful to note that from @xmath21 , the relation @xmath60 , and the fact that @xmath61 is an extremum of both functions , one can deduce the ordering @xmath62 when all roots are real .",
    "see for plots of the functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 for various values of parameters .",
    "when some roots are complex , the remaining real roots generally still satisfy ( [ order ] ) with the missing roots removed from the list .",
    "a rather trivial exception occurs for @xmath63 in which case we have @xmath64 , replacing two of the inequalities in ( [ order ] ) by equalities .",

    "once one identifies the location of the cosmic string one can ask whether it hits the boundary .",
    "the place where it hits the boundary is a conical defect on the boundary and ideally one would like to hide this behind the black hole horizon or to choose the period of @xmath89 so that the defect disappears .",
    "one also wishes to ensure that the bulk curvature singularities at @xmath92 are likewise hidden behind horizons .    to probe this issue we need to consider all possible coordinate regions .",
    "we will do so in below , but let us first record two important facts which will play a crucial role in our analysis . by examining the behavior of the spatial part of the metric near a simple root of @xmath45 ,",
    "say @xmath87 , we learn that the spacetime will be regular provided we identify the coordinate @xmath89 with period @xmath93 secondly , depending on the range of the coordinates we choose , we will be interested in the proper distance between interesting points such as the event horizon and the location of the cosmic string on the boundary .",

    "this situation arises when we take @xmath28 and @xmath98 and was examined in some detail in @xcite .",
    "due to the presence of this internal infinity , geodesics approaching @xmath47 are complete and one has a well defined asymptotic region , viz .",
    ", @xmath9 .",
    "this was useful in the analysis of @xcite since one could disentangle the physics of the black hole horizon from any curved spacetime effects associated with lack of spatial asymptopia .",
    "below , we will investigate all the possible situations that arise from the ads c - metric in some detail .",
    "we now proceed to identify black funnels and black droplets in the c - metric spacetimes . we will find it convenient to separate the discussion into various cases determined by the discrete parameter @xmath26 , and into sub - cases depending on the range we allow for the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath50 .",
    "as we will see , for a given c - metric there are in general several different interesting coordinate domains to consider . in each case",
    ", we analyze the situation for all @xmath21 and @xmath25 .",
    "the special limit @xmath23 is treated separately in .",
    "now , in @xcite , droplets and funnels were primarily distinguished by their behavior with respect to the boundary s asymptotic region .",
    "black droplets had @xmath6-compact horizons ( by which we mean compact with respect to the conformally rescaled metric with the chosen boundary value @xmath3 ) , and so were well separated from the asymptopia of @xmath3 .",
    "black droplets were also typically suspended above a second horizon which did not connect to the boundary , though this was a secondary feature .",
    "in contrast , black funnel horizons were non - compact , and extended into the bulk region associated with the boundary @xmath3 asymptopia ; see . specifically , @xcite required black funnels to asymptote to the bulk black hole solution known to describe a deconfined plasma in the asymptotic region ; e.g. , a planar ads black hole for asymptotically flat boundaries or the hyperbolic ( aka topological ) black hole of @xcite for boundaries which approach @xmath99 .",
    "below , most of our boundary metrics will describe spatially compact universes , with no useful asymptotic regions . as a result",
    ", the definitions of black funnels and droplets given in @xcite do not apply and must be generalized .",
    "it is not clear to us what is the right definition in the broadest possible setting , or even whether a sharp distinction between droplets and funnels would remain possible .",
    "however , all the geometries we study below possess a rotational killing field @xmath100 which commutes with the static killing field @xmath101 . furthermore",
    ", each solution contains two special loci defined by @xmath100 .",
    "at least one of these ( but possibly both ) is an axis ( fixed point set ) of @xmath100 corresponding to a root @xmath102 or @xmath49 of @xmath45 where the norm vanishes . in the one - axis case ,",
    "the other is the singularity at @xmath103 , at which the norm of @xmath100 diverges .",
    "this structure may be used to give a useful definition as follows .",
    "first , in somewhat of an abuse of language , we refer to any horizon which does not reach the boundary as a _",
    "planar black hole _ , no matter what the geometry or topology . in our examples",
    "below , these will vaguely resemble the planar black hole of ( b ) .",
    "it then remains only to classify horizons which connect to the boundary .",
    "second , we remark that we are interested only in the so - called outer horizons , which by definition are horizons visible from the static region of the boundary . in some cases ,",
    "the boundary metric will have two static regions and we will be forced to first choose a particular such region as a reference point .",
    "now , since the horizons lie at constant @xmath50 and the axes / singularities of @xmath100 lie at constant @xmath44 ( and since @xmath44 and @xmath50 are independent ) , each outer horizon will intersect either one or both of the axes / singularities of @xmath100 .",
    "the case of zero intersections does not arise below .",
    "in addition , it is convenient that each horizon below with two such intersections fails to reach the boundary .",
    "when @xmath104 .",
    "in this case , the @xmath54 horizon might be said to develop a second intersection precisely at the boundary .",
    "however , taking the limit @xmath23 carefully so as to maintain the ads radius @xmath105 fixed leads to a solution with only a single intersection for each horizon which reaches the boundary .",
    "] as such , these are planar black holes in the sense described above and we need not consider this case further .",
    "it remains to classify the cases with a single intersection , which we do as follows :    * * black funnel : * when following a @xmath100 axis or singularity _ outward _ from the horizon leads toward the boundary , we call the horizon a black funnel . unless a second horizon is encountered , the axis or singularity then connects the horizon to the boundary through the visible static region . in such cases , an artistic impression of the spacetime resembles ( a ) , with the axis or singularity located near the edge of the diagram .",
    "below , this is always an axis as the singularity at @xmath106 is always hidden by a horizon on the boundary . in some sense , the point where the axis reaches the boundary plays the role of an asymptotic region for the boundary metric . when black funnels appear below , only one axis or singularity of @xmath100 will be visible from the static region of the boundary .",
    "* * black droplet : * when following a @xmath100 axis or singularity inward from the horizon leads toward the boundary , we call the horizon a black droplet . unless a second horizon is encountered , the axis or singularity then connects the horizon to the boundary through a hidden region behind the horizon . in the cases that arise below , we will always find a second separate @xmath100 axis or singularity that intersects the boundary outside the droplet horizon .",
    "one may think that the first axis or singularity plays the role of the origin while the second axis or singularity plays the role of an asymptotic region in the boundary metric . in this sense , an artistic impression of the spacetime resembles ( b ) . in cases that appear below",
    ", the first axis or singularity also extends `` below '' the droplet to intersect a planar black hole , a black funnel , or a new singularity .",
    "as the reader will note , the above definitions are based on geometric features of horizons which generalize those of funnels , droplets , and planar black holes as defined in @xcite and illustrated in .",
    "we nevertheless conjecture that , as for the original definition in @xcite , the funnel solutions are dual to field theory black holes coupling strongly to a deconfined plasma , while the droplets are dual to black holes coupling weakly .",
    "some evidence for this is provided by the fact that all droplet solutions below which are free of naked singularities also include a second disconnected outer horizon .",
    "this second horizon can be interpreted as describing the plasma , and the lack of connection as a sign of the weak coupling .",
    "see for further discussion .",
    "we begin our discussion with the case @xmath28 . for @xmath108",
    "we find that @xmath45 has three real roots and for @xmath109 we obtain a single real root .",
    "precisely for @xmath110 we have a degenerate root of @xmath45 ( this condition determines @xmath111 )  this was the situation discussed in detail in @xcite . as @xmath112 from below ,",
    "the roots @xmath47 and @xmath48 approach each other . for larger values of @xmath17 these roots move off into the complex plane .    now that we have understood the roots of @xmath12 , we can answer an important basic question : what restriction should we impose on the ranges of the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath50 ? in order to maintain the correct lorentzian signature of the metric , we require @xmath113 . for @xmath114 , this means that to avoid unwanted boundaries at finite distance we should consider either the region @xmath115 or alternately @xmath116 .",
    "the former is the conventional choice that has been made in previous analyses of the ads c - metric @xcite , but the latter is a perfectly reasonable coordinate domain as well",
    ". for @xmath109 we must take @xmath117 .",
    "we should also determine whether we restrict attention to the region @xmath118 or @xmath119 . to this end",
    "it is useful to introduce a new coordinate @xmath120 which keeps track of the distance from the boundary @xmath37 , so that we choose either @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "it is worth noting that the coordinate @xmath123 introduced in is not the conventional feffereman - graham coordinate , which would instead be defined via the gauge choice @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "plane which characterize the distinct possibilities for the root structure of @xmath126 and @xmath127 for @xmath28 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath127 is simply controlled by the parameter @xmath17 , while @xmath126 has non - trivial behavior across the various domains as indicated .",
    "see main text for a detailed explanation . ]    as a final piece of preparation , we describe the root structure of @xmath56 , which will in turn determine the horizons . recalling that the roots of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are ordered by ( with the exceptions noted in ) ,",
    "it is easy to convince oneself that @xmath56 behaves as follows for @xmath34 :    for @xmath128 we have @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "thus from we have a single real root at @xmath131 .",
    "for @xmath132 we encounter a double root at the origin , which is degenerate and corresponds to the bulk poincar horizon .    for @xmath133",
    "we have three real roots of the function @xmath126 , two of which are negative .",
    "in the special case when @xmath134 ( and @xmath135 ) , we have a double root at @xmath136 in addition to a single root at @xmath137 .    for @xmath138",
    "there is only one real root occurring at some @xmath139 . of course , this domain is non - empty only for @xmath109 .",
    "note that , due to our convention that the root be called @xmath52 whenever @xmath11 has only one real root , the function @xmath140 is discontinuous at @xmath141 .",
    "the single root for @xmath142 actually continuously connects to @xmath143 for @xmath144 .",
    "this is the cause of the main exception to ( [ order ] ) noted in .",
    "we are now in a position to list the various possible coordinate domains and to analyze each in turn as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath17 . for a complete illustration of the horizons in each domain , see .     for various values of @xmath17 .",
