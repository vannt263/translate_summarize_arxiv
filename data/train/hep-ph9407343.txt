    "<S> as is well known , despite the fact that final predictions of a quantum field theory for physical quantities should be independent of choice of the renormalization scheme , the results obtained with the truncated perturbation series may be numerically different in different schemes . </S>",
    "<S> although the difference is formally of higher order in the coupling constant , numerically it may be significant in the phenomenological analysis . </S>",
    "<S> this effect complicates somewhat comparison of the theoretical predictions with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> there has been a lively discussion on the problem of a proper choice of the rs @xcite .    however , the problem of a proper choice of the rs is only one of the aspects of the rs dependence effect . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the rs dependence of perturbative predictions , instead of being an annoying complication , may also become a source of an important information . </S>",
    "<S> the idea is to estimate the strength of the rs dependence , and to use it as a measure of reliability of perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , we expect the perturbative expression to be less reliable when the expansion coefficients are large and/or when the coupling constant is not very small . </S>",
    "<S> these are precisely the conditions under which we expect also a strong rs dependence of perturbative predictions .    a procedure that is frequently used to estimate the strength of the rs dependence consists of calculating the variation of predictions when the renormalization scale is changed in some reasonable range . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , in the next - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) approximation the freedom of choice of rs is parametrized by _ two _ independent parameters , so that varying the renormalization scale we scan only a small subset of all the available schemes . </S>",
    "<S> also , as has been discussed for example in @xcite , the concept of a `` reasonable '' renormalization scale is not well defined .    </S>",
    "<S> a more general approach was formulated in @xcite , in which full freedom of choice of the rs is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is based on the observation that in nnlo one may select acceptable schemes using the expression for a rs invariant combination of the expansion coefficients . in this note </S>",
    "<S> the ideas presented in @xcite are further developed . </S>",
    "<S> a precise mathematical formulation of the constraint eliminating the unnatural schemes is given , which allows for a quantitative estimate of the strength of rs dependence for any physical observable for which the nnlo corrections are known . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule for polarized structure functions are discussed as an example . </S>",
    "<S> the results obtained for other observables are also briefly summarized @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a nnlo expression for a physical quantity @xmath1 depending on a single energy variable @xmath2 : @xmath3 , \\label{r}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 dentes the renormalization scale , @xmath5 denotes the running coupling constant that satisfies the nnlo renormalization group equation : @xmath6 , \\label{rge}\\ ] ] and where @xmath7 @xmath8 the coefficients @xmath9 are independent of @xmath4 . </S>",

    "<S> is assumed , that the quark mass effects are approximated by a step - function energy dependence of the number of active quark flavors .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of perturbative calculations are usually expressed in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath12 ) scheme @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> other choices of rs are possible , corresponding to different choices of the finite parts of renormalization constants . results in various schemes are related by a finite renormalization , which in our approximation is equivalent to a redefinition of the coupling constant : @xmath13.\\ ] ] the constants @xmath14 and @xmath15 may in principle be arbitrary . </S>",
    "<S> the expansion coefficients @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 depend on the choice of rs . </S>",
    "<S> also the parameter @xmath19 does depend on the rs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant formulas describing this dependence are collected for example in @xcite . however , in nnlo there exists an rs independent combination of the expansion coefficients @xcite : @xmath20 as was pointed out in @xcite , a convenient description of the rs dependence of @xmath21 is obtained when @xmath16 and @xmath18 are chosen as independent parameters characterizing the choice of rs . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath16 controls the degree of freedom in the approximants which is equivalent to the freedom of choice of the renormalization scale @xmath4 , and @xmath18 controls  in the terminology of stevenson @xcite  the dependence on the choice of the renormalization convention . with this parametrization the nnlo rg - improved expression for @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> may be written in the form @xcite : @xmath22 , \\label{impr}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is expressed as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath18 using the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ inv ] . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical value of the running coupling constant is obtained from the implicit equation : @xmath23 where @xmath24 which is obtained by integrating the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ rge ] with an appropriate boundary condition . </S>",
    "<S> the explicit form of @xmath25 may be found for example in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of @xmath26 in the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ intrge ] is a result of taking explicitly into account the one loop celmaster - gonsalves relation between @xmath19 parameters in different schemes @xcite , which is valid to all orders of perturbation expansion .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact , that numerical value of the predictions depends on the choice of rs , stimulated the interest in prescriptions , which pick up schemes distinguished by some arguments of physical or mathematical character . </S>",
    "<S> several such prescriptions for selecting a `` good '' rs have been discussed , like the prinicple of fastest apparent convergence ( fac ) @xcite , the principle of minimal sensitivity ( pms ) @xcite , the momentum subtraction prescription @xcite , and other @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , regardless of our choice of the optimal scheme , there is always a continuum of schemes which are close to the one preferred by us . </S>",
    "<S> since any choice of a preferred rs may have only a heuristic motivation , the predictions obtained in schemes close to the optimal scheme also must be somehow taken into account . a natural way to accomplish </S>",
    "<S> this is to supplement the prediction in a preferred scheme by the estimate of the strength of the scheme dependence .    in order to obtain a meaningful estimate of the strength of rs dependence one </S>",
    "<S> should calculate variation of predictions over all _ a priori _ acceptable schemes . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we must provide some well motivated criteria for selecting the admissible scheme . </S>",
    "<S> the use of some selection criteria can not be avoided , because by taking variation of predictions over _ all _ possible schemes we would obtain a meaningless result . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this is obvious  </S>",
    "<S> clearly one may make a bad choice of scheme , in which the perturbation expansion could have unnaturally large expansion coefficients , and one may artificially obtain very large higher order corrections and very strong rs dependence , without any physical significance . as was pointed out in @xcite , in order to eliminate unnatural schemes one may use the expression for the rs invariant @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> this invariant appears as an nnlo expansion coefficient in the manifestly rs - invariant evolution equation for a physical quantity @xcite , and therefore it may be taken as a natural rs - independent characterization of the magnitude of the nnlo corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the observation made in @xcite was that one should avoid using schemes that introduce large cancellations in the expression for @xmath27 .    to make this condition more concrete let us introduce a function which describes the degree of cancellation in the expression for @xmath27 in a quantitative way : @xmath28 the requirement , that the contributions to @xmath27 should not be too large compared to the magnitude of @xmath27 itself , </S>",
    "<S> may be now written in the form : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is some constant . </S>",
    "<S> the constant @xmath31 determines how strong cancellations in the expression for @xmath27 we want to allow . for arbitrary @xmath31 </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to obtain an explicit description of the region of allowed parameters in the @xmath32 plane . in the case </S>",
    "<S> @xmath33 , which is what will be needed for the bjorken sum rule , let us define : @xmath34/2,\\\\ c_{2}^{min}= - \\rho_{2}(l-1)/2,\\\\ c_{2}^{max}= \\rho_{2}(l+1)/2,\\\\ c_{2}^{int}= c_{1}r_{1}^{min}+c_{2}^{max}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath35 the region of allowed parameters is bounded from above by the line joining the points @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 . for @xmath41 the region of allowed parameters </S>",
    "<S> is bounded from below by the lines : @xmath42 it is interesting that the fac scheme , corresponding to @xmath43 , @xmath44 , always belongs to the allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> we also see , that for @xmath45  i.e. null nnlo correction  the only scheme satisfying eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ constraint ] is @xmath43 , @xmath46 ( and of course @xmath47 ) .    for a final specification of the allowed region in the @xmath32 plane </S>",
    "<S> we have to choose some value of @xmath31 in the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ constraint ] . to make a meaningful choice </S>",
    "<S> let us observe , that it is a rather natural requirement to have the pms scheme in the allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> the pms scheme parameters are determined by the condition : @xmath48 an approximate solution of these quations has the form @xcite : @xmath49 it is easy to see that taking @xmath50 we would have the pms scheme right at the boundary of the allowed region in the @xmath32 plane .    therefore , in order to have an estimate of the strength of the scheme dependence in nnlo we propose to calculate the variation of predictions using eq .  </S>",

    "<S> let us now consider the qcd correction @xmath51 to the bjorken sum rule for the polarized structure functions in the deep - inelastic scattering @xcite : @xmath52= \\frac{1}{6 } \\frac{g_{a}}{g_{v}}[1-r_{bj}(q^{2})].\\ ] ] this sum rule has been recently a subject of intense experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigation . </S>",
    "<S> the qcd perturbation expansion for @xmath51 has the form of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ r ] , with @xmath53 , where the expansion coefficients in the @xmath54 scheme with four quark flavors are given by @xcite : @xmath55 together with @xmath56 , @xmath57 this implies @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) . in figure 1 </S>",
    "<S> we show @xmath60 as a function of @xmath16 and @xmath18 for @xmath61 ( this corresponds to @xmath62  as used by the smc collaboration to present the combined experimental data @xcite  and @xmath63 as preferred by the particle data group @xcite ) , together with the region of allowed values for the scheme parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we see that @xmath60 has indeed a saddle point , representing prediction in the pms scheme , close to the @xmath50 allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> we have : @xmath64 the estimate of the strength of the scheme dependence is obtained by comparing the predictions inside the allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the extremal values are attained at the boundary of the allowed region : @xmath65 for comparison we also show in figure  1 the range of scheme parameters satisfying the constraint given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ constraint ] with @xmath66 , in which case a small neighbourhood of the pms parameters is taken into account . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath67    in figure  2 we show the prediction for @xmath60 as a function of @xmath68 near the point @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> this figure shows how the uncertainty of the predictions arising from the rs dependence may affect the fit of @xmath69 to possible experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the obtained scheme dependence appears to be very small . </S>",
    "<S> in fact it is much smaller than the uncertainty arising from the estimated error in the fitted value of @xmath69  the particle data group gives @xmath70 , which for @xmath71 gives variation of @xmath72 in the range @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme dependence uncertainty is also much smaller than the experimental errors in the presently available experimental data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the @xmath74 nnlo formula for the qcd corrections to the polarized bjorken sum rule seems to be a potentially good source of precise information on @xmath69 once the experimental accuracy is improved .    </S>",
    "<S> let us also note that the @xmath54 coefficients lie outside the allowed region indicated in figure  1 , i.e.  in our approach the @xmath54 scheme has to be considered as a scheme with unnaturally large expansion coefficients . also , @xmath75 lies outside the range of values obtained in our estimate of scheme dependence uncertainties . however , the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 is still rather small for @xmath78 close to @xmath79 .    for the sake of comparison </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to consider the rs dependence of the nnlo expression for @xmath51 for @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> taking three quark flavors we have : @xmath81 which together with @xmath82 and @xmath83 implies @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a significantly larger value than for four flavors . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of @xmath60 on @xmath16 and @xmath18 for @xmath80 for @xmath61 is shown in figure  3 . </S>",
    "<S> we find : @xmath86 repeating the procedure used for @xmath74 we obtain for the @xmath50 allowed region : @xmath87 for the @xmath66 allowed region we find : @xmath88 note that also in this case the @xmath54 coefficients lie outside the allowed range for scheme parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath89 , which is close to the lower limit of values obtained by varying over the @xmath66 allowed region . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath80 formula is larger than in the @xmath74 formula . </S>",
    "<S> this is a result of stronger dependence of @xmath21 on the scheme parameters in this case , and of the larger range of parameters which may be considered to be natural . using our method </S>",
    "<S> we may now quantitatively compare reliability of the @xmath80 and @xmath74 predictions for @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> concerning the energy dependence of the theoretical uncertainties in this case let us note , that for lower values of @xmath72 the rs dependence of the three - flavor expression , estimated according to our prescription , is considerably larger than that found above . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of the low energy behavior of @xmath60 and a possible method for reducing scheme dependence at low energies would be discussed in a separate note @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude this note with several remarks .    </S>",
    "<S> \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> it has to be emphasized that our estimate of the strength of the rs dependence does not provide an error estimate in the mathematical sense , i.e.  there is no theorem that would guarantee that the true result lies within the obtained range of variation for the prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the method described above provides only a consistent framework for making an unbiased educated guess about possible theoretical precision of the prediction . </S>",
    "<S> the method avoids unnecessary constraints on the considered renormalization schemes , it eliminates from analysis the unnatural schemes , and it is sensitive to the magnitude of the nnlo correction via dependence on @xmath27 . the estimate of the scheme dependence uncertainty obtained in this way should be particularly useful for a quantitative comparison of reliability of perturbative predictions for different physical quantities , evaluated at different energies . </S>",
    "<S> in fact one may reasonably expect that thus obtained _ relative _ estimate of the reliability of perturbative predictions would be insensitive to certain freedom in choosing @xmath31 in the eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ constraint ] and to possible variations in the choice of the function @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed method should be also useful in determining the regions of applicability of perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since we have taken great care to eliminate schemes with unnaturally large expansion coefficients , in order to avoid introducing any spurious rs dependence , then any large variation of predictions obtained according to our method would be an unambiguous sign of a limited applicability of the nnlo expression in the considered energy range .    </S>",
    "<S> \\2 . </S>",
    "<S> the rs invariant @xmath27 plays a fundamental role in our approach . however , stevenson in his anlysis of rs dependence @xcite used an expression for the nnlo invariant that differs from the one used here by a constant . </S>",
    "<S> we think that the expression used in this note is more natural for characterization of the magnitude of nnlo corrections because it appears in the rs invariant evolution equation for a physical quantity @xcite . to emphasize the rs independent character of the evolution equation obtained in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> let us recall the argument indicated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> let us take @xmath21 as given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ r ] in _ arbitrary _ scheme , differentiate over @xmath2 , then express @xmath91 in terms of @xmath21 , and finally express @xmath92 as a series expansion in @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain : @xmath93.\\ ] ] the first three expansion coefficients in this equation are rs independent and coincide with the coefficients obtained in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> higher order expansion coefficients in this equation are scheme dependent , which is a result of the fact that we have only used nnlo approximation for a physical quantity . </S>",
    "<S> ( if higher order approximant would be taken , then more coefficients in the above equation would become independent of the choice of rs . ) </S>",
    "<S> this shows , that the equation obtained in @xcite is indeed rs independent , and that it is not a result of a particular choice of the scheme .    </S>",
    "<S> another argument supporting our choice is the fact that @xmath27 naturally appears in the leading order solution of the pms equations ( eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ apms ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> \\3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we base our method on the existence of the rs invariant @xmath27 has an obvious consequence , that it can not be applied to quantities for which only next - to - leading ( nlo ) corrections are known . this should not be surprising however , because the nlo approximation has a rather special status in qcd . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the nlo correction allows only to set the proper energy scale for the prediction . </S>",
    "<S> for example , using the fac scheme we obtain in nlo an _ identical _ energy dependence for _ all _ possible physical observables depending on one energy variable , except for a shift on a logarithmic energy scale . </S>",
    "<S> it is only at nnlo that physical quantities receive process - specific corrections . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural that only at nnlo and beyond one may test reliability of the perturbation expansion . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a fundamental importance of the nnlo calculations for a proper comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> let us also note that it is straightforward to extend our approach to the case of four - loop or even higher order corrections if such calculations would ever be done .    </S>",
    "<S> \\4 . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss some other methods of estimating the reliability of perturbative predictions . </S>",
    "<S> a simplest alternative is to compare nlo and nnlo predictions , taking the difference as an estimate of the theoretical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , it is obvious that such an estimate would be strongly dependent on the choice of scheme . </S>",
    "<S> one may also try to guess the magnitude of higher order corrections . </S>",
    "<S> again , the problem here is the rs dependence of such an approach . </S>",
    "<S> note also that the asymptotic expression for higher order corrections obtained in @xcite , which has been sometimes used to evaluate the theoretical uncertainty , is known to be erroneous @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in @xcite it is proposed to obtain theoretical uncertainty by comparing predictions obtained in the pms , fac and @xmath12 schemes . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , this method also may give misleading results , since the predictions in the pms and fac approach are known to lie rather close to each other regardless of the magnitude of the nnlo correction , and the choice of @xmath12 in such procedure is completely arbitrary , without any theoretical or phenomenological motivation . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , as was shown above , comparing pms and @xmath12 we may obtain _ larger _ uncertainty than that suggested by our method .    </S>",
    "<S> \\5 . </S>",
    "<S> the method described in this note has been applied to other quantities for which the nnlo expansion is known @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the results for the gross - llewellyn - smith sum rule are similar to those obtained above for the bjorken sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> the nnlo expression for @xmath74 appears to have small scheme uncertainty , while the @xmath94 expression seems to be less precise , particularly at lower energies .    in the case of the qcd corrections to the tau lepton decay </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the observations made in @xcite . by varying predictions over the set of schemes allowed by the constraint given by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ constraint ] we find that the frequently used nnlo perturbative expression is unstable against the change of rs . </S>",
    "<S> ( in @xcite the condition on the allowed schemes was not specified in a quantitative way . ) </S>",
    "<S> however , if one takes a contour integral representation for @xmath95 , one obtains a stable result @xcite , with theoretical uncertainty of the same order as the present experimental uncertainty . neglecting nonperturbative contributions for simplicity and fitting @xmath69 to the experimental central value @xmath96 </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath97 in the generalized pms method , and @xmath98 variation for the @xmath50 allowed region for the scheme parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> application of our method to the case of the @xmath99 qcd corrections to the @xmath100 annihilation into hadrons reveals a surprisingly large rs dependence , despite rather high characteristic energy scale . the large scheme uncertainty is a consequence of a large value of the rs invariant @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> however , a closer analysis shows that large value of this invariant is due mainly to the effect of analytic continuation from the spacelike to timelike momenta . a proper treatment of the analytic continuation results in a considerable improvement of the stability of the predictions with respect to change of the rs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar remarks apply to the case of the qcd corrections to the @xmath101-boson decay rate to hadrons , which is however more complicated because of the presence of mass dependent corrections .    summarizing , we may say , that a method has been proposed for analyzing the uncertainties in the nnlo predictions , introduced by arbitrariness in the choice of the renormalization scheme . </S>",
    "<S> this method is based on a condition that eliminates schemes which have expansion coefficients giving unnaturally large cancellations in the expression for the characteristic nnlo rs invariant . </S>",
    "<S> application of the method has been illustrated using as an example the qcd corrections to the bjorken sum rule for polarized structure functions . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that for four quark flavors these corrections have small scheme dependence uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> our considerations show the fundamental importance of the nnlo corrections for a proper evaluation of the perturbative qcd predictions .    </S>",
