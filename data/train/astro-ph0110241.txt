    "dwarf novae are a class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , which are close binary systems consisting of a white dwarf and a red dwarf secondary transferring matter via the roche lobe overflow .",
    "the resultant accretion disk around the white dwarf is susceptible to various kinds of instabilities , and is a source of a rich variety of activities in cvs .",
    "the two most relevant instabilities are thermal and tidal instabilities , which are responsible for dwarf nova - type outbursts and superhumps , respectively [ see @xcite for a review ] .",
    "systems having both low mass - transfer rates ( @xmath5 ) and low mass ratios ( @xmath6 ) are susceptible to both thermal and tidal instabilities , and are called su uma - type dwarf novae [ for a recent review of su uma - type stars and their observational properties , see @xcite ] . among su uma - type dwarf novae , there exists a small subgroup of wz sge - type dwarf novae [ originally proposed by @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite lists two dwarf novae , wx cet and uz boo , which show very infrequent and large - amplitude outbursts , similar to those observed in wz sge .",
    "wz sge , itself , has a number of peculiar properties ( e.g. the longest observed recurrence time of 33 years and the lack of normal outbursts ) among dwarf novae .",
    "the wz sge - type phenomenon has been a long - standing problem , and several hypotheses have been proposed .",
    "two historically representative ones are @xcite and @xcite ; the former assumed extremely low quiescent viscosity , and the latter assumed the evaporation of the inner disk .",
    "modern views on these theoretical models can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since wx cet was selected as one of two relatives to wz sge by @xcite , this star has been receiving much attention .",
    "@xcite observed the 1989 june superoutburst of wx cet , and detected superhumps with a period of @xmath780 m. @xcite argued , from a similarity of photometric and spectroscopic features of wx cet to other su uma - type dwarf novae , that there is no clear reason to retain the distinction between wz sge - type stars and other su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "however , even if the argument by @xcite against the clear observational separation of wz sge - type dwarf novae and su uma - type dwarf novae is partly supported by recent observations of other stars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , the 1989 june superoutburst of wx cet was observed only under unfavorable seasonal condition , which made any detailed observation and analysis difficult .",
    "@xcite performed a radial - velocity study in quiescence , and obtained a most probable orbital period ( @xmath8 ) of 79.16(4 ) min . @xcite",
    "performed ccd photometry of the 1991 superoutburst , which again occurred in an unfavorable seasonal condition , and found that the rate of decline remarkably slowed down during the latter course of the superoutburst .",
    "@xcite suggested some similarities to superoutbursts of wz sge , itself .",
    "more recently , @xcite observed wx cet in quiescence , and obtained a photometric period of 0.05827(2 ) d , which is in good agreement with the spectroscopic orbital period by @xcite . @xcite further noted that the orbital light curve showed alternations between single- and double - hump profiles , as in wz sge in quiescence .",
    "these observations have thus shown some degree of resemblance to wz sge in certain aspects . since all of the available observations during previous superoutbursts only covered limited stages of superoutbursts , further observations of a superoutburst in a more favorable condition , which is expected to provide a more discriminative information about its suggested wz sge - type nature ,",
    "have long been waited .",
    "the 1998 november superoutburst @xcite was such a long - waited outburst .",
    "the initial detection by @xcite was done on 1998 november 10 , at a visual magnitude of 11.8 , and our observation started within 1 d of the initial detection .",
    "the overall course of the outburst was followed in detail by the present observation .",
    "the ccd observations were carried out at three observatories : kyoto , tsukuba , and okayama .",
    "the kyoto observations were done using an unfiltered st-7 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt  cassegrain telescope .",
    "the exposure time was 30 s. the images were dark - subtracted , flat - fielded , and analyzed using the java@xmath9-based aperture and psf photometry package developed by one of the authors ( tk ) .",
    "the tsukuba observations were done using an @xmath10 filtered bitran bt-20 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt  cassegrain telescope .",
    "the exposure time was 60180 s. the images were analyzed using the mira a / p aperture photometry package .",
    "the okayama observations were made using a @xmath11-filtered st-7 camera attached to the meade 25-cm schmidt  cassegrain telescope .",
    "the exposure time was 1520 s. the images were analyzed using a microcomputer - based aperture photometry package originally developed by one of the authors ( tk ) and improved by km .",
    "all observatories used gsc 5851.965 ( tycho-2 magnitude @xmath11=10.59@xmath10.05 , @xmath12=+0.67@xmath10.09 ) as the primary comparison star , whose constancy was confirmed using several fainter check stars in the same ccd images .",
    "the magnitudes of wx cet were determined relative to gsc 5851.965 .",
    "barycentric corrections to observed times were applied before the following analysis .",
    "a failure of the clock adjustment was found in the kyoto november 18 observation .",
    "a retrospective fine adjustment was made by maximizing the cross - correlation with the simultaneously taken tsukuba data .",
    "the zero - point accuracy of the observed times of the kyoto november 18 data is thus considered to be @xmath71 m.    since each observer used a different filter , we first added a constant to each set of observations in order to obtain a common magnitude scale , which was adjusted to the most abundant kyoto data .",
    "the constants were chosen to maximize the cross - correlation after the correction ( table [ tab : offset ] ) . since outbursting dwarf novae",

    "it is not surprising that early superhumps are the most discriminative feature of wz sge - type dwarf novae , since the long - lasting , large - amplitude superoutbursts of wz sge - type dwarf novae are regarded as a necessary consequence of a combination of low mass - transfer rates and the effective removal of the innermost accretion disk , which leads to an expansion of the accretion disk , eventually reaching the tidal instability ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . from the lack of a clear signature of early superhumps , we consider wx cet to be a fairly normal su uma - type dwarf nova with a large outburst amplitude , rather than a wz sge - type dwarf nova .",

    "this phenomenon may be an exemplification of a gradual decay of the disk viscosity , which determines the luminosity of the disk .",
    "following @xcite , we suspect that the ignition of thermal instability accidentally failed to occur under competition with the decay of viscosity in the present post - superoutburst state of wx cet .",
    "the post - superoutburst decline of wx cet was almost perfectly linear ( exponential ) , with a rate of 0.10 mag d@xmath4 .",
    "interestingly , this rate of decline is almost perfectly identical with the mean rate of decline ( 0.10 mag d@xmath4 ) during the plateau stage .",
    "although this coincidence may be merely accidental , this may suggest the existence of a time scale for the decay of the disk viscosity related to the decay of the superoutburst plateau .",
    "we observed the 1998 november superoutburst of wx cet , a dwarf nova which had been proposed to be a related system to the peculiar dwarf nova wz sge .",
    "the observation established that wx cet is an su uma - type dwarf nova with a mean superhump period of 0.05949(1 ) d. this period is 2.1% longer than the reported orbital period .",
    "this fractional superhump excess lies between those of extreme wz sge - type systems and those of other su uma - type systems .",
    "the lack of early superhumps at the earliest stage of superoutburst , together with the rapid development of usual superhumps , seems to disqualify wx cet as being a wz sge - type dwarf nova .",
    "a period increase of superhumps with @xmath0 = + 8.5@xmath11.0 @xmath2 10@xmath3 was observed during the superoutburst plateau .",
    "this is one of the largest @xmath0 ever observed in su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "although there was no evidence of a post - superoutburst rebrightening , a linear decline , with a rate of 0.10 mag d@xmath4 , was observed in the post - superoutburst stage .",
    "this may be an exemplification of the proposed decay of quiescent viscosity following the superoutburst .",
    "we are grateful to many amateur observers for supplying their vital visual and ccd estimates via vsnet , and especially to rod stubbings for his detection and early notification of the long - awaited superoutburst .",
    "part of this work is supported by a research fellowship of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists ( km ) ."
