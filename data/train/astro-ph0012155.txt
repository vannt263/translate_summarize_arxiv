    "it has long been suspected that the most luminous agn are powered by accretion of matter onto massive black holes ( mbh ) .",
    "this belief , combined with the observed evolution of the space - density of agn ( van der marel 1999 and references therein ) and the high incidence of low luminosity nuclear activity in nearby galaxies ( ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ) , implies that a significant fraction of luminous galaxies must host black holes of mass @xmath2m@xmath3 .",
    "it is now clear that a large fraction of hot spheroids contain a mbh ( e.g. harms et al .  1994 ;",
    "macchetto et al .  1997 ; van der marel et al .  1998 ; richstone et al .  1998 ) .",
    "moreover , there is a suggestion in the data that the hole mass is proportional to the mass ( or luminosity ) of the host spheroid .",
    "quantitatively , @xmath4 ( e.g. richstone et al .",
    "this relation is still controversial , however , both because the sensitivity of published searches is correlated with bulge luminosity , and because there is substantial scatter in @xmath5 at fixed @xmath6 .",
    "recently ferrarese & merrit ( 2000 ) and gebhardt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have shown that a tighter correlation holds between the bh mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge .",
    "clearly , any correlation of black hole and spheroid properties would have important implications for theories of galaxy formation in general , and bulge formation in particular .    to date the majority of bh detections have taken place in luminous , early - type systems , and most of the data for spirals come either from studies of water masers , or are for nearby spirals in which a mbh can be detected through stellar dynamics . a more systematic study of spiral galaxies is clearly needed at this stage",
    "prompted by the above motivations , we are undertaking a comprehensive survey for mbhs in spiral galaxies , both quiescent and active .",
    "we identified a volume limited sample ( @xmath7km / s ) of 54 sb , sbb , sc , and sbc spiral galaxies from a ground - based study by axon et al .  who obtained h@xmath0 and [ nii ] rotation curves at seeing - limited resolution of 1for 128 spiral galaxies from the rc3 catalogue .",
    "the selected spiral galaxies are known to have nuclear gas disks and span wide ranges in bulge mass and concentration .",
    "the low redshift cut - off was chosen to ensure a high spatial resolution on source in order to detect even low - mass mbhs .",
    "the frequency of agn in our sample is typical of that found in other surveys of nearby spirals , with comparable numbers of weak nuclear radio sources and liners .",
    "the main aim of our survey is to verify if the correlations of the bh mass with bulge mass and velocity dispersion ( richstone et al .",
    "1998 , ferrarese & merrit 2000 , gebhardt et al .  2000 ) also hold for spiral galaxies .",
    "recently , it has been shown that hierarchical galaxy formation models can account for these correlations ( haehnelt & kauffmann 2000 ) . if massive spheroids form by hierarchical merging , then the growth of mbhs may be also a hierarchical process .",
    "small spheroids have undergone less mergers and are thus expected to have smaller bhs .",
    "thus , the above correlations may hold the key to testing these ideas about galaxy evolution . furthermore",
    ", one would like to compare the bh mass with other galaxy properties such as the shape of the nuclear light profiles ; a comparison with agn activity hosted in the galaxy would provide constraints on the efficiency of accretion .",
    "for each galaxy , we obtain three medium resolution spectra with stis and the g750 m grating centered on h@xmath0 using the 01 or 02 slit . the resolution is thus @xmath8 or 3000 respectively .",
    "the spectra are taken for three parallel slit positions , with the central one centered on the galaxy nucleus and the other two offset by @xmath9 .",
    "the reason for this choice is explained in fig .  1 .",
    "in order to remove cosmic rays and hot pixels , we obtain two exposures for each slit position with the object shifted by an integer number of detector pixels along the slit .",
    "the use of hst guarantees a spatial resolution of about 01 which corresponds to 10pc on a galaxy at a distance of 20 mpc .",
    "we currently have hst / stis data for 90% of the sample and have extracted rotation curves for these galaxies . generally , the rotation curves show a steep nuclear rise to a long plateau . in several cases",
    "the nuclear rotation curve presents the characteristic unresolved s - shaped velocity structure expected for keplerian rotation around a mass concentration ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this dynamical signature is accompanied by an abrupt increase of the emission line brightness toward the center , indicative of the presence of a well defined morphological structure , very likely a rotating circumnuclear disk .",
    "comparison with the stellar brightness profiles derived from the stis acquisition images yields stringent lower limits on the m / l ratios that strongly suggest the presence of a supermassive black hole . to interpret the observed rotation curves we have software in place to calculate and fit to the data the predictions of thin disk models with circular rotation ( e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "2000 ; van der marel & van den bosch 1998 ) .    as an example",
    ", we now focus on ngc 4041 , which clearly shows the possibilities of this project .",
    "ngc 4041 is at a distance of about 20 mpc .",
    "the rotation curve shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the s - shaped signature of a rotating disk of @xmath10 pc radius .",
    "note the small velocity amplitude of the rotation curve which is about 40 km / s peak to peak . assuming an edge - on disk with the line of nodes parallel to the slit one can infer that the minimum dynamical mass required to explain the data is @xmath11m@xmath12 .",
    "this mass estimate takes into account the `` smearing '' of the rotation curve due to the finite slit size and instrumental point spread function .",
    "this low mass value gives an indication of the lowest masses which can be detected with our project .",
    "the inferred dynamical mass for ngc 4041 should be considered an upper limit to the mass of a possible mbh , since the nuclear star cluster in this galaxy may be responsible for all or part of the dynamically inferred mass ."
