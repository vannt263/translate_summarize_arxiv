    "near infrared ( nir ) surveys , such as 2mass , denis , and sdss ( with its @xmath8-band capability ) , have resulted in a rapid increase in our knowledge of the properties of stars .",
    "this is particularly true for the late m , l and t spectral types , collectively known as utracool dwarfs ( ucds , @xcite ) . today we know of more than 600 l and t dwarfs .",
    "despite these discoveries , we still do not have a clear understanding of how molecular cloud material assembles itself into such relatively low mass objects and fundamental properties such as temperature , age and mass remain coarsely determined .",
    "binary star systems are a crucial tool for addressing both of these issues .",
    "ucd binaries allow us to directly measure the masses , and possibly the radii , of these objects and constrain theoretical models of the structure and emergent flux ( i.e. @xcite ) . even without determining absolute ages , assuming that the components of a binary have identical ages can provide constraints on atmospheric models through estimates of the luminosity ratios .",
    "different formation scenarios make varied predictions for the statistical properties of ucd binary systems ( see @xcite for an overview ) . as a result ,",
    "studying the properties of ucd binaries may shed light on the formation mechanism of the entire class of objects .",
    "although models of field l and t dwarfs have reached a high degree of sophistication , model spectra , particularly for l dwarfs , are highly dependent upon the assumed cloud model .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that changes in the assumed degree of cloud sedimentation could alter the derived effective temperature , @xmath9 , by up to several hundred kelvin and the log of the surface gravity , @xmath10 , by 0.5 dex .",
    "a spectroscopic binary offers the prospect of constrained masses and coevality and would provide excellent simultaneous constraints on the cloud model , object masses , and effective temperatures @xcite .    the binarity of ucds has been studied both spectroscopically and with direct imaging .",
    "relative to main sequence stars ( i.e. @xcite ) , the ucd binaries are more rare , lie at closer separations , and are more likely to have components with equal masses ( @xcite and references therein ) . owing to the difficulties in detecting close , high contrast ratio binaries , imaging surveys do not provide a clear picture of ucd binarity at separations less than 1 au ( see @xcite ) . despite these difficulties , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite",
    "have used high - resolution imaging to determine the orbit of young l or m dwarf binaries .",
    "the binaries with small separations are more readily detectable by searching for the radial velocity signal due to the reflex motion of the primary star .",
    "spectroscopic searches for ucd binaries have identified several binaries and candidate binaries @xcite , though the total number of observations of each object tends to be small .",
    "recent work by @xcite has demonstrated that low - resolution spectra alone can be used to detect the faint companions by searching for the subtle signature of the cooler object at the wavelengths of certain molecular features .",
    "we presented results from a pilot study targeting nine field l dwarfs with the phoenix instrument on gemini - s in @xcite . here , we report the detection of a single - lined ucd spectroscopic binary ( sb1 ) with an orbital separation of approximately 0.4 au . 2massj03202839@xmath110446358 ( hereafter 2m0320@xmath1104 ) was included in the catalog of nearby , cool stars presented by @xcite who spectroscopically classified it as a possible m8 dwarf based on optical spectra .",
    "@xcite classified the object as an l0.5 dwarf based on low resolution nir spectroscopy . in ",
    "2 we describe the high - resolution nir spectroscopy of 2m0320@xmath1104 , in  3 we describe the modeling process used to extract radial velocities from these data , the fit of a keplerian orbit to the radial velocities , and the search for the spectral lines of the secondary , and in  4 we describe the implications of this discovery for future studies of ucds .",
    "we observed 2m0320@xmath1104 with the nirspec spectrograph @xcite on the keck telescope on 14 nights between september 2003 and january 2007 as part of a program to monitor a large sample of l dwarfs for radial velocity variations . in all cases",
    ", we used the same instrumental setup .",
    "this setup was selected to cover the co bandhead and r - branch features around 2.3@xmath12 .",
    "this spectral region is rich in telluric absorption features due to methane . as described in the next section",
    ", these telluric features will serve as the wavelength reference for our radial velocity measurements .",
    "we used a 3 pixel ( 0.432@xmath13 ) slit , with the n7 blocking filter , to produce an approximate scale of 0.3   pixel @xmath1 and a resolution of @xmath14 .",
    "the extracted spectra contain 1000 pixels and cover the approximate spectral range 2.285@xmath12 to 2.318@xmath12 .",
    "exposures ranged from 900s to 1200s per nod position with adjustments made according to observing conditions in order to maintain approximately constant s / n .",
    "the data were gathered in nod pairs so as to facilitate the subtraction of sky emission lines . in total , we collected 16 nod pairs .",
    "after subtraction of the nod pairs to remove sky emission lines , we extracted the spectra following the optimal extraction procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "we modeled the extracted spectra following a procedure similar to that described in @xcite .",
    "our model begins with two high - resolution template spectra : one for the earth s atmosphere and one for the l dwarf .",
    "the high - resolution ( @xmath15 pixel@xmath1 ) spectrum of the earth s atmosphere is provided by @xcite .",
    "the high - resolution synthetic spectra of l dwarfs were computed as described in @xcite , with a number of improvements to be described in a future publication .",
    "the models apply the condensation cloud model of @xcite with a sedimentation parameter of @xmath16 , corresponding to a moderate amount of condensate settling .",
    "the models used here have solar metallicity @xcite , use the opacities described in @xcite , and a fixed gravity of @xmath17 ( cgs ) and cover a range of @xmath9 from 1200 to 2400@xmath18k .",
    "the synthetic spectra provide monochromatic fluxes spaced @xmath19 m apart .",
    "we convolve and re - sample the product of the telluric and l dwarf high - resolution spectra to generate the model that we then fit to the extracted 1-d spectra .",
    "our model has several free parameters .",
    "the parameters related to the l dwarf are the projected rotation velocity of the l dwarf ( @xmath20 ) where @xmath21 indicates the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight , its @xmath22 , and its radial velocity .",
    "the parameters related to the spectrograph are the psf width , flux normalization , and the wavelength solution ( i.e. the mapping from wavelength to pixel position ) .    for the parameters of the l dwarf we first determined a best initial fit with @xmath23 km s@xmath1 using the l dwarf spectral template with @xmath24k using least squares fitting .",
    "this spectral template provided the best overall fit to the data and is also consistent with the l0 spectral type @xcite .",
    "we modeled the wavelength solution as a third - order polynomial , the overall flux normalization as a third - order polynomial , and the spectrograph psf as a single gaussian .",
    "the psf is expected to be asymmetric at some level , and to vary across the spectrograph order .",
    "spectral models that accommodate these subtleties may yield even higher precision than that achieved here . with the @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath22 fixed the model has a total of ten free parameters .",
    "for each spectrum , we determined the best fit values for each parameter , including the radial velocity , using the _ amoeba _ algorithm .",
    "an example of a nirspec spectrum and best fit model is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the algorithm failed to converge on a solution for one out of 28 spectra , resulting in a total of 27 radial - velocity measurements .",
    "visual inspection of this spectrum indicated a strong flux gradient across the order , likely due to a poor extraction .",
    "we used a bootstrap simulation to estimate the error on the individual radial velocities , similar to the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we simulated nirspec observations of l dwarfs with different s / n and radial velocities and used our modeling procedure to estimate our ability to recover the known radial velocity .",
    "since the nirspec data are of relatively high s / n ( @xmath25 per pixel ) , and the v@xmath26 is a modest 16.5 km s@xmath1 , the results of our simulation indicate that the statistical errors on the radial velocities should be rather small ( @xmath25 m s@xmath1 ) .",
    "the measured radial velocities are listed in table 1 .    an initial search for periodicity in the radial velocities with",
    "the lomb - scargle periodogram revealed a clear signal with a period @xmath27d , prompting a more detailed analysis .",
    "the radial velocities covering nearly 5 cycles of the binary were fit with a keplerian orbital model using standard non - linear least - squares techniques .",
    "the six parameters of this model are the period , @xmath28 , the systemic velocity , @xmath29 , the radial velocity semi - amplitude , @xmath30 , the eccentricity , @xmath31 , the time of periastron passage , @xmath32 , and the longitude of periastron , @xmath33 .",
    "the scatter in the fit was found to be significantly larger than the internal uncertainties , possibly as a result of systematic errors .",
    "for the final fit we adjusted the internal errors by adding 0.32  in quadrature to the error estimates based on the bootstrap simulations , so as to force a reduced @xmath34 value near unity .",
    "the resulting orbital elements are listed in table  2 , wherein we also state our estimate of the projected semi - major axis of the orbit of the primary , @xmath35 , and the observations and orbital fit are shown in figure 2 .",
    "the eccentricity ( @xmath36 ) is small but significant at the 4@xmath37 confidence level .",
    "the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the primary , @xmath38 km s@xmath1 , is 21 times the per - point measurement precision .",
    "based on the estimated spectral type ( m8 to l0.5 ) we can estimate the effective temperature of the primary of 2m0320@xmath1104 if we assume that the light from the secondary is negligible .",
    "@xcite present estimates of @xmath22 as a function of spectral type and from this work we estimate @xmath39k for an assumed age of 3 gyr , in general agreement with our fits to the l dwarf templates . using the models of @xcite to relate @xmath22 to mass at an age of 3 gyr",
    ", we estimate that the primary has a mass @xmath40m@xmath41 .",
    "we can use the mass function derived from the radial - velocity fitting procedure to estimate the mass of the secondary as a function of @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the inclination of the system to our line of sight .",
    "if we assume @xmath44m@xmath41 , and that @xmath45 , then the mass of the secondary is @xmath46 . using the models of @xcite and the work of @xcite ,",
    "the secondary would have @xmath47k with a spectral type of approximately l7 to t3 at the assumed age of 3 gyr . as @xmath42 decreases , the total mass of the system increases , resulting in an observed spectrum that is not dominated by the l0 primary",
    ". this would be inconsistent with observations without requiring that the more massive component of this system be significantly under - luminous .",
    "in particular , values of @xmath48 would result in a secondary star that is more massive , though less luminous , than the primary . while it is possible that @xmath49 and the system presents eclipses , the relatively small value of @xmath50 makes eclipses unlikely . given the constraint @xmath51 the actual probability of observable eclipses is likely somewhat higher .    while we have no direct measure of the age of the system",
    ", it is possible to constrain the age from its kinematics . using the distance estimate of 26.2@xmath52 4.3 pc from @xcite , the proper motion of @xmath53 year@xmath1 @xcite , and our measurement of the radial velocity",
    ", we can calculate the space velocity and u , v , w velocity components following @xcite .",
    "since the parallax of this system is not known , the large error on the distance estimate results in large errors on the kinematic estimates .",
    "we find velocity components [ u , v , w]=[@xmath1162.0@xmath54,@xmath1138.6@xmath55 , @xmath1134.3@xmath56 km s@xmath1 relative to the local standard of rest .",
    "using the age - velocity relation from eqn .",
    "8 of @xcite we estimate an age based on the w velocity of @xmath57 gyr ( 95@xmath58 confidence ) .",
    "it is interesting to consider the detectability of the spectral lines of the secondary in our spectra , which would allow us to estimate directly the mass ratio .",
    "based on the models of @xcite , the expected @xmath59-band flux ratio for objects of these masses is @xmath60 at @xmath61gyr and @xmath62 at @xmath63gyr . while detecting the secondary lines at the later age would be challenging , methods like todcor @xcite have been used to recover secondaries in systems with flux ratios @xmath64 ( d. latham ; private communication ) . following a method",
    "similar to todcor we searched for the spectral lines of the secondary as follows .",
    "using the orbital solution presented in table 2 , we searched a grid in two parameters ; the mass of the secondary and the @xmath59-band flux ratio . at each grid point , a second theoretical template spectrum with @xmath65k was added to the fitting procedure described in section 3 .",
    "the v @xmath26 of the secondary was assumed to be the same as that of the primary . during this process",
    "the radial velocity of the primary of 2m0320@xmath1104 was fixed to the value from the orbital solution , the radial velocity of the secondary was also fixed based on the orbital solution and the assumed value of @xmath66 , and the @xmath59-band flux ratio was fixed . at each grid point",
    "this modified modeling scheme was used to determine the best fit of this model to the data .",
    "significant improvements in @xmath34 from the case of a flux ratio of 0.0 would indicate the detection of the secondary component .",
    "we carried out this procedure for a subset of 12 of our spectra gathered near times of quadrature , when the velocity separation of the primary and secondary would likely be greatest .",
    "we found no evidence for the spectral signature of a secondary component with a flux ratio greater than 0.1 in @xmath59 band .",
    "we note that the non - detection of the secondary spectral lines also implies @xmath67",
    ". if @xmath68 the expected flux ratio at @xmath63 gyr would be @xmath69 and the secondary would likely have been detected .",
    "detection of the spectral lines of the secondary and resolution of the system with direct imaging would allow for the first direct measurement of the mass of a field t dwarf .",
    "since the orbital solution combined with direct imaging provides a distance measurement , future observations of this system could also provide important empirical tests of theoretical models for old objects at such low masses .",
    "this work demonstrates the importance of radial velocity searches for binary ucds with small ( @xmath0 au ) separations as a complement to the direct imaging searches for companions at larger separations .",
    "a more detailed analysis of our data , including a more sophisticated model of the individual spectra , may lead to the detection of the spectral lines of the secondary and an estimate of the mass ratio .",
    "if the inclination can also be measured , then the masses of both components may be determined .",
    "if we assume the models of @xcite , @xmath70 , and a distance of 26 pc @xcite , then the maximum angular separation of the pair is @xmath71 mas , below the capabilities of the keck laser guide star ao system . while the flux ratio may be large ( @xmath72 mag , depending on age )",
    ", future interferometric systems may be able to resolve both components and provide the measurement of the inclination required to directly measure the masses of both components .",
