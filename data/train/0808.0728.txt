    "of the many beyond the standard model ( bsm ) theories , supersymmetry ( susy ) is one of the most investigated models .",
    "susy provides a possible solution to the hierarchy problem  @xcite and is a necessary component of string theory .",
    "susy proposes a new symmetry between fermions and bosons that doubles the number of particles .",
    "this symmetry introduces a new multiplicative quantum number , @xmath1-parity ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "supersymmetric particles have @xmath3 , while normal ( non - susy ) particles have @xmath4 .",
    "susy comes in many varieties ( see m.  perelstein s contribution to these proceedings for a review of recent theoretical work ) .",
    "the mechanism responsible for supersymmetry breaking creates many of these variations including msugra ( super - gravity ) , gmsb ( gauge - mediated supersymmetry breaking ) , and amsb ( anomaly - mediated supersymmetry breaking ) .",
    "if @xmath2  is conserved then susy particles must be produced in pairs at the tevatron and cascade down to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) which is stable .",
    "the lsp then becomes a dark matter candidate , simultaneously solving problems in particle physics and astronomy .    at the fermilab tevatron",
    ", supersymmetry has been searched for in a wide variety of channels , some that complement previous lep searches and some that explore completely new territory . here",

    "what is categorized here as `` natural '' susy are models where @xmath2  is conserved and all susy particles ( other than the lsp ) promptly decay .",
    "since astronomical bounds require a stable lsp to be neutral  @xcite , lsp candidates are generally the lightest neutralino ( @xmath5 ) , the sneutrino ( @xmath6 ) or the gravitino ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "the prompt decays ensure that all particles observed directly in the detector are non - supersymmetric and originate from the production vertex .",
    "the lsp will escape the detector without interacting resulting in a missing transverse energy signature .      at hadron colliders ( such as the tevatron ) ,",
    "strong interactions tend to dominate production processes .",
