    "the a@xmath9b@xmath10 and a@xmath11b@xmath12 compounds with transition metal impurities are called diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) .",
    "these systems are interesting both from practical and fundamental points of view .",
    "recently , they have attracted great interest as potential materials for spintronics , the current trend of electronics which manipulates also the spin of the carrier , not only its charge .",
    "the challenge to physicists is the highly correlated subsystem of transition metal ions ( tmi ) demonstrating peculiar interplay of the covalency and of the localized nature of @xmath4-electrons .    usually , the results of optical and electron spin resonance ( esr ) experiments are phenomenologically described@xcite in terms of crystal field ( cf)@xcite theory .",
    "it considers the one - site hamiltonian for the @xmath4-shell of tmi , where coulomb interaction and spin - orbit ( so ) coupling terms are added to one particle cf term of unspecified nature .",
    "the cf interpretation reflects the symmetry of tmi environment , but the values of energetic parameters are taken from experiment , and , thus , say nothing about physical interactions behind them .",
    "it concerns not only the one - particle cf terms : phenomenological reduction factors for racah s coulomb parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 , for the orbital angular momentum , and for the so coupling are always introduced .    within the phenomenological cf theory , the hierarchy of interactions is well established in most complexes containing the transition metal ion surrounded by ligands . for commonly met octahedral and tetrahedral environments",
    ", the cf terms are divided into a large cubic part and much smaller low symmetry terms . for the 3@xmath4 ions the so term is one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the cubic terms . to decide the order of the interaction strength between coulomb forces and cubic cf is much more difficult .",
    "one distinguishes the strong and weak cf cases.@xcite in the strong field approach,@xcite the cubic hamiltonian is diagonalized first , and its eigenfunctions serve as a basis for the subsequent consideration of coulomb and remaining terms . in the weak field approach ,",
    "the many - body eigenfunctions of the single - ion hamiltonian are exposed to the action of cf .",
    "the hartree - fock molecular orbital theory enables to take into account the covalency within the strong field approach.@xcite then , in principle , the calculation of cf parameters becomes possible , the origin of the reduction factors becomes clear and they can be estimated .",
    "we mention here the simple analytic approach proposed in ref . for the cf parameters calculation .",
    "it is based on harrison s parametrization of the electronic structure of solids@xcite and it enables to relate the cf parameters with the structure of the tmi environment .    in the weak field case ,",
    "the account of covalency involves the heitler - london configuration interaction ( ci ) approach.@xcite it is much more complicated as it works with the enlarged hilbert space of many - body functions . on this way",
    ", the description of the dms on the energy scale of the cubic splitting ( @xmath15 ev ) was achieved,@xcite but more fine properties ( such as magnetic anisotropy ) were not obtained , and the relation of ci approach with the phenomenological cf theory was not established .",
    "the a@xmath9b@xmath10 semiconductors crystallize in zincblende or wurtzite structures . in both structures , the tmi substituting for the a site has similar tetrahedral coordination .",
    "the a site has cubic point symmetry in zincblende structure , and trigonal symmetry in wurtzite structure . in cf theory ,",
    "the cubic field of the zincblende structure is described by one parameter @xmath16 , and the trigonal field ( wurtzite structure ) by three parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the deviation from cubic symmetry in wurtzite structure , though small ( @xmath20 ) , has crucial influence on the magnetic properties of tmi .",
    "the co@xmath0 ion in trigonally distorted environment displays a large single - ion magnetic anisotropy , which strongly affects the magnetic properties of co - based dms.@xcite the anisotropy is linear in the trigonal field parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the empirical determination of @xmath18 and @xmath19 is difficult and ambiguous . in optical transitions",
    "they are masked by a large @xmath16 , and various sets give similar description,@xcite their relation with the tmi environment structure remains unclear .",
    "it is thus highly desirable to have a microscopic model that would at least diminish the number of adjustable parameters .",
    "one microscopic model of cf is well known and was the first one that appeared with the cf concept itself .",
    "it is the point charge model ( pcm).@xcite in this model , it is possible to calculate cf both in strong and weak field approaches , but the cf is then strongly underestimated because the hybridization with ligands is neglected .",
    "the authors of ref . have tried to improve the pcm and proposed to modify the tmi @xmath4-function in such a way that it gives the correct value of @xmath16 within the pcm .",
    "in fact , they changed one set of parameters ( cf matrix elements ) to another one ( those describing their slater - type @xmath4-function ) . in order to explain the reduction factors",
    ", they additionally introduced phenomenologically the hybridization with ligands that changes the coulomb and so interactions but does not contribute to the cf splitting .",
    "nevertheless , at present time , any modification of the pcm can not be accepted as a physical model of the tmi in dms .",
    "it is not adequate even for an isolated impurity , e.g. it can not explain the increase of cubic splitting with the increase of covalency .",
    "nor , it can not be the starting point for studies of the interaction of tmi with the host valence band ( @xmath23 exchange ) and between the impurities ( superexchange ) .",
    "both phenomena are due to the virtual hoppings of electrons between ligand and tmi described by the @xmath23 hamiltonian.@xcite    in this work we establish the relation between the configuration interaction ( ci ) approach and the phenomenology of the cf .",
    "below we will show that the many - body perturbation theory gives the possibility to consider the @xmath4-level splitting by covalency in the weak field case at the same level of simplicity and physical transparency as for the pure electrostatic case ( pcm ) .",
    "our final goal is the derivation of the effective low energy spin - hamiltonian , i.e. an effective hamiltonian that describes the ground state manifold response to the applied magnetic field .",
    "we will demonstrate with an example for the @xmath24 ion in tetrahedral coordination that spin hamiltonian may be derived from realistic many - body hamiltonian by means of a set of canonical transformations .    in a first step ,",
    "one eliminates the coupling with ligands : i.e. we pass from realistic @xmath23 hamiltonian to cf - like hamiltonian for @xmath4-ion only ( section ii.a ) .",
    "we find a renormalization ( i.e.reduction ) of coulomb and so parameters ( section ii.b ) .",
    "we generalize the ideas of ref . and give the expressions for cf parameters via @xmath25 hopping and charge transfer energy difference .",
    "it is important to note that these expressions give the connection of cf parameters with the structure of the tmi environment ( section iii ) .    having derived the parameters for the effective cf - like hamiltonian in section iii , we calculate then in a second step the zero - field splitting @xmath6 and the @xmath5-factors , i.e.  the parameters of the low - energy spin - hamiltonian .",
    "the basis for the crystal field hamiltonian of a 3@xmath1 configuration including so coupling has 120 dimensions and will be diagonalized exactly ( details are given in the appendix ) .",
    "it follows that we do not have to worry about the weak field hypothesis for this effective hamiltonian : indeed this procedure is equally valid if cubic splitting @xmath26 and coulomb interaction parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 would be of the same order .    on the other hand , in the given case of zno : co , we can alternatively obtain an analytical closed expression which connects the parameters of the microscopic hamiltonian with the parameters of the effective spin - hamiltonian . for that purpose",
    "we use perturbation theory in the spirit of the weak field scheme .",
    "we construct the many - body basis for a @xmath1 ion ( section iv.a ) and make two subsequent transformations ( section iv.b ) .",
    "the first one takes into account the fact that the cubic splitting is smaller than the remaining coulomb interaction , and the second treats the trigonal coupling as a perturbation . in the final step",
    "we take into account spin - orbit coupling in order to obtain the spin - hamiltonian observed in esr .    in the section v",
    ", we apply our approach to the case of zno : co and we compare the numerical diagonalization results with the perturbative formula finding reasonable agreement .",
    "we compare also our parameter set which was calculated microscopically with the phenomenological parameter sets derived before from optics and esr .",
    "in this section we show that starting from realistic @xmath23 hamiltonian it is possible to derive an effective single - ion hamiltonian .",
    "the latter has the form of a classical crystal field hamiltonian .",
    "the crystal field parameters acquire a clear microscopic meaning and the essential property of being calculable and connected with the structure of the tmi surroundings .",
    "the main point is the large energy separation of configurations @xmath27 and @xmath28 ( respectively @xmath29 electrons in @xmath4-shell of the tmi and @xmath30 @xmath4-electrons plus one hole in the valence band ) , compared with the tmi - ligand hopping.@xcite    the appropriate hamiltonian should be written in the basis of spherically symmetric functions .",
    "the basis should not necessarily coincide with the one for free ions .",
    "a more contracted basis is suitable for solids , e.g.  that one of the fplo method.@xcite without specifying it , we will assume the existence of an orthonormal basis of one - particle spherically symmetric functions localized on lattice sites .",
    "we assume also that it is a minimal basis set , i.e. one radial function suffices for the description of one electronic shell .",
    "the existence of such a basis is not explicitly proved , but there are indirect evidences in favor of it .",
    "first , the fplo method enables to explicitly construct non - orthogonal minimal basis of localized functions .",
    "second , w.a .",
    "harrison succeeded in describing the electronic structure of a huge number of compounds , assuming the existence of such basis , and empirically fitting the hamiltonian matrix elements in this basis.@xcite the hamiltonian may be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are local hamiltonians for the tmi and ligands , respectively , @xmath33 describes electron hoppings between the tmi and ligands . in the superposition model , @xcite the contributions of separate ligands",
    "are superimposed above each other .",
    "further on , we will give a foundation for that rule , following the lines given in ref . .",
    "so , it suffices to consider the ligand at the point @xmath34 .",
    "then , the generalization to another geometry is straightforward .    in the zero - order hamiltonian",
    "we include the diagonal one - particle terms and dominant coulomb interaction @xmath35 where @xmath36 @xmath37 are the one - particle energies of @xmath4 and @xmath3 states , @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the corresponding racah s parameters ; the operator @xmath40 creates an electron with the one - particle basis @xmath41 wave function with angular momentum and spin projections @xmath42 and @xmath43 on the tmi and on the ligand site respectively . in the ground state of @xmath44",
    ", the @xmath4-shell of the tmi contains @xmath29 electrons and the ligand has the closed @xmath3-shell with @xmath45 electrons . the hopping hamiltonian @xmath46 couples configurations with different numbers of @xmath4-electrons .",
    "the most important is the coupling between the configurations @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the hybridization with the conduction band depends on second nearest neighbor @xmath49 hopping matrix element and may be neglected .",
    "in the two center approximation , the hopping @xmath50 ( eq.([tpd ] ) ) is diagonal over the angular momentum projection indices @xmath42 and @xmath51 due to the symmetry with respect to the tmi - ligand axis .",

    "( [ heff ] ) we have taken advantage of the fact that every state of our subspace includes the non - degenerate closed @xmath3-shell of ligand for which @xmath62 and all terms concerning the ligand become constant .",
    "we have obtained an effective single - ion hamiltonian ( eq.([heff ] ) ) where the action of ligand has been reduced to the one - particle crystal field term @xmath63 ( [ hcf ] ) .",

    "( [ trans ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the second order contributions from separate ligands simply sum up when we do subsequent transformations to remove hopping to first order between the tmi and the different ligands of the nearest surroundings .",

    "<S> we present a crystal field theory of transition metal impurities in semiconductors in a trigonally distorted tetrahedral coordination . </S>",
    "<S> we develop a perturbative scheme to treat covalency effects within the weak ligand field case ( coulomb interaction dominates over one - particle splitting ) and apply it to zno : co@xmath0 ( 3@xmath1 ) . using the large value of the charge transfer energy @xmath2 compared to the @xmath3-@xmath4 hoppings , </S>",
    "<S> we perform a canonical transformation which eliminates the coupling with ligands to first order . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain an effective single - ion hamiltonian , where the influence of the ligands is reduced to the one - particle crystal field acting on @xmath4-like - functions . </S>",
    "<S> this derivation allows to elucidate the microscopic origin of various crystal field parameters and covalency reduction factors which are usually used empirically for the interpretation of optical and electron spin resonance experiments . </S>",
    "<S> the connection of these parameters with the geometry of the local environment becomes transparent . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally known @xmath5-values and the zero - field splitting @xmath6 are very well reproduced by the exact diagonalization of the effective single - ion hamiltonian with only one adjustable parameter @xmath7 . alternatively to the numerical diagonalization we use perturbation theory in the weak field scheme ( coulomb interaction @xmath8 cubic splitting @xmath8 trigonal splitting and spin - orbit coupling ) to derive compact analytical expressions for the spin - hamiltonian parameters that reproduce the result of exact diagonalization within 20% of accuracy . </S>"
