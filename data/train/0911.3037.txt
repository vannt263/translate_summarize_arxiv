    "the seesaw mechanism @xcite explains the lightness of left - handed ( lh ) neutrinos in a simple and elegant way .",
    "however , the seesaw models usually contain many more parameters than low energy observables . in order to economically describe the neutrino oscillations ,",
    "new ingredients are needed : the introduction of a horizontal symmetry could improve the situation and indeed many examples of this kind are present in literature .",
    "a common feature of these models is to provide a description of neutrino masses and mixings only at a very high energy scale . on the other hand , for a comparison of experimental results with the high energy predictions from flavour symmetries ,",
    "it is important to evolve the observables to low energies through renormalization group ( rg ) running . in general the deviations from high energy values due to the rg running consist in minor corrections , but the future improvements of neutrino experiments could hopefully bring the precision down to these small quantities .    in the mssm context , the rg effect on the light neutrino mass operator @xmath1 in the leading log approximation can approximately be parametrized as m_=i_u j^t_e j_^tm _",
    "j_j_e where @xmath2 is a universal contribution , @xmath3 , that is proportional to @xmath4 with @xmath5 the charged yukawa coupling , is always flavour dependent and , @xmath6 may depend on flavour or not .",
    "the running contributions to @xmath1 from @xmath3 are similar to those below the lightest right - handed ( rh ) neutrino mass and it is as known well under control . in fact",
    "large rg effects can be expected only in the case of a degenerate light neutrino spectrum or for large values of @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the running contribution from @xmath6 , however , is generally more complicated depending non - trivially on the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the last contribution can even be the dominant one since @xmath8 is expected to be of order one @xcite .",
    "similar conclusions can be driven in the sm context , when assuming a flavour origin of the neutrino mass term @xmath1 . in seesaw models implemented by flavour symmetries",
    ", @xmath8 is usually subject to constraints in order to efficiently describe the observed neutrino mixing structure .",
    "we should expect that these constraints have also some important impacts on running effects . in this paper",
    ", we will show that , under quite general assumptions , flavour symmetries imply a @xmath6 contribution which has not effects on mixing angles . as a consequence even including energy ranges above and between the rh neutrino scales , the contribution from the charged lepton yukawa coupling @xmath3 on mixing patterns dominates .    in the first part of the paper , we will describe , in a very general context , two kinds of interesting constraints on @xmath8 from flavour symmetries and then analyze their impact on running effects .",
    "we first consider flavour models in which @xmath8 is proportional to a unitary matrix .",
    "it is the case , for example , when the rh singlet neutrinos or the charged leptons are in a irreducible representation of the flavour group @xmath9",
    ".    then we extend this constraint to a more general class of flavour models in which the mixing textures are independent from the mass eigenstates . as a general result",
    ", we find that in this class of models , the effect of @xmath6 can always be absorbed by a small shift on neutrino mass eigenvalues and the mixing angles remain unchanged .",
    "this conclusion is , in particular , independent both from the specific mixing pattern implied by the flavour symmetry and the basis where we are working .",
    "mass - independent mixing textures usually exhibit a underlying discrete symmetry nature .",
    "for example , the tribimaximal ( tb ) mixing pattern @xcite which is defined by u_tb= (    ccc & 1/ & 0 + -1/ & 1/ & -1/ + -1/ & 1/ & + 1/    )  , [ utb ] belongs to this class of mixing textures . tb mixing pattern ,",
    "widely studied in the last years , provides a very simple first order description of the existing oscillation data @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been realized that the tb mixing matrix of eq .",
    "( [ utb ] ) can naturally arise as the result of a particular vacuum alignment of scalars that break spontaneously certain discrete flavour symmetries .",
    "a class of economical flavour models which can naturally explains tb mixing is based on @xmath0 discrete symmetry @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "subsequently the symmetry group @xmath0 has also been extended to the group @xmath10 @xcite and @xmath11 @xcite to cover a reasonable description also for quarks .",
    "another important historical example of mass - independent mixing scheme is the bimaximal ( bm ) mixing ( see @xcite for a recent revival of bm in the context of the discrete symmetry @xmath11 and for an up - to - date list of references ) .",
    "the running effects on bm @xcite and tb @xcite mixing patterns have already been studied in literature without , however , consider an explicit realization based on flavour symmetry .",
    "then , as an explicit example , in the second part of the paper , we describe in detail the rg effects on the tb mixing texture in the lepton flavour model proposed by altarelli - feruglio ( af ) @xcite . at leading order ,",
    "this model contains less parameters than the case of a general tb pattern considered in @xcite .",
    "then our result may not a priori reproduce the same results obtain in @xcite . in our analysis , the rg corrections to mixing angles and the phases are discussed as functions of the lightest neutrino mass and the type of spectrum .",
    "the analysis has been performed both in the standard model ( sm ) framework and the its minimal susy extension ( mssm ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we analytically discuss the rg effects on the neutrino mass operator @xmath1 in a type i seesaw model . in section 3 , we characterize two general classes of flavour models in which @xmath6 has no effects on mixing angles .",
    "then we turn to rg effects from @xmath3 on tb mixing pattern . in section 4",
    "we introduce the af model and show its main features including also the next - to - leading ( nlo ) contributions coming from higher dimensional operators . in section 5 , a more detailed numerical analysis on the impact of rg running in the af model is given .",
    "the result has been compared also with the nlo contributions . in the end in section 6",
    "we conclude summarizing our main results .",
    "in this section we begin to analyze , in a general context , the rg equations for neutrino masses below and above the seesaw threshold , both in the sm and in mssm extended with three right - handed neutrinos .",
    "for definiteness , we consider the following lagrangian = e^ct y_e h^+ ^ct y_h^+ ^ct m_r ^c + h.c .",
    "where @xmath13 are the lh lepton doublets , @xmath14 the rh charged lepton singlets and @xmath15 is the higgs doublet . in the supersymmetric case , this lagrangian should be identified to a superpotential where @xmath16 is replaced by @xmath17 and all the fields are instead supermultiplets . in what follows we concentrate only on the sm particles , postponing the study of their supersymmetric partners elsewhere : for this reason in our notation a chiral superfield and its @xmath18-parity even component are denoted by the same letter .    given the heavy majorana and the dirac neutrino mass matrices , @xmath19 and respectively , the light neutrino one is obtained from block - diagonalising the complete @xmath20 neutrino mass matrix : m_=-y_^tm_r^-1y _ , [ eqseesaw ] where @xmath21 refers to the vev of the higgs field , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 gev ) . the equivalent relation in the supersymmetric case",

    "this fact suggests a dominant contribution coming from the charged lepton sector . for the atmospheric and reactor angles ,",

    "since the experimental value of the solar angle is better measured than the other two , the running effects become more important in this case . indeed , rg correction to the tb solar angle evades the @xmath272 limit as it can be clearly seen in figure [ fig : ang ] .",
    "anyway , we observe that for both the atmospheric and solar angles , the running contribution is of the same order as the contribution from nlo operators .",
    "now we move to analyze the case of ih . in this case , since the neutrino spectrum predicted by the af model is almost degenerate , the contribution from the charged lepton sector in eqs .",
    "( [ eqdeltayedagyeih ] ) is subdominant . as a consequence",
    "the information which distinguishes the sm case from the mssm one is mainly dictated by @xmath92 defined in eq .",
    "( [ deltatau ] ) . as a result",
    "the running effects in the mssm are always larger than in the sm and for large @xmath7 they are potentially dangerous .",
    "the curves corresponding to the atmospheric and reactor angles do not go above the @xmath255 and @xmath272 windows respectively .",
    "however , the deviation from @xmath276 presents a more interesting situation .",
    "for example , for @xmath277 , the rg effects push the value of the solar angle beyond the @xmath255 limit for entire spectrum . for lower values of @xmath93 ,",
    "the model is within the @xmath255 limit only for a part of the spectrum where the neutrinos are less degenerate .",
    "confronting with the running effects , in the ih case , the contribution from nlo operators in the af model is under control .",
    "majorana phases are affected by rg running effects too .",
    "since there is not experimental information on majorana phases available in this moment we will simply show their values at low energy , eventually comparing them with the prediction in the af model .",
    "we stress again that they are completely determined by only one parameter , the mass of the lightest neutrino , @xmath238 for nh and @xmath239 for ih .     and @xmath278 as functions of the lightest lh neutrino masses . for the nh ( left panel ) the corresponding curves at low and high energies are undistinguishable . for the ih ( right panel ) the curves refers to low energy values in mssm with @xmath267 ( solid blue or red ) and the af prediction at @xmath121 ( dashed blue or red).,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ] and @xmath278 as functions of the lightest lh neutrino masses . for the nh ( left panel ) the corresponding curves at low and high energies are undistinguishable . for the ih ( right panel ) the curves refers to low energy values in mssm with @xmath267 ( solid blue or red ) and the af prediction at @xmath121 ( dashed blue or red).,title=\"fig:\",width=294 ]    in the case of nh ,",
    "majorana phases are essentially not corrected by rg effects .",

    "( [ deltaalpha13 ] , [ deltaalpha23 ] ) are proportional to @xmath281 which is close to zero , as we can see looking at the left panel of figure [ fig : maj ] . in the case of ih ,",
    "mssm rg effects always increase the values of phases when moving from high energy to low energy and they are maximized for @xmath260 , especially when the neutrino spectrum becomes degenerate . on the contrary , in the sm context",

    "although the final dirac phase can be large , jarlskog invariant , which measures an observable cp violation , remains small because of the smallness of @xmath283 .",
    "we remember that these results are valid both for the sm and for mssm .",
    "the flavour sector is poorly known within the sm or the mssm and the masses and mixings are considered as free parameters that can be adjusted to agree with experiments .",
    "this lack can be improved by adding to the sm or the mssm gauge group appropriate flavour symmetries such that yukawa couplings can be understood in a more fundamental way . even though the mechanism that generates the fermion masses is not yet completely understood ,",
    "a great effort has been made in the last years , especially after the discovery of neutrino masses which are significantly smaller than those of charged fermions .",
    "furthermore , the leptonic mixing pattern is also very different from @xmath284 because it contains a nearly maximal atmospheric angle @xmath285 and a solar angle very approximate to the tb prediction .",
    "the flavour structure of the neutrino mass matrix can be nicely explained by ( type i ) seesaw mechanism implemented with flavour symmetries . in order to naturally describe lepton masses and mixings ,",
    "however , the flavour group must be ( spontaneously ) broken .",
    "then we can expect that the lo prediction of a flavour symmetry is always subject by subleading corrections characterized by small symmetry breaking parameters ( @xmath204 and @xmath203 in our case ) .",
    "then , in a consistent flavour model building , these subleading corrections must be safely under control .    in any flavour model",
    ", there is also an other independent correction to the lo predictions which is due to the rg evolution of parameters . in this paper",
    "we have studied these running effects on neutrino mixing patterns . in seesaw models ,",
    "the running contribution from the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath8  , encoded in @xmath6  , is generally dominant at energy above the seesaw threshold .",
    "however , this effect , which in general introduces appreciable deviations from the lo mixing patterns , does not affect the mixing angles , under specific conditions : in the first part of the paper , we have analyzed two classes of models in which this indeed happens .",
    "the first class is characterized by a unitary @xmath8  .",
    "it is the case , for example , when the rh singlet neutrinos or the charged leptons being in a irreducible representation of the flavour group .",
    "the second class is the so called mass - independent mixing pattern , in which , in particular , the effect of @xmath6 can be absorbed by a small shift on neutrino mass eigenvalues leaving mixing angles unchanged .",
    "the widely studied tb mixing pattern belongs , for example , to this second class of models .    in the second part of the paper",
    ", we focused on a special realization of the general class of flavour models studied in the first part .",
    "we were interested in the af model for tb mixing where the flavour symmetry group is given by @xmath286 .",
    "the aim is to analyze the rg effects on the tb mixing pattern in addition to the nlo corrections already present in this model and to confront them with experimental values .",
    "the analysis has been performed both in the sm and mssm and for both neutrino spectra .",
    "we found that for nh light neutrinos , the dominant running contribution comes from the charged lepton sector which weakly depends on both @xmath93 and mass degeneracy . as a result , for this type of spectrum , the tribimaximal prediction is stable under rg evolution .",
    "moreover , the running contribution is of the same order or smaller with respect to the contribution from nlo operators . on the other hand , in the case of ih",
    ", the deviation of the solar angle from its tb value can be larger than the nlo contribution and , in particular , for @xmath277 an ih spectrum is strongly disfavored . in the end , observe that for both spectra , the reactor angle @xmath283 does not receive appreciable deviations from zero ( at a level @xmath287 u ) .    the effects of rg running can be manifested also in other phenomena which are not directly related to the neutrino properties , such as lepton flavour violating ( lfv ) transitions , leptogenesis , etc .",
    "for example , in @xcite , it has been pointed out that , in the limit of an exact @xmath0 symmetry , all cp violating asymmetries vanish .",
    "then when the flavour symmetry is spontaneously broken , nlo corrections become important in generating the desired leptogenesis . on the other hand , also the rg evolution can introduce symmetry breaking effects which can be in principle dominant over nlo contributions . as a result ,",
    "the estimate of generated leptogenesis can be quite different from those obtained in @xcite since they do not take into account the rg effects .",
    "another important consequence of rg running is the generation of off diagonal terms in the soft susy breaking mass matrices , contributing to lfv rare processes . in a series of papers @xcite",
    "it has been studied the impact of using flavour symmetries in order to explain the measured bounds on rare decays .",
    "in @xcite it has already been shown that , below the seesaw scales , the running effect is negligible with respect to that originated in the corresponding flavour theory .",
    "however between the seesaw scales the threshold effects are important and the two contributions to lfvs can be comparable .",
    "all these issues are very interesting and are subject for a further investigation .",

    "schmidt for useful comments on the previous version of the paper .",

    "in order to calculate the rg evolution of the light neutrino mass matrix , the rges for all the parameters of the theory have to be solved simultaneously .",
    "we use the notation defined in the text , where a superscript @xmath136 denotes a quantity between the @xmath288th and the @xmath289th mass threshold . when all the rh neutrinos are integrated out , the rges can be recovered by setting the neutrino yukawa coupling @xmath8 to zero , while in the full theory above the highest seesaw scale , the superscript @xmath136 has to be omitted .    in the sm extended by singlet neutrinos ,",

    "<S> we study renormalization group running effects on neutrino mixing patterns when a ( type i ) seesaw model is implemented by suitable flavour symmetries . </S>",
    "<S> we are particularly interested in mass - independent mixing patterns to which the widely studied tribimaximal mixing pattern belongs . in this class of flavour models , </S>",
    "<S> the running contribution from neutrino yukawa coupling , which is generally dominant at energies above the seesaw threshold , can be absorbed by a small shift on neutrino mass eigenvalues leaving mixing angles unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , in the whole running energy range , the change in mixing angles is due to the contribution coming from charged lepton sector . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , we analyze in detail these effects in an explicit flavour model for tribimaximal neutrino mixing based on an @xmath0 discrete symmetry group . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for normally ordered light neutrinos , the tribimaximal prediction is essentially stable under renormalization group evolution . on the other hand , in the case of inverted hierarchy , the deviation of the solar angle from its tb value can be large depending on mass degeneracy .     </S>",
