    "electron transport through molecular wires has been under intense theoretical ( see e.g. @xcite ) and experimental ( see e.g. @xcite ) study in the last few years .",
    "theoretical studies usually fall into two categories .",
    "the first focuses on the _ ab - initio _ computations of the orbitals relevant for the motion of excess charges through the molecular wire @xcite , while the other @xcite employs generic models to gain qualitative understanding of the transport process . at the simplest level @xcite the wire hamiltonian",
    "is described by a tight - binding chain composed of @xmath1 sites with nearest - neighbor coupling ( huckel model ) that represents the electron transfer ( tunneling ) interactions between adjacent sites .",
    "this model has been generalized to include coulomb interactions between electrons on the same site @xcite ( hubbard model ) and/or electron - phonon interactions @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we investigate another extension of this model , in which we take into account energy transfer interactions between adjacent molecular sites .",
    "energy - transfer interactions - excitation ( deexcitation ) of a site accompanied by deexcitation ( excitation ) of another are well - known in the exciton theory @xcite .",
    "in particular , frenkel excitons - neutral excited states in which an electron and a hole are placed on the same site are readily transferred between sites , and such intersite interactions can accompany the charge transfer processes as was shown for charge - transfer excitons @xcite in ( quasi- ) one - dimensional structures @xcite , including polysilanes thorne90,trommsdorff92,shimizu00 .",
    "the latter show a weak coupling between the frenkel exciton with the admixture of charge transfer states and nuclear motions @xcite",
    ".    in molecular bridges energy - transfer interactions can also sometimes have important effects on charge transfer dynamics .",
    "charge and energy transfer in a linear 2,2:6,2-terpyridine - based trinuclear ru-(ii)-os(ii ) nanometer - sized array @xcite , and one - dimensional energy / electron transfer of amylose - encapsulated chain chromophores @xcite are examples . in addition , it seems likely that energy transfer takes place in chemically responsive molecular transistors based on a dimer of terpyridyl molecules combined with ion co@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that electron transfer is a tunneling process that depends exponentially on the site - site distance , while energy transfer is associated with dipolar coupling that scales like the inverse cube of this distance , and can therefore dominate at larger distances .",
    "the importance of the latter stems also from geometric issues , which are related to the dipole - dipole interaction between different sites occurring in the vicinity of metal particles in molecular nanojunctions .",
    "really , gersten and nitzan @xcite predicted accelerated dipole - dipole energy transfer near a solid particle ( see also polman07,polman09 ) , and in the last time a number of works devoted to the exciton - plasmon interactions have been published wiederrecht04,wurtz07,cade09,bondarev09 that are related to physical effects due to the local field enhancement schatz03jpcb , stockman03,markel05,wang_shen06,brixner06,sukharev_seideman07 .    how will such dipolar interactions affect the conduction properties of molecular junctions ?",
    "this question was addressed by galperin , nitzan and ratner by the example of a junction composed of one - site - wire and two metal leads @xcite , where they predicted the existence of non - landauer current induced by the electron - hole excitations in the leads . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there were no analog treatment of simultaneous electron and energy transfer ( excitons ) in multisite bridges .",
    "here we address this problem by using the liouville - von neumann equation ( lne ) for the total density operator to derive an expression for the conduction of a molecular wire model that contains both electron and energy - transfer interactions . while not a central issue of the present work , we note that energy transfer is closely related to heat transfer through the molecular nanojunction - an issue of important consequences for junction stability and integrity .",
    "treated separately , the simplest models of exciton and electron transport may be represented by tight - binding transport models , albeit in different representations . indeed , in the wire hamiltonian ( see eq.([eq : h_wire ] ) below ) , both the electron- and energy - transfer terms are binary in terms of the annihilation and creation operators for electrons and excitons , respectively .",
    "their simultaneous treatment , however , constitutes a rather complex non - linear problem . in this work",
    "we combine a tight - binding model for electron transport @xcite with that of one - dimensional frenkel excitons @xcite to investigate the effect of energy transfer interaction on electron transport in one - dimensional nanowires .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec.[sec : model ] we introduce our model and in sec.[sec : master_equation ] we derive a master equation in the eigenbasis of many - electron wire hamiltonian .",
    "sec.sec:analytical is devoted to the analytical solution of the problem where we consider both non - interacting electrons at a site and strong coulomb repulsion at sites . in sec.[subsec : exciton_induced_current ] we show that the exciton type interactions can open new channels for electronic conduction . in sec.[sec : numerical simulations ] we carry out numerical simulations , compare them with the analytical theory and show the existence of the exciton  blocking  effect .",
    "we summarize our results in sec.[sec : conclusion ] . in appendix",
    "a we calculate the eigenbasis of many - electron wire hamiltonian for non - interacting electrons at a site , using the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite . in appendix b we present auxiliary calculations .",
    "we consider a spinless model for a molecular wire that comprises two interacting sites , each represented by its ground , @xmath3 , and excited , @xmath4 , states positioned between two leads represented by free electron reservoirs @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( fig.[fig : dimer_model ] ) .",

    "the molecular - leads interactions @xmath43 are taken to account for two physical processes : @xmath44 describes electron transfer between the molecular bridge and the leads that gives rise to net current in the biased junction , while @xmath45 describes energy transfer between the bridge and electron - hole excitations in the leads . in ( [ eq : v_m1 ] ) and ( eq : v_n_exciton2 ) @xmath46 is the lead closer the the molecular site @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 denotes hermitian conjugate . in",
    "what follows it will be useful also to define the population operators @xmath51 in the manifolds of ground ( @xmath52 ) and excited ( @xmath53 ) site levels .",
    "we consider electronic transport through the molecular wire where the leads @xmath54 are taken to be each in its own equilibrium characterized by its temperature @xmath55 ( here taken equal for the two leads ) and electronic electrochemical potential @xmath56 .",

    "consequently expectation values for lead operators can be traced back to the expression @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the excitonic operators are equal to @xmath35 .",
    "the effect of the corresponding interaction in the bridge ( @xmath60 ) on the charge transport properties is the subject of our discussion .",
    "our analysis is based on the lne , or the generalized master equation for the reduced density matrix of the molecular subsystem , obtained using a standard procedure @xcite based on taking @xmath61 as a perturbation .",
    "briefly , one starts with the lne for the total density operator and use the projectors of the type @xmath62 in order to derive an equation for the time evolution of the reduced density matrix @xmath63 .",

    "<S> the effect of excitonblocking is modified for a heterodimer bridge , and disappears for strong coulomb repulsion at sites . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> the exciton type interactions can open new channels for electronic conduction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , in the case of strong coulomb repulsion , conduction exists even when the electronic connectivity does not exist . </S>"
