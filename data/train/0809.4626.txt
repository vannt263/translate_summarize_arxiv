    "according to quantum mechanics , a molecule that contains two identical atoms whose nuclei have nonzero spins can exist in the form of spin isomers .",
    "in particular , a water molecule exists in one of the two spin isomers , ortho or para with parallel or antiparallel proton spins , respectively .",

    "measurement of the para to ortho ratio was used to estimate the formation temperature of molecules in space @xcite .",

    "recently andreev @xmath0 @xmath1 @xcite discussed an expected difference in the response of the ortho and para forms of water to a non - uniform dc electric field near solid surfaces , which may potentially lead to isomers separation .",
    "we are currently exploring an alternative route to ortho and para separation based on selective field - free alignment and antialignment of water isomers by short nonresonant laser pulses ( for a review on field - free alignment see @xcite ) . by alignment",
    "we mean the angular localization of a molecular axis along the laser polarization direction , while antialignment assumes localization of the same molecular axis in the plane perpendicular to the laser polarization .",
    "although previous experimental studies on dissociative fragmentation by relatively long laser pulses have not found alignment of water molecules @xcite , we show that a sizable alignment can be achieved in ultra - short regime .",

    "while the rotational energy of the para molecules is further increased , the energy of the ortho molecules is reduced as the result of the action of the second pulse .",

    "we showed that these two forms of the water molecules experience distinct series of transient alignment and anti - alignment events , which leads to the angular separation of an initially isotropic mixture of nuclear spin modifications .",
