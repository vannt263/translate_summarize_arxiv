    "all other quantities involved in this relation  characterize  the junction itself and can be easily measured . as an example , the value of @xmath19 mv presented in the fig.[fig1 ] being combined with the value of @xmath20  k@xmath21 gives @xmath22 @xmath23v / k in good agreement with the value expected for the indicated electron density and temperature . in fact , the derivation of eq.([seeb - main ] ) is based on the potentiality of the temperature- and coulomb fields and on the constancy of the coulomb potential along all metal contacts including ohmic ones @xcite .",
    "this allows to prove the eq.([seeb - main ] ) is independent of geometry of the current and heat flows in the samples as long as the junction resistance is much greater than the bulk resistance of the substrate .",

    "the qualitative analysis of the expression ( [ resp - base ] ) as a function of @xmath53 with account for the actual limitation of the integration region by the damping exponential- or oscillating bessel function ( or both ) in the integrand shows that at factual values of parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 of order @xmath61 @xmath23 m and @xmath62 of order of @xmath63 @xmath23 m the response must down as @xmath64 in the range of @xmath65 hz@xmath66 hz and transforms to @xmath67 law at higher frequencies .",

    "the observed behavior of the curve 1 - 3 in fig.[fig4 ] is evidently in contradiction with the reasoning presented above and exact computations of eq.([resp - base ] ) support this evidence .",

    ", the values of @xmath3 were needed to decrease in 10 times .",
    "the very sharp drop of the curve 4 in the high - frequency tail is the result of large displacement ( @xmath83 m ) between the centers of the focused laser beam ( @xmath84 m ) and the metal electrode .",
    "such a kind of measurements allows to determine @xmath3 directly disregarding uncertainties of other parameters involved as it will farther be explained .    by inspecting of fig.[fig4 ]",
    "one can see that exact calculations of eq.([resp - base ] ) with the indicated reference values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath51 enable to describe the measured frequency dependence for the junctions on the epitaxially - grown substrates only ( curves 4 and 5 ) . just in this case",
    "the heat transport passes mainly through the part of the semiconductor substrate that is free of electrons . in the other case , presented by curves 1 - 3 ,",
    "the used values of @xmath3 were reduced in 10 times to reach an agreement with experimental data under all measurement conditions .",
    "almost the same results can be obtained with the reference values of @xmath3 and reduced in 10 times @xmath51 .",
    "the meaning of this interchangeability will be discussed later .",
    "it follows that just the electronic constituent is responsible for the anomalous heat propagation in the semiconductor .    to check if the observed effect depends on the way of the electron heating , the pulsed current heating at the reverse- and the forward polarities",
    "was realized by specially designed switching electronic circuit .",
    "the circuit enabled to measure the thermoresponse signal of order of @xmath85 nv in @xmath86 @xmath23s after the voltage pulse of @xmath36 v magnitude was supplied , in spite of the large capacitance @xmath87 nf of the investigated junctions . the time - dependent pulsed response measured by the boxcar integrator",
    "was converted then in the frequency domain using digital fourier transformation .",
    "it turn out that frequency dependences obtained at the reverse and forward pulsed bias are different . at the forward bias",
    "the non - equilibrium electrons were generated inside the metal film and the emitted phonons only were primary mechanism for the heat transport into the semiconductor . in that case ,",
    "the calculated frequency dependence of the response manifested @xmath88 drop - down behavior up to several hundred khz corresponding to the near - surface heat generation and the normally expected lattice heat transport into the semiconductor . at the reverse bias electrons were injected across the schottky barrier from the metal electrode into the semiconductor with kinetic energy about @xmath36 ev above fermi level and produced highly non - equilibrium state of the electron gas due to intensive electron - electron collisions . that is the joule heat was directly scattered inside the electron gas of the semiconductor .",
    "the respective frequency dependence shows the main sign of the abnormal heat transport , e.g. , the fall off more sharp then @xmath41 beginning from several hundred hz .    in principle , the thermoresponse can fall off with the frequency more quickly then @xmath42 even under the normal heat transport conditions as it is seen from the experimental and calculated curves 4 in fig.[fig4 ]",
    "that case takes place for @xmath60 , i.e. , when there is a distance between the centers of the metal electrode and the focal spot .",
    "surely , this behavior is contained in the eq.([resp - base ] ) and can be explained on that ground . however , there is a simpler way to understanding that gives us also some practically useful means .",
    "the solution of the heat conductivity equation far away the excitation region has the asymptotic form like @xmath89 . taking into account the definition of @xmath90 given above it is easy to obtain the dependence of the response @xmath91 on the frequency @xmath53 at @xmath49 constant in the form@xmath92    accordingly to this expression there is the linear dependence of @xmath93 on @xmath94 . that dependence can be applied to the determination of @xmath3 without any reference to the junction ( heat detector ) characteristics and irradiation conditions excluding the distance @xmath49 .",
    "the application of the claimed method to the curve 4 results in the value of @xmath95 @xmath69/s in a good agreement with the adopted value @xmath96 @xmath69/s .",
    "the observed anomalous frequency dependence of the thermal response can be related either to a diminution of an effective thermal diffusivity in the system of electrons + lo - phonons + acoustic phonons or to a real increasing of the size of the region where the thermalization of the nonequilibrium electron - lo - phonon subsystem takes place owing to the interaction with the thermal bath of acoustic phonons .",
    "the investigated frequency band of the heating modulation is too low - frequency for one to expect diminution of the thermal diffusivity owing to the mechanism examined in @xcite .",
    "the change in @xmath97 may be attributed either change in @xmath98 or in @xmath99 or in both . since the heat conductivity @xmath98 appears in eq.([resp - base ] ) in front of the integral besides @xmath3 we can use the absolute magnitude of the response to distinguish the contributions of @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the observed change of thermodiffusivity @xmath3 .",
    "the realization of this procedure shown that the main role in the change of @xmath3 belong to the heat capacitance , if this change does exist .",
    "the joint set of heat conductivity equations for the electrons , lo - phonons , and acoustic phonons analyzed in @xcite allows supposing that the first case might be considered as the result from rising the contribution of the nonequilibrium electron - lo - phonon subsystem to the heat capacity of the semiconductor .",
    "the second case may be taken into consideration because the calculated curves consist also with the measured data 1 - 3 for the bulk - doped sample in fig.[fig4 ] at thermodiffusivity @xmath100 @xmath69/s and @xmath77 @xmath69/s ( reference values ) and reduced radiation absorption coefficient @xmath101 cm@xmath21 instead of @xmath102 cm@xmath21 .",
    "the value @xmath81 @xmath69/s has been confirmed by direct measurements of the thermoresponse as a function of the intercenter distance @xmath49 according to eq.([resp - far ] ) .",
    "the observed phenomenon can then be interpreted as a long - range tail effect in the spatial response of an inhomogeneous electron gas corresponding to the known long - time tail in the time response of spatially - homogeneous electron gas . as it is known , the latter is related with the nonequilibrium corrections to the pair correlation function of electrons . in @xcite",
    "the expression for the electron energy loss rate via electron - phonon interaction was derived with explicitly found contribution of the nonequilibrium pair correlations . however , the role of this correction in the heat transport is unclear yet .",
