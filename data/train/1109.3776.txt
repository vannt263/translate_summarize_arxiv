    "heavy - ion collisions provide a possibility to study the properties of nuclear matter in conditions that are vastly different than reported in normal nuclei @xcite .",
    "considerable progress has been made recently in determining the equation of state of nuclear matter from heavy ion reaction data @xcite .",
    "a prominent role among available observables is played by the collective flow .",
    "much theoretical and experimental efforts have been made to the study of collective flow in hics @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow has proven to be one of the most fruitful probes for extracting the eos and the dynamics of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the parameter of elliptic flow is quantified by the second - order fourier coefficient @xcite from the azimuthal distribution of detected particles at midrapidity as :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the azimuthal angle of emitted particle momentum relative to the x axis .",
    "positive values for @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 reflect a preferential in - plane emission , whereas negative values of @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 reflect a preferential out - of - plane emission .",
    "yu - ming zheng _ et al . , _ @xcite studied the proton elliptic flow in the collisions of @xmath7 at energies from 30 to 100 mev / nucleon .",
    "they showed that , with increasing incident energy , the elliptic flow shows a transition from positive to negative values .",
    "its magnitude was found to depend on both nuclear equation of state ( eos ) as well as on the nucleon - nucleon scattering cross - section . on the other hand , d. persram _ et al . , _ @xcite",
    "have shown , for the first time , the effect of parameter - free self - consistent calculation of nucleon - nucleon in - medium scattering cross - section implemented buu model on different flows .",

    "et al . , _ @xcite have investigated the elliptic flow in heavy - ion collisions at energies from several tens to several hundreds of mev / nucleon .",
    "they showed that , soft nuclear equation of state and incident energy dependent in - medium nucleon - nucleon cross - sections are required to describe the excitation function of the elliptic flow at intermediate energies .",
    "our study is performed within the framework of iqmd @xcite model where hadrons propagate with hamilton equations of motion : @xmath8 with @xmath9 the baryon - baryon potential @xmath10 , in the above relation , reads as : @xmath11\\nonumber\\\\ & & + ~t_{3}\\frac{exp(|\\vec{r}^\\prime-\\vec{r}|/\\mu)}{(|\\vec{r}^\\prime-\\vec{r}|/\\mu)}~+~\\frac{z_{i}z_{j}e^{2}}{|\\vec{r}^\\prime -\\vec{r}|}\\nonumber\\\\ & & + t_{6}\\frac{1}{\\varrho_0}t_3^{i}t_3^{j}\\delta(\\vec{r_i}^\\prime -\\vec{r_j } ) .",

    "in addition , pauli blocking ( of the final state ) of baryons is taken into account by checking the phase space densities in the final states .",
    "for the present analysis , simulations are carried out for two sets of the reaction using soft equation of state .",
    "for the first case , the mass of the colliding nuclei is fixed to be 124 units and for the second set , the mass of the colliding nuclei is fixed to be 40 units .",
    "in other words , we study , the reactions of @xmath0 , where @xmath22 = ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , respectively .",

    "the elliptical flow is defined as the average difference between the square of x and y components of the particles transverse momentum .",
    "mathematically , it can be written as :    @xmath35    where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the x and y components of the momentum .",
    "the positive value of elliptical flow describes the eccentricity of an ellipse - like distribution and indicates in - plane enhancement of the particle emission . on the other hand ,",

    "+ ( b ) peak of the gaussian shifts towards lower value of @xmath4 @xmath43 @xmath6 for the heavier fragments .",
    "this is because the free nucleons and lmf s feel the mean field directly , while heavy fragments have weaker sensitivity @xcite .",

    "we divided total elliptical flow into contributions from target - like ( tl ) ( left panels ) , mid - rapidity ( middle panels ) and projectile - like ( pl ) ( right panels ) particles at e = 100 mev / nucleon .",

    "these figures reveal following points : + ( a ) @xmath4 @xmath38 @xmath6 is sensitive to different nucleon - nucleon cross - sections .",
    "weaker squeeze - out flow is observed in the case of isospin independent cross - section .",
    "this happens because in the case of isospin dependent cross - section , neutron - proton cross - section is three times larger compared to neutron - neutron and proton - proton cross - section that will enhance binary collisions .",

    "we note : + ( a ) the elliptical flow turns negative with beam energy .",
    "this is because spectators move faster after @xmath4 @xmath38 @xmath6 reaches a minimum value @xcite .",
    "the energy at which this behavior changes is found to decrease with the size of the fragment .",
    "this means that the flow of heavier fragments is larger than that of lmf s and free nucleons at all beam energies .",
    "these findings are in agreement with ref .",
    "+ ( b ) there occurs a transition from in - plane emission to out - of - plane .",
