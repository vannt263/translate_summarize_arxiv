    "science contests for high - school students have a hundred - years - old tradition in hungary @xcite . the first one , open to students who just completed their high - school cursus , was organized in 1894 to mark the appointment of l. etvs as minister of education .",
    "this was also the year when the _ high - school journal for mathematics and physics _ was first published .",
    "this journal sets selected problems each month , and the best solutions are published under the name of the student who solved it .    the early prize - winners of the etvs contest include such outstanding future scientists as l. fejr ( who became famous in mathematical analysis ) , th .",
    "von krmn ( who made important contributions to hydro and aerodynamics ) , a. haar ( remembered for his invariant measure on group manifolds )  followed by many others .    in 1916 , in the middle of world war",
    "i , a physics contest was held for the first time  and l. szilrd ( who later , with e. fermi , patented the nuclear reactor ) came second .",
    "e. wigner ( who got the nobel prize for using group theory in atomic physics ) , and j. von neumann ( who built the first computer and contributed to many fields , ranging from game theory to quantum mechanics ) only missed the contest because of the turmoil following the disaster of world war  i.    in 1925 edward teller not only got the first prize in physics , but also shared the mathematics prize with laszlo tisza .",
    "they became friends and their friendship lasted until teller s recent death .",
    "soon tisza ( then a mathematics student in gttingen ) changed to physics under the influence of born , and published his very first paper jointly with teller ( who was preparing his ph .",
    "d. in leipzig with heisenberg ) on molecular spectrum .",
    "later tisza introduced the two - fluid model of superfluidity , further developped by landau . at 96",
    ", he is still active at mit .    in the late twenties ,",
    "von neumann and szilrd even suggested that the university examinations could be replaced by such a contest @xcite .",
    "the tradition still continues , and contributes to forming future generations of scientists @xcite .",
    "the contests have been internationalized with the _ international olympiads for high - school students _ : first in mathematics , and , since 1967 , also in physics .",
    "the etvs contest lasts 5 hours , and the use of _ all _ documents or tools is allowed .",
    "three problems that require imagination and creative thinking rather than lexical knowledge are asked .",
    "they can , in some cases , lead to genuine research .",
    "a famous example is that of a. csszr ( a distinguished topologist ) , who , as a young assistent , was called to survey the contest .",
    "while the high - school students were working , csszr figured out a generalization of the geometric problem given that year , and later published a paper on his findings .",
    "some of the physics problems deserve further thinking also . in 1969  the year of the moon landing ,  for example , an exercise asked the following . _",
    "a spacecraft moves on a circular trajectory of radius @xmath0 km around a planet of radius @xmath1 km .",
    "then , for a short time , the rocket engins ( directed oppositely to its motion ) , are switched on .",
    "this puts the spacecraft onto an elliptic trajectory , which touches the planet s surface at the opposite point of the trajectory .",
    "which proportion of its kinetic energy went lost  ? _    the problem can be solved using elementary methods alone .",
    "it is , however , instructive to describe it also using different , more sophisticated , methods , which provide us with an insight into the problem of planetary motion .    from a physical point of view , we have the following situation .",
    "as the engine works for a very short time , the position of the spacecraft does not change considerably . owing to its loss of velocity",
    ", the gravitational attraction wins the race and pulls the circular trajectory more tight  : the trajectory becomes an ellipse with major axis @xmath2 .",
    "our task amounts to comparing the kinetic energies of the two types of motions in the same ( aphelium ) point .",
    "= 6.3truecm    -0.2truecm    the clue is to establish the following statement : _ the ratio of the [ aphelium ] kinetic energies of the two types of motion is the perihelium - distance divided by the major semi - axis of the elliptical motion _ , @xmath3 then the answer to the originally asked question follows at once : @xmath4 now , as @xmath5 is the excentricity , ( [ 1/19 ] ) is indeed @xmath6  : _ the relative loss of energy is the numerical excentricity of the new orbit _ , i. e. , the measure of the  flattening \" of the circle .",
    "let us observe that the answer only depends on the geometric dimensions . with the given numerical data , we find @xmath7 .",
    "below we present several proofs of ( [ arany ] ) , ordered following their ever - increasing difficulty and required background knowledge .",
    "the first proof is elementary . according to the laws of circular motion , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is newton s constant .",
    "the [ square of the ] period is hence @xmath10    this circular motion has kinetic energy @xmath11 application of kepler s third law to the elliptic motion yields the period of this latter , @xmath12    the area of the ellipse is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the minor semi - axis .",
    "@xmath15 , the area is hence @xmath16 . the areal velocity , which is constant by kepler s second law , is therefore @xmath17 at the aphelium @xmath18 , so that after slowing down , the velocity is @xmath19 the corresponding kinetic energy is then @xmath20 which implies ( [ arany ] ) .    . denoting the aphelium and the perihelium velocities by @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the conservation of the energy and of the angular momentum ( divided by @xmath23 ) requires that @xmath24      \\frac{v_{a}\\cdot r}{2}=\\frac{v_{p}\\cdot r}{2}.      \\label{ellimp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    eliminating the perihelium velocity yields once again the kinetic energy ( [ aphenerg ] ) .",
    ".[iii ]    an important property of planetary motion @xcite is that the total energy only depends on the major axis , according to @xmath25 then it follows from the energy conservation that , in any point of the trajectory , the velocity satisfies @xmath26    for the circular motion , @xmath27 , and for the elliptic @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "plugging this into ( [ lemma ] ) , yields ( [ korenerg ] ) and ( [ aphenerg ] ) , respectively .    even more simply , observing that the change of the total energy is in fact that of the kinetic energy since the potential energy is unchanged , using ( [ totenerg ] ) we have @xmath29 writing here by ( [ korenerg ] ) @xmath30 in place of @xmath31 yields ( [ 1/19 ] ) directly .",
    "it is worth noting that , at a point @xmath32 of the trajectory , the ratio of the kinetic and the potential energies is , by ( [ lemma ] ) , @xmath33 we have therefore @xmath34 which yields again ( [ arany ] ) .",
    "furthermore , while the total energy only depends on the major semi - axis , this is not so for the parts taken individually by the kinetic and the potential energies .",
    "according to ( [ kinpot ] ) we have indeed @xmath35    the result can also be obtained from studying radial motion . for an arbitrary central potential @xmath36",
    ", the problem can be reduced to one - dimensional motion with effective potential @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the total angular momentum , cf .",
    "@xcite p. 75 .",
    "the radial velocity is therefore given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total energy .",
    "in the extremal points @xmath41 and @xmath42 the radial velocity vanishes , so that , for @xmath43 , @xmath44 thus @xmath45 but the aphelium velocity is @xmath46 so that @xmath47 for a circular motion at @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and therefore @xmath50 consistently with our previous result .    .",
    "kepler s third law is related to the behaviour of the system with respect to scaling @xcite  : if some trajectory is dilated from the focus by @xmath51 , and the time is dilated by @xmath52 , @xmath53 yields again a possible trajectory . in those points which correspond to each other ,",
    "both the kinetic and the potential energies [ and hence also the total energy ] are related as the inverse ratio of the geometric dimensions , @xmath54    let us now retract our original circular motion so that its radius equals to the major semi - axis of our elliptic motion above , i.e. , consider the dilation by @xmath55 . by ( [ kiii ] )",
    "the total energy [ and consistently with ( [ totenerg ] ) ] is @xmath56 this is , however , the same as the total energy of the elliptic motion , @xmath57 , since the major semi - axes are equal .",
    "hence once again @xmath58 then the result follows from ( [ kintoten ] ) .",
    "let us stress that kepler s third law did not suffice alone ; we also needed the statement about the total energy .    .",
    "it is worth describing the motion using the moving local frame introduced by frnet @xcite .",
    "then , for a trajectory of arbitrary shape , the normal component of the acceleration is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the radius of curvature i. e. , the radius of the osculating circle @xcite . in an extremal point of the ellipse",
    "the accelaration is normal , and points toward the focus .",
    "hence @xmath61 which generalizes the formula ( [ korero ] ) of circular motion . for the circle @xmath62",
    ", so that @xmath63 since the force is the same for both problems .",
    "we have hence proved : _ the ratio of the kinetic energies is identical to that of the radii of curvature_. in the extremal points of the ellipse , @xmath64 which implies again ( [ arany ] ) .",
    "this confirms our intuition : decreasing the velocity increases the curvature .",
    "using the explicit form , @xmath65 , of the force , ( [ altalanos ] ) would allow us to calculate the velocity as @xmath66 this is , however , not necessary for us : it was enough to know the geometric dimensions of the trajectory .    .",
    "a proof analogouos to that in ii is obtained if we use the so called `` runge - lenz '' vector @xcite @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the conserved angular momentum ; @xmath69 denotes the unit vector carried by the radius vector drawn form the earth s center to the spacecraft s position .",
    "= 7.5truecm    -0.4truecm    differentiating @xmath70-t with respect to time shows , using @xmath71 and the equation of motion , that @xmath70 is a constant of the motion .",
    "the scalar product of @xmath70 with @xmath72 vanishes , so that @xmath70 lies in the plane of the motion ; it points from the focus to the perihelium point  : @xmath73 . multiplying ( [ rungelenz ] ) with @xmath74 yields",
    "the trajectory @xcite as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the angle between @xmath70 and @xmath74 .",
    "( [ ellegy ] ) defines a conic with parameter @xmath77 and numerical excentricity @xmath78 .    returning to our initial problem ,",
    "let us observe that in the extremal points @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the unit vector directed from the center to the perihelium .",

    "@xmath86 hence @xmath87 which , together with ( [ extrrl ] ) yields @xmath88 writing @xmath89 for @xmath90 provides us again with ( [ arany ] ) or ( [ 1/19 ] ) .    drawing the instantaneous velocity vector from a fixed point @xmath91 of `` velocity space",
    "'' yields the _",
    "hodograph_. for planetary motion this is a circle @xcite . the simplest proof of this statement is obtained if we multiply the angular momentum vectorially with the runge - lenz vector @xcite . developping the double vector product and using @xmath92 yields @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the unit vector obtained by rotating @xmath69 around the direction of @xmath72 by @xmath95 degrees in the counter - clockwise direction . as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the unit vector directed along the @xmath98 axis of the coordinate plane .",
    "writing here @xmath87 the velocity vector is expressed as @xmath99    as the unit vector @xmath69 turns around during the motion , so does also @xmath94 ( advanced with ( @xmath95 degrees ) .",
    "the first term in ( [ hodo ] ) describes hence a circle of radius @xmath100 , whose center has been translated to @xmath101 , situated on the @xmath98 axis at distance @xmath102 below @xmath91 . for a circular trajectory @xmath103 and",
    "the hodograph becomes a circle around the origin with radius @xmath104 .",
    "= 6.5truecm    -0.6truecm    the velocity is the largest at the bottom of the circle , which corresponds to the perihelium point .",
    "the smallest velocity is obtained in turn in the aphelium , which is the top of the circle .",
    "then @xmath94 points vertically upwards , @xmath105 .",
    "then the length of this smallest velocity is plainly @xmath106 which yields ( [ excenten ] ) .",
    "alternatively , we can write @xmath107 in ( [ hodo ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that our problem here can be readily generalized .",
    "j. c. maxwell has in fact shown in a lovely little booklet @xcite that , in an _ arbitrary _ point @xmath32 of the trajectory , the velocity is @xmath108    maxwell proof only uses kepler s second law and some geometric properties of the ellipses .",
    "let in fact the sun be in one of the foci , @xmath109 , let @xmath110 be the other focus and draw perpendiculars @xmath111 and @xmath112 from the foci to the tangent to the ellipse at a point @xmath113 , see fig .",
    "= 9.5truecm    -0.6truecm    by kepler s second law , the areal velocity is constant and given by twice the area of the ellipse , @xmath114 , divided by the revolution time , @xmath115 , @xmath116    on the other hand , a known geometric property of the ellipse says that the half minor axis , @xmath14 , is the mean of @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119    finally , the `` optical property '' [ known to kepler ] says that all light rays emitted from one focus are reflected by ellipse to the other focus .",
    "it follows that the angles @xmath120 and @xmath121 are equal ; the triangles @xmath121 and @xmath122 are therefore similar .",
    "hence @xmath123 multiplication of the two relations yields @xmath124 since @xmath125 , the major axis of an ellipse .",
    "inserting @xmath126 into the square of ( [ velocity ] ) yields maxwell s formula ( [ altseb ] ) .    for a circular orbit in particular , @xmath127 .",
    "( in general , i. e. with the exception of the extremal points , the velocities @xmath128 and @xmath129 have different directions . ) hence @xmath130 using here kepler s iii law , we end up with the following simple expression : @xmath131 in words : _ at any point of the orbit , the square of the velocity to that of the circular motion through the same point is as the distance from the other focus to the semi major axis _  !",
    "for @xmath48 we recover in particular our previous result ( [ arany ] ) .",
    "last but not least , let us point out that the problem discussed here has actually been solved by newton over 300 years ago  ! proposition 16 .",
    "theorem 8 .",
    "corollary 3 . of his `` principia '' @xcite",
    "says in fact that `` _ the velocity in a conic , at the greatest or least distance from the focus , is to the velocity with which the body would move in a circle , at the same distance from the center , as the square root of the principal latus rectum is to the square root of twice that distance .",
    "_ '' translated into our notations , @xmath132 but the half the `` principal latus rectum '' is the harmonic mean of the periapsis and the apoapsis of the ellipse @xcite ( and also the parameter @xmath133 ) , @xmath134 inserting into ( [ newton ] ) the result ( [ arany ] ) is recovered once again .",
    "newton s original proof comes by a series of elementary geometric demonstrations using hardly more then the properties of similar triangles @xcite . the reader is referred to newton s principia for details .",
    "let us remark , though , that ( [ altarany ] ) provides a quick proof to newton s statement ( [ newton ] ) , since the prodcuct of @xmath135 and @xmath136 is @xmath137 .",
    "let us summarize our various approaches .",
    "our first proof only used kepler s laws specific for the planetary motion , and suits perfectly to a high - school student .",
    "the second and seventh proof is based on conservation laws ; the second uses that of the energy and the angular momentum , and the last the runge - lenz vector .",
    "this is early 19th century physics : the vector ( [ rungelenz ] ) was in fact introduced by laplace in 1799 , in his _ trait de mcanique cleste _ @xcite .",
    "ii , using high - school knowledge only , would clearly work for any conservative force , while vii is related to the `` hidden '' symmetry of of the kepler problem .",
    "although some of the results could be obtained by freshmen , this approach is not in general taught at the university .",
    "it leads to a group theoretical treatment of planetary motion @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath138 and ( [ casimir ] ) are the classical counterparts of the casimir relations of the so@xmath139 dynamical symmetry used by pauli to determine the spectrum of the hydrogen atom @xcite .",
    "proof v uses the general framework of co - moving coordinates called the frnet formul @xcite ( late 19th century ) , which makes part of regular university courses on mechanics and/or differential geometry .",
    "it can be applied to any central force problem : the reader is invited to work out what happens , e , g. , for a harmonic force @xmath140 ( when the trajectories are again ellipses . )",
    "the problem is readily generalized following maxwell @xcite ( proof ix ) , along the lines of proof i and adding some knowledge of geometry .",
    "remarkably , this general answer might have been found by kepler in the early 17th century  !",
    "interestingly , the very first question of the very first etvs physics contest ( that of szilard in 1916 ) , was on planetary motion : _ let us consider a miniaturized model of the solar system , where all distances are scaled as @xmath141 .",
    "how long would last a year  ? _",
    "the answer is that it would remain a year , since , assuming that all densities remain constant , the sun s mass would also decrease as the cube of its dimension .",
    "but this is precisely the condition , as seen from the scaling argument in proof v @xcite .",
