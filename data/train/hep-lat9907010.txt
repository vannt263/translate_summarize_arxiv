    "lattice@xcite formulation is a gauge invariant regulator of non abelian gauge theories .",
    "numerical simulations on the lattice produce from first principles regulated correlators of physical quantities .",
    "simulations can be used to compute quantities involving low energy modes , which are out of reach of perturbation theory , such as weak interaction matrix elements , masses , matrix elements of operators in the light cone expansion .",
    "the typical problems encountered in this `` phenomenological '' use of lattice are the removal of the cut off ( renormalization ) , and limitations in computer power .",
    "simulations can also be used to test theoretical ideas and to investigate the structure of the theory .",
    "an example of investigation of `` theoretical '' type is the study of the mechanism of confinement .",
    "the typical difficulty in this approach is to have good theoretical ideas to test numerically , and possibly to falsify from the first principles .",
    "apart from confinement itself there are a few fundamental issues at the background of our understanding of qcd . among them",
    "* the @xmath1 limit .",
    "the conjecture@xcite is that the basic properties of a gauge theory , e.g. confinement , are already contained in the limit in which the number of colours @xmath2 goes large , with @xmath3 fixed .",
    "corrections @xmath4 can be treated as a small perturbation .",
    "a consequence of this conjecture is that also quark loops can be viewed as a small perturbation , apart from their effect on the scale of the theory .",
    "indeed apart from the loop with two vertices which is proportional to @xmath5 , and which enters in the @xmath6 function , loops with more vertices have additional factors @xmath7 and are negligible . according to this conjecture also the mechanism of confinement and the corresponding order parameter",
    "should then be marginally affected by the presence of quarks . * understanding the ground state is also important to understand why perturbation theory works at small distances .",
    "perturbative quantization describes interaction of quarks and gluons , and the ground state is the fock vacuum .",
    "quarks and gluons are not observed in nature , and the fock vacuum is certainly not the ground state .",
    "this reflects in the renormalized perturbation expansion as a lack of convergence , even in the sense of asymptotic expansion@xcite .",
    "colour is confined in nature .",
    "the expected ratio of abundance of quarks @xmath8 to abundance of nucleons @xmath9 is in the standard cosmological model@xcite @xmath10 the experimental upper limit is @xmath11 coming from millikan like experiments on @xmath12 of matter .",
    "the estimate ( [ eq : e1 ] ) is conservative .",
    "if we assume no confinement and @xmath13 is the temperature at which quarks decouple their effective mass @xmath14 is @xmath15 .",
    "the reactions @xmath16 are esothermic : let @xmath17 the corresponding cross section and @xmath18 . then quarks will decouple when @xmath19 since @xmath20 this implies @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio ( [ eq : e1 ] ) corresponds to @xmath23 .",
    "the factor @xmath24 between the observation and the expectation can not be explained by fine tuning of a small parameter . like the experimental limit on the resistivity of a superconductor , it can only be explained in terms of symmetry .",
    "a suggestive idea in that direction is that vacuum is a dual superconductor @xcite .",
    "the chromoelectric field between a @xmath25 @xmath26 pair is constrained by dual meissner effect into an abrikosov flux tube with energy proportional to the distance .",
    "a relativistic version of the free energy of a superconductor , which is the analog of effective action in field theory , is @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the covariant derivative and @xmath29 is the effective potential . @xmath30 and @xmath31 are funtions of the temperature , and @xmath32 in the superconducting phase , where the potential has a mexican hat shape .",
    "putting @xmath33 , with @xmath34 gives @xmath35 . under a gauge transformation",
    "@xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is gauge invariant .",
    "moreover @xmath39 and the free energy can be rewritten as @xmath40 the equations of motion are @xmath41 a static solution in the gauge @xmath42 has @xmath43 , @xmath44 and eq.([eq : e12 ] ) reads @xmath45 eq .",
    "( [ eq : e13a ] ) means that also in the absence of electric field there is a permanent current , or that @xmath46 .",
    "( [ eq : e13b ] ) is meissner effect : the field @xmath47 penetrates by a length @xmath48 . at large distance from the center of a flux tube @xmath49 or @xmath50 which is the dirac quantization condition .",
    "abrikosov flux tubes have monopoles at their ends .",
    "those phenomena are a consequence of symmetry@xcite : the order parameter is @xmath51 , or the non vanishing v.e.v . of a charged operator",
    ". for dual superconductivity the signal of the phase should be the v.e.v .",
    "@xmath52 of an operator carrying magnetic charge .",
    "lattice produces evidence for confinement .",
    "wilson loops , defined as parallel transport along square contours in space time , provide the static force between @xmath0 pairs , in the limit of large @xmath13 @xmath53 the area law observed in lattice gauge theory@xcite @xmath54 means @xmath55 or that an infinite amount of energy is needed to pull the two particles at infinite distance from each other .",
    "@xmath17 is the string tension , related to the slope of regge trajectories .",
    "also chromoelectric flux tubes between @xmath56 pairs are observed , with transverse size @xmath57@xcite .",
    "the colour orientation of the chromoelectric field inside them can also be studied@xcite .",
    "finally the collective modes of the string formed by the flux tube can be analysed@xcite .",
    "all these facts support the picture of confinement as due to dual superconductivity of vacuum . a microscopic understanding is however needed",
    ". in particular monopoles which condense in the vacuum have to be identified .",
    "in qed , which is a @xmath58 gauge theory , magnetic charges are omitted , since they are not observed in nature . as a consequence the general solution of maxwell s equations can be given in terms of a vector potential @xmath59 .",
    "the field strength tensor @xmath60 obeys the equations @xmath61 the absence of magnetic charges indentically follows from eq.([eq : e18 ] ) .",
    "the dual tensor @xmath62 is , by virtue of eq .",
    "( [ eq : e18 ] ) identically conserved : @xmath63 eq .",
    "( [ eq : e19 ] ) is known as bianchi identity .    the only way to have a monopole and to preserve bianchi identity is @xcite to introduce a singularity , and consider the monopole as the end point of an infinitely thin solenoid ( dirac string ) , which can be made invisible if the parallel transport of any charge @xmath25 around it is trivial or if @xmath64 the line integral is intended on a path which encircles the string and is equal to the magnetic flux , or to @xmath65 the magnetic charge of the monopole .",
    "( [ eq : e20 ] ) implies @xmath66 or @xmath67 , which is the celebrated dirac quantization condition . as a consequence the theory becomes compact .",
    "in non abelian gauge theories , in the familiar multipole expansion the monopole term obeys abelian equation of motion , has a dirac string and a number of independent abelian magnetic charges which is @xmath68 for the gauge group @xmath69@xcite .",
    "the t hooft - polyakov@xcite monopole of the @xmath70 georgi - glashow model obeys this classification .",
    "to understand the monopoles in qcd we shall phrase the classification of ref .",
    "@xcite in the language of ref .",
    "@xcite , or in terms of `` abelian projections '' .",
    "we shall refer to @xmath71 for simplicity : extension to @xmath69 is trivial@xcite .",
    "let @xmath72 be any local operator belonging to the adjoint representation .",
    "we define @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath74 is well defined except at zeros of @xmath75 .",
    "consider the field strength tensor@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 is the covariant derivative .",
    "the coefficient of the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : e21 ] ) is chosen in such a way that the quadratic term @xmath79 cancels with the first term .",
    "both terms are gauge invariant under regular gauge tranformations .",
    "a gauge transformation @xmath80 which brings @xmath74 along the 3 axis @xmath81 , and diagonalizes @xmath72 is called an abelian projection .",
    "after abelian projection @xmath82 is an abelian field .",
    "this holds in all points where @xmath80 is regular . defining the dual tensor @xmath83 as @xmath84",
    "the magnetic current @xmath85 is defined as @xmath86 and is identically conserved .",
    "it is zero except at the singular points of @xmath80 , where monopoles can appear .",
    "thus @xmath87 defines a magnetic @xmath58 symmetry of the theory .",
    "it is not a subgroup of the gauge group since both @xmath88 and @xmath85 are colour singlet .",
    "if the vacuum is not invariant under that @xmath58 symmetry , monopoles condense like the cooper pairs and there is dual superconductivity .",
    "notice that    1 .   there is a magnetic @xmath58 symmetry for each operator @xmath75 in the adjoint representation .",
    "2 .   under the abelian projection @xmath80 , due to singularities , the field strength tensor @xmath89 acquires a singular component @xmath90 the regular part can have monopole sources .",
    "@xmath91 describes dirac strings starting from the monopoles",
    ".    the strategy will then be to detect condensation of different monopole species by measuring with numerical simulations across the deconfining transition a `` disorder '' parameter , which detects dual superconductivity .",
    "the usual order parameter is the polyakov line .",
    "our disorder parameter will be zero in the deconfined phase , where the order parameter is non zero , and different from zero in the confined phase , where it is zero .",
    "the concept of disorder parameter is typical of systems which admit a dual description@xcite .",
    "they usually have extended structures with non trivial topology ( monopoles in qcd ) , which condense in the disordered phase . in a dual description these structures are described by local fields , and the definition of order and disorder is interchanged . before giving the results and a few details on how they have been obtained",
    ", we shall present the expectations .",
    "as we have seen dual superconductivity of the vacuum is not a well defined concept .",
    "there are infinitely many choices for the operator @xmath75 , and for each of them ther can or can not be condensation .",
    "what is the good choice , if any ?    1 .",
    "there is club of practitioners of the `` maximal abelian projection '' , saying that their choice is better than others .",
    "in fact with this choice the abelian field `` dominates '' the configurations , in particular the part of it which is produced by monopoles .",
    "this can prove convenient to attempt a construction of effective lagrangeans , but in principle does not preclude any pattern of symmetry .",
    "2 .   there is a conjecture that all abelian projections are equivalent@xcite .",
    "most probably both attitudes reflect our imperfect knowledge of the symmetry of the disordered phase .",
    "discriminating between ( a ) and ( b ) is possible on the lattice .",
    "the results that we have obtained by a systematic study of dual superconductivity show unambiguously    1 .",
    "that confinement is a transition from normal to dual superconductor ground state .",
    "this is strong evidence that the mechanism of confinement is indeed dual superconductivity of the vacuum .",
    "a few different abelian projections have been analyzed .",
    "all of them show the same behaviour .",
    "the scenario ( b ) seems to be true .",
    "this is reassuring for the validity of the mechanism itself .",
    "if only one abelian projection would show dual superconductivity only the particles with non zero charge with respect to that @xmath58 could be confined : there exist states for which that charge is zero , e.g. the gluon which is parallel to @xmath74 .",
    "moreover the colour direction of the electric field in the flux tubes observed in the lattice should also be parallel to @xmath74 , being the electric partner of the magnetic @xmath58 of the monopoles .",
    "this has been shown to be not true@xcite .",
    "both these facts are naturally explained if the scenario ( b ) is at work .",
    "we conclude by giving a few details on the technique used to detect dual superconductivity .",
    "the technique has been checked in many well known systems showing order disorder duality versus traditional descriptions@xcite .",
    "an operator @xmath92 is constructed which carries non zero magnetic charge with respect to the @xmath58 under study .",
    "finite temperature is realized on the lattice by the usual thermodynamical recipe of having euclidean time running from @xmath93 to @xmath94 ( the temperature ) , with periodic boundary conditions for barions , antiperiodic for fermions . on a lattice",
    "this is done by using a size @xmath95 , with @xmath96 and @xmath97 ( @xmath98 ) . by renormalization group arguments @xmath99 , or @xmath100 .",
