    "although the symmetry of the order parameter in high-@xmath1 superconductivity has not been identified yet , we have some experimental evidences which indicate the @xmath0-wave superconducting state.@xcite since this type of the symmetry is qualitatively different from the conventional @xmath2-wave superconductivity , we can expect some new phenomena in high-@xmath1 superconductivity .",
    "recently , some researchers pointed out the possibility of the @xmath0-wave superconductivity with broken time - reversal symmetry , which results from the @xmath3-wave state near the surface.@xcite in addition , it was discussed that this state has a finite electric surface current.@xcite in this case , we should remark that this state has the following properties :    * the current flows without any external field , i.e. , it appears _ spontaneously_. * the total current is also finite.@xcite    on the other hand , the bloch theorem states _ absence of the stationary current in the ground state with no external field_.@xcite then the above surface current seems inconsistent with this theorem .    motivated by this discrepancy , we study the bloch theorem and its application to this state . the bloch theorem has been examined so far within the framework of the first quantization , which seems disadvantageous to superconductivity .",
    "furthermore , the theorem in case with the magnetic field induced by the spontaneous current has not been examined in detail . for these reasons ,",
    "we present the second quantized version of the bloch theorem , which can directly cover the superconductivity , and also show its extension to the system with the induced magnetic field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in @xmath4 , we examine the bloch theorem neglecting the magnetic field induced by the current , because the spontaneous surface current is reported in this situation.@xcite effects of the induced magnetic field are discussed in @xmath5 , which is followed by the summary in @xmath6 .",
    "in this section , we first of all rederive the bloch theorem from general viewpoint . possibility of the spontaneous surface current is then discussed on the basis of this theorem .",
    "we start with the case of the chargeless ( neutral ) fermion , in which the current does not induce magnetic field .",

    "in what follows , though @xmath16 is not written explicitly in eq .",

    "firstly , we examine the system at @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that the ground state @xmath20 has a finite total current @xmath21 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes a local current . in the following discussion , we show that this assumption of finite @xmath21 leads to a contradiction .",

    "this shows that _ the ground state of the chargeless fermions can not have finite total current .",

    "the state with a finite total current is not thermodynamically stable_.    before ending this section , we briefly note bohm s study for a finite current at @xmath69.@xcite in his proof , the off - diagonal matrix elements of @xmath35 for @xmath56 are dropped by using the properties that ( i ) they are @xmath70 and ( ii ) from the perturbative analysis , they are found to affect the energy at most @xmath65",
    ". however , if there is degeneracy in the diagonal elements and , for example , @xmath71 is realized , ( i , j)-element may affect the energy in @xmath70 .",
    "hence this off - diagonal element can not be neglected within the perturbation theory . on the other hand , since our proof does not rely on the perturbation theory , we do not meet this problem .",
    "recently , the spontaneous surface current has been discussed in unconventional superconductivity .",
    "we examine this problem on the basis of the bloch theorem .",
    "let us consider a semi - infinite system as shown in fig .  1 : presence of the surface is described by putting @xmath72 .",
    "the surface may have a roughness . at the end edges of the system , we take the open boundary condition , so that we can choose arbitrary small @xmath27 .",
    "( the system size is finally put infinity . )",
    "suppose the presence of the spontaneous surface current as shown in fig .",
    "then , what does the bloch theorem state about this situation ?",
    "the answer is that _ there must be another counter current inside the system which cancels the surface one as a whole _",
    "indeed , we can find an example of this situation in the domain wall problem in unconventional superconductivity.@xcite in this example , the local surface currents exist near both the sides of the wall .",
    "they , however , flow toward opposite directions to each other , thereby satisfying the bloch theorem . at this stage , we emphasize that the presence of the counter flow purely results from the bloch theorem and is irrespective to the origin of the surface current .    in the next step ,",
    "we discuss some specific systems in which the spontaneous surface currents are proposed .    *",
    "as noted in the introduction , the surface current which is also finite in total was proposed in a @xmath0-wave superconductivity with broken time - reversal symmetry near the surface.@xcite since the detail of the state , e.g. , whether the time - reversal symmetry is broken or not , does not affect the bloch theorem , we immediately find that it is not stable at all temperatures .",
    "* sigrist _ et .",
    "al . _ also reported the surface current in an unconventional superconductivity with broken time - reversal symmetry.@xcite they showed that the surface flow is canceled by the screening current inside the system resulting from the meissner effect .",
    "apparently , their results do not contradict the bloch theorem .",
    "( exactly speaking , the meissner effect needs the charge of electron , which is neglected in this section . in @xmath73 ,",
    "the bloch theorem is shown to be still valid in the presence of the charge . )",
    "however , we have to note that the meissner effect is not intrinsic origin of the back flow .",
    "the counter current has to appear even for the chargeless electrons where the meissner effect does not work ; the role of the meissner effect is merely determining the distribution of the local current so as to exclude the magnetic field from the superconductor .    before going to the next section , we comment on the boundary condition at the end edges of the system .",
    "one may think that there is not stationary current under the open boundary condition ( isolated system ) ; however , when the thermodynamic limit is taken with appropriate symmetry breaking field , we can safely reach the bulk system in which the stationary current can flow .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that the detail of the boundary condition does not affect the presence of the surface current .",
    "consequently , although we can not examine the cases with arbitrary boundary conditions , the statement that the surface current state is not stable is believed to describe the property of the real system .",
    "we examine the possibility of the circulating flow . in a real system , a circuit as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) is necessary in order to maintain the current . in this case , the total current passing through the line `` a '' in fig .",
    "3(a ) is zero , which looks escaping from the bloch theorem . then , is the spontaneous current possible when the circuit is taken into account ?",
    "bohm proved for a large ring that the ground state must be in zero total angular momentum.@xcite recently , vignale extended bohm s proof to systems with toroidal geometry.@xcite the outline of bohm s proof is as follows : consider a large but thin superconducting ring with the width @xmath74 ( fig .",
    "the ground state @xmath20 is assumed to have a finite total angular momentum as a result of the circulating current .",
    "the trial state is @xmath75 because of the single - value condition of @xmath33 , @xmath76 must be an integer .",
    "we find @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the @xmath79-component of the angular momentum operator .",
    "when the total current is @xmath80 , the angular momentum is estimated as @xmath81",

    "( [ eq.a.2 ] ) are evaluated as @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively .",
    "now , let us examine the case with @xmath84 .",
    "because of @xmath85 , the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq.a.2 ] ) becomes negligible compared with the second one for large @xmath86 .",
    "thus , when we choose @xmath76 so as to be @xmath87 , it is found that @xmath33 has a lower energy than the assumed ground state .",
    "consequently , the state that has a finite angular momentum due to a circulating current with @xmath88 can not be the ground state .    in conclusion , _",
    "even if the circuit is taken into account , the spontaneous current which is proportional to the size along the circuit is not realized in the bulk system . _",
    "in this section , we examine effects of the charge . since the real electron has the charge @xmath89 , the electric current induces magnetic field .",
