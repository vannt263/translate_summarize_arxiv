    "the self - avoiding walk ( saw ) serves as a paradigmatic model in polymer physics ( see e.g. ref . [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "it is equivalent to the @xmath6 limit of the o@xmath7 model @xcite and plays an important role in the study of critical phenomena . in the grand - canonical ensemble ,",
    "the length of a walk can fluctuate and the saw model is defined by the following partition sum @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the length of a walk @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the weight of each unit length , and the summation is over all possible self - avoiding paths . in two and higher dimensions ( d ) , the saw has two distinct phases separated by a critical point @xmath12 .",
    "the length @xmath9 remains finite in the dilute phase with @xmath13 , and becomes divergent in the dense region with @xmath14 .",
    "markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) methods have been extensively used in the simulation of the saw @xcite .",
    "the balance condition ( bc ) and the ergodicity are two key factors in designing a mcmc algorithm .",
    "the bc states that the probability flow entering into a configuration equals the flow out of the configuration .",
    "thus , it ensures a stationary distribution .",
    "then , ergodicity ensures convergence to the distribution @xcite . in practice ,",
    "the bc is typically satisfied by employing the detailed balance condition ( dbc ) , which implies that the probability flow from one configuration to another is equal to the reverse flow , i.e. the dynamics is reversible .    in recent years",
    ", there have been several successful studies @xcite that show a promising future for mcmc algorithms beyond the dbc .",
    "geometric allocation approaches have been applied to the potts model @xcite ; irreversible mcmc methods have been designed for the mean - field ising model @xcite ; event - chain monte carlo ( ecmc ) methods have been proposed for the simulation of hard - sphere systems @xcite and generalized to particle systems with arbitrary pairwise interactions @xcite , including soft - disk systems @xcite , the xy model @xcite and the heisenberg model @xcite .",
    "near the phase transition point , the geometric allocation method outperforms the standard metropolis - hastings ( mh ) method by @xmath15 times for the @xmath16 square lattice potts model , and its performance increases with @xmath17 @xcite . for the mean - field ising model",
    ", the irreversible mcmc method has a dynamic exponent @xmath18 , which is considerably smaller than @xmath19 for the reversible mh method @xcite . in comparison with the mh method ,",
    "the speedup of the ecmc method reaches two orders of magnitude in large systems consisting of @xmath20 hard spheres @xcite . for the 3d ferromagnetic heisenberg model",
    ", it has been reported that the ecmc method has a dynamic exponent @xmath21 , in contrast to @xmath22 for the mh method @xcite .    for a monte carlo markov chain , let @xmath23 be the weight of a configuration @xmath10 , @xmath24 be the a priori probability of proposing a transition from a configuration @xmath10 to another @xmath25 , and @xmath26 be the probability of accepting the proposal .",
    "one obtains the stationary probability flow @xmath27 .",
    "the dbc states that for any pair of @xmath10 and @xmath25 , @xmath28 .",
    "instead , the bc requires that for any @xmath10 , @xmath29 , with the summation over all possible configurations @xmath25 . without the dbc ,",
    "net probability flows can exist between two states @xmath10 and @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath30 , and the probability fluxes make circles in a phase space @xcite .",
    "while local probability flow circles are introduced in the geometric allocation approach , considerably larger or even global circles can appear in other methods beyond the dbc .",
    "this is achieved through a lifting technique , which enlarges the phase space by an auxiliary variable . as a result",
    ", the system can be at different modes specified by different values of the auxiliary variable . within a given mode",
    ", an a priori direction of monte carlo updates is preferred , and net probability flow may exist .",
    "the bc is recovered by allowing switches between different modes , and the probability flow can satisfy a skew detailed balance ( see e.g. refs .  ) .",
    "for example , the phase space for the mean - field ising model @xcite is doubled and denoted as the decreasing and increasing modes . in the first mode , only the positive spins are flipped and total magnetization @xmath31 decreases , whereas in the second mode , @xmath31 increases by only allowing the flip of negative spins .",
    "updates can persist very far in one mode until a spin - flip proposal is rejected , after which the updates are switched to the other mode .",
    "this leads to large probability flow circles , and the diffusive feature of random updates is suppressed or even replaced by ballistic - like behavior .",
    "it is noted that while the efficiency for the mean - field ising model improves qualitatively , the lifting technique does not help significantly for the 2d ising model @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we design an irreversible mcmc algorithm for the saw by employing the lifting technique .",
    "the update direction is selected such that the length @xmath9 increases in one mode and decreases in the other .",
    "the two modes are  linked \" to each other through switching . for practical coding ,",
    "only a few lines need be added to the widely - used berretti - sokal ( bs ) algorithm , a simple variant of the mh method @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , numerical results show that the irreversible mcmc method is considerably superior to the bs algorithm .",
    "we use this new method to explore the finite - size scaling ( fss ) of the 5d saw , above the upper critical dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the critical point is located with high precision .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec_mh ] , we review a few monte carlo methods for the saw , including the conventional mh algorithm and the bs method .",
    "section  [ sec_il ] describes the irreversible mcmc algorithm .",
    "we compare the performances of these algorithms in sec .",
    "[ sec_per ] .",
    "section  [ sec_fss ] contains a fss analysis for the saw on a periodic hypercubic lattice in five dimensions . a brief conclusion and discussion",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_con_dis ] .",
    "we review below the mh and bs algorithms for the saw , which employ the dbc and are reversible .    *",
    "[ metropolis - hastings algorithm . ] * given a regular @xmath33-dimensional lattice with coordination number @xmath34 , a saw @xmath10 , with length @xmath35 , is a sequence of @xmath36 lattice sites connected via a chain of occupied edges . for simplicity ,",
    "we fix an end of the walk at the origin and denote the movable end by @xmath37 .",
    "the mh algorithm @xcite is a standard reversible mcmc algorithm , constructed as follows .    ' '' ''    * metropolis - hastings algorithm *    1 .",
    "randomly select one of the @xmath34 neighboring sites of @xmath37 , e.g. , @xmath38 , and propose a symmetric update of the edge in between , which flips an empty edge to be occupied , and vice versa .",
    "2 .   if the update leads to a valid saw @xmath25 , accept the proposal with probability @xmath39 .    ' '' ''    the weight @xmath23 of a configuration is just given by eq .",
    "( [ partition_sum ] ) as @xmath40 , and the acceptance probabilities are @xmath41 where @xmath42 . here",
    ", the a priori probability is a constant @xmath43 , independent of @xmath44 .",
    "the dbc can be easily proven .    *",
    "[ berretti - sokal algorithm . ] * on a lattice with large coordination number @xmath34 ( e.g. , a high - dimensional lattice ) , the critical point of the saw occurs at @xmath45 .",
    "this implies that in the above mh algorithm a typical update would attempt to flip an empty edge but fail , and is thus ineffective .",
    "a more efficient mh algorithm for saws is the bs method @xcite , which employs a different scheme for a priori probabilities . a version of the bs algorithm , slightly different from that in ref .",
    ", is described below .    ' '' ''    * berretti - sokal algorithm *    1 .",
    "choose action : propose with equal probability the  add \" action @xmath46 for @xmath47 and the  delete \" action @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "2 .   perform action : * for action @xmath46 , randomly occupy with probability @xmath50 one of the @xmath51 empty edges if it leads a valid saw . * for action @xmath48 , delete with probability @xmath52 the last occupied edge , incident to @xmath37 .    ' '' ''    note that an empty edge is chosen with probability @xmath53 while the occupied edge is chosen with probability @xmath54 .",
    "the dbc condition leads to the metropolis acceptance probabilities as @xmath55 near the critical point , the acceptance probabilities are close to unity . in the original version @xcite ,",
    "a priori probabilities are slightly further optimized such that the bs algorithm becomes rejection - free .",
    "it is noted that some special attention is needed for the case of a  null \" walk with @xmath56 , in which there are @xmath34 empty incident edges instead of @xmath57 . for simplicity",
    ", we simply permanently delete an edge incident to the original site .",
    "the diffusive feature of the bs algorithm is rather obvious : particularly for @xmath58 , a saw with length @xmath59 will have length @xmath60 in the next step with approximately equal probabilities .",
    "a direct approach toward an irreversible method is to double the state space of the saw by introducing an auxiliary variable with two values @xmath61 and @xmath62 . in the increasing mode @xmath61 , action @xmath48",
    "is forbidden and the walk length @xmath59 increases because of action @xmath46 . in contrast",
    ", @xmath59 decreases in the decreasing mode @xmath62 .",
    "the balance condition is satisfied by allowing switching between the two modes .",
    "figure [ fig_illu ] shows a sketch of the associated probability flows .",
    "the formulation of the irreversible algorithm is considerably similar to the above bs method , as illustrated below .    ' '' ''    * irreversible algorithm *    * for the increasing mode @xmath61 , perform action @xmath46 with probability @xmath63 . randomly select and occupy one of the @xmath51 empty edges if this leads to a valid saw ; otherwise , switch to the decreasing mode @xmath62 .",
    "* for the decreasing mode @xmath62 , perform action @xmath48 with probability @xmath64 . delete the last occupied edge in the saw if @xmath65 ; otherwise , switch to the increasing mode @xmath61 .    ' '' ''    the acceptance probabilities , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , can also be given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - pdec ] ) . for the case where @xmath68 , the saw grows with probability @xmath69 in the increasing mode @xmath61 , and it is deleted until @xmath56 in the decreasing mode @xmath62 . for the case",
    "where @xmath70 , which includes the critical point @xmath12 , one obtains @xmath71 .",
    "thus in the increasing mode @xmath61 , the saw grows until it violates the self - avoidance , after which it switches to the decreasing mode @xmath62 , where the chain decreases with probability @xmath72 . at the critical point @xmath12",
    ", @xmath67 is close to but smaller than one , for example @xmath73 in 5d .",
    "thus , instead of returning to @xmath56 and growing again , it decreases for a considerably long time , then it switches to the increasing mode @xmath61 and grows again .",
    "it is clear that the diffusive feature of monte carlo updates in the state space is significantly suppressed .",
    "we demonstrate below the balance condition for the case where @xmath74 , using the acceptance probabilities given by eq .",
    "( [ eq - pdec ] ) ; the proof for @xmath75 follows the same procedure .",
    "consider a @xmath59-step saw in the increasing mode @xmath61 , the incoming probability flow from the @xmath76-step saw is @xmath77 x^ { { { \\mathcal n}}-1 } p^{+ } = x^ { { \\mathcal n}}\\;.\\ ] ] the factor @xmath78 accounts for the probability for selecting the particular edge leading to the current saw . the incoming probability flow due to the switch from mode @xmath62 is equal to zero unless @xmath56 : @xmath79 .",
    "the total outgoing probabilities flows are clearly @xmath80 , since no action is allowed to keep the configuration unchanged . in the next step , there is an @xmath81-step saw in mode @xmath61 or an @xmath59-step saw in mode @xmath62 .",
    "more specifically , suppose that occupying one of @xmath82 $ ] empty edges would lead to a valid saw , the outgoing probability flow is @xmath83 x^ { { \\mathcal n}}p^+ = z ' x^ { { { \\mathcal n}}+1 } $ ] and the switch probability flow is @xmath84 .",
    "thus , the balance condition in the increasing mode @xmath61 is obviously satisfied as @xmath85 the same procedure follows for the bc in mode @xmath62 .",

    "we develop an irreversible mcmc algorithm for the saw . it violates the dbc , and satisfies the weaker bc . in comparison with the standard mh algorithm and one of its variants , i.e. , the bs algorithm ,",
    "the irreversible method is considerably more efficient .",
    "while the bs algorithm is approximately @xmath33 times more efficient than the standard mh algorithm , the irreversible algorithm is further superior to the bs algorithm .",
    "the higher is the spatial dimension , the more is the gain of efficiency .",
    "this is because the critical saw is more like the ordinary random walk in higher dimensions , and thus the diffusive feature is more suppressed in the irreversible algorithm .    using the irreversible mcmc algorithm for the saw , we perform an independent and accurate test of the renormalized exponents @xmath90 and @xmath4 in the fss behavior of systems in the o(@xmath91 universality class with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "we also provide an estimate @xmath92 for the 5d saw , which is @xmath5 times more precise than the best available estimate .",
    "we believe that the irreversible mcmc algorithm for the saw will make an important contribution toward a deeper understanding of the fss behavior above the upper critical dimension , particularly for systems with free boundary conditions .",
    "this irreversible mcmc algorithm must also be very valuable in studying interacting saw @xcite , polymeric systems and other soft matters .",
    "similar irreversible tricks can be introduced into other algorithms like the worm algorithm @xcite .",
