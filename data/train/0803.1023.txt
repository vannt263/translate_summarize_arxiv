    "cyclic competition among different phenotypes is often found in nature .",
    "a minimal system of cyclic competition consists of individuals of three phenotypes . in so - called rock - scissors - paper ( rsp ) dynamics , r beats s , s beats p , and p beats r , hence no phenotype is entirely dominant .",
    "examples of natural rsp dynamics include tropical marine ecosystems @xcite , color polymorphism of natural lizards @xcite , vertebrate ecosystems in high - arctic areas @xcite , real microbial communities of _ escherichia coli _",
    "@xcite , and various disease dynamics represented by the susceptible - infected - recovered - susceptible model or its variants @xcite .    also in evolutionary game theory",
    ", cyclic competition dynamics realized by three or more strategies often appear . in social dilemma games such as the prisoner",
    "s dilemma , cyclic competition often underlies the survival of altruistic strategies subject to invasion by nonaltruistic strategies .",
    "for example , if the players can take either unconditional cooperation ( allc ) or unconditional defection ( alld ) in the prisoner s dilemma , alld eventually prevails .",
    "however , if discriminators that use reputation of other players regarding the cooperation tendency are allowed , allc , alld , and discriminators form an rsp cycle ; alld is stronger than allc , allc and discriminators are neutral , and discriminators are stronger than alld under certain conditions .",
    "accordingly , these strategies alternately prosper in the population , which implies survival of altruistic players , namely , allc and discriminators @xcite . alternatively , if players can choose not to play the public goods games , such players called loners beat alld , alld beats allc , and allc beats loners .",
    "the elicited rsp dynamics save altruistic allc players , which would not survive without loners @xcite . in the iterated prisoner s",
    "dilemma , a mixture of allc , alld , and tit - for - tat ( tft ) constitutes rsp dynamics so that altruism survives under small mutation rates @xcite .",
    "finally , a population of different types of strategies , each of which is based only on the last actions of players , shows periodic and chaotic oscillations of population densities associated with cyclic competition @xcite .    as illustrated by these examples , an important consequence of cyclically competing evolutionary dynamics is oscillations of population densities .",
    "each strategy or phenotype alternately becomes the majority until it is devoured by its enemy .",
    "oscillations are usually self - destructive in small populations because the finite - size effect usually drives the evolutionary dynamics to eventual dominance of one of the competing phenotypes @xcite .",
    "if the model represents a ecosystem , dominance of one species implies a loss of biodiversity . in social dilemma games , a situation in which one strategy wins",
    "cyclic competition often implies a loss of altruism ; in many models , an altruistic strategy is relatively weak compared to others and beats another strategy only barely @xcite .",
    "if oscillations are stabilized or suppressed , cyclically competing strategies will coexist in a population .",
    "oscillations can be suppressed by introduction of spatial structure such as the square lattice @xcite . in line with this ,",
    "oscillation amplitudes grow as the underlying population structure transits from the regular lattice to the well - mixed population by increasing the number of long - range edges @xcite ( see @xcite for more references ) .",
    "alternatively , heterogeneous contact rates of individuals suppress oscillations . in this scenario , hubs ,",
    "namely , individuals with many neighbors , are more susceptible to invasion by their enemies , because hubs have many enemies in the neighborhood than non - hubs on average .",
    "then hubs complete a state - transition cycle in shorter periods .",
    "mixture of individuals with different oscillation periods abolishes the oscillation of the entire population density @xcite .",
    "an implicit assumption made by these and many other studies of cyclic competition @xcite is that a focal individual is invaded by each enemy neighbor independently at a constant rate .",
    "for example , if a focal individual is in state r and it has 10 neighbors , the state of the focal individual is replaced by state p , which governs r , at a rate proportional to the number of p among the 10 neighbors . in other words , each p individual preys on each r neighbor independently at a constant rate .",
    "the contributions of different p individuals add linearly .",
    "in evolutionary games , however , the effect of each neighbor adds linearly in the sense that the aggregated payoff of the focal player over is the linear sum of the payoff obtained by playing with each neighbor .",
    "then natural selection operates on the aggregated payoff in a nonlinear manner . here",
    "how one player elicits state transition of another player is not straightforward .",
    "in addition , suppression of oscillations by the heterogeneity mechanism requires that the number of contacts , or neighbors , depends on individuals @xcite . in the context of evolutionary games",
    ", heterogeneous contact numbers also pave the way to increased altruism @xcite .",
    "in this situation , enhanced cooperation stems from players with many contacts , who earn more by participating in the game more often .",
    "however , how to compare aggregated payoffs of players with different numbers of participation is an unresolved issue @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we explore how oscillations in rsp dynamics can be stabilized or suppressed in evolutionary games . to avoid the problem of the heterogeneous number of contact per player",
    ", we consider a well - mixed population and assume that the adaptation rate , but not the contact number , depends on players .",
    "some players are quicker to copy successful strategies than others .",
    "such heterogeneous adaptation rates are known to enhance cooperation in the evolutionary prisoner s dilemma on the regular lattices and small - world networks @xcite . by extending the replicator dynamics ,",
    "we show that heterogeneous adaptation rates suppress oscillations of population densities in well - mixed populations .",
    "we validate our theory by numerical simulations of the rsp games and the public goods game with loners @xcite .",
    "we begin with the standard replicator dynamics .",
    "suppose that there are @xmath0 possible phenotypes , which we call strategies .",
    "the proportion of individuals , which we call players , with strategy @xmath1 in the population of @xmath2 players is denoted by @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) are always satisfied .",
    "the fitness of strategy @xmath1 is denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the standard replicator dynamics are represented by @xmath8 where we suppress the range of @xmath9 when no confusion arises .",
    "players with strategy @xmath1 increase in number at a rate proportional to the excess of @xmath7 relative to the average fitness @xmath10 .",
    "put another way , a player with strategy @xmath9 switches its strategy to strategy @xmath1 of a randomly picked opponent at a rate proportional to the fitness difference @xmath11 , if @xmath12 . if @xmath13 , players with strategy @xmath1 may switch to strategy @xmath9 .",
    "the players are interpreted to form a well - mixed population .",
    "we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ eq : repl ] ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : g ] ) represents the inflow of the population density to strategy @xmath1 and the second term represents the outflow from @xmath1 to other strategies . note that @xmath16 is satisfied .",
    "we extend the standard replicator dynamics by considering a heterogeneous population of players who differ in the adaptation rate .",
    "for simplicity , we assume only two adaptation rates @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the corresponding proportions of each strategy in two different subpopulations are specified by @xmath3 and @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21 , and @xmath22 ( @xmath4 ) . in a homogeneous population , the adaptation rate , which is common to all the players ,",
    "can be ignored by rescaling the time , as is evident in eq .",
    "( [ eq : repl ] ) . with two adaptation rates ,",
    "the ratio @xmath23 is an essential parameter that may alter dynamical consequences .",
    "note that the interaction rate is common to all the players , which contrasts with taylor and nowak ( 2006 ) .",
    "if one strategy is more profitable than another strategy irrespective of the values of @xmath3 and @xmath19 ( @xmath4 ) , players that adapt more rapidly enjoy more benefits .",
    "for example , in the prisoner s dilemma with allc and alld strategies only , everybody in a well - mixed population will choose alld . rapidly adapting allc players switch to alld in early stages to transiently exploit slowly adapting allc players",
    ". however , under cyclic competition , it may not be profitable to myopically follow apparently successful others . in a long term , players may be better off by adapting slowly .",
    "we assume that players differ only in adaptation rates and that they are well - mixed .",
    "therefore , the total payoff of a player with strategy @xmath1 is equal to @xmath7 regardless of the adaptation rate .",
    "we represent the extended replicator dynamics as follows : @xmath24 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : repl - extended1 ] ) , the first term in the right - hand side represents the competition within players that have adaptation rate @xmath17 . this part is identical to the standard replicator dynamics .",

    "players with strategy @xmath9 and adaptation rate @xmath17 , whose density is @xmath25 , switch to strategy @xmath1 when they meet a player with strategy @xmath1 and adaptation rate @xmath18 . the transition rate is proportional to @xmath26 . note that the transition from @xmath9 to @xmath1 such that players with strategy @xmath1 and adaptation rate @xmath17 are imitated is taken care of by the first term .",
    "the third term represents the rate at which players with strategy @xmath1 and adaptation rate @xmath17 switch to strategy @xmath9 when they meet a player with strategy @xmath9 and adaptation rate @xmath18 .",

    "cyclic competition often yields coexistence of all the relevant strategies .",
    "interested in this phenomenon , we focus on interior equilibria , which satisfy @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) . in the standard replicator dynamics shown in eq .",

    "only the proportion of each strategy with different adaptation rates pooled , namely , @xmath48 , is determined by the equilibrium condition .",
    "to avoid this ambiguity , we introduce a realistic assumption for @xmath45 . because of bounded cognitive ability and stochastic environments , players may mimic strategies of unsuccessful others with small probabilities . this factor can be implemented by allowing @xmath49 for @xmath50 @xcite .",

    "altruistic strategies that are relatively weak in the rsp relation are expelled in finite populations , even if they can survive in infinite populations . the public goods game with voluntary participation investigated in sec .",
    "[ sub : volu ] is such an example .",
    "heterogeneity saves rare strategies particularly in small populations ( up to the order of 100 players ) .",
    "in addition to heterogeneous adaptation rates , there are mechanisms that sustain rare strategies in evolutionary dynamics with cyclic competition .",
    "one is spatial structure of contact networks , as explained in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] @xcite .",
    "another important mechanism is mutation .",
    "no strategy dies out in the presence of mutation because mutation decreases the proportions of major strategies and increases those of rare and absent strategies .",
    "actually , mutation establishes oscillations and is a key to altruism in the iterated prisoner s dilemma with cyclically competing three strategies , that is , allc , alld , and tft @xcite .",
    "we have neglected mutation in this work .",
    "mutation - induced oscillations , which imply coexistence of multiple strategies , and oscillations by heterogeneous adaptation rates are consistent .",
    "when mutation creates an oscillation in otherwise nonoscillatory evolutionary dynamics , the amplitude of an oscillation is fairly large because a mutation rate is typically small .",
    "a large oscillation amplitude implies that , in most of the time , the proportion of at least one strategy is very small @xcite . with this case",
    "included , heterogeneity lessens the oscillation amplitude so that the proportion of each strategy does not fluctuate so much in time .      to test our theory , we examined two numerical models in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] .",
    "one is the standard rsp game that directly corresponds to the analytical model in sec .",
    "[ sec : rsp - analytical ] .",
    "the other is the public goods game with voluntary participation @xcite .",
    "there are other evolutionary games in which oscillations derived from cyclic competition are observed .",
    "examples include the prisoner s dilemma with a mixture of different memory - one strategies @xcite , a seminal model of indirect reciprocity @xcite , and the iterated prisoner s dilemma with misimplementation of the action @xcite . in these models , three or more strategies including altruistic strategies alternately prosper in infinite well - mixed populations . by additional numerical simulations ,",
    "these dynamics were examined with @xmath149 and heterogeneous adaptation rates .",
    "however , it was impossible to stabilize the oscillatory dynamics with the ranges of parameter values probed ( results not shown ) .",
    "we conjecture that this failure is caused by the extreme asymmetry inherent in these rsp dynamics . to illustrate ,",
    "suppose a population with homogeneous adaptation rates .",
    "by symmetric rsp dynamics , we mean those defined by the payoff matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - nonzerosum3 ] ) .",
    "the corresponding dynamics of the population densities are schematically depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsp_triangle](a ) so that the interior equilibrium is located in the center of the simplex .",
    "each point in the simplex specifies a density profile of different strategies .",
    "a point close to the corner labeled 1 , for example , corresponds to a population that contains relatively many players with strategy 1 .",
    "the symmetric or quasi symmetric rsp dynamics are often employed in the context of interacting particle systems as well as evolutionary games @xcite .",
    "an example of heavily asymmetric , or skewed , rsp dynamics is depicted in fig .  [ fig : rsp_triangle](b ) . to complete a cycle",
    ", the trajectory has to proceed through a narrow canal between the interior equilibrium and the heteroclinic path on which only strategies 2 and 3 exist ( the bottom line of the triangle ) . accordingly , the proportion of strategy 1 is close to zero for some significant time in each cycle .",
    "such heavily skewed rsp dynamics are identified in literature @xcite and may be widely found in evolutionary games .",
    "because trajectories for a population of small to intermediate size accompany considerable fluctuation , it likely hits the heteroclinic path so that the rare strategy ( strategy 1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : rsp_triangle](b ) ) perishes .",
    "if the location of the interior equilibrium and trajectories derived from an infinite - population theory are extremely skewed , oscillatory dynamics will not be realized in finite populations . because the heterogeneous adaptation rate does not change the position of the equilibrium ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : rsp - analytical ] and @xcite ) , heterogeneity does not widen the canal .",
    "although mutation kicks trajectories that have fallen onto the heteroclinic path back to the interior of the simplex , the rare strategy is perpetually subject to extinction .",
    "the heterogeneity mechanism discovered here will work out for rsp dynamics that are not extremely skewed .",
