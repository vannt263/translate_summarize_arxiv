    "the interest in novel frustrated magnets is continuously increasing because of the diversity of their crystal structures and magnetic configurations leading in turn to many interesting phenomena that may be relevant to applications , such as spintronics.@xcite for example , systems composed of @xmath2 spins on a two - dimensional kagome - type lattice are usually strongly frustrated due to competing exchange couplings that give rise to various exotic ground - states and peculiar properties at finite temperatures and in applied magnetic fields.@xcite    due to difficulties in synthesizing inorganic compounds with a low - dimensional arrangement of transition - metal cations , one usually resorts to special strategies for their construction .",
    "for instance , inorganic polyanionic groups can be used as a crystal structure spacer to form open volumes excluding bonding along one or two directions of the crystal structure . an ideal candidate for this purpose",
    "are the stereochemically active lone - pair cations ( se@xmath3 or bi@xmath4 ) , which are large enough to expand crystal structure and form bonds only with oxygen ions.@xcite moreover , halogens are also often used , as they typically have low coordination numbers and additionally act as terminating species.@xcite    cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1x with x = cl , br and i , hereinafter referred to as cbsoox , are geometrically frustrated layered compounds with non - collinear magnetic ordering.@xcite they can be derived from the natural mineral francisite and crystallize in the orthorhombic @xmath5 structure .",
    "this structure can be described as formed by copper(ii)-oxygen layers with two nonequivalent copper sites .",
    "cu1 and cu2 of the site symmetries @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively , that build up a hexagonal network of cuo@xmath8 square plaquettes linked together by se@xmath3 and bi@xmath9 ions with different out - of - plane oxygen bonding .",
    "this geometry can be regarded as a buckled kagome - type lattice .",
    "anisotropic magnetic properties of cbsoox were studied by bulk magnetization measurements@xcite and single - crystal neutron diffraction@xcite that revealed the magnetic ordering transition at @xmath10  k. in zero field , is ordered antiferromagnetically .",
    "magnetic moments on the cu2 sites point along the @xmath11 axis , whereas those on the cu1 sites are canted from @xmath11 towards @xmath12 , thus producing the net magnetic moment within each layer in the @xmath13 plane .",
    "these moments cancel out macroscopically because of the weakly antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling that can be overridden by a magnetic field @xmath14 t applied along the @xmath15 axis .",
    "external field triggers a metamagnetic transition , wherein magnetic moments in every second layer flip , and the net magnetic moment is formed macroscopically.@xcite qualitatively similar behavior was observed for the cl compound@xcite , although no details of its magnetic structure were reported .",
    "rousochatzakis  _ _ et al.__@xcite used density - functional calculations to derive isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings in kagome francisites .",
    "they have shown that the canted spin order in the @xmath13 plane originates from the competition between ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor ( @xmath16k ) and antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor ( @xmath17k ) interactions .",
    "the leading dzyaloshinsky - moriya component along the @xmath18 direction ( @xmath19 in the notation of ref .  ) restricts spins to the @xmath20 plane .",
    "however , the alignment of the net moment with the @xmath11 direction could not be reproduced , and details of the anisotropic magnetization process were not described quantitatively .",
    "recent studies revealed new unusual features of kagome francisites .",
    "for example , these compounds exhibit field- and temperature - dependent microwave absorption over a broad range of frequencies .",
    "this effect can be used for microwave filtering@xcite and calls for a quantitative microscopic description of the magnetization process . in the following",
    ", we will show how this description can be achieved .",
    "the novelty of our approach lies in the direct treatment of the electronic hamiltonian , where all isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings are included implicitly .",
    "we then use the same band structure to derive parameters of the effective spin hamiltonian , and demonstrate salient differences between these two approaches .",
    "electronic - structure calculations have been performed in terms of the conventional local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite and projected augmented waves ( paw ) formalisms@xcite , as implemented in the vienna ab - initio simulation package.@xcite hopping parameters including the spin - orbit interaction have been calculated in the quantum - espresso package.@xcite in our calculations , we adopt the experimental crystallographic data obtained from single - crystal x - ray diffraction studies ( fig .",
    "1a).@xcite    the lda band structure of cbsoox is presented in fig .",
    "one of the most important features of the electronic structure is the presence of six bands located near the fermi level and well separated from the rest of the spectrum .",
    "the main contribution to these bands comes from copper @xmath21 states , which are strongly hybridized with oxygen @xmath22 orbitals .",
    "there is also a small contribution coming from selenium and bismuth ions . to parametrize the lda results ,",
    "we have constructed the maximally - localized wannier functions centered on the copper sites by projecting the bloch states located near the fermi level onto @xmath23 orbitals.@xcite as one can see from fig .",
    "1c , every two wannier functions overlap only on one oxygen site ( o1 ) giving rise to the so - called coulomb contribution to the total exchange.@xcite the resulting functions have a noticeable contribution from both oxygen and selenium atomic orbitals , so they can be roughly expressed as the following linear combinations : @xmath24 and @xmath25 for cu1 and cu2 types , respectively , where contributions from bismuth and halogen orbitals are supposed to be negligible .",
    "these expansion coefficients for the wannier functions can be estimated by using magnetic moments obtained from lsda+u calculations .",
    ".magnetic moments ( in @xmath26 ) of cu@xmath0bi(seo@xmath0)@xmath1o@xmath1x obtained from the lsda+u calculations for the ferromagnetic configuration .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     by applying symmetry operations of the @xmath5 space group , it follows that the magnetic ground state corresponds to the @xmath27 representation for both cu sites .",
    "this representation allows for an additional canting out of the @xmath20 plane , and , according to ref .",
    ", this canting should be indeed present in kagome francisites , although it has not been detected in the experiment so far .",
    "indeed , our zero - field ground state derived from the hartree - fock solution of the electronic hamiltonian features a weak out - of - plane canting @xmath28 and @xmath29 for x = cl and br , respectively .",
    "the out - of - plane canting involves only the cu1 spins and is much smaller than the in - plane canting .    in the case of an external magnetic field @xmath30",
    ", the zero - field afm ground state is followed by a high - field ferrimagnetic state with the critical field @xmath31 t and @xmath32 t for x = cl and br , respectively ( fig .",
    "3b ) , in agreement with the experimental value of @xmath33 t.@xcite since the afm components are still present , we do not observe a full saturation to the fm state . for the magnetic fields along the @xmath18 and @xmath12 axes , no metamagnetic transitions are observed , and the magnetic moments change continuously in each layer . in the case of @xmath34 , which acts against @xmath35 and turns the magnetic moments out of the @xmath20 plane , we get an almost linear behaviour of the magnetization up to @xmath36 t and @xmath37 t for x = cl and br , respectively , that is close to the ( extrapolated ) experimental value of @xmath38 t.@xcite for @xmath39 , which changes the direction of the net moment without flipping spins out of the @xmath20 plane , the magnetization increases faster . net moments of individual layers are polarized at @xmath40 t and @xmath41 t for x = cl and br , respectively , that is close to the experimental value of @xmath42 t.@xcite the smaller slope of the magnetization with respect to the magnetic field @xmath34 is a result of the dominant @xmath18 component of @xmath35 .",
    "we are now in a position to compare our hartree - fock solution of the electronic hamiltonian to the effective spin hamiltonian obtained from the _ same _ lda+so band structure . to this end",
    ", we use several characteristic parameters derived in ref .  .",
    "the primary canting angle @xmath43 and the out - of - plane canting angle @xmath44 are given by : @xmath45 and @xmath46 the slopes of the magnetization curves for @xmath47 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath48 and @xmath49 , as follows : @xmath50 @xmath51/\\sin^{3}{\\theta}}.\\ ] ] finally , the slope of the magnetization curves for @xmath52 is defined by the work @xmath53 required for polarizing spins in the field : @xmath54 in table  [ tab : comparison ] , we also list experimental values along with the results of ref .  , where parameters of the spin hamiltonian are obtained from lda+u+so calculations .",
    "the values based on the spin hamiltonian parametrized via lda+so or lda+u+so calculations are qualitatively very similar , while minor quantitative differences can be traced back to different band - structure codes .",
    "the most tangible discrepancy is seen for the primary canting angle @xmath43 , where lda+so underestimates the canting because of the overestimated ferromagnetic couplings @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this overestimate is likely related to the approximate nature of eq .",
    "( [ eq : fm ] ) for non-90@xmath57 ferromagnetic superexchange .",
    "the hartree - fock solution of the electronic hamiltonian mitigates the problem of the ferromagnetic superexchange and results in the realistic value of @xmath43 .",
    "even more importantly , this solution largely improves the description of the magnetization curves , where , for example , lda+so and lda+u+so underestimate @xmath53 by an order of magnitude .",
    "the hartree - fock solution correctly puts spins on the cu2 atoms ( and thus the net moment ) along the @xmath11 axis , which is not expected from the spin hamiltonian , where both @xmath58- and @xmath15-components of @xmath59 ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 in the notation of ref .  )",
    "are clearly non - negligible suggesting a tilted direction of the net moment in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "we have shown that the spin hamiltonian approach has its limitations for description of the magnetic anisotropy in kagome francisites .",
    "deficiencies of the spin hamiltonian are related to the fact that only the leading isotropic and anisotropic exchange couplings were included in the theoretical analysis of ref .  .",
    "for example , symmetric components of the anisotropy , albeit weak , can also affect spin directions and peculiarities of the magnetization process , but in a complex system like francisite the inclusion of the symmetric anisotropy renders the spin hamiltonian cumbersome and makes the whole problem intractable for analytical or numerical solution . in this case",
    ", the hartree - fock solution of the electronic hamiltonian provides a viable alternative that delivers ground - state magnetic configuration both in zero and applied magnetic fields , so that the magnetization process can be modeled .",
    "our approach also has its limitations .",
    "effects of thermal fluctuations are not included , such that only zero - temperature behavior is analyzed , while at zero temperature effects of quantum fluctuations are largely neglected .",
    "on the other hand , both problems could be solved by a numerical treatment of the spin hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , the approaches based on spin and electronic hamiltonians are complimentary .",
    "together they can deliver complete microscopic picture of a magnetic material that has now been achieved for kagome francisites .    _",
