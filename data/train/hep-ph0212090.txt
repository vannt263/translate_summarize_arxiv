    "many mass matrix models in the literature@xcite attempt to explain only the recent mass and mixing data in the lepton sector .",
    "more ambitious attempts introduce supersymmetric grand unified ( susy gut ) models to understand both the lepton and quark sectors . in this brief review my attention",
    "is restricted to four - dimensional three family so(10 ) gut models with no light sterile neutrinos .",
    "one finds that several models are presently quite successful in explaining the data , including the preferred lma solar neutrino solution .",
    "one model is illustrated in some detail , while future critical tests of the presently successful models are described .",
    "it is well known that the three families of left - handed quarks and leptons and their left - handed charge conjugates fit neatly into three copies of the so(10 ) spinor representation , @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , this feature is what has made so(10 ) so attractive as a unification group .",
    "higgs fields appearing in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 are needed to break so(10 ) to the standard model .",
    "the two light higgs doublets which are required to break the electroweak symmetry can be accommodated by a single @xmath4 of so(10 ) , which consists of a @xmath5 of su(5 ) or a @xmath6 of su(4 ) @xmath7",
    "su(2)@xmath8 @xmath7 su(2)@xmath9 .",
    "doublet - triplet splitting of the higgs fields is required and can be achieved via the dimopoulos - wilczek mechanism,@xcite if the @xmath10 vev points in the @xmath11 direction . with only one @xmath4 effecting the electroweak breaking , @xmath12 .",
    "the above represents the essential ingredients of an so(10 ) model",
    ". however , many authors have found it desirable to introduce additional higgs fields .",
    "for example , an additional @xmath13 pair can help to stabilize the double - triplet splitting solution.@xcite if the vev @xmath14 , the light higgs doublet , @xmath15 , can reside in both the vector and spinor representations , i.e. , @xmath16 so that yukawa coupling unification is possible for any value in the range @xmath17 .",
    "similar results are also possible with the addition of a @xmath18 pair in place of the @xmath13 pair of higgs fields",
    ".    it may also be desirable to introduce @xmath19 pairs , @xmath20 s , etc .",
    "of matter fields provided they get supermassive near the gut scale .",
    "they can then be integrated out in froggatt - nielsen type diagrams@xcite which provide higher - order effective interaction contributions to the mass matrix elements .",
    "while so(10 ) relates quarks and leptons of one family , it is necessary to invoke some horizontal flavor symmetry in order to avoid the bad su(5 ) relations such as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "this can be done at four different levels of model building with the following prescriptions .",
    "level 1 : simply impose a certain texture , such as a modified fritzsch form for the mass matrices .",
    "level 2 : introduce an effective @xmath23 expansion for each mass matrix .",
    "the prefactors of the expansion parameters typically are not precisely determined , however .",
    "level 3 : assign effective operators for each matrix element , possibly with some flavor symmetry imposed .",
    "level 4 : introduce a horizontal flavor symmetry which assigns flavor charges to every higgs and matter superfield .",
    "higgs and yukawa superpotentials are constructed in terms of renormalizable ( and possibly some non - renormalizable ) terms which obey that flavor symmetry .",
    "matrix elements then follow from the froggatt - nielsen diagrams which can be constructed .",
    "the so(10 ) models found in the literature differ by their choice of higgs structure , horizontal flavor symmetry and the flavor charge assignments , if any .",
    "the desirable georgi - jarlskog relations,@xcite @xmath24 , can be readily obtained if a @xmath25 higgs vev points in the @xmath11 direction , or if a @xmath26 vev is involved .",
    "the presence of a @xmath27 vev and a flavor symmetry will typically lead to lopsided@xcite down quark and charged lepton mass matrices , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this is useful to explain the small @xmath30 and large @xmath31 mixing matrix elements.@xcite a consequence of this lopsided nature is an enhanced flavor - violating @xmath32 decay rate that is within one or two orders of magnitude of the present experimental limit .",
    "hence future improved experiments will be able to confirm or rule out this mechanism .",
    "most early models were easily able to accommodate the sma solar neutrino solution , while some could accommodate the low or qvo solution as well .",
    "however , to obtain the lma solution in the so(10 ) gut model framework with the seesaw mechanism , some fine tuning is generally required .",
    "typically , models which require special features of the dirac and right - handed majorana mass matrices , @xmath33 and @xmath34 , to get maximal atmospheric mixing have trouble getting the lma solar solution . that is easier to achieve",
    "if the @xmath34 matrix can be independently adjusted to yield the lma solution , while @xmath33 and @xmath29 conspire to give maximal atmospheric mixing .",
    "a number of so(10 ) susy gut models can be found in the literature.@xcite to illustrate the success of some well - known models , i have confined my attention to four - dimensional models with three quark and lepton families for which the seesaw mechanism applies with three right - handed ( conjugate left - handed ) singlet neutrino fields .",
    "i have also assumed that the presently - preferred lma solution@xcite will be confirmed by kamland.@xcite on this basis already some of the models , as constructed , have been ruled out by more recent mass and mixing data , while others still survive . it is instructive , however , to compare the various features of all the models considered .",
    "table 1 lists the models with their level of construction , flavor symmetry , texture , applicable range of @xmath35 , whether or not they fit the ckm mixing matrix and their preferred solar neutrino solution .",
    "some textures correspond to lopsided mass matrices , while others have only symmetric or both symmetric and antisymmetric entries .",
    "the latter favor large values of @xmath35 to give the desired yukawa coupling unification at the gut scale , while the lopsided models tend to require low or moderate values of @xmath35 in order that the matrices be lopsided enough .",
    "thus the determination of @xmath35 , as well as the observation of the @xmath32 mentioned earlier , will serve to rule out one choice or the other .",
    "some features of the models warrant specific remarks . in the blazek - raby - tobe model,@xcite",
    "a sterile neutrino is present while the apex of the ckm triangle is in the second quadrant which is now at odds with the recent quark mixing determination .",
    "the chou - wu model@xcite requires a sterile neutrino to get the solar lma solution .",
    "the chen - mahanthappa model@xcite prefers the low solar solution , for the lma solution can not be obtained without violating the upper chooz bound@xcite on @xmath36 .",
    "the maekawa model@xcite also violates the chooz bound on @xmath36 . for the buchmuller - wyler model@xcite and the kitano - mimura model@xcite ,",
    "it is not clear from their solutions whether the lma mixing is in the presently allowed range . of the three remaining apparently successful models ,",
    "the babu - pati - wilczek model@xcite requires a non - seesaw contribution to the left - handed majorana matrix , @xmath37 , in order to fit both the atmospheric and solar lma solutions .",
    "the ross - velasco - sevilla model@xcite is rather recent and has not been completely specified . to illustrate some of the features of so(10 ) models cited earlier ,",
    "some detailed features of the very predictive albright - barr model@xcite are presented in the next section .",
    "of the models listed in table 1 , some are already essentially ruled out by the more accurate recent quark and lepton mixing data , but as we have seen , several are still viable . in making this judgment",
    "i have assumed there are no light sterile neutrinos and that the lma solution is the correct one .",
    "of course , some models which are on the verge of being ruled out may be revived by their authors with further adjustments .",
    "the model developed in ref .",
    "10 is based on a @xmath38 flavor symmetry that stabilizes the dimopoulos - wilczek solution to the doublet - triplet splitting problem by the introduction of a second pair of @xmath39 higgs fields.@xcite the higgs and yukawa superpotentials can be written down after flavor charges for that symmetry are assigned to all the higgs and matter fields .",
    "the mass matrices then follow from froggatt - nielsen diagrams involving the vertex terms appearing in the superpotentials .",
    "the dirac mass matrices for the up and down quarks , neutrinos and charged leptons are found to be    @xmath40 \\end{array}$$ \\label{matrices}\\ ] ]    several texture zeros appear in elements for which the flavor symmetry forbids the appearance of any froggatt - nielsen diagrams .",
    "the antisymmetric @xmath41 terms arise from diagrams involving the adjoint @xmath25 higgs vev pointing in the @xmath11 direction .",
    "the lopsided nature of the large @xmath42 terms in @xmath28 and @xmath29 arises from the appearances of diagrams involving the @xmath43 higgs vev as suggested earlier .",
    "the eight input parameters are defined at the gut scale and are set equal to    @xmath44    with these values , the structures of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 matrices lead to the georgi - jarlskog relations at the gut scale with yukawa coupling unification for @xmath45 .",
    "all nine quark and charged lepton masses plus the three ckm angles and cp phase are well - fitted with these input parameters after evolution from the gut scale :    @xmath46             m_u(1\\ { \\rm gev } ) & = 4.5\\ { \\rm mev},\\quad & m_\\mu & = 105.7\\                   { \\rm mev}\\\\[0.1 in ]             v_{us } & = 0.220 , \\quad & m_e & = 0.511\\ { \\rm mev}\\\\[0.1 in ]             v_{cb } & = 0.0395 , \\quad & \\delta_{cp } & = 64^\\circ\\\\            \\end{array}$$ \\label{inputvalues}\\ ] ]    determine the input parameters which lead to the following predictions :    @xmath47             m_s(1\\ { \\rm gev } ) & = 148\\ { \\rm mev},\\quad & m_d(1\\ { \\rm mev } )                   & = 7.9\\ { \\rm mev}\\\\[0.1 in ]             |v_{ub}/v_{cb}| & = 0.080,\\quad & \\sin 2\\beta & = 0.64.\\\\            \\end{array}$$ \\label{predictions}\\ ] ]    the hermitian matrices @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are diagonalized by small lh rotations , while @xmath50 is diagonalized by a large lh rotation .",
    "this accounts for the fact that @xmath51 is small , while @xmath52 is large and responsible for the maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing for any reasonable @xmath34 .",
    "the type of @xmath53 solar neutrino mixing is determined by the texture of @xmath34 , since the solar and atmospheric mixings are essentially decoupled in this model .",
    "further study reveals the lma solution requires a nearly hierarchical texture@xcite which can also be understood with froggatt - nielsen diagrams .",
    "the texture suggested is    @xmath54    with the parameters @xmath41 and @xmath55 specified in eq .",

    "@xmath56 then sets the scale of the heavy right - handed majorana neutrino masses and determines @xmath57 for the atmospheric neutrino mixing by the seesaw mechanism .        the allowed parameter space in the @xmath58 plane@xcite shown in fig .",
    "1 corresponds to the pre - sno allowed lma solar neutrino region@xcite in the @xmath59 mixing plane . with the recent sno and super - kamiokande results,@xcite",
    "it should be understood that part of the allowed parameter region corresponding to higher values of @xmath60 , i.e. , lower values of @xmath61 , has been eliminated . in fig .",
    "1(a ) contours of constant @xmath61 and @xmath62 are shown , while contours of constant @xmath61 and @xmath63 are given in fig .",

    "for example , a value of @xmath72 results in @xmath73 , while the mixing angles remain unchanged .",
    "whereas one might have expected an inverted hierarchy with @xmath74 and @xmath75 so close together and much smaller than @xmath76 , the resultant form of @xmath70 leads to a normal but rather mild hierarchy for the light left - handed neutrino masses .",
    "several critical tests will be made in the future with long baseline experiments involving superbeams , and possibly neutrino factories .",
    "these tests involve the nature of the light neutrino mass hierarchy , i.e. , normal vs. inverted ; the value of the reactor neutrino mixing angle @xmath65 or the element @xmath77 ; and the determination of the leptonic dirac cp - violating phase @xmath78 . for the three models considered which clearly appear to be still viable ,",
    "the predictions are listed in table 2 .",
    "it is apparent that the presently successful so(10 ) gut models favor a normal hierarchy .",
    "this is in stark contrast with the models with a conserved lepton number quantity,@xcite such as @xmath79 , which favor an inverted hierarchy . on the other hand ,",
    "the predicted value for @xmath80 is apparently quite model dependent , with some models predicting values very close to the chooz bound , while others require a neutrino factory to pin down the correct value .",
    "unfortunately , the leptonic cp violating phase @xmath78 , which is of great interest if the lma solution is the correct one , is not well determined in most models .",
    "a number of @xmath81 susy gut models have been proposed in the literature with a small but interesting sample considered here .",
    "some have been , or are on the verge of being , eliminated , while others still survive and are able to explain all the known quark and lepton mass and mixing data .",
    "long baseline experiments which can determine whether the neutrino mass hierarchy is normal or inverted appear to have a direct bearing on the survival of so(10 ) vs. nearly - conserved @xmath82 type models .",
    "this particular test appears to be one of the most promising for narrowing down the list of successful model candidates .",
    "the observed value of @xmath63 appears to be less discriminatory between models of the so(10 ) or the conserved lepton type .",
    "some models of both types predict that @xmath65 lies just below the chooz bound and will be observable with off - axis beams and/or superbeams .",
    "others favor such low values of @xmath65 that a neutrino factory will be required to determine its value .",
    "the issue of proton decay via dim-5 operators is potentially a serious one for gut models , if proton decay is not detected shortly.@xcite on the other hand , by formulating an so(10 ) model in five dimensions , one can eliminate the dim-5 operator contributions entirely.@xcite the dim-6 operators will still be present and possibly somewhat enhanced , but they typically lead to lifetimes for proton decay which are presently two to three orders of magnitude larger than the present lower bounds .",
