    "it has recently been suggested that several observational results may be hinting at a significant non - gaussian component in the primordial density fluctuation field ( mathis , diego , & silk 2004 , hereafter mds ) . among these are the detection of structures with high velocity dispersions at redshifts @xmath1 ( miley et al .",

    "it is argued by mds that while it is hard ( although possible ) to reconcile the observational results with predictions made on the basis of a gaussian field , these arise more naturally with either positively - or negatively - skewed density fields .    in this paper",

    "we allow a variance of @xmath51 in its value , as to possibly address non - gravitational effects which may result in a deviation from the simplistic assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , and also to reflect the observed variance in this parameter .",
    "an additional uncertainty relating to this scaling is represented in the parameter @xmath52 , which describes the temporal evolution of cluster temperatures , and is taken to be either zero or unity , constituting two limiting cases for which there is either no evolution , or strong evolution , respectively .",
    "little is known on the evolution of the x - ray temperature function due to the lack of x - ray observations of high - redshift clusters , although some interesting insight is gained from hydrodynamical simulations ( norman 2005 ) .",

    "the results for the s - z power spectrum and number counts described below refer to these two models : ( a ) ic gas temperature evolves with time according to @xmath73 , and ( b ) no temperature evolution , @xmath74 .",
    "power spectra were calculated at @xmath75 ghz , with a beam size is @xmath76 .",
    "number counts were calculated also at @xmath77 ghz and @xmath78 ghz .",
    "several qualitative assessments can be pointed out before we describe specific results .",
    "the longer tail of the non - gaussian distribution function ( with respect to that of the gaussian ) at the high mass end translates to higher cluster abundance in general , and high mass clusters in particular .",
    "this holds in the entire redshift range ( with the exception of @xmath79 , since the mass function in the non - gaussian case was normalized such as to yield the same cluster abundance as in the gaussian case ) .",
    "this tendency stems from the fact that a positively - skewed density fluctuation field exhibits earlier cluster formation by enhancing the probability that the average density within a spherical region of any size exceeds the critical density for collapse .",
    "consequently , the s - z power spectrum is expected to attain higher levels in the non - gaussian case .",
    "owing to the inferred denser population of clusters at high redshifts , the magnitude at the peak should shift to higher multipoles , reflecting the higher density of distant clusters with smaller angular sizes .",
    "naturally , this effect would be drastically reduced in a non - evolving temperature scenario due to the inferred lower temperatures associated with high redshift clusters when the ( @xmath80 ) scaling is factored out .    the s - z power spectrum calculated for cases ( a ) and ( b ) is plotted in figs .

    "finally , the impact of introducing a variance of @xmath58 in the cluster core scaling on the magnitude of the s - z power spectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clrc ] .    referring first to the magnitude of the total power spectrum in fig .",
    "[ fig : clz ] , corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath84 , in both cases ( a ) and model ( b ) higher levels of power are clearly evident in the non - gaussian model .",
    "quantitatively , the maximum power levels attained in case ( a ) are @xmath85 and @xmath86 for the gaussian and non - gaussian models , respectively .",
    "note that both peak at multipoles higher than @xmath87 ; in the gaussian model this is due to the high gas densities of distant clusters implied by the constancy of the gas fraction , whereas in the non - gaussian model the combination of high gas densities and the long tail at the high - mass cluster end is responsible for this result .",
    "compared to case ( a ) , distant clusters are cooler in case ( b ) by virtue of the redshift independence of their temperatures , resulting in lower power levels ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) in the gaussian and @xmath90 models , respectively . in the gaussian model the power peaks at @xmath91 , reflecting the lower contribution from cooler , more distant clusters . in the non - gaussian model ,",
    "a relatively high abundance of massive clusters at high redshifts ( i.e , small angular scales ) leads to sustained high power levels on these scales .",
    "it is also worth recalling that regardless of whether or not the temperature changes with redshift , it still increases with increasing mass , so even when @xmath74 a denser population of hot clusters is produced in the long tail of the @xmath90 pdf .",
    "the contribution of clusters lying at relatively high redshifts to the overall power is clearly seen in the @xmath90 model .",
    "in fact , in case ( a ) the contribution of clusters lying in the redshift range @xmath92 peaks at @xmath93 . however , the total power continues to rise owing to the non - negligible power generated by clusters situated at @xmath94 , particularly so from redshift range @xmath95 .",
    "in fact , at @xmath96 this contribution is surpassed by the next redshift range , @xmath97 . in the gaussian model",
    "the contribution from this range to the overall power is decidedly negligible . the same effect , although less pronounced , is evident in case ( b ) ;",
    "here distant clusters are cooler [ than in the corresponding case ( a ) ] by virtue of the @xmath74 scaling .",

    "[ fig : clz ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : clm ] illustrates the distribution of s - z power in four mass ranges .",
    "most striking is the relative contribution to power from clusters lying in the @xmath99 mass range . whereas it is practically negligible at all multipoles in the gaussian model , this is not the case in the non - gaussian model",
    "; in fact , these massive clusters dominate the total power up to @xmath100 and @xmath101 in cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . at higher multipoles the @xmath102 range dominates . in the gaussian model low - mass clusters of @xmath103",
    "prevail only at the highest multipoles .",
    "these clusters are obviously the most abundant objects predicted by a mass function based on a primordial density fluctuation field of gaussian nature , and - in light of their relative small sizes ( and low temperatures ) - thus must lie at a relative proximity to the observer ; more distant clusters of similar masses would not produce sufficiently strong s - z signal to be detected .",
    "otherwise , in the gaussian case , the lion s share of power originates in clusters in the mass range @xmath102 .",
    "[ fig : clz ] and  [ fig : clm ] explicitly demonstrate the significantly higher contribution of high - redshift - and therefore hotter , in particular in case ( a ) - clusters in the @xmath104 model .",
    "this is manifested in higher power magnitude and at an intensification at higher multipoles corresponding to distant , low angular - size clusters . to further contrast the predictions of the two models , the ratio of total level of the s - z power in the @xmath104 model to that in the gaussian model for cases ( a ) and ( b )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : clcomp ] . for @xmath105 ,",

    "these changes affect the power spectrum for the gaussian and non - gaussian models in slightly different ways ; we have already seen that in the gaussian model the largest contribution to the power spectrum comes from clusters with masses @xmath102 .",
    "that is , an outcome of increasing @xmath49 is that most of the contributing clusters undergo cooling , and the level of power decreases .",
    "obviously , lowering @xmath49 has the opposite effect .",
    "this is clearly seen in the upper- and lower - left panels of fig  [ fig : clxi ] .",
    "it can also be seen ( particularly so in the lower - left panel ) that the curves peak at decreasing multipoles with increasing @xmath49 . this has to do with the fact that the contribution of these relatively low - mass clusters to the overall power levels decreases with increasing @xmath49 , so that power is suppressed from high multipoles , resulting in a leftward shift of the peaks . in the @xmath104 model",
    "the results are somewhat different . here",
    "the contribution to the power from high - mass clusters ( @xmath99 ) dominates at @xmath113 ( case a ) and @xmath114 ( case b ) , whereas the corresponding contribution at higher multipoles originates in clusters lying within the mass range @xmath102 . in other words , an increment of power with increasing @xmath49",
    "is expected at lower multipoles , and a decrease of power with increasing @xmath49 at higher multipoles .",
    "this is shown in the upper- and lower - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : clxi ] .",
    "we also investigate the influence of @xmath43 on the power spectrum levels .",
    "the results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : clrc ] , and are rather obvious .",
    "first , lowering or increasing the core radius changes the effective cluster size , and consequently , the multipole at which the power peaks .",
    "this can be easily seen in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clrc ] . in the remaining panels",
    "it is somewhat harder to notice the effect , owing to the fact that the peaks fall beyond @xmath115 . also , in order to keep the total gas mass constant , lower and higher core sizes necessitate higher and lower central gas densities , respectively .",
    "this results in higher and lower power levels for lower and higher core - sized clusters , respectively , as is apparent from the fact that the power spectrum scales as the central gas density squared ( equations  [ eq : clmb ] and  [ eq : ythet ] ) .",
    "it is useful to mention some recent studies of s - z power spectrum calculations and compare with our results .",
    "case ( a ) of the gaussian model is the most adequate for comparison , since past work has focused on gaussian density fields , and whether analytically or inferred from hydrodynamical simulations , the ic gas temperature has been assumed ( or observed ) to increase with redshift ( at least to a certain degree ) , in contrast with the constant temperature scenario , case ( b ) . da silva et al .",
    "( 2001 ) employed hydrodynamical simulations to find power levels of @xmath116 peaking at @xmath117 , depending on whether or not non - adiabatic processes such as preheating and radiative cooling were included .",
    "their selection of cosmological parameters is essentially identical to ours , but the calculations were carried out in the rayleigh - jeans region , so a comparison between their results and ours requires an introduction of a multiplicative factor of 4 to our power levels .",
    "consequently , the magnitude of the total power for case ( a ) in the gaussian model peaks at multipole @xmath118 , at a value of @xmath119 .",
    "bond et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have quantified the s - z power spectrum using both analytic calculations and results of hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "the simulations yield peak power levels of @xmath120 at @xmath118 .",
    "their analytic calculation yields similar power levels , but at lower peak multipoles , @xmath121 .",
    "note that they calculated s - z power at the _ cbi _ frequency , @xmath122 .",
    "rescaling our results to this frequency gives a power level of @xmath123 .",
    "refregier & teyssier ( 2002 ) have also used hydrodynamical simulations and an analytic approach to calculate the s - z power spectrum .",
    "they found that both methods yield approximately the same power levels ( peaking at @xmath96 with magnitude @xmath124 ) , particularly so when a cluster mass range @xmath125 is employed in the analytical calculation .",
    "the calculations were carried out in the r - j region .",
    "springel , white & hernquist ( 2001 ) employed hydrodynamical simulations , neglecting non - adiabatic processes , to infer power levels of @xmath126 at the peak , @xmath118 .",
    "in fact , the latter paper presents a detailed comparison of s - z power spectra published in the literature showing a large scatter ( spanning over an order of magnitude ) , which can largely be attributed to uncertainties in the theoretical modeling of ic gas and the techniques implemented in hydrodynamical calculations . to complete this section ,",
    "we combine , in a single plot , the total power spectrum levels of the s - z effect in the gaussian and @xmath104 models , cases ( a ) and ( b ) , with results from the _ cbi _ and _ acbar _ experiments .",
    "the analytic results were rescaled so as to correspond to an observation frequency of 31 ghz , corresponding to the _ cbi _ instrument . as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : cbiacb ] ) , it seems difficult to reconcile the gaussian results with the data , whereas case ( a ) in the @xmath104 model provides a reasonable match to the observed power excess at @xmath127 .",
    "these results agree with those found by mathis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the qualitative considerations pertaining to the power spectrum that were presented in the previous section apply also to s - z number counts : higher ( cumulative ) counts are expected in the non - gaussian case , and those are likely to be distributed differently in redshift space with respect to the gaussian case , reflecting the higher population of massive clusters at high redshifts , which satisfy the detection flux limit .",
    "[ fig : nctz ] depicts the redshift distribution of cumulative s - z number counts .",
    "the arrangement of plots according to model is the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : clz ] through  ( [ fig : clrc ] ) . in none of the models clusters with masses",
    "lower than @xmath128 generate fluxes that exceed the adopted detection limit , @xmath72 .",
    "the most noticeable results displayed in the figure are : in the gaussian model the largest contribution to the cumulative number counts ( at @xmath79 ) comes from clusters lying in the mass range @xmath102 . actually , the cumulative number counts at @xmath79 in this mass range are higher by at least an order of magnitude than those contributed by clusters in the mass range @xmath99 .",
    "specifically , in case ( a ) the curves depicting the total counts and those contributed by clusters with masses in the range @xmath102 are virtually identical . in case ( b ) , however , at redshifts @xmath129 counts are dominated by clusters with higher masses , @xmath99 .",
    "this can be attributed to the fact that in case ( b ) the clusters in the former mass range have lower s - z fluxes due to the lower temperatures as compared to clusters in case ( a ) .",
    "clusters belonging to the latter mass range are still massive enough ( and consequently , hot enough ) to compensate for the lack of temperature evolution .",
    "regardless of this effect , it should be emphasized that the counts in the high mass range are negligible in comparison with the total cumulative counts at @xmath79 .",
    "a slightly different behaviour is apparent in case ( a ) of the @xmath81 model ; here total counts are still dominated by clusters in the mass range @xmath102 , although differences are not as pronounced as in the gaussian case . while counts in the lower - mass range in the gaussian case are higher by a factor of @xmath130 than the corresponding counts in the higher - mass range , here a mere factor of @xmath131 is seen . in case",
    "( b ) the results are even more interesting , since the total counts are dominated by high - mass clusters , lying at @xmath132 .",
    "the cumulative counts at the lowest redshifts consist of a slightly higher contribution from the high - mass range and are larger by a factor @xmath133 than the corresponding contribution from mass range @xmath102 .",

    "respectively , so our results for @xmath138 ghz can be easily scaled accordingly . adopting the same value of the limiting flux ( @xmath141 ) ,",
    "we find that values of the ratios of number counts at @xmath138 ghz and @xmath78 ghz are larger in the gaussian than in the @xmath104 model .",
    "this can clearly be attributed to the significantly higher population of clusters with flux exceeding the limit in the @xmath104 model .",
    "note that an accurate calculation of the s - z intensity change necessitates a relativistic calculation ( rephaeli 1995 ) which yields a more complicated expression for the _ temperature - dependent _ spectral function ( for which there are a few analytic approximations ; see , e.g. , shimon & rephaeli 2004 , itoh & nozawa 2004 ) .",
    "the deviation from the calculation can amount to few tens of percent for typical temperatures in the range 5 - 10 kev .",
    "since our main focus here is a comparison between predictions of the two density fields for quantities that are integrated over the cluster population ( rather than an accurate description of the effect in a given cluster ) , it suffices to use the much simpler function @xmath139 .",
    "we may summarize the results of this subsection as follows : total count levels are significantly higher in the @xmath104 model , roughly by factors of @xmath142 and @xmath131 in cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . the contribution of high - mass clusters to the total cumulative counts are practically negligible in the gaussian case , but important in the non - gaussian model , particularly so in case ( b ) where the lower - mass clusters fail to generate sufficient s - z flux by virtue of their lower temperatures with respect to the evolving temperature scenario in case ( a ) .",
    "in addition to this , the counts are more broadly distributed in redshift space in the non - gaussian model due to the higher abundance of clusters at high redshifts .    as in the section describing the s - z power spectrum , a comparison with published works on s - z number counts is pertinent .",

    ", this is most noticeable at high redshifts where the predictions of the mass function for the massive clusters in the @xmath18 and @xmath19 cases vary greatly .",
    "since these distant clusters have small angular sizes , it is not surprising that the ratio between the two curves increases with increasing multipole , reflecting the relative higher abundance of clusters with small apparent sizes for @xmath18 .",
    "this is further established by noting that the number counts ratio for @xmath18 and @xmath19 are highest at high redshifts : while the ratios are @xmath158 and @xmath159 at @xmath160 and @xmath161 , respectively , the cumulative counts for @xmath18 at @xmath162 are approximately @xmath163 times as high as those obtained for @xmath19",
    ". clearly , very massive clusters at high redshifts are more common in the model with @xmath18 than in that with @xmath19 .",
    "the angular 2-point correlation function ( hereafter a2pcf ) is expected to be steeply dependent on the mass function , even more strongly than the angular power spectrum and cluster number counts , due to the _ quadratic _ dependence on the cluster abundance .",
    "the a2pcf of s - z clusters has been studied by diaferio et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who explored the dependence of the expected number of cluster pairs on the biasing relation between the cluster and the mass distribution , and mei & bartlett ( 2003 ) , who studied the feasibility of alleviating the degeneracy between @xmath164 and @xmath154 by means of combining s - z cluster counts with their angular correlation function .",
    "the requisite data will become available when targeted s - z cluster surveys are carried out . as pointed out by mei & bartlett ,",
    "the scientific yield from the a2pcf lies in the fact that s - z cluster catalogs , on their own , may constitute an important probe of cosmological models and cluster properties , even without the detailed follow - up observations of individual clusters . here",
    "we calculate the a2pcf of s - z clusters for the gaussian and @xmath104 mass functions and assess its diagnostic use to distinguish between the two models .",

    "this can be done either by employing the observational correlation function of clusters ( e.g. bahcall & soneira 1983 ) , or by regarding it as the biased counterpart of the correlation function of dark matter , @xmath174 .",
    "we choose to employ the second method , in which the cluster correlation function is commonly written as @xmath175 where @xmath176 is the linear bias factor . making use of the global isotropy of the universe , we can express the correlation function as the fourier - transformed power spectrum of dark matter : @xmath177 the simplest form for the bias factor is ( matarrese et al .",
    "1997 , catelan et al .",
    "1998 ) @xmath178 note that more accurate formulae for the bias factor exist , which take into account non - spherical collapse ( sheth , mo & tormen 2001 ) and nonlinear clustering effects ( peacock & dodds 1996 ) ; we will limit ourselves here to the simplest case , since our main objective is this study is a comparative evaluation of the predictions of two mass functions ( rather than their respective accuracy ) .    to proceed , it is necessary to write down the physical distance @xmath7 between the members of a cluster pair , separated by an angle @xmath35 . in doing",
    "so it is very convenient to take advantage of the fact that the observational spatial correlation function falls off rapidly with distance , @xmath179 ( e.g. bahcall & soneira 1983 ) ; a corresponding trend can be inferred from equation  ( [ eq : xim ] ) , although in this case it is obviously different from a power law .",

    "expression  ( [ eq : acor ] ) then finally becomes @xmath194\\,dk .",
    "\\label{eq : dmappw}\\ ] ] this integral can be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "the a2pcfs in cases ( a ) and ( b ) in the gaussian and @xmath104 models are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : szc ] .",
    "their shapes are dictated by the functional form of the spatial correlation function , which is dominated by the bessel function of the first kind and order zero appearing in equation  ( [ eq : dmappw ] ) . referring first to the differences between the predictions of cases ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", it can be seen that in both the gaussian and @xmath104 models the correlation levels are higher in case ( b ) .",
    "the reason for this is easily explainable noting that case ( b ) is biased towards higher - mass clusters owing to its lack of temperature evolution ; as clusters do not become hotter with increasing redshift as in case ( a ) , only very massive clusters generate detectable s - z signals .",
    "these higher - mass clusters are more strongly correlated , as indicated by the the bias term , equation  ( [ eq : bmz ] ) , by virtue of its specific dependence on the mass variance @xmath195 , a monotonically decreasing function of mass @xmath196 .",
    "thus , the bias factor is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath196 , giving rise to stronger correlations among high - mass cluster populations .    in order to explain the differences between the predictions of the @xmath104 and gaussian models in either case ( a ) or ( b )",
    ", it will first be useful to give a qualitative explanation of the shape of the a2pcf curve .",
    "we may think of an effective maximum physical separation for which ( positive ) correlation between two clusters is still possible .",
    "at low angular separations the scale corresponding to this limiting distance can be subtended at relatively high redshifts , so contribution to the a2pcf at this angle is possible from low as well as high redshifts .",
    "with increasing angular separation the corresponding scale can only be subtended at lower redshifts , so that the main contribution to the correlation is generated locally .",
    "since the @xmath104 model yields higher cluster populations ( and particularly so of high - mass clusters ) at high redshifts , it is natural to expect higher correlation levels than in the corresponding gaussian case , where the cluster population is limited to lower redshifts , and also relatively limited in massive clusters . as can be seen in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : szc ] at angular separations of @xmath197 and @xmath198 in cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively , the correlation levels in the @xmath104 model fall below those of the gaussian model . since the redshift range available for contributing to the angular correlation function reduces with increasing angular separation , this trend is indicative of a diminished contribution of relatively low - redshift clusters in the @xmath104 model .",
    "in fact , this is indeed the case , and can be easily realized by inspection of the upper and lower - right hand panels of figs .",
    "[ fig : clz ] and  ( [ fig : nctz ] ) , where it has been shown that a substantial contribution to the power spectrum levels at high multipoles and to the cumulative number counts originates in clusters lying at high redshifts ( @xmath94 ) . as explained above , at such high redshifts clusters",
    "are not strongly correlated at high angular separations by virtue of their mutual large physical distances . on the other hand , in the gaussian model",
    "the corresponding contribution comes almost exclusively from low - redshift clusters , which may manifest relatively strong correlations even at higher angular separations . clearly",
    ", this effect is also responsible for the steeper shape of the a2pcf curve in the non - gaussian models .",
    "the main objective of this study has been to compare predictions of s - z observables for two mass functions which differ mainly at the high mass end .",
    "a @xmath104 distributed density fluctuation field is characterized by a longer tail of high density fluctuations with respect to the gaussian case , and is capable of generating more high - mass clusters at higher redshifts , owing to the denser population of high density fluctuations ( or peaks ) which can collapse at earlier times .",
    "s - z power spectrum , number counts , and 2-point angular correlation function all prove to yield significantly different results if calculated using a mass function derived from a gaussian or @xmath104 primordial density field .",
    "we have demonstrated that levels of the power spectrum in the latter model are higher by about an order of magnitude than in the former model , depending on the ic temperature scaling with the cluster mass .",
    "this was explicitly shown to take effect in light of the larger contribution of high - mass clusters and high redshift clusters to the total power in the non - gaussian model .",
    "the larger contribution from distant clusters is also responsible for the higher multipoles at peak power .",
    "we have shown that s - z power spectrum levels are contributed by different cluster populations in the gaussian and @xmath104 models ; in the former model , most of the power originates in clusters lying at @xmath92 , with the exception of the higher multipoles for which a non - negligible amount of power comes from @xmath95 .",
    "in contrast , in the latter model more power is contributed from higher redshift clusters , beginning at multipole @xmath135 . on the other hand ,",
    "most of the power is contributed by clusters lying in the mass range @xmath199 @xmath200 .",
    "this holds for both models in the interesting multipole ranges .",
    "the power spectrum is quite sensitive also to cluster internal properties , as is demonstrated in part through the modification of the cluster temperature scaling with mass , and by the dependence on the cluster core radius .",
    "these reflect the uncertainty of the actual scalings due to observational scatter , lack of high - redshift cluster data , and insufficient theoretical information .",
    "plausible scatter of @xmath201 in these scalings results in significant differences in levels of power , albeit to a considerably lower degree than those produced by replacing the gaussian mass function with the @xmath104 mass function .",
    "number counts are also significantly higher in the @xmath104 model ( up to an order of magnitude ) , reflecting the higher population of high - redshift , massive clusters , capable of generating sufficient s - z flux to be detected by upcoming experiments .",
    "these results obviously depend on the flux detection limit of the experiment , and are likely to become more pronounced with increasing limiting flux , owing to the high - mass cluster bias .",
    "the 2-point angular correlation function of s - z clusters is potentially an additional observable for which the gaussian and @xmath104 models may result in substantially different predictions .",
    "depending on the temperature scaling with redshift , it has been shown that the correlation level at the lowest angular separations ( @xmath202 ) is higher by a factor @xmath203 and @xmath108 in the @xmath104 model .",
    "on the other hand , at larger angular separations correlation levels are higher in the gaussian model .",
    "this characteristic behaviour leads to a steeper functional form in the @xmath104 model .",
    "although not explicitly demonstrated in this study , the flux limit of the experiment is , of course , a major factor in determining the correlation levels , due to the fact that higher flux limits are biased towards more massive clusters , whose bias parameters are larger .    an additional relevant property which may be manifested differently in gaussian and non - gaussian density fields is cluster ( or halo ) formation time .",
    "clusters are likely to form earlier in ( positively skewed ) non - gaussian fields owing to the higher probability of finding an overdensity exceeding the critical density for collapse with respect to the corresponding probability in a gaussian density field .",
    "this may bear consequences for , e.g. , the concentration parameter of haloes , a key parameter of the nfw dark matter profile ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ) . the concentration parameter is expected to assume higher values with earlier formation time by virtue of the higher background density . in this context the recent result from a lensing analysis of the cluster a1689 ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2005 ) is of particular interest .",
    "a very steep mass profile was deduced in this analysis , one that is fit by an extremely high concentration parameter of @xmath204 .",
    "this value seems to be at a considerable variance with theoretical predictions .",
    "observations of two other clusters yield @xmath205 for ms 2137 - 23 ( gavazzi et al .",
    "2003 ) , and @xmath206 and @xmath207 for the main and secondary clumps in the cluster c1 0024 ( kneib et al . 2003 ) .",
    "although perhaps not very meaningful from a statistical point of view , these results may be indicative of earlier formation times , which are favoured in positively - skewed non - gaussian fields .",
    "the temperature of the ic gas of virialized clusters may also be affected by the cluster formation time .",
    "in conventional temperature - mass relations it is the observed redshift of a cluster that determines its temperature . in this _ recent formation _ approach , the relevant redshift is the observation redshift .",
    "clearly , this picture does not address the merging process that gives rise to the clusters we observe today .",
    "in the merger picture the formation redshift , @xmath208 , may differ significantly from the cluster observed redshift , @xmath209 , and the predicted temperatures will vary accordingly .",
    "the temperature and concentration parameter dependence on formation time are likely to influence s - z observables ; higher ic gas temperatures ( stemming from earlier formation times ) may give rise to an intensification of the effect , whereas , if one assumes that ic gas approximately traces the dark matter distribution , higher concentration parameters may bring about transfer of power to higher multipoles , in light of the resulting steeper gas density profile .",
    "we have conducted a preliminary study of the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of formation times within the framework of gaussian and @xmath153 density fields . this initial work is based on the excursion set formalism and its derivatives ( bond et al .",
    "1991 , lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "we note that the definition of the formation time used here is somewhat arbitrary ; clusters were assumed to have formed once they assembled a fraction of either @xmath210 or @xmath211 of their current masses .",
    "we have found that on most relevant mass scales clusters form at higher redshifts in the @xmath153 model .",
    "defining `` effective '' cluster temperatures and concentration parameters by averaging these two quantities at specified formation redshifts over the pdf of formation times , we learn that temperatures and concentration parameters are on average higher in the @xmath153 model for masses @xmath212 @xmath200 . at higher masses",
    "the differences are practically negligible . also ,",
    "with increasing observation redshift , the differences become gradually less pronounced .",
    "this is related to the fact that the time range available for formation is reduced with increasing observation time , since the cluster must have formed at a redshift exceeding the observation redshift .",
    "as an example of our preliminary results we include fig .",
    "( [ fig : avtem ] ) , which compares the effective ic gas temperature ( as defined above ) in the @xmath153 and gaussian models as a function of cluster mass , for @xmath211 and @xmath210 . also shown",
    "are the respective temperature ratios between the @xmath213 predictions and those given by equation  ( [ eq : tempsc ] ) .",
    "clearly , the indicated average temperatures are closely related to the redshift range at which the formation time pdf attains the highest levels . for example",
    ", the pdfs of the lowest mass scale ( @xmath214 ) peak at relatively high redshifts , and therefore the weight of the contribution from the @xmath215 factor is rather large .",
    "this results in higher average temperatures .",
    "the effect is most pronounced when comparing the @xmath153 model with the non - averaged temperature of equation  ( [ eq : tempsc ] ) , since for the latter case all clusters are assumed to have formed at @xmath216 .",
    "obviously , @xmath210 implies earlier formation times and higher average temperatures for a given ( low ) cluster mass .",
    "this holds also for the @xmath153 model , which involves earlier formation times for this mass range .",
    "the average temperature predictions in the @xmath153 and gaussian models show that clusters of @xmath217 are hotter by factors @xmath218 and @xmath219 for @xmath210 and @xmath211 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath220 the corresponding factors are @xmath221 and @xmath222 , while for @xmath223 in both cases the factors are @xmath224 .",
    "we may therefore conclude as follows : a mass function based on a @xmath16 density fluctuation field gives rise to higher populations of massive clusters at relatively high redshifts with respect to a mass function derived on the basis of gaussian density fluctuation fields .",
    "this generates higher levels of s - z power spectrum and number counts by up to an order of magnitude .",
    "the 2-point angular correlation function of s - z clusters is also susceptible to the mass function model and predicts higher correlations at low angular separations in the non - gaussian model . at higher angular separations the correlation levels in a gaussian field",
    "cluster formation times are generally earlier in the non - gaussian model , and may also give rise to higher temperatures and concentration parameters of low - mass clusters observed at relatively low redshifts .",
