    "the ising model , first proposed by lenz in 1925 as a microscopical model for ferromagnetism , has a ( constant ) interaction @xmath0 included only between the nearest neighbors spins on a ( rigid ) lattice . despite its ( formal ) simplicity",
    "an analytical solution has been found only for one- , and two - dimensional models in zero magnetic field .",
    "@xcite for the three - dimensional ising model only approximate solutions are available ( e.g. series expansions , @xcite renormalization group calculations @xcite , @xmath1-expansions , @xcite monte carlo renormalization group calculations @xcite , and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations ) , @xcite although quite precise results have been found .",
    "it was clear , a few years after its introduction , that the ising model could be employed to describe other phase transitions . for instance , phase separation in binary alloys can be studied by an ising model in which upand downspins are replaced with sites occupied by a aor btype atom , respectively . the chemical potential plays the role of the magnetic field , the density that of the magnetization , etc . and",
    "the appropriate statistical ensemble is the semi - grand - canonical , instead of the canonical . with the above mentioned analogy in mind , in the present work we will use the languages of magnetism and of alloys interchangeably .    in a real magnetic crystal ,",
    "however , atoms interact with each other through a combination of elastic and magnetic forces .",
    "the next step in realism is , therefore , the explicit introduction of elastic degrees of freedom in the traditionally rigid system .",
    "the resulting model is termed _",
    "compressible ising _",
    "several empirical potentials have been proposed and employed to mimic the elastic force , from the simple lennard - jones to the more specific tersoff , @xcite keating , @xcite stillinger - weber , @xcite and others ( these last three have been introduced , mainly to reproduce the interaction between silicon and germanium atoms in the study of si@xmath2ge@xmath3 , viewed as ising binary alloy models ) .",
    "the issue of how the presence of elastic interactions affects the critical behavior of the ising model has been intensively studied . in 1954 , using thermodynamic considerations , rice @xcite predicted that if an ising system with divergent specific heat is put on a deformable lattice at constant pressure , it undergoes a first order transition .",
    "a number of calculations appeared later @xcite , all of which lead to the conclusion that a first order transition was expected to occur .",
    "all these studies assume that a pureising singularity happens at constant volume . in 1968",
    "fisher @xcite changed the situation drastically with his hidden variabletheory , assuming that the purephase transition occurs at fixed _ intensive _ variable , i.e. at fixed pressure . as a result of this hypothesis",
    "a second order transition was found with fisher renormalized exponents , if the critical exponent of the specific heat @xmath4 is positive .",
    "a significant highlight in this controversy was the work of larkin and pikin @xcite who , for the first time , considered a hamiltonian with fluctuations of both the order parameter and the elastic modes and pointed out the special role of the macroscopic mode * k=0 * ( in fourier space ) . as a result",
    "a first order transition is found at constant pressure and quadratic coupling of the order parameter and the strain tensor , also if @xmath5 .",
    "it was later recognized that this result is only valid at low pressure , whereas at high pressure the critical behavior seems to be much more complex .",
    "@xcite a different approach was used by baker and essam @xcite who mapped an ising model on a compressible lattice , including the coupling between magnetic and elastic degrees of freedom , onto a standard ising ( on a rigid lattice ) , but with parameters which depend on the elastic degrees of freedom . at constant volume",
    "the model exhibited identical critical behavior as the underlying rigid system , and not a first order transition as predicted .",
    "@xcite at constant pressure a second order transition was found with fisher renormalized exponents .",
    "this model , as well as others of the same type , however , considers a negligible shear modulus .",
    "this somewhat unphysical assumption was soon recognized to be the reason of the disappearance of the first order transition .",
    "further work @xcite with more elaborate schemes did not change the result : a first order transition was always predicted .",
    "finally , we cite the long and complicated work by bergman and halperin , @xcite in which a three - dimensional anisotropy in the elastic forces was introduced . in the isotropic case",
    "the same already established result was obtained , i.e. a first order transition at constant pressure if @xmath6 , and a second order transition with renormalized exponents at constant volume . however , this last condition is realized only if the atoms at the surface are fixed , otherwise the system has still enough degrees of freedom to develop a macroscopic instability . in the anisotropic case , however , a so - called microscopic instability was found at constant volume , and this is interpreted as a first order transition . in his habilitation thesis",
    "dnweg @xcite completely revised the topic .",
    "starting from the landau - ginzburg - wilson hamiltonian he was able to show that the cim under constant pressure exhibits mean - field critical behavior , @xcite in agreement with simulations .",
    "@xcite at constant volume he predicted two first order lines ending in critical points , which are likely to belong to the mean - field universality class . if the magnetic interactions are _ antiferromagnetic _ ( afm ) instead of ferromagnetic , @xcite a quadratic coupling between the order parameter and the elastic deformation should be expected . in this case",
    "the predictions are : ( i ) a second order phase transition with fisher - renormalized exponents in the case of constant volume @xcite ( this is in agreement with the @xmath1-expansion work of bergman and halperin @xcite ) ; ( ii ) a first order phase transition in the case of antiferromagnetic interactions and constant ( zero ) pressure . @xcite as pressure increases , the first order line in pressure - temperature space should split into two first order lines at a triple point .",
    "the theoretical prediction in the case of fm interactions at constant volume has been checked by tavazza _",
    "@xcite by mc simulations . in disagreement with theory",
    ", they found a closed first order line which separates ordered and disordered phases .",
    "this result raises the intriguing question of whether or not theory will be correct for the case of afm interactions and constant volume",
    ". this will be the topic of the study that we report here .",
    "we use the same model as considered previous in ref . .",
    "we consider a binary alloy of a and b atoms on the nodes of a distortable diamond lattice , free to move on the condition that the diamond four - fold coordination is preserved , and that the atomic species on each node may change .",
    "the coordination requirement speeds up considerably the simulations as the list of the nearest neighbors of a given atom , which enter the hamiltonian ( see below ) , is known from the very beginning and does not change during the simulations .",
    "the diamond `` lattice '' is decomposed into eight interpenetrating simple cubic sublattices of linear size @xmath7 , so there are @xmath8 atoms ( sites ) .",
    "each atom in the system has four degrees of freedom : the three spatial coordinate * r * and its species s , which is defined to be @xmath9 if the atom is an a , or @xmath10 if it is a b type .",
    "the total number of atoms @xmath11 is kept constant during the simulation , while the relative concentrations of a and b particles can vary and are controlled by the chemical potential .",
    "the corresponding appropriate statistical ensemble is termed semi - grand canonical .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 are the chemical potentials of a and b , respectively , and @xmath15 is the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential given by @xmath16 the sw potential contains a two body interaction @xmath17 involving nearest neighbors and a three body @xmath18 interaction that includes next - nearest neighbors as well . this last term is essential to stabilizing a diamond - like structure .",

    "silicon and germanium ( si = a , ge = b ) it has been estimated @xmath25=2.17 ev , @xmath1(-1,-1 ) = 1.93 ev , and @xmath26 = 2.0427 ev , @xcite and these values were used for of an elastic ferromagnet simulations .",
    "@xcite in the present work we increased the value for the a - b binding energy by 0.3 ev to favor alternate ordering of a - b particles analogous to the antiferromagnetic ordering in magnets , specifically @xmath27",
    ". the behavior for this value is expected to be typical of that in the af regime , but a much larger value could conceivably produce unanticipated effects .",
    "a systematic study of the dependence upon the value of @xmath26 is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the three body part of the hamiltonian is given by @xmath28 ( \\cos \\theta_{ijk}+\\frac{1}{3})^2\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is a function of the same kind of @xmath24 , @xmath30 is a simple function of the atomic species ( see ref . for details ) , and @xmath31 .",
    "the sum is performed over all triplets ( i , j , k ) with the vertex at site @xmath23 , @xmath22 and @xmath32 are nearest neighbors of @xmath23 .",
    "note that @xmath18 contains an angular term which is a sort of angular stiffness which is essential to stabilizing the diamond lattice ( in fact , assigning the bonds length alone is not sufficient , because the lattice has 3@xmath11 translational degrees of freedom , and the bond length only imposes 2@xmath11 constraints ) .",
    "a single mc step is performed in the following manner : an atom of species @xmath33 at position @xmath34 is randomly chosen and a transition to the state @xmath35 , @xmath36 is attempted . the change in energy",
    "is then calculated and the move is accepted or rejected according to the standard metropolis criterion .",

    "elastic forces are included by the stillinger - weber potential .",
    "the behavior of all critical quantities analyzed strongly indicated the presence of a closed second order line with the critical exponents of the ( rigid ) ising model .",

    "disagreement was also found in the simulations of exactly the same model but with ferromagnetic interactions @xcite .",
    "the reasons of these disagreements are not clear and should be further investigated .",
    "needless to say , however , that our conclusions should be viewed within the context of any numerical work , keeping in mind the finiteness of the systems used in the simulations .",
    "it is , therefore , clear that , on the basis of these data , the occurrence of a ( slow ) crossover toward fisher renormalized exponents can not be completely ruled out .",
    "a deeper investigation of this issue would require simulations on much larger system sizes , which is , basically , unfeasible with the present computer power .",
    "it would be , however , very interesting to investigate the critical behavior under stronger coupling conditions .",

    "<S> extensive monte carlo simulations in the semi - grand - canonical ensemble are used to study the critical behavior of a three - dimensional compressible ising model with antiferromagnetic interactions under constant volume conditions . </S>",
    "<S> elastic forces between spins are introduced by the stillinger - weber potential and energy parameters are chosen in such a way that antiparallel spin ordering is favored , analogous to the antiferromagnetic coupling in the rigid ising hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> all the quantities analyzed strongly indicate that the system remains in the universality class of the standard ( rigid ) three - dimensional ising model , in contrast with theoretical predictions .    </S>",
