    "transiting exoplanets are benchmark objects . like an eclipsing binary star ,",
    "a transiting exoplanet offers unique opportunities for a rich variety of follow - up studies due to its favorable orbital geometry .",
    "it is possible to measure a planet s fundamental bulk properties like mass and radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , study its atmosphere photometrically or spectroscopically @xcite , and measure the alignment between the planet s orbit and the host star s spin axis ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "more so than eclipsing binary stars , transiting exoplanets are difficult to detect .",
    "wide - field ground - based transit surveys have detected hundreds of hot jupiters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the sensitivity of these surveys falls off quickly at longer orbital periods @xcite and smaller planet radii @xcite .",
    "space telescopes like nasa s _ kepler _  observatory @xcite , with smaller fields of view but better photometric precision have been highly successful at detecting small planets @xcite , but these planets typically orbit faint stars due to the narrow survey design .",
    "_ kepler _  revolutionized our knowledge of exoplanets , but only a handful of _ kepler _ s discoveries orbit stars bright enough for detailed follow - up observations . in its extended k2 mission , _ kepler _  is surveying a larger area of sky and is finding more exciting planets suitable for follow - up observations @xcite , but planets transiting stars brighter than 9th magnitude remain a rare prize .",
    "pencil - beam ground - based transit surveys like mearth @xcite , apache @xcite , and trappist @xcite have found what are likely among the best planets in the sky for atmospheric characterization , but the number of transiting planets detected by those surveys to date is small enough to count on one hand @xcite .",
    "today , planets transiting the brightest known host stars in the sky were uncovered by years or decades of precise radial velocity ( rv ) measurements @xcite . while rv searches have been fruitful ,",
    "the observations are challenging , the surveys require many nights over many years on large telescopes , and the success rate of finding transiting planets is low .",
    "nasa s tess mission @xcite , an all - sky space - based transit survey , is expected to address the need for planets transiting bright host stars by discovering hundreds of the nearest and brightest transiting exoplanets in the sky @xcite , but tess wo nt begin collecting data until early 2018 .",
    "there is an immediate need for small planets transiting bright stars that can be studied before the launch of missions like tess and the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) .",
    "the lessons learned from these first planets to be examined in detail will help inform decisions about how to use resources like jwst to efficiently learn about exoplanets .    here",
    ", we announce the discovery of two super - earth - sized planets transiting the bright ( v = 8.94 , k = 7.07 ) nearby dwarf star hd  3167  using data from the k2 mission .",
    "the inner planet , hd  3167  b , is a 1.6 r@xmath0  super - earth that orbits its host every 0.96 days .",
    "hd  3167  b  has likely lost most of any atmosphere it once possessed due to the intense radiation environment in its short - period orbit @xcite .",
    "the outer planet , hd  3167  c , orbits in a 29.85 day period , and with a radius of 2.9 r@xmath0  likely has a thick gaseous envelope .",
    "the host star is both bright enough in visible wavelengths for precise rv follow - up to measure the planets masses , and bright enough in infrared wavelengths to spectroscopically interrogate hd  3167  c s atmosphere . in section [ observations ]",
    "we describe our observations of hd  3167 , our data reduction , and our analysis . in section [ validation ] , we describe our statistical validation of the planet candidates , and in section [ discussion ] , we discuss the hd  3167  planets and their importance in the context of the thousands of known transiting exoplanets .",
    "_ kepler _  observed hd  3167  between 3 january 2016 and 23 march 2016 during campaign 8 of its k2 mission .",
    "we identified two planet candidates transiting hd  3167  after processing pixel level data to produce a light curve , removing systematic effects due to _ kepler _ s unstable pointing @xcite , and searching for planets using a box least squares periodogram search @xcite .",
    "we extracted the light curve from a photometric aperture shaped like the image of the star on the detector , with an average radius of about 20 . after identifying the transits , we reprocessed the raw k2 light curve to remove systematics while simultaneously fitting for stellar variability and the two planets transit signals @xcite .",
    "the noise level in the first half of the k2 light curve is a _",
    "kepler_-like 10 ppm per six hours , but the second half of the light curve is about 80% noisier , likely due to _ kepler _ s more erratic motion during that part of the campaign when the median point - to - point motion increased from 0.13to 0.29 .",
    "the full k2 light curve is shown in figure [ lc ] .",
    "we measured transit parameters by fitting the two transit signals in the k2 light curve with @xcite models using a markov chain monte carlo algorithm with an affine invariant ensemble sampler @xcite .",
    "our model has 14 free parameters : two quadratic limb darkening coefficients ( using the @xmath2 and @xmath3 parametrization from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the uncertainty of each photometric data point in the first and second halves of the campaign , and for each planet the orbital period , transit time , cosine of orbital inclination ( @xmath4 ) , planet to star radius ratio ( @xmath5 ) , and scaled semimajor axis ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we assumed a circular orbit for the inner planet , and imposed a prior on the mean stellar density ( from the stellar mass and radius calculated in section [ spectroscopy ] ) to constrain the scaled semimajor axis .",
    "we accounted for _ kepler _ s 29.4 minute long - cadence integration time by oversampling the model light curve by a factor of 30 and performing a trapezoidal integration .",
    "we sampled the parameter space with 150 walkers evolved over 50,000 steps , and discarded the first 40,000 steps as `` burn - in . ''",
    "a calculation of the gelman - rubin potential scale reduction factors for each parameter ( all below 1.2 ) confirmed the mcmc fit had converged . the transit light curves are shown in the bottom panels of figure [ lc ] along with the best - fit model .",
    "transit parameters and uncertainties are listed in table [ bigtable ] .",
    "we observed hd  3167  with the tillinghast reflector echelle spectrograph ( tres ) on the 1.5 m telescope at the fred l. whipple observatory on mt .",
    "hopkins , az . we acquired one spectrum with a spectral resolving power of @xmath7 = 44,000 on 11 july 2016 . a four minute exposure yielded a spectrum with a signal - to - noise ratio of 71 per resolution element at 550 nm .",
    "we cross - correlated the spectrum with a number of templates from our library of synthetic spectra , and measured an absolute rv of @xmath8 @xmath9  from the best matched template .",
    "the cross correlation function showed no evidence for a second set of spectral lines , indicating there are no nearby , bright blended sources within one or two arcseconds .",
    "we measured spectroscopic parameters of hd  3167  using the stellar parameter classification tool ( spc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which works by cross - correlating observed spectra with a grid of synthetic model spectra generated from @xcite model atmospheres .",
    "the spc analysis revealed that hd  3167  has a temperature of @xmath10 k , metallicity of [ m / h ] = @xmath11 , surface gravity of @xmath12 , and has a low projected rotational velocity with only an upper limit on @xmath13 .",
    "we also measured the flux near the cores of the calcium ii h and k lines and calculated mt .",
    "wilson @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the star is evidently chromospherically inactive .",
    "we estimated fundamental stellar parameters using an online interface which , following @xcite , interpolates the star s v - magnitude , parallax , metallicity and effective temperature onto parsec model isochrones @xcite , assuming the lognormal initial mass function from @xcite .",
    "hd  3167  is a dwarf star slightly smaller than the sun , with a mass of 0.883  @xmath1 0.033  m@xmath16  and a radius of 0.828  @xmath1 0.028  r@xmath16 .",
    "the models predict a surface gravity of @xmath17 , consistent with the spectroscopic measurement from spc , indicating that our stellar parameters are sensible .",
    "stellar parameters are listed in table [ bigtable ] .",
    "we observed hd  3167  with the robo - ao adaptive optics system @xcite installed at the 2.1 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory @xcite .",
    "we observed hd  3167  with an _",
    "i_-band filter on 11 july 2016 , taking images at a rate of 8.6 hz for a total of 120 seconds . in post - processing , we shifted and added the images together using hd  3167  as a tip / tilt guide star .",
    "the resulting image showed no evidence for any stars other than hd  3167 .",
    "we estimated a contrast curve for the robo - ao image by measuring the residuals from resolution element - sized regions in the psf - subtracted image , as described by @xcite and jensen - clem et al .",
    "( 2016 , in prep ) .",
    "the robo - ao image excludes 5-sigma detections of stars 2 magnitudes fainter than hd  3167  at 0@xmath1825 and stars 5 magnitudes fainter at 1@xmath19 .",
    "the robo - ao field of view ( 36@xmath2036 ) does not cover the full photometric aperture , so we also inspected archival images from the palomar observatory sky survey to confirm there is no evidence for faint stars in the photometric aperture at wide separations .",
    "we validated the planetary nature of the candidates transiting hd  3167  using statistical techniques developed by @xcite as implemented in the ` vespa `  software package @xcite . `",
    "vespa ` calculates the false positive probability ( fpp ) of transiting planet candidates given knowledge about the location of the planets in the sky ( and hence the prevalence of potential background objects which could cause astrophysical false - positives ) as well as observational constraints .",
    "we calculated fpps of hd  3167  b and c taking into account constraints on the depth of a potential secondary eclipse in the k2 light curve , the ( lack of ) difference in depth between even and odd transits , and the constraints on fainter stars in the photometric aperture from archival imaging and robo - ao .",
    "we constrained the depth of possible secondary eclipses by measuring the scatter in the depths of putative eclipses at different phases in the planet s orbit , and conservatively chose limits of 12 ppm for the inner planet , and 40 ppm for the outer planet .",
    "we calculate fpps of roughly @xmath21 and @xmath22 for hd  3167  b  and hd  3167  c , respectively .",
    "the fpps for both candidates are low because k2 field 8 is at a high galactic latitude where the density of stars is low so there are few potential background contaminants .",
    "the fact that these candidates are found in a multi - planet system further lowers the fpps by about a factor of 30 , which we estimated using the number of single and multi - candidate systems we detected in our search of k2 campaign 8 , following @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the candidates transiting hd  3167  to be validated as genuine exoplanets .",
    "the main importance of the hd  3167  planetary system is due to the brightness and proximity of the host star . with a v - magnitude of 8.94 ,",
    "slow projected rotation of less than 2 @xmath9 , and low activity , hd  3167  is highly suitable for precise rv observations to measure the planets masses . if hd  3167  b  is rocky with a mass of about 4 m@xmath0 , it should induce rv variations with a semiamplitude of about 3 @xmath23 .",
    "depending on its composition , hd  3167  c  could induce rv variations with a semiamplitude of anywhere between 1 @xmath23(for a roughly 5 m@xmath0  planet ) and 3 @xmath23(for a roughly 15 m@xmath0  planet ) .",
    "these signals should be readily detectable with modern spectrographs .",
    "hd  3167  c  is one of the best currently known small planets for atmospheric characterization with transit transmission spectroscopy .",
    "we downloaded a list of transiting planets with radii smaller than 4 r@xmath0  from the nasa exoplanet archive @xcite and calculated the expected signal - to - noise ( @xmath24 ) one could hope to accumulate per transit compared to the expected scale height of each planets atmosphere .",
    "in particular , we calculated :        where @xmath27 is the planet s radius , @xmath28 is the star s radius , @xmath29 is the atmosphere s scale height , @xmath30 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath31 is the planet s equilibrium temperature , @xmath32 is the atmosphere s mean molecular weight , @xmath33 is the planets surface gravity , @xmath34 is the transit duration , and @xmath35 is the flux from the star .",
    "we calculated @xmath35 from the host stars h - band magnitudes to test suitability for observations with the hubble space telescope s wide field camera 3 instrument , and we assumed that planets less dense than rocky structural models @xcite have atmospheres dominated by molecular hydrogen , while planets consistent with rocky structural models have atmospheres dominated by heavier molecules ( like oxygen ) .",

    "this does nt necessarily mean atmospheric features will be detected in hd  3167  c   gj 1214 b is by far the most amenable small planet for transit spectroscopy , but its transmission spectrum is masked by clouds or hazes @xcite .",
    "indeed , three of the four small planets more amenable to atmospheric characterization than hd  3167  c  have flat transmission spectra inconsistent with a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere . a major goal for transmission spectroscopists",
    "is understanding which planets form thick clouds or hazes , and on which planets clear skies permit transit spectroscopy .",
    "when tess launches , it will likely find about 80 planets comparable to or better than hd  3167  c  for transmission spectroscopy ( as calculated above for existing planets ) . studying hd  3167  c",
    "now could inform the choice of which tess planets should be observed to most efficiently learn about the atmospheres of small planets .",
    "unlike most known multi - transiting systems , the planets in the hd  3167  system are widely separated in orbital period .",
    "the period ratio of @xmath44 = 31.1 is larger than the period ratios of 99% of all pairs of adjacent planets in the _ kepler _  data release 24 planet candidate catalog @xcite .",

    "b  is an example of an ultra - short period ( usp ) planet , as defined by @xcite ( although its period is longer than the 12 hour cutoff chosen by * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite found that in the _ kepler _  sample , essentially all usp planets have radii smaller than 2 r@xmath0 , indicating that the intense radiation so close to their host stars has stripped the planets of thick gaseous envelopes . even though rv studies have shown that 1.6 r@xmath0  planets often have thick gaseous envelopes , hd  3167  b s radiation environment",
    "makes it likely its composition is also predominantly rocky .    finally , we note that the short period of hd  3167  b  makes it likely that spectroscopic observations of hd  3167  c s atmosphere might overlap with a transit of the inner planet ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "this could be an efficient way to rule out a hydrogen - dominated atmosphere for hd  3167  b. observers should be cautious , however , to ensure that a transit of hd  3167  b  not interfere with out - of - transit observations necessary for calibration .",
