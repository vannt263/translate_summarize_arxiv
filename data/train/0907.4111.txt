    "soft momentum exchanges between particles are mediated by the fields , while hard momentum exchanges are described by a collision term including binary elastic collisions .",
    "this way , we are able to provide an estimate of the coupling of jets to a hot plasma which is independent of infrared cutoffs .    we also simulate plasmas with local momentum - space anisotropies , which occur in heavy - ion collisions due to the longitudinal expansion during the very early stages of the plasma evolution .",
    "these plasmas develop chromo - weibel instabilities  @xcite , which lead to the formation of long - wavelength chromo - fields with @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "the total cross section is given by @xmath18 where we have introduced a lower cutoff @xmath19 . to avoid double - counting",
    ", this cutoff should be on the order of the hardest field mode that can be represented on the given lattice , @xmath20 , with the lattice spacing @xmath21 . this way soft momentum exchanges are mediated by the fields while hard momentum exchanges are described by the collision term . for a more detailed discussion",
    "see @xcite .",
    "we first consider heat - baths of particles with different densities @xmath22 and temperatures @xmath23 .",
    "we simulate an undersaturated gluon plasma due to numerical restrictions ( see @xcite ) and later extrapolate to thermal systems with physical densities and temperatures . for a given lattice ( or @xmath19 )",
    "we take the initial energy density of the thermalized fields to be @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a bose distribution normalized to the assumed particle density @xmath22 , and @xmath26 is the riemann zeta function .",
    "the initial field spectrum is fixed to coulomb gauge and @xmath27 .",
    "we study colorless bunches of test particles that allow us to restrict to collisional energy loss and momentum broadening due to elastic collisions only .",
    "both @xmath28 and the differential energy loss @xmath0 are independent of the separation scale @xmath19 .",

    "we also provide an estimate for the nuclear modification factor @xmath46 due to elastic energy loss in a classical yang - mills field .",
    "this is of relevance for collisions of heavy nuclei at high energies : the large number of gluons produced in the central rapidity region can be described as a classical field for a short time  ( see e.g. @xcite ) until the field modes decohere and thermalize  @xcite . from the simulations presented above , we obtained the elastic energy loss @xmath0 . for large @xmath19 ( on the order of the `` saturation momentum '' @xmath47 )",
    "most of the energy density is due to the classical field . in a thermal system at @xmath48",
    "mev the energy density is about 17  gev/@xmath49 , which is an appropriate average over the first 1  fm / c of a central au+au collision at rhic energy  @xcite .",
    "an estimate for the nuclear modification factor @xmath46 at the parton level ( neglecting hadronization ) can be written as  @xcite @xmath50 @xmath51 denotes the fractional energy loss up to @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the initial @xmath30 distribution of jets , where @xmath54 .",
    "[ fig : r_aa ] shows the result for @xmath46 .",
    "the experimentally observed flat @xmath55 can not be fully accounted for by early - stage elastic energy loss in the classical field background , but our result shows that this contribution is significant and can not be neglected .",
    "as studied in detail in @xcite , instability growth in unstable plasmas leads to a direction dependent @xmath1 .",
    "we describe the broadening of the hard ( now colored ) test particles in the transverse @xmath56 and longitudinal @xmath57 directions via the variances @xmath58 the ratio @xmath59 can be roughly associated with the ratio of jet correlation widths in azimuth and rapidity : @xmath60 .",
    "the numerical simulations of unstable plasmas obtain @xcite @xmath61 we propose to look for this effect by using the greatly improved experimental methods for full jet reconstruction @xcite .",
    "in particular , one should use cones with an elliptical base and determine its major axis in the @xmath62-@xmath63 plane by maximizing the energy contained in the cone .",
    "if the system is isotropic , the angle should be uniformly distributed while the effect of instabilities should lead to a preferred orientation of the major axis in the @xmath63 direction .",
    "another , possibly more practical way of experimentally determining such an anisotropy of the jet is to keep the circular base and study correlations among the particles within the cone .",
