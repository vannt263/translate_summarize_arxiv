    "single - molecule junctions offer a rich variety of effects , including switching , rectification , photo - activity and thermoelectricity @xcite . especially intriguing - due to its counter - intuitive nature -",
    "is the negative differential resistance ( ndr ) effect : when a molecular junction is placed under a voltage bias , the current is typically a monotonically increasing function of bias ( resulting in the usual positive differential resistance ) .",
    "however , in certain situations , the current decreases with increasing bias , resulting in the so - called ndr .",
    "this effect has been observed in a large variety of metal - molecule - metal junctions , including organic and metallo - organic molecules and even dna junctions @xcite .",
    "the origin of the ndr , being unclear , has spurred a large number of theoretical studies .",
    "the main sources for ndr discussed in the literature are voltage - dependent electron - phonon interactions @xcite and a potential - drop - induced shifting of the molecular orbitals @xcite .",
    "in addition , recent studies indicate that ndr may originate from image - charge effects @xcite and a change in the effective coupling between the molecular levels and the electrodes @xcite .    in a recent experiment @xcite ,",
    "the transport properties of a molecular junction composed of a symmetric metallo - oranic molecule between two gold electrodes were studied in parallel to force measurements on the molecular junction , which determine the effective coupling strength between the molecule and the electrodes @xcite .",
    "the authors found that ndr appears only for junctions with intermediate coupling , at a relatively low bias of @xmath0 ev , which is much smaller than the homo - lumo gap ; yet some features in the local density of states ( ldos ) seem to appear at these energies .",
    "a major finding described in ref .",
    "@xcite was that the peak current is correlated with a maximum in the molecule - electrode coupling .",
    "here we suggest a novel mechanism for the ndr , which is in line with the above experimental findings .",
    "the mechanism that we suggest relies on the assumption that the coulomb interactions between electrons on the molecule and electrons on the electrode ( residing on the atoms connected to the molecule ) are significant and are not screened out by the free electrons in the electrode .",
    "theoretical simulations indicate that when molecular junctions are formed , atoms from the electrode may extend towards the molecule @xcite , thereby reducing the screening in the bridging atoms .",
    "the effect of such interface coulomb interactions has recently been studied theoretically , showing both that the magnitude of these interactions can be large ( a few electron volts ) and that they strongly affect the molecular orbitals @xcite , via the formation of image charges .",
    "the importance of considering image charges in calculating i - v characteristics was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the model we consider and the mechanism we propose are depicted in fig .",
    "the system under consideration is composed of a single molecular level , say the lowest unoccupied molecular level ( lumo ) , coupled to the electronic states in the electrode .",
    "we consider coulomb interactions both on the molecular level ( leading to the well - known coulomb blockade @xcite ) and between the molecular level and the electrons on the atom connected to the molecular bridge ( bridging atom ) .",
    "when an electron hops from the bridging atom to the lumo , a hole is left behind . due to the coulomb interactions ,",
    "the electron on the lumo and hole are correlated , and this correlation renormalizes the hopping matrix element between the lumo and the bridging atom , thereby increasing the coupling between the molecule and the electrode ( as we explicitly show in what follows ) . in the presence of a bias voltage , the rate of electron hopping between the electrode and the lumo changes , which induces a bias - dependent normalization of the coupling",
    ". when the bias reaches the lumo energy level , the current is maximal and thus the renormalization is maximal , and as the resonance is passed , the effective coupling is reduced and ( self - consistently ) the current is reduced , resulting in ndr .",
    "the starting point is the typical hamiltonian for a molecular junction @xcite : & = & _ l+_r+_m+_t+_i _ l , r & = & _ k _ k c^_k , l / r c_k , l / r _ m & = & _ 0 _ d^_d_+ u_0 d^_d_d^_d _ _ t & = & -t _ ( c^_,l d_+ c^_,r d_+ ) _ i & = & u_1 ( _ l _ d+_r _ d ) [ hamiltonian ] where @xmath1 creates an electron with momentum @xmath2 and spin @xmath3 at the left / right electrode , and @xmath4 creates an electron with spin @xmath3 at the lumo .",
    "the first three terms are a typical description of transport through molecular junctions , with metallic electrodes , molecular orbital energy @xmath5 , and tunneling matrix element @xmath6 connecting the molecule and the electrodes . the tunneling from the electrodes to",
    "the molecule occurs through the left and right bridging atoms , defined by the electron creation operators @xmath7 for the left and right electrodes , as depicted in fig .",
    "the interaction term with @xmath8 describes the molecular charging energy and leads to the coulomb blockade .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian describes the coulomb interaction between the electron on the molecule and an electron in the bridging site , where @xmath9 the interaction strength and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the electron number operators on the molecule and the bridging site , respectively . in ref .",
    "@xcite , such an interaction term was considered , and its effect on the molecular level renormalization was studied using various theoretical approaches theoretical in equilibrium conditions .    to study the effect of the interface coulomb interaction described in @xmath12 , we introduce a mean - field decoupling for the interaction term c^_l , c_l , d^_d_-c^_l , d_d^_c_l ,- d^_c_l , c^_l , d _  [ meanfield ]",
    "where for the sake of clarity , we discuss the interaction with the left electrode and later generalize the expressions to include the right electrode.this decoupling scheme renormalizes the tunneling hamiltonian into _ t=- _",
    "( c^_,l d_+ c^_,r",
    "d_+ )  , introducing effective tunneling matrix elements @xmath13 where @xmath14 .    before proceeding ,",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "first , note that we use the term `` renormalization '' to describe an interaction - induced change in the coupling , even if the interaction is treated on the mean - field level .",
    "second , we point out that the interaction term can also be decoupled diagonally , resulting in a shift of the local energy levels in the molecule due to the density in the bridging site and vice versa . while this term may be ( and probably is ) finite and important , we choose here to ignore it so as to isolate the effect of the tunneling renormalization and its bias dependence .",
    "such a separation between the different mechanisms can not be introduced can not be introduced in , e.g. first principle calculations @xcite , where only the wave functions ( or more accurately the kohn - sham orbitals ) and the total current are calculated , and the mechanism for ndr needs to be inferred from them .",
    "third , we note that while a decoupling of @xmath12 to spin - flip processes is formally possible , it is evident that the self - consistent solution for such processes results in vanishing terms , i.e. , the coulomb interaction can not induce spin - flip - tunneling process .",
    "finally , we point out the similarity between the decoupling scheme of eq .",
    "[ meanfield ] and that of exciton interactions in bilayer systems @xcite .",
    "indeed , the process we describe above can be envisioned as a formation of a bound exciton at the molecule - electrode interface , with @xmath9 being the exciton binding energy . in ref .",
    "@xcite the interplay between exciton tunneling and binding was demonstrated , in similarity with the results presented in this study .",
    "to evaluate the tunneling matrix elements , we use the non - equilibrium green s function formalism and write @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the equal times lesser green s functions @xcite .",
    "the green s function may be evaluated via the dyson equations for the keldysh functions @xcite , and the full details of the derivation are provided in the appendix .",
    "the final result of the calculation is a set of self - consistent equations for the tunneling matrix elements , the effective level broadening , and the green s function of the electrons in the molecule ,    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the green s function in the molecule without the electrodes , which is obtained from the equations of motion method @xcite and captures the coulomb blockade .",
    "@xmath19 is the retarded green s function of electrons in the molecule , @xmath20 is the dos at the bridging site , @xmath21 are the fermi distributions in the left / right electrodes ( with the corresponding chemical potentials and temperatures , which may be different ) , @xmath22 is the electrode band width , and @xmath23 is the level broadening due to the electrodes ( taken in the wide - band limit @xcite ) , renormalized by the affective tunneling matrix elements @xmath24 . in",
    "what follows the bare chemical potentials are set as the zero of energy , and the right chemical potential is shifted be the bias voltage @xmath25 .",
    "the self - consistent procedure is then the following : starting from an initial value for the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath26 , the green s function @xmath18 and @xmath19 are calculated using eq .",

    "are calculated using eq .",
    "( [ subeq3]-[subeq4 ] ) .",
    "once they are obtained , the green s functions are re - calculated with the new value of @xmath23 .",
    "the process is then repeated until self - consistency is achieved , i.e. until the changes in the green s functions and @xmath23 between successive iterations are smaller than some numerical tolerance .    from eq .",
    "( [ subeq1]-[subeq4 ] ) , one can see that even at zero bias the tunneling element is renormalized , since even at zero bias there is hybridization between the lumo and the electrode states .",
    "in addition , note that in the absence of tunneling ( i.e. , @xmath27 ) the self - consistent @xmath26 always vanishes , i.e. , the coulomb interaction can not induce tunneling but can only enhance it ( this is the reason for the vanishing of the spin - flip terms ) .",
    "once the the green s functions are obtained , the current can be calculated via @xcite ( assuming symmetric electrodes ) i=_w d(f_l()-f_r( ) )  .[meirwingreen ]",
    "for the numerical calculation , we chose numerical values for the different parameters that are representative of molecular junctions , but we stress that we are aiming at a qualitative demonstration of the ndr rather than a quantitative fit to experiments .",
    "we used @xmath28 ev for the lumo , @xmath29 ev for the tunneling element , @xmath30 for the dos ( resulting in level broadening of @xmath31 mev ) , @xmath32 for the bandwidth and @xmath33 k for the temperature .",
    "the chemical potentials were set as the zero energy , and the right electrode fermi distribution was shifted by the bias voltage @xmath25 or a temperature difference @xmath34 .",
    "the coulomb energies were extracted from an ohno parametrization of the electrostatic interaction @xcite , where the coulomb interaction term depends on the distance between two electrons as @xmath35 ( with @xmath36 in angstroms ) .",
    "a typical value @xmath37 ev and a distance of @xmath38    from the molecule to the bridging site yield a typical @xmath39 ev which , if not screened , is a rather strong interaction .",
    "we point that the onsite coulomb interaction term @xmath8 is not especially important for the mechanism of ndr we suggest here , yet we keep @xmath8 finite to agree with parameters presented in previous literature.@xcite    in fig .",

    "[ fig3 ] shows both the i - v curve ( blue solid line ) and the effective coupling @xmath23 ( red solid line ) as a function of bias voltage , with @xmath39 ev .",
    "one can see that the effective @xmath23 is strongly bias dependent , with a maximal change where the bias reaches the lumo energy ( indicated by a dashed line ) .",
    "the inset shows the experimental results , where the i - v curve ( blue ) and the force constant ( red ) , which is proportional to the coupling , are presented ( adapted from ref .",

    "@xcite is shown , presenting the current ( blue ) and force constant ( red ) .",
    "the dashed lines show the position of the maximum coupling , demonstrating the agreement between theory and experiment . ]",
    "so it seems that one could explain the ndr in terms of an inhomogeneous dependence of the effective coupling on the bias voltage .",
    "but what is the origin of this inhomogeneity ? to answer this , we look carefully at the expression for @xmath26 in eq .",
    "( [ subeq4 ] ) , and investigate its integrand , i_()= ( f_l()+f_r ( ) ) _ g^r _ ( )  .",
    "[ itau]for the sake of simplicity we look at the integrand @xmath41 for a non - interacting molecule , where the green s function has the simple form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the molecular level and @xmath23 is the level broadening ( spin - dependence was omitted ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) we plot the two parts of @xmath41 , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 as a function of @xmath46 for @xmath47 ev ( at room temperature ) and bias voltage @xmath48 ev , i.e. at the resonance .",
    "the most obvious feature is that @xmath45 changes sign as @xmath46 crosses @xmath5 .",
    "this can be understood as the fact that hole - like excitations ( @xmath49 ) having a positive contribution to the bound exciton amplitude , and electron - like excitations have a negative contribution to the amplitude of the bound exciton . in fig .",

    "specifically , we look at the pvr as a function of the distance @xmath36 between the molecule and the bridging site .",
    "this distance affects both the interface coulomb interaction @xmath9 ( via the ohno parametrization ) and the bare tunneling element @xmath54 , which decreases exponentially with the distance as @xmath55 @xcite ( here we take @xmath56  , but changing this parameter has only a quantitative effect on the results presented below ) .",
    "these two effects - the decrease in the interface coulomb energy and the reduction of the tunneling element - compete with each other in determining the magnitude of the ndr , since the smaller the bare tunneling matrix element , the larger the relative effect of the interface coulomb interaction .    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the pvr vs. @xmath36 is plotted , and a well - defined maximum is observed , demonstrating this competition . note that for short distances the pvr tends to unity , implying that the ndr vanishes , and the same is true for large @xmath36 .",
    "this relationship may explain the experimental observation @xcite that only some junctions exhibit ndr , which is correlated with their conductance ( and hence with their molecule - interface geometry and the values of the bare coupling and the interface coulomb interaction ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] predicts that within a specific molecular junction , the pvr can be reduced or increased by squeezing or stretching the junction respectively , which is well within current experimental reach @xcite .    another experimental test which may help differentiating between possible origins for the ndr is the temperature dependence of the current ( and resulting pvr ) .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite show a molecular junction with pvr of @xmath57 , similar to that of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that molecular junctions that exhibit @xmath58 at room temperature can have either similar or very high ( @xmath59 ) pvr at low temperatures , depending on the structure of the molecular junction .",
    "thus , the different mechanisms that give rise to ndr may be differentiated from one another by their temperature dependence . within the calculation presented here , temperature appear explicitly only via the fermi functions , yet due to the coupling renormalization ,",
    "the level broadening @xmath23 also depends on temperature . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , we plot the i - v curves for the same parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] for temperatures @xmath60 k. as may be seen , the ndr depends very weakly on temperature .",
    "this suggests that in situations in which the ndr is determined by a change in the coupling ( as opposed to a shift in the transmission resonances ) there will not be a substantial difference in the pvr between low and high temperatures .    , which affects both the interface interaction @xmath9 and the bare tunneling elements @xmath54 ( see text ) .",
    "the strong dependence of the pvr on @xmath36 can be tested experimentally , and is in accord with the experimental findings .",
    "inset : i - v curves for different temperatures @xmath61 k , demonstrating a very weak dependence of the current on the temperature .",
    "this weak dependence can also serve as a test for the origin of the ndr . ]",
    "the coupling between the molecular levels and the electrode levels is essential not only for the i - v characteristics of molecular junctions but also for the thermal transport and the thermo - electricity in molecular junctions , which have been central research themes in recent years @xcite .",
    "the dynamical coupling renormalization mechanism , described here to address the ndr in molecular junctions , may play a role in determining , for example , the thermoelectric conversion properties of such junctions . to demonstrate this , we study the response of the molecular junction to a constant temperature difference @xmath62 k ( obtained by keeping @xmath63 at room temperature and increasing @xmath64 by @xmath34 ) .",
    "when a temperature difference is present , a current @xmath65 starts flowing through the junction . applying a bias voltage gradually reduces the current until at a voltage @xmath66 , the current vanishes . at both",
    "vanishing current or zero bias , the power output of the junction vanishes , and in between the power output reaches a maximum , and that point is considered the preferable working point for thermoelectric junctions @xcite . since the junction is strongly out of equilibrium at maximum power ( as opposed to the linear response regime ) , it is expected that there will be a large renormalization of the coupling , which will affect the maximal power . in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the power output @xmath67 of the junction with the parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] at a constant temperature difference of @xmath62 k is plotted as a function of the voltage bias , for two values of the interface coulomb interaction @xmath68 ev ( dashed line ) and @xmath69 ev ( solid line ) .",

    "k , for @xmath39 ev ( blue solid line ) and @xmath70 ev ( dashed red line ) . ]",
    "to summarize , we suggested that the coulomb interaction across the molecule - electrode interface induces a dynamical , bias - dependent renormalization of the molecule - electrode coupling .",
    "the origin of the change in the coupling is the binding of electrons in the molecule and holes in the electrode atoms closest to the molecule .",
    "the effective coupling has a maximum when the bias reaches the lumo energy level , resulting in an inhomogeneous i - v curve and a negative differential resistance .",
    "the theoretical features , including the relation between the coupling inhomogeneity and the ndr and changes in the pvr are in accord with recent experimental findings .",
    "we suggested various experiments to test the origin of the ndr and predicted their outcome .",
    "finally , we demonstrated that the mechanism we suggest affects other transport properties , such as thermoelectric conversion power output .",
    "we conclude by noting that most current theories of transport through molecular junctions use a method combining density functional theory ( dft ) and non - equilibrium green s functions , where the electrodes are treated as non - interacting far from the molecule itself .",
    "the self - consistent correction to the coupling that was introduce here , ( [ subeq1]-[subeq4 ] ) , can in principle be inserted into these calculations with parameters calculated within the dft scheme .",
    "this provides a correction to transport calculations of molecular junctions that may prove important in evaluating transport properties from first principles .",
