    "spatiotemporal chaos ( stc ) occurs in many spatially extended deterministic systems and remains notoriously difficult to characterize @xcite .",
    "therefore one may attempt to map such deterministic chaotic systems onto stochastic models for which many more analytical methods are available .",
    "it is then tacitly assumed that , after sufficient coarse graining of the deterministic model , the role of deterministic chaos can be taken over by the noise in the stochastic system . a critical test of the validity of such mappings are the predictions for the transitions between qualitatively different states that extended chaotic systems display .",
    "the key question is then : _ are transitions in deterministic chaotic systems governed by the universality classes of stochastic systems ? _    as is known for a variety of spatiotemporal chaotic systems @xcite and as we will show below for the deterministic system at hand , chaotic states in extended systems often display a mixture of rather regularly propagating structures and more disordered behavior .",
    "when the propagating structures , that we will refer to as `` solitons '' ( following @xcite ) have a finite lifetime , it may seem that they can be ignored after sufficient coarse graining .",
    "we will find strong indications that this is _ not _ always the case , and we will give an example where their influence may even be so strong as to change the nature of the transition . we will also show that extending simple stochastic models with the appropriate solitonic degrees of freedom can mimic this behavior quite accurately : not only can we change the order of the transition , we can also get transient non - universal scaling of the type observed in coupled map lattices @xcite .",
    "therefore we conclude that , in many cases , deterministic chaotic systems _ can indeed _ be mapped to stochastic models . a short account of our work",
    "has already been published @xcite .",
    "chat and manneville  @xcite introduced the notion of a universal transition to extended chaos via `` spatiotemporal intermittency '' ( sti )  @xcite in a study of the _ deterministic _ damped kuramoto - sivashinsky partial differential equation @xcite .",
    "sti states are composed of `` turbulent '' ( chaotic ) and `` laminar '' ( ordered ) patches , and the laminar patches remain so except for contamination by turbulence at their boundaries .",
    "these states are conjectured to occur quite generally when , locally , laminar and turbulent dynamics are separated by a subcritical bifurcation , and indeed a large number of different experimental systems and theoretical models display sti @xcite .    as a function of their parameters , sti systems display a transition from states where the turbulence eventually dies out to states where the turbulence spreads and dominates .",
    "pomeau proposed  @xcite an analogy between this transition and the phase transition of the stochastic process known as directed percolation ( dp ) ; for an introduction to dp , see e.g.  @xcite . in directed percolation",
    "one considers the spreading of `` activity '' in an absorbing , inactive background .",
    "earlier , grassberger  @xcite and janssen  @xcite had conjectured that any @xmath0 process with an unique absorbing state should be in the same directed percolation universality class .",
    "relating laminar to inactive and turbulent to active states appears to map spatiotemporal intermittency to directed percolation . to verify whether _ deterministic _ chaotic models with an absorbing state would be in the dp universality class , chat and manneville introduced a very simple coupled map lattice ( cml ) that displays sti and numerically obtained the critical exponents that characterize the transition from inactive to active states .",
    "surprisingly , these critical exponents appear to vary with the parameters and are in general different from the dp values .",
    "therefore the chat ",
    "manneville model appears to be _ not _ in the dp universality class and not even universal .",
    "grassberger and schreiber  @xcite pointed out that the presence of long lived traveling structures which they call `` solitons '' in the chat ",
    "manneville model may lead to large crossover times , and conjectured that in the long - time limit the behavior of the chat",
    " manneville model would be in the dp universality class .",
    "recently , the chat  manneville model with an asynchronous update rule was studied  @xcite . here",
    "random sites are chosen to be iterated forward while keeping the others unaltered .",
    "for this model , the solitons observed for the standard synchronous update rule are suppressed and the critical exponents are universal with dp values , implying that the chat  manneville model with asynchronous updating belongs to the dp universality class .",
    "however , the asynchronous updating introduces an element of stochasticity into the model , thus ruining the deterministic character of the original model .      in this paper",
    "we will study a _",
    "deterministic _ extension of the chat ",
    "manneville cml that facilitates the tuning of the soliton properties .",
    "we will demonstrate that the influence of solitons may be much more profound than setting a crossover time , since they appear to be able to change the type of transition from second to first order .",
    "the role of the solitons is further illustrated in an extension of the _ stochastic _ domany - kinzel cellular automaton . in its standard form",
    ", all sites of this model can be either active or inactive , but we will add a `` solitonic '' degree of freedom that mimics the behavior of the solitons in the cml s .",
    "the mean field equations of this stochastic model show a transition from second order dp - like , behavior to a first order transition when the soliton lifetimes are increased .",
    "numerical studies of this stochastic model also find evidence for such a crossover to first order behavior , although it is very difficult to asses the asymptotic behavior for our model . in any case , we present strong numerical evidence that the transition is not an ordinary second order transition and that there is no asymptotic scaling regime , although there are appears to be a transient which displays non - universal scaling behavior .",
    "our study illustrates that for extended systems it is a difficult task to faithfully map a deterministic system to a stochastic counterpart . in this particular case ,",
    "localized propagating structures can be identified as responsible for the breakdown of dp universality , but one can imagine that less easily identified properties of the deterministic dynamics could be responsible for such a breakdown in other systems .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ scml ]",
    "we discuss the coupled map lattices .",
    "starting from a brief discussion of the classic chat - manneville model , we introduce our extension to lattices of two - dimensional maps in section [ ss2d ] .",
    "we show that the new parameter that is introduced has a profound effect on the importance of `` solitons '' , and that long living solitons change the transition from inactive to active states from a second to a first order transition in section [ sssol ] . in the second order regime",
    ", we estimate the bulk critical exponents using finite size scaling techniques in section [ ssfinite ] , and measure spreading exponents in section [ ssspread ] .",
    "all this data is consistent with the coupled map lattice being in the universality class of directed percolation with infinitely many absorbing states , provided that soliton lifetimes are short . in section [ sstoch ] we discuss the extension of the standard domany - kinzel cellular automata which includes new degrees of freedom that mimic the solitons of the coupled map lattices .",
    "the mean field equations for this model are studied in section [ ssmft ] , and these show a transition from second to first order behavior as a function of the soliton lifetimes .",
    "we study the phenomenology and its statistical bulk properties of the full model in the soliton rich regime in section [ ssphe ] .",
    "the behavior of the model in the soliton rich regime is quite distinct from an ordinary second order transition .",
    "the model introduced by chat and manneville consists of coupled maps , each of which either performs `` laminar '' or chaotic motion .",
    "the model was motivated by the fact that studies of the deterministic partial differential equations , such as the damped kuramoto - sivashinsky equation , are numerically quite demanding and had not provided enough precision to allow a definitive comparison to dp @xcite . in one spatial dimension",
    "their coupled map lattice was defined according to @xmath1 where the subscripts @xmath2 denote the spatial position , @xmath3 is the discrete time and @xmath4 .",
    "this expression is a discrete approximation of diffusive coupling in one dimension and introduces spatial correlations in the system ; the parameter @xmath5 is a measure of the coupling strength between a site @xmath2 and its two nearest neighbors at sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the map @xmath8 is chosen such that locally the scalar field @xmath9 can be in either of two states : the absorbing ( laminar ) or the chaotic ( turbulent ) one . when @xmath10 , @xmath8 is a standard tent map of the form @xmath11 which displays chaotic behavior , while in the region where @xmath12 , @xmath8 is simply the identity and leads to a laminar state .",
    "the sharp discontinuity in @xmath8 ensures that the two states are distinguishable at each site .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 determines the steepness of the tent map as well as the transition ratio from the chaotic to the laminar regime in the absence of coupling .",
    "the form of the diffusive coupling ensures that turbulent sites can not be spontaneously generated in a background of laminar sites : states where all sites are laminar remain so , and the laminar state is truly absorbing .",
    "the laminar state is not unique : updating a state where all sites are in the laminar regime @xmath14 leads , via the diffusion operator , to a state where all variables are equal to the global average value @xmath15 .",
    "once initiated , turbulent activity can spread through this cml by infecting laminar patches from their boundaries .",
    "the effectiveness of the resulting spreading of the chaos depends on the values of @xmath16 and @xmath5 .",
    "suppose we study the behavior of this system by keeping @xmath16 fixed while varying the coupling strength @xmath5 .",
    "completely analogous to dp , a critical value @xmath17 exists , such that for @xmath18 an absorbing state is reached with unit probability while sustained chaotic behavior ( in the thermodynamic limit ) is found for @xmath19 .",
    "taking the density of chaotic sites or `` activity '' @xmath20 as an order parameter , transitions from a `` laminar '' state ( where @xmath20 decays to zero ) to a `` turbulent '' state ( where @xmath20 reaches a finite value in an infinite system ) can be studied .",
    "coupled map lattice s can , in principle , be related to continuous time physical systems of weakly coupled elements by interpreting the map @xmath8 as a return map on a poincar section .",
    "the time spent by two different sites between successive returns would in general be different for systems without periodic external forcing , and this was precisely the motivation for the asynchronous update rule in @xcite .",
    "however , here we wish to mimic the variations in return times in a _ deterministic _ fashion .",
    "this motivated us to introduce a second field in the cml .",
    "note that the simplest chaotic oscillator would be a system of three phase space dimensions , like the lorenz equations .",
    "applying a poincar section reduces such a system to a two - dimensional map .",
    "this is also the case in systems with external periodic forcing . here",
    "the simplest realization would be systems like a damped nonlinear pendulum or duffing oscillator with a time - periodic forcing .",
    "a poincar section again reduces the system to a two - dimensional map and after the synchronous iteration the respective units are still at equal time .",
    "we therefore replace the single variable map @xmath21 used in eq .",
    "( [ cm ] ) , by a new map with an additional variable @xmath22 : @xmath23 here @xmath8 is the same map as before and the new parameter @xmath24 is the jacobian of the full two - dimensional local map ; this map is invertible for any non - zero @xmath24 and becomes increasingly two - dimensional with @xmath25 .",
    "the change in the local map ( [ cm ] ) is analogous to how the 2d hnon map  @xcite is constructed from the 1d logistic map , except that @xmath26 appears here on the right hand side instead of @xmath27 .",
    "this ensures that the absorbing state fixed points @xmath28 of the old cml ( [ cm ] ) are mapped to the laminar fixed point @xmath29 in the new cml .",
    "the model ( [ 2dima]-[2dimb ] ) is a completely deterministic system with no element of stochasticity and is updated synchronously .",
    "the value of @xmath9 determines , as in model ( [ cm ] ) , whether a given site is  active  or  inactive  . starting from the chat - manneville case ( @xmath30 ) we can follow the transition between laminar and chaotic states . as we will see below ,",
    "the new parameter @xmath24 actually opens up the possibility to study the effect of the `` solitons '' on the dynamical states and transitions of cmls ; this appears to be a more important issue than the dimensionality of the local map .      .",

    "either be absorbing or active ; the incoming manifold of the saddle point acts as a separatrix .",
    "the transition that occurs here as the saddle - node bifurcation is crossed leads to a finite jump in the value of @xmath109 in the active state , which is indicative of a first order transition . _",

    "[ figac1 ] we show the results of these calculations for @xmath106 ranging from 0.612 to 0.621 .    clearly , the decay of activity looks quite different from dp .",
    "if we focus on the activity as a function of @xmath106 for a fixed large time @xmath63 , we find a very abrupt transition at @xmath177 from an inactive to an active state , with a value of the activity given by the `` plateau '' that can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figac1 ] .",
    "this behavior is indicative of a first order transition , consistent with the mean field theory for large soliton lifetimes .",

    "when @xmath106 is small enough , the activity will decay faster than a power - law .",
    "when @xmath106 large enough so that active states will spread , we are certainly above the transition and the activity will reach a plateau value . for dp ,",
    "there is a critical value where the activity decays as a power - law , but this is not necessarily the case in our model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figac1 ] there is a transient decay towards the plateau value which can look like a power - law , as shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ figac ] . for a transient period that in this case goes up to @xmath178 , it is possible to find values of @xmath106 such that the decay of @xmath20 appears to be a power - law with a non - dp exponent .",
    "for the example shown , a reasonable scaling can be obtained over 2 decades .",
    "we speculate that this may be the origin of the non - universal power - laws observed in coupled map lattices @xcite .",
    "however , for this to be real asymptotic scaling , one should be able to have this scaling extend to arbitrary large times ; however the activity curves for sizes 200 , 2000 and 20000 all bend downwards at nearly the same time ; hence there is no hope that increasing the systemsize extends the time interval over which apparent scaling can be found . for long times",
    "the activity either decays rapidly , or first hits a plateau .",
    "clearly , the transition is not an ordinary 2nd order transition .     for @xmath170 , @xmath171 in an ensemble of @xmath179 systems of @xmath180 , showing the appearance of quasi - power - law decay .",
    "the three curves correspond to @xmath181 , and @xmath182 respectively , and are shifted by 30% for clarity .",
    "the three straight lines corresponds to power - laws with exponents @xmath183 and @xmath184 . in particular",
    "the scaling in the system for @xmath185 looks rather convincing with an exponent of @xmath184 .",
    ", width=321 ]    is this transition now an ordinary 1st order transition ? when we increase the time scale @xmath63 where we inspect the average activity , the transition becomes sharper , and the transition value @xmath186 will shift .",
    "we do not see evidence for @xmath186 going to a well - defined asymptotic value when @xmath63 goes to infinity , at least not on the timescales that we can probe numerically , and in this sense the transition is not truly first order .",
    "we will argue now that the plateau indeed does not represent the truly asymptotic behavior .",
    "let us return to fig .",
    "[ fig12c ] , where the activity appears to arrive at the plateau ( the overall activity appears to approach a constant ) .",
    "however , around @xmath187 a large `` hole '' opens up .",
    "once the size of this hole becomes larger than twice the lifetime of the solitons , it becomes unlikely that colliding solitons will create new activity there and `` heal '' the hole .",
    "in fact , for this particular example the hole did spread out and the system decayed to the inactive state .",
    "a closer inspection of the dynamical states that occur when the activity drops below the plateau value , shows that this is the general scenario : the nucleation and subsequent spreading of a large inactive droplet is what dominates the asymptotic decay of the active states here .     and",

    "width=321 ]    the spreading or shrinking of a large hole is governed by the propagation velocity of the coarse grained domain - walls between active and inactive patches .",
    "what we have found is that the apparent first order transition point @xmath186 does not coincide with the point @xmath189 where this velocity changes sign .",
    "we illustrate this property by following the dynamics of a large inactive droplet for @xmath188 , where the system has a well defined plateau in the activity ( see fig .",
    "[ figac1 ] ) .",
    "thus @xmath190 , but nevertheless , a hole of size 5000 grows as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fignotheal ] . a hole of size 500",
    "is healed for these same parameter values , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fignotheal ] .",
    "the solitons in our model thus introduce an additional length - scale of order @xmath191 , and as a result the size of the _ inactive _ holes becomes of importance .",
    "when such holes are smaller than @xmath192 , solitons will penetrate deeply enough to collide and create new patches of activity within this hole .",
    "since the first order transition is triggered by the solitons , this indicates that the velocity of the domain wall is not strongly dependent on these degrees of freedom .",
    "this is in accord to the results from the mean field analysis , if we assume that the properties of the domain walls are still governed by the trivial fixed point with @xmath193 .",
    "the difference between the spreading of a small active cluster and the behavior of an homogeneously active state indicates that the initial concentration of active sites plays a role .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",

    "i.e. , well in plateau regime . here",
    "we vary the initial concentration of active states by randomly distributing active sites through our lattice for @xmath198 .",
    "these activities are , respectively , @xmath199 and @xmath200 . for the latter two cases ,",

    "[ figac1 ] ) ; in the present case there is a typical activity in each system which rapidly disappears .",
    "we interpret this as further evidence that the nucleation of large holes dominates the eventual decay . for larger systems",
    "this effect disappears because the time it takes for a hole to engulf the whole system is large .",
    ", width=321 ]    the overall picture that emerges from our study is that the transition to spatio - temporal intermittency is strongly influenced by coherent ballistically traveling  solitons \" , which , even though they have a finite life - time , change the nature of the transition and can introduce first order like behavior .",
    "that such a scenario is relevant is supported by recent evidence for a discontinuous transition to spatio - temporal chaos in the damped kuramoto - sivashinsky equation @xcite , which is well - known to support localized ballistically moving excitations , or  pulses \" @xcite .",
    "we build our conclusions upon an extension , using two dimensional local maps , of the chat - manneville coupled map lattice .",
    "we thereby gain an additional parameter , which turns out to tune the importance and life - time of the solitons .",
    "for this coupled map lattice we find , depending on parameters , evidence for both continuous phase transitions in the universality class of directed percolation with infinitely many absorbing states and for first order behavior .",
    "to understand this behavior , we have developed a stochastic model generalizing the domany - kinzel cellular automaton . in this model ,",
    "the active sites can emit solitons and by colliding , the solitons can create new active sites .",
    "simulations of this model , together with the appropriate mean field theory , support the existence of both continuous and discontinuous transitions . with the stochastic model one can look at the behavior on much larger length and time scales .",
    "one thereby discovers that the active states close above the discontinuous transitions are actually metastable , and will finally decay when a sufficiently large droplet nucleates .",
    "such breakdown of first order behavior has been predicted by hinrichsen @xcite .",
    "we have not been able to pin down exactly how the nucleation time and eventual decay depends on system size , but it is not ruled out that the truly asymptotic behavior is still given by directed percolation in accordance with the predictions of hinrichsen .    even though the first order behavior is probably not truly asymptotic , it appears very clearly over a surprisingly long range of intermediate time scales , and would thus be relevant in the interpretation of experiments . we further show that this feature can lead to long power like transients displaying non - universal  critical exponents , \" and we believe that such transients are the origin of the observed non - universality in the transition to spatio - temporal intermittency .",
