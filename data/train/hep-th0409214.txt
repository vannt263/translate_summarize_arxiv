    "the critical behavior of a system with a single @xmath0-vector order parameter is well known @xcite . in this paper we investigate the critical behavior of a system with two @xmath0-vector parameters that is invariant under @xmath1 transformations and independent parity transformations .",
    "if the two @xmath0-vector order parameters are identical , i.e. the model is symmetric under their exchange , the most general landau - ginzburg - wilson ( lgw ) @xmath7 hamiltonian is given by @xmath8 , \\label{hcr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two @xmath0-dimensional vectors .",
    "this hamiltonian is well defined for @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hcr ] ) is invariant under the transformations @xmath14 the first @xmath15 group is related to the exchange transformations @xmath16 , while the second group is related to the parity transformations @xmath17 , @xmath18 , or , equivalently , @xmath19 , @xmath20 ( note that the transformation @xmath21 , @xmath22 is already accounted for by the @xmath1 group ) .",
    "if the two order parameters are not identical and therefore the symmetry is only @xmath23 the corresponding lgw @xmath7 hamiltonian is @xmath24 , \\label{hmcr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that is well defined for @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ hmcr ] ) has two different mass terms and thus it gives rise to a variety of critical and multicritical behaviors .",
    "it generalizes the multicritical hamiltonian considered in ref .",
    "@xcite that has @xmath29 and is symmetric under the larger symmetry group @xmath30 .    for @xmath3",
    "there is a transformation of the fields and couplings that leaves invariant hamiltonians ( [ hcr ] ) or ( [ hmcr ] ) .",
    "if we transform the fields as @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the couplings as @xmath33 we reobtain hamiltonians ( [ hcr ] ) and ( [ hmcr ] ) expressed in terms of the primed fields and couplings @xcite .",
    "this implies that , for any fp with @xmath34 , there exist an equivalent one with the same stability properties and @xmath35 .",
    "finally , if we do not require the invariance of the model under independent parity transformations , i.e. , the model is only @xmath1 symmetric , we must add an additional quadratic term @xmath36 and two additional quartic terms , @xmath37 and @xmath38 . in this case , the general analysis becomes more complex since we have to deal with a multicritical theory with three quadratic terms .    in this paper",
    "we investigate whether theories ( [ hcr ] ) and ( [ hmcr ] ) have stable fixed points ( fps ) in three dimensions .",
    "we do not determine the renormalization - group ( rg ) flow in the full theory , but rather we show that stable fps can be identified by an analysis of the submodels whose rg flow is already known .",
    "we consider the stable fps of the submodels and determine their stability properties with respect to the perturbations that are present in the complete theory . in this way we are able to identify three stable fps .",
    "for any @xmath0 , there is an @xmath2 symmetric fp",
    ". this fp may be the relevant one for models with @xmath39 , which may therefore show a symmetry enlargement at the ( multi)critical transition .",
    "for @xmath3 there is an equivalent @xmath40 symmetric fp with @xmath35 , a consequence of symmetry ( [ symmetry ] ) , which may be the relevant one for models with @xmath41 . for @xmath42 we find that @xmath43but not the multicritical theory @xmath44 has another stable fp that belongs to the so - called @xmath4 model @xcite with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "also in this case there is a symmetry enlargement at the transition : the fp is symmetric under the group @xmath5\\otimes c_2 $ ] where @xmath6 is the symmetry group of the square .",
    "it is interesting to note that the chiral @xmath2 fp is also stable if we do not require the model to be invariant under independent parity transformations .",
    "indeed , the additional terms @xmath47 and @xmath38 are irrelevant perturbations at the chiral fp .    in the analysis we mainly use the minimal - subtraction ( @xmath48 ) scheme without @xmath49 expansion ( henceforth indicated as @xmath50-@xmath48 scheme ) in which no @xmath49 expansion is performed and @xmath49 is set to the physical value @xmath51 @xcite . in order to generate the relevant perturbative series we use a symbolic manipulation program that generates the diagrams and computes symmetry and group factors . for the feynman integrals we use the results reported in ref",
