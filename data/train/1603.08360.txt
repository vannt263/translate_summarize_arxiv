    "in 1880 andrei a. markov , a 24-year old student from st petersburg , discovered in his master s thesis @xcite a remarkable connection between diophantine analysis and the following diophantine equation x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz , known nowadays as the _ markov equation . _ the solutions of this celebrated equation are known as _ markov triples _ and can be found from the obvious one @xmath6 by compositions of vieta involutions ( x , y , z ) ( x , y , 3xy - z ) and permutations of @xmath7 the result can be represented as the following _ markov tree _ ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .",
    "the numbers , which appear in markov triples , are called _ markov numbers _ , the set of which we denote by @xmath8 .",
    "their arithmetic was studied by frobenius @xcite , see recent development in @xcite . for more history and details",
    "we refer to the very nicely written book @xcite by aigner .",
    "the growth of markov numbers @xmath9 was studied by don zagier @xcite , who proved that asymptotically @xmath10 with some constant @xmath11 ( see also mcshane and rivin @xcite ) .    in our paper we study the growth of the numbers along each path _ as the function of the path _ on the markov tree .",
    "it is well - known that the paths of a binary planar tree are in one - to - one correspondence with points @xmath12 on a real projective line @xmath13 ( see next section for more detail ) .",
    "let @xmath14 be a path on the markov tree , considered as planar binary rooted tree ( see fig .",
    "2 ) .        let @xmath15 be the @xmath16-th markov number along the path @xmath14 and define the corresponding lyapunov exponent @xmath0 as ( x)=_n .",
    "equivalently , following @xcite one can consider the  tropical version \" of the markov tree : the euclid tree ( see fig.1 ) describing the euclidean algorithm with integer triples @xmath17 satisfying the relation u+v = w and define the _",
    "lyapunov exponent _ as ( x):=_n , where @xmath18 is the last ( largest ) number in the @xmath16-th triple along path @xmath19    to see the equivalence of these definitions one can consider ( following don zagier @xcite ) a modification of the markov equation given by x^2+y^2+z^2=3xyz+ , related to ( [ euclid ] ) by the simple change x = u , y = v , z = w .",
    "we prove that the lyapunov exponent exists for all paths and can be naturally extended to the function @xmath20 , which is @xmath21-_invariant _ : ( ) = ( x ) , x p^1 for all integer @xmath22 , satisfying @xmath23 ( see next section ) . in particular , for all rational @xmath24 the function @xmath25 it is clear that such function can not be continuous unless it is identically zero , which is not the case .",
    "the set @xmath26 of all possible values of @xmath0 is called the _ lyapunov spectrum _ of markov and euclid trees .",
    "the lyapunov spectrum of markov and euclid trees is spec_=[0 , ] , where @xmath27 is the golden ratio .    in particular , for all @xmath28",
    "@xmath29 so the  golden path \" has the maximal lyapunov exponent .    to state our second main result",
    "we need to introduce the following set of the  most irrational numbers \" @xmath30 recall that hurwitz @xcite proved that the golden ratio and its equivalents have the maximal possible markov constant , which can be considered a measure of irrationality ( see @xcite and section 4 below ) .",

    "since then this relation has been very much in use , see in particular , goldman @xcite , bowditch @xcite and a nice exposition by series @xcite .",
    "our general approach is close to chekhov and penner @xcite , who discussed similar questions in quantum theory of teichmller spaces .",
    "the key result for us is due to v. fock @xcite , who proved using thurston s laminations that a certain function defined in terms of markov numbers can be extended to a convex function on a real interval .",
    "we present also a generalisation of these results to the countable sets @xmath43 of quadratic irrationals depending on the natural number @xmath44 , such that for @xmath45 we have markov - hurwitz set @xmath46",

    "indeed , for every ( naturally oriented ) edge @xmath64 of @xmath57 we have two fractions @xmath65 , @xmath66 adjacent to it , so we can consider the matrix @xmath67 which belongs to @xmath47 .",
    "one can easily show that every matrix @xmath68 appears in this way exactly once .",
    "recall now that the _ spectral radius _ @xmath69 of a matrix @xmath70 is defined as the maximum of the modulus of its eigenvalues . for a non - triangular ( hyperbolic ) matrix @xmath70 from @xmath47",
    "the eigenvalues are @xmath71 , where @xmath72 and @xmath73 ( for triangular ( parabolic ) matrices @xmath74 ) .",

    "the left half of the tree is related by @xmath77 and by transposition of matrices ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "we see that the denominators of the fractions form the euclid tree shown on the right of the figure .",
    "let @xmath78 be the matrix assigned to @xmath16-th edge of @xmath14 .",
    "then @xmath79 is the corresponding sequence from the euclid tree .",
    "let @xmath80 be the maximal eigenvalue of @xmath81 . since @xmath82 with @xmath83 we have @xmath84 where we have used that @xmath85 , which is valid on this half of the tree .    to have the estimate of @xmath80 from below we need to consider the cases @xmath86 and @xmath87 separately .",
    "for @xmath86 @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 , so @xmath91 in this case .    if @xmath87 since @xmath92 as @xmath93 we have for large @xmath16 the inequality @xmath94 .",

    "recall that the _ norm _ of a matrix @xmath70 acting on a euclidean space is defined as @xmath99 the norm is related to the spectral radius by the formula @xmath100 and satisfies the inequalities ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath101 and @xmath102    now note that the matrices @xmath81 along a path @xmath14 have the product form @xmath103 where @xmath104 are either @xmath105 or @xmath106 defined as @xmath107 depending on whether we turn left or right on the tree .    since @xmath108 has maximal eigenvalue @xmath109 the norms @xmath110 therefore @xmath111 which implies that the sequence @xmath112 is bounded . in particular , @xmath113 exists and satisfies the inequality",
    "@xmath114    the equality is attained at @xmath115 since the corresponding @xmath116 similarly , for the very right path @xmath117 we have @xmath118 and thus @xmath119    to show that every value @xmath120 is attained we will use the following lemma .",

    "the second part follows from the equalities @xmath135 which are easy to check .",
    "now the strategy is the following : we can start with any matrix @xmath136 with @xmath137 and apply multiplication by @xmath138 from the right several times until we get to the matrix with spectral radius larger than @xmath139 as soon as this happens we start multiplying from the right by matrix @xmath106 until we have matrix with spectral radius less than @xmath140 and then repeat all this .",
    "it is easy to check that this process leads to a sequence of matrices @xmath141 such that @xmath142    let us extend @xmath143 to negative @xmath12 by @xmath144 and define @xmath145    the function @xmath146 is @xmath21-invariant : @xmath147 for all integer @xmath22 , satisfying @xmath148    indeed , it is well - known that two irrational numbers @xmath149 are @xmath21-equivalent , which means that @xmath150 if and only if @xmath12 and @xmath151 have continued fraction expansions which eventually coincide ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that the corresponding paths @xmath152 and @xmath153 have eventually the same sequence of left and right turns ( see sections 5 and 6 below ) , and by lemma 1 have the same lyapunov exponents .",
