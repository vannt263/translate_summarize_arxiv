    "complex networks have recently attracted a growing interest of scientists from different fields of research , mainly because complex networks define a powerful framework for describing , analyzing and modeling real systems that can be found in nature and/or society .",
    "this framework allows to conjugate the micro to the macro abstraction levels : nodes can be endowed with local dynamical rules , while the whole network can be though to be composed by hierarchies of clusters of nodes , that thus exhibits aggregated behavior .    the birth of graph theory is usually attributed to l. euler with his seminal paper concerning the knigsberg bridge problem(1736 ) , but it is only in the 50 s that network theory started to develop autonomously with the pioneering works of erds and rnyi  @xcite .",

    "free  @xcite , small ",
    "world  @xcite , communities  @xcite , just to mention few of them .    in a series of recent papers",
    "@xcite authors proposed a new point of view by constructing networks exhibiting scale - free structures following ideas taken from fractal construction , e.g. koch curve or sierpinski gasket .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to generalize these latter constructions and to define a unifying theory , hereby named _ weighted fractal networks _ ,",
    "wfn for short , whose networks share with fractal sets several interesting properties , for instance the self - similarity .",
    "the wfn are constructed via an explicit algorithm and we are able to completely analytically characterize their topology as a function of the parameters involved in the construction .",
    "we are thus able to prove that wfn exhibit the small  worldproperty , i.e. slow ( logarithmic ) increase of the average shortest path with the network size , and large average clustering coefficient .",
    "moreover the probability distribution of node strength follows a power law whose exponent is the hausdorff ( fractal ) dimension of the underlyingfractal , hence the wfn are scale  free .",
    "wfn also represent an explicitely computable model for the renormalization procedure recently applied to complex networks  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model and we outline the similarities with fractal sets . in section  [",
    "sect : result ] we present the analytical characterization of such networks also supported by dedicated numerical simulations .",
    "we then introduce in section  [ sec : nhwfn ] a straightforward generalization of the previous theory , and thus we conclude by showing a possible application of wfn to the study of fractal structures emerging in nature .",
    "according to mandelbrot  @xcite a fractal is by definition a set for which the hausdorff dimension strictly exceeds the topological dimension .",
    "one of the most amazing and interesting feature of fractals is their _ self - similarity _ , namely looking at all scales we can find conformal copies of the whole set . starting from this property one",
    "can provide rules to build up fractals as fixed point of _ iterated function systems _",
    "@xcite , ifs for short , whose hausdorff dimension is completely characterized by two main parameters , the number of copies @xmath0 and the scaling factor @xmath1 of the ifs .",
    "let us observe that in this case this dimension coincides with the so called similarity dimension  @xcite , @xmath2 .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to generalize such ideas to networks , aimed at constructing weighted complex networks   with some a priori prescribed topology , that will be described in terms of node strength distribution , average ( weighted ) shortest path and average ( weighted ) clustering coefficient , depending on the two main parameters : the number of copies and the scaling factor  .",
    "see also  @xcite where the wfn theory will be generalized as to include a stochastic iteration process . ] .",
    "moreover taking advantage of the similarity with the ifs fractals , some topological properties of the networks will depend on the fractal dimension of the ifs fractal .",
    "let us fix a positive real number @xmath3 and a positive integer @xmath4 and let us consider a ( possibly ) weighted network @xmath5 composed by @xmath6 nodes , one of which has been labeled _ attaching node _ and denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "we then define a map , @xmath8 , depending on the two parameters @xmath9 , @xmath10 and on the labeled node @xmath7 , whose action on networks is described in fig .",

    "thus the wfn undergo through a growth process strictly related to the inverse of the renormalization procedure  @xcite ; at the same time @xmath24 will be infinitely renormalizable .",
    "the aim of this section is to characterize the topology of the graphs @xmath23 for all @xmath26 and @xmath24 , by analytically studying their properties such as the average degree , the node strength distribution , the average ( weighted ) shortest path and the average ( weighted ) clustering coefficient .    at each iteration step",
    "the graph @xmath23 grows as the number of its nodes increases according to @xmath27 being @xmath28 the number of nodes in the initial graph , while the number of edges satisfies @xmath29 being @xmath30 the number of edges in the graph @xmath20 .",
