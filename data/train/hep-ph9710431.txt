    "the recent discoveries by the agasa@xcite , fly s eye@xcite , haverah park@xcite , and yakutsk@xcite collaborations of air shower events with energies above the greisen  zatsepin",
    " kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff of @xmath8 ev presents an outstanding puzzle in ultrahigh  energy cosmic  ray physics .",
    "it was anticipated that the highest  energy cosmic primaries would be protons from outside the galaxy , perhaps produced in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "it was also anticipated that the highest energies for protons arriving at earth would be @xmath8 ev@xcite .",
    "the origin of this gzk cutoff is degradation of the proton energy by the resonant scattering process @xmath9 when the proton is above the resonant threshold for @xmath10 production ; @xmath11 denotes a photon in the @xmath12 cosmic background radiation . for",
    "every mean free path @xmath13 mpc of travel , the proton loses 20% of its energy on average@xcite .",
    "a proton produced at its cosmic source with an initial energy @xmath14 will on average arrive at earth with only a fraction @xmath15 of its original energy .",
    "since agns are hundreds of megaparsecs away , the energy requirement at an agn source for a proton which arrives at earth with a super  gzk energy is unrealistically high@xcite . of course , proton energy is not lost significantly if the highest energy protons come from a rather nearby source , @xmath16 to 100 mpc@xcite .",
    "however , no agn sources are known to exist within 100 mpc of earth .",
    "hence , the observation of air shower events above @xmath5 ev challenges standard theory . in principle",
    ", there exists a check of the cutoff dynamics .",
    "the expected energy losses for protons above the cutoff should lead to an event pile  up at energies just below the cutoff@xcite .",
    "at present , the data is too sparse to rule in or out an event pile  up at @xmath8 ev .",
    "a primary nucleus mitigates the cutoff problem ( energy per nucleon is reduced by 1/a ) , but has additional problems : above @xmath17 ev nuclei should be photo  dissociated by the 2.7k background@xcite , and possibly disintegrated by the particle density ambient at the astrophysical source .",
    "rays and neutrinos are other possible primary candidates for the highest energy events . the gamma ",
    "ray hypothesis appears inconsistent with the time  development of the fly s eye event , but is not ruled out for this event@xcite .",
    "however , the mean free path for a @xmath18 ev photon to annihilate on the radio background to @xmath19 is believed to be only @xmath20 to @xmath21 mpc@xcite , and the density profile of the yakutsk event@xcite showed a large number of muons which may argue against gamma  ray initiation .",
    "concerning the neutrino hypothesis , the fly s eye event occured high in the atmosphere , whereas the expected event rate for early development of a neutrino  induced air shower is down from that of an electromagnetic or hadronic interaction by six orders of magnitude@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "there is good evidence that some of the highest  energy primaries have common arrival directions , with arrival times displaced by @xmath22  s. such event  pairing argues for a common source of some duration emitting stable neutral primaries@xcite .",
    "neutrino primaries satisfy this criterion .",
    "charged  particle primaries should display bending in cosmic magnetic fields , leading to an energy ",
    "dependent divergence in arrival directions and arrival times .",
    "some exotic particles@xcite and exotic dynamics@xcite have been introduced in an attempt to circumvent the problems of conventional primaries and conventional interactions , and thereby accommodate the highest energy events . however ,",
    "most of the new proposals come with their own peculiar difficulties@xcite , so new ideas are still welcomed .",
    "the purpose of this article is to revisit a neutrino  annihilation mechanism which may produce photons and baryons with with energies above the gzk cutoff , and to calculate the number of photons and nucleons which would arrive at earth with super ",
    "gzk energies and interact in our atmosphere . in 1982 it was shown@xcite that the annihilation channel of cosmic  ray neutrinos on relic neutrinos should produce an absorption dip in the high  energy cosmic neutrino flux if the target neutrinos , the relics predicted by hot big bang cosmology , have a mass large compared to their relic temperature @xmath23 ev .",
    "scattering of an ultrahigh energy neutrino on the nonrelativistic relic neutrino background resonantly produces a @xmath3boson at the energy @xmath24 ev ( @xmath25 labels the three light neutrino types ) .",
    "the width of the resonant energy for annihilation is @xmath26 .",
    "the annihilation process converts neutrinos with energy within 0.03 of the peak resonant energy @xmath27 into highly energetic @xmath3bosons .",
    "the @xmath3 produced in each neutrino annihilation immediately decays ( its lifetime is @xmath28 in its rest frame ) .",
    "70% of the @xmath3 decays are hadronic , with a final state known to include on average fifteen neutral pions and 1.35 baryon ",
    "antibaryon pairs@xcite .",
    "the fifteen @xmath29 s decay to produce thirty high  energy photons .",
    "the @xmath3 is highly boosted , with @xmath30 for super  gzk energies .",
    "consequently , its decay products are relativistically beamed into a cone of half ",
    ". we will refer to the collimated high  energy end product of this @xmath3 production and hadronic decay as a `` @xmath3burst . ''",
    "if the @xmath3burst points in the direction of earth and occurs close enough to earth so that the nucleons may propagate to earth without too much energy attenuation , or the photons without too much absorption , then one or more of the photons and nucleons in the burst may initiate a super  gzk air shower at earth , as illustrated in fig . 1",
    "let us call the distance over which a stable particle can propagate without losing more than an order of magnitude of its energy the gzk distance .",
    "for a photon it is 10 to 40 mpc , with the exact number depending on the strengths of the diffuse radio and infrared background . for a proton",
    "it is @xmath32\\times 6 $ ] mpc @xmath0 50 to 100 mpc .",
    "we seek the probability for resonant annihilation of a cosmic ray @xmath33 and a relic @xmath34 ( or vice versa ) into the @xmath3boson , within the gzk distance of earth ( the `` gzk zone '' ) .",
    "the rate of @xmath3burst production within the gzk zone will be greatly enhanced if the relic neutrinos cluster in the potential wells within the gzk zone@xcite , which includes the wells of the local supercluster , the local group of galaxies , and of course , our own galaxy .",
    "some clustering is expected if the relic neutrinos are nonrelativistic , with mass considerably above their temperature , @xmath35 ev .    the mean energy per hadron from a @xmath3burst will be about 40 times less than @xmath27 , since the mean multiplicity in @xmath3 decay is about 40 @xcite .",
    "although the energy per particle is diluted , the thirty photons from @xmath29decays and the 2.7 baryons in the final state serve to amplify the propagating particle flux above the gzk cutoff by a factor of @xmath36 .",
    "we will soon argue that the mean energy per baryon is about ten times larger than the mean energy per photon .",
    "two crucial elements are required for this mechanism to produce super  gzk air showers .",
    "they are : +",
    "( i ) the existence of a neutrino flux at @xmath37 ev , and + ( ii ) the existence of a neutrino mass in the 0.1 to 10 ev range . +",
    "a third ingredient greatly enhances the rate for observed s. it is : + ( iii ) a significant clustering of the relic neutrino density within the gzk zone , e.g. in the potential wells of our supergalactic cluster , galactic cluster , or possibly even our galactic halo .",
    "+ we discuss the plausibility of each of these ingredients in turn .",
    "the observations of the highest  energy cosmic rays tell us that some primaries are produced at @xmath7 ev or more .",
    "the actual energies of particles at their sources may well be higher than @xmath7 ev , since particles may lose energy while emerging from the high  density environment of the source , and , as noted earlier , nucleons lose energy by scattering on the 2.7k photon background .",
    "it is likely that whatever mechanism produces these most energetic particles also produces charged pions of comparable energy .",
    "thus , one may expect neutrino production at ultrahigh energy , coming from pion decay and subsequent muon decay@xcite .",
    "the much smaller opacity for neutrinos as compared to protons in dense sources such as agns makes credible the possibility of a neutrino flux considerably above the proton flux at highest energies .",
    "the mean relic neutrino density of the universe is predicted by hot big bang cosmology .",
    "the density of relic neutrinos with mass below an mev ( the neutrino decoupling temperature ) is given by a relativistic fermi - dirac distribution characterized by a single temperature parameter .",
    "the distribution is that of relativisitic neutrinos , even though the neutrinos are nonrelativistic today , because the distribution is determined at the decoupling epoch . as a result of photon reheating from the era of @xmath38 annihilation , the neutrino temperature @xmath39k is predicted to be a factor of @xmath40 less than that of the photon temperature , @xmath41k .",
    "the resulting mean neutrino number density is @xmath42 for each light flavor @xmath25 with an equal number density for each antineutrino flavor .",
    "note that the predicted relic neutrino density is normalized via the temperature relation to the relic photon density which is measured .",
    "consequently , the predicted mean density of @xmath43 must be considered firm .",
    "the mean energy density in neutrinos is obtained by multiplying together mass and mean density and summing over light flavors .",
    "the result , as a fraction of the closure density , is @xmath44 ev ) , with @xmath45 being the present value of the hubble parameter @xmath46 in units of 100 km / s / mpc .",
    "the observational constraint on the hubble parameter gives @xmath47 , with lower values in the range favored .",
    "one sees that a neutrino mass , or a sum of neutrino masses , up to tens of ev is consistent with hot big bang cosmology .",
    "perhaps more importantly , one sees that a neutrino mass around or above an ev is required if neutrino hot dark matter is to contribute in any significant way to the evolution of large  scale structures .",
    "some have argued that the existence of the largest observed structures necessitates the existence of hot dark matter@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the simplest explanation for the anomalous atmospheric  neutrino flavor ",
    "ratio@xcite is neutrino oscillations driven by a mass  squared difference of @xmath48 @xcite , which implies a mass of at least 0.1 ev .",
    "the recent lsnd measurement is claimed@xcite to also indicate a neutrino mass , of order 1  ev .      some nonrelativistic matter ,",
    "whether charged or neutral , is expected to have fallen into gravitational potential wells and `` cooled '' . for charged matter",
    "the energy loss mechanism is dominantly bremsstrahlung during two  body scattering . for neutral ( `` dissipationless '' ) matter ,",
    "the mechanism ( termed `` violent relaxation '' ) is many ",
    "body gravitational scattering wherein some particles gain energy at the expense of other particles as a consequence of the time  varying gravitational potential@xcite .",
    "examples of collapse and capture of dissipationless matter are seen in models of gravitational infall@xcite .",
    "a consequence of clustering for massive neutrinos is that the mean free path for annihilation is much shorter in large ",
    "scale potential wells , and the efficiency for neutrino to hadron conversion is accordingly much higher . let us determine the scaling law that governs the increase in annihilation rate when neutrinos are clustered rather than distributed uniformly throughout the universe .",
    "density scales with clustering length @xmath49 and the number of cluster sites @xmath50 within the volume of the visible universe @xmath51 as @xmath52 . the path length across the neutrino cluster scales as @xmath53 .",
    "putting the factors together , and estimating @xmath54 with @xmath55 , the annihilation rate for a neutrino cosmic ray traversing the cluster therefore scales as @xmath56 .",
    "it is useful to write @xmath57 to define the mean distance @xmath58 between neighboring cluster sites . then , @xmath50 may be eliminated to yield the final form @xmath59 of the geometrical scaling factor for annihilation within a cluster of size @xmath49 and mean separation @xmath58 .",
    "if the neutrino clustering scale is less than the gzk distance of 50 to 100 mpc , then the @xmath3burst production rate within the gzk zone also scales with the same @xmath59 law.an average over all cosmic ray trajectories would show no enhanced annihilation rate .",
    "the fraction of rays that intersect any relic halo varies as @xmath60 with clustering , to compensate the @xmath61 increase in annihilations within the halos .",
    "the fact that an earthbound observer sees only the @xmath61 enhancement factor is due to our `` preferred '' vantage point within or nearby a neutrino cluster .",
    "we will implement this scaling law shortly .",
    "for neutrinos with the standard weak interaction , there is little hindrance to their propagation over cosmic distances except for nonzero mass neutrinos with energy near the resonant energy on the @xmath3pole@xcite .",
    "the annihilation cross section @xmath62 is first order in the fermi constant @xmath63 , whereas neutrino scattering cross sections are order @xmath64 .",
    "the relatively large cross section of the resonant process is somewhat mitigated by the narrowness of the @xmath3 pole ( 2.5 gev is the width ) since it is the energy ",
    "integrated cross sections which determine the annihilation rate of a flux distributed in energy .",
    "the resonant contribution should dominate the energy ",
    "integrated order @xmath64 scattering cross sections in the energy region of interest , particularly if the neutrino flux has a falling spectrum above @xmath65 . in any case , non  resonant scattering contributions can only add to the resonantly produced super ",
    "gzk flux we calculate here .",
    "define the invariant , energy  averaged annihilation cross section by the following integral over the @xmath3 pole : @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the square of the energy in the center of momentum frame .",
    "the standard model value for this cross section is @xmath68 for each neutrino type ( flavor or mass basis ) , independent of any neutrino mixing ",
    "angles since the annihilation mechanism is a neutral current process .",
    "the energy of the neutrino annihilating at the peak of the @xmath3pole is @xmath24  ev . for a given resonant energy @xmath27 , only neutrinos with the @xmath69 mass @xmath70 may annihilate .",
    "the energy  averaged annihilation cross section @xmath71 is the effective cross section for all neutrinos within @xmath72 of their peak annihilation energy .",
    "( we will sometimes use @xmath65 generically for resonant energy , as we do here , with the understanding that there are really three different resonant energies , one for each neutrino mass . )",
    "we will refer to neutrinos with resonant flavor @xmath25 and with energy in the resonant range 0.97 @xmath27 to 1.03 @xmath27 as `` resonant neutrinos . ''      in a universe where the neutrinos are nonrelativistic but unclustered the mean annihilation length for neutrinos at their resonant energy would be @xmath73  cm .",
    "a cosmic ray neutrino arriving at earth from a cosmically distant source will have traversed approximately a hubble distance of space , @xmath74 cm . in an unclustered relic neutrino sea",
    "the annihilation probability for such a neutrino at its resonant energy is @xmath75 .",
    "for each 50 mpc of travel through the mean neutrino density , the probability for a neutrino with resonant energy to annihilate to a @xmath3boson is @xmath76 .",
    "the branching fraction for a @xmath3 to decay to hadrons is 70% .",
    "consequently , one part in 4000 of the resonant neutrino flux will be converted into a @xmath3burst containing ultrahigh energy photons and nucleons within the 50 mpc gzk ",
    "zone of earth in this unclustered universe .",
    "this value of @xmath77 for the probability of a resonant neutrino creating a @xmath3burst within the gzk zone is the in a big bang universe .      with `` local '' clustering of the relic neutrinos ,",
    "the probability for annihilation within the gzk zone is significantly enhanced .",
    "the probability is given by that found for a hubble distance of travel in a non  clustered universe , scaled by the geometric factor of sec .",
    "the resulting annihilation probability is @xmath78 , for a cluster of size @xmath49 and mean cluster ",
    "cluster separation distance @xmath58 .",
    "let us define some fiducial values for cluster sizes and mean cluster  to ",
    "cluster distances.we realize that a cluster or halo size is not well defined , but it is useful to pretend that they are for purposes of illustrating the annihilation enhancement expected from neutrino clustering .",
    "we will see shortly that in fact it is the integrated column density of relic neutrinos that determines the annihilation rate .",
    "our use of constant densities within well  defined cluster radii may be easily translated into column densities .",
    "we take @xmath79 mpc for the diameter of the virgo supercluster , the only supercluster well within our gzk zone , distances from earth to the centers of the nearest rich clusters are estimated in @xcite to be 11 , 40 , 50 , and 60 @xmath80 mpc for virgo , pisces , perseus , and coma , respectively . and 100 mpc , typical of the distance across a cosmic void , for the supercluster mean separation distance @xmath81 .",
    "we take @xmath82 mpc for the typical diameter of galactic clusters and @xmath83 mpc as the typical distance between neighboring galactic clusters . for our local group of @xmath84 galaxies , we take @xmath85 mpc , and @xmath86 mpc for the mean separation distance between groups .",
    "@xmath87 kpc is a typical diameter of galactic halos ( including our own ) and @xmath88 mpc is a typical distance between neighboring galaxies . with these fiducial values for sizes and separation distances , the respective density enhancements @xmath89 are of order 100 , @xmath90 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , for the supercluster , cluster , local group , and galactic halo , assuming that neutrino clustering is more or less as efficient as baryonic clustering for these scales .",
    "the annihilation ",
    "probability geometric factors are @xmath92 , 1.7 , 0.7 , and 0.14  @xmath45 , respectively , for neutrino clustering on the scales of the supercluster , cluster , local group , and galactic halo , again assuming efficient neutrino clustering . including the 70% hadronic branching ratio of the @xmath3",
    ", one then gets the probabilities 1.3% , 2.4% , 1.0% , and 0.2% ( independent of @xmath45 ) , for @xmath3burst production by a neutrino of relevant flavor at resonant energy traversing the supercluster , cluster , local group , and galactic halo , respectively .",
    "clustering on the small scale of the galactic halo gives the smallest probability .",
    "the larger clusters all give a robust probability , within a factor of two of each other , and of order of a per cent .",
    "this is our main result , which we repeat for emphasis : _ the probability for cosmic ray neutrinos at their resonant energy to annihilate within the @xmath93  mpc zone of earth is likely within an order of magnitude of 1% , with the exact value depending on unknown aspects of neutrino mixing and relic neutrino clustering .",
    "_    we have assumed here that the neutrino cluster is local , in that it contains our earth . in this case the scaling law and the enhanced probability applies for the full sky of cosmic rays . a `` non  local '' cluster will also yield this enhanced probability , but only for cosmic rays with arrival directions within the solid angle of the distant cluster .",
    "a detailed calculation of the @xmath3burst rate , including the possibility of anisotropic neutrino clustering , will be presented in the next two subsections .",
    "the ( in)efficiency of neutrino clustering warrants our attention .",
    "one expects the relic neutrinos to be less clustered than the baryons , especially on scales as small as the galactic halo , for several reasons .",
    "first of all , neutrinos do not dissipate energy as easily as electrically charged protons do .",
    "secondly , neutrinos have a much larger jeans ( `` free  streaming '' ) length than do baryons at the crucial time when galaxies start to grow nonlinearly . and thirdly , pauli blocking presents a significant barrier to clustering of light  mass fermions@xcite . as a crude estimate of pauli blocking",
    ", one may use the zero temperature fermi gas as a model of the gravitationally bound halo neutrinos . requiring that the fermi momentum of the neutrinos not exceed the virial velocity @xmath94 within the cluster",
    ", one gets @xmath95 .",
    "the virial velocity within our galaxy is a couple hundred km / sec , whereas virial velocities for rich galactic clusters are a thousand km / s or more .",
    "thus it appears that pauli blocking allows significant clustering on the galactic scale only if @xmath96  ev , but allows clustering on the larger scales for @xmath97  ev . the free  streaming argument also favors clustering on the larger scales.an anonymous referee mentioned yet another potential obstacle to the clustering of neutrinos on the galactic scale .",
    "it is that the thermal velocity of relic neutrinos is comparable to the virial or escape velocity if @xmath98  ev .",
    "this result is obtained by noting that it is the neutrino s momentum which has red  shifted since decoupling , leading to @xmath99 , which implies @xmath100 .",
    "this is just as well , for we have shown that it is the larger scales of clustering that give the @xmath101 probability for annihilation to a @xmath3burst .      the rate calculation may be carried out more carefully .",
    "let @xmath102 denote the flux of the @xmath103 neutrino flavor , as would be measured at a distance @xmath104 from the source , with energy within @xmath105 of @xmath106 .",
    "the units of @xmath102 are neutrinos / energy / area / time / solid angle",
    ". this flux may be quasi ",
    "isotropic ( `` diffuse '' ) , as might arise from a sum over cosmically ",
    "distant sources such as agns ; or it may be highly directional , perhaps pointing back to sources within our supergalactic plane .",
    "the distinction between diffuse and discrete fluxes affects the arrival direction of the super  gzk events , but not the rate calculation .",
    "the change in the neutrino flux due to resonant annihilation is @xmath107 , where the mean annihilation length is @xmath108^{-1}$ ] as before .",
    "@xmath109 is therefore the production rate per unit length of @xmath3 s with energy within @xmath105 of @xmath106 , per unit area and unit solid angle .",
    "integrating the absorption equation over the distance @xmath110 from the emission site to earth gives the depletion in the neutrino flux at energy @xmath106 : f__j(e_,d ) = f__j(e_,0 ) , [ enabs ] with @xmath111 .",
    "the relic neutrino column density is defined as s(d)^d_0 dx n__j(x ) .",

    "[ abs ] for a narrow resonance the flux may be evaluated at the resonant energy and removed from the integral .",
    "the remaining integral may be made an invariant by using @xmath112 to write f__j(d)= e_r f__j(e_r,0 ) .",
    "[ abs3 ] contact is made with our earlier estimate if @xmath113 is small compared to one .",
    "then it is sufficient to keep the first nonzero term in the taylor series of the bracketed factor .",

    "for @xmath115 , the attenuation of the neutrino flux over the distance from the source to the gzk zone will be small , and we may set @xmath110 in eqn .",
    "( [ inv ] ) equal to the gzk distance to get the @xmath3burst rate within the gzk zone .",
    "if the neutrino cluster is not isotropic with respect to our preferred position at earth , the @xmath3burst rate will not be isotropic either . the anisotropic rate is easily accounted for by generalizing the distance @xmath110 to be vector @xmath116 . the column density integral in eqn .",
    "( [ colmdensity ] ) then becomes an integral of @xmath117 along the vector @xmath116 .",
    "there is weak evidence that the super  gzk events may correlate with the supergalactic plane@xcite .",
    "such a correlation would arise naturally in the model presented here if the sg plane provided either the super  gzk neutrino flux or the potential well in which neutrinos are clustered ( or both ) .",
    "it is possible , in fact it is probable , that massive neutrinos exhibit mixing in analogy to the quark sector of the standard model of particle physics . in the mixed case ,",
    "the flavor states are unitary mixtures of the mass states . letting @xmath118 label flavor and @xmath119 label mass",
    ", one writes @xmath120 .",
    "then each neutrino flavor at the resonant energy of a given mass state has a nonzero probability to annihilate , but with an extra probability factor of @xmath121 .",
    "for example , the @xmath122 s and @xmath123 s from pion and mu decay will annihilate at the resonant energy of @xmath124 with the probability factors @xmath125 and @xmath126 , respectively , times what we have calculated above.the phenomenon of neutrino oscillations will occur when neutrinos are mixed , and it will affect the flavor populations of the cosmic  ray neutrinos .",
    "however , it will not affect the calculation of annihilation , because the @xmath127 annhilation process requires just a single transformation from flavor to mass basis , so the phase differences induced between mass states are not observed .",
    "we remark that if the lepton mixing mirrored the known mixing among the quarks , then the heaviest of the three neutrino mass states should be mainly mixed with the third generation @xmath128 .",
    "if this were the case , then @xmath129 and @xmath130 would be small , and annihilation with a significant probability at the lowest resonant",
    " energy @xmath131 would arise only if there were a substantial @xmath128 flux ( of unspecified origin).if @xmath132 and @xmath133 are small , then the vacuum oscillation probabilities for @xmath134 and @xmath135 are also small .",
    "however , recent data from the superkamiokande collaboration validates earlier evidence that the @xmath128 and @xmath136 may be near  maximally mixed ( see `` note added '' at the paper s end ) , in which case significant @xmath122 annihilation on @xmath137 is expected .",
    "we have calculated annihilation probabilities assuming no mixing . without mixing , each flavor",
    " type has a unique mass , and the resonant energy of each neutrino flavor is unique . if there is mixing , the factors @xmath121 can be easily multiplied in .",
    "in addition to the flavor  mixing issue , another subtley arises if the massive neutrinos are of dirac  type as opposed to majorana  type .",
    "as the universe expanded and the momenta of the relic neutrinos red  shifted , they evolved to the unpolarized nonrelativistic state which they occupy today . as a result , if the neutrino is a dirac particle , then the sterile right  handed neutrino and the sterile left  handed antineutrino fields are populated equally with the two active fields .",
    "therefore , for dirac neutrinos the active densities available for annihilation with the incident high energy neutrino are half of the total densities , and the @xmath3burst production probability is half of what we quote in this article . in contrast , for majorana neutrinos there are no sterile fields and the total densities are active in annihilation .",
    "majorana neutrinos are favored over dirac neutrinos in currently popular theoretical models with nonzero neutrino mass@xcite .",
    "having argued that cosmic neutrino / relic neutrino annihilation in our galactic halo is a possible candidate for @xmath3burst events , let us study more closely the particle spectrum contained in the burst .",

    "the energy of the six @xmath29 s produced through resonance decays may be softer yet . weighting the direct and secondary pions appropriately then ( we take the latter to be softer by @xmath145 ) , we arrive at a factor of about six for the softness of the mean pion energy compared to the mean nucleon energy . since the photon on average carries half of the parent pion energy , the mean energy of the @xmath29decay photons in a @xmath3burst is expected to be less than that of the nucleons by an order of magnitude .",

    "each of the four leptons from the decay chain carries on average a quarter of the charged pion s energy .",
    "the produced neutrinos are below the original resonant energy of their parent cosmic ray neutrino , so they are not relevant for our purposes of creating and identifying super ",

    "the boost factors for the s are @xmath154 .",
    "when a photon with incident energy @xmath155 and incident angle @xmath156 with respect to the  velocity is scattered through an angle @xmath157 , the final photon energy as a fraction of the incident  energy is @xmath158 .",

    "there are a few more remarks that should be made concerning the hypothesis under discussion : + ( i ) a common problem that arises when trying to explain the super  gzk air showers with new physics concerns the smoothness of the event rate as a function of energy . both the event rate and the event energy above the gzk cutoff follow extrapolations from below the cutoff .",
    "smooth extrapolations are not necessarily expected when new physics is invoked to explain the super  gzk events .",
    "the proposal in this article makes use of standard model particles and interactions only , and so is not automatically subject to this criticism .",
    "if the product of the super  gzk neutrino flux per flavor , times the annihilation probability within the gzk zone ( which we have estimated to be @xmath204 ) , times the photon and nucleon multiplicity per burst ( @xmath36 ) , is comparable to the highest  energy proton flux , then a smooth extrapolation in event rates results .",
    "such an occurrence does not seem unnatural . + ( ii ) to be more quantitative , the observed rate of super  gzk events can be used to predict the cosmic neutrino flux at the resonant energy , within the context of the neutrino  annihilation hypothesis .",
    "let @xmath205 be the luminosity of super  gzk events ( in units of events / area / time / solid angle ) .",
    "the relation between this event luminosity and the neutrino flux is @xmath206 , which implies @xmath207 . because the high energy cross  section is several orders of magnitude below the hadronic cross ",
    "section at these energies , this neutrino flux is not directly measureable in any neutrino detectors presently under development .",
    "+ ( iii ) the highest  energy neutrino cosmic  ray flux should point back to its sources of origin , and the super  gzk event arrival directions should point back to these same sources . however , if the highest  energy neutrino flux is diffuse , then the super  gzk event directions should correlate with the spatial distribution of the relic neutrino density . the solid angles subtended by any nearby halos may offer preferred directions for super  gzk events . as discussed in the earlier section on neutrino clustering , the supergalactic plane may be the most probable cluster domain .",
    "perhaps the angular distribution of super  gzk events can be used to perform neutrino  cluster tomography .",
    "( we remark that significant flattening of dark halos is suggested by observation@xcite and by numerical simulations@xcite , and that a flattened halo implies a larger number density by a factor of the axes ratio . ) + ( iv ) if the super  gzk events are due to neutrino annihilation on relics as hypothesized here , and if the high  energy neutrino flux is eventually measured , then an estimate of the relic neutrino column density out to @xmath208 mpc may be made : the column density of the annihilating neutrino flavor out to @xmath209 is @xmath210 = 4.5\\times 10^{32 } { \\cal l}(>e_{{\\rm gzk}})/   [ e_r f_{\\nu_j}(e_r)]\\,{{\\rm cm}}^{-2}$ ] .",
    "if @xmath211 is measured below the resonant energy , an estimate of the neutrino column density can still be made by extrapolating the flux to @xmath65 .",
    "for example , if a power law is assumed with a spectral index @xmath157 , then @xmath212 .",
    "+ ( v ) if the cosmic sources of the highest  energy neutrino fluxes are themselves located in potential wells containing bound relic neutrinos , then the neutrinos produced at the resonant energy may well annihilate on the relic neutrinos in the source halo . in such a case , a depleted flux of resonant energy neutrinos would emerge from the source . however , the recessional velocity due to the hubble flow will red  shift neutrinos with energies just above the resonant value at the source to the resonant energy in our vicinity .",
    "any source with cosmological red ",
    "shift @xmath213 above @xmath214 ( 0.03 ) will provide our galaxy with a full ( half ) flux of neutrinos at the resonant energy .",
    "if the spectrum of neutrinos from a single source can be measured , one might see the depletion at @xmath65 due to absorption in our halo , and a depletion at @xmath215 due to absorption in the source halo .",
    "in summary , if one or more neutrino mass is of order 0.1 to 1 ev , and if there is a sufficient flux of cosmic ray neutrinos at @xmath37 ev , then @xmath216 ( or vice versa ) @xmath217 and @xmath218 in our supergalactic cluster , local group , or galactic halo may be the origin of air shower events above the gzk cutoff .",
    "an abundant number of possible signatures to validate or invalidate this hypothesis were presented in this work .",
    "the weakest link in the hypothesis is probably the large neutrino flux required at the resonant energy , well above the gzk cutoff .",
    "such a flux severely challenges conventional source models in two ways : first of all , source dynamics must be able to produce the neutrino flux above @xmath7  ev , and secondly , any concomitant photon flux must not violate existing upper limits .",
    "the super  gzk photon flux produced in non  local @xmath3bursts is also a potential liability , for it will cascade down to produce an abundance of gamma  rays which must not violate existing upper bounds .",
    "a logical next step toward validating or invalidating the hypothesis is a numerical simulation of the details of the model@xcite .",
