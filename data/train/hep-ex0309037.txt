    "the diffractive structure function of the proton has been measured in inclusive diffractive deep - inelastic @xmath0 scattering ( ddis ) by the h1 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "the data are compatible with the decomposition of the structure function into a flux factor and the structure function of a colourless exchange ( pomeron ) . in dglap fits ,",
    "leading order ( lo ) and next - to - leading order pomeron parton densities ( ppdfs ) have been extracted and found to be dominated by the gluon distribution  @xcite .",
    "it has been proven within qcd  @xcite that in ddis the cross section can be written as a convolution of the diffractive parton densities of the proton with the hard parton - photon cross section .",
    "diffractive dijet and d@xmath1 meson ( heavy quark ) production are directly sensitive to the dominant diffractive gluon through the boson gluon fusion production mechanism ( fig .",

    "the data are compared to the lo predictions of the monte carlo program rapgap  @xcite .",
    "higher - order effects are modelled by using parton showers .",
    "the predictions are based on the pomeron model  @xcite with flux factor and lo ppdfs as extracted in inclusive ddis .",
    "the ppdfs from the ` h1 fit 2 '  @xcite and the new ` h1 2002 fit '  @xcite to more precise data are used .",

    "the new ` h1 2002 fit ' based prediction describes the data well .",
    "the ` h1 fit 2 ' predicts a @xmath1425% larger rate .",

    "the ` h1 fit 2 ' prediction overestimates the normalisation of the data by a factor @xmath141.4 . the difference of the predictions is of the order of the uncertainty arising from that of the gluon distribution .",

    "the factor is independent of the ppdfs used .",
    "the suppression is not significant at the present level of precision and there is no evidence that it differs between direct and resolved photon processes .",
    "in diffractive dis , measured dijet and d@xmath1 production cross sections are in agreement with predictions which rely on qcd factorisation . for diffractive dijet photoproduction , an overall suppression factor relative to dis of 1.3@xmath260.3 ( exp . )",

    "the diffractive @xmath7 dijet cross sections are compatible with the predictions within the relatively large uncertainties of the data .",
