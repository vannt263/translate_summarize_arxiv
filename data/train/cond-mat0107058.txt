    "the theoretical and experimental interest in thermoelectric power in bulk and recent low dimensional systems has been intensified@xcite-@xcite . a relatively long survey of literature and some common misunderstandings in the field of thermoelectric power ( @xmath0 ) and nernst - ettingshausen ( ne ) effect under different transport conditions@xcite,@xcite-@xcite are given in our recent paper@xcite .    lei@xcite showed in 1994 that the diffusion component of   @xmath0   may be negative at a low lattice temperature range and high electric field while the phonon drag component is still positive .",
    "such a result was also obtained by babaev and gassymov@xcite in 1977 .",
    "they theoretically investigated the ne effect and   @xmath0   in semiconductors at high electric and nonquantizing magnetic fields by solving the coupled system of kinetic equations for electrons and phonons .",
    "the electron and phonon heating , and the phonon drag were taken into account .",
    "it was shown that when the temperature gradient of hot electrons is produced only by the lattice temperature gradient , the electronic parts of the thermoelectric and ne fields reverse their sign . in the case of phonon heating and   @xmath1 , both electronic and phonon parts of the thermoelectric and thermomagnetic fields",
    "reverse their sign for all cases considered . here",
    "@xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4   are the temperature of electrons , phonons and lattice , respectively .",
    "the ne effect and @xmath0 in ii - vi semiconductors have been investigated with increasing interest@xcite-@xcite .",
    "the earlier investigations of the magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) dependence of the longitudinal ne effect in hgse@xcite and lead chalcogenides@xcite in the region of higher temperatures ( @xmath6 ) demonstrated that the thermoelectromotive force exhibits saturation in the region of strong magnetic fields irrespective of the dominant scattering mechanism of charge carriers in the conduction band .",
    "however , the longitudinal ne effect in iron - doped hgse samples at low temperatures ( @xmath7 ) has a maxima in the plot of @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 first increases quadratically with increasing @xmath5 for @xmath10 then passes through a maximum at @xmath11 , and finally decreases as the field increases further ( here @xmath12 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath13 is the electron relaxation time ) .",
    "another unusual fact is the sign reversal of the transverse ne coefficient @xmath14 with increasing @xmath5 in the range @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the experiments in gallium - doped hgse revealed that at low temperatures the ne coefficients change sign with increasing gallium concentration or the applied magnetic field strength .",
    "these unusual features of the ne effect may be attributed to the effect of mutual drag which can be observed in semiconductors with high concentration of conduction electrons@xcite .    in the absence of external magnetic field ,",

    "gurevich and mashkevich list the procedure for determining the distribution function of electrons .",
    "however , the list is not complete . because , they obtain only the general expressions for electric current and electron and phonon parts of thermal fluxes , but they did not find the external electric field dependence of the effective electron and phonon temperatures .",
    "therefore , they did not find the thermoelectric coefficients and their external electric field dependence .    in the present paper ,",
    "the ne effect and @xmath0 in degenerate semiconductors and semimetals placed in high external electric , and longitudinal and transverse magnetic fields are investigated by taking into account the heating of electrons and phonons as well as the thermal and mutual drags of charge carriers and phonons .",
