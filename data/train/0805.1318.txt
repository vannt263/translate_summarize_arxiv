    "entanglement is considered to be the key resource of the rapidly developing fields of quantum information processing and quantum computation , for an introduction see e.g.  @xcite . among the early proposals concerning the applications of entangled states",
    "are those for quantum key distribution  @xcite , quantum dense coding  @xcite , and quantum teleportation  @xcite . despite the resulting great interest in entangled quantum states ,",
    "their complete characterization is still an unsolved problem .",
    "it is known that entanglement can be fully identified by applying all positive but not completely positive ( pncp ) maps to a given state  @xcite .",
    "the problem of this approach , however , consists in the fact that the general form of the pncp maps is essentially unknown . the presently best studied pncp map is the partial transposition ( pt )  @xcite .",
    "it is known that pt gives a complete characterization of entanglement in hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath0 and @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "bipartite entanglement can also be completely characterized via pt in infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces , as long as only gaussian states are considered , whose moments up to second order fully describe their properties  @xcite . by using higher - order moments ,",
    "a complete characterization has been given for those entangled states which exhibit negativities after application of the pt map  @xcite .",
    "this approach gives no insight into bound entangled states remaining positive after pt .",
    "to overcome this limitation , to the matrices of moments other kinds of pcnp maps have been applied  @xcite , including kossakowsky , choi and breuer maps  @xcite .",
    "the identification of bound entanglement in this way , however , turned out to be a cumbersome problem",
    ".    an equivalent approach of identifying entanglement is based on special types of hermitian operators , called entanglement witnesses .",
    "the witnesses were introduced as a class of linear operators , whose mean values are non - negative for separable states but can become negative for entangled states  @xcite .",
    "presently only some classes of entanglement witnesses are available .",
    "once a witness is known , an optimization can be performed  @xcite .",
    "also nonlinear witnesses have been studied  @xcite , which may increase the number of entangled states to be identified by a single witness , in comparison with a given linear witness . however ,",
    "if one is able to construct the general form of the linear witnesses , the problem of identifying entanglement is completely solved .    in the present contribution",
    "we show that any entanglement witness can be expressed in terms of completely positive hermitian operators , whose general form is well known . on this basis",
    "we derive entanglement inequalities , which are formulated solely in terms of general hermitian operators .",
    "we also provide an approach for optimizing such inequalities , by introducing a separability eigenvalue problem .",
    "our method is a powerful tool for analyzing experimental data , to verify any kind of entanglement .",
    "one may also identify general bound entangled states whose density operator has a positive partial transposition ( ppt ) .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : ii ] we derive the most general form of entanglement conditions in terms of hermitian operators .",
    "this leads us to an optimization problem  the separability eigenvalue problem  which is studied in sec .",
    "[ sec : iii ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : iv ] this problem is solved for a class of projection operators and a general numerical implementation of entanglement tests for arbitrary quantum states is given . a method for the identification of bound entangled states",
    "is considered in sec .",
    "[ sec : v ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : vi ] we give a brief summary and some conclusions .",
    "let us consider two systems @xmath2 and @xmath3 , represented by arbitrary hilbert spaces @xmath4 and @xmath5 with orthonormal bases being @xmath6 and @xmath7 respectively , with @xmath8 and @xmath9 being arbitrary sets .",
    "note that the hilbert spaces are not necessarily finite or separable .",
    "even spaces with an uncountable bases are under study .",
    "an entanglement witness is a bounded hermitian operator @xmath10 , which has positive expectation values for separable states and it has negative eigenvalues  @xcite . for our purposes",
    "a generalization of the class of entanglement witnesses is useful .",
    "one can think of bounded hermitian operators , which have positive expectation values for separable states : @xmath11 all operators fulfilling the conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) and ( [ cond2 ] ) shall define the set @xmath12 , operators in this set are called partial positive operators .",
    "all operators @xmath13 fulfilling the conditions @xmath14 @xmath15 together with eq .",
    "( [ cond2 ] ) , with @xmath13 in place of @xmath10 , shall denote the set @xmath16 of positive semi - definite operators .",
    "so all entanglement witnesses are elements of the difference of these sets : @xmath17 .",
    "it was shown by the horodeckis  @xcite , that for any entangled state @xmath18 there exists an entanglement witness @xmath19 , so that the expectation value becomes negative : @xmath20 .",
    "for this inseparability theorem only linear entanglement witnesses were used , which are sufficient to identify all entangled states . for this reason",
    "we restrict our considerations to linear witnesses , which are elements of the set @xmath12 .",
    "let us consider the important example of witnesses based on the pt map .",
    "recently it has been shown  @xcite , that for any state @xmath18 with a negative pt ( npt ) there exists an operator @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 these operators have been studied in detail as functions of the annihilation and creation operators of two harmonic oscillators : @xmath23 .",
    "all the resulting @xmath24 are examples of elements of @xmath12 , in particular they include all entanglement witnesses for npt states .",
    "now we will turn to the construction of entanglement witnesses in their most general form . as outlined above",
    ", the problem of finding all entanglement witnesses via pncp maps is very difficult . here",
    "we will introduce a different but equivalent approach to entanglement witnesses , which requires the class of @xmath16 operators only .",
    "a hermitian operator @xmath13 is positive , if and only if it can be written as @xmath25 in the first step we will now generate any entanglement witness out of a difference of positive operators .    for any entanglement witness @xmath10",

    "let the    supremum of all eigenvalues be    @xmath31 .",
    "for all separable quantum    states , @xmath10 must be a positive map , which implies    @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath32    which is the demanded form .",
    "to formulate a new entanglement theorem for positive hermitian operators , we need the definition of optimal entanglement witnesses as given by lewenstein _",

    "an entanglement witness @xmath36 is optimal , if and only if no witness is finer than @xmath36 .",
    "therefore a state is separable , if and only if for all optimal entanglement witnesses the expectation value is positive . to find these witnesses , we need the function @xmath37 , which maps a general hermitian operator @xmath38 to its maximal expectation value for a separable state : @xmath39 it is obvious , that a hermitian operator @xmath27 is a general element of @xmath12 , if and only if @xmath40 . and",

    "this is a kind of distance criterion .",
    "our entanglement theorem [ theo1 ] does no longer require the explicit form of any entanglement witness .",
