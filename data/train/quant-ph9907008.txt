    "this is evident to a high degree of accuracy in table [ t4 ] .",
    "one further check of the accuracy of the trial wave function is to compare its asymptotic behavior with that of the wkb approximation to @xmath13 .",

    "the results of this investigation suggest several intriguing avenues of research .",
    "the most surprising aspect of this variational calculation is that even though the stationary point is a saddle point in parameter space , and not a minimum , this saddle point clearly gives correct physical information .",
    "clearly , it is the nonpositivity of the norm that accounts for the fact that the stationary point is a saddle point .",
    "the norm used in this paper is @xmath135 rather than the conventional choice @xmath136 however , the accuracy of the variational approach suggests that we have found an extremely powerful technique for obtaining approximate solutions to complex sturm - liouville eigenvalue problems .",
    "a possible explanation for the accuracy of our approach is that while the norm we are using is not positive definite in coordinate space , we believe that it _ is _ positive definite in momentum space .",
    "the positivity for our choice of norm is easy to verify in the special case of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "we believe that this positivity property does not undergo a sudden transition as we analytically continue the theory into the complex plane by increasing @xmath2 .",
    "we point out that the strong advantage of our choice of norm is that @xmath137 is an analytic function while @xmath60 is not .",
    "this allows us to analytically continue sturm - liouville problems into the complex plane .",
    "( we point out that until now , sturm - liouville problems have been limited to the real axis . )",
    "an extremely interesting question to be considered in the future is the completeness of the eigenfunctions of a complex @xmath0-symmetric sturm - liouville problem .",
    "it is easy to show that the eigenfunctions corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal : @xmath138 however , it is not known whether the eigenfunctions form a complete set and what norm should be used in this context .",
    "it is clear that in order to answer questions regarding completeness , a full understanding of the distribution of zeros of the wave functions must be achieved . for a sturm - liouville problem limited to the real axis completeness",
    "depends on the zeros becoming dense . for the case of a regular sturm - liouville problem the zeros interlace as they become dense .",
    "our preliminary numerical investigations suggest that the zeros of the eigenfunctions of complex @xmath0-symmetric sturm - liouville problems also become dense in the complex plane and exhibit a two - dimensional generalization of the interlacing phenomenon .",
    "one area that we have investigated in great detail is the extension of these quantum mechanical variational calculations to quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "the natural technique to use is based on the schwinger - dyson equations ; successive truncation of these equations is in exact analogy with enlarging the space of parameters in the trial wave functions .",
    "we find that the schwinger - dyson equations provide an extremely accurate approximation scheme for calculating the green s functions and masses of a @xmath0-symmetric quantum field theory .",
