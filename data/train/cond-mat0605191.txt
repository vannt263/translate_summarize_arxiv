    "quantum phase transitions in heavy fermion systems between a fermi liquid and antiferromagnetically ( af ) ordered state have been at the focus of research recently @xcite .",
    "this is due to mainly two reasons : firstly in the vicinity of the quantum critical point ( qcp ) which is usually reached by applying external or doping - induced chemical pressure , the intrinsic energy scale of the compound , i.e. , effective fermi temperature t@xmath5 or nel temperature t@xmath6 vanishes .",
    "this leads to a breakdown of the fermi liquid picture and non - fermi liquid behavior of thermodynamic and transport quantities is observed close to the qcp @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to understand the approach to the quantum critical region within suitable theoretical models .",
    "the most important among them is the kondo lattice model consisting of a free conduction band and an on - site af kondo interaction which favors nonmagnetic singlet formation . in the second order it also leads to the effective inter - site rkky interactions which favor magnetic order .",
    "their competition leads to the appearance of the qcp .",
    "in such a picture only spin degrees of freedom are involved in the quantum phase transition .",
    "therefore the kondo lattice model may be replaced by a simpler model where the itinerant hopping part is simulated by an inter - site interaction of the itinerant spins . in the work of doniach @xcite it was shown that in dimension d=1 this replacement , leading to the kondo - necklace model is indeed exact assuming that the inter - site interaction is of the xy - type .",
    "later more general anisotropic inter - site interactions have been considered including the z - component of conduction - electron spins @xcite . in the itinerant picture",
    "this would be equivalent to adding an interaction term for conduction electrons , i.e. , considering kondo spins that are screened by correlated conduction electrons @xcite .",
    "in addition the kondo - necklace model was considered in higher dimension @xcite . in this case the direct connection to the original itinerant kondo lattice model is lost .",
    "one then has to consider the kondo necklace model for d @xmath7 2 as a model in its own right .",
    "in fact exact diagonalisation results @xcite for finite clusters show that the two models are still closely related even for d = 2 .    in the present work we want to study the possible quantum phase transition in the d = 1 - 3 kondo - necklace type model under rather general assumption of the anisotropy of both the inter - site interaction and on - site kondo terms .",
    "they are characterised by the pair of parameters ( @xmath8 ) . for the former @xmath9 0 describes the deviation from the xy- type interaction associated with free conduction electrons in 1d and for the latter @xmath10 1 describes deviation from the isotropic on - site kondo interaction .",
    "the @xmath1 anisotropy is always present in real kondo compounds like ce - based intermetallics due to the crystalline electric field ( cef ) .    for uniaxial symmetry",
    "it splits the j @xmath11 multiplet into a sequence of kramers doublets .",
    "the ground state doublet @xmath12 may be described by a pseudo - spin s=@xmath13 . projecting the kondo term to this subspace then leads to different on - site exchange for s@xmath14 and s@xmath15 components .",
    "this defines a local anisotropy ratio @xmath1 = j@xmath15/j@xmath16 of the pseudo - spin kondo term .",
    "in real kondo compounds this ratio may assume any value between the easy axis ( ising - like ) case @xmath17 and the easy - plane ( xy - like ) case @xmath1 = 0 .",
    "examples of tetragonal compounds are ceru@xmath18si@xmath18 @xcite for the former and ybrh@xmath18si@xmath18 @xcite for the latter .",
    "we study the quantum phase transition from the paramagnetic ( kondo - singlet ) side as function of the control paramter @xmath19 giving the ratio of inter - site to on - site interaction strength and as function of the ansisotropies ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) .",
    "previously this has only been performed in the special case ( @xmath0,@xmath1)=(0,1 ) @xcite . for the case of general ( @xmath0,@xmath1 )",
    "we use the same bond operator representations of spin variables where on - site constraints are implemented in mean field approximation .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we give a brief definition of the anisotropic kondo necklace model and the bond - operator transformation . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the ground state energy and excitation spectrum is calculated in mean field approximation .",

    "the hopping parameter of the itinerant electrons is proportional to @xmath25 with the anisotropy in the z - direction given by @xmath0 .",
    "therefore the above model has three control parameters : @xmath19 and the anisotropies ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) .",
    "there are two main reasons for considering the anisotropy both in the itinerant and localized parts of the interactions : ( _ i _ ) in real materials where the kondo effect has been observed there exists the anisotropy in the interaction between the localized and itinerant electrons .",

    "we have followed the mean - field approach introduced in ref . where the local constraint is replaced by a global one for the average amplitudes @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in this respect",
    "we start from the strong coupling limit @xmath44 ( @xmath30 ) where the ground state is composed of the direct product of local singlets . in this limit",

    "we have studied the quantum critical properties of the fully anisotropic kondo - necklace model in dimension d=1 - 3 .",
    "we used the bond - operator representation of spin variables with constraints implemented in the mean field approximation . for general anisotropy ratios ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 )",
    "we have calculated the critical values @xmath2 and the scaling exponenets of the kondo singlet gap close to the quantum critical point which correspond to the mean field exponents .",
    "we find that in general the anisotropy @xmath1 of the local kondo term influences the qualitative behavior of the singlet gap only little , although the value of the critical ratio @xmath2 depends strongly on @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 decreases the kondo singlet is destabilized and the critical value @xmath2 decreases . on the other hand",
    "the anisotropy of the inter - site term which mimics the itinerant electrons has a weak effect on the position of the critical point ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) and leaves the universal behavior similar as in the conventional xy - type ( @xmath0 = 0 ) kondo necklace model . on approaching the su(2 ) heisenberg case ( @xmath0 , @xmath1)=(1,1 ) @xmath87 exhibits a singular behaviour as function of anisotropies .",
    "this is most pronounced in d=2 where also the scaling coefficient ( not the exponent ) of the gap close to the qcp changes considerably as compared to the @xmath0 = 0 case .",
    "furthermore the value of the critical @xmath2 with properly defined scale @xmath133 exhibits a jump at @xmath0=1 .",
    "this peculiar effect is due to a mode crossing of the x , y and z branches of excitations at the af wave vector as function of @xmath0 .",
    "we have also derived and solved the selfconsistency equations on the magnetic side for general ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "this allows us to give an explicit expression for the quantum critical point value @xmath87 as function of anisotropy parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 ) for the cases @xmath0=0 or @xmath1=1 for dimension d=2,3 . to discuss the scaling exponents beyond mean field approximation the renormalisation of triplet excitation energies close to the qcp caused by fluctuations in the bosonic variables has to be included",
    "the authors would like to thank burkhard schmidt and ivica zerec for discussions .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath51 and @xmath52 introduced in sect .  [ sec3 ] in terms of bond operators are as follows : h_2&=&_n , m((t^_n , y t_n , z- h.c . ) ( t^_m , y t_m , z- h.c . ) + ( t^_n , x t_n , z- h.c.)(t^_m , x t_m , z- h.c . )",

    "since the triplet occupation is very small in the ground state , the effect of @xmath51 on the mean field result is negligible .",
    "the remaining part of @xmath167 is expressed by @xmath52 which gives zero contribution to the ground state energy in the mean field approximation .",
