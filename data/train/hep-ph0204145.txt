    "some time ago a new mechanism for the production of hard photons in a quark - gluon plasma was proposed @xcite : the photon is produced by the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair ",
    "after \" one of the annihilating quark or antiquark has scattered in the medium ( diagram on the right of figure [ fig : processes ] ) . this process is contained in the two - loop diagrams @xcite of the hard thermal loop ( htl - @xcite ) resummed theory . in the htl approach quarks acquire a thermal mass in the plasma and , at lowest order in the strong coupling , the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair into a real photon is kinematically forbidden .",
    "however when the annihilation is associated to scattering in the plasma one of the quarks becomes off - shell and the annihilation is possible .",
    "the interesting feature of the mechanism is that , apart from the exponential suppression factor common to all thermal processes , the photon production rate grows with the energy of the photon , leaving it as the only relevant mechanism when the photon energy is much larger than the temperature . in particular",
    ", it dominates over all other processes contained in the one - loop approximation @xcite of the htl approach ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) which only grow logarithmically with the photon energy .",
    "recent studies , in the framework of the hydrodynamical evolution of the plasma @xcite , have shown that thermal production of a photon , including the  off - shell annihilation \" process , is already significant at sps energies and could dominate at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "there is then a window , of photon energies of a few gev , which could provide a signal for the formation of the plasma in heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , in this energy range , there is a very large background of pions which decay into photons . whether the flux of thermal photons can be identified over the large background",
    "is under study . in view of this problem",
    "it may be useful to consider an alternative signal which follows the same dynamics as real photon production but which suffers from a different experimental background .",
    "the production of small mass ( @xmath3 ) dilepton pairs at relatively hard energy ( @xmath4 ) is such a process and this is what is considered below in the limit @xmath5 .",
    "considering lepton pair production leads to an interesting situation where two hard scales , @xmath6 the temperature and @xmath4 , and three small scales , @xmath7 , @xmath8 the thermal mass of fermions and @xmath9 the thermal mass of the gluon enter the game .",
    "it turns out that several of these scales combine in a single expression @xmath10 which acts as a cut - off to regularize potential collinear singularities associated with the fermion propagators .",
    "however , in the off - shell annihilation process , @xmath11 can vanish and even become negative .",
    "its role as a cut - off is then blurred !",
    "this occurs when the condition @xmath12 is satisfied . in this case",
    ", lepton pairs can be produced at @xmath13 in the strong interactions by the annihilation of a @xmath14 pair , a new feature compared to the case of real photon production .",
    "when going to higher orders in the strong interactions it means that two types of diagrams will contribute , which are usually referred to as real and virtual diagrams .",
    "this point , which involves the compensation of divergences between the two types of diagrams @xcite , will be discussed in some details below as it has no equivalent in the case of real photon production .",
    "even after all divergences are cancelled , the dilepton invariant mass spectrum still exhibits an integrable singularity at @xmath15 .",
    "this is in agreement with a theorem of perturbation theory @xcite which states that if an observable has its phase space restricted by a @xmath16 function at a given order of the perturbative expansion , it may exhibit @xmath17 function singularity at the next order .",
    "the collinear enhancement mechanism that makes the processes of figure [ fig : processes ] important has also been shown to play a role in multi - loop diagrams belonging to the class of ladder corrections and self - energy - corrections @xcite , and a resummation of this family of diagrams has been carried out in @xcite .",
    "the effect of this resummation , also known as landau - pomeranchuk - migdal ( lpm ) effect @xcite , leads to a small reduction ( by about 25% for photons in the range interesting for phenomenology ) of the photon rate . assuming that the magnitude of this effect remains comparable for reasonable photon invariant masses ( the photon mass helps to regularize the collinear singularities ) , we limit ourselves to a 2-loop calculation .",
    "these contributions add up to the processes @xmath18 and @xmath19 already calculated in @xcite .    in the following section , we set up the formalism , then we discuss the matrix element showing , before carrying out the phase space integration , that cancellation of some infra - red divergences can be expected between vertex and self energy diagrams . in sec .",
    "4 the phase space integration is carried out while in sec .",
    "5 the behavior of the spectrum near the singular point @xmath15 is studied analytically and found to be in complete agreement with the numerical studies . finally , sec .",
    "6 is devoted to some simple phenomenological studies .",
    "an appendix contains details of the phase space integration .    in our study on dilepton pair production",
    "we rederive , as the limit when the dilepton mass vanishes , the results already obtained on real photon production .",
    "the method we follow is however simpler than previously used",
    ". it still uses the retarded / advanced ( r / a ) formalism @xcite but it relies on carrying out some integrations in the complex energy plane for which the r / a formalism is well suited .",
    "furthermore , when discussing the compensation of divergences and calculating the remaining finite pieces , there is no need to go to @xmath20dimensions or introduce regulators since the compensations can be seen within the integrand .",
    "some of the results of this paper rely on a new sum - rule presented elsewhere @xcite , which allows to analytically carry out otherwise difficult numerical integrations .",
    "in a quark - gluon plasma in local thermal equilibrium , the number of lepton pairs produced from virtual photons per unit time and per unit volume is conveniently expressed in terms of the imaginary part of the retarded photon polarization tensor , calculated in presence of the plasma @xcite : @xmath21 in this formula , the sum over the phase - space of the lepton pair in which the virtual photon decays has been performed , at a fixed total momentum @xmath22 of the pair .",
    "the trace over the lorentz indices @xmath23 indicates that both the longitudinal and transverse modes of the massive photon are included .",
    "note that this formula is valid at lowest order in the electromagnetic coupling constant , and at all orders in the strong coupling constant . in more physical terms",
    ", it neglects the possible reinteractions of the photon or leptons on their way out of the plasma , and it is valid only if the size of the system is small compared to the mean free path of a photon or lepton .",
    "another limitation of this formula is that it holds for a plasma in thermal and chemical equilibrium .",
    "however , it can also be applied to a situation where there is only a local equilibrium , provided the typical size of the cells over which the system can be considered to be equilibrated is large in front of the photon formation time @xcite .",
    "if this condition is not satisfied , one has to go back to basics , and use a non - equilibrium real - time formulation in order to compute the rate @xcite .      in order to perform this calculation using thermal field theory",
    ", one must resum the bare propagators and vertices in order to account for the fact that medium effects modify the interactions and properties of the excitations of the plasma .",
    "in particular , medium induced masses are of utmost importance for quarks in processes where the photon is predominantly produced in a collinear configuration . in thermal field theory , this is achieved through the htl resummation , which resums an infinite set of one - loop thermal corrections to propagators and vertices .    since the quarks are always hard in the processes we consider throughout this paper , we keep only the asymptotic thermal mass from the htl fermionic self - energy @xcite , which leads to the following retarded and advanced propagators @xmath24 with @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the square of the thermal mass of a hard quark ( @xmath27 is the casimir in the fundamental representation of the gauge group @xmath28 ) .",
    "ordinarily , one does not need effective @xmath29 vertices if the quarks are hard , since the htl corrections are suppressed .",
    "but this is correct only if the terms we are calculating are at leading order .",
    "photon production however involves an important cancellation between the components @xmath30 and @xmath31 of the photon polarization tensor , and the remaining terms in @xmath32 are non leading , and are affected by the htl corrections to the vertex .",
    "however , one can check that it modifies only the @xmath31 component , and therefore forgetting it had no impact on the result of @xcite who calculated only the transverse components ( since @xmath33 for real photons ) . for virtual photons ,",
    "one has to include the temporal and longitudinal components as well , and one can not avoid using this vertex correction . ] . in the following , we do not need the explicit form of the vertex , but only need to know how it is related to the self - energy correction by means of ward identities .",
    "in other words , it is important to make sure that we do for the effective vertex an approximation which is consistent with the approximation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : eff - prop ] ) made for the quark propagator . in particular , we want to preserve the relations satisfied by the full htl corrections ( for a vertex in which a quark enters with momentum @xmath34 and goes out with momentum @xmath35 ) : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the htl correction to the vertex . in the following , it will be useful to write @xmath38    in addition , we need the effective retarded and advanced propagators of a gluon , which can be decomposed into its transverse and longitudinal components : @xmath39 where @xmath40 are respectively the transverse and longitudinal projectors ] ] for a gauge boson of momentum @xmath41 @xcite : @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and where @xmath45 is the mean velocity of the plasma in the frame under consideration .",
    "the propagators of the transverse and longitudinal modes are then given by @xmath46 with the following htl self - energies @xmath47\\nonumber\\\\   & \\pi^{^{l}}(l)=3 m_{\\rm g}^2&\\left [ ( 1-x^2)-{{x(1-x^2)}\\over{2}}\\ln\\left({{x+1}\\over{x-1}}\\right ) \\right]\\ ; , \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\label{gluonself}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we denote @xmath48 and where @xmath49/9 $ ] is the gluon thermal mass in an @xmath28 gauge theory with @xmath50 flavors .",
    "note that an implicit continuation @xmath51 is understood in this self - energy in order to obtain its retarded and advanced components .",
    "let us now move to the two - loop diagrams calculated in this paper .",
    "they are the same as those already considered in @xcite for real photons and in @xcite for soft dileptons produced at rest in the plasma frame .",
    "one of them is a vertex correction to the one - loop photon self - energy , and the other is a self - energy insertion on one of the quarks lines ( see figure [ fig : diagrams ] ) .",
    "there is however one major difference compared to the case of real photons : as long as the invariant mass of the lepton pair is @xmath52 , the cuts denoted by @xmath53 and @xmath54 in figure [ fig : diagrams ] do not contribute .",
    "indeed , they correspond to the interference between the tree - level process @xmath55 and a virtual correction to this process , but this direct production mechanism has a threshold at @xmath56 . above the threshold , one must include these cuts , and in fact the various cuts partly compensate each other through the kln mechanism .",
    "it is convenient to use the retarded - advanced formalism @xcite in order to compute the retarded photon polarization tensor needed in eq .",
    "( [ eq : def - rate ] ) . throughout this paper , we assume that the gluon of momentum @xmath41 ( see diagrams and notations in figure [ fig : diagrams ] ) is soft , so that the corresponding bose - einstein factor @xmath57 is large , in particular large compared to fermionic statistical factors . when performing the integrals , one can check the validity of this hypothesis .",
    "therefore , we keep only those terms containing this enhanced bose - einstein factor , and we approximate @xmath58 .    using this approximation , the contribution of the first diagram ( which we designate by `` vertex correction '' in the following ) of figure [ fig : diagrams ] to the photon polarization tensor is given by : @xmath59\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times\\int { { d^4l}\\over{(2\\pi)^4}}{t\\over{l_0 } } \\sum_{\\alpha = t , l } \\rho_\\alpha(l ) p_\\alpha^{\\rho\\sigma}(l ) { \\rm trace}^{\\rm vert}_{\\rho\\sigma}\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times [ s_{_{r}}(p)s_{_{r}}(p+l)-s_{_{a}}(p)s_{_{a}}(p+l)]\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\times [ s_{_{r}}(r)s_{_{r}}(r+l)-s_{_{a}}(r)s_{_{a}}(r+l)]\\ ; , \\label{eq : vertex1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the spectral function for the mode @xmath61 of the effective gluon propagator : @xmath62 and where @xmath63 denotes the trace of the dirac matrices for this diagram : @xmath64\\ , .\\ ] ] this trace contains four hard momenta , and is a priori of order @xmath65 or larger .",
    "it is however important to keep also subleading terms of order @xmath66 since the cancellation between @xmath30 and @xmath31 kills all the leading terms when the vertex and self - energy diagrams are combined .",
    "however , it is safe to drop all the smaller corrections , i.e. terms of order @xmath67 or smaller . expanding this trace up to terms with two powers of a soft quantity , we find contracted with the projectors @xmath68 gives a vanishing result , we have dropped the terms proportional to this quantity . ] : @xmath69\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this expression , one can even drop the terms with two powers of the vertex correction @xmath70 , since they would be smaller than the terms we are interested in here . using the pseudo ward identities of eqs .",
