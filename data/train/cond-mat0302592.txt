    "several years ago the square - lattice helimagnet ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1  was recognized as an extremely interesting material for studying dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) off - diagonal exchange interactions .",
    "a great deal of attention was given to the incommensurate nature of the magnetic ground state,@xcite a unique field - induced incommensurate - to - commensurate ( ic ) transition,@xcite and the field dependence of the spiral spin structure.@xcite studies of the spin wave spectrum in the incommensurate@xcite and commensurate@xcite phases led to the first direct observation of a new type of magnetic interactions in insulators , the so - called ksea term.@xcite additional theoretical studies shed light on the nature of the so - called `` intermediate phase''.@xcite    a recent study indicated that an ic transition in ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1  can be induced not only by applying an external magnetic field , but also by a partial chemical substitution of the spin - carrying cu@xmath2 ions by co@xmath2.@xcite for all co - concentrations @xmath3 the solid solution ba@xmath4co@xmath5cu@xmath6ge@xmath0o@xmath1  orders magnetically at temperatures between @xmath7  k ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9  k ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "magnetization data suggest that the helimagnetic state realized at @xmath8 gives way to a canted weak - ferromagnetic structure at some critical concentration @xmath11 , estimated to be between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the mechanism of this transition or crossover is poorly understood .",
    "one possible explanation was proposed in ref .  .",
    "the structure of ba@xmath4co@xmath5cu@xmath6ge@xmath0o@xmath1  is tetragonal , the @xmath14 cu@xmath2 or @xmath15 co@xmath2 ions forming a square lattice within the @xmath16 crystallographic plane .",
    "the dominant interaction is the antiferromagnetic ( af ) coupling @xmath17 between nearest - neighbor ( nn ) sites along the @xmath18 direction . in the @xmath8",
    "compound the helimagnetic distortion is caused by the in - plane component @xmath19 of the dzyaloshinskii vector @xmath20 associated with the same cu - cu bonds.@xcite this component retains its direction from one bond to the next , and thus favors a spin spiral state.@xcite in contrast , the out - of - plane component @xmath21 is sign - alternating and stabilizes a weak - ferromagnetic structure .",
    "the @xmath22-axis component of @xmath20 was never detected in ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 , where it was assumed to be weak . in ref .",
    "it was tentatively suggested that the out - of - plane component is dominant in the co - based @xmath10 material , and stabilizes a commensurate magnetic structure . to verify this hypothesis and better understand the underlying physics , a detailed knowledge of magnetic interactions",

    "the nn co - co distance is thus along the @xmath18 direction and equal to @xmath29   . for the present study we utilized two single crystal samples prepared using the floating zone technique .",
    "both crystals were cylindrical , roughly 5  mm diameter @xmath30 50  mm long , with a mosaic spread of about @xmath31 .",
    "the first series of experiments was carried out at the hb1 3-axis spectrometer installed at the high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory ( setup i ) .",

    "note that the interactions along the @xmath42 axis are not included in the above expression .",
    "they were not measured directly in this work , and are likely to be ferromagnetic , due to the value of the magnetic ordering vector .",

    "the strong anisotropy effects in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1  push all spins in the system into the @xmath16 crystallographic plane .",
    "this effect is similar to that of a magnetic field applied along the @xmath42 axis that favors an @xmath16-planar state in ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite since the helimagnet - forming uniform component @xmath19 of the dzyaloshinskii vector is itself in the @xmath16 plane , forcing the spins into the @xmath16 plane makes the corresponding triple - product in the hamiltonian @xmath68 vanish .",
    "only the non - helimagnet - forming sign - alternating @xmath22-axis component of @xmath20 remains relevant . as a result",
    ", the spin structure may be slightly canted , but is , nevertheless , commensurate .",
    "it is important to stress that effective easy - plane anisotropy was previously detected in ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1  as well .",
    "however , in this @xmath14 cu - based system any single - ion term is reduced to a constant and is therefore irrelevant .",
    "the only source of anisotropy is a two - ion term , which was shown to be caused by the so - called ksea interactions.@xcite the latter are a very weak effect with an energy scale of @xmath69 . on a square lattice",
    "ksea interactions happen to be just strong enough to distort the helical structure , but not to fully destroy incommensurability.@xcite in contrast , as follows from the present study , easy - plane anisotropy in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1  is _ much stronger _",
    ", of the order of @xmath17 itself .",
    "the anisotropy is probably due to single - ion effects that are only allowed for @xmath70 , and its magnitude is well beyond the critical value needed to destroy the helimagnetic state .",
    "the results discussed above allows us to speculate about the ic transition in ba@xmath4co@xmath5cu@xmath6ge@xmath0o@xmath1  that occurs with increasing co - concentration @xmath3 .",
    "each co - impurity _ strongly _ `` pins '' the original spiral at the impurity site , firmly confining the corresponding spin to the @xmath16 plane .",
    "helimagnetic correlations are totally destroyed when the characteristic distance between such strong - pinning locations becomes comparable with the period of the unperturbed spiral , which in ba@xmath0cuge@xmath0o@xmath1  is roughly 40 nearest - neighbor bonds.@xcite this suggests a critical concentration of about @xmath71% , in reasonable agreement with bulk magnetization data of ref .  .",
    "to summarize , the commensurate nature of the ground state in ba@xmath0coge@xmath0o@xmath1is primarily due not to a dominant staggered component of the dzyaloshinskii vector , but to easy - plane anisotropy effects that are _ orders of magnitude stronger _ than typical dzyaloshinskii - moriya or ksea interactions . as a result , the destruction of helimagntism in ba@xmath4co@xmath5cu@xmath6ge@xmath0o@xmath1  occurs very rapidly with increasing co - concentration , as soon as the mean distance between impurities becomes comparable to the period of the spin spiral .",
