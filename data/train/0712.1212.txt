    "white dwarf stars are the final evolutionary stage for the vast majority of stars and , hence , they play a key role in our quest for understanding the structure and history of our galaxy .",
    "standard stellar evolution theory predicts that most white dwarfs are the descendants of post - asymptotic gianch branch stars of low and intermediate masses that reach the hot white dwarf stage with hydrogen - rich surface layers .",
    "the basic inner structure expected in a typical white dwarf consists of a degenerate core mostly composed of a mixture of carbon and oxygen ( the ashes of core helium burning resulting from the evolution of the progenitor ) plus some impurities resulting from the original metal content of the progenitor star .",
    "the most important of these impurities is @xmath0ne , which results from helium burning on @xmath4n  built up during the cno cycle of hydrogen burning  and reaches an abundance by mass of @xmath5 0.02 in population i stars .",
    "an accurate determination of the rate at which white dwarfs cool down constitutes a fundamental issue and provides a independent valuable cosmic clock to determine ages of many galactic populations , including the disk ( winget et al .",
    "1987 ; garca - berro et al .",
    "1988 ; hernanz et al . 1994 ) and globular and open clusters ( richer et al . 1997 ; von hippel & gilmore 2000 ; hansen et al . 2002 ; von hippel et al . 2006 ) .",
    "thus , considerable effort has been devoted to observationally determine the luminosity function of field white dwarfs  which also provides a measure of the cooling rate  and to empirically determine the observed white dwarf cooling sequence in stellar clusters . additionally , and from the theoretical point of view ,",
    "the development of very detailed white dwarf evolutionary models , that incorporate a complete description of the main energy sources , has also been a priority , since it allows a meaningful comparison with the increasing wealth of observational data ( fontaine et al . 2001 ; salaris et al . 2000",
    "; althaus & benvenuto 1998 ) .    white dwarf evolution can be basically described as a simple cooling process ( mestel 1952 ) in which the decrease in the thermal heat content of the ions constitutes the main source of luminosity . the release of both latent heat ( van horn 1968 ; lamb & van horn 1975 ) and of gravitational energy due to a change in chemical composition during crystallization ( stevenson 1980 ; garca  berro et al .",
    "1988 ; segretain et al .",
    "1994 ; isern et al .",
    "1991 , 2000 ) also affects considerably the cooling of white dwarfs .",
    "in particular , compositional separation at crystallization temporarily slows down the cooling .",
    "this , in turn , influences the position of the cut - off of the disk white dwarf luminosity function ( hernanz et al .",
    "1994 ) , which is essential in obtaining and independent determination of the age of the galactic disk .",
    "another potential source of energy are the minor species rich in neutrons , such as @xmath0ne .",
    "indeed , as first noted by bravo et al .",
    "( 1992 ) the two extra neutrons present in the @xmath0ne nucleus ( relative to @xmath6 ) results in a net downward gravitational force and a slow , diffusive settling of @xmath0ne in the liquid regions towards the center of the white dwarf .",
    "the role of @xmath0ne sedimentation in the energetics of crystallizing white dwarf was first addressed by isern et al .",
    "the extent to which the cooling of a white dwarf could be modified by this process was later investigated by bildsten & hall ( 2001 ) and quantitatively explored by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) . depending on the underlying uncertainties in the physics of the interdiffusion coefficients ,",
    "deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) concluded that @xmath0ne sedimentation could release sufficient energy to affect appreciably the cooling of massive white dwarfs , making them appear bright for very long periods of time , of the order of @xmath7 yr .",
    "deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) predicted that the possible impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on white dwarf cooling could be seen in metal - rich clusters .",
    "in fact , white dwarfs resulting from progenitors formed in metal - rich systems are expected to have larger abundances of @xmath0ne in their cores , and the delay in the cooling history of white dwarfs resulting from @xmath0ne diffusion would be largely amplified in these clusters .",
    "the recent detection of a markedly bright white dwarf population in the old open cluster ngc 6791 ( bedin et al . 2005 ) is certainly promising in this regard . indeed ,",
    "the significant supersolar metallicity characterizing ngc 6791 ( about [ fe / h ] @xmath8 ) turns this cluster into a unique target to test the predictions of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) , who claim that the effects of sedimentation would be largest in this cluster .",
    "although the anomalously bright white dwarf luminosity function observed in ngc 6791 could be reflecting the presence of a large population of massive white dwarfs with helium cores instead of carbon - oxygen cores , as suggested by hansen ( 2005 ) , @xmath0ne diffusion constitutes a viable explanation for the morphology of the observed white dwarf luminosity function that can not be discarded ( kalirai et al . 2007 ) .",
    "in view of these considerations , a full and consistent treatment of white dwarf evolution is required to ascertain the validity of the predictions of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) about the role of @xmath0ne diffusion in cooling white dwarfs , since their findings were obtained using a simplified treatment of white dwarf evolution . in particular , although deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) carried out a full numerical calculation of the diffusion process , the white dwarf cooling sequences were computed using a series of static white dwarf mechanical configurations in which the thermal evolution of the white dwarf was decoupled and , moreover , the authors did not mention whether or not the mechanical structure of the white dwarf was recomputed self - consistently at each time step .",
    "another crucial point is that the white dwarf models of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) were constructed using a fully degenerate equation of state everywhere ( with no inclusion of ion contributions in the structure calculation ) .",
    "this assumption is valid for the white dwarf interior , where the degeneracy is high , but not for the outer nondegenerate parts of the star .",
    "in addition , the treatment of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) required as an additional input a relationship between the luminosity of the white dwarf and the temperature of the core  for which they adopted the results of althaus & benvenuto ( 1998 )  which , additionally , was assumed to be isothermal . as a result",
    ", the heat sources and sinks could only be evaluated globally and not locally as we do here .",
    "consequently , these authors could not obtain absolute ages but , rather , relative delays with respect to the absolute ages derived by althaus & benvenuto ( 1998 ) .",
    "the aim of the present work is , precisely , to fill this gap .",
    "specifically , we present a set of full evolutionary and self - consistent white dwarf cooling sequences , which include an accurate treatment of time - dependent @xmath0ne diffusion and the physical state of the white dwarf interior .",
    "special emphasis is given to the treatment of the luminosity equation , particularly regarding the contribution to the energy balance of the terms resulting from changes in the profiles of chemical abundances .",
    "calculations are followed down to very low surface luminosities .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "section 2 contains details about the input physcis of our white dwarf evolutionary code and the main aspects of the diffusion treatment . in sect .",
    "3 we present our results .",
    "finally , sect .",
    "4 is devoted to discussing and summarizing our findings .",
    "in this work we have computed the evolution of white dwarfs self - consistently , taking into account the changes in the abundance profiles induced by the gravitational settling of @xmath0ne .",
    "that is , we have solved the full set of equations describing the structure and evolution of white dwarfs with the luminosity equation appropriately modified to account for the energy released by the changes in the core abundances as a consequence of @xmath0ne sedimentation .",
    "consequently , this study constitutes a notable improvement with respect to the approach adopted by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) to compute the white dwarf cooling sequences , where all energy sources were treated as global quantities .",
    "the evolutionary code employed in this study is the one we used in our study of the evolution of massive white dwarf stars ( althaus et al . 2007 ) , modified to incorporate the effects of @xmath0ne sedimentation in the interior of white dwarfs . in particular , the equation of state for the high - density regime is very detailed and it is described in segretain et al .",
    "it accounts for all the important contributions for both the liquid and solid phases . the release of latent heat upon crystallization  which is assumed to occur when the ion coupling constant reaches @xmath9= 180 ( stringfellow et al .",
    "1990 ; chabrier 1993 )  and neutrino emission rates have been included following althaus et al .",
    "radiative opacities are those from opal ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) complemented at low temperatures with the alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) molecular opacities .",
    "chemical redistribution due to phase separation upon crystallization has not been considered in this work .",
    "particular attention is given to the treatment of the very outer layers of our models at advanced stages of evolution .",
    "this is crucial in determining absolute ages . in particular , compression of these layers",
    "constitutes the main energy source of the white dwarf when it enters the debye regime . in the present calculations ,",
    "the internal solutions of the henyey iteration have been considered up to a fitting mass fraction of @xmath10 .",
    "the initial white dwarf configuration from which we started our calculations of the cooling sequences correspond to hot white dwarf structures that were obtained following the artificial evolutionary procedure described in althaus et al ( 2005 ) .",
    "because the impact of @xmath0ne diffusion on the cooling times is irrelevant for the hot white dwarf regime , the precise election of the initial conditions bears virtually no relevance for the purposes of the present work .",
    "we compute the evolution of white dwarf models with stellar masses of 0.6 and @xmath11 .",
    "more massive white dwarfs are expected to have cores composed mainly of oxygen and neon , the result of carbon burning in semidegenerate conditions in the progenitor star ( ritossa et al .",

    ", we explore the evolution of white dwarfs resulting from population i star progenitors , i.e. , characterized by @xmath12 0.02 .",
    "although the theory of stellar evolution predicts the core of most white dwarfs to be composed essentially by a mixture of carbon and oxygen , we assume either carbon- or oxygen - dominated cores to be consistent with the one - component plasma underlying assumption in the derivation of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the outer layer chemical stratification of all of our models consists of a pure hydrogen envelope of @xmath13 ( plus a small inner tail ) overlying a helium - dominated shell and , below that , a buffer rich in carbon and oxygen .",

    "note that because @xmath0ne sedimentation is a slower process in low - mass white dwarfs , it will take long for @xmath0ne settling to contribute to the energy budget of the star .",
    "since less massive white dwarfs crystallize at much lower effective temperatures than massive ones , this contribution will play some role at the very late stages of evolution .",
    "it is worth noting that the qualitative behavior of the evolution of the global energetics of our full sequences resembles that reported by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) . in part",
    ", this is expected since  as noted by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 )  the diffusion timescale in the white dwarf core is much longer than the time on which energy is transferred through the core .",
    "we expect then a similar behavior between both sets of calculations , as discussed below .",

    "the top and bottom panels of each of these figures are for carbon- and oxygen - rich cores , respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath0ne diffusion profoundly influences the cooling times , particularly those of massive white dwarfs .",
    "this influence becomes more dramatic in the case of efficient diffusion  this is , the case in which @xmath82 is adopted  which corresponds to the dashed curves .",
    "the star will spend a long time to get rid of the energy released by the diffusion - induced abundance changes , with the consequent marked lengthening of evolutionary times persisting until low luminosities . from the discussion in the preceding paragraph",
    ", it is evident that the signatures of @xmath0ne diffusion in the white dwarf cooling track start to manifest themselves earlier in more massive white dwarfs  at @xmath116 .",
    "the delay in the cooling times depends not only on the stellar mass , but also markedly on the chemical composition of the core .",
    "for instance , for the case @xmath82 , the delays introduced in the @xmath117 carbon - rich sequence amount to 2.45 and 3.24 gyr at @xmath118 and @xmath119 , respectively , as compared with the 0.5 and 0.6 gyr in the case of the oxygen - rich sequence . in low - mass white dwarfs , appreciable delays in the cooling rates",

    "but for the @xmath120 white dwarf sequences .",
    "]    the cooling rate in the case that white dwarfs experience a transition to a glassy state behaves differently since in this case @xmath0ne sedimentation continues releasing energy even at very large @xmath9 values .",
    "this distinct behavior can be appreciated in the two cooling curves of the @xmath88 carbon - rich sequences shown as dashed and dot  dot  dashed curves which correspond , respectively , to a sequence that experiences crystallization ( with @xmath82 ) and to a sequence that undergoes a glassy transition ( with @xmath121 ) . in fact , the decline in the luminosity contribution from @xmath0ne sedimentation due to the presence of the crystalline core , see fig .",
    "[ hr106 ] , translates into a change of slope in the cooling curve with @xmath82 at @xmath122 .",
    "by contrast , the cooling rate for glassy white dwarfs remains much smaller .",
    "we thus expect substantially larger delays in the cooling ages if a transition to a glassy state actually occurs in nature . in this case",
    ", massive white dwarfs would remain bright even at exceedingly large ages .",
    "note that during the crystallization stage , sequences that experience a glassy transition ( in the case @xmath106 ) are younger than sequences without diffusion .",
    "this is because the glassy white dwarf does not release latent heat . because crystallization is more relevant in less massive white dwarfs",
    ", this behavior is more evident in such white dwarfs .    , @xmath73 , and glassy state with @xmath113 .",
    "the thick ( thin ) set of lines are for the model sequence with carbon- ( oxygen- ) rich cores . ]    in closing , we note that the more sophisticated and self - consistent treatment of white dwarf evolution with diffusively evolving @xmath0ne abundances done in this work yields results that are in qualitative agreement with those of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) which were obtained using a global and much more simplified treatment of white dwarf evolution . however , there are quantitative differences . in the interest of comparison ,",

    "[ comparo ] the age difference between our sequences with @xmath82 and @xmath73 and the sequence in which @xmath0ne diffusion is not considered .",
    "results for both carbon - rich and oxygen - rich core compositions are illustrated .",
    "this figure can be compared with figure 10 of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) .",
    "although a direct comparison is not easy because deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) consider cores composed by a mixture of carbon and oxygen , a close inspection of the figures reveals that for both stellar masses our calculations predict age differences larger by a factor of @xmath3 when compared with the age differences obtained by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) .",
    "in fact , we find that the impact of @xmath0ne diffusion on the white dwarf cooling ages is substantially more important than originally inferred by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) . for the case in which a glassy transition is considered ,",
    "we find marked differences between both sets of calculations for the low - mass sequence .",
    "indeed , in our calculations , the glassy sequence remains younger than the standard sequence without diffusion throughout the entire evolution ( we stress that the glassy sequence does not release latent heat ) , while in the deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) treatment , once the crystallization process is finished , the released energy from @xmath0ne diffusion in the glassy sequence yields an age increase .",
    "motivated by the theoretical proposal that the cooling of white dwarfs could be altered by the sedimentation of @xmath0ne in the liquid interior of these stars ( bravo 1992 ; bildsten & hall 2001 ; deloye & bildsten 2002 ) and the possibility that this could leave imprints in the white dwarf population of metal - rich systems , we have presented in this paper detailed evolutionary calculations to address this issue .",
    "these are the first fully self - consistent evolutionary calculations of this effect .",
    "we have explored several possibilities . in particular we have thoroughly analyzed two classes of cooling sequences .",
    "the first class corresponds to an otherwise typical @xmath123 white dwarf , whereas the second one corresponds to a massive @xmath11 white dwarf .",
    "also the effects of the core composition have been addressed by following cooling sequences for carbon cores with a small admixture of @xmath0ne and the corresponding ones in which the main constituent of the core was oxygen .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to the precise value of the rather uncertain diffusion coefficient has also been explored .",
    "finally , we have also analyzed the effects of assuming that the white dwarf instead of crystallizing at low temperatures experiences a transition to a glassy state .",
    "all in all , we have found that the sedimentation of @xmath0ne has notable consequences in the evolutionary timescales of white dwarfs .",
    "the associated energy release notably delays the cooling of white dwarfs .",
    "the precise value of the delay depends on the adopted diffusion coefficient , on the mass of the white dwarf , on the core composition and on the possibility that white dwarfs experience a transition to a glassy state .",
    "the delay is larger for more massive white dwarfs and for carbon - rich cores .",
    "specifically , for the case of an efficient diffusion the delay introduced in the @xmath124 carbon - rich sequence is @xmath125 gyr at @xmath126 whereas it only amounts to 0.6 gyr in the case of the oxygen - rich sequence . in low - mass white dwarfs , appreciable delays in the cooling rates",
    "take place but only at much smaller luminosities .",
    "these results are in relative good agreement with the results of deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) , although we find that the delays obtained here are somewhat larger .    to qualitatively assess the effect of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the white dwarf luminosity function , we have derived individual luminosity functions from our cooling curves .",
    "the number of white dwarfs of a given mass is proportional to the characteristic cooling time , @xmath127 .",
    "we plot this quantity in fig .",
    "[ lf_c ] for the 1.06 and @xmath128 white dwarf cooling sequences with carbon - rich cores as a function of the surface luminosity . the characteristic cooling times in terms of the effective temperature for the @xmath88 white dwarf cooling sequences with carbon- and oxygen - rich cores are shown in fig .",
    "[ lf_teff_106 ] . in both figures",
    ", the solid line corresponds to the case in which @xmath0ne diffusion is not considered and the remaining curves to the cases of different diffusion assumptions , indicated in the legend . at large luminosities",
    "the signature of the accelerated evolution due to neutrino losses is clearly noticeable in the characteristic cooling times . at the extreme faint end of the luminosity range ,",
    "the sharp decline in the luminosity function in the massive sequences reflects the onset of debye cooling , stage which is reached at different ages depending on the assumption about diffusion .",
    "note that the effect of @xmath0ne diffusion in the characteristic cooling times of low - mass white dwarfs with solar metallicity progenitors is barely noticeable . in sharp contrast , it is significative in the case of massive white dwarfs .",
    "in fact , depending on the internal composition and the uncertainties weighting upon the determination of the diffusion coefficient , an increase in the number of white dwarfs by a factor of @xmath129 5 could be expected in the effective temperature range where @xmath0ne diffusion constitutes the main source of stellar luminosity . in the case",
    "that @xmath68 and assuming carbon - rich composition , this increase in the massive white dwarf population would be expected at @xmath130 within 12,000 and 16,000 k. for oxygen - rich cores , only a modest increase is expected at somewhat larger effective temperatures .",
    "if a transition to a glassy state is assumed instead of crystallization , a marked increase in the luminosity function is expected in both carbon- and oxygen - rich massive white dwarfs . in the case of an oxygen - rich core , this increase takes place at the effective temperature range between @xmath129 12,000 and 8,000 k. interestingly enough , a possible large excess in the number of massive white dwarfs has been reported below @xmath131 k ( kleinman et al . 2004 ; liebert et al . 2005 ; kepler et al .",
    "although this increase is believed to be the result of a problem in the line fitting procedure , it might be possible that such an increase in the number of massive white dwarfs could in part be reflecting a decrease in the cooling rate of massive white dwarfs , induced by the gravitational settling of @xmath0ne in the core of these white dwarfs .",
    "for the 1.06 and @xmath112 white dwarf evolutionary sequences with carbon - rich cores as a function of luminosity .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the case in which @xmath0ne diffusion is not considered .",
    "the dotted and dashed lines display the results for @xmath73 and @xmath82 , while the remaining curves correspond to the cases in which the models enter a glassy state . for the latter situation , we show results for @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "only ages smaller than 14 gyr have been considered . ]",
    "the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the white dwarf structure can be assessed from pulsating white dwarfs .",
    "indeed , as shown by deloye & bildsten ( 2002 ) , the abundance gradient in @xmath0ne caused by diffusion in the liquid regions leaves its signature in the brunt - visl frequency which , in turn , modifies the pulsation spectrum of zz ceti stars at levels compared with the uncertainties of the measurements .",
    "more interestingly , pulsating white dwarfs with measured rates of period changes can be used to assess the impact of @xmath0ne sedimentation on the white dwarf cooling directly .",
    "indeed , the delay in the cooling times resulting from the @xmath0ne diffusion is expected to alter the rate of change of the periods of zz  ceti stars .",
    "for a quantitative inference of the possible impact , we write the rate of change of the pulsation period of a pulsating white dwarf as        where @xmath135 is the temperature of the isothermal core and @xmath136 and @xmath137 are constants of order unity which depend on the chemical composition , thicknesses of the hydrogen and helium envelopes , equation of state , and other ingredients involved in the modeling of white dwarfs ( winget et al .",
    "1983 ) . for da white dwarfs in the zz  ceti instability strip , the rate of change due to gravitational contraction , given by the second term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ pdot ] ) , is usually negligible and , thus , the secular rate of change of the period is directely related to the speed of cooling and it is a positive contribution . the rate of secular period change has been measured for some pulsating white dwarfs . for instance , for g117-b15a , an intermediate mass zz  ceti star , kepler et al .",
    "( 2005 ) have derived the secular variation of the main observed period of 215.2  s , @xmath138  s  s@xmath139 , with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "other pulsating white dwarfs  like l  19 - 2 and r  548  have also determinations of the secular rate of period change but are not as accurate as that of g117-b15a .",
    "we find that for the @xmath140 carbon - rich sequence with @xmath68 the predicted period change decreases by a factor of about 1.7 , as compared with the period change in the case that diffusion is not considered .",
    "this result is very preliminary , and an in depth study will be done in a forthcoming publication .    in summary",
    ", although the effect of the sedimentation of @xmath0ne is sizeable its impact on the white dwarf luminosity function should be minor , except for a modest increase in the derived ages , for the most reasonable assumptions .",
    "however , the imprints of the sedimentation of @xmath0ne could be detectable using pulsating white dwarfs in the appropriate effective temperature range with accurately determined rates of change of the observed periods .",
