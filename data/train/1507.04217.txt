    "in the last twenty years increasing evidence has been found for the existence of a supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy .",
    "it is expected that a distant observer should `` see '' this black hole as a dark disk in the sky which is known as the `` shadow '' .",
    "it is sometimes said that the shadow is an image of the event horizon , and the size of the shadow is estimated by the angle under which the observer would see the horizon according to euclidean geometry .",
    "actually , the boundary of the shadow corresponds to light rays that asymptotically approach the photon sphere ( at @xmath0 in the schwarzschild case ) and not the horizon ( at @xmath1 in the schwarzschild case ) .",
    "moreover , light rays do not follow straight lines in euclidean geometry but they are bent .",
    "for these two reasons , the angular diameter of the shadow is actually bigger than the naive euclidean estimate suggests . for the black hole at the center of our galaxy ,",
    "it amounts to about 53 @xmath2as whereas the euclidean estimate gives only about 20 @xmath2as . at present ,",
    "two projects are under way to observe this shadow which would give important information on the compact object at the center of our galaxy .",
    "these projects , which are going to use ( sub)millimeter vlbi observations with radio telescopes distributed over the earth , are the event horizon telescope ( http://eventhorizontelescope.org ) and the blackholecam ( http://blackholecam.org ) .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the shadow is defined as the region of the observer s sky that is left dark if there are light sources distributed everywhere but not between the observer and the black hole . for a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "the shadow is a circular disk . for a schwarzschild black hole",
    "the angular diameter of the shadow was calculated , as a function of the mass of the black hole and of the radius coordinate where the observer is situated , by synge @xcite .",
    "( synge did not use the word `` shadow '' .",
    "he calculated what he called the `` escape cones '' of light .",
    "however , the complement of the opening angle of the escape cone at the observer gives exactly the diameter of the shadow . ) for a rotating black hole the shadow is no longer circular .",
    "the first to correctly calculate the shape of the shadow of a kerr black hole was bardeen  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the shape and the size of the shadow can be calculated analytically for the whole class of plebaski - demiaski spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "all these calculations are based on the assumption that light propagates along lightlike geodesics , without being influenced directly by matter .",
    "if such an influence is to be taken into account , one usually resorts to numerical calculation .",
    "in particular , falcke , melia and agol @xcite have numerically simulated the visual appearance of the black hole at the center of our galaxy , assuming that it is a kerr black hole , with scattering and the presence of emission regions between the observer and the black hole taken into account ( at 0.6 and 1.3 mm wavelengths ) .",
    "sophisticated ray tracing programs have been written for producing realistic images of a black hole surrounded by an accretion disk , e.g. for the movie _ interstellar_. the numerical techniques used for this movie are described in detail , along with a review of earlier work , by james et al .",
    "@xcite .    while the purely geometric calculation of the shadow can be done analytically , at least for spacetimes",
    "in which the equation for lightlike geodesics is completely integrable , virtually all of the work that takes the influence of matter into account was based on numerics so far . in this paper",
    "we want to take the first steps towards an investigation of the shadow in matter based on analytical calculations .",
    "it is clear that this can be done only for highly idealized situations , but nonetheless we think that it is worthwile to do so .",
    "in contrast to numerical simulations , which can depict the situation only for a particular choice of the parameters involved , analytical results demonstrate how exactly an effect depends on these parameters and they bring out the general features more clearly .",
    "also , analytical results are useful for testing numerical codes . in this paper",
    "we begin with the simplest non - trivial case : we want to analytically calculate the influence of a non - magnetized pressure - less plasma on the size of the shadow of a non - rotating black hole .",
    "a plasma is a dispersive medium , i.e. , the light rays deviate from lightlike geodesics in a way that depends on the frequency .",
    "the hamiltonian for the light rays can be derived from maxwell s equations where the source of the electromagnetic field consists of two charged fluids , one modelling the ions and the other the electrons . for a plasma on a curved background ,",
    "the transition from maxwell s equations to ray optics has to be done by a two - scale method .",
    "a rigorous derivation of the hamiltonian for light rays was provided by breuer and ehlers @xcite who considered a magnetized pressure - less plasma . for the much simpler case of a non - magnetized pressure - less plasma",
    ", a similar derivation can be found in perlick @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the equation of light rays can be fully characterized by a scalar , i.e. direction - independent , index of refraction which is a function of the spacetime point and of the frequency .",
    "then the resulting equation of motion for light rays belongs to a class that was studied in the text - book by synge @xcite .",
    "the resulting formula for the deflection angle of light in a plasma whose density is a function of the radius coordinate was calculated in the schwarzschild spacetime ( and more generally in the equatorial plane of the kerr metric ) by perlick @xcite .",
    "the same result was found and further discussed by bisnovatyi - kogan and tsupko @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "morozova et al .",
    "@xcite generalized the calculation to the kerr metric off the equatorial plane , assuming that the black hole is slowly rotating . for recent suggestions of how the effects of a plasma on light rays",
    "could actually be observed we refer to er and mao @xcite and to rogers @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the angular diameter of the shadow for a non - rotating black hole that is surrounded by a non - magnetized pressure - less plasma .",
    "although we are mainly interested in the schwarzschild case , in large parts of the paper we work in an unspecified spherically symmetric and static spacetime , so the results can be applied , e.g. , also to charged black holes or to wormholes .    in our work",
    "the plasma manifests itself as a refractive and dispersive medium , which leads to a change of the light rays in comparison with vacuum . as a result , the geometrical size of the shadow",
    "is changed .",
    "we do not take into account the processes of absorption and scattering of the photons by plasma electrons .",
    "also , we neglect the gravitational field of the plasma particles .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : eom ] we work out the equation of motion for light rays in a plasma on a spherically symmetric and static spacetime . in section [ sec : circular ] we determine the circular light orbits which are of crucial relevance for the formation of the shadow . in section",
    "[ sec : shadow ] we calculate the angular diameter of the shadow .",
    "we specify the results in section [ sec : thin ] to the case of a low - density plasma and in section [ sec : accretion ] to the case that the plasma has the particular density profile that corresponds to spherically symmetric accretion of a dust onto a schwarzschild black hole . in the same section",
    "we also discuss the perspectives of actually observing the influence of a plasma on the shadow of a supermassive black hole .",
    "we use units such that @xmath3 , so the schwarzschild radius is @xmath4 .",
    "our choice of signature is @xmath5 .",
    "we use einstein s summation convention for latin indices which take the values @xmath6",
    "@xmath7 @xmath8 .",
    "we consider a spherically symmetric and static metric @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are positive .",
    "we are mainly interested in the case of a schwarzschild black hole but for the time being there is no need for specifying the metric any further .",
    "we assume that the spacetime is filled with a non - magnetized cold plasma whose electron plasma frequency @xmath13 is a function of the radius coordinate only , @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the charge of the electron , @xmath16 is the electron mass , and @xmath17 is the number density of the electrons in the plasma .",
    "the refraction index @xmath18 of this plasma depends on the radius coordinate @xmath19 and on the frequency @xmath20 of the photon as it is measured by a static observer , @xmath21 because of the spherical symmetry we may restrict to the equatorial plane @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "then the hamiltonian for light rays in the plasma reads @xmath24 @xmath25 for a derivation of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) from maxwell s equations with a two - fluid source we refer to the literature given in the introduction .",
    "the light rays are the solutions to hamilton s equations @xmath26 which in this case read @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 with @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 here a dot means differentiation with respect to an affine parameter @xmath35 , and a prime means differentiation with respect to @xmath19 .",
    "> from ( [ eq : ham1 ] ) and ( [ eq : ham2 ] ) it follows that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are constants of motion .",
    "we write @xmath38 . if @xmath39 has been fixed and if @xmath40 for @xmath41 , which is the case if the spacetime is asymptotically flat , the frequency @xmath20 measured by a static observer becomes a function of @xmath19 by the gravitational redshift formula , @xmath42 by ( [ eq : h0 ] ) , a light ray with constant of motion @xmath39 is restricted to the region where @xmath43 the restriction ( [ eq : restr ] ) physically means that the photon frequency at a given point , @xmath44 , must be bigger than the plasma frequency , @xmath45 , at the same point .",
    "this is always true for light propagation in a plasma .    to derive the orbit equation , we use ( [ eq : ham5 ] ) and ( [ eq : ham6 ] ) to find @xmath46 upon substituting for @xmath47 from ( [ eq : h0 ] ) , this results in @xmath48 where we have defined the function @xmath49 in general , the orbit has to be decomposed into sections where @xmath19 is increasing as a function of @xmath50 and sections where it is decreasing , and the sign in ( [ eq : drdphi2 ] ) has to be chosen appropriately . for a light ray that comes in from infinity ,",
    "reaches a minimum at a radius @xmath51 , and goes out to infinity again , integration over the orbit gives the formula for the bending angle , @xmath52 , @xmath53 as @xmath51 corresponds to the turning point of the trajectory , the condition @xmath54 has to hold .",
    "this equation relates @xmath51 to the constant of motion @xmath55 , @xmath56 then the deflection angle can be rewritten as a function of only @xmath51 and @xmath57 ( for a given plasma distribution ) as @xmath58    _ example @xmath59 : schwarzschild spacetime _    for the schwarzschild spacetime , @xmath60 the function @xmath61 specifies to @xmath62 then the bending angle reads @xmath63 this formula for the bending angle in a plasma on schwarzschild spacetime was derived in @xcite . in @xcite it was rederived using synge s approach and rewritten in terms of an elliptic integral for a homogeneous plasma ; there also the strong deflection limit ( @xmath64 ) was investigated .    _",
    "example @xmath65 : ellis wormhole _    as a second example we choose the ellis wormhole @xcite which is a traversible wormhole of the morris - thorne class @xcite .",
    "it is true that the existence of such wormholes is questionable because they need exotic matter @xcite and , at least for a certain kind of perturbations , it has been shown that the ellis wormhole is unstable @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "wormholes have met with great interest because they make time travel possible and the ellis wormhole is an instructive example for illustrating the applicability of our results . in this case",
    "the metric coefficients are @xmath66 where the coordinate @xmath19 ranges from @xmath67 to @xmath68 and @xmath69 is a constant that determines the radius of the `` neck '' of the wormhole .",
    "note that this is an example of a spherically symmetric and static spacetime where we can not make a transformation of the radius coordinate , @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 .",
    "the reason is that the function @xmath12 has vanishing derivative at @xmath72 ( i.e. , at the `` neck '' ) , so the desired transformation fails to be a good coordinate transformation on any radius interval that contains the point @xmath72 . for the ellis",
    "wormhole the function @xmath61 reads @xmath73 and the bending angle is given by @xmath74",
    "we now derive the condition for cicular light orbits which will be crucial for determining the shadow . along a circular light orbit we must have @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",

    "any solution @xmath87 of ( [ eq : circ8 ] ) determines the radius of a _",
    "photon sphere_. if a light ray starts tangentially to such a sphere it will stay on a circular path with radius @xmath88 forever . if the spacetime is asymptotically flat , and if @xmath89 for @xmath41 , the outermost photon sphere is always unstable with respect to radial perturbations .",
    "this means that the circular photon orbits in this photon sphere can serve as limit curves for light rays that approach them asymptotically .",
    "the radius @xmath88 of the outermost photon sphere is the critical value of the minimal radius @xmath51 mentioned above .",
    "if a light ray comes in from infinity and reaches a minimum radius @xmath51 bigger than @xmath88 , it will go out to infinity again .",
    "the case @xmath90 corresponds to a light ray that spirals asymptotically towards a circular photon orbit in the sphere of radius @xmath88 .",
    "all other rays cross the photon sphere and we exclude the case that they can come back .",
    "the latter case can occur only if there is a second photon sphere .    in the vacuum case , @xmath91 , the condition for a circular light orbit in an unspecified spherically symmetric and static spacetime",
    "was first given by atkinson @xcite .",

    "however , in an inhomogeneous plasma there may be arbitrarily many photon spheres . for an observer at a large positive @xmath19 coordinate ,",
    "the outermost photon sphere is relevant for the formation of the shadow which will be discussed in the next section .",

    "[ fig : shadow ] . consider light rays sent from an observer at radius coordinate @xmath102 into the past . as we want to take the influence of a plasma into account , by a light ray we mean a solution to the equations of motion discussed in section  [ sec : eom ] .",
    "these light rays can be divided into two classes : light rays of the first class go to infinity after being deflected by the black hole .",
    "light rays of the second class go towards the horizon of the black hole .",
    "if we assume that there are no light sources between the observer and the black hole , initial directions of the second class correspond to darkness on the observer s sky .",
    "this dark circular disk on the observer s sky is called the _ shadow _ of the black hole .",
    "the boundary of the shadow is determined by the initial directions of light rays that asymptotically spiral towards the outermost photon sphere .",
    "here it is crucial that the light rays in the photon sphere are unstable with respect to radial perturbations because otherwise they could not serve as limit curves .",
    "for this reason , the construction of the shadow works for any spherically symmetric and static spacetime that admits an unstable photon sphere .",
    "this includes not only black holes but also , e.g. , wormholes .",
    "we have already mentioned that in a spherically symmetric and static spacetime that is asymptotically flat the outermost photon sphere is always unstable , provided that the plasma density tends to zero for @xmath41 .",

    "we obtain for the correction due to the presence of the plasma : @xmath201 note that the circular frequency @xmath57 is connected with the ordinary frequency @xmath202 by the usual relation , @xmath203 , and that in the expression for @xmath204 we can assume , as a valid approximation , that @xmath39 is related to the wavelength @xmath205 by the vacuum relation @xmath206 .",
    "the value of @xmath200 depends on the specific model of accretion . for estimations",
    "we consider @xmath207 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) and @xmath208 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the galactic center source sgr a*. for estimations we put @xmath209 , @xmath210 kpc ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "then synge s formula ( [ eq : sssh ] ) gives for the angular radius of the shadow in vacuum a value of @xmath211 @xmath2as , i.e. , a diameter of about 53 @xmath2as which is expected to be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) soon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "by contrast , a naive euclidean estimate of the horizon size , @xmath212 , yields @xmath213as , i.e. , a diameter of about 20 @xmath2as , as was already mentioned in the introduction . for a rotating ( kerr )",
    "black hole , the shadow is flattened on one side , but its vertical diameter is still given by synge s formula if @xmath214 , see @xcite .",
    "for estimating the correction @xmath204 we use @xmath215 ( see , for example @xcite ) . for @xmath216 mm",
    "we obtain : @xmath217 note that observations of the shadow are planned in the ( sub)millimeter regime because at wavelengths of more than about 1.3 mm it is expected that the shadow is washed out by scattering @xcite .",
    "we see that in this regime the effect of a plasma is rather small , for the chosen values of @xmath200",
    ". however , for bigger radio wavelengths the effect can be significant .",
    "for @xmath218 cm we obtain : @xmath219",
    "we now turn to the galactic center source m87 . for estimations we put @xmath220 , @xmath221 mpc , @xmath222 ergs s@xmath223 ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "then synge s formula leads to an angular radius of the shadow in vacuum of @xmath224 @xmath2as .",
    "for @xmath216 mm we obtain : @xmath225 for @xmath226 cm we obtain : @xmath227",
    "in this paper the first steps towards an investigation of the shadow in the presence of matter based on analytical calculations have been taken .",
    "we have analytically calculated the influence of a non - magnetized pressure - less plasma on the angular size of the shadow .",
    "it was our goal to derive all relevant formulas for an unspecified spherically symmetric and static spacetime , before specializing to the case of a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "the gravitational field was not supposed to be weak .",
    "we have worked in the frame - work of geometrical optics ; in this approximation the presence of the plasma leads to a change of the geometrical size of the shadow via a change of the light rays in this medium .",
    "the equation of motion for light rays in a plasma with a spherically symmetric density distribution on a spherically symmetric and static spacetime ( [ eq : g ] ) has been derived , see ( [ eq : drdphi2 ] ) . in particular , the formula for the photon deflection angle has been shown for unbound orbits , see ( [ eq : defl ] ) .",
    "we have also found the radii of the circular light orbits ( radii of the photon spheres ) , see ( [ eq : circ8 ] ) .",
    "the central result of our paper is an analytical formula for the angular size of the shadow , see ( [ eq : shadow ] ) .. ]    special attention was given to the realistic case when the plasma frequency is much smaller than the photon frequency , see section [ sec : thin ] .",
    "we have shown that in this case the plasma has a decreasing effect on the size of the shadow provided that the plasma density is higher at the photon sphere than at the observer position , see ( [ eq : shepsilon ] ) .",
    "in particular , a simple formula for the size of the shadow was presented for the case of a power - law density distribution and an observer at a large distance , see ( [ eq : shadow - distant ] ) .    in the presence of a plasma",
    "the size of the shadow depends on the wavelength at which the observation is made , in contrast to the vacuum case where it is the same for all wavelengths . for the underlying spacetime we have treated two examples , the schwarzschild black hole and the ellis wormhole . in particular ,",
    "the case of spherically symmetric accretion of plasma onto a schwarzschild black hole was considered in detail , see section [ sec : accretion ] .",
    "we have found that for an observer far away from the schwarzschild black hole the plasma makes the shadow smaller . as examples , we have considered sgr a * and m87 . for the specific accretion model used here we have found that the effect of the presence of a plasma on the size of the shadow can be significant only for wavelengths of at least a few centimeters . at such wavelengths the observation of the shadow is made difficult because of scattering .",
    "apart from considering more complicated plasma models , an obvious next step would be to generalize the analysis to the case of axially symmetric and stationary situations to include rotating black holes .",
    "then the shadow is no longer circular , and the plasma has an effect not only on its size but also on its shape .",
