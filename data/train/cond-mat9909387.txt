    "in recent years significant study has been given to the microscopic theory of non  equilibrium thermodynamic systems with quenched disorder that reveal non  ergodic behavior and exhibit memory effects .",
    "spin glasses  @xcite and random heteropolymers  @xcite , that received the most of attention , provide the well known examples of such systems .",
    "procedure of the averaging over disorder is at the heart of theoretical approaches developed for the description of the systems .",
    "thus the bulk of static theories are based on the replica method firstly introduced in  @xcite or employ the methods of random matrix theory ( rmt ) ( see  @xcite for review ) .",
    "in addition , the powerful supersymmetry approach by efetov  @xcite , where generating functional describing statistics of the density of states is mapped on the nonlinear supermatrix @xmath0model , has had rmt as a key ingredient of its development .",
    "the starting point of dynamical theories is stochastic dynamics defined in terms of the corresponding stochastic equations .",
    "a wide range of problems can be formulated in such a way : kinetics of ordering  @xcite , non  equilibrium dynamics of spin  glass systems  @xcite and so on .",
    "when the stochastic dynamics is governed by langevin equations , the generating functional of the stochastic problem can be written as a functional integral  @xcite ( mrs formalism ) thus allowing for the averaging over disorder at the very beginning of calculations .",
    "it has led to the field theoretic formulation of the problem , so one could take advantage of using the machinery of the field theory .",
    "the theory is known can represented in the supersymmetric form that reveals hidden supersymmetry ( susy ) of the stochastic problem  @xcite .    in this paper susy formalism in the superfield representation",
    "is employed to study ergodicity breaking transition in the model thermodynamic system with quenched disorder .",
    "it implies that generating functional of langevin dynamical system is represented as functional integral over superfields with euclidean action by means of introducing grassmann anticommuting variables .",
    "these variables and their products serve as a basis for superfields which components include grassmann fields in addition to the usual real  valued fields .",
    "the correlation functions of the superfields ( supercorrelators ) then encode physically relevant information on observables in components of the correlators that are the autocorrelator of the order parameter field @xmath1 and the response functions @xmath2 ( advanced and retarded green functions ) .",
    "the analysis is based on a system of dynamical dyson equations supplemented with the equations for averaged order parameter provided the distribution of quenched random variables is not symmetric .",
    "it was pointed out in  @xcite that , in the mode  coupling approximation , the dyson equations can be regarded as euler ",
    "lagrange equations for the functional of supercorrelators known as dynamical action and this functional bears striking similarity with the replica expression for the free energy .    in our study",
    "the dynamical action is shown to be a second legendre transformation  @xcite of the free energy .",
    "so , it depends on both averaged order parameter and two  time correlation functions and can be calculated on the basis of suitably defined diagrammatics .",
    "on the technical side , since algebraic structure of the superfield representation is directly related to the underlying symmetry , we have the reduction of the number of diagrams to be taken into consideration in the perturbation theory . from the other hand ,",
    "susy formalism allows ergodicity breaking transition be interpreted as a dynamical symmetry breaking transition .",
    "indeed , in the susy language , the well  known `` causality '' condition and fluctuation  dissipation theorem ( fdt ) immediately follow from the corresponding ward identities  @xcite . below the critical temperature fdt and time translational invariance",
    "are dynamically violated that result in the appearance of anomalous solutions to the dyson equations . in particular , the latter include the case , where the system being in a non  ergodic state is characterized by a very slow relaxation .",
    "this phenomenon is known as aging and , as it has been demonstrated for a number of solvable models  @xcite , the effect is a consequence of trapping in metastable attractors .    in this article , leaving aside detailed study of aging , we shall perform asymptotic and stability analysis of dynamical dyson equations to characterize the transition in terms of asymptotic quantities such as adiabatic and isothermal susceptibilities , memory and field induced parameters .",
    "this approach is applied to the simple model of thermodynamic system with quenched external field and two body interaction .",
    "note that the second legendre transformation technique plays the unifying role in this theory , so that the susy based theory can be directly employed for the study of ergodicity breaking transitions in different disordered systems such as random heteropolymers  @xcite and filled nematic liquid crystals  @xcite .",

    "dependencies of @xmath7 and the temperature of freezing transition , where the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to temperature diverges , @xmath237 on the disorder intensity @xmath230 at @xmath184 are shown in fig .",
    "as is seen , the difference @xmath238 goes to zero when @xmath230 increases .",
    "the latter is not very surprising , for @xmath239 at @xmath240 and the rescaled intensity @xmath230 increases indefinitely when @xmath241 . as is shown in fig .  3 , dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath199 , that is proportional to @xmath242",
    ", reveals more complicated non - monotonous behavior at @xmath230 just above its critical value .",
    "the critical temperature becomes an increasing function of the random field intensity at sufficiently large  @xmath230 .    in solving the equations ( [ eq:55],[eq:57 ] ) one has to handle nonuniqueness of the solutions .",
    "for example , changing the sign of the radical in the expression for the critical temperature at @xmath184 ( [ eq:67 ] ) gives another solution that corresponds to the nonphysical branch and has wrong behavior , @xmath243 , in the limit @xmath241 .",
    "note that choosing this branch gives another physically absurd result that @xmath4 grows as temperature increases at @xmath186 .",
    "let us summarize the results of the paper .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical action of thermodynamic system with quenched disorder can be calculated as a second legendre transformation of the effective free energy functional . despite the technique",
    "was employed to study the disordered system in the mean field approximation , it can be equally applied for consideration of fluctuational effects when going beyond the scope of the mean field theory . from the other hand , owing to the reflection symmetry of the system , @xmath244 , we have eliminated @xmath146 from the considerations concerning the ergodicity breaking transitions in the case of symmetric distribution of quenched variables .",
    "clearly , when the distribution is nonsymmetric or @xmath245 ( the presence of cubic anharmonicity ) , @xmath246 and the dynamical action contains the terms dependent on the averaged order parameter .",
    "( [ eq:44 ] ) then give coupled equations for the order parameter and correlation functions .",
    "the method is applied for the study of @xmath247 model of thermodynamic system with quenched couplings and external field written in the site representation .",
    "asymptotics of correlator is found to be affected by the random static field",
    ". it is characterized by the field induced parameter @xmath4 which is a decreasing function of temperature at @xmath186 .",
    "discussion at the end of sec .  4 led us to the conclusion that the difference between the memory parameter @xmath10 and @xmath4 plays the role of an order parameter , so that adiabatic and isothermal susceptibilities differ if @xmath248 .",
    "numerical analysis reveals that using the system ( [ eq:54 ] ) below @xmath7 would predict discontinuity of the susceptibility at the critical point .",
    "much more reasonable results can be obtained in the case of weak ergodicity breaking .",
    "so aging plays an important part in dynamics of the system below critical point .",
    "recently reported results  @xcite for heteropolymers support the conclusion .",
    "in the bulk of the paper the solutions under investigation are casual . in general , this is not the case .",
    "an instanton motion , where both initial and final boundary conditions need to be fixed , provides an important example of this kind . in this appendix",
    "we show that the mapping , recently introduced in  @xcite , between the uphill motion related to an instanton and the corresponding downhill motion going back in time can be constructed by making use of susy formalism .",
    "let us define the transformation of superfields as follows : @xmath249 where @xmath250 inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) into the action ( [ eq:8],[eq:9 ] ) integrated from @xmath251 to @xmath252 gives the expression in terms of superfields @xmath253          it remains to notice that fdt is invariant under the action of the transformation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) followed by the inversion of time @xmath259 , so the lagrangian @xmath260 describes normal downhill motion formally inverted in time .",
    "the resulting relations ( [ eq : a5 ] ) are identical with those derived in  @xcite and enable calculating of the green function for the instanton process provided that the corresponding causal solutions are known .",
