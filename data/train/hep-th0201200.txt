    "research into the mathematical properties and physical meaning of topological defects in relativistic field theory has increased sharply since the mid seventies of the twentieth century .",
    "there has also been a parallel development in ( non - relativistic ) condensed matter physics .",
    "extended states and phase transitions - e.g. type ii superconductivity- are related to the appearance of such exotic phenomena .",
    "domain wall defects in the real world can be thought of as solitary waves propagating in a @xmath0-dimensional universe that self - repeat in the remaining two dimensions .",
    "thus , investigations on kink nature and behaviour in @xmath1 or sine - gordon models inform us about the properties of the simplest type of topological defect .",
    "realistic theories , however , involve more than one scalar field and the study of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xmath2-scalar fields models in this respect is not only worthwhile but almost mandatory .",
    "examples of theories with @xmath3 , where one might be interested in looking at topological defects , include the linear sigma model , the ginzburg - landau theory of phase transitions , the supersymmetric wess - zumino model , susy qcd , etcetera .",
    "kinks are time - independent finite - energy solutions of the field equations that have been thoroughly investigated in the @xmath4 case , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "much less is known about the kink variety in systems with two or more scalar fields ( the reason for this is also clearly explained in @xcite ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , there are exceptions :    * a deformation of the linear @xmath5-sigma model , christened in the literature as the @xmath6 model , exhibits a rich variety of kinks . the characteristics of any of these kink defects as well as the structure of the variety as a whole have been elucidated in a long series of papers , see references [ 2 - 12 ] .",
    "the moduli space of kinks in an analogous deformation of the linear @xmath7-sigma model has also been fully described in @xcite . *",
    "the search for kinks is tantamount to the solving of a mechanical problem , which is seldom solvable if @xmath8 . in @xcite",
    "we described the kinks of two @xmath9 field - theoretical models associated with completely integrable mechanical systems ; i.e. , the same idea that works in the @xmath6 model and its @xmath10 generalization . * in @xcite ,",
    "the kinks of the wess - zumino model are shown to be given by certain real algebraic curves in the complex plane .",
    "another favorable situation occurs when the field - theoretical model is the bosonic sector of a supersymmetric system .",
    "this is the case of the wess - zumino system and also happens in a @xmath9 model proposed in @xcite , which has been discussed and applied to describe several interesting physical contexts in the series of papers [ 16 - 25 ] . throughout their work ,",
    "bazeia et al .",
    "identify only two kinds of kinks : a topological one , with only the first component non - null , usually termed as the @xmath11 kink , and a second topological kink that has both components non - null and is called the @xmath12 kink .",
    "in contrast with the mstb model , where the @xmath11 kinks are unstable , @xcite-@xcite , and decay to the @xmath12 kinks , @xcite , in the system of bazeia et al . there is an interesting phenomenon of kink degeneracy : the @xmath11 and @xmath12 kinks have the same classical energy .",
    "the main result to be shown in this paper is that the kink degeneracy is a continuous one rather than the discrete degeneracy implicit in [ 16 - 25 ] .",
    "we shall find a continuous family of kink solutions to the classical field equations , all of them degenerated in energy with the @xmath11 and @xmath12 kinks .",
    "the existence of this variety of kinks is possible because of the spontaneous breaking of a discrete internal symmetry group .",
    "the quotient of the kink variety by the symmetry group is the kink moduli space , a structure parallel to the moduli spaces of gauge theoretical topological defects as vortices , @xcite , or magnetic monopoles , @xcite .",
    "identification of the kink variety is achieved through the solution of first - order , rather than second - order , field equations . in ( 1 + 1)-dimensional scalar field theories ,",
    "first - order equations are available if , modulo a global sign , a superpotential is found .",
    "note that the search for a superpotential is highly non - trivial if @xmath8 .",
    "bazeia et al .",
    ", however , proposed a continuously differentiable superpotential in their model , which in turn guarantees the stability of any finite energy solution of the associated first - order system of equations through the classical bogomoly - prasad - sommerfield argument , @xcite .",
    "the existence of the superpotential tells us that we can understand the system as the bosonic sector of an @xmath13 ( 1 + 1)-dimensional supersymmetric field theory , in which the kinks play a significant r@xmath14le as bps states .",
    "we shall analyze the supersymmetric extension of this model in a future work , but we observe that the dimension of the kink moduli space in this system is such that the index introduced in @xcite is zero , showing that the soliton supermultiplets are long or reducible .",
    "all the foregoing statements are valid for any value of the single classically relevant coupling constant in the model . in this paper",
    "we shall show another new result : for certain values of the coupling constant there exists a second superpotential .",
    "accordingly , a second system of first - order equations is available that also admits kink solutions , although the old and new solitons belong to different topological sectors of the configuration space . for the critical values where the second superpotential is found , there are two non - equivalent supersymmetric extensions of the same bosonic sector .    for most of the critical values",
    "the second superpotential fails to be continuously differentiable at a finite number of points in the @xmath15 internal space . in these cases , the second bogomoly bound is not a topological quantity ; it also depends on the values of the superpotential at the points where it is not differentiable .",
    "kink orbits that cross those points are unstable and are solutions of the first - order equations only in one interval , not on the whole spatial line .",
    "nevertheless , these kinks are solutions of the second - order equations .    a final comment : in concordance with the lifting of the kink translational degeneracy",
    ", we expect that the kink internal degeneracy will be removed in second - order in the loop expansion of the energy in the quantum theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sections  2 and  3 we introduce the bnrt model discussed in @xcite and identify a one - parametric family of kinks , which includes the tk1 and tk2 kinks , as bps solutions . in sections  4 and  5",
    "we investigate the existence of a second decomposition  la bogomolnyi .",
    "we find that this is possible for certain values of the coupling constant , for which we discover a second kink family .",
    "in the model introduced in @xcite by bazeia , nascimento , ribeiro and toledo , henceforth referred to as the bnrt model , the scalar field is built from two components @xmath16 and the dynamics is governed by the action @xmath17&=&\\int d^2 y \\left [ \\sum_{a=1}^2\\partial_\\mu \\chi_a \\partial^\\mu \\chi_a- \\bar{u}(\\chi_1,\\chi_2 )   \\right ] \\label{eq : action}\\\\\\bar{u}(\\chi_1 , \\chi_2)&= & \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda^2 ( \\chi_1 ^ 2-a^2)^2 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\lambda \\mu ( \\chi_1 ^ 2-a^2 ) \\chi_2 ^ 2+\\frac{1}{8 } \\mu^2 \\chi_2 ^ 4 + \\frac{1}{2 } \\mu^2 \\chi_1 ^ 2 \\chi_2 ^ 2 \\label{eq : dimpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coupling constants with dimensions of inverse length and @xmath20 is a non - dimensional parameter .",

    "we shall focus our attention on the @xmath35 regime , where the vacuum manifold is : @xmath36 the action of @xmath37 on @xmath38 is summarized as follows : @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , @xmath38 can be seen as the union of two disjoint vacuum orbits : @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the vacuum moduli space @xmath44 is a set of two elements , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath48 symmetry of the action ( [ eq : action ] ) is spontaneously broken to the @xmath49 subgroup on the elements in the @xmath50 orbit and to the @xmath51 subgroup on the vacua of the @xmath52 orbit .    because of the degeneracy and the discreteness of the vacuum manifold @xmath38 , the configuration space is the union of sixteen topologically disconnected sectors . keeping in mind the symmetries of the model , we identify the non - trivial topological sectors as the _ aa _ topological sector ( formed by configurations of @xmath53 that join the @xmath54 and @xmath55 vacua ) ; the _ bb _ topological sector ( configurations that connect the @xmath56 and @xmath57 vacua ) , and the @xmath58 sector ( formed by configurations joining one vacuum in the @xmath50 orbit with another vacuum in the @xmath52 orbit ) .",

    "note that the orbit ( [ eq : trabaze ] ) gives kink curves only in the @xmath66 range because if @xmath67 it becomes a hyperbole that does not connect the vacua .",
    "moreover , ( [ eq : tk2 ] ) describes four different kinks according to the choices of the signs and one can obtain one from another by using the spatial parity and internal reflection symmetries .",
    "the existence of one - component topological kinks -unnoticed in the literature about the model- in the bb topological sectors is obvious .",
    "the * tk1*@xmath68 kink :    third , we try the orbit @xmath69 in the second - order field equations ( [ eq : ecuseg ] ) .",
    "we immediately find that the finite energy solutions @xmath70 are the kinks that connect the @xmath56 and @xmath57 vacua .",
    "in [ 16 - 25 ] the authors propose a superpotential for the model : @xmath71    the classical bps states satisfy the system of first - order equations @xmath72 which are easier to solve than ( [ eq : ecuseg ] ) .",
    "the superpotential @xmath73 is a smooth function of the fields @xmath74 and @xmath75 at each point in @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , according to the bogomolnyi arrangement @xmath30=\\int dx \\sum_{a=1}^2 \\left ( \\frac{d \\phi^a}{d x}-\\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\phi^a } \\right)^2+\\int \\frac{\\partial w}{\\partial \\phi^a } \\frac{d \\phi^a}{dx}\\ ] ] we have that @xmath76=t[\\phi]=|w(\\phi_1(\\infty),\\phi_2(\\infty))-w(\\phi_1(-\\infty),\\phi_2(-\\infty))|\\ ] ] for all solutions of ( [ eq : trabaz ] ) and the kink energy only depends on the topological sector of the solution .",
    "the kink solutions of ( [ eq : trabaz ] ) are the flow - lines of @xmath77 that start and end at elements of @xmath38 .",
    "it happens that @xmath54 and @xmath55 are respectively maxima and minima of @xmath78 and that there are flow - lines of @xmath77 starting at @xmath54 and ending at @xmath55 ( or vice - versa ) .",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 , however , are saddle points of @xmath78 , see figure 1",
    ". therefore , there are no flow - lines of @xmath77 between @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( or vice - versa )",
    ". nevertheless , flow - lines of @xmath77 between one point in the @xmath50 orbit and another point in the @xmath52 orbit ( or vice - versa ) are possible .",

    "thus , they provide a kink family in the topological sector _",
    "aa_. henceforth , we refer to these kinks as * tk2*@xmath90 .",
    "a fixed value of @xmath87 determines four members in the kink variety related amongst one another by spatial parity and internal reflections .",
    "the kink moduli space is defined as the quotient of the kink variety by the action of the symmetry group : @xmath91 the real open half - line parametrized by @xmath87 .",
    "one sees that @xmath92 i.e. the @xmath93 kink is the @xmath94 member of the family ( if @xmath95 ) and the @xmath96 kink is not strictly included although it does appear at the boundary of @xmath97 . * in the range @xmath98 , equation ( [ eq : traba1 ] ) describes open curves and no vacua are connected .",
    "these @xmath99 flow - lines are infinite energy solutions that do not belong to the configuration space @xmath53 , see figure 2 .",
    "* at the other point of the boundary of @xmath100 , @xmath101 , we find the @xmath102 kinks , which are the separatrices between bounded and unbounded motion and the envelop of all kink orbits in the _ aa _ topological sector , see figure 2 .",
    "we briefly discuss the @xmath103 case .",
    "the @xmath104 case is not interesting because the @xmath75 dependence disappears in the potential : it is a direct sum \" of an @xmath4 @xmath105 model and an @xmath4 free model .",

    "the separatrices are placed on the edges of the above mentioned square @xmath129 .",
    "the kink trajectories in the _ aa _ topological sector form a dense family of curves enveloped by the kink orbits in the _ ab _ sector .",
    "see figure 3 .",
    "a rotation of @xmath130 in @xmath15 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 , shows that for this value of @xmath29 the system is non - coupled : @xmath133 .",
