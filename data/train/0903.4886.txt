    "over the past few years , experiments at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have established that a dense partonic medium is formed in @xmath7collisions at @xmath8=200  gev  @xcite .",
    "this medium thermalizes very quickly  @xcite , is extremely opaque to the passage of high-@xmath5particles  @xcite , and the strong coupling of matter in the medium produces a system for which the ratio of shear viscosity to entropy ( @xmath9 ) approaches zero  @xcite .",
    "much of the current focus is on the extraction of key transport and thermodynamic characteristics of the matter produced in these collisions .",
    "measurements of high-@xmath5parton propagation in the medium as well as medium - induced modification of the fragmentation parton spectrum and its products provide a critical tool for probing medium properties .",
    "one of the most striking early results from rhic was the observation of strongly suppressed production of high-@xmath5particles in central au+au events compared to appropriately scaled @xmath10collisions  @xcite .",
    "high-@xmath5partons are formed from hard scattering between the initial colliding partons , and these partons fragment into two or more jets of hadrons .",
    "when propagating through a dense volume of deconfined matter , these high-@xmath5partons are expected to scatter from color charges in the medium , losing energy through a combination of gluon bremsstrahlung radiation and collisional energy transfer to partons in the medium .",
    "these radiated gluons eventually fragment into hadrons at lower @xmath5 , resulting in a depletion of the observed yields of hadrons at higher @xmath5 .    a useful way to quantify the suppression of high-@xmath5hadrons is the nuclear modification factor ( @xmath11 ) where the @xmath10cross section is scaled by the thickness function @xmath12 of the two au nuclei @xmath13 phenix has measured a @xmath4@xmath14close to unity in both peripheral @xmath7collisions and u collisions  @xcite , consistent with the expectation that these collisions would not produce an extended , dense medium .",
    "as the collisions become more central , @xmath14decreases to about 0.2 , indicating a stronger parton energy loss .",
    "furthermore , the measured @xmath4@xmath14is nearly constant as a function of @xmath5 , for @xmath5@xmath15  @xmath16up to the highest currently accessibly @xmath5 , @xmath17  gevc  @xcite .",
    "these data can be well reproduced by models that calculate the energy lost by the hard scattered partons as they traverse the dense medium .",
    "the amount of energy - loss depends on the density of the medium  @xcite , so measurements of high-@xmath5hadron suppression provide constraints on the transport coefficient @xmath18 , a measure of mean transverse momentum squared @xmath19 transferred by the medium to a high - energy parton . however , multiple models with different physical assumptions can reproduce the measured @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "the different models vary widely in how they include the crucial interference terms between multiple - scattering centers as well as the interplay between inelastic , elastic and flavor - changing processes during the parton s passage .    to discriminate between these models we need to increase our experimental control of the path length , since the amount of energy lost by a high-@xmath5parton strongly increases with the distance traveled through the medium .",
    "a quadratic dependence on the path length is predicted for a static medium if the dominant energy - loss mechanism is the bremsstrahlung radiation of gluons surviving the destructive interference caused by multiple scattering  @xcite . for an expanding plasma",
    "the quadratic increase should be moderated to a linear dependence  @xcite .",
    "the centrality dependence of @xmath20 offers a probe of the path - length dependence of partonic energy loss .",
    "however , we can better test the path - length dependence by studying the azimuthal variation of the high-@xmath5suppression at a fixed centrality . since the collision zone has a nearly elliptical shape in the transverse plane due to the non - central overlap of the colliding au nuclei , partons that travel along the short axis of the nuclear overlap region lose less energy and",
    "should therefore be less suppressed .",
    "the key observable is then the two - dimensional modification factor @xmath21 , where @xmath22is the angle of emission with respect to the event plane .",
    "the azimuthal dependence of the spectra can be also parameterized by a fourier expansion , where up to second order @xmath23 $ ] , with @xmath24 being called elliptic flow coefficient . while both quantities characterize azimuthal asymmetries , historically and conceptually they have different roots .",
    "the notion of elliptic flow is primarily tied to lower @xmath0 phenomena ( `` soft physics '' ) , the domain where particle production is proportional to the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath25 ) , and positive @xmath24 arises from the _ boost _ to the mean @xmath0 in the direction where the pressure gradient is highest ( along the reaction plane ) .",
    "conversely , @xmath20 and @xmath21 are commonly used to describe high @xmath0 behavior ( hard scattering , which scales with the number of binary collisions @xmath26 ) . when @xmath11 deviates from unity at high @xmath5 , it becomes a valuable probe of the _ loss _ of energy / momentum in a particular direction .",
    "however , there is no clear separation between soft and hard regions , and both @xmath11 and @xmath24 are well - defined in the entire momentum range , so in this sense @xmath24 is sensitive to differential energy loss at high @xmath5 .",
    "phenix has measured high-@xmath5@xmath27for @xmath4particles from au+au collisions  @xcite .",
    "the energy - loss models that reproduce @xmath20 diverge in their predictions of the azimuthal anisotropy at high @xmath5 .",
    "they generally under - predict the observed azimuthal variation of @xmath28 , or equivalently , are unable to describe the @xmath5dependence of @xmath27over the full range of @xmath5where one would naively expect them to be applicable  @xcite .",
    "these models include the hydrodynamical evolution of the medium , and therefore the high-@xmath5probe loses energy in a medium that is becoming spatially isotropic with time .",
    "several early papers noticed that the measured @xmath24 values were larger than what one would expect from a completely opaque almond - shape collision zone  @xcite .",
    "other early energy - loss calculations came close to reproducing the measured @xmath28  @xcite , but in these the plasma expansion was not taken into account , which resulted in unrealistically strong azimuthal anisotropy .",
    "another calculation  @xcite has reproduced @xmath28 , but in this model the au nuclei were parameterized as hard - spheres instead of using a more realistic woods - saxon density profile , and this mechanism artificially increases the azimuthal dependence of the energy density",
    ".    one potential resolution of the problem with energy loss calculations not reproducing the measured azimuthal dependence of yields is a recent calculation that allowed the high-@xmath5parton to resonantly scatter with the medium  @xcite ( and references therein ) , increasing the energy lost by a parton at plasma densities that correspond to temperatures near the critical temperature .",
    "this produces a sharper dependence of the energy - loss on the spatial variation of the medium s energy density and hence the model is able to simultaneously reproduce both @xmath20 and @xmath28 .",
    "a critical check will be to examine whether the same parameters work for the full range of collision centralities .    in order to discriminate among all the models that attempt to reproduce @xmath21 ,",
    "the experimental challenge is to extend the range and increase the precision of observations which can be used to test different energy - loss models . in this paper",
    "we extend the range of published data on @xmath28  @xcite by a ) reaching higher @xmath5 , and thereby moving to a @xmath5region that is completely dominated by the fragmentation of hard partons and reducing the possible contribution of particles from recombination  @xcite , b ) using finer bins in centrality , thus achieving less averaging of the path length , and c ) reducing the statistical and systematic uncertainties to further constrain models .",
    "we present in this article measurements using data collected during the 2004 rhic running period .",
    "these data represent a high - statistics sample of @xmath7collisions ( approximately 50 times that of the 2002 rhic running period ) and therefore extend our ability to measure @xmath29and @xmath27to much higher @xmath5with better precision .",
    "the data presented in this paper were taken by the phenix experiment  @xcite in 2004 ( rhic run-4 ) , and represent the analysis of 821 m minimum bias au+au collisions at @xmath30  gev .",
    "the detectors involved in this analysis are the beam - beam counters  @xcite ( bbc ; triggering , centrality and reaction plane determination ) , the zero - degree calorimeter  @xcite ( zdc , centrality determination ) and the electromagnetic calorimeter  @xcite ( emcal , @xmath1 measurement ) .",
    "the bbcs are two groups of 64 hexagonal quartz erenkov radiator counters with photomultiplier readout surrounding the beampipe 144 cm up- and downstream ( `` north '' and `` south '' ) from the center of the nominal collision diamond , covering the @xmath31 pseudorapidity range and the full azimuth . coincidence of signals in at least two photomultiplier tubes in both bbcs served as a minimum bias trigger and according to simulations it captured 92% of all inelastic collisions .",
    "the size of the total signal in the bbcs increases monotonically with collision centrality at this @xmath8 .",
    "the collision vertex @xmath32 was calculated from the difference between the fastest timing signals in the north and south bbcs , respectively , with @xmath33  cm resolution .",
    "only events with @xmath34  cm were analyzed .",
    "the zdcs are small tungsten / scintillator hadron calorimeters with quartz fiber lightguides and photomultiplier readout , located between the beampipes at 18  m north and south from the collision point .",
    "they measure non - interacting `` spectator '' neutrons in a cone of about 2  mrad , and their signal is double - valued as a function of centrality ( it is low in very central and very peripheral collisions but large at mid - centrality ) .",
    "the correlation of zdc _ vs _ bbc signals resolves this ambiguity and allows a precise measurement of the true centrality for all but the most peripheral collisions .",
    "the reaction plane ( spanned by the beam direction and the impact vector of the colliding nuclei ) is determined event - by - event from the azimuthal charge distribution in the bbcs , after taking into account small nonuniformities ( in the response of individual radiators , pmts , electronics , etc . ) , using the assumption that over a large number of events the @xmath35 distribution of per - event reaction planes should be uniform .",
    "due to the large rapidity gap between the central arm ( @xmath36 ) where @xmath1s are measured , and the bbcs where the reaction plane is established , we assume that the reaction plane is unbiased and free from auto - correlations",
    ". however , the relatively coarse granularity of bbcs affects the resolution .",
    "note that in this analysis precise knowledge of the reaction plane resolution , which depends strongly on centrality , is crucial .",
    "this will be discussed in detail in the next section .",
    "neutral pions are measured by reconstructing their decay photons ( @xmath37 ) in the emcal .",
    "the emcal consists of 8 sectors at midrapidity ( @xmath36 ) , covering a total of @xmath38 in azimuth .",
    "six sectors are lead / scintillator ( pbsc ) sampling calorimeter with photomultiplier readout and @xmath39  @xmath40 granularity , two sectors are lead / glass ( pbgl ) erenkov counters with @xmath41  @xmath40 granularity and photomultiplier readout .",
    "the two detectors are 18@xmath42 and 16@xmath42 radiation lengths deep , respectively , both ensuring essentially full containment of electromagnetic showers in the relevant energy range .",
    "the _ in situ _ energy resolution is well reproduced by simulation both in pbsc and pbgl : the @xmath4peak positions and the widths both agree with the data to better than @xmath43  mev over the entire momentum range . therefore , the error on the energy ( and momentum ) scale is less than 1% .",
    "timing resolution @xmath44 is @xmath45  ps and @xmath46  ps for the pbsc and pbgl , respectively , allowing the rejection of neutrons and antineutrons up to a few @xmath16transverse momentum , which would otherwise be a major source of neutral showers up to a few gev energy . at sufficiently high transverse momenta , decay photons from a nearly symmetric ( @xmath47 )",
    "decay may produce showers in the calorimeter that start to merge into one reconstructed cluster . in the pbsc",
    "this effect is first visible around @xmath5  @xmath48  @xmath16 , at the upper end of the @xmath5region considered in this paper . due to its higher granularity and smaller molire - radius",
    "the pbgl is immune to this `` merging '' problem up to @xmath5  @xmath4915  @xmath16 .",
    "the hadronic response , timing properties and other sources of systematic errors are very different for the two calorimeter types .",
    "therefore , when extracting the @xmath35-integrated @xmath14 , which serves as absolute normalization , the pbsc and pbgl were analyzed separately and the results combined to decrease the total systematic uncertainty .",
    "as mentioned , the minimum - bias trigger in the run-4 phenix configuration is supplied by the bbcs , and the correlation of the charge deposited in the bbcs with energy deposited in the zdcs provided a determination of the centrality of the collision . the elliptic flow measurement presented in this paper is measured in seven bins of the centrality range 0 - 92% , with lowest corresponding to the most central : 0 - 5% , 5 - 10% , 10 - 20%",
    ", 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% , and 50 - 60% .",
    "in addition , the combined ranges 0 - 20% , 20 - 40% , 40 - 60% , and minimum bias bins are included .",
    "for the yields with respect to the reaction plane , the centralities presented are 0 - 10% , 10 - 20% , 20 - 30% , 30 - 40% , 40 - 50% , 50 - 60% . finally , the @xmath14versus nuclear path length result excludes the most central bin due to its smaller intrinsic ellipticity ( the average path length is insensitive to @xmath50 ) .",
    "the technique used to determine the reaction plane on an event - by - event basis is the same used in previous phenix analyses  @xcite .",
    "the quartz radiators of each counter are arranged in approximately concentric circles around the beam axis .",
    "the light collected in the photo - multiplier tubes ( pmts ) allows for an estimate of the number of charged particles passing through the detector .",
    "the number of charged particles at a given pmt position , @xmath51 , is weighted in a manner to reduce the bias of the inner rings and used to measure the orientation of the reaction plane from the formula @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the nominal azimuth of the radiator .",
    "subtraction of the average centroid removes biases due to various detector effects .",
    "a final flattening technique is used to remove the residual non - uniformities in the distribution of angles .    to estimate the resolution of the reaction plane measurement",
    ", we use the sub - event technique  @xcite .",
    "the approach consists of dividing the event up into two sub - events roughly equal in size .",
    "the two individual bbcs provide a natural sub - event division , so we analyze the distribution of event - by - event differences between the reaction plane angles measured in the north and south counters , @xmath54 . in the presence of pure flow , this distribution takes the form @xcite :        @xmath55 +    \\chi^2\\left[i_1(z)+\\rm{l}_1(z)\\right]\\right\\ } \\label{eq : olli}. \\label{eq : ollitrault}\\ ] ]    where @xmath56 and the functions @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the modified bessel functions of the first kind and modified struve functions , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath59 describes the dispersion of the flow @xmath60 vector and thus determines the correction required for the reaction plane resolution .",
    "since @xmath61 represents the whole - event difference distribution and we are dealing with sub - events with roughly half the multiplicity of the event , we replace @xmath62 in eq .",
    "[ eq : ollitrault ] and fit this function to the measured @xmath61 distribution to extract @xmath59 .",
    "the resulting value is then used to evaluate the resolution of the event - plane of @xmath63 order  @xcite : @xmath64 \\label{eq : rp_res}\\ ] ]    where the true reaction plane orientation is denoted by @xmath65 and the observed orientation by @xmath66 .",

    "both 5% and 10% wide bins are shown for comparison .",

    "is derived under the assumption that the azimuthal distributions are free of non - flow effects . due to the large rapidity gap between the bbcs and the central arm region",
    ", it is expected that particles observed in the bbcs have no correlation with those measured in the central arm detectors .",
    "pythia  @xcite studies have been used to confirm that jets observed in the central arm have negligible effect on the reaction plane measurement from the bbcs@xcite .",
    "measurement of neutral pions has played a critical role in the study of high-@xmath5phenomena at rhic , and especially by phenix  @xcite .",
    "the two - particle decay channel @xmath67 provides a clean signal of identified hadrons out to the highest @xmath5regions .",
    "emcalshowers are found by clustering contiguous towers with energy above a threshold energy ( 10 mev ) and requiring at least 50 mev in the tower with highest energy deposit .",
    "the impact position is calculated from the positions of the participating towers weighted by the logarithm of deposited energy .",
    "the energy of the cluster is corrected for non - perpendicular incidence  the angle being derived by assuming a straight path between the actual vertex and the calculated impact point  as well as nonlinearities  @xcite . in high - multiplicity events such as central @xmath7collisions , there is an increasing probability for clusters to overlap ( one tower accumulates energy from more than one particle ) , which can distort an energy measurement from a simple sum over contiguous towers . to mitigate this effect",
    ", the emcal clustering algorithm also provides a quantity called _ ecore _ , which is determined by extrapolating the `` core '' energy represented by the central four or five towers in the cluster , assuming an electromagnetic shower profile .",
    "the energy- and impact angle- dependent shower profile is a model developed from and checked against beam test data . in this way ,",
    "_ ecore _ provides a more realistic measurement of the shower energy , less prone to contributions from accidental overlaps ( particles hitting close enough they deposit energy in the same towers ) than a simple energy sum of participating towers would be .",
    "we use this _ ecore _ for the energy of reconstructed clusters in this analysis .",
    "the invariant mass of a photon pair @xmath68 as measured in the emcal is calculated from the energy of the clusters and their measured position : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the opening angle between the two photons and @xmath71 is equal to the @xmath4mass for photons from the decay of the same @xmath4 . since the photons from the @xmath4are not tagged , such pairs have to be formed from each photon pair in the event where the pair momentum falls in a particular @xmath5bin , and some of these pairs might accidentally reproduce the @xmath4mass as well ( combinatorial background ) , particularly at lower @xmath5and higher centralities ( multiplicities ) . since @xmath4s can not be uniquely identified , raw @xmath4yields are extracted statistically , by subtracting the combinatorial background from the invariant mass distribution .    a well - known technique to reduce the combinatorial background is to place a cut on the energy asymmetry of the pair , as defined by : @xmath72 because the angular distribution @xmath73 of the pairs in the rest frame of the @xmath4is uniform , the asymmetry distribution should be flat . however , due to the steeply falling photon spectrum , fake ( non - correlated ) pairs which still give the proper @xmath4mass are strongly peaked towards @xmath74 .",
    "a pair of clusters in the emcalis considered a neutral pion candidate only if the pair s asymmetry is less than 0.8 .",
    "in addition , the two photons are required to be separated by at least 8  cm for the combination to be considered as a @xmath4candidate .",
    "there remains a non - trivial background contribution which passes these cuts : pairs of photons from different @xmath4s , or , more generally , from pairs of uncorrelated clusters which pass the photon identification cuts and accidentally give an invariant mass near the true @xmath4mass .",
    "this remaining combinatorial background is estimated and subtracted using the event mixing method .",
    "the procedure involves forming pairs from different events , which will by definition be uncorrelated .",
    "each photon candidate is combined with all the photon candidates in previous events stored in memory . in order to replicate the background from uncorrelated pairs within the same event as closely as possible in the mixed events , mixing is performed within bins of centrality , vertex @xmath32 position , and reaction plane orientation . since all events analyzed are minimum - bias , no special steps are needed to avoid the distortions of the mixed - event background by the trigger requirement .",
    "all cuts applied to the combinations of same event pairs are also applied to mixed - event pairs .",
    "the number of events buffered determines the statistics of the event - mixed distributions , chosen as a tradeoff between desired statistical accuracy and computational resources .",
    "the data presented in this article are mixed with five previous events ( in each centrality , vertex , and reaction plane bin ) .    for a given @xmath5bin ,",
    "the mixed - event mass distribution is normalized to the same - event distribution in a region away from the @xmath4mass peak .",
    "the normalization region is 0.250.45",
    "gev/@xmath75 for @xmath76  gev/@xmath77 and 0.210.45  gev/@xmath75 otherwise .",
    "[ fig : pi0mass ] shows an example of this subtraction process for two @xmath5ranges in two centrality bins .",
    "the scaled background distribution is then subtracted from the same - event pair distribution .",
    "the subtracted result thus represents a sample of real @xmath4s .",
    "the peak is fit to a gaussian to determine its width and mean position .",
    "the raw yield of @xmath4s is determined by integrating the counts in a window of @xmath78 around the mean .",
    "the width and mean are recorded and parameterized as a function of @xmath5and centrality based upon this @xmath35-integrated , large sample .",
    "the positions and widths from this parameterization are then used when we extract the ( much smaller ) raw yields in bins of angle @xmath22 with respect to the reaction plane .",
    "the maximum variation of the yields ( multiplicities ) with @xmath22 is only about a factor of 2 , and therefore the means and widths are not expected to change substantially .",
    "furthermore , the statistics are much poorer in the @xmath22 bins , which would make individual @xmath4fits unreliable .",
    "there is a residual background in the invariant mass distributions even after the mixed - event distribution has been removed , especially at lower @xmath5(below @xmath79  gev/@xmath77 ) .",
    "this is due to correlations that event mixing can not reproduce , like the `` sub - event structure '' due to the presence of jets or multiple , close - by showers from an annihilating anti - neutron , or imperfections of the reconstruction algorithm , such as cluster merging , cluster splitting , and a host of other contributions .",
    "much of the residual background is excluded by starting the fit at 0.09  @xmath16 .",
    "what is left is accounted for by including a first - order polynomial in the fits to the ( already background - subtracted ) invariant mass distribution , and subtracting its integral from the raw @xmath4yield ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pi0mass ] ) . in the more central events ,",
    "the peak deviates slightly from gaussian on the high mass side , due to overlapping clusters .",
    "the use of _ ecore _ mitigates this effect , and the systematic uncertainty on yield extraction arising from the remaining asymmetry has been estimated to be 3 - 4%  @xcite .          to obtain the azimuthal angle dependence of @xmath4production , we measure raw @xmath4yields in a given @xmath5bin as a function of the @xmath4angle with respect to the reaction plane orientation in six equally - spaced bins of @xmath80 covering the range @xmath81 .",

    "while the statistical precision of the high-@xmath5data limits the conclusions we can draw from the fits , it is clear that the data support the assumption of a decreased dominance of soft processes transitioning to an increased dominance of hard process with increasing @xmath5 .",
    "the more peripheral bins suggest that a @xmath5-independent @xmath27may be reached by @xmath168  @xmath16 .",
    "the differential probes represented by @xmath28 provide a more sophisticated handle on the role of geometry in the collision region .",
    "for example , we see that in mid - centrality collisions the suppression of pions out - of - plane is approximately the same as the suppression in more central collisions .",
    "the data suggest that the interplay between the two main effects , namely collective flow and jet quenching , may take place not only along the expected transition in @xmath5from soft to hard physics , but perhaps also azimuthally , with the quenching effects being dominant along the direction normal to the reaction plane . to further shed light on the transition from soft to hard @xmath5regions",
    ", we have fit the maxima of mid - central @xmath20 in each @xmath22range . between the in and out of plane directions ,",
    "we observe a shift of @xmath169  @xmath16 in position of the peak of the spectrum .    in order to further clarify the centrality evolution of the azimuthal dependence of the @xmath4suppression , we have presented the @xmath14as a function of @xmath25 in fixed @xmath5bins , for three directions : along the reaction plane , normal to the reaction plane , and midway between . for @xmath170 , the @xmath14along",
    "the normal to the reaction plane is almost constant , a trend seen in most @xmath5bins .",
    "by contrast , the @xmath14nearest to the reaction plane drops by almost a factor of two , converging on the out - of - plane value at the highest @xmath25 .",
    "this important feature may provide the most compelling argument for geometry as the source of suppression .",
    "since the path length in the direction normal to the reaction plane varies slowly with centrality , we would expect the @xmath14to be nearly flat .",
    "conversely , the in - plane path length will be sensitive to the degree of overlap and strongly influence the observed @xmath14 .",
    "thus it would lead to a small suppression in peripheral collisions while eventually converging on the same value as seen normal to the plane as the anisotropy vanishes in more central collisions .",
    "this effect is further borne out in the correlation observed between @xmath27and the inclusive @xmath14 .",
    "however , we have also argued that contamination from soft production could produce a similar behavior and we have no independent indication of how far in @xmath5soft contamination might extend .",
    "nonetheless , under both interpretations we can conclude that the @xmath14  for pions produced along the normal to the reaction plane more directly reflects the physics of quenching .",
    "we also conclude that the correlation between @xmath14and @xmath27makes separate treatment of these quantities disadvantageous .",
    "we have examined @xmath14as function of the average path length of the parent parton through the overlap region in the collision , through the estimators @xmath142 , @xmath143 , @xmath157 , and @xmath150 .",
    "each of the first three quantities represents a progressively more sophisticated estimator for the distance traveled by the parton , with @xmath150at the end providing a proxy for lpm energy loss .",
    "comparison of the scaling with these three measures of lengths seems to suggest that the pion suppression at low- to moderate-@xmath5is mostly dependent upon simply the geometric length .",
    "the estimator that should in principle be the most realistic one , @xmath150 , exhibits good universality at the highest @xmath5values , suggesting that energy loss comparisons should be restricted to the @xmath5range @xmath171  @xmath16 .",
    "the importance of simple geometry at low- to moderate-@xmath5is further supported when @xmath150is normalized by the participant density at the center .",
    "this normalization effectively makes @xmath150a length .",
    "these geometric descriptions offer a description of the suppression both at low and high @xmath5regions , clearly showing a transition between the ranges .",
    "the features seen in the @xmath14as function of path length tie in consistently with the observations of a transition in the behavior of the measured @xmath27 .",
    "these two observables , @xmath27and @xmath28 , analyzed together provide a valuable set of probes for understanding the processes governing the suppression of yields in @xmath7collisions .",
