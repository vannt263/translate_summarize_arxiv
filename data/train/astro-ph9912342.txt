    "the chemical abundances of long - lived f and g main sequence stars , combined with kinematical data and ages , provide a powerful way to probe the chemical and dynamical evolution of the galaxy .",
    "as far as the disk stars are concerned , many general trends have been discovered during the past decades .",
    "most notable results are correlations of metallicity with age , galactocentric distance , and vertical distance from the galactic plane based on photometric or low - resolution observations ( e.g. eggen et al .",

    "( @xcite , hereafter eaglnt ) .",
    "the main results from this work may be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) there are no tight relations between age , metallicity and kinematics of disk stars , but substantial dispersions imposed on weak statistical trends .",
    "( 2 ) there exists a real scatter in the run of [ @xmath5/fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] possibly due to the mixture of stars with different origins .",

    "together with a possible increase in the dispersion of @xmath8 ( the stellar velocity perpendicular to the galactic plane with respect to the local standard of rest , lsr ) at this point , the result suggests a dual model for disk formation .",
    "it is , however , unclear if the transition at @xmath6}}\\simeq -0.4 $ ] represents the division between the thin disk and the thick disk .",
    "( 3 ) a group of metal - poor disk stars with @xmath2  kpc is found to have larger [ @xmath5/fe ] values than stars with @xmath9 kpc , indicating a higher star formation rate ( sfr ) in the inner disk than that in the outer disk . since essentially",
    "all the oldest stars in eaglnt have small @xmath3 , it is , however , difficult to know upon which , @xmath3 or age , the main dependence of [ @xmath5/fe ] is .",
    "( 4 ) at a given age and @xmath3 , the scatter in [ @xmath5/fe ] is negligible while [ fe / h ] does show a significant scatter .",
    "the former implies that the products of supernovae of different types are thoroughly mixed into the interstellar medium ( ism ) before significant star formation occurs .",
    "based on this , the large scatter in may be explained by infall of unprocessed gas with a characteristic mixing time much longer than that of the gas from supernovae of different types . ( 5 ) the galactic scatter may be different for individual @xmath5 elements ; [ mg / fe ] and [ ti / fe ] show a larger scatter at a given metallicity than [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] .",
    "it suggests that individual @xmath5 elements may have different origins .",
    "( 6 ) a new stellar group , rich in na , mg , al , was found among the metal - rich disk stars , suggesting additional synthesis sources for these elements .",
    "given that the study of eaglnt was based on a limited sample of stars with certain selection effects and that the analysis technique induced uncertainties in the final abundances , some subtle results need further investigation before they can provide reliable constraints on theory .",
    "for example , it is somewhat unclear if the different [ @xmath5/fe ] at a given metallicity between the inner disk and the outer disk stars is real and if old disk stars are always located in the inner disk .",

    "firstly , we now have more reliable atmospheric parameters .",
    "the effective temperature is derived from the strmgren @xmath10 color index using a recent infrared - flux calibration and the surface gravity is based on the hipparcos parallax .",
    "about one hundred iron lines ( instead of @xmath11 in eaglnt ) are used to provide better determinations of metallicity and microturbulence .",
    "secondly , the abundance calculation is anchored at the most reliable theoretical or experimental oscillator strengths presently available in the literature .",
    "thirdly , greater numbers of ,  and  lines in our study should allow better abundance determinations , and new elements ( k , sc , v , cr and mn ) will give additional information on galactic evolution .",
    "lastly , the stellar age determination is based on new evolutionary tracks , and the space velocity is derived from more reliable distance and proper motion values .    in the following sections [ sec : obs ] to [ sec : age ] , we describe the observations and methods of analysis in details and present the derived abundances , ages and kinematics .",

    "the observations were carried out with the coud echelle spectrograph attached to the 2.16 m telescope at beijing astronomical observatory ( xinglong , p.r . china ) .",
    "the detector was a tek ccd ( @xmath19 pixels with @xmath20 each in size ) .",
    "the red arm of the spectrograph with a 31.6 grooves / mm grating was used in combination with a prism as cross - disperser , providing a good separation between the echelle orders . with a 0.5 mm slit ( 1.1 arcsec ) ,",

    "the spectra were reduced with standard midas routines for order identification , background subtraction , flat - field correction , order extraction and wavelength calibration .",

    "if an early b - type star could be observed close to the program stars , it was used instead of the flat - field in order to remove interference fringes more efficiently .",
    "the spectrum was then normalized by a continuum function determined by fitting a spline curve to a set of pre - selected continuum windows estimated from the solar atlas .",
    "finally , correction for radial velocity shift , measured from at least 20 lines , was applied before the measurement of equivalent widths .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured by three methods : direct integration , gaussian and voigt function fitting , depending on which method gave the best fit of the line profile .",
    "usually , weak lines are well fitted by a gaussian , whereas stronger lines in which the damping wings contribute significantly to their equivalent widths need the voigt function to reproduce their profiles .",
    "if unblended lines are well separated from nearby lines , direct integration is the best method . in the case of some intermediate - strong lines ,",
    "weighted averages of gaussian and voigt fitting were adopted .",
    "the accuracy of the equivalent widths is estimated by comparing them to the independent measurements by eaglnt for 25 stars in common .",
    "five of them were observed at the eso observatory ( @xmath22 , s / n @xmath21 200 ) and 23 were observed at the mcdonald observatory ( @xmath23 , s / n @xmath21 200  500 ) .",
    "the systematic difference between the two sets of measurements is small and a linear least squares fitting gives : @xmath24 the standard deviations around the two relations are 3.8 m  ( for 129 lines in common with eso ) and 4.3 m  ( for 575 lines in common with mcdonald ) . given that the error of the equivalent widths in eaglnt is around 2 m , we estimate an rms error of about 3 m  in our equivalent widths . as shown by the comparison of our equivalent widths with eso data in fig .",
    "[ fig : esoew ] , the equivalent widths below 50 m  are consistent with the one - to - one relation . the deviations for the stronger lines may be due to the fact that all lines in eaglnt were measured by gaussian fitting , which leads to an underestimate of equivalent widths for intermediate - strong lines because of neglecting their wings .",
    "we conclude that the xinglong data may be more reliable than the eaglnt data for lines in the range of @xmath25  m .",

    "but it is well known that the derivation of iron abundance from and  lines may be affected by many factors such as unreliable oscillator strengths , possible non - lte effects and uncertainties in the temperature structure of the model atmospheres . from the hipparcos parallaxes , we can determine more reliable gravities using the relations : @xmath36 and @xmath37 where , @xmath38 is the stellar mass , @xmath39 the absolute bolometric magnitude , @xmath40 the visual magnitude , @xmath41 the bolometric correction , and @xmath42 the parallax .",

    "it is interesting that there is a hint of a smaller metallicity spread for young stars with @xmath136 in this work than in eaglnt , while the spread is similar for old stars .",

    "another interesting feature for the young stars is that [ ba / h ] has a smaller metallicity spread than [ fe / h ] and [ @xmath5/h ] .",

    "note , however , that the lower metallicity toward the galactic center ( @xmath144 ) for group c stars may be due to their large ages . excluding these stars , a trend of decreasing metallicity with increasing @xmath138 for stars with similar age is found , which indicates a radial abundance gradient in the disk , and thus suggests a faster evolution in the inner disk than the outer .",
    "this is compatible with a higher sfr , due to the higher density , in the inner disk .",

    "ba is then enriched significantly at later stages of the disk evolution , but the decrease of [ ba / fe ] for more metal - rich stars beginning with @xmath6}}\\sim -0.2 $ ] is unexpected .    given that the low [ ba / fe ] for some stars may be related to their ages , the relation of [ ba / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] at different age ranges was investigated ( see fig .",

    "this is consistent with the formation of young stars at a later stage of the disk when long - lived agb stars have enhanced ba in the ism .",
    "the flat [ ba / fe ] for @xmath6}}<-0.3 $ ] may be explained by the suggestion of eaglnt that the synthesis of ba in agb stars is independent of metallicity , i.e. that ba shows a primary behaviour during the evolution of the disk .",
    "but the age effect alone can not explain the underabundant [ ba / fe ] in metal - rich stars , because [ ba / fe ] decreases with metallicity for all ages after @xmath6}}= -0.3 $ ] .",
    "one reason could be that s - element synthesis occurs less frequently in metal - rich agb stars possibly because the high mass loss finishes their evolution earlier .",
    "one of the interesting results of this study is that the oldest stars presently located in the solar neighbourhood have @xmath144 .",
    "hence , they probably originate from the inner disk having @xmath2 kpc .",
    "this is not coincidentally found in our study .",
    "the eaglnt sample contains about 20 such stars . as shown in both works , these stars are generally more metal - poor than other stars and they show a larger spread in [ fe / h ] and [ ba / h ] than in [ @xmath5/h ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : abuage ] ) . according to eaglnt",
    ", they have higher [ @xmath5/fe ] than other disk stars at a metallicity about @xmath6}}=-0.7 $ ] .    considering these different properties",
    ", we suggest that they do not belong to the thin disk .",
    "firstly , they are older ( 10 - 18 gyr ) than other stars .",
    "secondly , if they are thin disk stars , it is hard to understand why stars coming from both sides of the solar annulus have lower metallicity than the local region .",
    "thirdly , these stars show a relatively small metallicity dispersion at such early galactic time , i.e. smaller than stars at 8 - 10 gyr .",
    "this is not in agreement with the effect of orbital diffusion working during the evolution of the thin disk , which suggests larger metallicity dispersion for older stars .",
    "finally , the @xmath139 dispersion of these stars is about 40  @xmath75 , considerably larger than the typical value of about 20  @xmath75 for thin disk stars .",
    "consistently , the kinematics , age , metallicity and abundance ratios of these stars follow the features of the thick disk : @xmath144 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 gyr , @xmath6 } } < -0.5 $ ] and [ @xmath5/fe ] @xmath155 .",
    "we conclude that these oldest stars in both eaglnt and this work are thick disk stars .",
    "hence , they are probably not resulting from an inside - out formation of the galactic disk , but have been formed in connection with a merger of satellite components with the galaxy .    concerning the abundance connection of the thick disk with the thin disk , our data for [ @xmath5/fe ] , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : abuafea ] , suggest a more smooth trend than those of eaglnt , who found a correlation between [ @xmath5/fe ] and @xmath3 at @xmath6}}\\sim -0.7 $ ] .",
    "we leave the issue open considering the small number of these stars in our work .",
    "two stars marked by their names in fig .  [ fig : abuafea ] may be particularly interesting because they show significantly higher [ @xmath5/fe ] than other stars .",
    "fuhrmann & bernkopf ( @xcite ) suggest that one of them , , is a thick - disk field blue straggler .",
    "it is unclear if this can explain the higher [ @xmath5/fe ] .",
    "is a nitrogen rich binary ( beveridge & sneden @xcite ) with @xmath156 and @xmath157 ( typical for halo stars ) , but with @xmath158 similar to the value for thin disk stars .",
    "surprisingly , this star is also very young ( 5.5 gyr ) for it s metallicity .",
    "it is interesting to re - inspect the observational results for thin disk stars excluding the thick disk stars .",
    "more direct information on the evolution of the galactic thin disk will be then obtained . in summary ,",
    "the thin disk is younger ( not older than 12 gyr ) , more metal - rich ( @xmath6}}>-0.8 $ ] ) and has a smaller [ @xmath5/fe ] spread ( 0.1 dex ) without the mixture of the thick disk stars .",
    "in particular , the amr is more weak and there seems to exist a radial metallicity gradient .",
    "all these features agree better with the present evolutionary models for the galactic disk .",
    "we emphasize here that there is no obvious gradient in [ @xmath5/fe ] for the thin disk at a given metallicity .",
    "such a gradient was suggested by eaglnt based on higher [ @xmath5/fe ] of the oldest stars with @xmath2 kpc than stars with @xmath159 kpc ( see their fig .",
    "after we have ascribed these oldest stars to the thick disk , the abundance gradient disappears .",
    "our study of relative abundance ratios as a function of @xmath6}}$ ] suggests that there are subtle differences of origin and enrichment history both within the group of @xmath5 elements and the iron - peak elements .",
    "nucleosynthesis theory predicts that si and ca are partly synthesized in sne ia , while o and mg are only produced in sne ii ( tsujimoto et al .",
    "our data suggest , however , that sne ia may also be a significant synthesis site of mg , because [ mg / fe ] shows a trend more similar to [ si / fe ] and [ ca / fe ] than to [ o / fe ] .",
    "ti may not lie in a smooth extension of si and ca , because there is a hint of a decrease of [ ti / fe ] for @xmath6 } } > -0.4 $ ] not seen in the case of si and ca .",
    "the situation for the odd - z elements is more complicated . the available data for na and al show confusing disagreements ; eaglnt finds an overabundance of 0.1 to 0.2 dex for [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] among the metal - poor disk stars , whereas our study points at solar ratios .",
    "two other odd - z elements , k and sc ( nissen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , behave like @xmath5 elements , but the result for k is sensitive to the assumption of lte .",
    "the iron - peak elements also show different behaviours : v , cr and ni follow fe very well , while [ mn / fe ] ( nissen et al .",
    "@xcite ) decreases with decreasing metallicity from [ mn / fe ]  @xmath160 at @xmath6}}= 0.0 $ ] to [ mn / fe ]  @xmath161 at @xmath6}}= -1.0 $ ] .",
    "we conclude that the terms `` @xmath5 elements '' and `` iron - peak elements '' do not indicate productions in single processes , and that each element seems to have a unique enrichment history .",
