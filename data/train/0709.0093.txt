    "numerical relativity has made enormous progress within the last few years .",
    "many numerical relativity groups now have sufficiently stable and accurate codes which can simulate the inspiral , merger , and ringdown phases of binary black hole coalescence .",
    "similarly , significant progress has been made in the numerical simulation of stellar gravitational collapse and there now seems to be a much better understanding of how supernova explosions happen .",
    "all these processes are among the most promising sources of gravitational radiation and therefore , there is significant interest in using these numerical relativity results within various data analysis pipelines used within the gravitational wave data analysis community . a dialog between numerical relativists and data analysts from the ligo scientific collaboration ( lsc ) was recently initiated in november 2006 through a meeting in boston .",
    "it seems appropriate to continue this dialog at a more concrete level , and to start incorporating numerical relativity results within various data analysis software .",
    "the aim of this document is to suggest formats for data exchange between numerical relativists and data analysts .",
    "it is clear that there are still outstanding conceptual and numerical issues remaining in these numerical simulations ; the goal of this document is not to resolve them .",
    "the goal is primarily to spell out the technical details of the waveform data so that they can be incorporated seamlessly within the data analysis software currently being developed within the lsc .",
    "the relevant software development is being carried out as part of the lsc algorithms library which contains core routines for gravitational wave data analysis written in ansi c89 , and is distributed under the gnu general public license .",
    "the latest version of this document is available within this library .",
    "the remainder of this document is structured as follows : section [ sec : multipoles ] describes our conventions for decomposing the gravitational wave data in terms of spherical harmonics , section [ sec : format ] specifies the data formats for binary black hole simulations , and finally section [ sec : openissues ] enumerates some open issues in binary black hole simulations which could be topics of further discussion between data analysts and numerical relativists .",
    "the output of a numerical relativity code is the full spacetime of a binary black hole system . on the other hand ,",
    "what is required for gravitational wave data analysis purposes is the strain @xmath0 , as measured by a detector located far away from the source .",
    "the quantity of interest is therefore the gravitational wave metric perturbation @xmath1 in the wave - zone , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are space - time indices .",
    "we always work in the transverse traceless ( tt ) gauge so that all information about the metric perturbation is contained in the tt tensor @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are spatial indices .",
    "the wave falls off as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the distance from the source : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is a transverse traceless tensor and @xmath11 is the total mass of the system ; this approximation is , naturally , only valid far away from the source .",
    "there are different methods for extracting @xmath4 from a numerical evolution .",
    "one common method is to use the complex weyl tensor component @xmath12 which is related to the second time derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "another method is to use the zerilli function which approximates the spacetime in the wave - zone as a perturbation of a schwarzschild spacetime . for our purposes , it is not important how the wave is extracted , and different numerical relativity groups are free to use methods they find appropriate .",
    "the starting point of our analysis are the multipole moments of @xmath4 and it is important to describe explicitly our conventions for the multipole decomposition .",
    "in addition to these multipole moments , we also request the corresponding values of @xmath12 or the zerilli function in the formats described later .",
    "let @xmath13 be a cartesian coordinate system in the wave zone , sufficiently far away from the source .",
    "let @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the spatial orthonormal coordinate basis vectors . given this coordinate system ,",
    "we define standard spherical coordinates @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the inclination angle from the @xmath19-axis and @xmath20 is the phase angle . at this point , we have not specified anything about the source .",
    "in fact , the source could be a binary system , a star undergoing gravitational collapse or anything else that could be of interest for gravitational wave source modeling . in a later section",
    "we will specialize to binary black hole systems and suggest possibilities for some of the various choices that have to be made . however , as far as possible , these choices are eventually to be made by the individual source modeling group .",
    "we break up @xmath4 into modes in this coordinate system . in the wave zone , the wave will be propagating in the direction of the radial unit vector    @xmath21    in the transverse traceless gauge , @xmath4 has two independent polarizations @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the usual basis tensors for transverse - traceless tensors in the wave frame @xmath25 it is convenient to use the combination @xmath26 , which is related to @xmath12 by two time derivatives as @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the weyl tensor and @xmath29 denote abstract spacetime indices .",
    "if we denote the unit timelike normal to the spatial slice as @xmath30 and the promotions of @xmath31 to the full spacetime as @xmath32 , then the null tetrad adapted to the constant @xmath8 spheres is @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the complex conjugate of @xmath38 . ]",
    "@xmath39 it can be shown that @xmath40 can be decomposed into modes using spin weighted spherical harmonics @xmath41 of weight -2 : @xmath42 the expansion parameters @xmath43 are complex functions of the retarded time @xmath44 and , if we fix @xmath8 to be the radius of the sphere at which we extract waves , then @xmath43 are functions of @xmath45 only .",
    "the explicit expression for the spin weighted spherical harmonics in terms of the wigner @xmath46-functions is @xmath47 where @xmath48^{1/2}}{(\\ell + m        -k)!(\\ell - s - k)!k!(k+s - m ) ! }        \\times \\left(\\cos\\left(\\frac{\\iota}{2}\\right)\\right)^{2\\ell+m - s-2k}\\left(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\iota}{2}\\right)\\right)^{2k+s - m}\\ ] ] with @xmath49 and @xmath50 . for reference ,",
    "@xmath51 the mode expansion coefficients @xmath43 are given by @xmath52 if @xmath12 is used for wave extraction , then @xmath43 is given by two time integrals of the corresponding mode of @xmath12 . in this case , it is important that the information provided contains details about how the integration constants are chosen .",
    "we define @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 it is these modes @xmath56 of @xmath57 and @xmath58 that we suggest to be provided as functions of time in units of @xmath11 .",
    "let us now specialize in simulations of binary black hole coalescence .",
    "a numerical relativity simulation has many parameters that need to be specified , and several of them may not be directly relevant to the data analysis problem .",
    "we need to specify which parameters of the numerical simulation will be significantly useful for the astrophysics of a binary black hole system in a circular orbit . for our purposes ,",
    "a single numerical waveform is defined by at least seven parameters : the mass ratio @xmath59 and the three components of the individual spins @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "these parameters will be referred to as the `` metadata '' for a waveform ; more parameters can be added as necessary .",
    "we use the convention that @xmath62 denotes the larger of the two masses so that @xmath63 . the choice of precisely how @xmath62 , @xmath64 and the spins are calculated is left up to the individual numerical relativity groups .",
    "in addition , the start frequency @xmath65 of the waveform , in units of @xmath11 , is an important parameter relevant for data analysis . for a given value of the mass ,",
    "this gives the physical start frequency of the waveform , and this will need to be lesser than the lower cut - off frequency relevant for a particular detector .",
    "for example , @xmath66hz is an appropriate value appropriate for the initial ligo detectors .    for the wavfeorm data itself , we suggest the data for a single mode @xmath56 to be written as a plain text file in three columns for the time @xmath45 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 respectively . for a given simulation , numerical groups may wish to decide the maximum value of @xmath69 to which they will provide the waveform . from the data analysis standpoint",
    ", it is most useful that for every @xmath70 , waveforms are provided for all values of @xmath71 , irrespective of any symmetries that may be present in the simulation .",
    "if there are certain modes which , due to small amplitude , can not be accurately determined , these can be set to zero .",
    "numerical groups often extract the waveform from the simulation at several different radii and then use richardson extrapolation to determine the most accurate waveform . for data analysis purposes , we do not consider waveforms from different radii as distinct , and would prefer only the most accurate determination of the waveform from any given simulation .",
    "it is natural to use the total mass @xmath11 of the binary as the unit for the time and strain columns .",
    "however , there can be subtleties in the choice of @xmath11",
    ". it could be the adm mass of the spacetime , an approximation to the adm mass measured at the wave - extraction sphere , or it could be the sum of the individual masses . again , the choice is left up to the numerical relativity group which produced the waveform , and it depends on whatever best represents the time coordinate and the scale of @xmath4 in the particular simulation .    for data analysis purposes , we would prefer the sampling in time to be uniform .",
    "if the result of a simulation , or set of simulations , yields a waveform sampled non - uniformly , we ask that the nr group performs an interpolation to give a uniformly sampled waveform .",
    "a sampling rate of @xmath72 is usually sufficient for our purposes , but this is not a requirement .",
    "the strain multiplied by the distance will also be in units of the total mass @xmath11 of the binary .",
    "there can be any number of comment lines at the top of the file and it is envisioned that the details of the simulation and the mode contained in the file will be held in the comment lines .",
    "this could be an example of a data file :    .... # numerical waveform from .... # equal mass , non spinning , 5 orbits , l = m=2 # time        hplus         hcross 0.000000e+00 1.138725e-02 -8.319811e-04 2.000000e-01 1.138725e-02 -1.247969e-03 4.000000e-01 1.138726e-02 -1.663954e-03 6.000000e-01 1.138727e-02 -2.079936e-03 8.000000e-01 1.138728e-02 -2.495913e-03 1.000000e-00 1.138728e-02 -2.911884e-03 1.200000e+00 1.138729e-02 -3.327850e-03 1.400000e+00 1.138730e-02 -3.743807e-03 1.600000e+00 1.138731e-02 -4.159757e-03 1.800000e+00 1.138733e-02 -4.575696e-03 2.000000e+00 1.138734e-02 -4.991627e-03 2.200000e+00 1.138735e-02 -5.407545e-03 2.400000e+00 1.138737e-02 -5.823452e-03 2.600000e+00 1.138739e-02 -6.239345e-03 2.800000e+00 1.138740e-02 -6.655225e-03 3.000000e+00 1.138752e-02 -7.071059e-03 3.200000e+00 1.138754e-02 -7.486903e-03 3.400000e+00 1.138757e-02 -7.902739e-03 ...... ....    the metadata information for the different datafiles will be stored in a separate file .",
    "this metadata can contain ( at least ) two sections , one for the simulation metadata , and the other listing the filenames which correspond to the various @xmath73 modes of the waveform .",
    "there will be a separate metadata file for each simulation .",
    "this could be an example of a metadata file :    .... [ metadata ] simulation - details = nrfile.dat nr - group = friendlynrgroup email = myemail@somewhere.edu mass - ratio = 1.0 spin1x = 0.0 spin1y = 0.0 spin1z = 0.5 spin2x = 0.0 spin2y = 0.8 spin2z = 0.0 freqstart22 = 0.1    [ ht - data ] 2,2   = example1_22.dat 2,1   = example1_21.dat",
    "2,0   = example1_20.dat 2,-1 = example1_2 - 1.dat 2,-2 = example1_2 - 2.dat ....    it would be desirable if the waveform data are reproducible at a later date if necessary . for this purpose , the numerical relativity groups can submit a file with the parameters of the simulation .",
    "there is no requirement on the format of this file",
    ". the ` simulation - details ` line will contain the name of the file describing the parameters used to describe the nr simulation .",
    "in addition , we ask for the numerical relativity groups to provide a ` nr - group ` name and a contact ` email ` .",
    "the remainder of the entries in the ` [ metadata ] ` section describe the physical parameters of the waveform . to begin with , for non - spinning waveforms ,",
    "the only required parameter is the mass ratio . for waveforms with spin , the initial spins of the two black holes ( in the co - ordinates discussed in the previous section )",
    "must also be specified .",
    "the start frequency of the 2 - 2 mode of the waveform in units of @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath74 .",
    "we emphasize that whenever necessary , we will add more parameters such as , for example , the eccentricity of the orbit , or start frequencies of other modes etc .",
    "lines starting with a @xmath75 or @xmath76 will be taken to be comment lines and there can be an arbitrary number of comment lines .",
    "the section ` [ ht - data ] ` contains one line for each @xmath73 mode .",
    "these give the file names containing the corresponding modes .",
    "the filenames can be specified as relative paths to the data files starting from the location of the metadata file .",
    "thus , if the datafiles are stored in a sub - directory called ` data ` , then the metadata file would read :    .... [ ht - data ] 2,2   = data / example1_22.dat 2,1   = data / example1_21.dat 2,0   = data / example1_20.dat 2,-1 = data / example1_2 - 1.dat 2,-2 = data / example1_2 - 2.dat ....    if the waveforms have been calculated using @xmath12 , then for cross - checking purposes , we request that datafiles containing the real and imaginary parts of @xmath12 are also provided in the same format as for the waveforms , i.e. three columns which are respectively time , real part of @xmath12 and imaginary part of @xmath12 .",
    "again there can be an arbitrary number of comment lines , but in this case there does not need to be a metadata file .",
    "this data can be referenced in the metadata file in an additional section :    .... [ psi4-data ] 2,2   = data / example1_psi4_22.dat 2,1   = data / example1_psi4_21.dat 2,0   = data / example1_psi4_20.dat 2,-1 = data / example1_psi4_2 - 1.dat 2,-2 = data / example1_psi4_2 - 2.dat ....    similarly , if the waveforms were extracted using the zerilli formalism , a section ` [ zerilli - data ] ` would be added .    to summarize , the numerical relativity groups are asked to submit a tarball containing the following information for each simulation :    1 .",
    ": :    [ required ] the data files for @xmath77 and    @xmath78 ",

    "we now list some open issues for binary black hole simulations which could be topics for further discussion .",
    "we associate the coordinate system @xmath13 with the binary system as follows .",
    "the orbital plane of the binary at @xmath81 is taken to be the @xmath82-@xmath83 plane with the @xmath19-axis in the direction of the orbital angular momentum .",
    "* is this the best choice of the @xmath19-axis ?",
    "would it be better to choose , say , the spin of the final black hole as the @xmath19-axis ?",
    "the decision will be determined by requirements of simplicity and having as few modes to work with as possible . *",
    "the orbital plane is unambiguous when the black holes are non - spinning but it can be ambiguous in many situations , especially when the spin of the black holes causes the orbital plane to precess significantly . in such cases ,",
    "it is left to the numerical relativity group to decide what the best choice of the `` orbital plane '' is .    what is the right choice for parameters such as the individual masses , the total mass and the spins ?",
    "here are some possibilities :    * @xmath62 and @xmath64 could be the parameters appearing in the initial data construction .",
    "alternatively , for non spinning black holes , they could be the irreducible masses of the two horizons : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the horizon area . for spinning black holes",
    "it could be given by the christodoulou formula : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is an appropriately defined spin for the individual black holes .",
    "the calculation of @xmath87 is again left up to the numerical relativity group .",
    "* for the total mass @xmath11 , is it better to use the sum of individual horizon masses ( including the effect of angular momentum ) , or could it be the total adm mass or rather , an approximation to the adm mass calculated at the sphere where the waves are extracted ? this could be specified in the metadata file , for example through the additional lines + ....       madm = 1.0       mchristodoulou = 0.97 .",
    "what is the best choice for the radiation extraction sphere ?    * how far away do we need to take the sphere ?",
    "is it sufficient to take the sphere to be a coordinate sphere , or do we need some further gauge conditions ?    how important is the choice of initial data ?    * clearly , the initial data used in almost all current simulations do not exactly represent real astrophysical binary black hole systems .",
    "is this deviation important for gravitational wave detection ?",
    "how large are the error - bars on the numerical results ?",
    "* is there a reliable way to estimate the systematic errors due to finite resolution effects , different gauge choices , wave extraction methods etc ?",
    "numerical relativity groups are welcome to raise any other issues that might be important .",
