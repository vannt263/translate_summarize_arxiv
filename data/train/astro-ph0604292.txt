    "the inflationary scenario  @xcite , in which the present universe is only a small local patch of a causally connected region at early time which underwent an exponential expansion driven by the inflaton potential , is generally accepted for explaining the observed spatially flat and homogeneous universe . in addition , its quantum fluctuations during inflation give rise to primordial gaussian density fluctuations with a nearly scale - invariant power spectrum , which is consistent with recent astrophysical and cosmological observations such as structure formation and cmb anisotropies  @xcite .    despite its success , some basic problems still remain unsolved .",
    "what is the origin of the inflaton potential ?",
    "do classical density imhomogenities that we observe today really come from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton ? to answer these questions",
    "is a big challenge to both theories and observations .",
    "the cmb anisotropy measurements made by cobe  @xcite and recently confirmed by wmap  @xcite have shown that the amplitudes of the low-@xmath0 multipoles are lower than expected for the @xmath1cdm model , although the statistical significance of such an anomaly is not large  @xcite .",
    "if this is true , it will give a clue to probe the physics of inflation .",
    "there are many proposed solutions for the anomaly , mostly based on some _ ad hoc _ new ingredients in the generating process of density perturbation  @xcite .",
    "recently the colored noise has been considered to explain the anomaly in the context of stochastic inflation  @xcite . in the stochastic approach to inflation  @xcite ,",
    "the inflaton field is coarse - grained by a heaviside window function with a sharp frequency cutoff .",
    "thus , the high - frequency modes constitute a white noise which drives the dynamics of the coarse - grained inflaton and generates a scale - invariant density power spectrum . in ref .",
    "@xcite , they have adopted instead a gaussian window function with a width characterizing the size of the coarse - grained domain  @xcite which is then arbitrarily chosen to be comparable to the hubble radius .",
    "this smooth window function results in a colored noise which generates fewer fluctuations than the white noise on the scales slightly less than the chosen coarse - grained domain .",
    "so , they find a blue tilt of the power spectrum on large scales which can be tuned to fit the wmap large - scale anisotropy data .",
    "nevertheless , in this approach they inevitably resort to an _ ad hoc _ smoothing window function and therefore the width of the window function remains undetermined .    apart from this free - field treatment",
    ", however , the inflaton is expected to be interacting with other fields ; otherwise , the potential energy stored in the inflaton field can not be converted into radiation after inflation .",
    "cosmological phenomena associated with an interacting inflaton have been immensely studied in the context of reheating , preheating , backreactions to the inflaton dynamics , and etc .",
    "@xcite . in particular , the influence from the interaction with other fields on density fluctuations during inflation has been discussed  @xcite .",
    "these have not only provided us with a field theoretical framework to understand the underlying physics of the inflation , but also explored the possibility of generating primordial density fluctuations with statistical properties deviated from both the scale - invariance and the gaussianity .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the possible effects of coupling massive quantum fields to inflation and constrain the couplings and mass parameters by using observed cmb data .",
    "we will show that the inflaton fluctuations driven by the colored noise due to the interaction with the other field are strongly dependent on the onset of inflation and become scale - invariant asymptotically at small scales .",
    "this is due to the fact that the earlier a fourier mode of the noise leaves the horizon the shorter the time can it drive the growth of the corresponding fourier mode of the inflaton fluctuations .",
    "however , these passive fluctuations would not grow arbitrarily with time but only get boosted in an intrinsic time scale . this would result in a suppression of the density power spectrum on large scales which may give a theoretical support to the low cmb low-@xmath0 multipoles , if the passive ones contribute a significant portion to the density perturbation .",
    "we will adopt the influence functional method  @xcite to take into account the quantum fluctuation effects from the massive fields coupled to the inflaton in a real - time manner , instead of using an one - loop effective potential as usually found for example in ref .",
    "thus , the effective langevin equation of the inflaton is obtained , describing the time dependent corrections of the slow - rolling dynamics of the inflaton originally given by the classical inflaton potential . in particular , this langevin equation , which goes beyond the mean field approximation , involves a stochastic noise term that may drive the growth of perturbation of the inflaton as we will see later .",
    "let us consider a slow - rolling inflaton @xmath2 coupled to a massive scalar field @xmath3 with a lagrangian given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the inflaton potential that complies with the slow - roll conditions and @xmath6 is a coupling constant .",
    "thus , we can approximate the space - time during inflation by a de sitter metric given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the conformal time and @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the hubble parameter . here",
    "we rescale @xmath11 at the initial time of the inflation era , @xmath12 . as for the system - environment field splitting , one may separate the inflaton field into its low- and high - frequency modes by introducing a window function .",
    "the low - frequency modes of cosmological relevance can be regarded as the system of interest whereas the high - frequency inflaton modes as well as the field @xmath3 are treated as an environment being traced out to the extent in how they influence the system .",
    "nevertheless , the perturbation of the inflaton of cosmological relevant scales are found to be insignificantly affected from its high - frequency counterparts due to inflaton self - interaction  @xcite .",
    "thus , here we restrict ourselves to the influence of quantum fluctuations from the field @xmath3 on the inflaton perturbation .",
    "in addition , the coupling of the inflaton to @xmath3 results in renormalization of the @xmath3 mass term due to quantum fluctuations of the inflaton , which will be included in the later discussion .    to proceed ,",
    "let us assume that the initial density matrix at time @xmath13 can be factorized as @xmath14 the full density matrix evolves unitarily and the evolution can be described by employing the closed - time - path formalism .",

    "the low value of @xmath105 is crucial in determining the observed density power spectrum consistent with current measurements  @xcite . in fact , it is found to be consistent with zero up to the scale near the first cmb doppler peak in the wmap measurements  @xcite .",
    "then , we plot @xmath99 at the horizon - crossing time given by @xmath106 versus @xmath107 in fig .",
    "the figure shows that the noise - driven fluctuations depend on the onset time of inflation and approach asymptotically to a scale - invariant power spectrum @xmath108 at large @xmath83 .    at this point ,",
    "let us examine the dissipation term in the langevin equation  ( [ lange ] ) , which is actually divergent .",
    "we have removed the divergency by using the regularization method  @xcite that sets the ultraviolet cutoff @xmath109 , which includes all the modes with wavelength greater than the horizon at time @xmath110 during inflation , as these are the ones responsible for the growth of @xmath70 ( note that we have used the same method to regularize the divergent @xmath70 above ) .",
    "hence , we have found that this term only contributes a mass correction of about @xmath111 to @xmath112 as well as a small friction term of order @xmath113 to eq .",
    "( [ lange ] ) .",
    "this term also gives a correction to the slope of the inflaton potential @xmath114 of order @xmath115 , which in turn changes the slow - roll parameter @xmath105 by @xmath116 .",

    "is not fixed except that @xmath119 , which is to keep the condition , @xmath84 , as well as to make sure that the time - dependent corrections to both the mass scales and the slow - roll parameters are small .",
    "if @xmath120 and @xmath121 , then @xmath122 can be as large as @xmath123 at large @xmath83 .",
    "notice that the perturbative expansion parameter is @xmath124 such that higher - order contributions in @xmath6 can be safely ignored . in the standard slow - roll inflation ,",
    "the density power spectrum induced by the active quantum fluctuations is nearly scale - invariant and is given by @xmath125 , where @xmath126 is determined by the slow - roll kinematics  @xcite , whereas the noise - driven density power spectrum , @xmath127 , is blue - tilted on large scales . assuming a total density power spectrum @xmath128 with @xmath129 set to constant and using the set of cosmological parameters measured by wmap  @xcite , we have run the cmbfast numerical codes  @xcite to compute the cmb anisotropy power spectrum as shown in fig .",
    "[ cl ] , where we have set @xmath130 .",
    "we can see that a scale - invariant power spectrum at small scales can be achieved by properly choosing the initial time of inflation . for the dashed ( dotted ) curve , the fourier mode @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) corresponding to the physical scale of @xmath133mpc@xmath134 crosses out the horizon at about @xmath135 ( 3.2 ) efoldings .",
    "meanwhile , the suppressed large - scale density perturbation can account for the low cmb low-@xmath0 multipoles .",
    "let us briefly mention other implications to the inflationary cosmology which deserve investigations to further constrain the free parameters here .",
    "we rewrite @xmath136 .",
    "therefore , the energy scale of inflation inferred from measurements of the density power spectrum will be lower than the standard slow - roll prediction by a factor @xmath137 .",
    "the spectal index is then given by @xmath138 the standard slow - roll inflation predicts that @xmath139 , although the three - year wmap results have indicated that @xmath140  @xcite .",
    "there have been several approaches to reduce the discrepancy by either violating or generalizing the slow - roll condition for @xmath141  @xcite . unlike these kinematic approaches , the additional term containing @xmath122 in eq .",
    "( [ index ] ) offers a new dynamical source for breaking the scale invariance .",
    "it is worthwhile to study the overall effect of the corrections induced by the dissipation , the static mass approximation , and the static mean field approximation to the spectral index .",
    "especially , we expect a running spectral index at large @xmath83 due to dissipational effects on the fluctuations at late times .",
    "furthermore , it is interesting to consider the three - point function @xmath142 by invoking higher - order terms in the presence of inflaton mean field .",
    "we have discussed the effect of an interacting inflaton to the cosmological density perturbation .",
    "the passive inflaton fluctuations induced by the interaction are found to be blue - tilted on large - scales .",
    "this results in a suppression of the large - scale cmb anisotropy that may be relevant to the observed low quadrupole in the wmap cmb anisotropy data .",
    "interestingly , the observed low cmb quadrupole may open a window on the physics of the first few efoldings of inflation .",
    "the results are obtained by solving the langevin equation  ( [ lange ] ) of the inflaton arising from its coupling to a massive quantum field with mass of the order of the hubble scale .",
    "here we have not specified the inflaton potential .",
    "however , we restrict ourselves to the situation typically for a small - field inflation , in which the mean field @xmath143 when inflaton modes of cosmologically interesting scales cross out the horizon . presently , observational data prefer a slow - roll inflaton potential ; however , the exact form of the potential is still elusive .",
    "we expect that the above mentioned situation can be realized in certain inflationary models .",
    "moreover , our assumption on the values of the introduced parameters allows us to obtain an analytic solution of the langevin equation .",
    "so , it would be interesting to relax this assumption by performing a full analysis of the cosmological effects due to the interacting quantum environment in a viable inflation model .    in fact",
    ", one can also consider the effect of a coupling scalar field to the inflaton in the context of large - field inflation such as chaotic inflation  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the corrections from the coupling scalar field to the slow - roll parameters are small for @xmath117 .",
    "hence , the coupling constant @xmath6 can be small for those large values of @xmath144 of order of @xmath73 as usually found in chaotic inflation ; however , this will give an insignificant correction to the density power spectrum .",
    "for a strong coupling of @xmath120 as found for example in the hybrid inflation  @xcite , the field @xmath3 obtains a hugh effective mass from the inflaton mean field much greater than @xmath10 .",
    "this case goes beyond our assumption and needs further study . finally ,",
