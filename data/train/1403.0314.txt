    "due to the potential impact to nanotechnology , the casimir interactions between objects of nontrivial geometries have been under active research in recent years .",
    "thanks to works done by several groups of researchers @xcite , we have now a formalism to compute the exact functional representation ( known as tgtg formula ) for the casimir interaction energy between two objects . despite the seemingly different approaches taken , all the methods can be regarded as multiple scattering approach , which can also be understood from the point of view of mode summation approach @xcite .",
    "the basic ingredients in the tgtg formula are the scattering matrices of the two objects and the transition matrices that relate the coordinate system of one object to the other . in the case that the objects have certain symmetries that allow separable coordinate system to be employed , one can calculate these matrices explicitly .",
    "this has made possible the exact analytic and numerical analysis of the casimir interaction between a sphere and a plate @xcite , between two spheres @xcite , between a cylinder and a plate @xcite , between two cylinders @xcite , between a sphere and a cylinder @xcite , as well as other geometries @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the strength of the casimir interaction does not only depend on the geometries of the objects , it is also very sensitive to the boundary conditions imposed on the objects . for the past few years , a lot of works have been done in the analysis of the quantum effect on objects with perfect boundary conditions such as dirichlet , neumann , perfectly conducting , infinitely permeable , etc .",
    "there are also a number of works which consider real materials such as metals modeled by plasma or drude models @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we consider the casimir interaction between a spherical plasma sheet and a planar plasma sheet .",
    "plasma sheet model was considered in @xcite to model graphene sheet , describing the @xmath0 electrons in c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "this model has its own appeal in describing a thin shell of materials that have the same attributes .    in @xcite ,",
    "the casimir interaction between a cylindrical plasma sheet and a planar plasma sheet has been considered .",
    "our work can be considered as a generalization of @xcite where we consider a spherical plasma sheet instead of a cylindrical plasma sheet .",
    "one of the main objectives of the current work is to derive the tgtg formula for the casimir interaction energy . as in @xcite",
    ", we are also going to study the asymptotic behaviors of the casimir interaction in the small separation regimes .",
    "we would expect that the leading term of the casimir interaction coincides with the proximity force approximation ( pfa ) , which we are going to confirm .",
    "another major contribution would be the exact analytic computation of the next - to - leading order term which determines the deviation from pfa .",
    "in this section , we derive the tgtg formula for the casimir interaction energy between a spherical plasma sheet and a planar plasma sheet . we follow our approach in @xcite .",
