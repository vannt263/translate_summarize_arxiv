    "<S> we give a new perspective on the dynamics of conformal theories realized in the su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory , when the number of flavors @xmath1 is within the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> motivated by the rg argument on conformal theories with a finite ir cutoff @xmath2 , we conjecture that the propagator of a meson @xmath3 on a lattice behaves at large @xmath4 as a power - law corrected yukawa - type decaying form @xmath5 instead of the exponentially decaying form @xmath6 , in the small quark mass region where @xmath7 : @xmath8 is the mass of the ground state hadron in the channel @xmath9 and @xmath10 is a constant of order 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the transition between the `` conformal region '' and the  confining region \" is a first order transition . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results verify the predictions for the @xmath11 case and the @xmath12 case in the su(@xmath13 ) gauge theory with the fundamental representation .    </S>",
    "<S> conformal field theories are ubiquitous in nature and play important roles not only in particle physics beyond the standard model but also in condensed matter physics . </S>",
    "<S> nonperturbative understanding of their dynamics in four - dimensional space - time is ardently desired . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we give a new perspective on the dynamics of conformal theories realized in the su(@xmath0 ) gauge theory when the number of flavors @xmath1 is within the conformal window @xcite by studying meson propagators with a finite infrared ( ir ) cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> some preliminary results have been presented in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our general argument that follows can be applied to any gauge theories with arbitrary representations as long as they are in the conformal window , but to be specific , we focus on su(3 ) gauge theories with @xmath1 fundamental fermions (  quarks \" ) . </S>",
    "<S> we define the conformal field theory in a constructive way @xcite : we employ the wilson quark action and the standard one - plaquette gauge action on the euclidean lattice of the size @xmath14 and @xmath15 with aspect ratio @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we impose periodic boundary conditions except for an anti - periodic boundary condition in the time direction for fermion fields . </S>",
    "<S> we eventually take the continuum limit by sending the lattice space @xmath17 with @xmath18 keeping @xmath19 fixed . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath20 finite , the continuum limit defines a theory with an ir cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is defined by two parameters ; the bare coupling constant @xmath21 and the bare degenerate quark mass @xmath22 at ultraviolet ( uv ) cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> we also use , instead of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for a later purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we define the quark mass @xmath25 through ward - takahashi identities with renormalization constants being suppressed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us quickly remind ourselves of the renormalization group ( rg ) flow when @xmath1 is in the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> one important fact is finite size lattices in computer simulation always introduce an ir cutoff @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> if the ir cutoff were zero , when quarks have tiny masses , the rg trajectory would stay close to the critical line , approaching the ir fixed point and finally would pass away from the ir fixed point to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the ir behavior is governed by the `` confining region '' . only on the massless quark line the scale invariance </S>",
    "<S> is realized at the ir fixed point . </S>",
    "<S> see the left panel of fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> when the cutoff @xmath2 is finite , the rg flow from uv to ir does stop evolving at the scale @xmath2 . when the typical mass scale ( e.g. that of a meson ) @xmath8 is smaller than @xmath27 , it is in the `` conformal region '' . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath8 is larger than @xmath2 , the flow passes away from the ir fixed point to infinity with relevant variables integrated out , thus being in the `` confining region '' . see the right panel of fig .  1 .    </S>",
    "<S> this scenario implies that when physical quantities at ir ( e.g. hadron masses ) are mapped into a diagram in terms of physical parameters at uv ( e.g. the bare coupling constant and the bare quark mass ) , there will be gaps in the physical quantities along the boundary between the two phases . </S>",
    "<S> there the phase transition will be a first order transition .    to make the above rg argument more concrete </S>",
    "<S> , we will study the propagator of the local meson operator @xmath28 when the theory is in the  confining region \" , it decays exponentially at large @xmath4 as @xmath29 due to the physical one - particle pole , where @xmath8 is the mass of the ground state hadron in the channel @xmath9 .         </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we claim that in the  conformal region \" defined by @xmath30 where @xmath10 is a constant of order 1 which we will determine , the propagator @xmath31 behaves at large @xmath4 as @xmath32 which is a power - law corrected yukawa - type decaying form instead of the exponential decaying form ( eq.([exp ] ) ) observed in the  confining region \" . </S>",
    "<S> we further claim that the boundary between the `` conformal region '' and the `` confining region '' is a first order transition .    </S>",
    "<S> we note that the behavior eq.([yukawa type ] ) is proposed based on the ads / cft correspondence with a softwall cutoff in the literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the meson propagator in the momentum space has a cut instead of a pole : @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator in the position space ( after space integration ) takes the form eq.([yukawa type ] ) in the limit @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> we distinguish @xmath35 in eq.([yukawa type ] ) from the pole mass @xmath8 in eq.([exp ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> eq.([critical mass ] ) thus means the lower limit of @xmath8 is @xmath36    in the continuum limit with @xmath37 ( i.e. @xmath38 ) , the propagator on the massless quark line takes the form @xmath39 consistent with @xmath40 limit of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ yukawa type ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we take the coupling constant @xmath41 at the uv cutoff , @xmath42 takes a constant value , and the rg equation demands @xmath43 for the pseudo - scalar ( ps ) channel with @xmath44 being the anomalous mass dimension @xmath45 at @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is scale invariant ( and shown to be conformal invariant within perturbation theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> see also e.g. @xcite and references therein from ads / cft approach ) . when @xmath47 , @xmath42 depends slowly on @xmath4 as a solution of the rg equation . in the ir limit @xmath48 </S>",
    "<S> , we must retain @xmath49 .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuum limit with @xmath20 finite defines a continuum theory on @xmath50 which corresponds to a compact three - torus at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the ir cutoff @xmath51 is finite . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator @xmath3 behaves at large @xmath4 as a power - law corrected yukawa type decaying form eq.([yukawa type ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath42 in @xmath48 with @xmath52 takes the universal formula @xmath53 while with @xmath54 it takes a value depending on the dynamics , from which we can estimate the mass anomalous dimensions ( see @xcite ) .        </S>",
    "<S> [ exp_vs_yukawa ]        [ expnf7nf16 ]    now let us discuss the results of our numerical calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we have performed simulations in the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases , which we conjecture @xcite , are the boundaries of the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> the algorithms we employ are the blocked hmc algorithm @xcite for @xmath55 and the rhmc algorithm @xcite for @xmath56 in the case @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> we specify the coupling constant @xmath58 for @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 taking account of the fact that the ir fixed point for @xmath12 is @xmath62 in two - loop approximation . </S>",
    "<S> we use the lattices of size @xmath63 and @xmath64 and vary the hopping parameter @xmath65 so that the quark mass takes the value from 0.40 to 0.0 : we simulate with 15 hopping parameters on the @xmath63 lattices , and 5 hopping parameters on the @xmath66 lattices .    </S>",
    "<S> we choose the run - parameters in such a way that the acceptance of the global metropolis test is about @xmath67 the statistics are 1,000 md trajectories for thermalization and 1,000 md trajectories or 500 md trajectories for the measurement . </S>",
    "<S> we estimate the errors by the jack - knife method with a bin size corresponding to 100 hmc trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> let us first discuss the results for the @xmath11 case on the @xmath63 lattices . </S>",
    "<S> we define the effective mass @xmath68 by @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  2 [ exp_vs_yukawa ] shows the @xmath4 dependence of the effective mass for the ps channel with three types of sources . on the left panel , </S>",
    "<S> we see the clear plateau of the effective mass at @xmath70 when quark mass is relatively large ; @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) . on the other hand , on the right panel , we see the effective mass is slowly decreasing without no plateau up to @xmath73 when the quark mass is small ; @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) , suggesting the power - law correction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective masses for all cases with @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) exhibit a similar behavior to the @xmath75 case . </S>",
    "<S> we show the power - law corrected fit for the local - local data in the @xmath75 case with the fitting range @xmath78 $ ] on the left panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit with @xmath79 reproduces the date very well .    </S>",
    "<S> in the case of @xmath12 , the effective masses on the @xmath63 lattices exhibit the power - law corrected yukawa - type decaying form for all cases when @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show the power - law corrected fit for the local - local data in the @xmath82 case with the fitting range @xmath78 $ ] on the right panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fit with @xmath83 reproduces the data well . </S>",
    "<S> we also report that the data on @xmath84 lattices for both cases of @xmath11 with @xmath85 and @xmath12 with @xmath81 clearly exhibit the power - law corrected yukawa type decaying form . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath86 for @xmath75 in @xmath59 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 in @xmath89 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> thus we have confirmed that the propagators behaves as the power - law corrected yukawa type decaying form , when the quark mass is small enough . </S>",
    "<S> we note in all cases the rho meson mass is degenerate with the pion mass within the one standard deviation . </S>",
    "<S> this implies the phase is a chiral symmetric phase .    in the remaining part of the article </S>",
    "<S> , we try to identify the boundary between the `` conformal region '' and the `` confining region '' more precisely by investigating the transition region carefully with a small step of the value of @xmath65 for both of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases .    </S>",
    "<S> we present the results for @xmath25 and @xmath90 ( or @xmath91 ) in the @xmath11 case in fig .  4 . </S>",
    "<S> we first note that the quark mass @xmath25 denoted by black points and line on the left panel is excellently proportional to @xmath92 in the whole region from @xmath93 to @xmath94 .        for the propagators of the ps meson </S>",
    "<S> , we observe the clear transition from the exponentially decaying form to the power - law corrected yukawa - type decaying form at @xmath95 . for @xmath96 , we present @xmath90 obtained from the fit to the exponentially decaying form with the fitting region [ 28:31 ] by green points and line . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath77 , we present @xmath91 obtained from the fit to the power - law corrected yukawa type decaying form with fitting range [ 15:31 ] by blue points and line . </S>",
    "<S> the transition region is enlarged on the right panel in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath90 and @xmath91 are different in the limit @xmath97 from smaller @xmath65 and from larger @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that even if we had ignored the power - law corrections in yukawa type decay and had estimated the @xmath90 ( plotted in fig .  4 by black points ) by assuming exponential decay with the fitting range [ 28:31 ] , although no plateau is seen as shown on the right panel of fig 2 and in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 , there would have been a gap at the transition point .    </S>",
    "<S> it is worthwhile to stress that at @xmath98 and @xmath99 we observe two states , depending on the initial sate . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of two states persists at least with 500 md trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that the exponent @xmath42 does not vanish toward the transition point ; it rather increases up to @xmath100 thus the transition is a first order transition at @xmath101 these facts imply that there indeed exists a `` conformal region '' which is separated by a gap of physical quantities from the  confining region \" at finite quark mass .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath91 is rather complicated . </S>",
    "<S> once @xmath91 becomes small at the transition point , it slightly increases as @xmath25 decreases , and then decreases at @xmath102 apparently the small @xmath91 region suffers from finite size effects . to verify the scaling relation @xcite for @xmath91 in terms of @xmath25 we have to control finite size effects .    taking @xmath103 with @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) , as the critical mass in eq.(3 ) </S>",
    "<S> , we estimate @xmath106 with our working definition of @xmath107 .    in the @xmath12 case </S>",
    "<S> we have observed similar results . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath25 dependence of @xmath91 is similarly complicated . </S>",
    "<S> the transition occurs at @xmath108 with @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) from which we estimate @xmath111    in the cases of @xmath84 lattices for both @xmath11 and @xmath12 cases , we have also observed the transition : in @xmath11 , we find exponential decay for @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) and power - law corrected yukawa type decay for @xmath114 ( @xmath85 ) . in @xmath12 , we find power - law corrected yukawa type decay for @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the critical mass decreases compared with the @xmath63 lattices as expected since the ir cutoff decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude the paper with two main goals achieved in our study . we have given evidence that ( 1 ) : the meson propagator shows a transition from an exponentially decaying form to a power - law corrected yukawa - type decaying form at the critical hadron mass whose value is specified by the ir cutoff . </S>",
    "<S> ( 2 ) : the transition is first order . the existence of the conformal region we proposed gives a necessary ( but not sufficient ) condition for the conformal window , and the result for @xmath11 is consistent with our conjecture that @xmath11 is within the conformal window . </S>",
    "<S> however we understand that we need more evidence to conclude that .    in an accompanying publication @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we will discuss the physical interpretation of the power - law corrections in terms of the dynamics of the underlying conformal field theory by taking the continuum limit . </S>",
    "<S> we also hope to report the physical applications of our findings in the near future . </S>"
