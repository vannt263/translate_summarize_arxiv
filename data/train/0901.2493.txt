    "in recent years there has been growing interest in the production and properties of cold molecules .",
    "possible applications , such as controlled ultracold chemistry @xcite , quantum information and computing @xcite , and high - precision measurements of the time - dependence of fundamental ` constants ' @xcite , make cold molecules extremely interesting across many different fields of physics .",
    "two main approaches to the production of cold molecules can be distinguished .",
    "one approach is based on the coherent formation of ultracold molecules such as cs@xmath0 or rbcs in trapped ultracold atomic gases @xcite .",
    "the molecules may be formed either by photoassociation @xcite or by feshbach resonance tuning @xcite .",
    "they inherit the @xmath1k - nk temperatures of the parent ultracold atomic cloud and usually need very little further cooling .",
    "efforts in this area have led to the bose - einstein condensation of feshbach molecules @xcite and to the transfer of feshbach molecules to low - lying states @xcite .",
    "there have also been considerable successes in direct photoassociation to produce low - lying states @xcite .    in the other approach , represented for example by stark deceleration @xcite or helium buffer - gas cooling @xcite ,",
    "preexisting molecules are decelerated either by external fields or by collisions with other particles and trapped in electrostatic or magnetic traps .",
    "the temperature of the resulting molecular cloud is usually in the k - mk region , and therefore new ways for cooling the molecules further are being sought . a promising route to cooling decelerated molecules down to the @xmath1k region is offered by sympathetic cooling .",
    "sympathetic cooling , in which one species is cooled by thermal contact with another much colder species , was originally developed as a cooling technique for trapped ions @xcite .",
    "diatomic @xcite and polyatomic @xcite molecular ions have been cooled to sub - kelvin temperatures by thermal contact with cold ions , and sympathetic cooling is expected to be capable of cooling ions of very high mass , including those of biological relevance .",
    "sympathetic cooling has also been successful in producing ultracold neutral atoms of species that are not themselves suitable for evaporative cooling ; for example it was used to create the first bose - einstein condensates of potassium @xmath2k @xcite .",
    "sympathetic cooling is effective only if the rate of elastic collisions is very large compared to the rate of inelastic collisions .",
    "elastic collisions exchange kinetic energy between molecules and allow thermalization .",
    "however , inelastic collisions in which internal energy is converted into relative kinetic energy cause trap loss ( if the energy released is greater than the trap depth ) or heating ( if the energy released is less than the trap depth ) . magnetic and electrostatic traps always trap molecules in low - field - seeking states , which are not in their lowest state in the applied field .",
    "since typical traps have depths in the @xmath1k or mk range , most inelastic collisions cause trap loss .",
    "a commonly stated rule of thumb is that the ratio of elastic to inelastic collision rates must be at least 100 for effective sympathetic cooling .",
    "the obvious _",
    "coolants _ for the sympathetic cooling of cold molecules are alkali - metal atoms , which can be cooled to ultra - low temperatures on demand .",
    "sympathetic cooling of photoassociated alkali - metal dimers in triplet states by alkali - metal atoms was discussed by cvita _ _ et al.__@xcite , who concluded that the dimers would need to be in their ground rovibrational state because of the unfavorable ratio of inelastic to elastic cross sections in the sub - mk temperature region .",
    "sympathetic cooling of decelerated molecules by alkali - metal atoms was first considered by soldn and hutson @xcite , who studied the interactions of rubidium atoms with nh molecules .",
    "they showed that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states of rbnh ( bound by covalent and dispersion forces ) are crossed by much deeper @xmath5 and @xmath3 ion - pair states in the energetically allowed region at linear geometries .",
    "they concluded that the ion - pair states are likely to have important consequences for the physics of sympathetic cooling of molecules such as ch , nh and oh , because they provide additional mechanisms for inelastic collisions and three - body recombination .",
    "lara _ et al . _",
    "@xcite subsequently focused on the interaction of oh molecules with ultracold rb atoms .",
    "they developed full sets of coupled potential energy surfaces and carried out quantum collision calculations including spin - orbit and hyperfine coupling .",
    "once again they found a deep ion - pair state ( @xmath6 for rboh ) that crossed the covalent states at energetically accessible geometries .",
    "however , even when the ion - pair state was excluded from the calculation , the anisotropy of the potential for the covalent states was enough to cause strong inelastic collisions that would prevent sympathetic cooling except for atoms and molecules in their absolute ground states .",
    "_  concluded in general that ( i ) light atomic partners are desirable as coolants , because the resulting high centrifugal barriers would suppress many inelastic channels ; ( ii ) weak coupling of the electron to the axis , which occurs in hund s case b molecules such as nh or cah , would be beneficial ; ( iii ) the anisotropy of the atom - molecule surface should be comparable to or smaller than the rotational constant of the molecule ; and ( iv ) closed - shell coolants , such as alkaline - earth atoms , may produce more isotropic potential energy surfaces than open - shell coolants , such as alkali - metal atoms .",
    "later a detailed _ ab initio _ study of 2d adiabatic potential energy surfaces for nh interacting with rb and cs atoms was reported by tacconi _ _ et al.__@xcite , followed by studies of the quantum dynamics of ultra - low - energy collision processes @xcite .",
    "another set of potential coolants for sympathetic cooling are alkaline - earth atoms .",
    "calcium @xcite and strontium @xcite atoms can be cooled and trapped at temperatures of the order of @xmath1k .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have recently succeeded in cooling magnesium atoms to sub - doppler temperatures of 500 @xmath1k . to our knowledge",
    "no attempt has yet been made to cool be atoms .",
    "very recently , uchowski and hutson @xcite surveyed interactions of nh@xmath7 molecules with alkali - metal and alkaline - earth atoms .",
    "all the systems exhibited deep potential wells ( 890 to 5100 @xmath8 ) when the atom was on the n side of the molecule , and shallow potential wells ( 100 to 130 @xmath8 ) when the atom was on the h side , resulting in very strong anisotropy of the surfaces .",
    "this will produce strong inelasticity in the molecular rotational and inversion degrees of freedom and sympathetic cooling is unlikely to be successful for molecules in low - field - seeking states .",
    "in this paper we survey the possibilities for sympathetic cooling of nh molecules , which have very recently been cooled and magnetically trapped at 0.7 k in their ground @xmath9 state @xcite by buffer - gas cooling .",
    "nh molecules in their metastable @xmath10 state have also been stark - decelerated @xcite and electrostatically trapped at temperatures of 60 - 100 mk , and there is a proposal @xcite to transfer @xmath10 molecules to the @xmath9 state . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the interactions of nh(@xmath9 ) molecules not only with all the relevant alkali - metal ( alk ) atoms , but also for the first time with the alkaline - earth ( ae ) atoms .",
    "we characterize the potential energy surfaces of the covalent and dispersion - bound states of the alknh and aenh systems and locate their conical intersections with the ion - pair states .",
    "we show that be and mg atoms are promising candidates for sympathetic cooling of nh(@xmath9 ) molecules .",
    "to facilitate future quantum dynamics calculations , all results are reported in jacobi coordinates . the intermolecular distance @xmath11 is the distance between the alkali - metal or alkaline - earth atom and the center of mass of the nh molecule .",
    "the angle @xmath12 is measured at the center of mass and is zero for linear atom - hn geometries . in all our calculations the nh bond length @xmath13",
    "is fixed at the experimentally determined equilibrium value for the free monomer , 1.0367 @xcite .",
    "supermolecular coupled - cluster calculations were carried out using a single - reference restricted open - shell variant @xcite of the coupled cluster method @xcite with single , double and non - iterative triple excitations [ rccsd(t ) ] .",
    "all electrons from the `` outer - core '' orbitals ( 1@xmath14 , 2@xmath142@xmath15 , 3@xmath143@xmath15 , 4@xmath144@xmath15 , and 5@xmath145@xmath15 for li and be , na and mg , k and ca , rb and sr , and cs , respectively ) were included in the rcssd(t ) calculations .",
    "all the _ ab initio _ calculations were performed using the molpro package @xcite .    to describe the interaction between the outer - core and valence electrons , and to reduce basis - set superposition errors ,",
    "rather large basis sets are needed .",
    "we use the correlation - consistent polarized valence quintuple-@xmath16 ( cc - pv5z ) basis sets of dunning @xcite for hydrogen ( without the @xmath17 functions ) and for nitrogen ( without the @xmath18 functions ) . both these basis sets were augmented in an even - tempered manner and used in uncontracted form . for lithium , beryllium , sodium , magnesium , potassium , and calcium atoms",
    ", we use the correlation - consistent polarized core - valence quintuple-@xmath16 cc - pcv5z basis sets of iron _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , again without the @xmath18 functions .",
    "the li , be , na , and mg basis sets were used in fully uncontracted form and those for k and ca were used partially contracted .",
    "these basis sets were also augmented by additional even - tempered diffuse functions .",
    "the resulting aug - cc - pcv5z basis sets consist of ( 15@xmath14,10@xmath15,8@xmath19,6@xmath20,4@xmath17 ) , ( 20@xmath14,13@xmath15,9@xmath19,7@xmath20,5@xmath17 ) , and [ 13@xmath14,12@xmath15,9@xmath19,7@xmath20,5@xmath17 ] functions for li , na , and k , respectively , and of ( 15@xmath14,9@xmath15,8@xmath19,6@xmath20,4@xmath17 ) , ( 21@xmath14,15@xmath15,9@xmath19,7@xmath20,5@xmath17 ) , and [ 13@xmath14,12@xmath15,9@xmath19,7@xmath20,5@xmath17 ] functions for be , mg , and ca , respectively . for rubidium , strontium , and cesium , we use the small - core scalar relativistic effective core potentials ecp28mdf and ecp46mdf @xcite , together with the corresponding valence basis sets .",
    "these basis sets were augmented in the even - tempered manner and used in uncontracted form .",
    "the resulting basis sets consisted of ( 14@xmath14,11@xmath15,6@xmath19,4@xmath20,2@xmath17 ) , ( 15@xmath14,12@xmath15,7@xmath19,5@xmath20,2@xmath17 ) , and ( 13@xmath14,12@xmath15,6@xmath19,4@xmath20,3@xmath17 ) primitive gaussian functions for rb , sr , and cs , respectively .",
    "all interaction energies are calculated with respect to the separated - atom - molecule limit , with both the atom and the molecule in their ground states .",
    "the full counterpoise correction of boys and bernardi @xcite is used to compensate for basis set superposition errors .",
    "optimizations of the counterpoise - corrected dimer interaction energies are performed making use of a general optimization algorithm implemented in molpro .    in order to describe the dispersion - bound state of mgnh for all geometries , we use a version of symmetry - adapted perturbation theory ( sapt ) based on a density - functional theory ( dft ) description of the monomers . in the sapt(dft ) method @xcite ( which we use here only for mgnh ) , the interaction energy is obtained as a sum of contributions , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the electrostatic energy , @xmath24 is the first - order exchange energy , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the second - order dispersion and induction energies , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 are their exchange counterparts .",
    "the first - order terms are calculated using kohn - sham orbitals , while the dispersion , induction and exchange - induction terms are evaluated using coupled kohn - sham density susceptibilities .",
    "the exchange - dispersion term is estimated as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in ref.@xcite the second - order exchange corrections are given in the so - called @xmath29 approximation , which neglects terms of third and higher powers in the overlap matrix @xmath30 .",
    "since the overlap between mg and nh is large , we scale the second - order exchange corrections by @xmath31 .",
    "this procedure was introduced by patkowski _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to improve the performance of sapt for systems with very diffuse monomer densities .",
    "our sapt calculations use the pbe0 density functional @xcite , with augmented correlation - consistent polarized valence quadruple - zeta ( aug - cc - pvqz ) basis sets @xcite supplemented with bond functions 0.9,0.3,0.1 @xmath14 and @xmath15 , 0.6,0.2 @xmath19 and @xmath20 placed at the midpoint between the mg atom and the center of mass of nh .",
    "the tozer - handy asymptotic correction @xcite of the exchange - correlation potential is used , with splicing parameters 3.5 and 4.7   .",
    "in discussing the electronic structure of nh interacting with alkali metals ( alk ) , it is convenient to begin with linear arrangements . at linear geometries ( point group @xmath32 )",
    ", there are two covalent states @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which correlate with the alk(@xmath35 ) + nh(@xmath36 ) dissociation limit .",
    "these are crossed by an ion - pair @xmath37 state , which in a diabatic representation correlates with the alk@xmath38(@xmath39 ) + nh@xmath40(@xmath37 ) dissociation limit .",
    "( in an adiabatic representation this state changes configuration at a long - range avoided crossing with a higher @xmath37 state , and in the new configuration it correlates with alk(@xmath41 ) + nh(@xmath36 ) ; the ion - pair configuration is then carried up by a cascade of similar avoided crossings until it reaches the alk@xmath38(@xmath39 ) + nh@xmath40(@xmath37 ) dissociation limit ) . at non - linear geometries ( point group @xmath42 ) ,",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath34 states become @xmath4 and @xmath3 states , while the @xmath37 state is subject to the renner - teller effect and splits into two states with the electron hole either in the triatomic plane ( @xmath5 ) or perpendicular to it ( @xmath3 ) . in cuts through the potential at fixed n - h distance , the covalent @xmath3 and ion - pair @xmath3 states avoided - cross at nonlinear geometries but form a conical intersection at linear geometries . in the full three - dimensional picture they form a seam of conical intersections parameterized by the n - h distance .",
    "we consider first the quartet states .",
    "the potential curves for the @xmath33 states at linear alk - nh geometries are shown in fig .",
    "[ alknhfig ] .",
    "results from geometry optimization are given in table [ alknh ] for both linear configurations .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]                 another important feature is the position of the crossing between the dispersion - bound @xmath43 state and the ion - pair @xmath44 states .",
    "these are also tabulated in table [ aenh ] and shown in figs .",
    "[ aenhfig ] and [ aehnfig ] . for",
    "be - nh and mg - nh the crossing occurs fairly high on the repulsive wall of the @xmath36 state , while for ca - nh and sr - nh it occurs at negative energies ( in the potential well ) .",
    "this may be crucial for collisional properties .",
    "if the crossing is located at negative energies , as for ca - nh and sr - nh , the deep , strongly anisotropic ion - pair well may be accessed in low - energy collisions and is likely to result in strong inelasticity . on the other hand ,",
    "if the crossing occurs at a high energy in a classically inaccessible region , as for be - nh and mg - nh , the deep ion - pair well is accessible only by tunneling through a barrier and may not have a strong effect on collisions .    for ae - hn geometries , shown in table [ aenh ] ,",
    "the crossing occurs high on the repulsive wall for all the aenh systems .",
    "as shown above , the benh and mgnh systems have potential energy surfaces that appear promising for sympathetic cooling .",
    "however , mg has been successfully laser - cooled @xcite whereas be has not .",
    "we therefore focus in this section on developing a complete potential energy surface for interaction of mg with nh(@xmath45 ) .    for bent geometries near the conical intersection ,",
    "the two lowest triplet states of @xmath46 symmetry are near - degenerate . under these circumstances",
    "single - reference coupled - cluster calculations are inappropriate .",
    "one alternative , which we have previously applied for rboh @xcite , is to carry out multireference configuration interaction calculations including single and double excitations ( mr - cisd ) .",
    "however , for mgnh the contribution from triple excitations is extremely large : for example , the well depths of the linear @xmath45 state is underestimated by 40% in rccsd calculations .",
    "because of this , we use sapt(dft ) calculations to study nonlinear configurations of mgnh .",
    "it has recently been demonstrated @xcite that sapt(dft ) gives reasonably good results for mg@xmath47 , nh - he and mghe , and the polarizabilities and van der waals coefficients for mg@xmath47 are reproduced with an accuracy of a few percent .",

    "[ figmgnh ] shows the potential energy surface for mg  nh obtained from sapt(dft ) calculations .",
    "there are minima at both linear geometries and a saddle point between them , with a barrier of only 24 @xmath8 .",
    "the agreement between ccsd(t ) and sapt(dft ) methods for linear configurations is very good for the mg - nh geometry , where sapt(dft ) overestimates the rccsd(t ) well depth by 6% .",
    "the agreement is slightly worse for the mg - hn geometry , where sapt(dft ) underestimates the well depth by 9% ( see fig .",
    "[ saptcomp ] ) .",
    "the ion - pair state does not reach negative energies until distances @xmath48  .",
    "the dispersion - bound state is strongly repulsive at such distances .",
    "we have carried out multireference self - consistent field ( mcscf ) calculations of the two states of @xmath49 symmetry in the region of their avoided crossing for a range of angles using a cc - pvqz basis set @xcite .",
    "the lowest barrier for crossing onto the ion - pair state occurs for an angle @xmath50 at a distance of @xmath51   and an energy of @xmath52 @xmath8 with respect to the atom - molecule threshold .",
    "the singlet ion - pair state is about 700 @xmath8 shallower than the triplet near its equilibrium geometry and will therefore cross the dispersion - bound state at even higher energies .",
    "the collision energies of importance to sympathetic cooling are in the range between 1 @xmath1k and 100 mk ( 0.06 @xmath8 ) . at such energies",
    "we believe that the barrier separating the wells of the ion - pair and dispersion - bound states is wide and high enough to neglect the conversion from mgnh to mg@xmath53nh@xmath54 and to perform collision calculations only on the dispersion - bound surface .",
    "in this paper we have presented an overview of the interaction potentials of alkali - metal and alkaline - earth atoms with nh molecules in their ground @xmath45 state .",
    "the interaction potentials of quartet states of alknh systems are strongly anisotropic , with deep wells at alk - nh geometries .",
    "the bonding in the well region involves strong mixing of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 orbitals of the alkali - metal atom and is thus covalent in nature . for geometries close to alk - nh configurations",
    "the quartet states are crossed by ion - pair doublet states in the energetically accessible region . because of the presence of the ion - pair state , the lowest doublet adiabatic potential energy surface has a very deep well .",
    "the anisotropies for both doublet and quartet states are so large that it is unlikely that sympathetic cooling of nh by alkali - metal atoms will be successful for molecules in low - field - seeking states .    for alkaline - earth atoms the interaction potentials are much shallower and less anisotropic , especially for benh and mgnh .",
    "the @xmath55 mixing is much weaker and the bonding is dominated by induction and dispersion forces . for mgnh the anisotropy is comparable to or smaller than the rotational constant of nh , @xmath56 . for canh and srnh",
    "the anisotropy is rather larger , of the order of @xmath57 for canh and @xmath58 for srnh .",
    "the relatively weak anisotropy raises the hope that alkaline earth atoms could be used for sympathetic cooling of nh molecules .",
    "the dispersion - bound @xmath36 states of aenh systems are crossed by singlet and triplet ion - pair states @xmath59 and @xmath44 . at nonlinear geometries",
    "the @xmath36 state becomes @xmath49 and there is a component of the @xmath60 state of the same symmetry .",
    "the absolute minimum thus has ion - pair character in all cases . for canh and srnh the ion - pair state crosses the dispersion - bound state in the energetically accessible region , so that the adiabatic potential energy surfaces have a single - minimum structure with a deep potential well and strong anisotropy . for benh and mgnh ,",
    "however , the crossing occurs on the repulsive wall of the potential of the dispersion - bound state and the deep ion - pair well is likely to be inaccessible in low - energy collisions .",
    "we have calculated a full 2-dimensional potential energy surface for mgnh and verified that the crossing occurs on the repulsive wall at all geometries .    the benh and mgnh systems are thus promising candidates for sympathetic cooling . in future work",
    "we will carry out collision calculations on mgnh to explore this further .",
