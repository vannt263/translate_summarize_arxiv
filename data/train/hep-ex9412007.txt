    "various attempts to understand the cp violation mechanism[1 ] are presently being planned .",
    "@xmath0 mesons seem to be a most promising probes to be investigated[2 ] . in order to carry out such investigations ,",
    "b - factory projects have been proposed[3 ] .",
    "one of them is the kek b - factory project , in which asymmetric double storage rings to produce high - rate moving-@xmath1s will be constructed[4 ] . to measure cp asymmetry , we need to identify the b - flavor : in other words either @xmath0 or @xmath2 .",
    "the best probes have been found to be charged @xmath3 mesons from the cascade decays of @xmath0 mesons[5 ] .",
    "@xmath4/@xmath3 separations in the momentum range between 0.5 - 4 gev are required .",
    "in addition , a fast response of the detector is required , due to the use of a high - luminosity accelerator .",
    "we have adopted a fast ring imaging cerenkov detector ( in short ,  fast rich\"[6 ] ) for @xmath4/@xmath3 identification .",
    "solid photocathodes which can be operated even after exposure to air have recently been discovered ; they were also proven to be useful in a fast rich[7 ] .",
    "the most stable ( to air - exposure ) photocathode was found to be csi coated with a thin layer of tmae .",
    "however , the quantum efficiencies have not yet been established in the presence of air or mwpc - gases[8 ] .",
    "we have systematically carried out measurements of the quantum efficiencies of csi as well as other materials .",
    "the optimization of a csi photocathode and the search for other materials have been carried out .",
    "in order to measure the quantum efficiencies of various photo - sensitive materials , we have adopted a phototube technique . a test phototube ( diode )",
    "is shown in fig 1 .",
    "window were made of @xmath5 or quartz .",
    "the cathode was made of an al - plated - ni electrode , and various photo - sensitive materials were plated on it .",
    "tests were then carried out at room temperature .",
    "the spectral responses were measured using monochrometers .",
    "at first , we optimized the thickness of the csi photocathode .",
    "the quantum efficiencies were simultaneously monitored at a wavelength of 170 nm with vacuum - plating csi .",
    "the result is shown in fig 2 .",
    "the real thickness of the csi photocathode was calibrated , and the correction factor was typically @xmath630% .",
    "we therefore concluded that the optimized thickness was approximately 130 nm .",
    "this value is different from that of reference [ 7 ] about a factor of 4 .",
    "a factor of 2 can be explained by reflection at the al - surface of the electrode .",
    "there may be a systematic difference in the csi quantum efficiency due to such circumstances as gas .",
    "our measurement was carried out under a vacuum .",
    "we replaced the cathode - electrode with an stainless steel which has a higher reflectivity , however , the quantum efficiency was the same .    the spectral response of the quantum efficiency",
    "is shown in fig 3 .",
    "the points indicated by ( a ) were measured using a @xmath5 window and by ( b ) a quartz window .",
    "the peak is located at @xmath6120 nm ( qe=40% ) , where @xmath5 cutoff is 115 nm .",
    "the cste photocathode has been known to be sensitive at longer wavelengths and to have a higher qe than that of csi .",
    "this photocathode was tested with a quartz window phototube .",
    "although the optimized thickness was located at around 100 - 300 nm , this requires more study .",
    "the quantum efficiency was plotted with the points indicated by ( c ) in fig 3 .",
    "a qe of 55% was obtained at 200 nm .",
    "we next tested a tl - doped csi in order to find any difference in the spectral response .",
    "after that , @xmath5 windows were used in the test phototubes .",
    "the measurements were carried out at the optimized thickness . the measured quantum efficiency is shown in fig 4 .",
    "we did not observe any spectral differences , compared with those found in the pure csi .",
    "this photocathode was thus also proven to be stable .",
    "nai is known to have a lower work function ( eg ) , and slightly higher electron affinity ( ea ) .",
    "we anticipate the shift of the sensitivity at the longer wavelength region .",
    "the result is shown in fig 4 .",
    "unfortunately , the quantum efficiency is too low to be used in our case .",
    "[ [ ki ] ] ki ~~    ki has a similar eg and ea compared to that of nai .",
    "the result is shown in fig 4 .",
    "a quantum efficiency of 24% at @xmath6120 nm was obtained .",
    "however , the sensitivity in the longer wavelength region was significantly lower than that of csi .",
    "there is no effective sensitivity with a quartz window .",
    "in this chapter we report on the sensitivity changes occurring after exposing photosensitive materials to various gases .      at",
    "first we tried @xmath7 .",
    "after 1 hour of exposure to @xmath7 , the quantum efficiency was reduced by about 5% . in these measurements , the thickness of csi was 130 nm .",
    "the dependence on the thickness will be measured in the near future .",
    "we next tried @xmath8 , and a 50% reduction of the quantum efficiency was observed .",
    "@xmath9 was also tried .",
    "the sensitivity was found to be stable against exposure .",
    "csi was found to be stable against amin - gas .",
    "we finally we tried air exposure . the result is shown in fig 5 .",
    "we monitored the anode current at two wavelengths of light sources ( 121.6 and 160.8 nm ) .",
    "there were 5 steps : ( a ) before exposure , ( b ) after 1 hour of exposure , ( c ) 2 hours , ( d ) 3 hours , and ( e ) leaving the test photocathode for 5 days in vacuum after ( d ) .",
    "although the quantum efficiencies were reduced by the exposures , they recovered after more than 20 hours of vacuum pumping",
    ".    we tried yet another test .",
    "there was one exposure of 4 hours ; after that , the test photocathode was left in a vacuum .",
    "the results are shown in fig 6 .",
    "there was a drastic change in the sensitivity .",
    "the quantum efficiency became as high as 77% at @xmath6120 nm ( before exposure , it was only 40% ) .",
    "however , it was not stable after the vacuum - pumping .",
    "there was a possibility that some contamination in the air contributed to the increase in the quantum efficiencies of csi .",
    "we need to carry out a more systematic check of this effect .",
    "cste showed a similar result compared to that of csi regarding @xmath7 exposure .",
    "a 5% reduction of the quantum efficiency was observed .",
    "air exposure was serious , and the quantum efficiency dropped to less than 1% .",
    "csi was proven to be stable against air exposure .",
    "we thus tried to coat an unstable material with csi ( a double photocathode ) .",
    "the most promising uv photocathode was cste .",
    "it has a higher sensitivity at wavelengths greater than 200 nm .",
    "the advantage involves the use of a quartz window .",
    "we tried to coat cste with csi .",
    "unfortunately the result was negative .",
    "after plating a thin film of csi , cste itself reacted with csi and the quantum efficiency dropped rapidly , even in a vacuum . after air exposure , additional damage was observed .",
    "cssb was known to match csi in a vacuum , and it shows a good sensitivity to visible light .",
    "we tried to coat a cssb photocathode with csi [ 9 ] . at first in vacuum ,",
    "the coating was carried out by a few nm steps .",
    "after each step , the quantum efficiency was observed to be reduced by 10 - 20% .",
    "after 6 steps , we exposed it to air and then measured the quantum efficiency .",
    "it had become reduced by one order ( i.e. , less than 1% ) .",
    "we therefore concluded that we can not prevent a reaction with air by using a thin film of csi .",
    "nai was stable in air .",
    "we thus tried to coat nai with csi and csi with nai .",
    "this was a miscellaneous test in order to understand any changes in the quantum efficiencies by a coating procedure . in the first case ,",
    "the quantum efficiency at 170 nm was the same as that of pure csi , and that at 180 nm was half . in the latter case , however , the quantum efficiency at 170 nm was half and at 180 nm it was 1/4 .",
    "there was a reduction by the double - layer technique .",
    "we tested various photocathodes for gas - filled photon detectors , such as a ring - imaging cerenkov detector using test phototubes .",
    "various materials which were stable to air exposure were tested . among them , csi was found to be the most suitable , and various optimizations were carried out .",
    "other attempts , such as using new materials other than csi , or using double - layer photocathodes did not show any stable results .",
