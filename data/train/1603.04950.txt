    "developments in quantum technology and quantum information provide an important motivation for research in the area of quantum feedback control systems ; e.g. , see @xcite . in particular , in recent years , there has been considerable interest in the feedback control and modeling of linear quantum systems ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "such linear quantum systems commonly arise in the area of quantum optics ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "feedback control of quantum optical systems has applications in areas such as quantum communications , quantum teleportation , and gravity wave detection .",
    "in particular , _ linear quantum optics _ is one of the possible platforms being investigated for future communication systems ( see @xcite ) and quantum computers ( see @xcite and @xcite ) . feedback control of quantum systems aims to achieve closed loop properties such as stability @xcite , robustness @xcite , entanglement @xcite .",
    "quantum linear system models have been used in the physics and mathematical physics literature since the 1980 s ; e.g. , see @xcite .",
    "an important class of linear quantum stochastic models describe the heisenberg evolution of the ( canonical ) position and momentum , or annihilation and creation operators of several independent open quantum harmonic oscillators that are coupled to external coherent bosonic fields , such as coherent laser beams ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these linear stochastic models describe quantum optical devices such as optical cavities @xcite , @xcite , linear quantum amplifiers @xcite , and finite bandwidth squeezers @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we will refer to this class of models as _ linear quantum stochastic systems_. in particular , we consider linear quantum stochastic differential equations driven by quantum wiener processes ; see @xcite .",
    "further details on quantum stochastic differential equations and quantum wiener processes can be found in @xcite .",
    "this paper will survey some of the available results on the feedback control of linear quantum systems and related problems",
    ". an important class of quantum feedback control systems involves the use of measurement devices to obtain classical output signals from the quantum system and no quantum measurements is involved .",
    "these classical signals are fed into a classical controller which may be implemented via analog or digital electronics and then the resulting control signal act on the quantum system via an actuator .",
    "however , some recent papers on the feedback control of linear quantum systems have considered the case in which the feedback controller itself is also a quantum system .",
    "such feedback control is often referred to as coherent quantum control ; e.g. , see @xcite . due to the limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on the use of quantum measurement , the use of coherent quantum feedback control may lead to improved control system performance .",
    "in addition , in many applications , coherent quantum feedback controllers may be preferable to classical feedback controllers due to considerations of speed and ease of implementation .",
    "one motivation for considering such coherent quantum control problems is that coherent controllers have the potential to achieve improved performance since quantum measurements inherently involve the destruction of quantum information ; e.g. , see @xcite",
    ". also , technology is emerging which will enable the implementation of complex coherent quantum controllers ( e.g. , see @xcite ) and the coherent @xmath0 controllers proposed in @xcite have already been implemented experimentally as described in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , coherent controllers implemented using quantum optics have the potential to operate at much higher speeds than classical controllers implemented in analog or digital electronics .    in general , quantum linear stochastic systems represented by linear quantum",
    "stochastic differential equations ( qsdes ) with arbitrary constant coefficients need not correspond to physically meaningful systems . in contrast , because classical linear stochastic systems can be implemented at least approximately , using analog or digital electronics , we regard them as always being realizable .",
    "physical quantum systems must satisfy some additional constraints that restrict the allowable values for the system matrices defining the qsdes .",
    "in particular , the laws of quantum mechanics dictate that closed quantum systems evolve _ unitarily _ , implying that ( in the heisenberg picture ) certain canonical observables satisfy the so - called canonical commutation relations ( ccr ) at all times .",
    "therefore , to characterize physically meaningful systems , @xcite has introduced a formal notion of physically realizable quantum linear stochastic systems and derives a pair of necessary and sufficient characterizations for such systems in terms of constraints on their system matrices .    in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the physical realizability results of @xcite are extended to the most general class of complex linear qsdes .",
    "it is shown that this class of linear quantum systems corresponds to the class of real linear quantum systems considered in @xcite via the use of a suitable state transformation .",
    "the remainder of this paper proceeds as follows . in section [ sec : systems ] , we introduce the class of linear quantum stochastic systems under consideration and consider a number of different representations of these systems .",
    "we also introduce a useful special class of linear quantum systems which was considered in @xcite . in section [ sec : physical_realizability ] , we consider the issue of physical realizability for the class of linear quantum systems under consideration . in section [ sec :",
