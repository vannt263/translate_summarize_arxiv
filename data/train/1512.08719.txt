    "there has been a revival of interest in two - dimensional electron and hole systems with spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) motivated by recent developments in spintronics .",
    "the magnetic field induced by the soc may be tuned by varying the electric potential felt by the charge carriers in the crystal , thus providing a mechanism for spin current generation and manipulation .",
    "so far , two major types of soc mechanisms have been receiving the most interset ; the one resulting from the structure inversion asymmetry , or the rashba soc ( rsoc)@xcite , while the second is due to the bulk inversion asymmetry and known as dresselhaus soc ( dsoc)@xcite .",
    "an approach to investigate soc systems that has gained some popularity recently is the non - abelian gauge field formulation of the soc @xcite .",
    "the idea introduced in @xcite is based on noting that a linear soc ; @xmath1 can be expressed in terms of a non - abelian gauge field @xmath2 related to the electric field @xmath3 generating the soc as @xmath4 , ( @xmath5 is the momentum operator , @xmath6 s are the pauli spin matrices , and @xmath7 a constant related to the strength of the coupling ) , thus allowing one to write the hamiltonian using the covariant derivatives as in eq.([a ] ) below .",
    "this approach has the advantage of allowing one to avail from the well - established full machinery of dealing with non - abelian gauge fields ; where ideas like gauge transformations , gauge invariance .. etc .",
    "can be employed .",
    "many authors have exploited this approach efficiently to reveal some interesting properties of 2d spin one - half systems with soc .",
    "an interesting point in applying this approach to soc systems is the fact that the gauge field @xmath2 in this case - unlike the case in particle physics- is related to a physical field as is evident from its definition .",
    "therefore , a gauge transformation , for example , amounts to a change in a physical field configuration , so a gauge - symmetric hamiltonian describes systems with different field configurations that are unitarily - equivalent and iso - spectral . + more recently , spin one - half particle systems with soc in geometries other than planar started to attract attention as a result of the advances in nano technology which made it possible to synthesize objects like nano tubes and nano bubbles @xcite .",
    "it has been known for sometime that attempting to write down the soc hamiltonians for reduced geometries by blindly following the pragmatic approach , where one simply `` freezes '' one of the coordinates and writes the hamiltonian accordingly by dropping the corresponding derivatives gives rise to non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "therefore , many authors @xcite turned to the so - called thin layer quantization approach @xcite to formulate the correct hamiltonian on general curved geometries .",
    "this approach provides a systematic way of confining a system to a curved surface embedded in a full three dimensional general curvilinear coordinate system by introducing a confining potential to freeze the coordinate normal to the surface and decouple it from the surface hamiltonian .",
    "the results , however , are in most cases applied to to conventional geometries like ring , sphere and cylinder which can be described using _ orthogonal _ curvilinear coordinate systems . + the present work presents a new , simple and physics - based approach to address the problem of writing the hamiltonian of a spin one - half particle with _ linear _ soc confined to a surface that is embedded in a general _ orthogonal _ curvilinear coordinate(occ ) using the gauge field formulation of soc .",
    "it is based on the simple observation that when the particle is squeezed to a surface by a confining potential , then one drops from the hamiltonian the physical momentum transverse to he surface , rather than just the derivative of the transverse coordinate . in doing so",
    ", the surface hamiltonian acquires the well - known geometric potential and is rendered hermitian ; the geometric kinetic energy term emerges naturally as well .",
    "moreover , it is shown that for a constant soc the geometric potential is actually a coupling of the gauge field @xmath2 to the mean curvature of the surface , thus providing a physical interpretation of this term .",
    "+ in section 2 , the general formalism is introduced , and the hermitian hamiltonian with any linear soc on a surface embedded in a 3d space spanned by occ system is derived .",
    "three special geometries are then considered ; a cylinder , a sphere and a torus .",
    "general expressions valid for any linear soc for the hermitian hamiltonians on these surfaces are derived.section 3 applies the formalism to the rsoc , where the hermitian hamiltonians on the surfaces of a cylinder and a sphere reported earlier in the literature are derived , and the hamiltonian for the rsoc on the surface of a torus is worked out .",
    "discussion and conclusions are given in section 4 .",
    "+     near a torus surface . @xmath8 being the distance from the centre of the torus @xmath9 to the centre of the tube",
    ", @xmath10 is the radius of the tube and @xmath11 is the distance along the normal to the surface . ]",
    "the hamiltonian of a spin one - half particle of mass @xmath12 subject to a general linear spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) has the general form : @xmath13 where @xmath2 is a ( three)two - component non - abelian gauge field @xmath14 ( or @xmath15 ) with @xmath16 . in this work",
    "we will use @xmath17 to refer to group indices and @xmath18 to refer to space indices .",
    "evidently , the above hamiltonian is not gauge - invariant due to the presence of the gauge - symmetry breaking term @xmath19 @xcite . recall that in a source - free region @xmath20 as a result of @xmath21 . in a general orthogonal curvilinear coordinate ( occ ) with",
    "coordinates @xmath22 , this hamiltonian takes the explicit form : @xmath23 @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the well - known @xcite scale factors of the occ s defined in terms of the derivatives of the position vector @xmath26 as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 s are the orthogonal unit vectors of the occ system , and we use @xmath29 . a surface embedded in the space spanned by the occ",
    "is defined by setting one coordinate that has the dimensions of length ; @xmath30 say , ( thus has a scale factor @xmath31 ) to a constant , e.g.@xmath32 . confining the particle to this surface can then be achieved by introducing a confining potential @xmath33 - not shown in the above hamiltonian- that squeezes the particle into a thin layer around @xmath34 and then taking the limit @xmath35 . in a pragmatic approach to write down the hamiltonian of a particle thus confined to the surface , the derivatives @xmath36",
    "is set to zero in the above hamiltonian on the grounds that @xmath30 is a constant on the surface .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian is : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the laplacian operator at the surface .",
    "evidently , the above hamiltonian is not hermitian in the sense @xcite @xmath39 on the surface .",
    "moreover , this approach fails to generate the geometric kinetic energy term that appears in the thin layer quantization @xcite .",
    "+ we now , introduce a new approach to the problem , that is both physically sound and practical , and gives a hermitian hamiltonian with the geometric kinetic energy term emerging naturally .",
    "we start by noting that the physical momentum in the occ is not simply the non - hermitian operator @xmath40 !",
    "one can check easily that it is @xmath41 that turns out to be hermitian .",
    "now , noting the following two relations : @xmath42 , @xmath43 we can cast the hamiltonian , eq.([occ h ] ) , in the form : @xmath44 now , we make the following argument : soc has its physical origin as a coupling between the magnetic field induced in the rest frame of the moving particle by the electric field ( expressed in the original cartesian hamiltonian as a coupling with the gauge field;@xmath45 ) .",
    "therefore , as the confining potential squeezes the particle so that it is trapped at the surface , it is natural that it will not `` feel '' the magnetic filed due to its transverse motion since this motion is frozen . setting @xmath46 to zero in the above hamiltonian",
    "exactly achieves this by decoupling @xmath47 from the hamiltonian .",
    "moreover , the contribution of @xmath46 to the kinetic energy , i.e. the @xmath48 term also drops .",
    "the two surviving new terms in the above hamiltonian ; the second and the fifth , are respectively , the geometric kinetic energy @xcite and the geometric potential @xcite .",
    "indeed , one can check ( see the appendix ) that : @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the mean and the gaussian curvatures , respectively , in complete agreement with the thin layer quantization @xcite . as for the geometrical potential , it is easy to see that it is can be expressed as : @xmath52 which couples the gauge field to the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "since the confining potential freezes the transverse component of the momentum and at the same time introduces curvature into space by physically defining the surface , then we can view this term as `` replacing '' the coupling of the gauge field to the transverse momentum .",
    "this result supports the physical picture we are drawing . in the work @xcite , which discusses confining a particle in an electromagnetic field to a surface , similar term coupling the transverse component of the electromagnetic vector potential to the mean curvature was shown to appear . in that work , that term was undesirable as it represented a curvature contribution to the orbital magnetic moment of the particle . in our case",
    ", it does not carry such a meaning and its appearance is welcomed , even crucial as we now show .",
    "we first note that the condition @xmath20 implies for a _ constant cartesian vector _ @xmath2 that : @xmath53 where primes again indicates quantities on the surface and the absence of the third components . using this ,",
    "we can write the surface hamiltonian as :    @xmath54    the above equation provides the the most general hermitian hamiltonian with a linear soc on a surface in any occ system . we stress here that the last term in the above hamiltonian plays a crucial role in establishing hermicity .",
    "our equation ( [ div w ] ) provides the physical origin of this term .",
    "one can recast this hamiltonian using covariant derivatives in the form @xmath55 where we have defined the covariant derivatives @xmath56 , and the prime , again , denotes quantities on the surface and the absence of the 3-component .",
    "+ table [ table1 ] provides the h - factors , @xmath46 s and the geometric kinetic energies ( gke)for cylindrical , spherical and the torus ( see figure ) coordinates . the results for the gke s coincide with the well - known ones reported in the literature @xcite , and those for @xmath57 in cylindrical and spherical polar coordinates are the standard text book expressions for those operators .",
    "it is now straightforward to write down the hermitian hamiltonians in these three main occ systems .    .",
    "the h - factors , @xmath46 s and gke for cylindrical , spherical and torus coordinates .",
    "the expression for gke is calculated by setting @xmath58 at the surfaces of a cylinder and a sphere , and @xmath59 at the surface of the torus [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     so , we get the explicit hermitian hamiltonian on the surface of a cylinder ,    @xmath60    on the surface of a sphere , @xmath61 and finally on the surface of a torus : @xmath62 the hamiltonian for a ring of radius @xmath34 can be obtained from eq.([exp cyl ] ) by dropping the derivatives with respect to @xmath63 .",
    "eqs.([exp cyl ] ) and ( [ exp sph ] ) - as expressed in their expanded forms after the second equality signs- are exactly , eq.(16 ) and ( 19 ) , respectively , in reference @xcite .",
    "eq.([exp tor ] ) is reported for the first time to the best of our knowledge .",
    "the terms linear in @xmath64 and not coupled to the derivatives in each of the above equations are the geometric potentials reported in this and other references@xcite .",
    "we have proposed a new physical practical approach to construct the hermitian hamiltonian of a spin one - half particle with linear soc confined to a surface embedded in 3d in any occ system within the gauge field formulation of soc .",
    "the approach is based on the simple argument that as the particle is confined o a surface by a potential , then it is the transverse physical hermitian momentum operator that needs to be dropped from the hamiltonian rather than just the derivative with respect to the transverse coordinate as used to be done in the conventional practical approach to the problem .",
    "the approach , not only generates the geometric potential that renders the hamiltonian hermitian as well as the geometric kinetic energy term , it also provides a new physical interpretation of this geometric potential as a coupling of the transverse component of the gauge field to the mean curvature of the surface .",
    "as such , this approach substitutes the old practical approach to confine a particle to a surface embedded in 3d space spanned by an occ system based on simply dropping the derivative with respect to the transverse coordinate from the hamiltonian.it also can be considered as providing a physical interpretation for the very general and rigorous thin - layer quantization procedure .",
    "+ the development is simple , transparent and elegant : the main strength is that given any linear soc hamiltonian , we know now how to write down its corresponding hermitian version , it is just eq.([most general h ] ) .",
    "this last hermitian hamiltonian is the most general hermitian hamiltonian for any linear soc on a surface in any occ system .",
    "the hermitian hamiltonians for any linear soc on the three surfaces of practical value ; a cylinder , a sphere and a torus were provided , which furnish a plug - and - play formulae for any linear soc .",
    "the formalism is applied to the experimentally important 3d rsoc , where the hermitian hamiltonians on the surfaces of a sphere and a cylinder reported earlier by other methods are reproduced , and the hermitian hamiltonian on the surface of a torus is worked out .",
    "closing , we note that the present approach can be easily applied to other interactions , e.g. a particle coupled to a @xmath65 vector potential ( electromagnetic field ) .",
    "the applicability of the approach to general curvilinear coordinates - not necessarily orthogonal- should not be difficult either , but still needs to be carefully analyzed .",
    "these questions are under current investigation .",
    "in this appendix we give derivations to eq.([geometric k ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ geometric potential ] ) using classical differential geometry @xcite . to carry out our derivations , it is convenient to use notations from differential geometry of curved surfaces @xmath66 namely , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and set @xmath69 and hence the first fundamental form on the surface is @xmath70 while the second fundamental form is @xmath71 here , @xmath72 and @xmath73 @xmath74 being the normal vector to the surface .",
    "the left - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ geometric k ] ) , can be written as @xmath75 the above expression can be simplified using the lame s equations @xcite that are reduced to @xmath76 and @xmath77 . furthermore , using the fact that @xmath78 and @xmath79 , then eq . (",
    "[ geometric ka ] ) reads @xmath80 here , we used @xmath81 , @xmath82 corresponding to the mean curvature and curvature of the surface in the orthogonal curvilinear coordinates .",
    "we now move to derive eq .",
