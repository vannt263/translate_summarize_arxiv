    "they found the only possibly significant difference to be in their luminosities : the median luminosity of m31 gcs with x - ray sources was @xmath00.55 magnitudes higher than that of m31 gcs without .",
    "m31 x - ray gcs were slightly brighter in v than milky way x - ray gcs .",
    "@xcite speculated that this might associate x - ray sources with higher gc masses .",
    "we report on three bright x - ray sources in m31 , all associated with populous , old globular clusters : bo45 , bo135 and bo375 .",
    "we will argue that bo45 contains a good black hole ( bh ) candidate , while bo375 is likely to contain a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "bo135 is more likely to contain a ns , but we can not rule out a bh accretor .",

    "variability is only a few percent @xcite .",
    "this change in variability from low to high accretion rate is accompanied by a change in the emission spectra of lmxbs : low - state lmxbs have hard spectra that are characterised by power laws with photon index @xmath01.41.7 , regardless of the primary @xcite .",
    "higher accretion rates lead to distinctive emission spectra , depending on the accretor .",
    "bh lmxbs exhibit a thermally dominated state ( also known as the high / soft state ) where a 0.72 kev disc blackbody contributes @xmath690% of the 0.310 kev flux @xcite ; they also exhibit a `` steep power law '' state , where an additional power law component is observed , with a photon index @xmath11 @xcite .",

    "@xcite have systematically analysed observations of 40 disc - accreting neutron stars ( atoll class lmxbs and millisecond pulsars ) from the rxte database , in order to follow their spectral evolution as a function of luminosity .",

    "they found two different types of hard / soft transition : those where the spectrum softens at all energies , leading to a diagonal track on a colour - colour diagram , and those where only the higher energy spectrum softens , giving a vertical track .",

    "there were 20 sources with @xmath8100 epic - pn counts , and the probability of a gc coinciding with one of these by chance is @xmath444@xmath1310@xmath46 .",
    "we estimated the probability that the x - ray sources were agn by utilising the work of @xcite , who have modeled the agn flux distributions in the 12 kev and 210 kev bands .",
    "we found 0.33@xmath47 agn per square degree with 12 kev fluxes as high as the 12 kev flux of xbo45 ( 4.4@xmath1310@xmath48 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 ) , and 0.08@xmath49 agn per square degree with 210 kev fluxes as high for xbo45 ( 2.3@xmath1310@xmath50 erg @xmath15 s@xmath4 ) . even if we assume that none of these 210 kev sources are included in the 12 kev sources , and take the upper limits , then the spatial density of agn as bright as xbo45 is @xmath447@xmath1310@xmath51 per square arcsec ; the probability of such an agn coinciding with a gc is @xmath445@xmath1310@xmath52 .",
    "furthermore , xbo135 and xbo375 are more luminous than xbo45 , and they are even less likely to be agn .",
    "we also note that any agn , or indeed foreground star , would be very likely to distort the optical colours of the cluster .",
    "we therefore conclude that the x - ray sources are very probably associated with the gcs .",
    "we have examined the emission spectra and time variability of three x - ray sources associated with gcs in m31 , using the 2006 december 26 and 2007 january 2 xmm - newton observations .",
    "the emission of xbo45 is well described by a pure power law with photon index @xmath01.4 , and is highly variable .",
    "this is consistent with a ns or bh lmxb in the low state @xcite , but is not consistent with a bh lmxb in the high state or steep power law state ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references within ) , or a ns lmxb emitting at @xmath810@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated a distance to m31 of 784 kpc , @xmath113 kpc of statistical error , @xmath117 kpc of systematic error . combining these distance uncertainties",
    "adds further uncertainties in the source luminosities of @xmath15% .",
    "therefore , the 0.310 kev luminosity range for xbo45 is 2.5@xmath10.2@xmath1310@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 , or 140@xmath110% of the eddington limit for a 1.4 m@xmath12 neutron star primary .",
    "however , several lmxbs have been found to contain neutron stars with mass as high as @xmath02.1 m@xmath12 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; xbo45 has a 0.310 kev luminosity of @xmath080% eddington for such systems . since @xcite showed that transitions in neutron star lmxbs occur at @xmath210% eddington , we consider xbo45 to exhibit low state behaviour at an apparent luminosity too high for a neutron star .",
    "we therefore identify the accretor in xbo45 as a bh candidate .",
    "we note that xbo45 has been observed several times by the einstein and rosat observatories over the last @xmath53 years , varying in luminosity only by a factor of @xmath02 .",
    "this behaviour is consistent with that predicted for a gc bh binary formed by tidal capture @xcite .",
    "the observed two component emission of xbo375 is consistent with a bright ns lmxb , but not a low state ns or bh lmxb , nor a bh in the high or steep power law states .",
    "hence , we classify xbo375 as a ns lmxb .",
    "finally , the emission spectrum of xbo135 is consistent with a pure power law with photon index @xmath01.6 , but the fit is significantly improved by adding a blackbody component .",
    "hence , xbo135 is consistent with a ns or bh lmxb , and deeper observation is required for further classification .     of the thirteen bright x - ray sources in galactic gcs ,",
    "twelve have exhibited x - ray bursts , confiming their natures as ns lmxbs ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "@xcite conducted a survey of xmm - newton observations of x - ray sources associated with m31 gcs , looking for x - ray bursts .",
    "they found simultaneous pn and mos detections of bursts in two sources , and several burst candidates that were detected in the pn only .",
    "such bursts would be identifiable in the lightcurves of our target sources . however , x - ray bursts are thought to be forbidden at luminosities @xmath8 50% eddington @xcite , hence we do not expect bursts from xbo135 or xbo375 .",
    "xbo45 exhibits low - state behaviour at luminosities @xmath010 times higher than expected for 1.4 m@xmath12 ns lmxbs ; xbo135 may also .",
    "a composite of two or three bright x - ray sources would likely result in a different spectrum to that observed in xbo45 ; hence , if xbo45 were a composite , it would be more likely to be made from @xmath010 ns lmxbs in the low state .",
    "@xcite calculated the probability for a gc to contain multiple bright x - ray sources : they argue that if @xmath54 is the probability of finding one bright x - ray source in a gc , then poisson statistics dictate that probability for two bright x - ray sources should be @xmath54/2 , while the probability for 3 bright x - ray sources should be @xmath55/6 . for a @xmath54 @xmath00.10.2 ,",
    "@xcite predict 35 gcs with 2 x - ray sources and less than 1 with 3 x - ray sources in m31 .",
    "it is therefore very unlikely that xbo45 combines the emission of @xmath010 low - state neutron star lmxbs .",
    "it is however possible that the emission from xbo45 is anisotropic .",
    "it exhibits low - state spectra at luminosities @xmath01020 times higher than expected for neutron star lmxbs ; hence it could simply be beamed by a factor of 1020 . in this case",
    ", the emission would be restricted to a small solid angle ; one might expect to observe such beaming in @xmath0510% of randomly oriented systems .",
    "@xcite modeled the spectra of 43 m31 gcs .",
    "if we loosely class a low - state spectrum as a power law with @xmath19 @xmath361.7 , then @xcite found 20 gcs consistent with low - state spectra .",
    "five of those , xbo5 , xbo82 , xbo135 , xbo153 and xbo386 exhibited apparent luminosities @xmath810@xmath7 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "if we include xbo45 , then 6 out of 21 gc systems consistent with low - state spectra ( including xbo45 ) , have measured luminosities @xmath810@xmath7 , i.e. @xmath030% , a significantly larger fraction than expected from beaming .",
    "we note that the host cluster bo45 , which contains a bh lmxb candidate , is significantly larger than the cluster bo375 ( see section 3.2 ) , which we think contains a ns lmxb .",
    "@xcite describe bo375 as not at all unusual , with parameters close to the median of m31 gcs .",
    "this suggests that bo45 ( and also bo135 ) are particularly massive , and may therefore be more prone to forming bh lmxbs . therefore we conclude that , unlike the milky way , at least one gc in m31 is likely to contain a black hole binary .",
