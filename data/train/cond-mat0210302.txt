    "in the past few years , numerous studies of the effects of a quantizing magnetic field in low - dimensional systems , especially in quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) organic conductors have been performed ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "their interpretation is based on the existence of negligibly small chemical potential oscillations with magnetic field owing to the quasi-1d part of fermi surface which plays the role of an infinite reservoir of states .",
    "the assumption of a fixed chemical potential is consistent with the information provided by the inverse sawtooth wave form of the magnetization oscillations observed in the same compound  @xcite , which is a strong indication of negligibly small chemical potential oscillations ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "@xcite , we have also studied numerically the temperature dependence of the resistivity maxima . the presence of a pseudo - gap for high - magnetic fields gives rise at finite temperature to a thermally activated behavior of conductivity minima at @xmath84 . indeed , according to eq .",
    "( 19 ) and when @xmath84 ( then the minima of @xmath90 are in correspondence with the maximum of @xmath107 ) , the main means of conduction is the thermal excitation of quasiparticles at the edges of the pseudo - gap .",

    "for the numerical study of preceding section , we have assumed that the oscillations of the self - energy are negligibly small in the 2d limit @xmath72 .",
    "the purpose of this section is to justify such a choice in the organic compound @xmath9 .",
    "the impurity self - energy is derived in the so - called self - consistent born approximation . in quasi-2d metals , we usually have to take into account of the presence of an internal reservoir of states  @xcite . for short - range impurity scatterers ,",

    "such that @xmath140 , the higher order diagrams contributions become important and have also to be taken into account in the impurity self - energy calculations . as a result , the density of states is proved to be finite at any energy and for arbitrary magnetic fields .    however , for @xmath141 , we note that the unphysical cut - off for the impurity self - energy does not exist .",
    "this can be shown by rewriting eq .",
    "( 30 ) as @xmath142 this equation admits solutions for the whole range of energy @xmath26 and for any magnetic fields when @xmath143 .",
    "thus , it is always possible to find a finite impurity self - energy at arbitrary energy and magnetic fields .",
    "for this reason , we consider in the present paper that in the 2d limit the oscillations of @xmath127 are given by eq .",

    "as expected , the oscillations amplitude increases with the magnetic field ( see fig . [ fig4 ] )",
    ". however , for @xmath145 , oscillations of self - energy @xmath127 are relatively small compared to @xmath146 even at magnetic fields of about 60 t. in absence of other informations about the importance of the reservoir s influence on self - energy oscillations , we consequently assume at this level that oscillations of @xmath127 are small in experiments of ref .",
    "numerical treatment of eq . ( 19)-(21 ) allows comparison with experiments  @xcite .",
    "theoretical calculations with negligibly small self - energy oscillations reproduce well the appearance of huge oscillations in the same conditions of temperature and magnetic fields as in experiments  @xcite . as demonstrated in third section , the thermally activated behavior of @xmath19 maxima is theoretically established in correspondence with the observations of ref .",
    "furthermore , the minimum value of magnetic field to have thermal activation , i.e. @xmath147 , is in quantitative agreement with experiment ( in the conditions of experiment  @xcite , it corresponds to a magnetic field of about 20 t ) .",
    "nevertheless , we notice that there exist some discrepancies between our calculations and experiment  @xcite especially at very low temperatures . indeed , our numerical calculations do not qualitatively reproduce the behavior at very low temperatures of the resistivity minima , which are increasing with the magnetic field ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] of the present paper and fig . 1 of ref .",
    "quantitative departures from experiment are also found for the resistivity maxima at very low temperatures .",
    "a reason for the latter may be the consideration of negligibly small self - energy oscillations in our calculations . indeed , although the presence of self - energy oscillations does not suppress the thermally activated behavior of @xmath19 maxima , it induces quantitative modifications for the pseudo - gap value and thus for the resistivity maxima .",
    "however , this can not qualitatively explain the field dependence of the resistivity minima at very low temperatures .    a possible limitation of our model to describe the experimental signal  @xcite is the consideration of point - like impurity scattering , which enables to neglect the vertex corrections . indeed ,",
    "starting from a microscopic model with the energy spectrum ( 1 ) ( i.e. a 3d model ) , we find that in presence of point - like impurity scattering the behavior of the magnetic quantum oscillations of @xmath0 is fully dictated for magnetic fields @xmath148 by the 2d in - plane motion . under the same condition and in a parallel direction ,",
    "the equation for the density of states of the quasi-2d metal investigated with the self - consistent born approximation takes also a 2d form . on the other hand , in the pure 2d case",
    ", the treatment of the impurity effects on the magnetic quantum oscillations by a short - range impurity scattering is known to be no more valid at high magnetic fields to describe accurately the density of states . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , when typically the magnetic length @xmath149 , it becomes necessary to include also the effects of the impurity scattering on finite range @xmath138 in the calculations of the density of states .",
    "probably , specific contributions due to the finite - range impurity scattering have also to be taken into account in the calculations of the magnetoconductivity oscillations in high magnetic fields . in our opinion",
    ", such an open question might explain why our present calculations do not seize the complete correct behavior of magnetic quantum oscillations of @xmath19 in the high field regime .",
    "so far , we did not discuss the possible effects of the chemical potential oscillations on the magnetoconductivity oscillations .",
    "as declared in introduction , the dhva signal  @xcite gives strong support for negligibly small chemical potential oscillations in the organic compound @xmath9 , what we use at the final stage to perform the numerical calculations .",
    "the mechanism responsible for fixing the chemical potential is not clearly established .",
    "actually , this question is directly related to the theoretical problem just evoked above of the density of states of a 2d metal in high quantizing magnetic fields .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the value of the pseudo - gap appearing in the zero - temperature magnetic field - dependence of @xmath0 depends strongly on the presence of chemical potential oscillations . in third section",
    ", it was shown that in the limit @xmath150 the magnetoconductivity @xmath83 vanishes everywhere but at @xmath151 .",
    "in a pure metal in absence of reservoir , the chemical potential is pinned to the landau levels , i.e. @xmath152 when varying the magnetic field .",
    "therefore @xmath0 does not vanish , except when the chemical potential jumps .",
    "thus , in the pure ( unrealistic ) case , the pseudo - gap in @xmath0 is reduced to a point and there is no thermally activated behavior for the conductivity minima . in a real system , the chemical potential oscillations at zero temperature lead to a smaller pseudo - gap value than that obtained at a constant chemical potential . although no full quantitative agreement between our numerical calculations and experiment has been found for the pseudo - gap value , the observation  @xcite of a well developed thermally activated regime with a relatively important pseudo - gap value seems accordingly consistent with the existence of negligibly small chemical potential oscillations .",
    "we point out that the observation of a drastic change in the temperature and magnetic field behavior of @xmath0 oscillations is a unique feature of the 2d limit with energy spectrum ( 1 ) .",
    "since the switch between the two regimes occurs for @xmath153 , this necessarily implies that @xmath154 .",
    "such a condition is exactly expected to be reached in the organic compound @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the same condition is proposed for having incoherent interlayer transport  @xcite . in that case ,",
    "the existence of an interlayer dispersion in the energy spectrum ( 1 ) , or in other words the fermi liquid description , is questioned .",
    "it was with such an idea that authors of ref .",
    "@xcite attempted to extract a background magnetoresistance superposed with sdh oscillations . in a recent experiment",
    "@xcite performed with the same organic compound as concerned here , another arguments in favor of incoherent transport have been proposed to interpret observations of the angular dependence of @xmath19 in high magnetic fields .",
    "however , we notice that the coherent magnetotransport in quasi-2d compounds is usually discussed in frame of the boltzmann transport theory . here",
    ", we clearly find important discrepancies between the results obtained with the quantum transport theory and those obtained with the boltzmann transport theory especially in high magnetic fields @xmath148 and @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , theoretical studies developed exclusively in frame of the quantum transport theory are needed to better understand the possible unconventional quantum features of coherent magnetotransport in low - dimensional systems . as for the possible absence of the quasi - particle description at @xmath156 in the quasi-2d metals  @xcite ,",
    "one can notice that there is no doubt concerning the quasi - particle concepts in the pure 2d case where @xmath137 , and the only criterion for this rests on the fermi energy : @xmath157 .",
    "it seems that the possibility of an interlayer motion at @xmath158 does not spoil the quasi - particle description because the in - plane scattering just leads to the undetermination @xmath159 of the in - plane momentum ( @xmath160 is the velocity at the fermi surface ) but not to the indetermination of the interplane quasi - momentum @xmath161 .",
    "this explains in our opinion the observations of the coherence in the quasi-2d organic conductor @xmath162 reported at @xmath163 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , the importance of the contribution @xmath67 in the 2d limit and in high - quality layered conductors demonstrated in section iii prevents from separating the magnetoconductivity @xmath0 into a field oscillating part and a steady part in the manner used by the authors of ref .",
    "the relation of proportionality between the derivative of dhva signal and sdh signal assumed in ref .",
    "@xcite breaks down in high magnetic fields and in low - dimensional systems .",
    "this already occurs for @xmath21 due to small self - energy oscillations in absence of reservoir  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , even in presence of negligibly small self - energy oscillations , the relation of proportionality may not be valid . in this latter case the integration over energy @xmath26 in ( 17 ) can be performed analytically and yields for the oscillating part of the contribution @xmath45 in the 2d limit : @xmath164 where we have introduced @xmath165 in quasi-2d metals , the magnetization oscillations @xmath166 are given in the 2d limit by  @xcite @xmath167 from eq .",
    "( 33 ) and ( 35 ) , we can derive ( in the case of negligibly small chemical potential oscillations ) a relation valid at any temperature between the derivative of @xmath166 and the oscillating part of the contribution @xmath45 by keeping only the rapidly oscillating terms : @xmath168 in the dirty limit @xmath133 , it has been shown in section ii that @xmath67 contributes negligibly to total conductivity , i.e. @xmath169 , so that the sdh oscillations are approximatively proportional to @xmath170 , exactly as in 3d metals . when @xmath171 , the contribution @xmath67 becomes quite important and there is then no more simple correspondence between dhva and sdh signals",
    "we have investigated the oscillations of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity in quasi-2d organic metals for impurity scattering on short - range in a perpendicular quantizing magnetic field .",
    "huge magnetoresistance oscillations with unconventional magnetic field and temperature dependences have been found in high magnetic fields and for low temperatures in layered conductors whose interlayer hopping integral @xmath22 . in particular",
