    "modern semiconductor technology has allowed to fabricate and manipulate electrons confined within regions of nanometer size having a plethora of shapes .",
    "the possibility of tunning the shape , size and number of bound electrons of those nanostructures has raised a great deal of interest on the subject of the confined low - dimensional few - electron systems known as quantum dots ( qds ) @xcite either for specific applications or exploring new fundamental phenomena at a quantum level @xcite .",
    "quantum dots have been also termed `` artificial atoms '' because their electronic structure and properties resemble those of natural atoms @xcite .",
    "electrons in quantum dots are confined due to potential barriers , in much the same way as electrons in atoms are confined due to coulomb nuclear attraction .",
    "further similarities arise because electrons within quantum dots interact with each other through coulomb forces , their energy spectra present both discrete and continuum states giving rise to binding and dissociation processes , while transitions between them give rise to emission and absorption of radiation .",
    "thus it is justified , to some extent , to apply _mutatis mutandis_ methods of atomic or molecular physics to the study of these systems of electrons acted upon by a given confining potential .",
    "a spherically symmetric confining potential can provide a model for semiconductor spherical nanocrystals embbeded within an insulator @xcite . in the literature dealing with calculations of electronic structure and properties of qds ,",
    "a confining harmonic potential model is the most ubiquitous one .",
    "this can be justified on the basis of a generalized kohn s theorem @xcite satisfied by such a potential and , approximately , verified by experiments .",
    "a potential of this type allows to explain the electronic shell structure observed , _",
    "e.g. _ , in small clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the infinite height and range of a parabolic potential is clearly unphysical and allows to accomodate an infinite number of bound electrons , what precludes the consideration of binding and dissociation processes .",
    "other finite - range models have been also advocated ; _",
    "e.g. _ , the energy spectra of two- and three - electron systems in a spherical potential well of finite depth was obtained variationally @xcite , and the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) method was applied to the same model for the calculation of the electronic structure of systems having up to 20 electrons @xcite .",
    "more recently , the uhf calculation of ground state , chemical potential and charging energies of electrons in an infinite spherical potential well , with and without magnetic field , was reported @xcite . however , the sharp discontinuity at the qd radius for such a potential well is not completely satisfactory from neither a physical nor a computational point of view , and some interpolating potentials @xcite as well as smoothly varying potentials have been proposed @xcite . among them ,",
    "the gaussian potential has received some attention and its one- @xcite and two - electron spectra @xcite have been calculated .",
    "furthermore , this potential is particularly suitable for an atomic - like treatment such as uhf calculations .",
    "the hartree - fock method is one of the most widely used methods for the calculation of electronic structure of atoms and molecules .",
    "its usual implementation consists in the expansion of the unknown orbitals as a linear combination in a given basis set .",
    "the method thus determine self - consistently the energy eigenvalues and the orbitals .",
    "in atomic problems , the most common basis sets are spherical or cartesian gaussian functions because they provide closed expressions for the matrix elements of the atomic hamiltonian .",
    "such an advantage holds even more when the confining potential is gaussian itself .",
    "hence , we take in this work an atomic - like approach for the calculation of the electronic structure of few - electron gaussian quantum dots",
    ". such an approach shall be particularly advantageous when dealing with , _",
    "e.g. _ , systems of coupled quantum dots , and also for the analisys of mixed systems , like molecules coupled to qds .",
    "work along that line will be published elsewhere . on the other hand ,",
    "such a methodology is the starting point for a systematic improvement in the treatment of correlation effects by , _",
    "e.g. _ higher - order perturbation theory or multi - reference methods @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of few electrons confined by a potential assumed in the form of a spherically symmetric gaussian potential well of a typical radius @xmath4 and finite depth @xmath5 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath6 .",
    "it approaches a parabolic behavior around its minimum while goes smoothly to zero at infinity . in ref",
    "@xcite the parabolic approximation @xmath7 was considered for comparison , where @xmath8 relates the frequency @xmath9 of the harmonic oscillator corresponding to the gaussian exponent @xmath10 .",
    "the schrdinger equation for a system of @xmath1 electrons confined within the gaussian well and interacting through coulomb potentials is @xmath11\\psi = e\\psi,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the effective electron masses , and @xmath13 is the medium dielectric constant @xmath14 . by introducing donor bohr radius @xmath15 as the unit of length and donor rydberg @xmath16 ry as the unit of energy , eq .",
    "( [ sch eq ] ) becomes @xmath17\\psi = \\varepsilon\\psi,\\ ] ] such that the results can be easily transferred between different materials by properly changing @xmath18 and @xmath19 ; for instance , for a gaas semiconductor qd , one has @xmath20 mev and @xmath21 nm . + the existence of bound states of eq .",
    "( [ sch eq 2 ] ) depends on the radius and depth of the gaussian potential .",
    "if both magnitudes are small enough , even a single electron can not form a stable bound state . some physical insight on the stability of one- and few - electron qds",
    "can be gained from a simple variational estimate .",
    "the discussion will also prove to provide a useful starting point for the systematic construction of basis sets used in the more complicated many - electron calculations reported below .",
    "let @xmath22 be the ground state energy of a @xmath1-electron qd .",
    "let us estimate variationally the ground state energy of one electron in a gaussian potential .",
    "taking into account that , around its center , the gaussian potential resembles a parabolic one , we propose a a normalized @xmath23-type gaussian trial function of exponent @xmath24 @xmath25 the deeper the well , the more similar its ground state is to that of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "the expectation value of the one - electron hamiltonian then becomes @xmath26 where the first and second terms are the mean values of the kinetic energy and the confining potential , respectively .",
    "minimization with respect to @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath27 , gives @xmath28 which has to be solved numerically for given @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq for alpha ] ) has five roots but , typically , the one that minimizes @xmath31 , is a positive number of the order of unit @xmath32 .",
    "the other roots can be rejected on a physical basis because whether they are complex conjugate pairs , or real but negative or very close to zero and , hence , the corresponding trial functions do not describe bound states .",
    "thus , within this variational approach , the energy of a single - electron qd is @xmath33 on the other hand , the ground state of a two - electron qd corresponds to one electron with spin @xmath34 and the other with spin @xmath35 and interacting with each other through the coulomb interaction @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy shift of the one - electron levels due to the coulomb interaction between two gaussian charge densities @xmath39 the condition of stability of the two - electron qd discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and applied in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xmath40 , is equivalent to @xmath41 we shall discuss thoroughly the conditions for stability below when considering the results for few - electron qds . + in the calculations reported in this work",
    "we have considered both one- and few - electron systems .",
    "the former were used for benchmark purposes and provide a systematic way for calibrating the method .",
    "a one - electron gaussian potential of @xmath42 and @xmath43 has been considered by various authors for the comparison of the methods proposed in the literature .",
    "we also address such a case as our first calculation to assess the accuracy of our methodology .",
    "the first issue to be considered is the choice of a suitable cartesian gaussian basis set @xmath44 , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the angular momentum of the function .",
    "hereafter we use the spectroscopic notation @xmath23 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 for @xmath50 , thus @xmath51    the one - electron qds were solved by direct diagonalization of the hamiltonian , while the many - electron systems were treated with the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) method . the calculations for a given potential , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a given pair ( @xmath30,@xmath29 ) , were performed with the same basis sets , irrespective of the number of electrons .",
    "+ the prescription for the choice of the basis is based on the previously discussed variational energy expression [ eq .",
    "( [ e_alpha ] ) ] , and the optimal exponent @xmath52 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq for alpha ] ) ] .",
    "the values of @xmath52 for the three cases considered in this paper are listed in table [ potenciales ] .",
    "those exponents were then used to generate the basis functions with higher angular momentum , _ i.e. _ , we choose @xmath53 .",
    "this procedure can be justified as long as the gaussian potential is similar to the parabolic potential , whose solutions are hermite polynomials multiplied by gaussian functions with an exponent independent of the principal and angular quantum numbers @xmath54 and @xmath55 , thus exactly satisfying the prescription given above . by including one gaussian function with the optimized exponent in each angular momentum block up to a maximum value @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath57 , the low - lying states are reasonably well reproduced as compared to previously reported values .",
    "in particular , the ground state energy is correct within @xmath58 approximately , as expected , because of the variational procedure for obtaining the basis exponents .",
    "generally , states having @xmath59 are missing or , if obtained , have the larger errors .",
    "this is also a consequence of the fact that the low - lying states of the parabolic and gaussian potentials are alike , but those of high angular momentum are not .",
    "hence , to get a correct description of high - lying excited states , functions with the corresponding angular momentum @xmath55 have to be included . in atomic and molecular calculations ,",
    "a useful procedure for enlarging the basis set has been the so - called _ even - tempered _",
    "criterion @xcite by which a basis set having various functions of the same angular momentum has their exponent in the same ratio , _",
    "i.e. _ , for a given @xmath55 , the exponents @xmath60 are in the ratio @xmath61 . in the limit of a large number of functions",
    "the basis set should become complete , independently of the ratio chosen .",
    "we take arbitrarily a ratio of 2 to enlarge every block of angular momentum in the original basis set , thus including exponents @xmath62 @xmath63 smaller than the optimized one .",
    "a value of @xmath64 has been enough to reach converged energies within @xmath65 for all the calculations reported here . in summary ,",
    "the basis set used in all calculations consists of a set @xmath66 , with @xmath67 and @xmath68 , having 140 cartesian gaussian functions .",
    "+    .[potenciales ] values of the parameters @xmath29 and @xmath30 for the gaussian potentials studied .",
    "the radii of the quantum dots are given by @xmath69 .",

    "the upper curve represents the critical uhf line .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the fit @xmath79 .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] ]",
    "in summary , we have calculated the electronic structure of electrons confined in a gaussian qd by using the uhf method in its pople and nesbet s form .",
    "we gave a systematic procedure for constructing the basis set for the self - consistent calculations from the one - electron problem and with a given precision .",
    "the orbital energies provide an insight of the occupancy of the levels and show the fulfillment of hund rule in agreement with previous results obtained with other models @xcite .",
    "since the gaussian potential has a finite depth , binding and dissociation processes can occur .",
    "the criterion for the stability of a @xmath1-electron system was already discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite in terms of its energy @xmath22 as compared to @xmath80 . the condition @xmath81 is equivalent , in uhf calculations , to the condition that the highest - occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) is bound , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath82 , as a consequence of the koopman s theorem @xcite",
    ". if the electron - electron interaction can be neglected , the regions of the @xmath83 plane , having @xmath1 bound electrons , are delimited by the relation @xmath84 .",
    "this feature has been proven to be a widely valid property , as a consequence of the scaling properties of the confining potential .",
    "both the chemical potential and the charging energy show a shell structure with peaks of stability at @xmath3 , 5 and 8 , corresponding to filled and half - filled shells .",
    "both magnitudes decreases as the confinement range increases .",
    "the methodology applied in this work to single qds , can straightforwardly be transferred to the study of the electronic structure and properties of qds arrays .",
    "it is also amenable for considering correlation effects with standard atomic methods .",
