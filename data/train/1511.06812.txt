    "we prove the theorem when @xmath2 is two - dimensional .",

    "the notion of polar curve of a complex analytic function defined on an open neighborhood of @xmath37 relatively to a linear form @xmath38 were introduced by b. teissier and the first author in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "later , in @xcite m. kato and the first author extended this concept to a germ of complex analytic function @xmath10 relatively to a whitney stratification @xmath27 of a reduced equidimensional complex analytic space @xmath2 .",
    "notice that by now we are not supposing that @xmath11 has an isolated singularity in the stratified sense .",
    "this hypothesis will be asked after the lemma below .",
    "let @xmath39 be a representative of the germ of function at @xmath12 such that @xmath2 is closed in an open neighborhood @xmath30 of @xmath12 in @xmath40 .",
    "for any linear form : @xmath41 the function @xmath11 and the restriction of @xmath38 to @xmath2 induce the analytic morphism : @xmath42 defined by @xmath43 , for any @xmath44 .",
    "we have the following lemma :    [ lemma_polar_curve ] there is a representative @xmath2 of @xmath45 in an open neighborhood @xmath30 of @xmath37 and a non - empty zariski open set @xmath46 in the space of non - zero linear forms of @xmath40 to @xmath47 that take @xmath19 to @xmath21 such that , for any @xmath48 , the analytic morphism @xmath49 satisfies :    * the part of the critical locus of the restriction of @xmath50 to a stratum @xmath51 that lies outside @xmath52 is either empty or a smooth reduced complex curve , whose closure in @xmath2 is denoted by @xmath53 . *",
    "the image @xmath54 of @xmath55 by @xmath50 is the germ of a complex curve .",
    "let us choose an open neighborhood @xmath30 in @xmath37 such that the intersection @xmath56 is not empty for finite many indices @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , we may assume that the closure @xmath58 in @xmath30 is defined by an ideal @xmath59 generated by complex analytic functions @xmath60 defined on @xmath30 , that is , @xmath61 .",
    "now consider a linear form @xmath62 and a stratum @xmath51 such that @xmath63 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the critical set of the restriction of @xmath50 to @xmath65 .",
    "we will show that @xmath64 is contained in a member of a linear system parametrized by @xmath38 .",
    "consider the matrix :    @xmath66    a point @xmath67 of @xmath51 is a point where the rank of @xmath68 at @xmath67 is @xmath69 , since it is a non - singular point of @xmath58 .",
    "a point of @xmath64 is a point of @xmath65 where the matrix :    @xmath70 has rank at most @xmath71 .",
    "so the determinants of the @xmath72-minors :    @xmath73 are zero , that is : @xmath74    an analytic version of a classical theorem of bertini ( see @xcite and @xcite ) states that if @xmath75 are holomorphic functions defined on a complex analytic space @xmath76 and if @xmath77 are sufficiently generic , for @xmath78 , then the singular locus of the subvariety @xmath79 is contained in the union of the singular set of @xmath76 and the set : @xmath80    so it follows from the analytic theorem of bertini that there exists a non - empty zariski open set @xmath81 in the space of non - zero linear forms of @xmath40 to @xmath47 that take @xmath19 to @xmath21 such that for any @xmath82 one has that the singular points @xmath83 of @xmath64 are contained in the union of the set of the points where the determinants above are zero and the singular locus of @xmath51 .",
    "that is : @xmath84 since this intersection is contained in @xmath85 and @xmath64 is contained in @xmath65 , it follows that @xmath64 is smooth .",
    "now , since @xmath86 , it follows from the geometric version of the weierstrass preparation theorem given in @xcite that the restriction of @xmath50 to the germ @xmath55 is finite .",
    "in particular , a theorem of remmert ( see @xcite , page 60 , for instance ) implies that the image @xmath87 of the analytic set @xmath53 by the finite morphism @xmath50 is an analytic set of the same dimension , and hence it is a complex curve .    finally , notice that there is a finite number of indices @xmath88 such that @xmath12 is contained in @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath89 be the finite subset of @xmath90 formed by such indices .",
    "so the set : @xmath91 is the desired non - empty zariski open set in the space of non - zero linear forms of @xmath40 to @xmath47 that take @xmath19 to @xmath21 .    for any @xmath48",
    "we say that the germ of curve at @xmath12 given by : @xmath92 is the _ polar curve of @xmath11 relatively to @xmath38 at @xmath12 _ and that the germ of curve at @xmath93 given by : @xmath94 is the _ polar discriminant of @xmath11 relatively to @xmath38 at @xmath93_. in fact , @xmath95 behaves as a discriminant of the germ @xmath50 as indicated in proposition [ prop_discriminant ] below .    from now on , we fix a linear form @xmath48 and we set @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "also , from this point we will assume that @xmath11 has an isolated singularity at @xmath12 relatively to the stratification @xmath34 .",
    "now let us recall some definitions and a result that gives us an important tool to prove theorem [ theo_main ] ( see @xcite for instance ) .",

    "we say that a stratified map @xmath104 as above is a stratified submersion if each @xmath109 is a submersion .",
    "we say that a stratified map @xmath104 as above is a stratified homeomorphism if @xmath104 is a homeomorphism and each @xmath109 is a smooth diffeomorphism .",
    "let @xmath99 be an analytic space with whitney stratification @xmath101 .",
    "we say that a continuous vector field @xmath110 in @xmath99 is a stratified vector field if for each @xmath88 , the restriction @xmath111 of @xmath110 to @xmath105 is a smooth vector field .",
    "we have :    [ lemma_ve ] let @xmath99 be a complex analytic space with a whitney stratification @xmath101 , and let @xmath112 be a proper stratified submersion over an open subset @xmath30 of @xmath113 .",
    "if @xmath110 is a smooth vector field in @xmath30 , then @xmath104 lifts @xmath110 to a stratified vector field in @xmath99 that is integrable .",
    "the proof comes from the fact that , under the hypothesis of the first isotopy theorem of thom - mather ( @xcite ) , a smooth vector field lifts to a rugose vector field , and hence integrable . for this",
    ", we notice that for a complex analytic space , theorem 1.2 of chapter v of @xcite gives that the whitney conditions imply the strict whitney conditions , and then our claim follows from proposition 4.6 of @xcite .    as we said before , lemma [ lemma_ve ]",
    "will be used many times in the next sections of this paper .",
    "now let us go back to the map @xmath114 defined above .",
    "notice that it is stratified and that it induces a stratified submersion @xmath115 , where @xmath30 is an open subset of @xmath116 .    by an analytic version of corollary 2.8 of @xcite , there exist @xmath14 and @xmath117 small enough positive real numbers with @xmath118 such that , for any @xmath119 , the sphere @xmath120 around @xmath12 of radius @xmath14 intersects @xmath121 transversally , for any @xmath88",
    ".    we can also choose the linear form @xmath38 in such a way that there exists @xmath122 sufficiently small , with @xmath123 , such that @xmath124 intersect @xmath120 transversally , for any @xmath125 , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 are the closed disks in @xmath47 centered at @xmath93 and with radii @xmath122 and @xmath117 , respectively .",
    "so we have :    [ prop_discriminant ] the map @xmath128 induces a stratified submersion : @xmath129    in particular , the first isotopy theorem of thom - mather gives :    [ cor_discriminant ] the restriction @xmath130 above is a topological locally trivial fibration",
    ".    therefore the curve @xmath131 plays the role of a local topological discriminant for the stratified map @xmath132 .    for any @xmath133 in the disk @xmath127",

    "if @xmath135 , the milnor fiber @xmath136 of @xmath11 is homeomorphic to @xmath137 ( see theorem 2.3.1 of @xcite ) .",
    "so , in order to simplify notation , we reset : @xmath138 notice that with this notation , the boundary @xmath139 of @xmath0 is given by the union of @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "next we give a lemma that will be implicitly used many times in the paper :    [ lemma_strata ] let @xmath99 and @xmath100 be two analytic spaces in @xmath40 such that @xmath99 has a whitney stratification @xmath101 and such that @xmath100 is non - singular .",
    "if @xmath100 intersects each stratum @xmath105 transversally in @xmath40 , then the whitney stratification of @xmath99 induces a whitney stratification @xmath142 of @xmath143 , where @xmath144 , for each @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , the whitney stratification @xmath29 of @xmath2 induces a whitney stratification @xmath145 of @xmath0 .",
    "precisely , the strata of such whitney stratification are the following intersections , for @xmath88 :    * @xmath146 ; * @xmath147 ; * @xmath148 ; * @xmath149 .",
    "now , for any @xmath150 set @xmath151 . then @xmath132 induces a stratified map : @xmath152 by construction , the restriction of @xmath153 to each stratum of @xmath0 is a submersion onto the image of the stratum at any point out of @xmath154 .",
    "therefore it induces a locally trivial fibration over @xmath155 .",
    "that is , if we set : @xmath156 then the restriction of @xmath153 given by : @xmath157 is a stratified submersion ( see definition [ defi_svf ] ) and a locally trivial fibration , by thom - mather first isotopy theorem .    in the case that @xmath154 is empty , one has that : @xmath158 is a locally trivial topological fibration , which implies a locally trivial topological fibration @xmath159 .",
    "hence in this case the milnor fiber @xmath0 is homeomorphic to the product of @xmath160 and the general fiber of @xmath153 .",
    "so from now on we shall assume that the polar curve @xmath154 is not empty .",
    "we shall prove theorem [ theo_main ] by induction on the dimension @xmath1 of the analytic space @xmath2 .",
    "we could start by proving the theorem for @xmath161 and then proceed by induction for @xmath162 , but we choose to start with the @xmath163-dimensional case , in order to provide the reader a better intuition of the constructions .",
    "so in this section we prove our theorem when @xmath164 is a @xmath163-dimensional reduced equidimensional germ of complex analytic space and @xmath165 has an isolated singularity at @xmath93 in the stratified sense .",

    "+ for any @xmath150 fixed , we remind that : @xmath168 let @xmath169 be a point in @xmath170 and for each @xmath171 , let @xmath172 be the line segment in @xmath160 starting at @xmath169 and ending at @xmath173 .",
    "we can choose @xmath169 in such a way that any two of these line segments intersect only at @xmath169 .",

    "since the map @xmath176 is a stratified submersion , each @xmath177-simplex of @xmath7 is contained in some stratum @xmath178 of @xmath0 , so @xmath7 is adapted to the stratification @xmath34 .",
    "we say that @xmath7 is a _ vanishing polyhedron for @xmath11_.    notice that , in this @xmath163-dimensional case , the vanishing polyhedron @xmath7 contains the @xmath93-dimensional strata of the whitney stratification of @xmath0 induced by @xmath34 , which are the points of @xmath179 .",
    "in particular , @xmath180 is a smooth manifold .",
