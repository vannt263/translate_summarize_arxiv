    "recently , there is no doubt about the cosmological origin of the gamma - ray bursts ( hereafter grbs ) @xcite . then , assuming a large scale isotropy for the universe , one expects the same property for the grbs as well .",
    "another property , which is also expected to occur that grbs should appear fully randomly , i.e. if a burst is observed it does not give any information about the place of the next one .",
    "if both properties are fulfilled , then the distribution is called completely random ( for the astronomical context of spatial point processes see @xcite ) .",
    "there are several tests for checking the complete randomness of point patterns , however , these procedures do not always give information for both properties simultaneously .",
    "there are increasing evidence that all the grbs do not represent a physically homogeneous group @xcite .",
    "hence , it is worth investigating that the physically different subgroups are also different in their angular distributions . in the last years the authors provided @xcite several different tests probing the intrinsic isotropy in the angular sky - distribution of grbs collected in batse catalog @xcite . shortly summarizing the results of these studies",
    "one may conclude : a. the long subgroup ( @xmath0 ) seems to be distributed isotropically ; b. the intermediate subgroup ( @xmath1 ) is distributed anisotropically on the @xmath2% significance level ; c. for the short subgroup ( @xmath3 ) the assumption of isotropy is rejected only on the @xmath4% significance level ; d. the long and the short subclasses , respectively , are distributed differently on the @xmath5% significance level .",
    "( about the definition of subclasses see @xcite ; @xmath6 is the duration of a grb , during which time the @xmath7% of the radiated energy is received @xcite . )    independently and by different tests , @xcite confirmed the results a. , b. and c. with one essential difference : for the intermediate subclass a much higher - namely @xmath8% - significance level of anisotropy is claimed .",
    "again , the short subgroup is found to be `` suspicious '' , but only the @xmath9% significance level is reached .",
    "the long subclass seems to be distributed isotropically ( but see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found significant angular correlation on the @xmath10 scale for grbs with @xmath11 durations .",
    "@xcite reported a correlation between the locations of previously observed short bursts and the positions of galaxies in the local universe , indicating that between 10 and 25 per cent of short grbs originate at low redshifts ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "it is a reasonable requirement to continue these tests using more sophisticated procedures in order to see whether the angular distribution of grbs is completely random or has some sort of regularity .",
    "this is the subject of this article .",
    "new tests will be presented here .",
    "mainly the clarification of the short subgroup s behaviour is expected from these tests . in this paper , similarly to the previous studies , the _ intrinsic _ randomness is tested ; this means that the non - uniform sky - exposure function of batse instrument is eliminated .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ mat ]",
    "the three new tests are described .",
    "this section does not contain new results , but - because the methods are not widely familiar - this minimal survey may be useful .",
    "section [ tests ] contains the statistical tests on the data .",
    "section [ disc ] summarizes the results of the statistical tests , and section [ conc ] presents the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "the voronoi diagram - also known as dirichlet tesselation or thiessen polygons - is a fundamental structure in computational geometry and arises naturally in many different applications @xcite .",
    "generally , this diagram provides a partition of a point pattern ( `` point field '' , also `` point process '' ) according to its spatial structure , which can be used for analyzing the underlying point process .",
    "assume that there are @xmath13 points ( @xmath14 ) scattered on a sphere surface with an unit radius .",
    "one says that a point field is given on the sphere .",
    "the voronoi cell @xcite of a point is the region of the sphere surface consisting of points which are closer to this given point than to any other ones of the sphere .",
    "this cell forms a polygon on this sphere .",
    "every such cell has its area ( @xmath15 ) given in steradian , perimeter ( @xmath16 ) given by the length of boundary ( one great circle of the boundary curve is called also as `` chord '' ) , number of vertices ( @xmath17 ) given by an integer positive number , and by the inner angles ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this method is completely non - parametric , and therefore may be sensitive for various point pattern structures in the different subclasses of grbs .",
    "note that the behaviour of this tesselation method on the sphere surface is quite different from that on the infinite plane .",
    "this follows from the fact that the polygon s area will not be independent from each other , because the total surface of the sphere is fixed in @xmath19 steradian .",
    "hence , the spherical voronoi tesselation is not effected by border effects , and the voronoi diagram becomes a closed set of convex polygons .",
    "the points on sphere may be distributed completely randomly or non - randomly ; the non - random distribution may have different characters ( clustering , filaments , etc .",
    "; for the survey of these non - random behaviours see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "random and some regular patterns have distributions of one characteristic maxima ( unimodal ) but with different variances .",
    "the multimodality means different characteristic maxima indicating hierarchical ( cluster ) structure , the number of modes is determined by the number of scales in the sample .",
    "the vt method is able both to detect the non - randomness and to describe its form ( for more details see @xcite and for the astronomical context @xcite ) .",
    "peak - flux range in galactic coordinates .",
    "the peak - flux is given in dimesion photon/(@xmath20s).,width=355 ]      contrary to vt , this method considers the distances ( edges ) among the points ( vertices ) .",
    "clearly , there are @xmath21 distances among @xmath13 points .",
    "a spanning tree is a system of lines connecting all the points without any loops .",
    "the minimal spanning tree ( mst ) is a system of connecting lines , where the sum of the lengths is minimal among all the possible connections between the points @xcite . in this paper the spherical version of msf",
    "is used following the original prim s paper .",
    "the @xmath22 separate connecting lines ( edges ) together define the minimal spanning tree .",
    "the statistics of the lengths and the @xmath23 angles between the edges at the vertices can be used for testing the randomness of the point pattern .",
    "the mst is widely used in cosmology for studying the statistical properties of galaxy samples @xcite .",

    "is independent on the position .",
    "a multifractal ( mfr ) on a point process can be defined as unification of the subsets of different ( fractal ) dimensions @xcite .",
    "one usually denotes with @xmath30 the fractal dimension of the subset of points at which the local fractal dimension is in the interval of @xmath31 .",
    "the contribution of these subsets to the whole pattern is not necessarily equally weighted , practically it depends on the relative abundances of subsets . the @xmath30 functional relationship between the fractal dimension of subsets and the corresponding local fractal dimension",
    "is called the mfr or hausdorff spectrum .    in the vicinity of @xmath32-th point ( @xmath33 )",
    "one can measure from the neighbourhood structure a local dimension @xmath34 ( `` rnyi dimension '' ) .",
    "this measure approximates the dimension of the embedding subset , giving a possibility to construct the mfr spectrum which characterizes the whole pattern ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "if the maximum of this convex spectrum is equal to the euclidean dimension of the space , then in classical sense the pattern _ is not a fractal _ , but the spectrum remains sensitive to the non - randomness of the point set .    there is a wide variety of astronomical phenomena , where the concept of fractal and/or multifractal can be successfully applied @xcite .",
    ", corresponding to the completely random 2d euclidean case.,width=355 ]",
    "the three procedures outlined in section [ mat ] enable us to derive several stochastic quantities well suited for testing the non - randomness of the underlying point patterns .",
    "up to the present the most comprehensive all - sky survey of grbs was done by the batse experiment on board of the cgro satellite in the period of 1991 - 2000 . in this period",
    "the experiment collected 2704 well justified burst events and the data are available in the current batse catalog @xcite .",
    "since there are increasing evidence ( @xcite and references therein ) that the grb population is actually a mixture of astrophysically different phenomena , we divided the grbs into three groups : @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) . to avoid the problems with the changing detection threshold we omitted the grbs having a peak flux @xmath41 .",
    "this truncation was proposed by @xcite .",
    "the bursts may emerge at very different distances in the line of sight and it may happen that the stochastic structure of the angular distribution depends on it .",
    "therefore , we also made tests on the bursts with @xmath42 in the short and long population , separately .",
    "table [ test ] defines the 5 samples to be studied here .",
    ".tested samples of batse grbs . [ cols=\"<,<,<,^ \" , ]      we assigned to every mc simulated sample 13 values of the test variables and , consequently , a point in the 13d parameter space . completing 200 simulations in all of the subsamples we get in this way a 13d sample representing the joint probability distribution of the 13 test - variables . using a",
    "suitable chosen measure of distance of the points from the sample mean we can get a stochastic variable characterizing the deviation of the simulated points from the mean only by chance",
    ". an obvious choice would be the squared euclidean distance .    in case of a gaussian distribution with unit variances and without correlations",
    "this would resulted in a @xmath43 distribution of 13 degree of freedom .",
    "the test - variables in our case are correlated and have different scales .",
    "before computing squared euclidean distances we transformed the test - variables into non - correlated ones with unit variances . due to the strong correlation between some of the test - variables we may assume that the observed quantities can be represented with non - correlated variables of less in number .",
    "factor analysis ( fa ) is a suitable way to represent the correlated observed variables with non - correlated variables of less in number .",
    "since our test - variables are stochastically dependent following @xcite we attempted to represent them by fewer non - correlated hidden variables supposing that    @xmath44    in the above equation @xmath45 mean the test - variables ( @xmath46 in our case ) , the hidden variables and a noise - term , respectively .",
    "equation ( [ fac ] ) represents the basic model of fa . after making some reasonable assumptions @xcite",
    ", @xmath47 can be constrained by the following inequality :    @xmath48    which gives @xmath49 in our case .",
    "factor analysis is a common ingredient of professional statistical software packages ( bmdp , sas , s - plus , spss , etc ) .",
    "the default solution for identifying the factor model is to perform principal component analysis ( pca ) .",
    "we kept as many factors as were meaningful with respect to equation ( [ constr ] ) .",
    "taking into account the constraint imposed by equation  ( [ constr ] ) we retained 8 factors . in this way we projected the joint distribution of the test - variables in the 13d parameter space into a 8d one defined by the non - correlated @xmath50 hidden variables .",
    "the @xmath51 hidden variables in equation ( [ fac ] ) are non - correlated and have zero means and unit standard deviations . using these variables we defined",

    ", width=468 ]      in addition to the significance obtained by the binomial test in subsection [ bnom ] using the distribution of the squared euclidean distances , defined by equation ( [ eudist ] ) , one can get further information whether a batse sample represented by a point in the parameter space of the test - variables deviates only by chance or it significantly differs from the fully random distribution .    in all categories ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath37 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) we made 200 , altogether 1000 , simulations .",

    "the recent discovery of the afterglow in some short grbs indicates that these events are associated with the old stellar population @xcite accounted probably for the mergers of compact binaries , in contrast to the long bursts resulting from the collapse of very massive stellar objects in young star forming regions .",
    "the differences in progenitors reflects also the differences between the energy released by the short and long grbs .",
    "unfortunately , little can be said on the physical nature of the intermediate class . the statistical studies ( @xcite and the references therein ) suggest the existence of this subgroup - at least from the purely statistical point of view .",

    "but its physical origin is fully open yet @xcite .",
    "we made additional studies on the degree of the randomness in the angular distribution of samples selected from the batse catalog . according to the @xmath6 durations and @xmath61 peak fluxes of the grbs in the catalog we defined five groups : @xmath55 ( @xmath62 s & @xmath63 ) , @xmath56 ( @xmath62 s & @xmath64 ) , @xmath37 ( @xmath65 & @xmath64 ) , @xmath57 ( @xmath66 s & @xmath63 ) and @xmath58 ( @xmath67 s & @xmath68 ) .    to characterize the statistical properties of the point patterns , given by the samples , we defined 13 test - variables based on the voronoi tesselation ( vt ) , minimal spanning tree ( mst ) and multifractal spectra .",

    "first we supposed that the test - variables were independent and making use the binomial distribution computed the probability of obtaining significant deviation in at least one of the variables only by chance .",
