    "in recent years , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) wireless systems have received significant attention .",
    "it has been shown that mimo wireless systems have the ability to simultaneously enhance the multiplexing gain ( degrees of freedom ) and the diversity ( reliability ) of the rayleigh fading channel @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the relay channel , which was first introduced by van - der meulen in 1971 @xcite , has been reconsidered in recent years to improve the coverage , reliability , and reduce the interference in the multi - user wireless networks .",
    "the main idea is to employ some extra nodes in the network to aid the transmitter / receiver in sending / receiving the signal to / from the other end . in this way",
    ", the supplementary nodes act as ( spatially ) distributed antennas assisting the signal transmission and reception .",
    "after some recent information - theoretic results on the mimo point - to - point rayleigh fading channels @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , there has been growing interest in studying the impact of mimo systems in more complex wireless networks .",
    "some promising results have been published on mimo multiple - access and broadcast channels in @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite , and @xcite . however , there are still only a few results known concerning the mimo relay networks .",
    "moreover , no capacity - achieving strategy is known for the gaussian relay channel .",
    "this paper analyzes the performance of a parallel mimo relay network .",
    "our focus is on the amplify and forward ( af ) strategy .",
    "not only the af strategy offers low complexity and delay , but also it performs well in our setup .",
    "the classical relay channel was first introduced by van - der meulen in 1971 @xcite . in @xcite , a node defined as",
    "the relay enhances the transmission of information between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "the most important relevant results have been published by cover and el gamal @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "two different coding strategies are introduced . in the first strategy , originally named  cooperation \" , and later known as ",
    "decode - and - forward \" ( df ) , the relay decodes the transmitted message and cooperates with the transmitter to send the message in the next block . in the second strategy , known as  compress - and - forward \" ( cf ) , the relay compresses the received signal and sends it to the receiver .",
    "the performance of the df strategy is limited by the quality of the transmitter - to - relay channel , while cf s performance is mostly restricted by the quality of the relay - to - receiver channel @xcite .",
    "the drawback of using cf strategy is that it employs no cooperation between the transmitter and the relay at the receiver side .",
    "hence , the cf strategy is unable to exploit the power boosting advantage due to the coherent addition of the signal of the transmitter and the relay@xcite .",
    "more recently , several extensions of the relay channel have been considered , e.g. in @xcite .",
    "some of these extensions consider a multiple - relay scenario in which several nodes relay the message .",
    "the parallel relay channel is a special case of the multiple relay channel in which the relays transmit their data directly to the receiver . besides studying the well - known",
    " compress - and - forward \" and  decode - and - forward \" strategies , the authors in @xcite have also studied the ",
    "amplify - and - forward \" strategy where the relays simply amplify and transmit their received data to the receiver . despite its simplicity",
    ", the af strategy achieves a good performance .",
    "in fact , @xcite shows that af outperforms other strategies in many scenarios .",
    "moreover , @xcite proves that af achieves the capacity of the gaussian ( single antenna ) parallel relay network as the number of relays increases .",
    "references @xcite extend the work of @xcite to the mimo rayleigh fading parallel relay network . unlike the single antenna parallel relay scenario , in this case the af multipliers are matrices rather than scalars .",
    "hence , finding the optimum af matrices becomes challenging .",
    "reference @xcite has proposed a coherent af scheme , called  matched filtering \" , and proves that this scheme follows the capacity of the channel with a constant gap in terms of the number of relays in the asymptotic case of @xmath4 .",
    "they also show that the achievable rate of af in parallel mimo relay network grows linearly with the number of antennas ( reflecting the multiplexing gain ) and grows logarithmically in terms of the number of relays ( reflecting the distributed array gain @xcite ) .",
    "reference @xcite presents a new af scheme using the qr decomposition of the forward and backward channels in each relay that outperforms the other af schemes for practical number of relays .      in this paper",
    ", we consider the af strategy in the parallel mimo relay network .",
    "the channel is assumed to be rayleigh fading and the communication takes place in the half - duplex mode ( i.e. the relays can not transmit and receive simultaneously ) .",
    "we propose a new af protocol called  cooperative beamforming scheme \" ( cbs ) . considering the uplink channel ( from the transmitter to the relays ) as a point - to - point channel , in cbs",
    "the relays cooperatively multiply the channel matrix with its left eigenvector matrix . hence , the relays act like the spatially distributed antennas at the equivalent receiver .",
    "the interesting point is that to perform such an operation , each relay only needs to know its corresponding sub - matrix of the beamforming matrix . for the outputs to be coherently added at the receiver end , each relay has to apply zero forcing beamforming to its corresponding downlink channel ( the channel from each relay to the receiver ) . here",
    ", the interesting result is that the overall channel from the transmitter to the receiver becomes diagonal and the overall gaussian noise has independent components .",
    "we show that the proposed scheme is optimum in the case of having negligible noise in the downlink channel .",
    "however , the downlink noise would degrade the system performance when one of the relays downlink channels is ill - conditioned . to enhance the performance of cbs in general scenarios , this work introduces a variant of cbs called  incremental cooperative beamforming scheme \" ( icbs ) . in icbs ,",
    "the relays with ill - conditioned downlink channels are turned off .",
    "this strategy improves the overall point - to - point channel from the transmitter to the receiver .",
    "however , an interference term due to turning some of the relays off will be included in the equivalent point - to - point channel .",
    "it is shown that for asymptotically large number of relays , one can simultaneously mitigate the downlink noise and the interference term due to the turned - off relays . as a result",
    ", the achievable rate of icbs converges to the capacity of parallel mimo relay network with a gap which scales as @xmath5 .",
    "this result is stronger than the result of @xcite and @xcite in which they show that their scheme can asymptotically ( @xmath7 ) achieve the capacity up to @xmath8 .",
    "also , our numerical results show that the achievable rate of icbs converges rapidly to the capacity , even for moderate number of relays .",
    "our results also demonstrate that the achievable rate of icbs , the maximum achievable rate of amplify and forward strategy , the capacity of the parallel mimo relay network , and the point - to - point capacity of the uplink channel converge to each other for asymptotically large number of relays .",
    "we also show that the same result can be achieved by icbs , as long as the power of the relays scales as @xmath9 .",
    "is equivalent to @xmath10 finally , by analyzing the asymptotic snr behavior of the proposed scheme , it is proved that , unlike the matched filtering scheme of bcskei - nabar - oyman - paulraj ( bnop ) which results in a zero multiplexing gain , our proposed scheme achieves the full multiplexing gain , regardless of the number of relays .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the system model is introduced . in section iii",

    "the system model , as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , is a parallel mimo relay network with two - hop relaying and half - dulplexing between the uplink and downlink channels . in other words ,",
    "the data transmission is performed in two time slots ; in the first time slot , the signal is transmitted from the transmitter to the relays , and in the second time slot , the relays transmit data to the receiver .",
    "note that there is no direct link between the transmitter and the receiver in this model .",
    "the transmitter and the receiver are equipped with @xmath2 antennas and each of the relays is equipped with @xmath1 antennas . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume that @xmath3 .",
    "the channel between the transmitter and the relays and the channel between the relays and the receiver are assumed to be frequency flat block rayleigh fading .",
    "the channel from the transmitter to the @xmath40th relay , @xmath41 , is modeled as @xmath42 and the downlink channel is modeled as @xmath43 where the channel matrices @xmath44 and @xmath45 are i.i.d .",
    "complex gaussian matrices with zero mean and unit variance . @xmath46 and @xmath47 are additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) vectors , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the @xmath40th relay s received and transmitted signal , respectively , and @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the transmitter s and the receiver s signal , respectively . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of the sizes @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively ( figure [ fig : system ] ) .",
    "the task of amplify and forward ( af ) relaying is to find the matrix @xmath54 for each relay to be multiplied by its received signal to produce the relay s output as @xmath55 .",
    "in this way , the entire source - destination channel is modeled as @xmath56    in addition , the power constraints @xmath57\\leq{p_s}$ ] and @xmath58\\leq{p_r}$ ] must be satisfied for the transmitted signals of the transmitter and the relays , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath59 throughout the paper , except in theorem [ thm : second_uneq_power ] , where we study the case @xmath60 .",
    "the equivalent uplink channel can be represented as @xmath61^t$ ] . by applying singular value decomposition ( svd ) to @xmath62 , we have @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , the diagonal matrix @xmath64 has at most @xmath2 nonzero diagonal entries corresponding to the nonzero singular values of @xmath62 .",
    "consequently , we can rearrange the svd such that @xmath65 is of size @xmath66 while @xmath67 and @xmath64 are @xmath68 matrices .",

    "if the transmitter beamforms its data vector as @xmath79 , the end - to - end channel becomes @xmath80    equation ( [ eq : trans_rec_pro ] ) shows that the end - to - end channel is diagonal and the noise vector is white gaussian .",
    "note that the complexity of the decoder in such a channel is linear in terms of the number of transmitter s antennas , @xmath2 , and also there is no interference among different data streams .",
    "in fact , the output signals of the relays not only do not interfere with each other , but also add constructively at the receiver side .",
    "moreover , as it is shown in section iv , for @xmath81 , the achievable rate of such a scheme converges to the point - to - point capacity of the uplink channel which is shown to be an upper - bound on the capacity of the parallel relay system .",
    "the problem is that the value of @xmath73 is dominated by @xmath82}}}.\\ ] ]    this guarantees that the output power of all relays is less than or equal to @xmath83 .",
    "however , by applying ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , the value of @xmath73 could be small in the cases where the downlink channel of any of the relays is ill conditioned .",
    "this means that while the output power of the worst relay ( according to ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ) is equal to the maximum possible value , i.e. @xmath83 , there may be many relays with the output power far less than @xmath83 .",
    "this phenomenon degrades the performance , as in this case the downlink noise , @xmath84 , would be the dominant noise in ( [ eq : trans_rec_pro ] ) .",
    "as the number of relays increases , we expect ( as shown in ( [ eq : alpha ] ) ) to have smaller values of @xmath73 with high probability .",
    "in other words , there is a higher chance of having at least one ill - conditioned downlink channel among the relays . in this case",
    ", we can select a subset of relays which are in good condition and turn off the rest . in this variant of cbs , we select a subset of relays which results in a high value of @xmath73 . defining @xmath85 $ ]",
    ", we activate the relays which satisfy @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is a predefined threshold . in this manner , it is guaranteed that @xmath88 .",
    "this improvement in the value of @xmath73 is realized at the expense of turning off some of the relays , creating interference in the equivalent point - to - point channel .",
    "more precisely , by defining @xmath89 , we have ( figure [ fig : icbs ] ) @xmath90 as ( [ eq : interfer ] ) shows , by decreasing the value of @xmath87 , one can guarantee a large value of @xmath73 while increasing the gap of the equivalent channel matrix to @xmath91 .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that for large number of relays , it is possible to guarantee both having a large value of @xmath73 and a small deviation from @xmath91 .",
    "moreover , we show that by appropriately choosing the value of @xmath87 , the rate of such a scheme would be at most @xmath5 below the corresponding capacity .      in the bnop scheme , it is assumed that each relay knows its corresponding forward and backward channels , i.e. @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and at the receiver side , the effective signal power and the effective interference plus noise power are known for each antenna . however , in cbs and icbs , it is assumed that the transmitter knows the uplink channel , i.e. @xmath92 , and sends the @xmath93 matrix @xmath94 to the @xmath40th relay , @xmath95 .",
    "this assumption is reasonable when the uplink channel is slow - fading ; for example , in the case that the transmitter and all the relay nodes are fixed . furthermore ,",
    "similar to the bnop scheme , we assume that each relay knows its forward channel , i.e. @xmath45 .",
    "in addition , in cbs , it is assumed that the value of @xmath73 is set by negotiating between the relays through sending their corresponding @xmath96 to the transmitter .",
    "this assumption is not required in icbs , as the value of @xmath73 can be set as @xmath97 , where @xmath87 is a predefined threshold .",
    "finally , in both cbs and icbs , it is assumed that the receiver has the perfect knowledge about the equivalent point - to - point channel from the transmitter to the receiver .",
    "this information can be obtained through sending pilot signals by the transmitter , amplified and forwarded at the relay nodes in the same manner as the information signal . in cbs , as the equivalent point - to - point channel is diagonal , this assumption is equivalent to knowing the equivalent signal to noise ratio at each antenna .",
    "[ sec : per_anal ]    in this section , we consider the asymptotic behavior ( @xmath98 ) of the achievable rate of icbs .",
    "we show that by properly choosing the value of @xmath87 , the achievable rate of icbs converges rapidly to the capacity ( the difference approaches zero as @xmath99 ) .",
    "the sequence of proof is as follows . in lemma 1 , we relate @xmath100 $ ] ( the probability that the norm of interference term defined in equation ( [ eq : interfer ] ) exceeds a certain threshold ) to @xmath101 $ ] ( the probability of turning off a relay ) and @xmath102 $ ] ( the probability of having a sub - matrix with a large norm in the unitary matrix obtained from the svd of @xmath62 ) . in lemma 2 , we bound @xmath102 $ ] . in lemma 3 , we bound @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "as a result , in lemma 4 , we show that by properly choosing the value of @xmath87 , with high probability , one can simultaneously reduce the effect of the interference to @xmath103 and maintain a large value of @xmath73 . in lemma 5 , we show that with high probability , the minimum singular value of @xmath62 scales as @xmath104 . putting lemmas 4 and 5 together , with high probability , the ratio of the power of interference to the power of signal approaches zero . finally , in theorem 1 , we prove the main result by showing that the achievable rate of icbs converges to the capacity of the uplink channel .",
    "this is proved using the fact that the capacity of the uplink channel is an upper - bound on the capacity of parallel mimo relay network . as a consequence stated in corollary 1 ,",
    "the achievable rate of icbs , the achievable rate of the af protocol , the point - to - point capacity of the uplink channel , and the capacity of the parallel mimo relay network are asymptotically equal . as another consequence ,",
    "the difference of the rates scales as @xmath105 .",
    "using the proof of lemma 4 and theorem 1 , theorem 2 shows that as long as the power of relays behaves as @xmath106 , the same rate is achievable by icbs . finally , in theorem 3",
