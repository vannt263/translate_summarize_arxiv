    "since noise appears everywhere in our surroundings , the energy conversion from noise to controlled motion is a key to come it to use . as an energy harvester from thermal noise , the molecular sized brownian ratchet",
    "was suggested , but this machine was verified its impossibility @xcite . on the other hand , stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been suggested as a method for energy harvesting from noise @xcite .",
    "sr is a phenomena in which noise with moderate strength enhances snr ( signal noise ratio ) @xcite .",
    "sr is possibly to apply in biological sensory organs @xcite , and the applications have expanded in medical use @xcite , brain image enhancement @xcite , and nano sized transistor @xcite .    here , we discuss sr for harvesting energy from white noise and the method to enhance the energy .",
    "this letter develops a concept of power factor correction as same as electrical systems , and surveys a power allocation to active and reactive power .",
    "finally it is clarified that active power of controlled motion is maximized at sr .",
    "and phase @xmath0 as functions of @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "both @xmath6 and @xmath0 show their single peaks.,width=317 ]    suggested energy harvesters by the method of sr possess bi - stable potential @xcite .",
    "here is assumed that dynamical equation of the sr harvesters are represented altogether by the following formula : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is given as zero - mean white gaussian noise of auto - correlation function : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes oscillator mass of a harvester , @xmath11 displacement , @xmath12 damping constant , @xmath13 sinusoidal external force , @xmath14 bi - stable potential , @xmath15 bolztman constant , and @xmath16 noise temperature .",
    "@xmath17 implies time differential @xmath18 and @xmath19 ensemble average operation .",
    "we take dissipative energy of controlled motion at frequency @xmath20 as harvested energy .    without loss of generality",
    ", we can introduce the previously obtained theoretical relationship from @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are defined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xmath21 response of amplitude @xmath6 and phase @xmath0 for noise intensity @xmath1 are shown in .",
    "@xmath22 is a relaxation rate defined by @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "@xmath24 corresponds to kramers rate @xcite at @xmath25 , and potential barrier @xmath26 .",
    "according to the reaction of @xmath6 in , sr appears around @xmath27 .",
    "when sr appears , the dissipative energy becomes maximum as confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the results explain that the external force frequency @xmath20 matches the time lag to overcome the potential barrier for the harvester .    on the other hand ,",
    "when a harmonic oscillator has phase lag @xmath28 to sinusoidal external force , so called resonance appears , then dissipative energy becomes maximum .",
    "similar phenomena is also confirmed in nonlinear oscillators @xcite . in",
    ", phase lag @xmath0 becomes maximum at sr ) , and ( [ eq : phi ] ) are derived for over damped model without inertia , therefore they will not match completely . ]",
    "however , it has not been accounted for the relationship between phase lag and dissipative energy .",
    "here we focus on the relationship of phase lag @xmath0 and energy flow in system of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : srme ] ) and ( [ eq : rr ] ) . since there are two external forces ; sinusoidal force and noise , it is difficult to decide each contribution . for energy harvesting by sr ,",
    "it is necessary to see the energy flow . from",
    ", the following relationship is obtained .",
    "@xmath29 here allocates each term to input , active and reactive power . through the mechanical - electrical analogy @xcite , electrical voltage and current correspond to",
    "externally given mechanical force and the velocity of oscillator , respectively , so that the correspondence of electrical active power to mechanical dissipative power appears .",
    "at the same time , the reactive power can be explained as the mechanical energy flow . generally active and reactive",
    "power are averaged over a period .",
    "on the other hand , instantaneous input , active , and reactive power are depicted as follows : @xmath30 where the following two equations derived from the fokker - plank equation are substituted into .",
    "@xmath31 in eqs.([eq : pin ] ) , ( [ eq : pac ] ) , and ( [ eq : pre ] ) , those power are consisted of following @xmath32 : @xmath33 here we average @xmath32 over a period @xmath34 , and express them as @xmath35 .",
    "shows them as functions of noise strength @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath36 is in proportion to @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath37 and @xmath38 reach thier peak around sr .    here",
    "we discuss the physical meaning of @xmath32 .",
    "the power sources of @xmath39 and @xmath40 are obvious .",
    "@xmath39 is input power from sinusoidai force @xmath13 , because @xmath41 can be derived from .",
    "@xmath40 is input power from noise @xmath8 , because @xmath42 can be derived from eqs.([eq : srme ] ) and ( [ eq : rr ] ) .",
    "@xmath40 corresponds to dissipative power consumed by localized small scale vibration . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath43 can not be derived directly from the given forces , and the power source is not clearly defined . as you can understand , @xmath43 is a term which cancels out by adding both active ( ) and reactive powers ( ) .",
    "however , at first , @xmath43 includes frequency @xmath20 , since @xmath43 depends on potential shape @xmath44 , as in eqs.([eq : srme ] ) and ( [ eq : x ] ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath43 becomes maximum around sr as shown in .",
    "therefore @xmath43 seems a power to vibrate over the potential barrier periodically .",
    "next , energy flow is discussed based on the above power allocation .",
    "the input power @xmath40 from noise goes directly to active power and is consumed . and eqs.([eq : pin ] ) , ( [ eq : pac ] ) , ( [ eq : pre ] ) leads that , when sr appears , @xmath39 contributes to the reactive power mostly",
    ". then @xmath43 increases , since reactive power ( @xmath45 ) of has a limit .",
    "consequently active power @xmath43 including @xmath20 also increases .",
    "and @xmath43 equals to the dissipative power of controlled motion .",
    "the special feature is that , when sr appears , phase lag @xmath0 and also @xmath43 are maximized at an appropriate noise intensity .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to adjust dissipative power by altering @xmath1 similar to power factor correction in a circuit .",
