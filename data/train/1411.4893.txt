    "there is a long history of studying exactly soluble one - dimensional models in statistical physics .",
    "while sometimes these models are interesting in their own right , the main motive for their study is usually to cast some light upon behavior in higher , more physical dimensions @xmath7 , such as @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where exact solutions can not usually be found . in this paper",
    "we study a quasi - one - dimensional system of @xmath10 hard disks of diameter @xmath0 confined by impenetrable walls separated by distance @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the width of the region containing the centers of the disks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : notation ] ) .    for @xmath13 , a disk may make contact with its nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) disks , but neighboring disks can not pass each other .",
    "the ordering of the disks is still preserved : @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the position of the center of disk @xmath16 , measured along the channel , and @xmath17 is the total length available to the disk centers .",
    "the transverse coordinates of the disk centers are denoted by @xmath18 , where @xmath19 .",
    "we have in an earlier paper studied the case when @xmath20 , which permits only nearest - neighbor ( nn ) contacts  @xcite .",
    "all our results and figures for the nnn model are for @xmath21 .",
    "the numbering 1 , 2 , 3 ,  ,  @xmath10 of the disks follows the ordering of their @xmath22 coordinates . in fig .",
    "[ fig : buckled](a ) , the first disk interacts with its nearest neighbor , the second disk , but it also interacts with another disk , the third disk , giving rise to a nnn coupling . if instead we had @xmath20 , such nnn couplings would not be possible : we call this case the _ nn model_. thus , the nn and nnn models describe disks in narrow channels of different widths .    for spin glasses",
    ", nnn interactions between the spins in a one - dimensional system can introduce frustration .",
    "suppose we have spins 1 , 3 , 5 ,    in the lower of two rows of spins , and spins 2 , 4 , 6 ,   in the upper row , as shown below : @xmath23 with nnn interactions , spin 3 interacts with both of its nearest neighbors 2 and  4 , but also with its next - nearest neighbors 1 and  5 .",
    "this spin system has the same topology of interactions as will be found for some arrangements of the disks in the narrow channel system .",
    "while the spin system is effectively one dimensional , the spins in the triangles 123 and 234 could be frustrated with appropriate spin couplings .",
    "frustration is regarded as a key feature for producing glassy behavior , so perhaps it is not surprising that the presence of nnn contacts introduces features that are absent in the narrower channel which has only nn contacts .    in the nn model ,",
    "the dynamics becomes activated around a packing fraction @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "this is due to the onset of caging , a feature connected with the growth of a particular structural feature , zigzag order  @xcite .",
    "zigzag order ( see eq .   for its definition )",
    "can be regarded as a form of bond - orientational order . accompanying this activated dynamics are many of the other features which one associates with glasses , such as the appearance of a plateau in time dependent correlation functions , dynamic heterogeneities , etc .",
    "we expect there to be very similar behavior in the nnn model , but that is not the focus of this paper .",
    "instead our interest is in a feature which occurs _ only _ in the nnn model , at a packing fraction @xmath25 .",
    "( the maximum packing fraction for @xmath26 is @xmath27 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : buckled](a ) . )",
    "the phenomenology of this feature turns out to be very similar to that of the ideal glass transition  @xcite .",
    "there are standard arguments against there being any genuine phase transition in one dimension @xcite which we expect will apply to our narrow channel problem , and will rule out any genuine phase transition at finite pressure .",
    "the ideal glass transition of hard spheres in three dimensions is estimated to occur at a @xmath2 of around @xmath28  @xcite ; the analogue of the dynamical transition at @xmath29 is around  @xmath30 . in two dimensions ,",
    "activated dynamics has been observed to set in at around @xmath31 in binary @xcite and weakly polydisperse @xcite mixtures of hard disks and the ideal glass transition is estimated to occur at a packing fraction @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "it is usually believed that the dynamical transition at @xmath29 is avoided in any finite dimension and it is uncertain whether the transition found at @xmath2 in an approximate treatment , valid for dimension @xmath33 , will survive to lower dimensions .",
    "these approximate calculations involve the analogue of one - step replica symmetry breaking , which may be destroyed by fluctuation effects in any physically interesting dimension  @xcite .",
    "thus while the absence of a genuine phase transition in our channel system is not surprising , it is possible that glass transitions in two or three dimensions might also be avoided .",
    "a piece of evidence that the feature at @xmath2 might be the remnant of the ideal glass transition is from the growth of a particular correlation length , which grows to its maximum value ( around @xmath5 ) at @xmath2 and then falls .",
    "we shall explain in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] that this length , which we call the shear - penetration length @xmath34 , is the distance over which a shear displacement of the two rows of disks decreases with distance from an amorphous boundary .",
    "it is very similar in nature to the penetration length for amorphous order calculated by molecular dynamics in refs .",
    "the penetration length can be defined in equilibrium ( like our @xmath34 ) and is conceptually simpler than the point - to - set length scale @xcite , which is the length scale below which ergodicity is broken in a region of fluid with amorphous boundaries ; but both of these length scales are expected to diverge at the glass transition  @xcite . in three dimensions , the largest values found for the penetration length to date are smaller than those we can find in our system , so in this sense we have in our model better evidence for the ideal glass transition than has been found in three dimensions .",
    "the second aspect of our feature at @xmath2 which makes us identify it as an avoided ideal glass transition is that the @xmath6-relaxation time @xmath35 , which we estimate using the ideas in ref .",
    "@xcite , will appear to diverge in a vogel  fulcher manner , @xmath36 which is of the form expected for behavior near the ideal glass transition . because there is no real singularity at @xmath2 as the transition is avoided , the time scales will not truly diverge there and will in fact diverge only for @xmath37 .",
    "there is a long tradition in the theory of glasses of attributing glass behavior to the growth of particular types of structural order , such as icosahedral order in three dimensions  @xcite .",
    "recent work by cubuk et al .",
    "@xcite on the flow of jammed and glassy systems under stress has shown that regions that are susceptible to rearrangement can be discovered by machine - learning methods that combine information derived from several features of the local structure , such as the radial distribution of particles and the bond angles .",
    "since our narrow - channel system with nnn contacts is relatively simple , we are able to identify the collective motions of the disks that lead to the apparent ideal glass behaviors .",
    "thus the onset of slow dynamics near @xmath29 we can identify with the growth of bond - orientational order .",
    "the feature at @xmath2 which seems related to the ideal glass transition is connected with the growth of crystal - like order .",
    "we shall discuss this matter in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] . in the limit of very wide channels ,",
    "when a real transition can arise rather than just an avoided transition , the feature at @xmath29 becomes , we suspect , the fluid  hexatic transition , and the feature at @xmath2 evolves to be the hexatic  crystal transition .",
    "the length scale @xmath34 appears to be similar to the penetration length for amorphous order studied in the glass community . for a system of disks in a channel of any length",
    ", work must be done to displace one disk along the channel , relative to its nearest neighbors .",
    "but in a short channel with length @xmath38 , displacing one disk will cause the displacement of all of the disks of one row relative to the other row , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : buckled](c ) .",
    "this rigidity for @xmath38 is like that of an amorphous solid .",
    "another example of the utility of the nnn channel problem for the study of glasses is the work of ashwin and bowles  @xcite .",
    "they determined exactly the number @xmath39 of jammed states at packing fraction @xmath40 and calculated from it the complexity @xmath41/n$ ] .",
    "they found an apparent kink in @xmath42 at a packing fraction @xmath43 , a density which we shall call @xmath44 , above which @xmath42 decreases rapidly to zero .",
    "the jammed states which exist above this density contain increasing amounts of the buckled - crystal ordering seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : buckled](a ) .",
    "it is this feature which makes it natural to identify the kink in @xmath42 with random close packing , which for hard spheres in three dimensions occurs at a packing fraction close to @xmath45  @xcite : jammed states with @xmath46 are known to contain increasing amounts of face - centered cubic crystal ordering  @xcite .",
    "ashwin and bowles also found that using the lubachevsky ",
    "stillinger algorithm @xcite to find jammed states always led to a jammed state with a packing fraction close to @xmath47 if one started from a high enough initial density .",
    "observe that in our nnn channel system @xmath48 , @xmath25 , and @xmath49 , which are rather close to each other , compared to their corresponding values in three dimensions .",
    "these numerical values are for @xmath50 .",
    "the general formulas are @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath53^{1/2}\\ ] ] is the length of one unit cell of the buckled crystal ; @xmath54 has been estimated only for @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "notice that @xmath3 coincides with @xmath2 when @xmath55 and that the difference between them increases as @xmath56 increases .    from the results of simulations in three dimensions ,",
    "it has been noted @xcite that the rate at which distinct , disordered states disappear with increasing density has a sharp maximum at a particular density . this maximum becomes narrower for larger system sizes , perhaps becoming infinitely sharp and leading to a well - defined @xmath47 in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "kamien and liu @xcite argue that such a feature , which corresponds to a discontinuity in @xmath42 , will be accompanied by a divergence of the pressure on a metastable branch of the equation of state .",
    "they suggest that the position of this singularity may be obtained by extrapolation from the low - density portion of the equilibrium equation of state .",
    "we suspect that in our equilibrium calculation , the apparent divergence of the force @xmath57 , when extrapolated to @xmath2 , might have some connection with their argument",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the equilibrium state at @xmath2 is certainly not jammed and that a snapshot of it would show much more disorder than in fig .",

    "using such a configuration as the starting point for the lubachevsky  stillinger algorithm @xcite will always result in a slightly denser state , quite possibly one with packing fraction close to  @xmath47 .",

    "[ sec : eqofstate ] we study the equation of state and show that the pressure apparently diverges when @xmath40 is extrapolated to @xmath2 .",
    "we also obtain the local density variation across the channel .",
    "as the packing fraction increases , the disks are pushed more and more against the channel walls , but for @xmath58 some of the disks lift away from the walls in order to achieve the buckled crystalline state of fig .  [",
