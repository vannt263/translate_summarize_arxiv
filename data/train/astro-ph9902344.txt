    "recent papers ( see narayan , barret , mcclintock 1996 ; menou , quataert , narayan 1997 ; narayan , mahadevan , & quataert 1999 ; and references therein ; see also ichimarau 1977 ) considering advection dominated accretion flows ( adaf ) as a solution for many astrophysical problems should be treated with some caution , because of its uncertain physical basis .",
    "the suggestions underlying adaf include the neglect of the heating of the accretion flow due to magnetic field annihilation and the assumption of electron heating due _ only _ to binary collisions with protons ( ions ) .",
    "these issues were first pointed out by bisnovatyi - kogan and lovelace ( 1997 ; hereafter bkl ) and have subsequently been discussed further by quataert ( 1998 ) , blackman ( 1998 ) , and others .",
    "the work by quataert ( 1998 ) envisions an _ almost uniform _ magnetic field in the accretion flow which makes the theory of alfvnic turbulence of goldreich and sridhar ( 1995 ) applicable .",
    "the linear damping of short wavelength alfvn modes is then calculated to determine the relative importance of heating of electrons and ions .",
    "we believe that this picture is _ inconsistent _ , because the magnetic field is strongly non - uniform , in fact , turbulent with @xmath4 , and magnetic flux is necessarily destroyed in the flow .",
    "we have a fundamentally different picture of mhd turbulence in accretion flows ( bkl ) , sketched in figure 1 , which shows that there are many neutral layers of the magnetic field with associated current sheets where field reconnection and annihilation occurs . at these neutral layers , there is sporadic ohmic dissipation of magnetic energy .",
    "this picture is qualitatively similar to that for the chaotic magnetic field of the corona of the sun which we discuss later .",
    "competition between rapid accumulation of observational data , mainly from hubble space telescope , x - ray satellites , and the rapid development of theoretical models creates a situation where a model is sometimes disproved during the time of its publication .",
    "some adaf models give examples of this .",
    "one is connected with an explanation of the unusual spectrum of the galaxy ngc 4258 which has a nonmonotonic dependence .",
    "it was claimed that such spectrum may be explained by an adaf model ( lasota _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . however , recent observations ( herrnstein 1997 ) give new data in the x - ray from rxte ( cannizzo _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) which shows features not explained by adaf .",
    "high - resolution radio continuum observations of this object ( herrnstein _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) put severe constraints on the adaf model , indicated that it does not apply inside @xmath5 schwarzschild radii .",
    "another example is connected with an attempt to prove the existence of the event horizons of the black holes in adaf models .",
    "figure 7 of the work by menou , quataert and narayan ( 1997 ) , ( or figure 2 from narayan , garcia , and mcclintock 1997 ) was presented as a proof of the existence of the event horizon of black holes and at the same time as a triumph of the adaf model . unfortunately",
    ", the data for this figure appears to be incomplete , and a full set of observational data smears this picture ( chen _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) .",
    "radio observations of low luminosity cores of elliptical galaxies , where adaf models could explain the x - ray luminosity , put severe constraints on the models ( di matteo _",
    "the observed radio flux is much smaller than predicted by the adaf model with energy equipartition magnetic fields , and require magnetic energy density much below equipartition which is implausible .",
    "it is of course difficult to justify a physical model by astronomical observations without a firm physical basis . here",
    ", we analyze the different processes in an optically thin accretion flow at low accretion rates .",
    "of particular importance is the inclusion of the influence of a chaotic magnetic field which is likely embedded in the accreting plasma .",
    "we show that accurate account of these processes strongly restricts the applicability of adaf solutions .",
    "namely , the radiative efficiency of the accretion flows can not become less than about @xmath3 of the standard accretion disk value .",
    "this casts doubt on the attempts to connect adaf models with the existence of the event horizons of a black holes .",
    "also , it makes it unlikely that adaf models explain the low luminosity of massive black holes in nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "in  2 we discuss the basic equations and give a solution for the time - averaged magnetic field in a quasi - spherical accretion flow . in ",
    "3 we analyze the energy dissipation in accretion flows where there is equipartition between magnetic energy and flow energy . in ",
    "4 we point out the relevance of observations of magnetic energy dissipation in the solar corona to that in accretion flows",
    ". conclusions of this work are given in  5 .",
    "matter flowing into a black hole from a companion star or from the interstellar medium is likely to be magnetized . due to the more rapid increase of the magnetic energy density in comparison with kinetic energy densities ,",
    "the dynamical influence of the magnetic field becomes more and more important as the matter flows inwards .",
    "shwartsman ( 1971 ) argued that beginning even at large radii there should be approximate _ equipartition _ of magnetic and kinetic energies .",
    "of course , the main energy release in an accretion flow occurs in the region of small radii .",
    "this equipartition is usually accepted in recent adaf models of accretion ( see e.g narayan and yi 1994 ) .",
    "shwartsman ( 1971 ) considered an averaged , quasi - stationary picture of accretion of magnetized matter with local equipartition .",
    "another variant of magnetic accretion considered by bisnovatyi - kogan and sunyaev ( 1972 ) ( see also chang and ostriker 1985 ) is where equipartition and magnetic field annihilation is accompanied by formation of shock waves . a more accurate account of the heating of matter by magnetic field annihilation was done by bisnovatyi - kogan and ruzmaikin ( 1974 ) where exact nonstationary solutions for the field amplification in a spherical accretion flow were obtained .",
    "consider the general problem of magnetic field amplification in a plasma accretion flow .",
    "the flow is described by the magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations , @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the flow velocity , @xmath10 the magnetic field , @xmath11 the plasma pressure , @xmath12 the plasma conductivity , @xmath13 the dynamic viscosity ( with @xmath14 the kinematic viscosity ) , @xmath15 the current density , and @xmath16 the electric field",
    ". these equations can be combined to give the induction equation , @xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the magnetic diffusivity , and the approximation involves neglecting @xmath20 .    in equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) both the viscosity @xmath21 and the magnetic diffusivity @xmath13 have the same units and",
    "both are assumed to be due to turbulence in the accretion flow .",
    "thus , it is reasonable to express both transport coefficients using the `` alpha '' prescription of shakura ( 1972 ) and shakura and sunyaev ( 1973 ) , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the outer scale of the turbulence , and @xmath24 is the isothermal sound speed .",
    "bisnovatyi - kogan and ruzmaikin ( 1976 ) introduced @xmath25 and proposed that @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath27 and @xmath25 characterize a turbulent mhd flow in which there is a kolmogorov cascade of energy from large scales ( @xmath23 ) to much smaller scales where the actual ( microscopic ) dissipation of energy occurs .",
    "consider for the moment a simpler case , that of an axisymmetric poloidal magnetic field , @xmath28 .",
    "neglect of the toroidal magnetic field is plausible because this component of the field increases with decreasing @xmath29 much less rapidly than the poloidal field .",
    "( for a perfectly conducting plasma @xmath30 whereas @xmath31 . )",
    "for these conditions we have @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the flux function and @xmath34 is the vector potential . for quasi - spherical accretion , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the time - averaged radial flow velocity .",
    "consequently , ohm s law in ( 1 ) with @xmath37 gives @xmath38 without approximation , where @xmath39 is the adjoint laplacian operator , and @xmath40 .    as a further simplification ,",
    "consider stationary solutions of equation ( 4 ) .",
    "( figure 1 shows the instantaneous configuration . )",
    "because @xmath41 and because it is plausible to assume @xmath42 , equation ( 4 ) with @xmath43 is homogeneous in @xmath29 with solutions of the form @xmath44 where @xmath45const .",
    "we find that @xmath46 obeys the equation @xmath47 where @xmath40 , and @xmath48 .",
    "this is the equation for the gegenbauer polynomial @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a legendre polynomial .    for the limit of a highly conducting plasma , the magnetic field",
    "is frozen into the flow and @xmath53 .",
    "thus the magnetic energy - density varies as @xmath54 . on the other hand ,",
    "as noted by shwartsman ( 1971 ) , the kinetic energy - density varies as @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetic field can increase only up to the equipartition value where the magnetic and kinetic energy - densities are approximately equal .",
    "this occurs at a large distance @xmath56 and that this is maintained for smaller @xmath29 , where @xmath57 is the schwarzschild radius of the central object ( shwartsman 1971 ) .",
    "further accretion for @xmath58 is possible _ only _ if magnetic flux is destroyed by reconnection and the magnetic energy @xmath59 is dissipated . for these conditions @xmath60 so that @xmath61 . in view of equation",
    "( 5 ) , this corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "figure 2 shows the poloidal projection of the field lines for a sample case with @xmath62 .",
    "in optically thin accretion disks at low accretion rates , the density of the matter is low and energy exchange between electrons and ions due to binary collisions is slow . in this situation , due to different mechanisms of heating and cooling for electrons and ions ,",
    "the electrons and ions may have different temperatures .",
    "this was first discussed by shapiro , lightman , and eardley ( 1976 ) , but advection was not included .",
    "narayan and yi ( 1995 ) pointed out that advection in this case is extremely important .",
    "it may carry the main energy flux into a black hole , giving a low radiative efficiency of the accretion of @xmath63 to @xmath64 , the adaf solutions .",
    "the adaf solutions assume an `` alpha '' prescription for the viscosity .",
    "thus , as the ion temperature increases , the viscosity increases and the viscous dissipation also increases . if the energy losses by ions are small , then there can be a kind of `` thermo - viscous '' instability where heating increases the viscosity and the increase in viscosity increases the heating .",
    "development of this instability leads to formation of adaf . in the adaf solution",
    "the ion temperature is of the order of the virial temperature @xmath65 .",
    "this means that even for high initial angular momentum , the disk is very thick , forming a quasi - spherical accretion flow .",
    "the conclusion about low radiative efficiency of adaf is valid only when the influence of a magnetic field is neglected .",
    "the @xmath10 field is likely to be turbulent and in approximate equipartition with the flow . for such conditions",
    "there must be continuous destruction of magnetic flux by field reconnection and annihilation ( shwartsman 1971 ) .",
    "this reconnnection is expected to significantly heat electrons which can efficiently emit magneto - bremstrahlung radiation .",
    "because of the electron radiation , the radiative efficiency is _ not _ small .",
    "as mentioned , the poloidal magnetic field energy density tends to grow locally as @xmath66 with decreasing distance @xmath29 .",
    "however , as a result of equipartition @xmath67 .",
    "the difference in the radial gradients of @xmath68 and @xmath0 must therefore go into ohmic heating of the matter .",
    "this leads to the important result @xmath69 with @xmath70 the entropy per unit mass , @xmath71 measured in energy units , and @xmath72 , where the angle brackets indicate a time average over the turbulence ( bisnovatyi - kogan & ruzmaikin 1974 ) .    in quasi - spherical accretion flows ,",
    "equipartition between magnetic and kinetic energy of the flow was proposed by shwartsman ( 1971 ) , @xmath73 which corresponds to an alfvn speed @xmath74 , with @xmath75 the keplerian speed . for disk accretion , where there is more time for a field dissipation , shakura ( 1972 ) proposed equipartition between magnetic and turbulent energy . for an `` alpha '' prescription for the viscosity , where the turbulent velocity is @xmath76",
    ", this leads to the relation @xmath77 in adaf solutions , where the ion temperature is of the order of the virial temperature , the two expressions , ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) , give comparable estimates for @xmath78 if @xmath79 .",
    "note however that in the following the exact value of @xmath80 is not assumed .    for quasi - spherical accretion",
    ", the local electric field strength can be estimated as @xmath81 .",
    "the heating of the matter by ohmic dissipation is then given by @xmath82 using equations ( 3 ) and @xmath83 , we find that equation ( 11 ) is compatible with ( 8) if @xmath84 .",
    "equations for the radial variations of the ion and electron temperatures can be written as @xmath85 @xmath86 which differ from the corresponding equations of bkl by separating out the viscous and ohmic heating contributions . here , @xmath87 , which is equal to @xmath88 for stationary conditions",
    ", @xmath89 represents the bremsstrahlung cooling , and @xmath90 the cyclotron cooling including the self - absorption ( trubnikov 1958 , 1973 ) which is important ( see expressions given in bkl ) .",
    "the rate of the energy exchange between ions and electrons due to the binary collisions was obtained by landau ( 1937 ) and spitzer ( 1940 ) as @xmath91 with @xmath92 the coulomb logarithm .",
    "we may express parameters of the accretion flow as @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the rates of viscous heating of ions @xmath95 and of electrons @xmath96 can be written as @xmath97 for a single temperature plasma , the microscopic viscosity coefficient of electrons gives @xmath98 ( chapman & cowling 1953 ; braginskii 1965 ) . in the case of weakly interacting electrons and ions",
    ", @xmath99 could be significantly smaller .",
    "different viscosities for electrons and ions act to give different angular rotation rates for electrons and ions and thus act to drive a toroidal current , which is a battery effect . in turn",
    "this current acts to generate a poloidal magnetic field .",
    "however , the high inductance of the system ( @xmath100 ) has the effect of limiting this toroidal current to negligible values during the time scale of accretion of the matter ( bisnovatyi - kogan & blinnikov 1977 ) .    in equations ( 12 ) and",
    "( 13 ) the rate of ohmic heating of ions is written as @xmath101 and that of ions @xmath102 , with @xmath103 . using equations ( 8) and ( 16 ) , we find @xmath104 in  view  of   equation ( 15 ) , this   ratio   is   equal  to @xmath105 . for the equipartition relation ( 9 ) , this ratio is simply @xmath106 , which is unity except close to the inner radius of the flow .",
    "the partition of the ohmic heating between electrons and ions , measured by the quantity @xmath107 , has a critical influence on the model , assuming that @xmath108 is due only to binary collisions ( equation 14 ) and is not altered by plasma turbulence .",
    "observations of the solar corona outlined in  4 point to the importance of magnetic field reconnection events and indicate that a significant part of the magnetic field energy is dissipated by accelerating electrons .",
    "it follows from the physical picture of the magnetic field reconnection that transformation of magnetic energy into heat is connected with the time rate of change of the magnetic flux and the associated electric field in the neutral layer which accelerates particles .",
    "the electric force acting on the electrons and the protons is the same , but the accelerations are larger by a factor @xmath109 for electrons . during a short time",
    "the electrons gain much larger energy than the ions .",
    "additional particle acceleration and heating is expected at shock fronts , appearing around turbulent cells where reconnection occurs . in bkl , equations of the form of ( 12 ) and ( 13 ) were solved in the approximation of nonrelativistic electrons with the viscous and ohmic heating terms combined .",
    "using equation ( 17 ) , the total ( viscous @xmath110 ohmic ) heating of electrons and of ions is @xmath111 in the expression for cyclotron emission , self - absorption was taken into account using the analysis of trubnikov ( 1958 , 1973 ) .",
    "the results of calculations for @xmath112 show that almost all of the energy of the electrons is radiated .",
    "thus the radiative efficiency of the two - temperature , optically thin spherical accretion flow is not less than @xmath113 .",
    "note that account the affect of plasma turbulence on the energy exchange rate @xmath108 could lead to a radiative efficiency close to the value it has for optically thick , geometrically thin disks .",
    "studies of the solar corona have led to the general conclusion that the energy build up in the chaotic coronal magnetic field by slow photospheric driving is released by magnetic reconnection events or flares on a wide range of scales and energies ( benz 1997 ) .",
    "the observations support the idea of `` fast reconnection , '' not limited to a rate proportional to an inverse power of the magnetic reynolds number ( parker 1979 , 1990 ) .",
    "the data clearly show the rapid acceleration of electrons ( e.g. , hard x - ray flares , tsuneta 1996 ) and ions ( e.g. , gamma ray line events and energetic ions , reames _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) , but the detailed mechanisms of particle acceleration are not established .",
    "an essential aspect of the coronal heating is the continual input of energy to the chaotic coronal magnetic field due to motion of the photospheric plasma . as emphasized here",
    ", there is also a continual input of energy to the chaotic magnetic in a quasi - spherical accretion flow due to compression of the flow .",
    "the fact that the ratio of the plasma to magnetic pressures is small in the corona but of order unity in the accretion flow may of course affect the details of the plasma processes .    figure 3 shows a sketch of driven magnetic field reconnection .",
    "plasma flows into the neutral layer from above and below with a speed of the order of the turbulent velocity @xmath114 .",
    "magnetic flux is destroyed in this layer as required for the reasons discussed earlier .",
    "consequently , there is an electric field in the @xmath115direction @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the field well outside of the neutral layer .",
    "this is the same as the estimate of the electric field given by bkl . in the vicinity of the neutral layer ( @xmath118 )",
    "this electric field is typically much larger than the dreicer electric field for electron runaway @xmath119 ( parail & pogutse 1965 ) , and this leads to streaming motion of electrons in the @xmath115direction .",
    "note that it is much more difficult to have ion runaway because of the large gyro radii of ions ( bkl ; lesch 1991 ; romanova & lovelace 1992 ) . of course",
    ", in the almost uniform magnetic field assumed by quataert ( 1998 ) there may be no runaway of particles .",
    "the streaming of the electrons can give rise to a number of different plasma instabilities the growth of which gives an anomalous resistivity .",
    "galeev and sagdeev ( 1983 ) ( see also li _ et al . _ 1999 ) discuss the quasi - linear theory for such conditions and derive expressions for the rate of heating of electrons , @xmath120 and ions , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the wavenumber energy spectrum of the turbulence , @xmath123 is the linear growth rate of the mode with real frequency @xmath124 , @xmath125 is the number density , and @xmath126 is the electron drift velocity . if the quantity @xmath127 is assumed constant and taken out of the integral sign in ( 19 ) , then the ratio of heating of electrons to that of ions is @xmath128 this result is independent of the instability type .",
    "galeev and sagdeev ( 1983 ) point out that for most instabilities , relation ( 21 ) predicts faster heating of electrons than ions .",
    "earlier , lesch ( 1991 ) and di matteo ( 1998 ) emphasized the role of reconnection in accelerating electrons to relativisitic energies in accretion flows of agns .",
    "observational evidence for a black hole in the center of our galaxy and in the nuclei of other galaxies ( cherepashchuk 1996 ; haswell 1998 ) make it necessary to revise or generalize theoretical models of accretion flows .",
    "improvements of the models include account of advective terms and account of the influence of equipartition magnetic fields .",
    "conclusions based on adaf solutions for optically thin accretion flows at low mass accretion rates are at present open to question .",
    "this is because the adaf solutions neglect the unavoidable magnetic field annihilation which gives significant electron heating .",
    "in contrast with the adaf solutions , we show that the field annihilation leads to a radiative efficiency @xmath129 of the standard value for an optically thick , geometrically thin disk .",
    "it is possible that a full treatement of the ion - electron energy exhange due to the plasma turbulence further increases the radiative efficiency to this standard value ( see also fabian & rees 1995 ) .    some observational data which were interpreted as evidence for the existence of the adaf regime have disappeared after additional accumulation of data .",
    "the most interesting example of this sort is connected with the claim of `` proof '' of the existence of event horizons of black holes due to manifestation of the adaf regime of accretion ( narayan _ et al .",
    "analysis of a more complete set of observational data ( chen _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ) shows that the statistical effect claimed as an evidence for adaf disappears .",
    "this example shows the danger of `` proving '' a theoretical model with preliminary observational data .",
    "it is even more dangerous when the model is physically not fully consistent because then even a reliable set of the observational data can not serve as a proof of the model .",
    "the classical example from astrophysics of this kind gives the theory of the origin of the elements presented in the famous book of gamow ( 1952 ) , where the model of the hot universe was developed .",
    "in addition to the remarkable predictions of this model , the author wanted to explain the origin of heavy elements in the primordial explosion , neglecting the problems connected with the absence of stable elements with the number of baryons equal to @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "gamow found good agreement with his calculations , where the mentioned problem was neglected , and considered the observational curve as a proof of his theory of the origin of the elements .",
    "further developments have shown that his outstanding theory explains many things , except the origin of the heavy elements , which are produced as a result of stellar evolution .",
    "thus , there fundamental reasons for questioning the application adaf models to under - luminous agn , where the observed energy flux is much smaller than expected for standard accretion disk models .",
    "two possible explanations may be suggested .",
    "one is based on a more accurate estimations of the accretion mass flow into the black hole , which could be overestimated .",
    "another possibility is based on existence of jets and/or uncollimated outflows which carry away most of the accreting matter .",
    "many compact astrophysical objects thought to have accretion disks are observed to have jets or outflows , including active galaxies and quasars , old compact stars in binaries , and young stellar objects .",
    "the formation of jets and outflows is very probable under conditions where an ordered magnetic field threads a thin disk ( see reviews by bisnovatyi - kogan 1993 ; lovelace , ustyugova , & koldoba 1999 ) . to extend this interpretation , we suggest that under - luminous agns may lose the main part of their energy to the formation of jets or outflows .",
    "this suggests a search for a correlation between existence of jets or outflows and under - luminous galactic nuclei .",
