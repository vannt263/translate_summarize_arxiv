    "blazars are extragalactic radio  loud sources whose jet is pointing toward us ( for recent reviews , see e.g. bttcher 2007 ; ghisellini 2011 ; dermer 2014 ) . to be more precise",
    ", we may define blazars as the sources whose jet axis is at an angle @xmath1 with respect to the line of sight , where @xmath2 is the bulk lorentz factor .",
    "this implies that for each observed blazars , there are other @xmath3 intrinsically identical sources , but pointing in other directions .",
    "blazars are classically divided in two subclasses : flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacs .",
    "the usual divide between the two subclasses is based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the optical broad emission lines : bl lacs have ew@xmath45  ( rest frame , urry & padovani 1995 ; see ghisellini et al .",
    "2011 and sbarrato et al .",
    "2012 for an alternative definition ) .",
    "blazars are strong @xmath0ray emitters as a class . after the detection of 3c 273 by the _ cos b _ satellite ( swanenburg et al . 1978 ) , the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ discovered nearly 100 blazars ( nandikotkur et al .",
    "now , in the era of the _ fermi _ satellite , nearly 1,000 blazars ( 2lac ; ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ) have been detected in the 0.1100 gev energy range .",
    "this number is sufficiently large to start population studies ( e.g. ajello et al . 2012 ; 2014 ) , to derive the average properties of these sources , and to compare them to other radio  loud  but not necessarily so extreme  sources and to the general population of radio  quiet quasars . to this aim",
    ", we can benefit from the study of shaw et al .",
    "( 2012 ) concerning fsrqs detected by _",
    "fermi _ and systematically observed spectroscopically . to these sources , we added the few bl lacs in shaw et al .",
    "( 2013 ) that do show broad emission lines .",
    "together , they form an homogeneous sample of blazars detected in @xmath0rays . due to the uniform",
    "all sky exposure of the _ fermi_/lat instrument , these blazars form a @xmath0ray flux limited sample of blazars with broad emission lines .",
    "we first compare their optical properties with the radio  loud and the radio  quiet quasars of the compilation made by shen et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , comprising about 105,000 quasars of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "then we collect multiwavelength data for all blazars , and apply a simple one zone leptonic model to find the physical parameters of the sources . with respect to our earlier studies of blazars ,",
    "there are four important additions : i ) the knowledge , for all sources , of the luminosity of the broad emission lines ; ii ) the knowledge of the black hole mass derived through the virial method ( these two information are given in the study of shaw et al .",
    "2012 ) ; iii ) the high frequency radio data given by the _ wmap _ and _ planck _ satellite observations ; iv ) the far  ir data given by the _ wise _ satellite , that detects almost all sources . these data at low frequency allow to determine the synchrotron peak of powerful blazars much better than previously .",
    "we make use of the known broad emission line luminosity to derive the luminosity emitted by the accretion disc . by assuming a standard shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 ) disc , whose emitted spectrum depends only on the black hole mass and accretion rate ( or equivalently , on the emitted luminosity ) , we are able to infer the black hole mass for the majority of fsrqs , and compare this value with the mass derived with the virial method ( peterson & wandel 2000 ; mclure & dunlop 2004 , peterson 2014 ) .",
    "two important parameters of the model ( black hole mass and disc luminosity ) are therefore determined by the observations of the emission line luminosity and width and by disc fitting .",
    "when the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) are sufficiently sampled , ( i.e. such that the two spectral peaks of the non  thermal emission are robustly determined ) the parameters of the model well constrained , although some extra assumptions are needed to univocally specify them .",
    "since blazars are rapidly variable , and often with large amplitude , one should use simultaneous multiwavelength data , which in our case is impossible , given the very large number of sources .",
    "therefore the results of each individual source can be affected by the non  simultaneity of data . on the other hand",
    "we argue that , in a statistical sense , the derived distributions of the parameters are reliable .",
    "furthermore , consider that the accretion disc should vary with timescale longer than the non  thermal jet continuum , and with smaller amplitudes .",
    "results on the black hole mass and the accretion luminosity should therefore be valid also for individual sources .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in2 we present the samples of _ fermi_/lat detected blazars and the comparison sample of radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars . in ",
    "3 we discuss the general observational properties of the blazars of our sample in comparison with radio  loud and radio  quiet quasars ( namely the redshift and broad emission line strength distributions ) .",
    "we also describe how we derive the black hole masses using the disc fitting method , and compare our results with the ones derived through the virial method . in  4 we describe the blazar model we use to derive the physical parameters of the jet emitting region , and discuss how these parameters can be univocally determined by knowing the disc luminosity and the black hole mass , and in  5 we present the corresponding results . in  6",
    "we draw our conclusions .",
    "the results concerning the jet power and its relation to the accretion luminosity have been already discussed in ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we adopt a flat cosmology with @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we selected our sources from the fsrqs of shaw et al .",

    "[ numbers ] shows a break down of the samples .",
    "all our _ fermi_/lat fsrqs come from the sample of shaw et al .",
    "( 2012 , hereafter s12 ) .",
    "the sample includes 229 objects , present in the 1lac sample of abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , that have been spectroscopically observed by shen et al .",
    "( 2012 ; 165 sources ) or by the sdss data release 7 ( dr7 , shen et al .",
    "2011 , 64 objects ) . of these",
    ", we have studied the 191 objects with enough multiwavelength information necessary to apply our model .",
    "the s12 sample of fsrqs does not include several bright and famous blazars with historical spectroscopic classifications in the literature .",
    "shaw et al . ( 2013 , hereafter s13 ) studied a very large sample of bl lac objects present on the second _ fermi _ catalog of agn ( 2lac , ackermann et al .",
    "2011 ) . in the original 2lac sample , there are 410 bl lacs , 357 fsrqs and 28 agn of other known types , and 326 agn of unknown type .",
    "s13 themselves were able to classify some of the several  unknown type \" agns present in the 2lac catalog , increasing the number of bl lacs to 475 , and decreasing the number of the sources of unknown type to 215 . by spectroscopically observing a large number of bl lacs , and by adding bl lacs of already known redshift",
    ", they assembled a sample of 209 bl lac with the redshift spectroscopically measured .",
    "in addition , they could constrain the redshift of other 241 bl lacs ( finding a lower limit on the redshift , see s13 for details and their tab . 1 for a break down on the number of known redshift for source type ) . by visually inspecting all sed of the bl lacs with redshifts , we selected the 26 objects with a clear presence of broad emission lines .",
    "although they are classified as bl lacs according to the classical definition ( rest frame equivalent width of the emission line less than 5  ) , they should be rather considered to belong to the tail , at low accretion luminosities , of fsrqs , and for this reason we include them in our sample .",
    "shen et al . ( 2011 , heafter s11 ) studied a large number of quasars selected from the sdss ( schneider et al .",
    "2010 ) according to the following criteria : i ) the ( rest frame ) fwhm of the broad lines greater than 1,000 km s@xmath6 , and ii ) the absolute magnitude is brighter than @xmath8=22.0 the quasars selected in this way are 105,783 .",
    "we then selected the region of the sky covered by the first survey . in this region",
    "there are 89,783 quasars that have been observed , but not detected by the first ( with 1 mjy flux limit at 1.4 ghz ) . for brevity , we call these sources  radio  quiet \"",
    ". moreover , there are 9,393 radio  detected quasars .",
    "of these , there are 8,257 radio  loud sources , i.e. objects with a radio",
    " loudness @xmath9 .",
    "the radio  loudness is defined as in s11 , i.e. the ratio of the rest frame 5 ghz flux and the 2500   flux , where the 5 ghz flux is extrapolated from the observed 1.4 ghz flux ( assuming a power law slope @xmath10 ) ."
