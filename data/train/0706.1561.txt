    "the theory of pure state bipartite entanglement , a trait of quantum mechanics first discovered more than half a century ago @xcite , is by now well understood in terms of the entropic content , as first lucidly pointed out by schrdinger @xcite , of the reduced states of a given bipartite quantum system @xcite .",
    "general inseparability criteria are straightforwardly defined for pure states of composite systems in terms of the factorization of a given state as a tensor product involving the pure states of each subsystem @xcite . besides the direct quantification via the von neumann entropy of the reduced states , and the extension to mixed states via convex roof constructions @xcite , it is possible to introduce geometric quantifications of entanglement in terms of relative entropies @xcite or hilbert space distances defined according to different norms @xcite .",
    "an interesting point worth closer investigation is the nature of the possible relations between entropic and geometric measures of entanglement and , in parallel , the amount of information on the global nature of pure states of a composite quantum systems that can be gained by looking at how states transform under local operations that , by definition , do not change the content of entanglement ( local unitaries ) .",
    "in fact , besides playing a central role in quantum computation and quantum information processing , single - subsystem operations provide global informations on the state of the system .",
    "they find a natural motivation in the operational approach to the study of physical systems : looking at the response to a given action is a basic tool to investigate the nature of physical properties .    in the present work we address these questions in the case of @xmath0-dimensional and @xmath1-dimensional bipartite systems .",
    "we investigate the response of pure states to a particular class of local unitaries performed on the two - dimensional subsystem ( single - qubit unitary operations ) in the @xmath0-dimensional case , and on the three - dimensional subsystem in the @xmath1-dimensional case ( single - qutrit unitary operations ) .",
    "the specific class of single - qubit unitary operations that we consider is the one formed by all the unitary , hermitian , and traceless single - qubit transformations .",
    "the analogous class of single - qutrit unitary operations is the one formed by all the unitary exponentiations of single - qutrit transformations that are hermitian , traceless , and with non degenerate spectrum .",
    "this analysis yields that a necessary and sufficient condition for the separability of pure states is the existence of at least one element of these classes that leaves the state unchanged .",
    "in fact , this element turns out to be unique up to a parity flip . introducing the standard euclidean distance between a state and its image under a transformation",
    ", we find that in the @xmath0-dimensional case the entropy of entanglement is a monotonic function of the minimum squared distance and that the latter , both in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-dimensional cases , coincides exactly with the linear entropy ( or equivalently , in the @xmath2-dimensional case , with entanglement monotones such as the squared concurrence and the tangle ) .",
    "these results provide a geometric - operational characterization of entropic measures and entanglement quantifications that were originally formulated in terms of informational concepts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the set of single - qubit unitary operations and analyze the different transformations that they induce on the pure states of a @xmath0-dimensional bipartite quantum system .",
    "we find that pure state inseparability , or entanglement qualification , can be completely characterized according to the different ways in which pure states are transformed by single - qubit local unitaries .",
    "concerning the quantification of pure state entanglement , in section iii we show that the von neumann entropy of entanglement is a single - valued , monotonic function of the squared euclidean distance of pure states from their images , minimized over the entire set of single - qubit unitary transformations .",
    "in fact , we actually show that this minimum distance coincides exactly with the linear entropy , or equivalently the tangle , of the mixed state reductions .",
    "this geometric - operational characterization of entropic measures can be further connected to the maximization of a measure of the `` local factorizability '' , as discussed in section iv . in section",
    "v we generalize the analysis to @xmath1-dimensional systems .",
    "we again find that a necessary and sufficient condition for pure state separability is invariance of the states under the action of single - qutrit unitary operations , and that the minimum squared euclidean distance coincides with the linear entropy . we then establish and discussed the multivalued relation existing between the linear and the von neumann entropy . in section",
    "vi we summarize our findings and briefly remark on the applications of the formalism , in particular to quantum critical phenomena in spin systems , and possible further generalizations of the formalism .",

    "let us first consider the situation in which the state @xmath15 is completely factorized with respect to the bipartition @xmath3 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 . because subsystem @xmath10 is a qubit ,",

    "viceversa , if the state @xmath15 is entangled , then there is no squo that leaves the state unchanged or modified by an unobservable global phase factor . in fact , if such a squo existed , then @xmath15 would be one of its two eigenvectors corresponding to one of the two possible eigenvalues @xmath49 . hence , it could be put in the form of eq .",
    "( [ statofattorizzato ] ) , leading to a contradiction with the initial hypothesis that the state is entangled . collecting these results",

    "in this section we demonstrate that the linear entropy , or equivalently the tangle measure of bipartite entanglement , for any pure state @xmath15 of a @xmath0-dimensional system can be rigorously recast in terms of the euclidean distance in hilbert space between the state @xmath15 itself and the state obtained from @xmath15 by transforming it according to an appropriate squo .",
    "this result has in turn interesting consequences on the quantification of entanglement via observable quantities associated to squos .",
    "let us begin by briefly recalling some basic notions .",
    "let @xmath15 be any arbitrary pure state belonging to @xmath4 , and @xmath51 the reduced state of subsystem @xmath10 .",

    "( [ vonneumann ] ) is thus a simple monotonic function of the tangle ( linear entropy ) eq .",
    "( [ tangle ] ) .",
    "the latter varies in the interval @xmath65 $ ] , vanishing for separable states and reaching unity for maximally entangled states ( or equivalently , maximally mixed reductions with minimal purity @xmath66 ) .",
    "it is an entanglement monotone that plays an essential role in the theory of distributed entanglement and of its ensuing monogamy property due to the trade off between bipartite and multipartite nonlocal correlations . in a seminal paper coffman , kundu , and wootters",
    "@xcite showed that the tangle is an upper bound to the sum of all possible pairwise bipartite entanglements , when measured by the concurrences @xcite , for all states of a system of three qubits .",
    "recently , osborne and verstraete @xcite extended the result of coffman , kundu and wootters by proving that the tangle bounds from above the sum of all bipartite pairwise entanglement in the general case of systems of @xmath9 qubits : the distribution of bipartite quantum entanglement , as measured by the tangle @xmath63 ( or equivalently , by the linear entropy @xmath55 ) , satisfies a tight monogamy inequality @xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 denotes the bipartite quantum entanglement measured by the tangle across the bipartition @xmath69 . as a consequence of the schmidt decomposition , the monogamy inequality eq .",
    "( [ monogamy ] ) holds in general if the system under consideration is any bipartition @xmath70 between a qubit @xmath10 and a @xmath6-dimensional _ qudit _ @xmath11 , with @xmath8 .",
    "let us now consider the euclidean distance between the state @xmath15 and the transformed state @xmath71 obtained from @xmath15 by acting on it with a squo : @xmath72 .",

    "( [ distance ] ) in @xmath76 we can move on to recast in geometric and quantitative forms the separability criterion previously established . as we have shown , subsystem @xmath10 ( qubit @xmath10 ) is factorized from the rest of the system ( subsystem @xmath11 ) if and only if there exists a unique , preserving squo @xmath77 that leaves the global state @xmath15 unchanged : @xmath78 .",
    "thus , if subsystem @xmath10 is factorized , the distance @xmath79 vanishes . for any squo different from @xmath80 and @xmath81 the transformed state @xmath82 and @xmath83 . on the other hand , as soon as qubit @xmath10 is at least partially entangled with the rest of the system ( i.e. with at least some part of subsystem @xmath11 ) we have that any squo will always change the state @xmath15 and hence , regardless of the choice of the transformation , @xmath84 .",
    "so we have that necessary and sufficient condition for the factorizability of a state @xmath15 is that there exists a squo for which the distance between the state and its image under its action vanishes .",

    "these findings provide a geometric characterization and interpretation , in terms of single - qubit unitary transformations and euclidean distances in hilbert space , of entropy and entanglement measures such as the linear entropy , the tangle , and the von neumann entropy .    before ending this section",
    "we illustrate an alternative derivation of the above results that will be useful in the analysis of the @xmath1-dimensional case . in the minimization procedure",
    "we have taken advantage of the fact that squos may be parameterized , see eq .",
    "( [ traceless ] ) , as functions of the two real parameters @xmath92 and @xmath94 .",

    "due to the rapidly rising number of parameters with the local dimension of subsystem @xmath10 and the involved generalizations of the bloch sphere construction @xcite , we will follow the strategy of minimization outlined in the last part of section iii by keeping a fixed given expression for the single - qutrit transformation and then spanning over all orthonormal bases in the hilbert space of the qutrit .",
    "we first need to define the class of single - qutrit unitary transformations ( _ squtuos _ ) .",

    "in the present work we have discussed two different questions that in fact turn out to be related . one concerns the possibility of characterizing global entanglement properties of composite quantum systems by suitably defined local unitary transformations ( that , by definition , do not change the entanglement of a given state ) .",
    "the other regards the nature of the relationships between entropic and geometric measures of entanglement . by defining a suitable class of local unitaries , the single - qubit transformations that are simultaneously unitary , hermitian , and traceless",
    ", we have found that a simple necessary and sufficient condition for inseparability stems from the invariance properties of pure states under such transformations .",
    "this result is straightforwardly generalized to the @xmath1-dimensional case .",
    "we have then showed that single - subsystem unitary operations allow for a simple geometrical reformulation of the von neumann entropy and other known entropic measures . in particular , both in the @xmath0- and @xmath1-dimensional cases",
    ", we have demonstrated that the minimum squared euclidean distance between pure states and their images under single - subsystem unitary transformations coincides exactly with the linear entropy . in turn",
    ", this result implies that in the @xmath0-dimensional case the entropy of entanglement is a unique , single - valued , and monotonic function of the minimal euclidean distance .    besides the conceptual interest",
    ", these findings can be of use in applications , for instance in measuring and characterizing the separability properties and entanglement content of the ground state @xmath175 of generic , translationally - invariant models of interacting qubits ( two - level systems or spin @xmath176 ) or qutrits ( spin @xmath177 ) , both at and away from criticality @xcite .",
    "in particular , such a characterization can be obtained operationally by introducing an observable , the _ energy of excitation _",
    "@xmath178 above the ground state , that is associated to single - qubit or single - qutrit unitary transformations and is defined as @xcite : @xmath179 , where @xmath180 is a shorthand for the single - spin unitary operation between an arbitrarily selected spin ( subsystem @xmath10 ) and the rest of the system ( subsystem @xmath11 ) , and @xmath13 denotes the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "this excitation energy is positive defined , vanishes if and only if the ground state is factorized , and is a monotonic function of the linear entropy ( or equivalently of the tangle in the @xmath0-dimensional case ) . aside from the characterization of ground - state properties at the approach of quantum critical points from a quantum informatic standpoint @xcite , and the relations to single - site entanglement @xcite",
    ", we expect that the method of local unitary operations may be of particular importance as a general technique to ascertain the existence and the location of factorizability points , i.e values of the hamiltonian parameters for which the ground state ( and , in general , any pure state ) factorizes and becomes classical in models of interacting many - body quantum systems @xcite .    concerning the extension of the methods discussed in this work to higher - dimensional situations and to mixed states , the present strategy will certainly need to be modified and integrated by developing more sophisticated tools , including the use of multiple operations to yield properly defined distances between states and generalizations to mixed - states fidelities and metrics @xcite",
    ". however , some important simplifications occur if one restricts the analysis to the case of multimode pure gaussian states of infinite - dimensional systems , for which the framework introduced in the present work can be successfully applied with only minor modifications @xcite ."
