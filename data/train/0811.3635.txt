    "cosmological observations suggest the existence of dark matter . there is , also , by now ample evidence that the universe at late times is accelerating .",
    "do either of these facts require the introduction of new , dynamical degrees of freedom in the gravitational and matter sectors ?    in the case of dark matter , the analysis of `` bullet cluster '' objects such as 1e 0657 - 56  @xcite and macsj0025.4 - 1222  @xcite comes as conclusive evidence for the existence of new degrees of freedom independent of the visible baryonic matter . while the exact nature of these new degrees of freedom are still under debate , the simplest choice  a single , non - relativistic , dark matter fluid  is the center of the cosmological standard model .    even if we choose to account for the galactic rotation curves with a modification to gravity , it is difficult to do it without the addition of extra degrees of freedom .",
    "a consequence of the lovelock - grigore theorem  @xcite is that most local , classical , and covariant modifications to the gravitational action lead to new fields  @xcite .",
    "alternatives to dark matter that have these properties  such as teves  @xcite and stvg  @xcite  themselves have new fields as a consequence of the lovelock - grigore theorem .    today",
    ", cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ( @xmath1cdm ) satisfies all current observational constraints  @xcite .",
    "however , a number of theoretical issues  @xcite have prompted observational campaigns to search for deviations from the predicted @xmath1cdm behavior  @xcite .",
    "these observations will measure the equation - of - state parameter @xmath0 of the dark energy and search for deviations from the value @xmath2 that corresponds to a cosmological constant .",
    "should their results force us to abandon @xmath1cdm , we will face a problem for dark energy similar to that we faced for dark matter : do such observations require new dynamical degrees of freedom ? so far , the two major approaches to dark energy modeling that predict values of @xmath3 , quintessence  @xcite and @xmath4 gravity  @xcite , incorporate new dynamical degrees of freedom , which can be cast , in both cases , in the form of a single scalar field .    a number of attempts have been made for modifying general relativity in a way that generates cosmologies with @xmath3 but without introducing new dynamical fields .",
    "modified source gravity  @xcite , based on insights from the palatini formulation of the einstein equations  @xcite forces the ( einstein - frame ) scalar field to be non - dynamical by erasing the kinetic term .",
    "cuscuton cosmology  @xcite also modifies the kinetic term ; it appears to have new dynamical degrees of freedom but these are frozen out at the perturbative level .",
    "non - local  @xcite or holographic  @xcite theories may also avoid the introduction of new degrees of freedom .",
    "albeit ambitious , these attempts can face serious problems  @xcite .    in the opposite extreme , because of the lovelock - grigore theorem , the theoretical pressures on purely phenomenological models that deviate from @xmath1cdm but that do not introduce new dynamical degrees of freedom are strong . the fact that observations favoring dark energy are made on relativistic , hubble scales makes it even harder to avoid the consequence of the lovelock - grigore theorem , while remaining internally consistent . requiring general covariance from the start , for example , prevents one from even phrasing many minimal theories the way mond did on galactic scales  @xcite . in general , while many theories similar or equivalent to brans - dicke  @xcite may , in the limit of small post - newtonian corrections , appear only to modify the general relativistic equations of motion , the new scalars such theories introduce appear as truly independent degrees of freedom in the relativistic regime  for example , on scales approaching the horizon size .    approaches , however , that tie together two particular sets of observations  homogeneous expansion and linear structure formation  in a phenomenological but self - consistent fashion have also been recently explored .",
    "for example , the parametrized post - friedmann framework  @xcite makes minimal assumptions about the underlying physics , requiring only causality , metric structure , and energy - momentum conservation .",
    "the cardassian model  @xcite introduces a power - law term in the friedmann equation , which leads to accelerated expansion even in a matter dominated universe .",
    "the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is similar in spirit , and explicitly shows how a subset of modifications will introduce new degrees of freedom .",
    "although these approaches are general and simple to use in connection to observational data , they can not , by their very nature , generate predictions for other astrophysical settings  the solar system , for example , or nearby ( non - cosmological ) event horizons . as a result , they can not guarantee that dynamical degrees of freedom are not required for consistency in these other situations .",
    "we follow here a different approach intermediate to the two outlined above , which we call gravity with perturbative constraints ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite for an initial discussion of cosmology with perturbative constraints ) .",
    "in contrast to the fundamental approach , we do not propose a basic theory but rather remain largely neutral on the details of how a particular set of observations are generated .",
    "in contrast to the phenomenological approach , our models have a wide range of applicability and one can , for example , ask whether the cosmological predictions that do not add extra degrees of freedom are consistent with observations in the solar system or of compact objects .",
    "our aim is to cover as large a class as possible of modifications to gravity that do not require new degrees of freedom . within our framework ,",
    "it is possible in principle to incorporate all such modifications that are covariant , metric ( in the sense of obeying the einstein equivalence principle ) , and conserve energy - momentum .",
    "the price we will pay for such generality is that we must remain perturbatively close to general relativity . while we discuss in detail the exact conditions for perturbative validity below , we caution here that this valid- ity does _ not _ require weak fields ( as defined with reference to either the minkowski or homogenous frw metrics as the background ) .",
    "our method of generating such models is known in the literature as that of perturbative constraints  @xcite ; it is an alternative way of associating , in a physically unambiguous fashion , a general action of the gravitational field with a field equation that is of second order .",
    "developed to deal with approximate local actions derived from fundamentally non - local theories , it has a wide range of applicability and does not rely on the existence of an underlying non - locality .",
    "the method of perturbative constraints we use here allows us to retain many of the important features of the action of the gravitational field . in particular",
    ", it allows us to retain the translational symmetries that , under noether s principle , lead to energy - momentum conservation , as well as enforcing diffeomorphism invariance  the invariance of physical law under changes of coordinates .",
    "it does so without introducing new degrees of freedom , while at the same time producing behavior that differs from the general relativistic case , and allowing for a consistent set of predictions across a wide variety of spacetimes .",
    "in this paper , we specialize to the case of a flat , homogenous frw metric , @xmath5 } \\;.\\ ] ] it is important to emphasize here , however , that because we will be modifying gravity in ways that affect cosmological expansion , standard relationships between , e.g. , the energy density of various components and the rate of expansion that hold in a flat universe within general relativity will not necessarily hold here .",
    "we start with an action for the gravitational field that is a general function @xmath4 of the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "the field equation for this general theory is @xmath6 where @xmath7 . for a flat frw spacetime ,",

    ", we will consider lagrangian densities of the form @xmath14 where n and @xmath15 are free parameters and the last term in the action is considered only at the perturbative level .",
    "the case @xmath16 , @xmath17 was first discussed in ref .  @xcite",
    ".    henceforth we shall adopt geometerized units where @xmath18 .",

    "[ 00 ] is not a first - order ordinary differential equation in time , as is the standard friedmann equation . indeed , as discussed earlier , a non - linear lagrangian introduces additional degrees of freedom to the gravitational field .",
    "the key feature of gravity with perturbative constraints is a consistent way of treating these additional degrees of freedom as fixed and not allowing them to evolve independently  @xcite .    in practice , we combine eq .  [ 00 ] with the conservation law of eq .",
    "[ eq : cons ] , and obtain a single differential equation for the scale factor that we formally denote by @xmath24 solving this equation with @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26 and requiring the scale factor to be unity at the present epoch , we obtain the general relativistic solution , which we denote by @xmath27 .",

    "( [ eq : all_deg_freed ] ) , i.e. , @xmath28 this last equation is again an ordinary differential equation that is of first order in time and we solve it requiring the scale factor to be unity in the present epoch .",
    "inspection of the field equations or of the lagrangian action shows that we can expand the final solution for the scale factor in orders of the parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the unperturbed ricci scalar curvature of the universe in the present epoch . for the case with @xmath17 , we can write the solution for the scale factor in the form @xmath31\\;. \\label{eq : orders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that , although the modified friedmann equation includes only terms of order @xmath32 , its solution has higher - order terms because of the non - linearity of the differential equation .",
    "consistency requires that terms of order @xmath33 and higher are negligible and can , therefore , be dropped .",
    "when discussing our results , we will occasionally express them in terms of the contributions of matter and of the cosmological constant to the energy density of the universe , which are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , where @xmath36 .",
    "finally , in order to compare our results to the usual parametrization of the dark energy equation of state , we will also write the friedmann equation in the xcdm form  @xcite as @xmath37 and the equation for acceleration as @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the energy density of an equivalent `` dark energy '' component with an equation of state @xmath40 .",
    "note that this term includes contributions from both the cosmological constant and by the perturbative term that modifies the einstein equations .",
    "this situation corresponds to a universe with zero cosmological constant and @xmath43 .",
    "since we are interested in deviations in the matter dominated regime , we will only consider matter with @xmath44 . in this case , the @xmath19 component of the field equation and its trace become @xmath45 = \\rho_{m } \\label{eq : hubb}\\ ] ] and @xmath46 = \\rho_{m } \\;,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "when @xmath47 , the equation for the scale factor describes the familiar matter - dominated einstein cosmology , for which @xmath48 as a result @xmath49 and @xmath50= \\frac { \\rho_{m,0}}{\\left(a^{(0)}\\right)^3}\\;. \\label{rzero}\\ ] ] now to order @xmath32 eq .  ( [ eq : hubb ] ) gives @xmath51 solving for @xmath52 using eq .",
    "( [ h0zero ] ) and  ( [ rzero ] ) the contribution to order @xmath32 is @xmath53 we then perform the same expansion up to order @xmath33 .",
    "the contribution is @xmath54 as a boundary condition , we require that at the present epoch , which we denote by @xmath55 , the scale factor is unity .",
    "thus , as we evaluate @xmath56 to higher order in @xmath15 , we get corrections to the value of @xmath55 from general relativity , i.e. , @xmath57    as discussed earlier , it is practically impossible to check the convergence of our method without knowing the form of the lagrangian action to higher order in the parameter @xmath15 .",
    "we can provide , however , a necessary condition for convergence in calculating an observable quantity , by requiring that the correction to the value of this observable calculated to order @xmath33 is not larger than the correction calculated to order @xmath32 .    as an example , we calculate the value of the hubble constant at the present epoch , @xmath58 , as @xmath59 similarly we evaluate the deceleration parameter @xmath60 at the present epoch as @xmath61 requiring the correction to order @xmath33 in the expression for the hubble constant to be smaller than the correction to order @xmath32 results in the bound @xmath62 , whereas the same requirement for the deceleration parameter leads to @xmath63 .",
    "both of these constraints at the present epoch are very similar and require @xmath32 to have very small values , which can not lead to an accelerated expansion within the limits of perturbative validity .",
    "an additional problem of using a cosmology with @xmath17 and @xmath42 to account for the observations can be seen by writing the friedmann equation to order @xmath32 ( as in  @xcite ) , i.e. , @xmath64 transforming this equation in the xcdm form requires that @xmath65 clearly the matter - dominated perturbative gravity theory to order @xmath32 behaves as a dark energy fluid with @xmath66 which is inconsistent with the combined wmap and bao data  @xcite .",
    "we have found that , while the case with @xmath17 and @xmath42 may generate accelerating solutions , these solutions lie outside the range where the perturbative expansion to the action is valid .",
    "intuitively , this comes from the fact that by the time acceleration has begun , the matter density is low enough that the zeroth - order relation , @xmath69 , implies that the contribution of the additional term , @xmath70 , is too large to be treated as a small perturbation to the standard gravitational action .",
    "this is not the case , however , in a universe with a non - zero cosmological constant , as we will discuss below .    in the case of a universe with",

    "the wmap results , interpreted within general relativity , correspond to a universe with @xmath82  @xcite . keeping this value constant and moving towards positive values of @xmath83 , the predicted value of @xmath79 increases , because the perturbative term in the modified friedman equation contributes negatively to the rate of expansion of the universe , and the deceleration parameter decreases for the same reason .",
    "the opposite is true when the parameter @xmath83 becomes increasingly negative .",
    "the hatched areas in both figures show the regions of the parameter space where the corrections to each observable calculated to order @xmath33 are not negligible and hence the solution is no longer of the same order as the field equation .",

    "we have presented a formalism  gravity with perturbative constraints  that describes deviations from general relativistic predictions at cosmological scales without introducing new degrees of freedom .",
    "our formalism preserves diffeomorphism invariance , the einstein equivalence principle , and energy - momentum conservation .",
    "because it is based on modifications of the lagrangian of the gravitational field , it allows us to link a wide variety of observations  from compact objects and solar system phenomena , to non - linear clustering and linear structure formation  in order to test for the consistency of assuming no new gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "our method is quite different from the palatini formulation of 1/r gravity discussed by , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite , and expanded on as `` modified source gravity '' in ref .",
    "@xcite . since both our methods and those related to palatini formulations , however ,",
    "eliminate the extra degree of freedom associated with modifying general relativity it is worth comparing some of their features .",

    "@xcite noted first that the microscopic discreteness of matter did not strongly affect the averaged metric in general relativity : _ i.e. _ , when taking the matter field to be composed of discrete particles ( small but still larger than their schwartzschild radius ) the gravitational fields relative to the background are still small and @xmath100 can be consistently be replaced by @xmath101 plus a small , linear perturbation .",
    "this behavior was then contrasted with the palatini @xmath102 formulation , where the @xmath103 field , a function of the matter density that appears as a modification to the einstein equation , has strong variations from point to point since the behavior of @xmath103 is strongly non - linear in the range @xmath104 $ ] regardless of the length scale of the perturbation .    in the case of gravity with perturbative constraints , however , describing the behavior of the equations of motion when @xmath99 may involve increasingly higher order terms in the approximate equations of motion , and ",
    "likely for many , though perhaps not all , models where the first terms in the equations of motion are generated by @xmath105 cases discussed in this paper  eventually goes outside the radius of convergence of the series .",
    "that our theory can not in all cases make predictions for atomic - scale physics is a feature of the perturbative approach ; in contrast to palatini @xmath102 , the behavior at @xmath98 decouples from these more difficult questions and no particular atomic - scale behavior is required by us for consistency with larger scales .    in this first approach to the problem , we chose to look for modifications of the einstein - hilbert action that involve the addition of terms proportional to an inverse power of the ricci scalar curvature .",
    "we were lead to this choice by our goal to describe potential deviations at cosmological scales , without affecting significantly the behavior of gravity in the solar system .",
    "one might object that our particular choice of parametrization  a two dimensional space , ( @xmath1 , @xmath91 )  too - drastically narrows down the possible models considered . in a sense , this is a problem with any attempt to cover a space of functions with a finite number of parameters .",
    "our approach , however , follows the general direction of testing for modifications of gravity in the solar system and in other astrophysical systems by using the parametrized post - newtonian ( ppn ) framework @xcite . in a similar fashion to our work ,",
    "the ppn framework provided a way to link together different observations in various astrophysical settings in a consistent and physically rigorous way .",
    "while the ppn model itself required a certain degree of arbitrariness  the functional forms of the potentials  it turned out that the original choices of these functional forms  @xcite were sufficient to cover nearly every theory proposed in the following thirty - seven years . only in a few cases",
    "have failures of ppn been due to an overly restrictive choice of parameters ( see , _ e.g. _",
    "the usefulness of the framework we propose here will depend , of course , on its ability to capture the behavior of plausible gravitational theories that go beyond general relativity .",
