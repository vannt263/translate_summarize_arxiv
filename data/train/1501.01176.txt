    "the exact energy spectrum of a single quantum particle that is confined to move on a two - dimensional tight - binding periodic lattice under the influence of a uniform magnetic flux has been known for a long time  @xcite , where the competition between the lattice spacing and cyclotron radius gives rise to a self - similar complex pattern of sub - bands and mini - gaps .",
    "however , regardless of all efforts since the prediction of this hofstadter spectrum , there has been very recent but still limited success in observing some of its signatures in graphene - based solid - state materials with artificially - engineered superlattices under real magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "in addition , thanks to the recent realisation of artificial gauge fields in atomic systems  @xcite , there is also an increasing interest on this subject from the cold - atom community  @xcite .",
    "in particular , by engineering spatially - dependent complex tunneling amplitudes with laser - assisted tunneling and a potential energy gradient , two groups have recently reported realisation of the hofstadter - harper hamiltonian using neutral rubidium atoms that are loaded into laser - induced periodic potentials  @xcite .",
    "even though the hofstadter and hubbard hamiltonians have themselves been the subject of many works in the literature , there has been a lack of interest in the combined hofstadter - hubbard hamiltonian even at the mean - field level .",
    "for instance , while the use of momentum - space bcs formalism limits previous analysis of the attractive hofstadter - hubbard model only to vortex lattice ( vl ) configurations  @xcite , the existence of pair - density wave ( pdw ) and vl orders have been proposed in the context of a somewhat related model : an anisotropic 3d continuum fermi gas experiencing a uniform magnetic flux  @xcite . by first limiting their description to the lowest - landau - level limit and then making further assumptions about the strength of the anisotropic trap , the authors obtain an effectively a 1d hamiltonian in momentum space , and solved it using the bcs formalism .",
    "the existence and characterisation of a variety of distinct stripe - ordered many - body phases have either been overlooked or gone unnoticed until very recently  @xcite , distinguishing our work from the literature .",
    "in particular , here we use bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) theory in real space and study the mean - field ground states of the attractive single - band hofstadter - hubbard hamiltonian on a square lattice , including the effects of imbalanced chemical and vector potentials .",
    "we find that the cooperation between the vector potentials and interaction breaks the spatial symmetry of the system , leading to various stripe - ordered superfluid ( sf ) and supersolid ( ss ) phases that can be distinguished and characterized according to their coexisting pdw , charge - density ( cdw ) and spin - density ( sdw ) wave orders .",
    "we also discuss possible observation of such stripe - ordered phases by confining neutral atomic fermi gases in laser - induced optical lattices under laser - generated artificial gauge fields .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theory ] , first we introduce the physical setting of the problem and the model hamiltonian used , then review the non - interacting hofstadter hamiltonian and its well - known hofstadter spectrum , and then describe the self - consistent bdg formalism which takes fermion - fermion interactions into account within the mean - field approximation for pairing .",

    "we have recently shown that the hb spectrum plays a crucial role in determining the many - body states of the interacting system  @xcite , and our primary objective here is to extend and generalise the analysis to imbalanced gauge fields .",

    "instead , we focus mostly on the existence of striped phases in the dimer - bec limit as the main message of this manuscript , for which physical ( analytical ) insight are also given .",
    "the globally - unpolarized states are denoted by u - sf , s - sf and s - ss , and they stand , respectively , for uniform - sf , striped - sf , and striped - ss .",
    "the s - ss * state is also globally unpolarized , very much like the s - ss phase but it has an additional sign - changing striped - sdw order driven by the imbalance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",

    "when @xmath147 is sufficiently high , the physics must eventually be determined by the two - body bound states , i.e , cooper pairs become bosonic dimers , and unless @xmath148 , the dimer - dimer interaction [ @xmath149 is finite .",
    "such weakly - repulsive dimers can effectively be described by the hofstadter - bose - hubbard model , where superfluidity has recently been shown to break translation symmetry in the weakly - interacting limit  @xcite .    in the ideal - dimer limit of our model hamiltonian , the only way a tightly - bound dimer to move from a site @xmath4 to @xmath6 in the lattice is via what is known as pair - breaking mechanism , i.e , virtual ionisation of its constituents costs a penalty of @xmath117 , and this gives rise to the effective dimer hopping parameter @xmath150 .",

    "however , unlike atomic bosons where all of the degenerate states have equal weight , dimer bosons are fermion pairs and the number of ways of creating them with @xmath163 momentum depends on @xmath164 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . for instance , there are @xmath165 ways of intra - band pairing when @xmath166 and @xmath167 is even .",
    "thus , this analysis show that higher @xmath168 states contribute less and less , forming a perturbative series .",
    "it turns out that the first order ( @xmath169 ) correction is already much smaller than the zeroth order ( @xmath170 ) one , and that the @xmath171 terms are always negligible when @xmath127 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is because all of our numerical results fit quite well with @xmath172 contribution @xmath173 is uniform in space and determined by the total average filling @xmath61 with @xmath174  @xcite , @xmath175 for @xmath176 , and @xmath177 is the @xmath40 coordinate of site @xmath4 .",
    "moving towards the bcs side , the second - order correction to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fit ] ) can be shown to be @xmath178 for even @xmath157 .",
    "since this term is in- ( out - of-@xmath179- ) phase with the zeroth ( first ) order term , it tends to open throughs along the peaks arised from the first order one , suggesting that @xmath180 , i.e. , the form of @xmath181 coincides with @xmath131 under these conditions . equation  ( [ eqn : fit ] ) clearly shows that modulations of @xmath131 have a spatial period of @xmath157 lattice sites along the @xmath40 direction .",
    "it also implies that it is the cooperation between @xmath182 and @xmath117 that is responsible for the broken spatial symmetry and appearance of stripe order , and even though the stripe order gradually fades away with increasing @xmath117 , it survives even in the @xmath183 limit as long as @xmath127 is finite .",
    "thus , this analysis suggests that the existence of stripe - ordered sf and ss phases is not an artefact of the mean - field description , and they are physically expected in the dimer - bec limit of the attractive hofstadter - hubbard model , as discussed next .",
    "despite tremendous efforts over several decades , while the exact phase diagram of even the simplest hubbard model ( which does not include the gauge fields or zeeman fields ) is still the subject of a hot debate , the mean - field phases and resultant phase diagrams of the mean - field hubbard model are pretty much settled . to appreciate the effects of gauge fields ,",

    "[ fig:14 ] and  [ fig:16 ] , the p - sf regions are dominated mainly by a phase that can be characterized by almost - striped pdw and sdw orders with some additional corrugations along the stripes that is caused by @xmath250 .",

    "motivated by this exotic possibility , here we study two different limits .    as the first limit",
    ", we consider a pair of time - reversal symmetric gauge fields , i.e , @xmath252 .",

    "thanks to the time - reversal symmetry , even though the ground state is not a p - sf but an unpolarized sf at @xmath193 , it is not properly indicated in these figures for low @xmath127 .",
    "the general structures of the transition boundaries that are seen in these phase diagrams are quite similar to the ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:14 ] for the @xmath254 case .",
    "however , there is an important caveat in the dimer - bec limit : the ground state becomes a u - sf for any @xmath111 as long as @xmath130 is sufficiently low .",
    "given our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] , this is intuitively expected since the effective gauge field of cooper pairs vanish ( @xmath255 ) in the dimer - bec limit as the gauge field of @xmath29 and @xmath30 fermions precisely cancel each other .",
    "in addition , the p - sf regions necessarily shrink here , since the u - sf to p - sf transition boundaries are expected to be close to the no - gauge - field ( @xmath221 ) ones shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] .    as the second limit",
    ", we set one of the gauge fields to zero , corresponding effectively to a charged - uncharged mixture of two - component fermions .",

    "[ fig:0114](a ) .",
    "however , the imbalance between gauge fields causes p - sf in figs .",
    "[ fig:0114](b ) and  [ fig:0114](c ) even at @xmath193 .",
    "similar to the analysis given in sec .",
    "[ sec : bgf ] , the high- and low-@xmath130 limits can be directly read off from hb and effective dimer - bec descriptions , respectively , with again an important caveat in the dimer - bec limit : the ground state becomes a s - ss * for @xmath258 as long as @xmath130 is sufficiently low . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes](c ) , in addition to the coexisting striped - pdw and -cdw orders , s - ss*has an additional sign - changing striped - sdw order driven solely by @xmath251 .",
    "note also that if @xmath259 then all of the coexisting orders of s - ss * phase are periodic along the @xmath40 direction with periodicity @xmath260 since @xmath261 .",
    "it is clearly the cooperation between g , @xmath45 and @xmath46 that is responsible for the broken spatial symmetry and appearance of stripe order , causing much more prominent stripes for intermediate @xmath117 at a given @xmath10 .",
    "the stripe order is a direct result of hb : for a given @xmath68 , the spectrum consists of @xmath52-bands in the 1st magnetic brillouin zone within which each @xmath63 state is @xmath52-fold degenerate .",
    "therefore , when @xmath262 , not only intra- and inter - band pairings but also pairings with both 0 and a set of non - zero center - of - mass momenta are allowed  @xcite , leading to a non - uniform @xmath131 with spatially - periodic modulations , e.g , a pdw order  @xcite .",
    "the directions of center - of - mass momenta determine the direction of modulations , making it gauge dependent , e.g , @xmath40 direction in fig .",
    "[ fig : stripes ] .",
    "when the striped - pdw order is sufficiently large , it drives an additional striped - cdw order in the total fermion filling , giving rise to striped - ss phases .",
    "we emphasise that the instabilities towards stripe - ordered phases discussed in this paper are driven by the gauge fields , and they may formally not be identified with the fflo phase which is driven by the zeeman field and is characterized by cosine - like sign - changing @xmath131 oscillations along a spontaneously - chosen direction  @xcite .",
    "in addition , while the periods of our striped - pdw , -cdw and -sdw orders are always given by @xmath157 , the period of fflo modulations is determined by the mismatch @xmath10 between @xmath29 and @xmath30 fermi surfaces .",
    "for instance , when @xmath166 , the stripes have a spatial period of @xmath167 or @xmath263 lattice sites , depending on whether @xmath167 is odd or even .",
    "lastly , while our striped phases survive even in the extreme dimer - bec limit ( @xmath147 ) for a large parameter space , the fflo modulations survive not only in the bcs limit but also for a tiny parameter space nearby the p - sf to n transition boundary .",
    "having explored the ground states and phase diagrams of thermodynamic systems , here we study confined systems and comment on the likelihood of observing stripe - ordered phases by loading neutral atomic fermi gases on laser - induced optical lattices under laser - generated artificial gauge fields . for this purpose , we consider a harmonically - confined @xmath264 square lattice with an isotropic trapping potential @xmath265 centered at the origin , where @xmath266 is its strength and @xmath267 is the position of site @xmath4 .",
    "the local ground states of trapped systems can be reliably inferred through the so - called local - density approximation , where the local density of the system is mapped to that of a thermodynamic one with the same density .",
    "this description is known to be very accurate for large systems that are trapped in slowly - varying potentials . for our model hamiltonian , due to the energy gaps of hb and the pauli exclusion principle ,",
    "one expects the so - called wedding - cake structures in @xmath132 and @xmath133 profiles of non - interacting fermions at @xmath121 , where the number of mini - gaps determines the number of spatially - flat @xmath126 regions for a given @xmath68 .",
    "thus , wedding - cake structures consist of a number of insulating regions that are sandwiched between normal regions .",
    "however , since the majority of these mini - gaps are very small compared to @xmath268 , finite @xmath117 and/or finite @xmath110 quickly smear out the flat regions , making their detection nearly impossible . in sharp contrast , here we show that the broken spatial symmetry and stripe orders persist at intermediate and strong interactions , providing a viable knob for the experimental probe of the fractal structure of hb .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : g5 - 1401-nohs ] , we illustrate a typical self - consistent solution for a trapped system when @xmath253 , @xmath269 , @xmath270 , @xmath193 and @xmath271 .",
    "the total numbers of @xmath20 fermions are approximately given by @xmath272 .",
    "while the remnants of the so - called wedding - cake structure , i.e. , spatially - flat @xmath132 regions around integer multiples of @xmath245 fillings , are hardly recognisable , a large pdw order is clearly visible .",
    "given the phase diagrams discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : igf ] , both cdw and sdw orders are expected to be weak around half - filling , since @xmath273 near the center of the trap for this particular set of data .",

    "for instance , we show @xmath274 cuts in figs .",

    "[ fig:1414-nohs ] where @xmath276 for every @xmath4 , the imbalance between @xmath45 and @xmath46 causes small but visible sdw orders in fig .",
    "[ fig:1401-nohs ] .",
    "we note that @xmath251 may also cause a global polarisation , i.e , @xmath277 , for weak @xmath117 , however , this polarisation must gradually disappear towards the dimer - bec limit .",
    "for instance , as @xmath127 increases to @xmath278 , while @xmath279 is approximately given by @xmath280 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1414-nohs ] , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are given , respectively , by @xmath283 and @xmath284 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1401-nohs ] .",
    "these figures show that the cdw and sdw orders tend to be more prominent for intermediate @xmath117 as long as the system is away from half - filling .",
    "this is quite intuitive since the appearance of a pdw order breaks the spatial symmetry of the system at the first place .",
    "the spatial periods are , respectively , given by 2 and 4 sites in figs .",
    "[ fig:1414-nohs ] and  [ fig:1401-nohs ] , and these findings are in agreement with our analysis given in sec .",
    "[ sec : dimer ] .",
    "in addition , since the relative stripes eventually fade away towards the dimer - bec limit , the trap profiles slowly recover the usual ( no - gauge - field ) results in both figures .",
    "it is also pleasing to see that the valleys of the pdw and cdw orders and peaks of the sdw order coincide when they coexist .",
    "these results suggest that observation of pdw , cdw and sdw features as a function of magnetic flux may furnish clearest and direct evidence for the existence of multiple band structure , and hence indirectly for the fractal hb , in trapped atomic systems .",
    "since most of our phases have either coexisting cdw and/or sdw orders , our phase diagrams may not be convenient to generate more accurate phase diagrams by including the hartree terms via a simple shift in @xmath285 .",
    "however , we still neglected these shifts in our diagrams for their numerical as well as analytical simplicity .",
    "for instance , including these shifts in the self - consistency eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : bdg])-([eqn : ndo ] ) not only requires about an order of magnitude more iterations to converge , but also it complicates our current intuition making it more difficult to extract the relation between hb and the non - monotonic dependences of some of the phase boundaries .",
    "note that since hartree shifts have no role in driving the stripe - ordered phases , which is particularly clear in the dimer - bec limit where @xmath285 do not explicitly play any role in our analysis , their inclusion is expected to change some of the transition boundaries without much effect on the stability of phases .",
    "furthermore , since the mean - field theory provides only a qualitative description of the phase diagrams and the accuracy of our results can be somewhat improved by including these shifts , one still needs to go beyond this approximation for experimentally more relevant diagrams . therefore , even though hartree shifts are neglected in sec .",
    "[ sec : tpd ] , our results may already pave the way to qualitative understanding of the exact ground states of the attractive hofstadter - hubbard model .    to illustrate these points ,",
    "the hartree - shifted trap profiles are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1414-hs ] and  [ fig:1401-hs ] for the parameters of figs .",
    "[ fig:1414-nohs ] and  [ fig:1401-nohs ] , respectively . comparing these figures",
    "show that while the inclusion of the hartree shifts does not have much effect on @xmath131 for these particular sets of data ( thanks to the particle - hole symmetry around half - filling ) , it affects the total filling quite a bit .",

    "[ fig:1414-hs ] , @xmath281 and @xmath282 are given , respectively , by @xmath287 and @xmath288 in fig .",
    "[ fig:1401-hs ] .",
    "however , the visibility of the striped - pdw and -cdw orders remain largely the same in both cases . in addition",
    ", we note that the remnants of the wedding - cake structures , i.e. , spatially - flat @xmath289 regions around @xmath290 fillings , are almost recognisable in figs .",
    "[ fig:1414-hs](a ) and  [ fig:1401-hs](a ) when @xmath291 or less ( not shown ) .",

    "[ fig:1414-hs ] ( [ fig:1401-hs ] ) .",
    "thus , these insulating regions leave their traces as distinct @xmath131 dips in both figures near @xmath292 when @xmath117 is sufficiently weak .    given these numerical illustrations , it is clear that our phase diagrams already shed some light on a new stripe mechanism in the dimer - bec limit , showing that the fate of stripe - ordered sf and ss phases are not affected by the hartree terms .",
    "having discussed the effects of confinement potentials , we are ready to end the paper with a briery summary of our conclusions and an outlook .",
    "our mean - field results for the attractive single - band hofstadter - hubbard model on a square lattice are as follows . in the presence of a zeeman field @xmath10 ,",
    "in addition to the intriguing phase transition boundaries between the n / i / vac and sf phase , we found a number of distinct many - body phases which can be characterized with respect to their coexisting striped - pdw , -cdw and -sdw orders . even at @xmath193 , we reached four important conclusions .",
    "first , we numerically found an unpolarized striped - superfluid phase ( s - sf ) in a large parameter space .",
    "unlike the conventional fflo phase which is driven by @xmath10 , our s - sf is driven only by the gauge fields .",
    "second , we numerically found an unpolarized striped - supersolid phase ( s - ss ) in a large parameter space . unlike the conventional ss phase which is yet to be observed and",
    "is driven either by long - range ( e.g. , nearest - neighbor ) interactions or the presence of a second species ( e.g. , bose - fermi or bose - bose mixtures ) , our s - ss is again driven only by the gauge fields .",
    "third , we also found a locally polarized but globally unpolarized striped - ss phase ( s - ss * ) when the gauge fields are imbalanced .",
    "lastly , we provided analytical insights on the microscopic origins of these stripe - ordered phases , suggesting a new physical mechanism that gives rise to fflo - like sf and ss phases in the dimer bec limit .",
    "the importance of these results can be highlighted as follows .",
    "first , spatially - modulated sf and ss phases are both of high interest not only to the atomic physics community but also to the condensed - matter , nuclear and elementary - particle physics communities .",
    "second , the unusual appearance of the stripe order is very exotic and fundamentally important by itself , because the connection between the striped - charge order that is observed in copper - oxide materials and the formation of high - tc superconductivity has been the subject of a long debate in the literature .",
    "even though our work offers no direct relation to cuprate superconductors , understanding stripe - ordered phases in the cold - atom context may still prove to be beneficial for the high - tc community .",
    "third , the existence of stripe - ordered phases is not an artefact of our mean - field bdg description , since they are analytically motivated in the dimer - bec limit .",
    "therefore , we highly encourage further research in this direction with different lattice geometries , gauge fields , etc .",
    ", in particular the beyond mean - field ones .",

    "r. o. umucalilar for discussions .",
    "it may be important to remark here that the analysis given in sec .  [",
    "sec : dimer ] depends on the particular artificial gauge field that is simulated in a cold - atom experiment .",
    "next , we use a rotationally - invariant symmetric gauge for the vector potential , i.e , @xmath294 , and analyse the spatial structure of the order parameter @xmath131 in the dimer - bec limit , which clearly reveals this dependence .",

    "[ fig : cstripes ] for @xmath207 and @xmath295 , i.e. @xmath296 is @xmath290 and @xmath245 , respectively . since the @xmath143 symmetry of the square lattice is preserved in this gauge , the stripes are checkerboard - like in the @xmath297 plane , such that generalisation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fit ] ) to @xmath298 fits very well with all of our numerical results in the dimer - bec limit . here",

    "we again note that this analytical expression is consistent with our expectation that while the dimer - bec order parameter in principle has contributions from all degenerate momenta @xmath299 where @xmath300 are complex variational parameters , only the lowest order @xmath301 terms contribute when @xmath127 is sufficiently large .",
    "this is because dimer bosons are fermion pairs and the number of ways of creating them with @xmath302 momentum depends on @xmath303 , @xmath304 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and higher @xmath305 states contribute less and less , forming again a perturbative series .",
