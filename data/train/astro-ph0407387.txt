    "in the local universe ( @xmath8mpc ) ` normal ' galaxies with x - ray emission dominated by stellar processes have been extensively studied using data from targeted observations of selected systems ( e.g. read , ponman & strickland 1997 ; shapley , fabbiano & eskridge 2001 ; zezas et al .",
    "2003 ; fabbiano et al . 2003 ; jeltema et al .",
    "although these individual observations provide valuable information on the nature and the x - ray properties of ` normal ' galaxies they can not be used for statistical studies ( e.g. @xmath6 , luminosity function , clustering properties ) .",
    "it is only recently that ultra - deep _ chandra _ surveys reaching fluxes @xmath9 ( e.g. brandt et al .",
    "2001 ; giacconi et al . 2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "2003 ) have provided the first x - ray selected sample of ` normal ' galaxy candidates ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2003 ; norman et al .",
    "these objects although too faint to significantly contribute to the x - ray background ( xrb ) are detected in increasing numbers with decreasing flux and are likely to outnumber powerful agns below @xmath10 ( hornschemeier et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the studies above however , concentrate on ` normal ' galaxies at faint x - ray limits ( @xmath11 ) and moderate redshifts @xmath12 ( median @xmath13 ) . at brighter fluxes ( @xmath14 ) probing , on average , lower redshifts , @xmath3 ,",
    "our knowledge on these systems remains scanty .",
    "this is because ` normal ' galaxies at bright x - ray fluxes have low sky density .",
    "therefore , wide area surveys are required to compile large enough samples to explore their statistical properties ( luminosity function , surface density ; georgakakis et al .",
    "such a low-@xmath15 study is essential to interpret the x - ray ` normal ' galaxies in deeper x - ray surveys and to investigate their evolution .",
    "this is particularly important since the x - ray emission is the only observable window available that allows one to probe the evolution of the x - ray binaries and the hot gas in galaxies .",
    "this provides information on the star - formation history of the universe that is complementary to that obtained from other wavelengths ( ghosh & white 2001 ; hornschemeier et al .",
    "2002 ; georgakakis et al .",
    "2003 ; norman et al .",

    "wide areal coverage is difficult to achieve with the _ chandra _ observatory due its limited field  of  view . on the contrary , xmm-_newton _ with 4 times larger field - of - view provides an ideal platform for such a study . in this paper",
    "we exploit the capabilities and the large volume of archival data of the xmm-_newton _ to serendipitously identify ` normal ' galaxy candidates in public fields selected to overlap with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) to exploit the superb and uniform 5-band optical photometry and spectroscopy available in this area . in this paper",
    "we report the first results of this survey ( needles in the haystack survey ; nhs ) using a pilot sample covering a total area of @xmath16 in the flux range @xmath17 .",
    "this dataset is continuously expanded as more sdss fields and xmm-_newton _ archival data become available . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "in this paper we use xmm-_newton _ archival observations , with a proprietary period that expired before september 2003 , that overlap with first data release of the sdss ( dr1 ; stoughton et al .",
    "only observations that use the epic ( european photon imaging camera ; strder et al . 2001 ; turner et al .",
    "2001 ) cameras as the prime instrument operated in full frame mode were employed . for fields observed more than once with the xmm-_newton _ we use the deeper of the multiple observations .",
    "a total of 20 fields are used with galactic @xmath21 in the range @xmath22 ( mean @xmath23 ) and pn good time intervals between 2 and 67ks ( mean 18.5ks ) .",
    "these observations are complemented with 8 xmm-_newton _ pointings from the northern region of the wide area , shallow xmm-_newton_/2df survey that also overlaps with the sdss ( georgakakis et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the x - ray data reduction , source detection and flux estimation are carried out using methods described in georgakakis et al .",
    "source extraction is performed in the 0.5 - 8kev merged pn+mos images using the ewavelet task of sas with a detection threshold of @xmath24 .",
    "the extracted sources for each field were visually inspected and spurious detections clearly associated with ccd gaps , hot pixels or lying close to the edge of the field of view were removed .",
    "figure [ area ] shows the solid angle covered by our survey as a function of the 0.5 - 8kev limiting flux .    to optically identify the x - ray sources we follow the method of downes et al .",
    "( 1986 ) as described in georgakakis et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to calculate the probability , @xmath25 , a given candidate is the true identification .",
    "here we apply an upper limit in the search radius , @xmath26 and a cutoff in the probability , @xmath27 , to limit the optical identifications to those candidates that are least likely to be chance coincidences .",
    "` normal ' galaxy candidates are selected to have ( i ) extended optical light profile ( i.e. resolved ) to avoid contamination of the sample by galactic stars , ( ii ) x - ray  to  optical flux ratio @xmath28 , two orders of magnitude lower than typical agns ( for the definition of @xmath29 see georgakakis et al .",
    "the sample of ` normal ' galaxy candidates is presented in table [ tab2 ] .",
    "the archival x - ray data used here include targeted observations of nearby normal galaxies with low x - ray  to  optical flux ratio .",
    "such sources have been excluded from table [ tab2 ] .",
    "moreover , a number of ` normal ' galaxy candidates although not the prime target of the xmm-_newton _ pointing lie at the same redshift as the prime target and are therefore most likely directly associated with it ( e.g. cluster or group members ) .",
    "these sources are marked in table [ tab2 ] and are excluded from any statistical analysis .",
    "low luminosity seyferts also lie in the @xmath30 regime and may contaminate our ` normal ' galaxy sample ( lehmann et al .",
    "we explore this possibility using both the x - ray and the optical spectroscopic information available for our sources .    for sources # 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 and 15 in table [ tab2 ] we can constrain the nature of the central engine using the diagnostic diagrams proposed by veilleux & osterbrock ( 1987 ) that employ intensity line ratios that are least sensitive to dust reddening ( h@xmath31/[oiii ] 5007 , [ sii ] 6716 + 31/h@xmath32 , [ oi ] 6300/h@xmath32 and [ nii ] 6583/h@xmath32 ) .",
    "we adopt the classification scheme of ho , fillipenko & sargent ( 1997 ) and find that sources # 2 , 6 , 12 and 15 have hii type spectra while # 4 is classified as a seyfert 2 . as will be discussed below the classification of source # 4",
    "is consistent with its absorbed x - ray spectrum .    for the remaining sources in table [ tab2 ] the classification using diagnostic diagrams can not be applied because either they have absorption lines only ( # 9 , 10 , 16 , 17 ) , no spectroscopic information ( # 1 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 14 ) , or both the @xmath33 and the @xmath34 \\ , 5007\\,\\aa$ ] lines , essential for spectral classification , are absent from the optical spectrum ( # 3 , 8 , 13 ) .",
    "the latter sources have strong absorption features from a dominant evolved stellar population suggesting early and intermediate hubble types .",
    "galaxies with both absorption and emission lines have been extensively studied by dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and poggianti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the basis of the equivalent widths of the h@xmath35 ( absorption ) and @xmath36\\,3727\\aa$ ] ( emission ) lines .",
    "our sources have ew@xmath37 ( absorption ) and @xmath38 ( emission ) for the h@xmath35 and @xmath36\\,3727\\aa$ ] lines respectively . following the classification of dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) the evidence above suggests e(c)-type galaxies which are believed to be systems with constant star - formation rate over a period of time resulting in a mix of young and evolved stellar populations . for these sources",
    "however , we can not exclude the possibility of low - luminosity agn activity diluted by the evolved stellar population ( e.g. severgnini et al .",
    "2003 )    we can further constrain the nature of our ` normal ' galaxy candidates via x - ray spectral analysis using the xspec v11.2 package .",
    "we use the c - statistic technique ( cash 1979 ) specifically developed to extract information from even low signal - to - noise ratio spectra .",
    "the data are grouped to have at least one count per bin .",
    "an absorbed power - law model is fit to the data fixing the power law index to @xmath39 and leaving @xmath21 free parameter .",
    "the results are shown in table [ tab2 ] . the majority of the ` normal ' galaxy candidates have soft x - ray spectral properties suggesting obscuration consistent with the galactic @xmath21 .",
    "the only exception is source # 4 which is significantly absorbed .    the final sample of ` normal ' galaxy candidates that are not associated with the prime target of a given xmm-_newton _ pointing and not showing evidence ( e.g. x - ray or optical spectra ) for obscured agn activity comprises 11 sources , # 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 13 , 15 in table [ tab2 ] . of these 11 sources",
