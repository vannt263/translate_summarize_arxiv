    "there is a wealth of physical phenomena inherent to junctions between superconducting ( s ) and normal ( n ) matter , such as the josephson effect  @xcite , quasi - particle tunneling  @xcite and andreev reflection ( ar )  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , sn junctions are either based on composites of superconducting and normal - conducting materials , or on constrictions / thickness modulations of superconducting films .",
    "a common feature of these junctions is their fixed character , since they are static constructions that can not be modified any more once they are fabricated .",
    "however , recent works have shown that the highly inhomogeneous fields of ferromagnetic domains can be used to locally suppress superconductivity in thin s - films , resulting in the states of domain - wall superconductivity  @xcite ( dws ) or reverse - domain superconductivity  @xcite ( rds ) . in these two states ,",
    "the superconductor can be seen as a network of sn junctions , which can exhibit the same flexibility as the underlying magnetic domains . in this article",
    ", we demonstrate that tunable sn junctions can be created in a controlled way by using the highly inhomogeneous fields of ferromagnetic domains .",
    "in particular , we show that in such junctions , the interfaces between the superconducting and the normal parts are highly transparent for incident electrons , which is a consequence of creating superconducting and normal state regions inside the _ same material_.    in order to experimentally investigate sn interfaces that are induced by stray magnetic fields , a specially designed superconductor / ferromagnet ( s / f ) hybrid  @xcite system was needed , exhibiting the following two qualities : ( i ) the opportunity to specifically realize superconductivity either above the magnetic domain walls ( dws ) or above the reverse domains ( rds ) of the substrate .",
    "( ii ) transport currents had to cross effectively the interfaces between the induced superconducting and normal - state regions .",
    "the preparation of such system is challenging as several strict requirements need to be fulfilled .",
    "first of all , formation of magnetic stripe domains in the template is desirable  @xcite .",
    "alignment of a transport bridge perpendicular to such domains guarantees a bias current to cross them successively .",
    "second , the magnetic domain pattern of the template must not change significantly when subjected to external fields , required for setting up the different states ( e.g. rds ) in the s - layer .",
    "finally , the out - of plane component of the stray field above magnetic domains has to reach the upper critical field of the superconductor @xcite .",
    "thereby , realization of dws is possible down to temperatures well below @xmath0 .",

    "accounting for the above requirements , s / f hybrid systems were prepared by slicing a single crystal of barium hexaferrite ( bafe@xmath2o@xmath3 ) under a small tilt to its c - axis ( figure  [ fig : sample preparation](b ) ) , and then processing superconducting aluminium bridges of 50  nm thickness on the cut surfaces perpendicular to the c - axis ( figure  [ fig : sample preparation](d ) ) .",
    "the superconducting and ferromagnetic components were electrically isolated by 5  nm sio@xmath4 in order to prevent any proximity effect .",
    "the ferromagnetic crystal ( figure  [ fig : sample preparation](a ) ) was grown from a sodium carbonate flux , following a recipe after @xcite . when cut along the proper crystallographic axis , single crystals of bafe@xmath2o@xmath3 exhibit a one - dimensional stripe - type domain structure ( figure  [ fig : sample preparation](c ) ) with dominant in - plane magnetization and relatively small",

    "apparently , the magnetization of the ferromagnet depends almost linearly on the perpendicular applied magnetic field and saturates at @xmath9 1.7  t. from the slope @xmath10 am@xmath11t@xmath11 , one can indeed expect only minor changes of the domain structure for @xmath6 mt , since the corresponding variation of the magnetic moment is less than 7@xmath12 of the saturated magnetization ( @xmath13 am@xmath11t@xmath11 ) .",

    "as it is shown in figure  [ fig : domain width ] , the width @xmath16 of the parallel domains increases linearly for @xmath17  mt with a rate of approximately 43  nm / mt . in accordance with the very small coercivity of these ferromagnets ( see figure  [ fig : m(h ) ] ) , the observed domain walls returned to their initial positions within the experimental resolution of 1  @xmath18 m , each time @xmath8 was reduced to zero .",
    "( color online ) the increase of the width @xmath16 of a parallel domain ( the bright areas in the inserts ) in the ferromagnetic substrate as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "the shown data is the average of the results obtained for an increasing and a decreasing external magnetic field .",
    "the inserts show two examples of the position of the same domain - wall at 0  mt and 150  mt , respectively.,width=274 ]    in order to show that the prepared s / f hybrid systems are suitable for the study of stray field induced sn interfaces , figure  [ fig : rds](b ) shows the normalized resistance @xmath19 ( @xmath20 being the normal state resistance ) of two transport bridges as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "both curves were measured at 340  mk , i.e. well below the critical temperature @xmath21 k of the used aluminum ( see the insert of figure  [ fig : rds ] ) . from the corresponding atomic and magnetic force microscopical images ( afm and mfm , respectively ) of figure  [ fig : rds](a ) , it can be seen that the measured parts of the bridges lay entirely above magnetic domains of opposite magnetization .",
    "the difference in the mfm signal above the two kinds of domains indicates a non - zero out - of plane component @xmath22 of the stray magnetic field . note that @xmath23 above the wide domains results directly from a finite cutting angle @xmath1 to the c - axis of the crystal .",
    "therefore , by choosing @xmath1 , the strength of @xmath22 can be adapted to match the critical fields of the superconductor . for the present case , it was found that aluminium as a superconductor and @xmath24 are a good match . for the case of the bridge above the bright domain ( left panel of figure  [ fig : rds](a ) ) , @xmath25 drops to zero around -53  mt ( see the red curve with circles ) . in a symmetric manner , @xmath25 of the bridge above",
    "the dark domain shows a similar behavior around + 53  mt ( see the blue curve with diamonds ) .",
    "these observations prove the possibility to realize the state of rds by applying compensation fields of @xmath26  mt to the designed al / bafe@xmath2o@xmath3 hybrids .",
    "moreover , it becomes clear that in the state of rds at 340  mk , the superconducting order parameter is completely suppressed above the corresponding parallel domains ( i.e. above magnetic domains with magnetization in the same direction as @xmath14 ) .",

    "the insert shows the superconducting transition of a reference al - film on a si - substrate as a function of temperature ( critical current density @xmath28 a / m@xmath29 at 340  mk).,width=325 ]    next , a long transport bridge of @xmath30 @xmath31 was investigated , which  due to its relatively large size  had to cross several magnetic domain walls of the substrate .",
    "inspection of the sample with a magnetic force microscope revealed indeed nine domain walls underneath the bridge ( figure  [ fig : fig_1](a ) ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_2 ] displays the normalized dc - resistance of the bridge well below @xmath0 , measured as a function of bias current @xmath32 and @xmath8 .",
    "as can be expected from the above presented results , two pronounced minima in resistivity are seen around @xmath33  mt , indicating that stray fields above magnetic domains are compensated by @xmath8 .",
    "application of these compensation fields thus induces the rds state in the s / f hybrid system .",
    "furthermore , a second key feature can be seen in figure  [ fig : fig_2 ] .",
    "while beyond the compensation fields the resistance quickly rises towards its value in the normal state , parts of the bridge remain superconducting when subjected to external fields lower than the compensation fields . particularly , in the case of zero applied field , when superconductivity is likewise suppressed above domains of opposite magnetization , the reduced resistance is a clear fingerprint of dws .",
    "moreover , the insert in figure  [ fig : fig_2 ] shows the transitions of the bridge from the normal state to the states of dws and rds ( at 0  mt and 53  mt , respectively ) as a function of temperature . the significant difference @xmath34 of the onsets of the transitions reflects the confinement of the superconducting order parameter above wide magnetic domains ( rds ) and narrow domain - walls ( dws ) @xcite .",

    "the insert shows the resistive transitions ( @xmath32=10 @xmath18a ) from the normal state to the states of dws ( blue curve with diamonds ) and rds ( red curve with circles ) .",
    "the points corresponding to @xmath37=340  mk are indicated in the main panel.,width=325 ]    above , the occurrence of the minima in figure  [ fig : fig_2](a ) has been discussed , along with the reduction of resistance at zero applied field .",
    "however , surprising are the values of the resistance reached at these points : as can be seen from figure  [ fig : fig_1](a ) , approximately half of the area of the bridge is covered by each kind of domains .",
    "nucleation of superconductivity above one type of domains should thus cause the bridge to loose roughly half of its resistance in the normal state .",
    "by contrast , for compensation fields of both polarities , only half of the expected resistance is seen .",
    "a similar observation can be made at @xmath38 when superconductivity survives above domain walls only . in that case , the drop in resistance is , a priori , expected to be equal to the ratio between the width of magnetic domains and domain walls .",
    "but from detailed mfm studies it becomes clear that all changes in stray fields are confined to approximately 1 @xmath39 around domain walls ( figure  [ fig : fig_1](b ) ) , whereas the domains are typically 25 @xmath39 wide ( figure  [ fig : fig_1](a ) ) .",
    "therefore , in absence of external fields , the observed reduction of resistance by @xmath40% is surprising .    in order to investigate these remarkable features in more detail ,",
    "the differential resistance @xmath41 of the transport bridge was measured as a function of bias current and temperature in both states , rds and dws .",
    "simultaneously , the voltage drop @xmath42 over the bridge was also detected .",
    "measurements were carried out via standard lock - in techniques at a frequency of 33 hz and an ac - modulation current of 2 @xmath18a .",
    "the normalized differential conductance @xmath43 is shown in figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] as a function of voltage for @xmath44 mt ( rds ) .",
    "in that diagram , results are shown twice for clarity : the left 2d - panel displays a few conductance curves that are vertically shifted , whereas all obtained curves are given in a 3d - representation at the right . here , at lowest temperatures",
    ", @xmath45 is sharply peaked at zero voltage , declining symmetrically to its minima at @xmath46 before recovering to its normal value at higher voltages .",
    "together with some smaller local minima , these features gradually collapse with increasing temperature .",
    "in order to interpret the conductance spectra of figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] , several aspects must be taken into account :    \\(i ) the whole transport bridge is in the normal state for @xmath472  mv even at the lowest temperature ( 340  mk ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the critical current density @xmath48 is exceeded due to the low resistance of the bridge .",
    "therefore , in a certain low - voltage region where @xmath49 , a higher value for @xmath45 is expected , since the parts of the bridge above reverse - domains ( rd ) are superconducting .",
    "\\(ii ) the normalized differential conductance reaches 2.8 at 340  mk and zero voltage . assuming that this increase of @xmath50 was solely caused by the n  @xmath51  s transition mentioned under point ( i )",
    ", approximately 64% of the transport bridge had to become superconducting .",
    "however , the hybrid system behaves similar for both polarities of @xmath52 ( see figure  [ fig : fig_2 ] ) , meaning that an unequal distribution of parallel and reverse domains can not be the reason for the high conductances observed at positive _ and _ negative compensation fields .",
    "moreover , as discussed above , the external field increases the width of the parallel domains by 43  nm / mt ( see figure  [ fig : domain width ] ) .",
    "accordingly , at 53  mt , a normalized conductance of only 1.8 instead of 2 should be expected , provided that parallel and reverse domains are equally distributed at @xmath53 . finally , the characteristic length @xmath54 , over which the cooper pair amplitude decays exponentially with the distance from an sn interface , is in the present case of the order of 400  nm .",
    "m@xmath29/s , with the fermi velocity @xmath55 m / s @xcite and the electron mean free path @xmath56 nm ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 are electronic mass and charge , @xmath59 m@xmath60 is the density of conduction electrons @xcite ) .",
    "the residual resistance @xmath61 was estimated according to @xmath62 , with the resistivity @xmath63 @xmath64 m of al at 295 k @xcite . ] due to this proximity effect , the superconducting state extends into the normal regions and vice versa , but the corresponding increase of @xmath45 at @xmath65 is only minor .",
    "( color online ) differential conductance spectra of the transport bridge of figure  [ fig : fig_1](a ) at 53 mt in the state of rds .",
    "arrows mark two minima whose positions can be traced . in the left panel ,",
    "curves are shifted for clarity and the vertical scale corresponds to the top curve.,width=325 ]    taking account of the above considerations , the observed conductance of 2.8 can not be explained by a corresponding expansion of the superconducting state along the transport bridge .",
    "below the superconducting gap @xmath66 ( i.e. for @xmath67 ) , an excess of the conductance can generally result from andreev reflection processes at sn - interfaces , if the latter are highly transparent for incident electrons . in the present case ,",
    "normal and superconducting states are created _ inside the same material _ and , therefore , the presence of higly transparent sn - interfaces is reasonable .",
    "accordingly , the observed excess of conductance suggests that the mechanism of charge transfer across the sn - interfaces is affected by ar .    the theory of blonder , tinkham and klapwijk ( btk )",
    "@xcite describes the effects of ar on the conductance of a single sn junction for the particular case of ballistic transport in the normal - state region .",
    "from that theory it follows that inside the gap , the conductance can be enhanced up to twice its above - gap value . in the present case , as discussed above , the above - gap conductance in the rds - state at 53  mt can be estimated to be 1.8 . therefore , the observed zero - voltage conductance of 2.8 is smaller than twice the above - gap conductance ( @xmath68 ) , meaning that these findings are not in contradiction with the btk - theory .",
    "moreover , the btk - theory predicts for highly transparent interfaces a flat conductance below the gap , which has been verified experimentally with superconducting point contacts ( see for example @xcite ) . by contrast , the @xmath50-curves of figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] are sharply peaked at zero voltage .",
    "such anomalies in the conductance spectra in the form of zero - bias peaks have been reported before in systems that deviate from the model of btk , such as for example planar nb / au contacts  @xcite , junctions between superconductors and semiconductors  @xcite and series of sns - junctions  @xcite . in the present case , the used sample differs also significantly from the model system of btk , since the bridge crosses nine domain walls ( see figure  [ fig : fig_1](a ) ) , each of them inducing one sn interface . moreover , due to the large size of the domains , the electric transport in the normal - state regions is not ballistic .",
    "a theoretical description of such series of diffusive sns junctions will go beyond the ballistic theories  @xcite , and will have to include nonlocal coherent effects in the normal - state regions @xcite .",
    "( iii )     the positions of characteristic minima in the conductance spectra of figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] and [ fig : fig_5 ] ( markers ) are compared with @xmath69 ( solid lines ) . for clarity , the results obtained at 0 mt are shifted by -0.2  .,width=325 ]    two of the local minima of the conductance spectra of figure  [ fig : fig_3 ] , marked as @xmath70 and @xmath71 , can be traced from 340  mk to nearly @xmath0 .",
    "their relative position on the @xmath42-axis was compared to the superconducting gap function @xmath72 of the bcs - theory  @xcite , using a value of 423 k for the ratio between cut - off frequency @xmath73 and boltzmann constant @xmath74  @xcite .",
    "a solution @xmath69 of the above equation can be found by iteration , integrating numerically over energies @xmath75 while treating @xmath0 as a fitting parameter .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fig_4 ] ( upper curve ) , @xmath76 follow strictly the superconducting gap @xmath66 in temperature .    for the ideal case of a single ballistic sns junction , it is known that multiple andreev reflection ( mar ) leads to minima in the conductance curves at voltages smaller than the gap ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "their positions follow @xmath69 in the same way as @xmath76",
    ". however , the present case is quite different in that the measured @xmath77-curves belong to a series of diffusive sns junctions . when dividing @xmath42 by the number of sn interfaces  @xcite and considering that @xmath42 dropped mainly over the normal - state regions of the bridge , it could be concluded that @xmath76 lay inside the gap and originate from mar ( typical values for @xmath78 are 200 @xmath18v for al  @xcite ) .",
    "however , it is also possible that series of ar processes lead to multiplication effects and to different effective voltages across subsequent sn interfaces .",
    "therefore , even if caused by the same process , features in @xmath77 could repeatedly appear at different voltages , and result in the observed set of local minima . moreover ,",
    "a multiplication effect in series of junctions might also lead to an increase of the conduction by factors higher than two  @xcite .",

    "local minima are less pronounced , but nonetheless , two of them can be traced up to higher temperatures ( lower curve in figure  [ fig : fig_4 ] ) . as before ,",
    "their positions in the conductance spectra follow the collapse of @xmath66 .",
    "it is remarkable that values of @xmath0 obtained by fitting are significantly different in the cases of rds ( @xmath79  k ) and dws ( @xmath80  k ) .",
    "these findings reflect directly that due to quantum size effects , @xmath0 values of superconducting micro - structures differ significantly from those of bulk superconductors  @xcite  an effect that leads to the reduction of @xmath0 when superconductivity is confined above the domain walls of a underlying ferromagnet  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , there are two major findings of this work : on one hand , it has been demonstrated that tunable sn junctions inside superconducting thin films can be created _ in a controlled manner _ by using magnetic templates .",
    "this first conclusion is a direct result from the successful fabrication of a s / f hybrid system , that allows for setting up dws and rds in the s - layer , without changing the actual configuration of magnetic domains . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence of andreev reflection , observed in the conductance of the s - layer of the hybrid system , proves the high transparency of sn interfaces induced by magnetic stray fields .",
    "this result is based on the innovative approach to create sn junctions _ in the same material _ via local suppression of superconductivity .    from a technological point of view",
    ", generation of sn junctions via ferromagnets is attractive due to both , the natural tunability of magnetic domain structures and the here demonstrated high quality of sn interfaces .",
    "potentially , inclusion of magnetic templates with pure in - plane magnetization will make it possible to invert the scheme of dws and to _ suppress _ superconductivity in a very narrow region above domain walls , realizing the domain - wall normal state ( dwn ) .",
