    "the strongly correlated electron system reveals a plenty of non - trivial properties which beyond the single - particle picture . the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe )",
    "@xcite is a paradigm of strongly correlated system that occurs in two - dimensional electron gas with a perpendicular magnetic field .",
    "the fqh state is one of the mostly studied object in the condensed matter physics which has topological protected ground state and non - trivial excitation .",
    "especially , the fqh states on the second landau level , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 , are expected to have non - abelian excitations and have potential applications in topological quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "quasiparticle tunneling through narrow constrictions or point contacts that bring counter - propagating edges close could serve as a powerful tool for probing both the bulk topological order and the edge properties of fractional quantum hall liquids .",
    "in particular , interference signatures from double point contact devices may reveal the statistical properties of the quasiparticles that tunnel through them  @xcite , especially the non - abelian ones  @xcite . in disk geometry",
    ", a quasiparticle can tunnel from the center to the edge by a single particle tunneling potential @xmath5 which breaks the rotational symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the ring shape of the landau basis wave function with angular momentum @xmath6 on disk , i.e. , @xmath7 has radius @xmath8 . therefore the tunneling distance @xmath9 is tuned by inserting @xmath10 flux quantum , or @xmath10 quasiholes at the center , namely @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the number of orbitals .",
    "the shape of the system evolves from disk to annulus and finally to a quasi-1d ring as increasing @xmath10 . in the ring limit ( or cft limit ) with @xmath13 , or @xmath14 , we found a universal analytical formula for the tunneling amplitudes of the bulk quasihole  @xcite and the edge excitations  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the quasihole tunneling amplitudes were found to have a scaling behavior as a function of the system size @xmath15 and the tunneling distance @xmath9 .",
    "interestingly , the fractional charge and the scaling dimension appears in the exponents of the scaling function  @xcite .",
    "however , if we look carefully at the data of the tunneling amplitude in disk geometry , the scaling function works not very well for small @xmath9 which was treated as a finite size effect  @xcite due to a limited number of electrons can be handled in the numerical diagonalization .",
    "it is also hard to look into this region on disk since @xmath14 while @xmath13 .    in this paper",
    ", we alternatively consider the physics properties of the fqh liquid in the cylinder geometry .",
    "the cylinder has advantages that the distance between the two ends is proportional to the system size and can be tuned from zero to infinity smoothly by varying the aspect ratio @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the circumference on the side with periodic boundary and @xmath18 is the length of finite cylinder with open boundaries . as a comparison , in the disk geometry",
    ", the tunneling distance has a maximum which is the radius of the system @xmath19 and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "this is very inconvenient when we want to look at the small @xmath9 region since numerous of quasiholes , or flux will be inserted at the center of disk . on the other side ,",
    "when @xmath22 , namely in the thin cylinder limit , two adjacent landau orbitals have practically zero overlap . in this case , the hamiltonian is dominated by the electrostatic repulsion which contains the direct interaction @xmath23 and the exchange interaction @xmath24 . the ground state is generally called a charge density wave ( cdw ) state , or tao - thouless ( tt ) crystal state  @xcite on torus with the electronic occupation pattern @xmath25 in order to minimize the electrostatic repulsion energy . the wave function of the fqh state  @xcite can be obtained by diagonalizing the model hamiltonian with hard - core interaction , or the hamiltonian only with @xmath26 in the language of the haldane s pseudopotential .",
    "the more interesting case is when @xmath27 or @xmath28 , to keep the total area of the surface @xmath29 invariant , or keep the total penetrated flux invariant , @xmath18 then approaches to zero .",
    "it means the two counter propagating edges at the two ends of cylinder are coming close to each other and the system finally evolves into a one - dimensional system . in this case , because of the strongly overlap of all the landau orbitals , the gaussian factors of each landau wavefunction are the same and can be erased by normalization . in this one - dimensional limit",
    ", the fqh wave function can be described by the jack polynomials and therefore all the results are the same as that we did on disk in the ring limit .",
    "the jack polynomial is one of the polynomial solutions for calogero - sutherland hamiltonian  @xcite which can describe the read - rezayi @xmath30-parafermion states with a negative parameter @xmath31 and a root configuration ( or partition ) .",
    "jack polynomial is a powerful method in studying the fqhe as it can construct not only the model wave function for read - rezayi series  @xcite , but also the low - lying excitations  @xcite .",
    "another advantage for cylinder geometry is the computational convenient comparing with either the disk or sphere geometries which was discussed in the density matrix renormalization calculation  @xcite . in this paper , we reconsider the quasiparticle tunneling with cylinder geometry especially in the region of small tunneling distance . here",
    "the quasiparticle can tunnel from the one edge to another as sketched in fig .",
    "thus the tunneling distance equals to the length @xmath18 of the system .",
    "we find a richer structure in this region and two characteristic length scales appears not only on the quasiparticle tunneling , but also in the wavefunction overlap , bipartite entanglement entropy and electron green s function .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we consider the tunneling amplitude with varying the length of the finite cylinder for @xmath32 and @xmath33 quasiholes in laughlin state . in section iii , the bipartite entanglement entropy , both in orbital space and real space",

    "for electrons on a cylinder with circumference @xmath17 in @xmath34 direction in a magnetic field perpendicular to the surface , the single electron wave function in the lowest landau level is : @xmath35 in which @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the transitional momentum along @xmath34 direction . here",

    "it can also be obtained by using the jacks with the so called root configuration `` @xmath25 '' .",
    "the quasihole state for @xmath32 and @xmath33 is just the translated states with one and two sites along @xmath40 direction respectively .",
    "or we can say a quasihole is inserted at the left edge of the finite cylinder which is represented as roots `` @xmath44 '' and `` @xmath45 '' for @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively in the jack polynomial description .",
    "a simple single particle tunneling potential @xmath46 is assumed .",
    "it describes a tunneling path along the @xmath40 direction and therefore breaks the translational symmetry in @xmath34 direction .",
    "then the matrix element is @xmath47 , which is related to the tunneling of an electron from the single particle state @xmath48 to state @xmath49 , is ( set @xmath50 ) @xmath51    it is clearly that @xmath52 where @xmath9 is the distance between the two gaussians .",
    "the many - body tunneling operator can be written as the summation of ones for single particle @xmath53 .",
    "then we can calculate the tunneling amplitude for many - body wave function @xmath54 in which the @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the ground state and quasihole state wave function respectively . in this section ,",
    "we just consider the tunneling amplitudes for @xmath32 and @xmath33 quasiholes in laughlin state at @xmath43 .",
    "the matrix elements consist of contributions from the respective slater - determinant components @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
