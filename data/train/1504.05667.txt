    "there is a large number of problems that are well known to be hardly tractable with standard computational approaches and resources , mainly due to the many - body nature of strongly correlated many particle systems . to overcome this limitation ,",
    "the idea of a quantum simulator was originally proposed by feynman @xcite : any arbitrary complex quantum systems could in fact be simulated by another quantum system mimicking its dynamical evolution , but under the experimenter control .",
    "this idea was later refined and mathematically formalized in quantum information perspectives by lloyd @xcite . + over the past twenty years",
    ", different approaches have been proposed to realize quantum simulators of the most relevant models in condensed matter physics , quantum field theories , and quantum chemistry @xcite .",
    "most efficient protocols have been proposed and experimentally realized with trapped ions @xcite . generally speaking ,",
    "quantum simulators can be broadly classified into two main categories : in _ digital simulators _ the state of the target system is encoded in qubits and its trotter - decomposed time evolution is implemented by a sequence of elementary quantum gates @xcite , whereas in _ analog simulators _ a certain quantum system directly emulates another one .",
    "digital architectures are usually able to simulate broad classes of hamiltonians , whereas analog ones are restricted to specific target hamiltonians . for a recent review on these different approaches ,",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "+ lately , superconducting circuits and resonators have emerged as an extremely promising platform for quantum information and quantum simulation architectures @xcite .",
    "the first and unique proposal for a general - purpose digital simulator has been put forward only very recently @xcite . in this proposal qubits encoded in transmons are dispersively coupled through a photon mode of a single resonator , and such coupling is externally tuned by controlling the transmon energies . however",
    ", the reported fidelities and the intrinsic serial nature of this setup ( i.e. , the need of addressing each pair of qubits sequentially ) , may hinder the scalability to a sizeable number of qubits .",
    "in addition , superconducting units are not ideal for encoding qubits owing to their relatively short coherence times . indeed ,",
    "spin - ensembles @xcite or even photons @xcite have been proposed as memories to temporarily store the state of superconducting computational qubits .",
    "+ here we consider an array of superconducting resonators as the main technological platform , on which hybrid spin - photon qubits are defined by introducing strongly coupled spin ensembles ( ses ) in each resonator @xcite . one- and",
    "two - qubit quantum gates can be implemented by individually and independently tuning the resonators modes through external magnetic fields .",
    "this setup can realize a universal digital quantum simulator , whose scalability to an arbitrary large array is naturally fulfilled by the inherent definition of the single qubits , represented by each coupled se - resonator device .",
    "the possibility to perform a large number of two - qubit gates in parallel makes the manipulation of such large arrays much faster than in a serial implementation , thus making the simulation of complex target hamiltonians possible in practice .",
    "a key novelty of the present proposal is that ensembles of effective @xmath0 spins are used in the hybrid encoding , which allows to exploit the mobility of photons across different resonators to perform two - qubit gates between physically distant qubits .",
    "this is done much more efficiently than by the straightforward approach of moving the states of the two qubits close to each other by sequences of swap gates , and makes the class of hamiltonians which can be realistically addressed much larger .",
    "long - distance operations arise whenever mapping the target system of the simulation onto the register implies two - body terms between distant qubits . besides the obvious case of hamiltonians with long - range interactions , this occurs with any two - dimensional model mapped onto a linear register , or with models containing @xmath1-body terms , including the many - spin terms which implement the antisymmetric nature of fermion wavefunctions .",
    "+ the time evolution of a generic hamiltonian is decomposed into a sequence of local unitary operators , which can be implemented by means of elementary single- and two - qubits gates .",
    "then we combine the elementary gates of our setup in order to mimic the dynamics of spin and hubbard - like hamiltonians for fermions .",
    "we explicitly report our results for the digital quantum simulation of the transverse - field ising model on 3 qubits , the tunneling dynamics of a spin one in a rhombic crystal field and the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "the robustness of the scheme is demonstrated by including the effects of decoherence in a master equation formalism .",
    "finally , we discuss the main sources of errors in the present simulations and the possibility to overcome them .",

    "b ) . + the basic unit of the scalable array is represented by a pair of qubits connected by an interposed auxiliary resonator containing a superconducting transmon device ( circular box ) , which is employed to perform two - qubit gates .",
    "it should be emphasized that this nonlinear superconducting element is not used to encode any information , and _ it is left in its ground state always except during the implementation of the two - qubit gates_. consequently , its possibly short coherence times do not significantly affect the quantum simulation .",
    "+ in the following , we shall refer to the square boxes as the _ logical _ cavities labelled with greek letters , while the circular ones are the _ auxiliary _ cavities labeled by latin letters .",
    "photon hopping between neighboring resonators is allowed by capacitive coupling .",

    "the first is that using the hybrid encoding with an ensemble of effective @xmath0 spins ensures the possibility of implementing controlled - phase gates between distant qubits , with no need of performing highly demanding and error - prone sequences of swap gates .",
    "this is done by bringing the photon components of the two qubits into neighboring _ logical _ resonators by a series of hopping processes ( see app .",
    "b for details ) . transferring the photons with no corruption and without perturbing the qubits encoded in the interposed _",
    "logical _ cavities is made possible by temporarily storing the photon component of these interposed qubits into the @xmath18 spin oscillator .",
    "+ in addition , quantum simulations can be performed in parallel to a large degree , with resulting reduction of simulation times .",
    "this is made possible by the definitions of the single qubits , represented by each coupled se - resonator device , and by the local control of each _ logical _ or _ auxiliary _ resonator .",
    "non - overlapping parts of the register can then be manipulated in parallel .",
    "for instance , in simulating a heisenberg chain of @xmath1 spins @xmath42 , the @xmath1 two - qubits evolutions which appear at each time - step in the trotter decomposition are performed simultaneously first on all @xmath43 `` even '' bonds and then simultaneously on the remaining @xmath43 `` odd '' bonds .",
    "thus the simulation time of each trotter step does not increase with @xmath1 .",
    "while it is obvious that a universal quantum computer can be used in principle to simulate any hamiltonian , the actual feasibility of such simulations needs to be quantitatively assessed by testing whether the complex sequences of gates needed are robust with respect to errors due to decoherence . here",

    "we have chosen resonator frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 larger than usual experiments ( e.g. , twice the typical frequencies reported in ref .  ) , since this helps improving the maximal fidelity of gates .",

    "in this section we show how the present scheme can be made robust against inhomogenous broadening ( ib ) of the se , which is probably the major shortcoming in its use to encode quantum information .",
    "a certain degree spin inhomogeneity is unavoidable in real ses , and may result from slightly disordered spin environments or by random magnetic fields produced by surrounding nuclear magnetic moments . due to ib , the collective (  super - radiant `` ) spin - excitation that couples to the photon field spontaneously decays into a quasi - continuum of decoupled , `` dark '' spin modes within a timescale of order @xmath149 , @xmath150 being the width of the distribution of gaps in the se .",
    "a possible way to deal with ib is to revert the associated hamiltonian evolution by echo techniques , e.g. by using external magnetic field pulses resonant with the spin gaps @xcite . while possible in principle , implementing such a solution within our simulation scheme would be very demanding .",

    "+ in the non - resonant ( dispersive ) regime , the energy shift of the super - radiant mode is of order @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the collective se - cavity coupling and @xmath153 is the detuning between the resonator frequency and the spin gap . by assuming a spin ensemble with gaussian broadening and standard deviation @xmath150 , the cavity protection condition is fulfilled if @xmath154 .",

    "we have shown the feasibility of the scheme with state - of the - art superconducting arrays technology , which allows the high fidelity simulation of a large class of multi - qubits spin and fermionic models . to test our predictions ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the master equation for the system density matrix , including the most important decoherence channels such as photon loss and pure - dephasing of the transmon involved in two - qubit entangling gates .",
    "coherence times of single spins are so long that their effect on quantum simulations can be disregarded .",

    "three main simulation errors can be found : digital errors ( arising from the trotter - suzuki approximation ) , gating errors ( due to imperfect implementation of the desired unitaries ) , and decoherence errors ( due to the interaction of the quantum simulator with the environment ) . while digital errors can obviously be reduced by increasing the number of trotter steps , gating errors are accumulated by repeating a large number of quantum operations . in the same way",
    "the effects of the interaction of the system with the environment become much more pronounced if the number of gates , and thus the overall simulation time , increases .",
    "first , we notice that the present setup _ limits the role of the transmon _ , which is not involved in the definition of the qubits .",
    "all transmons are kept in their ground states apart for the specific transmons involved in two - qubit gates , which are excited only for a short time .",

    "photon loss represents the main source of decoherence in our hybrid dual - rail encoding .",
    "finally , gating errors are mainly due to the small difference between the photon frequency and transmonic gaps in the auxiliary cavities , which induces a residual interaction that is never completely switched off .",
    "here we use the tunability of the resonator frequency as the only tool to process quantum information , but the flux control of the josephson energy of the transmons can also be exploited to increase the detuning , thus leading to even larger fidelities .",

    "it is clear that a register topology directly mimicking the target hamiltonian would greatly reduce the simulation effort . in particular",
    ", there are several important hamiltonians defined on two - dimensional lattices whose simulation would greatly benefit from a two - dimensional register . here",
    ", we point out that our scheme is straightforwardly usable on such a register , but its experimental realization necessarily requires the implementation of two sub - lattices of cavities , alternatively coupled to spin and transmon qubits , respectively .",

    "[ scheme2d ] displays the schematic drawing of a potential two - dimensional layout showing how such sub - lattices could feasibly realize a two - dimensional simulator .",
    "> from a technological point of view , we notice that similar lattices with transmon qubits have been fabricated with more than 200 coupled cavities .",
    "while local tuning in such a lattice would require local flux bias on a separate layer , this need for local control lines applies to any adjustable quantum simulator .",
    "on the other hand , we notice that a recent technology has shown promising results to bring flux lines to the interior part of a lattice made of a small number of nodes , e.g. by using aluminum airbridge crossovers to route microwave signals into a target resonator @xcite .",
    "+        _ summary_. in conclusion , the proposed setup exploits the best characteristics of distinct physical systems : the long coherence times of the spins , which can encode quantum information and protect it from decoherence , and the mobility of photons entering this hybrid encoding of qubits . in the end",

    "<S> resolving quantum many - body problems represents one of the greatest challenges in physics and physical chemistry , due to the prohibitively large computational resources that would be required by using classical computers . </S>",
    "<S> a solution has been foreseen by directly simulating the time evolution through sequences of quantum gates applied to arrays of qubits , i.e. by implementing a _ digital quantum simulator_. superconducting circuits and resonators are emerging as an extremely - promising platform for quantum computation architectures , but a digital quantum simulator proposal that is straightforwardly scalable , universal , and realizable with state - of - the - art technology is presently lacking . here </S>",
    "<S> we propose a viable scheme to implement a universal quantum simulator with hybrid spin - photon qubits in an array of superconducting resonators , which is intrinsically scalable and allows for local control . </S>",
    "<S> as representative examples we consider the transverse - field ising model , a spin-1 hamiltonian , and the two - dimensional hubbard model ; for these , we numerically simulate the scheme by including the main sources of decoherence . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we show how to circumvent the potentially harmful effects of inhomogeneous broadening of the spin systems .    3 cm </S>"
