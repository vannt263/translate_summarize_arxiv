    "recent experiments at rhic have revealed extensive information on the effects of the dense medium on hadron production at large transverse momentum ( @xmath1 ) @xcite . the suppression of back - to - back correlation relative to the same - side correlation is a strong indication of substantial energy loss suffered by hard partons propagating through the medium @xcite .",
    "it implies then that the jets detected in heavy - ion collisions are produced mainly near the surface of the medium so that the hard partons are less attenuated by the jet quenching effects @xcite .",
    "if that is indeed the case , then a simple fragmentation model would predict that the structure of jets produced in heavy - ion collisions should be basically the same as that of jets in @xmath2 collisions .",
    "that similarity has been shown to be absent in the data of more recent experiments @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate the jet structure by examining the two - particle correlation within a jet produced by nuclear collisions at high energy .",
    "the difference from @xmath2 jets is naturally caused by the presence of thermal partons in the jet environment , which we shall take into account .",
    "the framework in which we shall study hadron production at large @xmath1 is parton recombination , which has been shown to explain some features of the data where fragmentation fails @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the anomaly associated with species dependence of the cronin effect in d+au collisions has also been resolved in the recombination picture @xcite .",
    "the main component that is new in this series of work is the inclusion of shower partons generated by hard partons .",
    "whereas the recombination of two shower partons forms a hadron that can be identified with the fragmentation product in the conventional approach , the recombination of shower partons with thermal partons yield hadrons in the intermediate @xmath1 region that are totally new . here",
    "we go a step further . to study dihadrons in a jet we must consider four partons that recombine to form two hadrons ; some of those partons will be thermal in order to have enhanced yield .",
    "dihadrons formed without thermal partons correspond to those found in jets in vacuum , and are suppressed compared to those hadron pairs that involve the participation of thermal partons .",
    "we shall consider two types of triggers , pion and proton , and calculate the distributions of the associated particles .",
    "since we include the contributions from different species of hard partons , each having various flavors of shower partons , and since the four recombining partons have different momentum fractions that have to be permuted in the recombination formula , the combinatorial complication can result in a hundred terms or more .",
    "for that reason we limit our trigger to only @xmath0 and @xmath6 , which are sufficient to reveal the properties of the jet structures .",
    "detailed comparison of our results to current data is , however , difficult , since the experimental trigger at this stage consists of all charged hadrons , as are the associated particles @xcite . separating triggers to mesons and baryons",
    "has not resulted in any @xmath1 distributions for the associated particles @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , some coarse comparisons with the data can be made , and our results will be shown to be reasonable .",
    "the hadronization process that we consider in order to calculate the dihadron correlation in a jet is parton recombination .",
    "the formalism for single - particle inclusive distribution at high @xmath1 is given in @xcite .",
    "an essential ingredient in the hadronization process is the shower parton distributions ( spd ) , which give the probabilities of finding shower partons of various flavors and momentum fractions in jets initiated by different hard partons @xcite .",
    "convoluting the spd s , denoted by @xmath7 , with the hard - scattered parton distributions @xmath8 in heavy - ion collisions gives the shower component @xmath9 where the sum is over all hard partons , and @xmath10 is the average suppression factor due to energy loss in a dense medium , found to be 0.07 for central au+au collisions at @xmath11 gev @xcite . for two shower partons in the same jet",
    "we have @xmath12 where the curly brackets denote the symmetrization of the leading parton momentum fraction @xmath13 . \\label{3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this symmetrization is necessary , since either @xmath14 or @xmath15 shower parton may be the leading parton in the jet , and eq .",
    "( [ 3 ] ) is a way to ensure that momentum conservation @xmath16 is not violated .",
    "the spd s are determined by solving the recombination formula for the fragmentation functions ( ff ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the recombination function ( rf ) for the hadronization process @xmath19 .    for the hadronization of a hard parton in vacuum it is unnecessary to consider the shower partons , since they recombine to form @xmath20 , as in eq.([4 ] ) , to recover the ff , from which the spd s are obtained . however , in the environment of thermal partons as in heavy - ion collisions the shower partons can recombine with the thermal partons , resulting in hadrons that are dominant in the intermediate @xmath1 region because they benefit from the high density of the thermal partons as well as the higher momenta of the semi - hard shower partons .",
    "the invariant distribution of the thermal partons is parameterized by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the inverse slope enhanced by flow .",
    "since we have no model to describe the hydrodynamical evolution of the bulk medium at low transverse momentum , the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath22 are determined by fitting the low-@xmath1 data .",
    "they are found to be @xcite @xmath24 for central au+au collisions at midrapidity and @xmath25 gev .    with both the thermal @xmath26 and shower distributions @xmath27 known , it is possible to calculate the hadron distribution in the 1d recombination formalism for the formation of a meson @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the joint distribution of a quark @xmath30 at @xmath31 and an antiquark @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "for pion production at high @xmath1 , we put @xmath34 in the transverse plane , abbreviate @xmath1 as @xmath6 , ignore pion mass and write @xcite @xmath35 where the rf @xcite @xmath36 has been used .",
    "for heavy - ion collisions @xmath37 can be written in the form @xmath38 where the possibility of two shower partons from two different jets is ignored .",
    "it is the @xmath39 term in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) that dominates at intermediate @xmath1 , while the @xmath40 and @xmath41 terms are dominant in the low and very high @xmath1 regions , respectively .",
    "two - pion distribution can be obtained by a straightforward extension of the single - particle distribution given in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) , and one gets @xmath42 where sums over different combinations of partons contributing to the two rf s are not exhibited explicitly .",
    "@xmath43 is the joint distribution of two quarks and two antiquarks .",
    "if we are to study the two - pion distribution in a jet , then neither of the two pions should be the hadronization of thermal pions only .",
    "that is , each pion should contain at least one shower parton in order to qualify as a part of the jet . using the terminology `` thermal hadrons '' to refer to the hadronization of thermal partons only ,",
    "then in the experimental analysis of jet structure such thermal hadrons are regarded as background and are subtracted from the set of particles associated with a trigger . in our calculation of @xmath44",
    "associated with a jet , we simply leave out @xmath40 contribution to any pion .",
    "thus there are only two types of terms for @xmath45 , which we represent schematically as @xmath46 where a term of the type @xmath47 is omitted because without @xmath48 it is negligible compared to @xmath49 for hadron @xmath50 gev / c . in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) the parentheses enclose the partons that are to recombine . with that notation @xmath51",
    "is very different from @xmath52 , which contributes to a thermal hadron that we exclude from our consideration .",
    "in addition to two - pion correlation we shall also study the correlation between a pion and a proton in a jet .",
    "the single - baryon distribution has the general form @xmath53 where the rf for proton is @xcite @xmath54 @xmath55^{-1 } \\label{15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath58 joint distribution in a high-@xmath1 jet is @xmath59 the 5-parton distribution @xmath60 has the schematic form @xmath61 where we have omitted terms of the type @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 because they are all negligible compared to the ones in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) .    in the next section",
    "we examine in detail the multi - parton distributions @xmath45 and @xmath60 and how they contribute to the associated particle distributions , when either the pion or the proton is used as a trigger .",
    "to select the appropriate two - particle distributions to calculate , let us examine the type of quantities that have been measured experimentally .",
    "there exist data from rhic experiments that give some properties of charged particles associated with triggers detected in certain @xmath1 ranges @xcite we shall therefore calculate distributions with similar kinematic ranges . because of detection limitations there is at present no particle identification in either the trigger or the associated particles",
    ". we shall , nevertheless , do the calculations for specific particle species in anticipation for the corresponding data that will become available in the future .",
    "in particular , we shall consider @xmath0 and @xmath6 as trigger particles , and @xmath65 and @xmath6 as associated particles .",
    "considering all charged particles would involve overwhelming complications and uncertainties without gaining clarity .",
    "the two - particle distributions given in eqs .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 16 ] ) do not explicitly specify what the two particles at @xmath66 and @xmath67 are within the same jet .",
    "the jet momentum @xmath68 , which is the momentum of the initiating hard parton , is imbedded in the expression for the shower partons , eq.([2 ] ) , and is integrated over all values in a collision .",
    "when the two - parton distribution , such as that given in eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) , is generalized to @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , it is important to make sure that the hard partons in each of @xmath69 in ( [ 12 ] ) are one and the same , and similarly in eq .",
    "( [ 17 ] ) . to make this point explicit ,",
    "it is helpful to write the two - particle distribution within one jet as @xmath70 , so that all shower partons are associated with the hard parton @xmath71 at momentum @xmath68 .",
    "then the particle @xmath72 distribution associated to a trigger particle @xmath73 at @xmath66 is @xmath74 further integration of eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) over @xmath66 in the specified range of the trigger momentum yields the distribution of the associated particles that is measured .",
    "note that the energy loss suppression factor @xmath10 is cancelled in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) . in the following our expressions for @xmath69 will not contain @xmath75 that appears in eqs .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) , since it is now shown explicitly in eq .  ( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "let us consider first @xmath0 trigger , and @xmath76 , and @xmath6 associated with it .",

    "for every given @xmath71 , the shower parton @xmath14 can be @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "there are therefore 28 possible spd s . for @xmath84 in a jet , @xmath45 for four partons has three terms @xmath85 where the first pair of parentheses in each term correspond to the trigger , the second the associated particle .",
    "we omit the term @xmath86 because it is negligible .",
    "note that it is the only term contributing to two particles in a jet produced in @xmath2 collisions , since there are no thermal partons of any significance in the environment . herein lies already the difference between jets produced in heavy - ion and hadronic collisions , without even any quantitative details to be investigated . for @xmath84 ,",
    "@xmath14 should only be @xmath77 or @xmath81 within each of the six sets of parentheses ; the thermal partons should just be given the flavor of the complement to make a @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath87 .",

    "[ 5 ] ) can be used for @xmath77 , @xmath78 and their antiquarks . the situation with the shower partons are far more complicated .",
    "their distributions depend on the species of the initial hard parton @xmath71 and the shower parton @xmath14 .",
    "however , by not considering the production of kaons and hyperons , there are only three basic spd s : @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 .",
    "we can write @xmath7 in the matrix form @xmath113 for example , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 .",
    "antiquarks are like quarks of different flavors , i.e , @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , etc .",

    "the parametrizations of the spd s are given in ref.@xcite , in which one can also find a thorough discussion of why @xmath121 is excluded due to gluon conversion . in eqs .",
    "( [ 20])-([25 ] ) the label @xmath71 for hard partons is suppressed , but is shown explicitly in eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "the subscripts of @xmath69 in those equations correspond to the label @xmath14 above .",
    "thus for every fixed @xmath71 all the @xmath122 distributions in eqs.([20])-([25 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",

    "further complications arise when the constraint due to momentum conservation is to be applied .",
    "since the sum of the momenta of shower partons in a jet can not exceed the hard parton momentum @xmath68 , the momentum fractions in the arguments of the spd s can not be independent . in eqs .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 17 ] ) there are terms where @xmath69 appears twice or thrice . let the momenta of the two - quark case be denoted by @xmath139 and @xmath140 , and let us consider the term @xmath141 in eq.([32 ] ) for illustration .",

    "( [ 33 ] ) , we symmetrize as follows @xmath147\\ . \\label{35}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the procedure for our calculation is now completely specified .",
    "to provide an understanding of the order of magnitude of the various terms , let us first give the result of @xmath84 correlation in central au+au collisions at @xmath25 gev .",
    "since the star data @xcite are for the trigger momentum in the range @xmath148 gev / c , we calculate @xmath149 where the rhs is defined by eq .",
    "( [ 18 ] ) .",
    "the result is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "the dashed line indicates the contribution from the first term in eq.([19 ] ) that has the structure @xmath150 , while the dash - dot line represents the next two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) that are of the form @xmath151 .",
    "the solid line is their sum . clearly , the overall distribution is dominated by the component that involves two thermal partons due to the high density of those soft partons . each time",
    "a thermal parton is replaced by a shower parton in their recombination , the yield is lower .",
    "for that reason we have not bothered to calculate the contribution from @xmath152 , which corresponds to the double application of the fragmentation function .",
    "presumably such contributions can become important at very large @xmath1 , where the effects of thermal parton are insignificant . to generate four shower partons in a jet resulting in two pions each with @xmath153",
    "gev / c would require a much harder collision than is necessary if some thermal partons can participate .",
    "the issue here is not which channels a hard parton hadronizes into , given a value of @xmath68 ( as one considers in fragmentation ) , but rather , given two pions at @xmath66 and @xmath67 , what the most favorable value of @xmath68 is in the environment of dense thermal partons ( as one considers in recombination ) .",
    "we next consider the dependence on the density of thermal partons .",
    "since we have already investigated d+au collisions in connection with the cronin effect @xcite , where the soft parton distributions ( called thermal also ) have been determined for various centralities , we calculate @xmath154 correlation for three cases : central au+au ( 0 - 5% ) , central d+au ( 0 - 20% ) and peripheral d+au ( 60 - 90% ) . the result is shown in fig",
    ".  2 , where the three cases are represented , respectively , by solid , dashed and dash - dot lines .",
    "evidently , the density of thermal partons has a crucial effect on the yield of the associated particles . since peripheral ( 60 - 90% )",
    "d+au collisions are almost equivalent to @xmath2 collisions , we can see directly from fig .  2 that the structures of jets in central au+au and @xmath2 collisions are drastically different .",
    "if we plot the ratio of the spectra for central au+au to peripheral d+au in linear scale , we get the solid curve in fig .  3 .",
    "the ratio of central d+au to peripheral d+au is shown by the dashed line .",
    "the former ratio exceeds 5 around @xmath155 gev / c and remains large throughout the intermediate @xmath1 range .",
    "we now have strong evidence that the structure of jets in nuclear collisions is very different from that in hadronic collisions .",
    "we now consider @xmath0 , @xmath156 and @xmath6 production associated with a @xmath157 trigger in the 4 to 6 gev / c range .",
    "4 shows the three contributions by the thin solid @xmath158 , dashed @xmath159 and dash - dot lines @xmath160 , with the sum indicated by the thick solid line .",
    "the data points are from star , which includes all charged hadrons in both the trigger and the associated particles @xcite .",
    "since what is calculated is not exactly what is measured , one should not expect perfect agreement .",
    "however , @xmath0 is a dominant component of the trigger , and the data average over different trigger particles , whereas the different associated particles are summed .",
    "thus what is calculated should not differ greatly from what is measured .",
    "indeed , the agreement is very good both in normalization and in shape .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to infer that our approach has captured the essence of the physics of hadronization .",
    "it is interesting to note that the yield of @xmath105 is higher than that of @xmath0 when the trigger is @xmath157 , as is evident in fig .",
    "the reason is that when @xmath71 is summed over all hard parton species , the cases when @xmath161 and @xmath80 can give rise to valence shower partons that enhance the @xmath156 production through the @xmath110 distribution , but not the @xmath0 production .",
    "when @xmath123 and @xmath81 , the trigger uses up the valence shower parton to form @xmath157 so the associated particle , whether @xmath157 or @xmath105 , has to be formed by the sea shower parton through the @xmath111 distribution , resulting in no big difference between @xmath157 or @xmath105 . thus adding up the contributions from all hard partons results in more @xmath105 than @xmath157 in a @xmath157 triggered jet",
    "this is a prediction that can be checked by experiments with good particle identification .",
    "we also note that the proton yield in fig .  4 is greater than the @xmath157 yield in the 2 - 3 gev / c range because a @xmath77 or @xmath78 shower parton can recombine with two thermal partons , thereby increasing the @xmath162 ratio for the same reason that the ratio exceeds 1 without trigger @xcite-@xcite . however , the proton yield is less than the @xmath105 yield in the @xmath0 triggered jet , since @xmath136 does not have the advantage of the @xmath80-initiated jet that enhances the @xmath163 production .    finally , we come to the proton trigger and show in fig .  5 the result of our calculation for the associated particles being @xmath157 and @xmath105 , in dashed and dash - dot lines , respectively .",
    "the solid line is their sum .",
    "the normalization and shape of the total distribution for the associated particles are roughly the same as those in fig .  4 for @xmath0 trigger . the @xmath157 and @xmath105 components have no noticeable difference ( bearing in mind that the @xmath105 curve is lowered by a factor of 2 to avoid overlap ) . that is reasonable , since @xmath164 and @xmath80 favor @xmath157 and @xmath105 equally , while @xmath123 and @xmath78 are both used in the trigger , leaving @xmath157 and @xmath105 again on comparable footing .",
    "these features can also be checked directly by experiments when particle identification is improved .    in the foregoing",
    "we have presented the distributions of the associated particles , which offer more details than the overall yields .",
    "the latter provide a short and useful summary of the jet structure that is easier to measure .",
    "we therefore calculate the three lowest moments of the distributions that have already been obtained @xmath165 where @xmath166 is the @xmath1 distribution of all the particles associated with trigger @xmath167 that we have calculated : @xmath157 , @xmath105 and @xmath6 for @xmath168 , and @xmath157 and @xmath105 for @xmath169",
    ". the lower limit of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ 37 ] ) is set at 0.5 gev / c because our calculated result is not reliable for @xmath170 gev / c ; the upper limit is set at 4.5 gev / c , since we do not want it to exceed the average of the trigger momentum that is between 4 and 6 gev / c .",
    "thus , by definition , @xmath171 is a measure of the average number of particles associated with trigger @xmath167 , @xmath172 being the total scalar @xmath1 of those particles , and @xmath173 the total @xmath174 of them .",
    "the last quantity is insensitive to the low @xmath67 behavior of @xmath166 , and is a good measure for comparison between theory and experiment .",
    "our results on @xmath175 for central au+au collisions are shown in table i. note that    .values of the moments @xmath175 for central au+au at @xmath25 gev [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath176  [ au+au ( central)]/[d+au ( peripheral ) ] are 4.8 , 4.9 and 4.9 for @xmath177 , respectively .",
    "they are very similar and roughly 5 .",
    "we expect that if all particles associated with the trigger are included , the ratio will remain about the same .    there are some data on total charged multiplicity and total scalar @xmath1 , but they include the trigger @xcite .",
    "the ratio for [ au+au ( central)]/@xmath2 on multiplicity is @xmath178 , and on scalar @xmath1 is @xmath179 . by subtracting out the trigger contribution ,",
    "it is possible to see a rough agreement with our result ; however , we leave the quantification of the comparison to the experiments .",
    "we have studied the structure of jets produced in heavy - in collisions by calculating dihadron correlation in the framework of parton recombination .",
    "since the jets are produced in the environment of dense partonic medium , they are different from the ones produced in @xmath2 collisions and @xmath180 annihilation .",
    "the interaction between the hard and soft partons is very important .",
    "it is taken into account in our study by allowing shower partons to recombine with the thermal partons . since",
    "our formalism has been applied successfully to single - particle spectra in previous studies , we have no freedom to adjust any part of our treatment of the two - particle distributions , nor is there any free parameter to vary .",
    "all the results shown in the previous section are predictions .    in our approach to hadron production at high and intermediate @xmath1 the effect of energy loss by the hard partons traversing the dense medium is represented by a multiplicative factor @xmath10 .",
    "that factor is cancelled in our definition of the associated particle distribution , which is the ratio of the two - particle distribution to the trigger - particle distribution .",
    "thus the dihadron correlation in a jet that we calculate is independent of the degree of jet quenching .",
    "it can be compared to the corresponding data on the near - side jet , since such jets are produced by hard collisions near the surface facing the detector and suffer minimal energy loss .",
    "unfortunately , inadequate particle identification renders unfeasible direct comparison between the currently available data with our predictions .    in principle , it is possible to calculate what has currently been measured , i.e. , all charged hadrons in the trigger and other particles in the jet . in practice , the task would be dauntingly complicated and involve many more terms than what we have already considered , including thermal @xmath79 partons whose parametrizations have been less reliably determined . besides , the current data are in a passing phase ; better particle identification is forth - coming .",
    "what we have calculated are for clean triggers and associated particles , and can be effectively compared with future data .",
    "it is evident from the results of our study that the dihadron correlation is dominated by the components that involve the highest number of thermal partons .",
    "the recombination mechanism boosts the yield when high - density thermal partons are included , but also boosts the @xmath1 of the product when the semi - hard shower partons are involved .",
    "the effect has already been shown to operate in the single - particle distributions , but now exhibits itself more conspicuously in dihadron correlations in jets , since at least four partons are involved , two of which can be thermal .",
    "the difference between jets produced in heavy - ion collisions compared to those produced in @xmath2 collisions is huge , as evidenced by the large ratio shown by the solid line in fig .  3 and by the ratios of the moments in table ii  about 5 between the first and third rows of values .",
    "it is hard to see how the properties of the dihadron correlations in jets that we have found can be reproduced in any fragmentation model even with medium modification of the fragmentation function , whose focus has been on the effect of energy loss @xcite .",
    "there are terms in our recombination formulas , when the shower parton momenta are symmetrized , that can not be written in factorizable forms involving products of two ff s . leaving aside such technical details ,",
    "let us accept the conceivable possibility that perturbative branching of a hard parton can generate hard shower partons , and that they can further fragment by means of suitable modified ff s that mimic @xmath39 recombination .",
    "if it is successful in the end , it seems that the scheme would have lost the original advantage of the fragmentation approach that relies on the universality of the ff s .",
    "if the modification of a ff depends sensitively on the detailed properties of the partonic medium , then , by comparison , @xmath39 recombination would seem to be a more direct and physically cogent approach to hadronization .",
    "besides , as pointed out earlier , energy loss is not the issue in dihadron correlation .",
    "there are limitations to the formalism that we have used for our calculations .",
    "we have not considered the @xmath181 dependence of dihadron correlation , since the spd s used are for @xmath182 fixed at 10 gev / c @xcite .",
    "that limitation is not a matter of principle , but of practice . to account for the @xmath181 evolution of the spd s",
    "is a worthwhile problem in its own right , inasmuch as the same problem for the ff s has been pursued for decades @xcite . to apply that evolutionary property to the dihadron correlation would be prohibitively complicated .",
    "attempts have been initiated to investigate the evolutionary aspect of dihadron distribution of the fragmentation process in the operator formalism @xcite .",
    "an input on the initial distribution for such an evolution would still have to involve the type of consideration presented here .",
    "furthermore , how the thermal partons are to be incorporated in that approach is not clear .    another limitation is rooted in our formalism . since we have relied entirely on our 1d formulation of recombination ,",
    "it is not possible in the same formalism to address the question of angular correlation in a jet .",
    "since jets are 3d objects , it is obvious that longitudinal - transverse correlation within a jet can contain information about the properties of the recombining partons that we can not probe in the simplified 1d formalism .",
    "clearly , despite the substantial progress that has been made in our line of investigation , there remains much ground to improve and generalize in the study of the physics of hadronization in heavy - ion collisions .",
