    "4 ) . for the sake of brevity",
    ", the different spectral models will occasionally be referred to by their number as given in table 1 .",
    "the x - ray lightcurve of ngc 3786 is shown in fig .",
    "[ light ] . due to",
    "the wobble in the telescope s pointing direction which causes a time dependent shadowing of the source s image by the supporting grids , a reliable estimate of the source count rate is possible only by averaging the count rate over an entire wobble period of 400s .",
    "since , usually , the total exposure time per satellite s orbit is not an integer multiple of 400s , incomplete last bins were rejected in producing the x - ray lightcurve .    the count rate during the pointed observation is constant within the errors .",
    "the source is found to be strongly variable on a longer timescale , however , since it is much weaker during the 2-year earlier survey observation .",
    "the change in count rate ( 0.36 cts / s in the 1992 observation , 0.038 cts / s in 1990 ) is about a factor of 10 .",
    "based purely on the quality of the x - ray spectral fits , three different models turn out to be successful : a black body , a flat powerlaw , and a warm - absorbed powerlaw of canonical spectral index .",
    "we favour the third one , since ( besides hints for an absorption edge ) the first two are very unusual as judged from previous x - ray observations of the class of seyfert galaxies , and the presence of a dusty warm absorber also fits to other properties and observations of ngc 3786 ( as detailed in sect .",
    "thermal emission ( although not necessarily of black - body - like shape ) or a flat powerlaw may arise from a nuclear starburst , i.e. hot gas and/or supernova remnants and x - ray binaries . however , no other evidence of such a component is reported for ngc 3786 , and the x - ray luminosity we find ( a few 10@xmath78 erg / s ) overpredicts the one typically observed in galaxies with nuclear starbursts by a factor of @xmath010@xmath79 ( e.g. fabbiano 1989 ) . furthermore , such emission is not expected to vary by a factor of @xmath010 within the timescale of 2 years . for a powerlaw emitted by the active nucleus ,",

    "1994 , nandra et al .",

    "the presence of a warm absorber removes the need for invoking such an unusually flat powerlaw , and strong evidence for ionized absorbers has been found in several of the well - studied seyfert galaxies ( cf .",
    "fabian 1996 for a review ) .",
    "the amount of _ cold _ absorption present in ngc 3786 is more uncertain . a warm absorber model with galactic",
    "only already provides a successful fit .",
    "the warm material is found to be relatively lowly ionized in this case , @xmath80 ( still somewhat higher than is typical for the broad line region ( blr ) itself ) , and also contributes to the low - energy absorption ( fig .",
    "[ wa_def ] ) .",
    "a successful alternative description is a more highly ionized absorber combined with excess cold absorption .",
    "the properties of the warm absorber are further discussed below in the context of the sy 1.8 classification of ngc 3786 .",
    "an interesting characteristic of intermediate type seyferts like ngc 3786 is the often rather steep balmer decrement of the blr as compared to sy 1s .",
    "there are essentially two kinds of interpretations of the high observed h@xmath81/h@xmath82 flux ratio offered in the literature : one invokes reddening by dust along the line of sight , the other special properties of the blr gas itself .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the intrinsic flux ratio is near the case - b recombination ( brocklehurst 1971 ) value , and the observed deviations from that are caused by dust extinction ( e.g. osterbrock 1981 ) .",
    "some authors ( e.g. osterbrock 1981 ; goodrich 1989 , 1995 ) suggest the dust to be located in the outer blr or just outside the blr .",
    "this ensures dust survival , since dust is expected to be destroyed in the bulk of the blr due to heating by the central radiation field and dust - gas interactions ( e.g. netzer 1990 ) , and accounts for the usually less steep observed balmer decrements of the nlr .",
    "maiolino & rieke ( 1995 ) propose the absorption to take place further outwards , in a 100 pc - scale torus ( e.g. mcleod & rieke 1995 ) coplanar with the galactic disk ( their fig .",
    "6 ) .    in the second interpretation ( e.g. canfield & puetter 1981 ; rudy et al . 1988 ) , the flux ratio is _ intrinsically _ high .",
    "high values can be reached in a narrow range of optical depths and ionization parameters of the broad line gas ( canfield & puetter 1981 ) .",
    "evidence for the dust interpretation in some objects was presented by goodrich ( 1989 , 1995 ) based on line variability studies . in another approach , goodrich ( 1990 ) distinguished between both scenarios based on",
    "the pa@xmath70 luminosity predicted in each case . for ngc 3786",
    "he found no clear preference for either model .    in the present study",
    ", we find strong evidence for excess absorption along the line of sight to the x - ray continuum .",
    "however , due to the limited spectral resolution , the exact relative contributions of a warm and cold absorber can not be clearly disentangled , and several models that provide a successful fit are interesting in the light of the sy 1.8 character of ngc 3786 : model 5 ( table 1 ) is reminiscent of the maiolino&rieke scenario , if we interpret the cold absorption to represent the outer torus , and the high-@xmath26 ( dust - free ) warm absorber the inner torus that is just grazed along the l.o.s . on the other hand , in model 6 the dust mixed with the warm absorber",
    "would be located between blr and nlr , more similar to the goodrich scenario .    given the different best - fit ( warm or cold ) absorbing columns we may ask which of the successful x - ray spectral models agrees best with the observed balmer decrement .",
    "( we note that the optical and x - ray observations are not simultaneous , and time - dependent changes in the amount of reddening can not be excluded ; see also next section ) .",

    "the narrow - line ratio , h@xmath85/h@xmath86 = 2.5 , is near the case - b recombination value , indicating no reddening . assuming that dust is indeed responsible for the steep balmer decrement of the broad lines , and accompanied by an amount of cold gas as found in the galaxy , we expect an absorbing column of   @xmath87 @xmath13 ( e.g. bohlin et al . 1978",
    "; see also predehl & schmitt 1995 ) .",
    "this is even larger than the value derived for the cold absorbing column in model 5 ( table 1 ) .",
    "however , interestingly , it is very near the _ warm _ column @xmath25 obtained for the fit of a dusty warm absorber .",
    "ionized material with internal dust between nlr and blr would therefore offer a nice explanation for the observed reddening properties .",
    "the dusty gas is expected to further reveal its presence in the optical  uv spectral region : _ if _ the observed x - ray and uv continuum originate in a region of comparable extent as compared to that of the absorber , and travel along the same paths , the optical  uv continuum will be altered by gas absorption lines and dust reddening .",
    "the equivalent widths of the uv absorption lines civ@xmath241549 and nv@xmath241240 predicted to originate from the dusty warm absorber ( model 6 ; the values for models 5,7,4 , respectively , are given in brackets ) are @xmath88/@xmath89 ( 3.06 , 3.01 , 2.90 ) and @xmath90/@xmath91 ( 3.13 , 3.09 , 2.98 ; for a velocity parameter @xmath92 = 60 km / s , spitzer 1978 )",

    "a factor of @xmath010 variability in count rate is detected between the 2-year - separated observations .",
    "pure _ intrinsic _ continuum variability is one possibility , another one is that we may have witnessed an event of increased absorption during the survey observation due to either ( a ) changes in the cold ( or warm ) _ column density _ , or , ( b ) a reaction of the _ ionization state _ of the warm absorber to ( small ) changes in the intrinsic luminosity .",
    "events of changing emission - line extinction , on the timescale of years , have been reported by goodrich ( 1989 , 1995 ) for some intermediate seyferts .",

    "first of all , we note that due to the relative ` hardness ' of the x - ray spectrum , comparatively high absorption will be required to change the count rate by a factor of 10 ( since cold absorption mainly affects the low - e region , which already only weakly contributes to the total count rate during the pointed observation . )",
    "the high expected columns are not unusual for blr clouds or warm absorbers , though . more specifically ,",
