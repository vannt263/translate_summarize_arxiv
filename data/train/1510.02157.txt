    "in real materials , a perfect crystal is an  ennoblement \" , i.e. an idealized state .",
    "it is fundamentally important to understand the imperfections in real crystalline materials , and studying of the science behind these crystal irregularities is critical to functional materials design and engineering.@xcite it is the feasibility of creating geometrically - imperfect materials that allows us to  custom - make \" new materials with assorted materials functions and properties that modern technological devices desire . in this sense ,",
    "one of the most important characteristics of a material s microstructure are these very imperfections that are exploited for the engineering design of new materials.@xcite    of late , two - dimensional ( 2d ) nanomaterials have attracted a lot of interest from the optoelectronics community.@xcite since the successful isolation of graphene ( from its bulk form  graphite)@xcite and the 2d metal dichalcogenides ( e.g. mos@xmath0),@xcite the high carrier mobilities of these 2d nanomaterials has sparked great expectations as the most probable candidates to supersede and replace traditional semiconductors in key nanodevices e.g. the field - effect transistor ( fet).@xcite    however , after much enthusiasm and anticipation , it has become clear that graphene , which is a semi - metal , does not possess a band gap needed for proper device operations while many of these 2d metal dichalcogenides suffer from the existence of deep defect states in the middle of the band gap.@xcite these defects are often a result of line defects at the grain boundaries ( gbs ) which can act as unwanted electron - hole recombination centers that hinders and degrades nanodevice performance.@xcite     wigner - seitz cell . to generate line / fault defects , namely ( c ) the _ rotation method _ ( upper panel ) and ( d ) the _ fault method _ ( lower panel ) can be employed.,scaledwidth=65.0% ]    yet another recently discovered 2d element ",
    "phosphorene,@xcite the 2d analogue of bulk phosphorous , has been placed in the spotlight for its high carrier mobility and a tunable direct electronic band gap.@xcite 2d phosphorene , which has puckered repeating unit geometry ( as illustrated in figs.[figure1]a ( top - view ) and [ figure1]b ( side - view ) ) , is also found to have superior mechanical flexibility , as compared to other 2d nanomaterials.@xcite    to date , much attention has been given to point and substitutional defects in 2d nanomaterials .",
    "here , we focus on one - dimensional ( 1d ) line defects where these prevalent ( but less studied ) defects may be found at the interfaces of such two - dimensional nanomaterials ( e.g. grain boundaries and micro - faceted nanocrystals ) .",
    "a detailed discussion of electronically benign point and line defects in phosphorene was recently reported by liu _",
    "et al._,@xcite including a survey of the role of gb orientation on the overall electronic structure of the defected system .",
    "here they found that , in contrary to the 2d metal dichalcogenides , these one - dimensional ( 1d ) defects at the gbs do not induce mid - gap defect trap states , and further show that the carrier type and concentration of this recently identified 2d phosphorene could be controlled via selective chemical doping .    conventionally in literature ,",
    "two different methods have been proposed to generate line defects in these 2d nanosystems.@xcite first of all , one may apply the so - called _ rotation method_,@xcite whereby one rotates part of the 2d nanostructure while keeping the remaining part fixed , i.e. generating an  angled \" line defect . upon changing the degrees of rotation",
    ", different line defect structures can be formed with varying contact angles between the two rotated parts ( as in fig.[figure1]c ) .",
    "alternately , one might adopt the so - called _ fault method _ , following after the recent theoretical study of line defects in both graphene and hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath1-bn).@xcite here , two different approaches to create line faults in 2d nanomaterials were suggested , namely the stacking fault method and the growth fault method , respectively . in essence , the stacking fault method involves the addition of an extra row of atoms in the middle of the normal stacking sequence , whereas the growth fault method removes one row of atoms in the normal stacking sequence ( i.e. creating a  missing - row \" .",
    "refer to fig.[figure1]d ) .",
    "we stress that the defect structures obtained by both _ rotation method _ and _ fault method _ are atomically different , and thus a comparative study of both methods will further our understanding of various one - dimensional line defects in phosphorene . in this work , we used first - principles density - functional theory calculations to discuss the energetics and electronic structure of these 1d fault line defects , and compare with those reported in ref . as well as other 2d nanomaterials like graphene and @xmath1-bn .",
    "in this work , periodic density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations are performed using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method , as implemented in the vienna _ ab initio _ simulation package ( vasp).@xcite the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation functional due to perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe ) is used.@xcite a planewave kinetic energy cutoff of 500ev is applied and the irreducible brillouin zone integrations are performed using a @xmath2-centered * k*-point mesh of 4@xmath33@xmath31 for the @xmath4 supercell ( with 96 atoms ) and a 2@xmath36@xmath31 * k*-mesh for the @xmath5 supercell ( with 104 atoms ) . to accurately describe the electronic structures , hse06",
    "hybrid functional calculations are performed to obtain density - of - states ( dos ) and electronic work function with the same * k*-meshes used in pbe calculations . to minimize the spurious interaction between repeating phosphorene layers in the out - of - plane direction ( i.e. the @xmath6-direction ) , a vacuum region of 15",
    "is applied along the @xmath6-direction of supercell .",
    "also , in the effort to minimize the lateral interactions between each periodic image of the line defects in these phosphorene layers , a defect - defect distance of at least 9 is ensured .",
    "all energies and forces are converged to less than 20mev and 0.02ev /  , respectively .",
    "due to the puckered atomic geometry of a single - layered phosphorene , there exists two distinct ways to add an additional row of atoms in pristine phosphorene , along the so - called  armchair \" direction .",
    "on one hand , an additional row of atoms can be added with the same stacking sequence as found in pristine phosphorene .",
    "this results in the 4:8p line defect structure  a _ parallel _ ( hence , p ) puckered structure with sequential rectangular ( hence , 4 ) and octagonal ( hence , 8) ring pair along this fault line , as in fig.[figure2]a .    on the other hand , a single atomic row can be inserted with",
    "a reversed  up - and - down \"- like structure , owing to its puckered nature . here",
    ", the 4:8c line defect structure is obtained  a _ crossing _ ( hence , c ) puckered structure with a sequential rectangular ring and octagonal ring pair along the fault line , as shown in fig.[figure2]b .    for both 4:8p and 4:8c , minimal structural relaxation is observed . in the case of 4:8p ,",
    "the calculated distance between repeated atomic rows is slightly increased from 2.21 to 2.25 , while for the 4:8c structure , a slight outward relaxation of the rectangular ring towards the vacuum is observed , and the distance between repeated atomic rows is also increased further to 2.36 .      similarly to the stacking fault method , due to its puckered nature , the growth fault method presents two different ways of removing a single atomic row from the pristine phosphorene layer , along the so - called  zigzag \" direction .",
    "thus , the two adjacent planes will then have two distinct ways of attachment across the fault .",
    "in particular , the two planes could either be directly connected , or by flipping just one plane by @xmath7 about the fault line before connecting to the other . for the latter case",
    ", this means that the uppermost atomic layer now matches that of the bottom - most layer , and vice versa .    from these considerations , two different initial growth fault line defect structures , namely 4:4 t and 4:4s are formed , respectively .",
    "specifically , in the case of 4:4s , upon removing one of uppermost atomic row , a single ( hence , s ) atomic row remains in that layer along the fault line with sequential rhombus rings ( hence , 4 as seen in fig.[figure2]c ) , while for 4:4 t , due to the vertical flipping over of one plane , there now exist three ( hence , t ) atoms in the same layer along the fault line with sequential rhombus rings ( hence , 4 as in fig.[figure2]d ) .",
    "in addition to these 4:4-type line defects , singh _ et al . _ proposed two other 4:4-derived families of line defects for @xmath1-bn and graphene , specifically the 6:5:8:4:8:5 and 5:5:8 line defect structures.@xcite in accordance with ref . , we have also constructed similar line defect structures for single - layered phosphorene ",
    "6:5:8:4:8:5 , 5:5:8s , and 5:5:8 t , respectively . following the naming convention for the line defects mentioned above , as shown in fig.[figure2]e",
    ", the 6:5:8:4:8:5 structure has as many @xmath8th - sided polygons joining sequentially along the line defect as listed accordingly . for 5:5:8s ( as in fig.[figure2]f )",
    ", it shows two slightly folded pentagonal ring paired with one octagonal ring , and a single outermost top atom exposed along the fault line , which dimerizes with the neighboring atom ( i.e. forming p - p pairs ) after geometry relaxation .",
    "it is worth noting that this structure relaxes to a rather non - planar 2d structure , exhibiting an bent angle of @xmath9 . for the 5:5:8 t structure in fig.[figure2]g",
    ", it has three outermost atoms along the fault line defect , with one almost flat pentagonal ring and one almost @xmath10-folded pentagonal ring paired with a similarly folded octagonal ring .",
    "essentially , many of these stacking fault line defects maintain their perfect planar geometry ( see figs.[figure2]a and [ figure2]b ) while those due to growth faults relax to a non - planar geometry with much surface rumpling and wrinkling ( as seen in figs.[figure2]c to [ figure2]g ) .",
    "this off - planar buckling behavior has been reported for similar multi - center defects in other 2d nanomaterials ( e.g. large - angle grain - boundary defects in graphene and @xmath1-bn).@xcite",
    ".line defect formation energy ( @xmath11 ) , band gap ( @xmath12 ) , and work function ( @xmath13 ) of 1d line defects ( lds ) in various 2d nanomaterials : phosphorene , @xmath1-bn , and graphene .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ table1 ]        to study and determine the relative energetic stability of these 1d line defects in single - layered phosphorene , we define the 1d line defect formation energy per unit length of the line defect , @xmath11 using the following equation : @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the total energy of the single - layered phosphorene with a line defect , the total energy of pristine , defect - free single - layered phosphorene , the number of p atoms in the defect system , and the length of the line defect in the defect system , respectively . since the basal unit is the length of the line defect , we can think of the calculated @xmath11 ( in ev /  ) as the additional energy required to form an unit length of line defect for a given pristine single - layered phosphorene .",
    "now , to collectively address the various line defects in phosphorene , graphene , and @xmath1-bn under typical growth conditions , we relate the defect area density,@xcite @xmath19 as a function of temperature , @xmath20 using the simple arrhenius equation , @xmath21 here , the atom area density of the defect - free pristine 2d material is represented by @xmath22 and is found to be @xmath23m@xmath24 , @xmath25m@xmath24 , and @xmath26m@xmath24 for phosphorene , graphene , and @xmath1-bn , respectively . in this case , the defect formation energy , @xmath27 is normalized with respect to number of atoms per line defect length .    as seen in in tab.[table1 ] , the formation energies of the fault line defects in phosphorene considered in this work are found to be fairly small in magnitude and are also considerably much lower than their counterparts in either @xmath1-bn or graphene , as reported in ref .. in line with ref .",
    ", the energetics of phosphorene grain boundary line defects were calculated to be between 0.05 to 0.14ev /  , lending to the fact that all these 1d defects in phosphorene may have fairly similar chemical stability to defect - free phosphorene than the case for other 2d nanomaterials .",
    "our calculations suggest that many , if not all , of these low energy line defects may very well occur in potential polycrystalline phosphorene - based optoelectronic nanodevices . in comparison to other 2d materials like graphene and @xmath1-bn ( in fig.[figure3]b ) , their line defects tend to occur only at higher temperatures ( above 400k ) and the corresponding @xmath19 are almost an order of magntitude less than that of phosphorene line defects .",
    "in fact , uniquely , the 5:5:8s line defect exhibits a remarkably low defect formation energy of 0.01ev /  , i.e. almost _ close - to - zero _ value . in fig.[figure3]a , under typical growth conditions with @xmath20 between 300 to 800k , the 5:5:8s fault line defect structure is predicted to have a very high @xmath19 as compared to other line defects ( including those @xmath28 line defects as reported in ref . ) . given its slightly bent geometry with p - p dimer pairs along the fault line",
    ", we further investigate the effect of lateral strain on the ultra - low energy line defect 5:5:8s by varying the length of the longest edge up to @xmath2910@xmath30 .",
    "we find that the average p - p bond length , the bent angle , and the total energy of this line defect change negligibly by less than 0.003 , @xmath31 , and 1mev per phosphorus atom .",
    "this seems to suggest that this ultra - low energy 5:5:8s defect is indeed bent and stable under lateral strain which can become important in actual working nanodevices .",
    "having identified these very low energy 1d line defect structures in single - layered phosphorene , we now turn to their electronic structures .",
    "it was recently reported that intrinsic point defects and grain boundaries in single - layered phosphorene are electronically benign / inactive , i.e. preserving the semiconducting nature of phosphorene.@xcite the authors believe that unlike other heteronuclear 2d nanomaterials ( e.g. the metal dichalcogenides ) , the so - called _ homoelemental _ bonding in phosphorene accounts for this  absence of chemical disorder \" , and thus mitigates the formation of deep gap states.@xcite    starting with single - layered defect - free phosphorene , we calculate the total electronic density - of - states ( dos ) using the hse06 hybrid functional , and the @xmath12 is found to be 1.60ev which is in good agreement with other theoretical values.@xcite surprisingly , in contrary to the grain boundary defects studied in ref . , we find that the 4:4s , and 4:4 t line defect structures exhibit a metallic behavior ( figs.[figure4]c and [ figure4]d ) while 4:8p , 4:8c , 5:5:8s , 5:5:8 t , and 6:5:8:4:8:5 yield a semiconducting band gap , @xmath12 ( figs.[figure4]a , [ figure4]b , [ figure4]e , and [ figure4]f ) .",
    "all considered line defect structures doe not possess a net magnetic spin moment .    taking a closer look at the proposed low energy line defects in this work",
    ", we find that those structures containing the square - shaped motifs ( hence , 4-fold which deviates from the pristine 3-fold coordination ) are metallic ( i.e. with no gap ) .",
    "this lack of topological bond preservation ( with respect to the 3-fold coordination in pristine phosphorene ) explains the observed metallic behavior that was not seen for the grain boundary defects in ref ..    on the other hand , those defect structures preserving the 3-fold p centers ( including those with pentagon - shaped motifs ) are indeed  electronically benign / inactive \" , maintaining a fairly similar band gap energy with pristine phosphorene .",
    "notwithstanding , the remarkably low energy defect 5:5:8s structure is found to have a calculated @xmath12 of 2.03ev  somewhat unexpectedly wider than that of defect - free phosphorene .",
    "we rationalize the increase in the @xmath12 to the newly formed localized defect states near the valence band edge , as seen in fig.[figure5]c , as a direct consequence of the structural modifications and atomic rearrangements along the defect fault lines .    as can be seen from tab.[table1 ]",
    ", the metallic line defect structures do tend to have a slightly higher line defect formation energy than that of the semiconducting ones . at a first glance",
    ", these low energy line defects in single - layered phosphorene may provide a clue into the possibility of modulating the electronic properties by carefully engineering these line defects for new optoelectronic nanodevices .",
    "e / @xmath32 , for both the ( a ) conduction band and the ( b ) valence band edges.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    to further understand the origin of the newly formed defect states near the conduction band minimum and the valence band maximum , we plot the partial electron densities of the ultra - low energy line defect 5:5:8s structure in figs.[figure5]a and [ figure5]b , respectively . comparing to pristine phosphorene where each p atom forms covalent bonds with three neighboring p atoms via the @xmath33 electrons ,",
    "the overall chemical bonding character of this defect structure is follows the similar inter - mixing of the p @xmath33 orbitals .    specifically , near the conduction band edge ( cf .",
    "fig.[figure5]a ) , the partial electron density is found to be largely located between the p atoms located in the same plane ( i.e. along the  _ xy _ \" direction ) and a @xmath34-like orbital character at the p - p dimer along the fault line . however , near the valence band edge ( cf .",
    "fig.[figure5]b ) , the partial electron density is largely confined between the p atoms in different planes ( i.e. along the  _ z _ \" direction ) with a @xmath35-like bond forming between the p atoms in the p - p dimer parallel to the fault line .",
    "it is known that controlling the relative positions of the band edges ( with respect to the fermi level of the metal contact ) is crucial to effectively design and tailor the electronic properties in nanoscale fet devices .",
    "recently , it was found that varying the number of phosphorene layers in face - contact with various metal electrodes drastically modulates the position of the valence band maximum and thus modifies the schottky barrier height.@xcite to compare , we calculate the corresponding work functions of the fault line defect structures and align their band edges with respect to the vacuum level , as shown in fig.[figure6 ] .",
    "next , we benchmark the relative band edge positions with the work functions of various commonly - used metal contacts ( as obtained from refs . ) .",
    "in particular , the low - energy line defect 5:5:8s is found to shift valence band edge to lower energies by almost 0.5ev , as compared to that of pristine phosphorene . on the other hand ,",
    "the next low - energy line defect 5:5:8 t moves the conduction band edge to higher energies , and thus slightly broadens energy band gap . along these lines , by carefully applying line defect engineering in phosphorene , the generation of selected low - energy line defect structures might act as an effective ohmic contact with certain metals of high work function values such as tungsten , platinum , irridium , and palladium .",
    "this atomic - scale control directly allows one to extend the tunability of @xmath36-type phosphorene - based fet device performance .",
    "to conclude , by using the fault method , various structures of phosphorene with 1d fault line defects were designed and studied using first - principles dft calculations .",
    "we investigated the energetics and electronic structure of these fault line defects , and identified new low - energy fault line defects ( i.e. even much lower fault defect formation energy when compared to those found on graphene and @xmath1-bn ) .",
    "we also showed how these low - energy fault line defects could exhibit a range of electronic structure ( from metallic to semiconducting ) .",
    "the lowest fault line defect is termed 5:5:8s which comprises p - p dimer pairs along the fault line , and this new ultra - low energy defect structure ( with a formation energy of 0.01ev /  ) is bent at a small angle of @xmath9 with a energy band gap of 2.03ev .",
    "we propose that many , if not all , of these 1d line defects may co - exist during large - scale synthesis of polycrystalline 2d phosphorene , even under growth conditions .",
    "finally , our calculations extends our understanding of the impact of 1d fault line defects in @xmath36-type phosphorene - based fet nanodevices , going beyond that of the commonly studied point defects .",
