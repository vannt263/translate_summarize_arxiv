    "the existence of massive neutrinos  @xcite is a strong motivation for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) . as pointed out a long time ago by weinberg  @xcite , there is just one dimension - five operator relevant for neutrino masses in the context of the standard model : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the leptonic and higgs @xmath16 doublets . after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , the majorana mass of the neutrinos reads as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 gev is the sm higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) . the smallness of @xmath19 ev is thus understood by the  seesaw \" spirit if @xmath20 . assuming that the coupling @xmath21 of the dimension - five operator is the order of unity ,",
    "the observed neutrino masses imply that @xmath22 gev .",
    "the crucial issue is to understand the origin of this operator in a given extension of the sm in order to identify the dimensionless coupling @xmath21 and the mass scale @xmath23 at which the new physics enters .",
    "this dimension five operator thus guides us to look for extensions of standard model in which the neutrino masses are generated in a uv complete formalism .",
    "there are four simple renormalizable extensions of the standard model with minimal addition to generate neutrino majorana masses conceivable to agree with the experimental observations :    * _ type i seesaw mechanism _",
    "@xcite : one can add at least two fermionic singlets @xmath24 and the neutrino masses are @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the yukawa coupling and @xmath27 is the right - handed neutrino mass , which sets the new physics scale @xmath23 .",

    "@xcite : the higgs sector of the standard model is extended by adding an @xmath16 higgs triplet @xmath31 .",
    "the neutrino masses are @xmath32 , where @xmath12 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the neutral component of the triplet and @xmath33 is the yukawa coupling . with a doublet and triplet mixing via a dimensional parameter @xmath34",

    "the scale @xmath23 is replaced by @xmath37 , and a natural setting would be for @xmath38 and @xmath39 gev . * _ type iii seesaw mechanism _  @xcite : adding at least two extra matter fields in the adjoint representation of @xmath16 and with zero hypercharge , one can generate neutrino masses , @xmath40 .",

    "in particular , direct observations of the new heavy states responsible for the seesaw mechanisms would be more conclusive .",
    "while the seesaw spirit resides in the existence of a much higher scale @xmath20 , rendering the new states experimentally inaccessible in the foreseeable future , this may not be necessary the case . for recent studies where the seesaw mechanism could happen at a very low scale see  @xcite . a light @xmath16 triplet field responsible for type ii",
