    "<S> a shift of the vapor - liquid coexistence curves by the critical value of the reduced second virial coefficient yields striking data collapses to define master curves . </S>",
    "<S> this is observed for the mie , yukawa and square - well fluids of different attractive ranges . </S>",
    "<S> this modification of the extended corresponding - states law of noro and frenkel strongly improves the outcomes from the van der waals principle . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , this shifted extended principle makes the master curves from mie and yukawa potentials to be one on top of the other . </S>",
    "<S> the square - well potential forms two well defined master curves , each one corresponding to different effective critical exponents .    </S>",
    "<S> simple fluids lead to approximately the same compressibility factor when compared at the same reduced temperature and pressure , i.  e.  all these fluids deviate about the same degree from the ideal behavior . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the van der waals equation can be written in terms of reduced variables recasting into a substance independent form , when the reduction of variables is made with the corresponding critical values . </S>",
    "<S> this invariance can be seen as the principle of corresponding states , stating that two fluids with two equal reduced variables must have the same other reduced properties , and so their states are said to be _ </S>",
    "<S> this idea was early suggested by van der waals and 76 years later was proven to be precise for spherically symmetric pairwise additive potentials of the form @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the interparticle distance and @xmath2 and @xmath3 are constants  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , pairwise additive potentials which produce the same dimensionless @xmath4 function ( of the dimensionless argument @xmath5 ) by rescaling distance and energy must follow the corresponding states principle and are said to be _ </S>",
    "<S> conformal_. nowadays , reducing the pair potential with @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( being @xmath8 and @xmath9 the energy well depth and distance at which the potential crosses zero , respectively ) is a very common and convenient practice when performing computer simulations due to this principle  @xcite .    letting aside that many body real interactions are never strictly pairwise additive , seldom truly spherically symmetric , and </S>",
    "<S> that translational and rotational degrees of freedom may show significant quantization effects , the principle is not expected to work for pair potentials of different attractive ranges  @xcite ( in some cases , however , it does work at the vicinity of the critical point for some potentials of variable range  @xcite and even for bulk structural and dynamical properities when the potential can be written as a sum of exponential functions  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is simply because such potentials are not conformal . </S>",
    "<S> this kind of potentials is the rule more than the exception in the colloidal domain , since effective electrostatic and hamaker interactions are omnipresent and effective polymer - mediated depletion interactions are frequent , contributions showing a strong range dependence on the properties of both phases , dispersed and continuous  @xcite . with the aim of extending the applicability of the principle to potentials of variable attractive range , at least at the vicinity of the critical point , noro and frenkel  @xcite suggested using the reduced second virial coefficient , @xmath10 , as an additional independent variable . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in addition to the @xmath9 and @xmath8 usual quantities to rescale the interparticle potential , they incorporate @xmath10 as a measure of its effective attractive range . </S>",
    "<S> this was done in view that @xmath11 is almost constant for many different shapes of @xmath4 functions  @xcite(being @xmath12 the dimensionless critical temperature ; we are using the following units : @xmath13 for temperature , @xmath14 for density , @xmath15 for length , and @xmath16 for energy ) . in their proposal @xmath17 and so , given a particular @xmath4 , @xmath12 is fully determined without the need of a laboratory ( or computational ) experiment . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since master curves should exist for all reduced properties when represented against @xmath18 , one would obtain the desired reduced property value for any @xmath4 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , given @xmath4 , a single variable evaluated at its critical point would be sufficient to predict its values at other states . </S>",
    "<S> this is extremely useful for systems having a difficult to access critical point , such as those governed by strong short - ranged interactions ( most colloidal  @xcite and globular protein suspensions  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the assumption @xmath20 does not hold when considering from short to intermediate attractive ranges  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , @xmath11 diverges for the sticky limit of the attractive yukawa potential  @xcite , which has given rise to propose a modification  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , this assumption leads to imperfect collapses of the reduced properties when represented against @xmath18 ( see figure 13 of reference  @xcite and the inset at the right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that the direct comparison with the van der waals corresponding states framework for non conformal potentials is unfair , since in this last case two variables evaluated at the critical point are needed to make it work .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of this work is showing that , for spherically symmetric non conformal potentials from short to intermediate attractive range , the noro - frenkel extended framework works better than the original principle for the coexistence densities , when accounting for the fact that , in general , @xmath11 is a function of the attractive range . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we simply shift the reduced density coexistence curves against @xmath10 the quantity @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we express the reduced densities against @xmath22 , which forces all curves to coincide at the critical point as the van der waals principle does . </S>",
    "<S> this way of comparison between the original and the extended laws turns to be fair . </S>",
    "<S> it also makes the extended framework dependent of the critical temperature , though . </S>",
    "<S> we are setting @xmath23 to gain consistency with previous works  @xcite , but probably @xmath24 would be a better choice .    </S>",
    "<S> we are mostly taking advantage of the vast data series already published by several authors  @xcite and in previous works  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are , however , adding some extra results for the coexistence of the square - well and the attractive yukawa models at very short attractive ranges , where no data are available . </S>",
    "<S> these new data are given in tables at the end of this document . </S>",
    "<S> for this purpose we have carried out replica exchange monte carlo simulations expanding the isothermal - isocoric ensemble in temperature . </S>",
    "<S> temperatures are set below the critical point and following a geometrical decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this way acceptance rates turn similar between two adjacent replicas . </S>",
    "<S> the geometrical factor is set to obtain acceptance rates above @xmath25 in all cases ( they are close to @xmath26 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we are using rectangular parallelepiped cells with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , while considering a liquid slab at least @xmath29 wide along the @xmath30 axis . </S>",
    "<S> the vapor and liquid phases have similar volumes and their bulk densities are not affected by the presence of the two interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the initial configuration is set close to the vapor - liquid state , by randomly placing @xmath31 particles within the slab surrounded by vacuum . </S>",
    "<S> the center of mass is placed and kept along the simulation run at the cell center . </S>",
    "<S> verlet list are employed to improve performance . </S>",
    "<S> after a sufficiently large equilibration time , @xmath32 cycles ( consisting on @xmath31 trial displacements ) are considered to obtain the reported densities .    </S>",
    "<S> the square well potential reads @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the range of the attractive well . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained new data for @xmath35 , 1.12 , 1.15 , 1.20 , 1.25 , 1.30 ( table v of supplementary materials ) and took data for @xmath36 , 1.75 , 2.00 , 2.30 , 2.50 , 2.70 , and 3.0 from elsewhere  @xcite ( tables vi and vii of supplementary materials ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the other two potentials we are considering are the mie and yukawa expressions . </S>",
    "<S> they are given by @xmath37\\ ] ] and @xmath38 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the softness and attractive range for the mie expression are tuned by @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively , with @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> we have considered data for @xmath42 with @xmath43 , 10 , 12 , 18 , 20 , and 32  @xcite ( table i at the end of this document ) , and also for @xmath44 with @xmath45 , 9 , and 12  @xcite ( table ii ) . in the last expression @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> defines the attractive range of the yukawa potential . </S>",
    "<S> we are accounting from @xmath47 to 10 with increments of unity  @xcite , and for @xmath48 ( tables iii and iv ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we start the discussion of the results for the mie and yukawa potentials . </S>",
    "<S> results for the square - well interaction are given at the end of this work . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for doing so is that the shape of the square - well vapor - liquid coexistence curves is nearly cubic for @xmath49 and nearly quadratic for @xmath50  @xcite when presented as a temperature - density chart . in other words , the effective critical exponent @xmath51 is close to @xmath52 ( cubic ) or @xmath53 ( quadratic ) depending on @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this fact impedes producing a single master curve .    </S>",
    "<S> mie is also known as a generalized lennard jones potential since it turns into the lennard jones function when setting @xmath54 and @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it allows tuning the hardness of the core - core repulsion ( by setting @xmath39 ) independently of the attractive tail ( controlled by @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , mie presents no discontinuity and so it has not a well defined hard - core diameter . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , it is possible to define an effective diameter , @xmath55 , somewhere in between @xmath9 and the distance at which the potential is at its minimum , @xmath56  @xcite . for this potential we are taking data published by galliero _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and from previous work  @xcite . whenever the critical density and temperature were not available we obtain them by considering @xmath57 and from the law of rectilinear diameters . </S>",
    "<S> all these data and the corresponding @xmath10 and @xmath58 values are included in tables ( see tables at the end of this document ) . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned , @xmath59 is simply @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 dr^*,\\ ] ] @xmath63 dr^*,\\ ] ] @xmath64 for @xmath65 and @xmath66 otherwise  @xcite . as pointed out above , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath68 is the second virial coefficient of hard spheres with @xmath69 .    in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence is given as a @xmath70 chart as following the van der waals framework . here </S>",
    "<S> @xmath71 and @xmath72 , being @xmath73 the critical density . </S>",
    "<S> mie data correspond to black open symbols . as can be seen , there is a relatively good collapse of the data defining a master curve . </S>",
    "<S> this finding has been already pointed out by several authors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the data collapse is , however , improved when the coexistence is presented as a @xmath74 chart , as following the extended principle proposal and the @xmath75 shift . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in the right panel of the same figure ( black open symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of this master curve is wider close to the critical point since at this region the relative changes of @xmath58 are smaller than that of @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the relationship between @xmath58 and @xmath19 is not linear , thus the master curve does not fulfill the analogous of a rectilinear diameters law or a scaling law involving the critical exponent @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> we are also including the @xmath77 chart as an inset in the right panel to highlight the strong enhance of the data collapse when accounting for the @xmath75 shift .    </S>",
    "<S> data for the yukawa fluid are taken from galicia - pimentel _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and from previous works  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are also including the case for @xmath48 from our simulations . </S>",
    "<S> contrasting with the mie potential , the yukawa expression can only tune its attractive range while having a discontinuity which defines its hard core . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this case @xmath78 irrespective of @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> one would expect this difference to have an effect on the vapor - liquid coexistence , on the possible definition of a master curve , and on its possible shape . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the data collapse is not so good when the densities are represented in terms of the reduced temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is observed in the left panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , where red solid symbols correspond to the yukawa fluid . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the vapor - liquid coexistence gets wider as decreasing the attractive range . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the data are not scattered around a master curve but follow a defined trend . finally , and as expected , the average curve ( not shown ) does not coincide with the one obtained for the mie potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is wider close to the critical point and its extrapolation seems to cross the mie master curve .    </S>",
    "<S> a different picture arises when following the extended framework . </S>",
    "<S> the result is shown in the right panel of the same figure . here , not only the data clearly collapse but also the resulting master curve coincides with that obtained for the mie potential . </S>",
    "<S> this allows for a correspondence between different attractive ranges and different potentials types even for not very short attractive ranges ( for very short attractive ranges the shape details of the pair potential are expected to lose relevance  @xcite although this may not be the case  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it is possible the mapping among different potentials by matching @xmath58  @xcite , and to pick a model as a reference system ( usually the adhesive hard - sphere potential  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we split the liquid and vapor branches of the master curve to yield an analytic fit . </S>",
    "<S> the expression for the liquid branch is given by @xmath79 , which is strikingly simple . </S>",
    "<S> a mirror expression such as @xmath80 can only match the vapor branch close to the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 fits its general shape . </S>",
    "<S> note that a single computational experiment for @xmath84 to obtain @xmath85 and @xmath86 is enough to determine the whole binodal by using these expressions . </S>",
    "<S> that is , by equating @xmath87 and @xmath88 one gets @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> then from @xmath89 , @xmath12 is obtained . with this knowledge ( and </S>",
    "<S> function @xmath90 ) the complete binodal can be built . </S>",
    "<S> it will be interesting to test the predictions for other @xmath90 functions .    </S>",
    "<S> the square - well potential can be seen as a special case . </S>",
    "<S> although it is considered the simplest model capable of producing a vapor - liquid coexistence , its corresponding fluid behavior is far from simple . </S>",
    "<S> the energy flatness of the well and the second discontinuity at @xmath91 lead to a peculiar radial distribution function for the liquid phase  @xcite , which in turn is translated to all thermodynamic bulk properties . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it shows an oscillatory behavior for the critical density with @xmath34  @xcite and a steep change in the shape of the coexistence curve when transiting from @xmath92 to @xmath93  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this change is probably related to the fact that only the first coordination shell contributes to the total potential energy for @xmath49 and a second contributing shell appears at some point in between these two values  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the short attractive range suddenly turns into a not so short range , producing a jump of the effective critical exponent from @xmath94 to @xmath95 . in other words , the nearly cubic shape of the coexistence shift to something nearly quadratic </S>",
    "<S> this fact had raised questions on its belonging to the 3d ising universality class  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , @xmath11 also oscillates when plotted against @xmath34 , producing values significantly different from @xmath96 ( see references  @xcite and tables ) .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows the vapor - liquid coexistence for the square - well in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath58 in the left and right panels , respectively . here </S>",
    "<S> , we are presenting new coexistence data for very short attractive range cases ( @xmath97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> critical values well agree with those obtained from a mapping procedure of the grand canonical density distribution onto the universal ising model distribution  @xcite . for cases having @xmath98 , </S>",
    "<S> data were taken from previous work  @xcite , from del ro _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and from patel _ </S>",
    "<S> et  al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we are employing the effective exponents @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , to obtain the critical parameters ( all these data are given in tables ) . </S>",
    "<S> the short range results ( @xmath101 ) are given as black open symbols and red solid symbols are used for @xmath102 . </S>",
    "<S> short attractive range results seem to collapse when plotted against @xmath76 , whereas results for @xmath102 produce wider coexistences as increasing @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> nonetheless , the collapse for @xmath101 is clearly improved when using @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the results for @xmath102 do also yield a master curve when plotted against @xmath58 . in this case </S>",
    "<S> we are not including the @xmath103 chart since @xmath11 depends more strongly on the attractive range and so , the data collapse is poor . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the short range master curve for the square - well does not lie above the one found for mie and yukawa . </S>",
    "<S> the vapor branch is very similar , though ( the same expression with @xmath104 and @xmath105 produces a good match ) . </S>",
    "<S> the liquid do not match the simple shape @xmath106    in brief , we have compared the outcomes from the original van der waals framework with those from a slight modification of the noro - frenkel proposal for non conformal potentials of variable attractive range . </S>",
    "<S> this has been done for short and intermediate attractive ranges , but for the vapor - liquid coexistence only . </S>",
    "<S> results indicate that the extended framework works better than the original principle , once the corresponding shift of @xmath75 from the proposed value is accounted for . </S>",
    "<S> this is pointed out , at least , for the mie , yukawa , and square - well potentials . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shown how the mie and yukawa potentials yield the same master curve . </S>",
    "<S> for the square - well case , two well defined master curves were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it remains an open question how many master curves exist for simple fluids interacting for spherically symmetric pair potentials . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we have detected only three curves , but it may happen that new ones arise for some special shapes or ranges of the attractive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it is also questionable whether the shifted extended principle of the phase coexistence can be extended for patchy colloids  @xcite or liquid crystals where the interaction is anisotropic . </S>"
