    "were analyzed ( for both scaling relation ) .    to show that the observed high - frequency radio - spectrum of cas a is actually curved , the principal component analysis ( pca )",
    "was first applied ( babu & feigelson 1996 ) .",
    "the principal components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix .",

    "the second principal component has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal to the first one . in that sense , pca includes calculation of the highest data variability direction which can be used to detect departures from the pure power - law spectra ( linear fit in log - log scale ) .    in figure 1 , the results of pca on logarithmically transformed data ( @xmath11 ) from the first sample are presented .",

    "it can be fitted by the two power - laws , below and above 30 ghz ( excluding , of course , the low - frequency data influenced by the low - frequency cut - off ) .",
    "on the other hand , it is known that one of the repercussions of non - linear effects of particle acceleration is the curved particle spectrum which in turn gives rise to the curved synchrotron spectrum ( ellison & eichler 1984 ) . in that sense , it is more appropriate to represent radio - spectrum of young snrs with approximative relation that represents varying power - law of the form @xmath12}(\\nu ) = s_{[{\\rm jy}]}(1\\ \\!\\!\\mathrm{ghz})\\ \\nu_{[{\\rm ghz}]}^{-\\alpha + a\\log\\nu_{[{\\rm ghz}]}},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the standard synchrotron spectral index and @xmath14 is the parameter of spectral curvature which should be positive due to the non - linear behavior of dsa ( houck & allen 2006 ; vinyaikn 2014 and references therein ) .",
