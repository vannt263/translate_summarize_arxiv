    "self - propelled particle models ( spp s ) are a class of agent  based simulations that have been used over the last three decades to explore questions related to various kinds of collective motion in animals , including insect swarms , bird flocks and fish schools @xcite . in these models ,",
    "each individual in the ( finite ) population is represented by a particle that moves with constant speed in two or three - dimensional euclidean space or a 2-dimensional torus .",
    "all particles update their orientations according to a set of local averages of the current state of the configuration .",
    "these local averages are simplified representations of individual behaviors that depend on ` social interactions ' avoidance of collisions , attraction , and orientation alignment which result in the remarkable property of cohesive collective motion ; i.e. the particles move about in space , yet they appear to move as a single object , resembling the motion of real flocks @xcite .",
    "errors made by the individuals as they estimate these quantities are modeled by a random rotation of the output of this averaging procedure .",
    "+ more recently , spp models of flocking have been introduced in the context of collective decision - making to illuminate the question of how groups of agents achieve consensual decisions without the need of a central control @xcite .",
    "each of these decisions can be associated with a variety of collective states , which typically involve switching between mobile / immobile regimes @xcite , rotation or milling @xcite , motion with a directional bias @xcite , or a combination of these @xcite .",
    "a directional bias is relevant when critically important information , for instance the location of a resource , a predator or a migratory route , is available only to a fraction of the population @xcite .",
    "+ @xcite explored this situation using a modified version of earlier models of swarming @xcite , where the main innovation consisted of dividing the population into two types .",
    "the first of these , called ` nave ' , follow only the social rules mentioned earlier ( avoidance , attraction and alignment ) .",
    "the second kind , dubbed ` informed ' , also obey the social interactions of the nave individuals , but weigh the social output with an orientation bias along a single ` preferred ' direction , which in this study is identical for all informed individuals .",
    "this orientation bias can be regarded as a simple representation of access to privileged information .",
    "collective decision  making is understood in this context in terms of the ability of the informed sub  population to transfer their orientation bias to the whole group while simultaneously preserving group cohesion . + despite the recent explosion of spp models in the literature , our understanding of these systems still remains limited .",
    "central challenges are related to our ability to characterize efficiently and meaningfully the dynamics of each collective state , and critically , their dependence on the parameters of the individual  level model .",
    "we identify three distinct approaches to address this problem ; namely monte - carlo simulation , continuum models , and ` hybrid ' multi - scale approaches .",
    "+ the first ( the lagrangian approach ) is mainly computational and consists of moving with each individual particle .",
    "macroscopic summary statistics describing the various collective states are obtained from averages based on a large number of independent simulation runs , or a single time series when ergodicity is a reasonable assumption .",
    "these average quantities usually include the mean group velocity @xcite , the mean angular momentum @xcite , mean switching times between mobile / immobile states @xcite or the ` accuracy ' of the decision - making process @xcite .",
    "other state variables of interest link collective states to geometrical properties of the flock , like the group elongation @xcite or its aspect ratio @xcite .",
    "+ the second method ( the eulerian approach ) focuses on continuum models for the density and velocity fields .",
    "it has the advantage that in some cases analytical results linking the microscopic to the macroscopic can be rigorously derived .",
    "in addition to this , the numerical solution of the model for large or small population densities has the same computational cost , and the mechanisms that generate the collective patterns can often be clearly distinguished in the various terms in the model , which provides some degree of parsimony that approaches based solely on monte ",
    "carlo simulations can not emulate .",
    "continuum approximations have been used to approximate discrete spp models mainly to study collective motion that is not cohesive @xcite ; i.e. the population lives in a spatial arena with periodic or reflecting boundaries but does not form a single distinct group .",
    "instead , particles move about freely forming and dissolving groups of various sizes ( i.e. fission",
    " fusion dynamics ) , and collective motion is detected as a non  vanishing population average of the velocity .",
    "these continuum models are obtained through heuristic reasoning based on careful observation of system symmetries , or the invocation of conservation laws @xcite .",
    "+ although substantial progress has been made with eulerian ( continuum ) approaches , particularly for swarming microbial populations @xcite , there are still a number of issues that preclude their widespread use .",
    "first , the use of heuristics does not clarify the dependence of the macroscopic parameters on the individual ",
    "level model .",
    "although some continuum models have recently been derived formally from the individual  based model via a limiting process ( usually large population size ) , the theoretical progress is made at the expense of great simplifications which restrict strongly their biological relevance .",
    "for instance @xcite and @xcite each derived continuum models in the limit of large population sizes , but restricted the individual ",
    "level interactions to a single type of social interaction , specified via a potential function @xcite , or a velocity average @xcite .",
    "second , they usually require very large population sizes in order to be meaningful , which is problematic for models of flocking in groups involving tens or perhaps hundreds of individuals . in this situation",
    "the finiteness of the population size plays a fundamental role in observed transport properties ( e.g. the group tends to move more slowly as the population size increases ) @xcite .",
    "+ the third is the hybrid multiscale approach , which attempts to bridge monte ",
    "carlo simulations and continuum models .",
    "it is based on assuming the existence of a continuum model for some relevant coarse  grained state variable or ` reduction coordinate ' ; for instance non - linear advection  diffusion equations ( nade ) with density  dependent coefficients @xcite , or fokker ",
    "planck equations with a non - linear potential @xcite , which serves as a model template . the unknown fluxes and coefficients in the macroscopic template",
    "are _ estimated _ from a computational experiment , which usually consists of a single and relatively short simulation run of the microscopic model .",
    "these estimated quantities are substituted into the unknown terms in the macroscopic model , which is then analyzed by means of the appropriate suite of classical continuum methods , numerical or analytical .",
    "+ in this study , we use this latter approach to explore the ability of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite , and its associated continuum counterpart , the advection  diffusion equation with memory ( adem ) also known as the generalized master equation ( gme) as a model template for the coarse  grained dynamics of cohesive collective motion and collective decision  making in self  propelled particle models of swarms comprising a mixture of individuals that have preferential access to critical information the ` informed ' type and those who do not ( ` nave ' ) .",
    "the adem generalizes the classical advection  diffusion equation to a non  local  in  time transport model via the introduction of a ` memory ' , a time weighting function proportional to the particle s two  time velocity autocorrelation function .",
    "the adem is a useful model of anomalous transport that arises when the underlying random walk possesses a wide distribution of transition rates @xcite .",
    "the multiscale method we propose is based on coarse  graining the full spp configuration into a single ` meta  particle ' , that consists of the group elongation ( as a measure that the group remains cohesive ) and the mean group velocity and position .",
    "the various types of collective states displayed by the group can then be related to the transport properties of the meta ",
    "particle s random walk , under the assumption that the pdf of the transition density for the meta - particle s position follows an adem .",
    "+ we illustrate the method for the case of a 2dimensional spp model introduced earlier by @xcite for a single informed direction , but the approach is quite general in the sense that it can be applied to any individual  based model of movement for which the biologically meaningful coarse variables are the mean group position and velocity , and that the effective distribution of jump lengths at each transition event has finite moments of all orders . the multiscale approach for collective motion based on",
    "the adem complements _",
    "local_in  time multiscale approaches for a similar class of individual ",
    "level models explored earlier @xcite . for instance , the adem can predict correctly the transport properties even when the individual  level model has a strong alignment rule , which is precisely the main limitation of the otherwise successful method based on non - linear advection  diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "this results from temporal correlations in velocity fluctuations induced by the alignment rule that persist over macroscopically relevant time scales , a property that can not be captured by local  in  time markovian models , but can be dealt with via the introduction of a memory term .",
    "+ ctrw theory generalizes the classical random walk ( rw ) as a microscopic model better suited for problems in anomalous transport , which is usually detected when the mean squared displacement ( msd ) does not scale linearly with time over a wide range of time scales .",
    "the anomalous properties can frequently be attributed to the presence of a wide distribution of transition rates ( or also in the jump lengths ) , which leads to persistent temporal correlations in velocity fluctuations .",
    "it is the presence of time correlations in velocity that ultimately leads to anomalous transport @xcite .",
    "the variability in transition rates can be attributed in real systems to spatial disorder in the medium , as is the case in tracer transport in porous media @xcite .",
    "the presence of spatial disorder in the medium creates localized structures that can trap the particle for long periods of time , or force it to move ballistically by confining its motion along a corridor .",
    "the resulting particle motion consists of alternating bursts of ballistic motion , apparent brownian motion , and a stagnant phase where the particle moves very slowly , if at all .",
    "this resembles the dynamics of the group meta  particle in spp models of swarms , which typically consists of bursts of alignment in the particle orientations that lead to advective flights at the group level ( the slip phase ) , alternating with regimes of slow motion when the particles lose their alignment and the mean group velocity drops sharply ( the stick phase ) .",
    "the power of ctrw @xcite and effective medium theories of random motion in disordered media @xcite , lies in that the spatial inhomogeneities in the medium responsible for the anomalies in transport properties are not modeled explicitly . instead",
    ", their effect is summarized _ statistically _ in terms of the effective distributions of jump lengths and waiting times that define the random walk .",
    "the key innovation of ctrw theory is that the random walk does not proceed by fixed spatial and temporal increments , but these become instead random variables , defined by two probability densities , which are usually assumed independent in applications .",
    "the first is the distribution of jumps in space @xmath0 , which prescribes the length of the jumps between locations at each transition event .",
    "the second is a clock that regulates the times elapsed between transitions , known as the distribution of waiting times @xmath1 .",
    "a thorough discussion of modern ctrw theory and its role in models of anomalous transport can be found in a recent review by @xcite .",
    "+ it can be shown @xcite that when the distribution of jump lengths can be expanded in a taylor series and the distribution of waiting times is an arbitrary probability density function , the transition probability density @xmath2 for finding a particle around position @xmath3 at time @xmath4 given that it started at the origin at time zero , obeys a modified version of the advection ",

    "\\nonumber p ( { \\mathbf{x } } , 0^{+ } ) & = & \\delta ( { \\mathbf{x } } ) , ~~ { \\mathbf{x } } \\in { \\mathbb{r } } ^{2},~~t\\in { \\mathbb{r } } ^{+ }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the effective drift vector , @xmath7 the diffusivity tensor , and the colon operator is the inner tensor product @xmath8 the transport coefficients @xmath6 and @xmath7 are determined respectively by the ratio of the first two moments of the jump distribution to the mean of the waiting time distribution , or the median when @xmath9 does not have a finite mean @xcite .",
    "the memory function @xmath10 has two equivalent interpretations ; it is closely related to the distribution of waiting times @xcite , but it can also be shown to be proportional to the velocity time auto  correlation function of the moving particle @xcite .",
    "@xmath11 = 2d_{1 } m(\\tau),\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the velocity along the @xmath13 direction , @xmath14 is the diffusivity along @xmath13 and @xmath10 is the memory kernel that prescribes the decay of correlations ( see section [ sec : multiscale ] for additional details ) .",
    "this model constitutes the basis for effective medium theories of anomalous transport in disordered media , where the spatial disorder in the medium is replaced by an ordered model with memory of the form ( [ eq : adem1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "+ the stochastic dynamics of the meta  particle associated with the spp model of flocking explored here has a striking resemblance to that which motivated the development of the theory for anomalous transport in heterogenous media based on the ctrw and the adem . in spp models , the wide range of variability in transition rates can not be attributed to spatial disorder in the medium , but arises instead from stochasticity in the alternating ( slip / stick ) types of collective behavior . even though the source of variability is quite different",
    ", this does not seem to matter provided that transport can be modeled in terms of _ effective _ distributions of jump lengths and waiting times and their associated adem .",
    "our goal is to exploit this analogy to propose an adem as a continuum ` model template ' for the dynamics of the position pdf of a swarm centroid .",
    "the functional form of the memory and the transport parameters in the adem template can be estimated from a single mean group velocity time series obtained from a simulation run of the spp model .",
    "the resulting fitted model can be then used to explore the dependence of the collective behaviors on the parameters that determine the individual  level model , particularly the strength of the bias of the informed sub  population , the total population size , and the proportion of informed individuals .",
    "+ in the adem approach , the memory is the fundamental object that encodes all the transport coefficients , the various transport regimes and their characteristic timescales @xcite . when the spatial distribution of the disorder is known @xcite or the hamiltonian of the microscopic model @xcite , it is possible to derive the memory in ( [ eq : adem1 ] ) from the microscopic dynamics . in general",
    ", one has to resort to simulations or experiments and subsequent function fittings , in order to obtain the velocity auto",
    " correlation function .",
    "the non - linearities involved in the definition of the spp seem to preclude the derivation of the velocity time auto  correlation function rigorously from the microscopic swarm model .",
    "we find from simulations that the memory kernel along the informed direction for spp models can be very well fitted by two closely related functions .",
    "the first corresponds to a gamma density , @xmath15 which works well in swarms where there are no informed individuals present , but also when the proportion of informed individuals is small ( and relatively low values of the coupling strength ) .",
    "the initial power law decay in ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) leads to a sub ",
    "ballistic , super  diffusive transient detectable in the mean  squared displacement .",
    "this power law behavior has an exponential truncation at a characteristic time scale @xmath16 that establishes the onset of the asymptotic regime , which is dominated by diffusion in swarms with no informed individuals and a mixture of diffusion and advection ( with constant drift ) for groups that include informed individuals .",
    "we also find that the diffusion coefficient decreases with group size , and the time scale ( @xmath16 ) that determines the onset of the asymptotic regime increases with group size .",
    "+ the second , ` richer ' situation , arises in informed swarms for high values of the bias along the informed direction , where the early time super - diffusive transient is followed by a regime where correlations oscillate before reaching the asymptotic state , which is also classical advection  diffusion .",
    "this additional regime requires a modification of the memory kernel ( [ eq : gamma1 ] ) in order to capture these oscillations .",
    "we find that a mittag  leffler function @xmath17 with an exponential truncation @xcite , @xmath18\\,\\exp(-t/\\tau_a),\\ ] ] provides an excellent fit in this regime , at the cost of introducing two additional parameters ( the exponent @xmath19 and the time scale @xmath20 ) .",
    "we used these estimates together with the adem model in order to predict the behavior of the mean squared displacement ( msd ) , i.e. the second moment of the mean group position , which can be used to characterize the various types of collective behaviors and their characteristic time scales in terms of their effect on the meta ",
    "particle s transport properties .",
    "the functional forms themselves do not seem to change with group size , but only the parameters do .",
    "+ for the region of parameters where the group remains cohesive , we observed that there are two types of collective behavior that are shared by both nave ( no informed individuals present ) and informed groups .",
    "first , there is an anomalous super  diffusive transient at early times ( the scaling exponent in the mean squared displacement lies between one and two ) due to the prevalence of slip / stick dynamics over that domain of time scales .",
    "asymptotically , the msd scales linearly with time for nave groups ( diffusion  dominated ) , but shows a sharp transition to quadratic scaling ( advection  dominated ) for informed ones along the informed direction , which indicates that on average , informed swarms diffuse , but also move with constant velocity over the longer time scales .",
    "this transition from linear to quadratic scaling allows the detection of the time scale at which the informed sub - population manages to transfer its orientation bias to the whole group ; this time scale , or time to consensus , is a natural measure of the efficiency of the decision  making process .",
    "the magnitude of the drift , which depends on the degree of polarization of the particle orientations along the informed direction , is a straightforward macroscopic parameter for the degree of consensus .",
    "we also note that as the group size gets larger , the drift gets smaller for the same proportion of informed individuals and informed bias strength .",
    "finally , the diffusion coefficient along the informed direction can be interpreted as a measure of the precision of the collective decision  making process since it is a measure of the spread of an ensemble of swarm meta ",
    "particles when compared with that of nave configurations .",
    "+ the resulting adem fitted from swarm simulation time - series is self - consistent in the sense that transport parameters estimated from the memory via a kubo  green relationship @xcite coincide with those estimated from the moments of the jump and waiting time pdf s of the associated ctrw for the three group sizes explored ( @xmath21 ) , proportions of informed individuals , and strength of the bias along the preferred direction .",
    "we also discuss the phase diagrams for the transport coefficients estimated from this method , where we notice velocity  precision trade  offs : as the total group size gets larger , the decision  making becomes more precise at the expense of a slower mean group velocity .",
    "we also note that the time scale to consensus is invariant with respect to group size , and depends only on the proportion of informed individuals and the strength of the coupling along the informed direction .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : spp ] introduces a slightly modified version of the spp model with informed individuals of @xcite , where we removed the constraint on the maximum turning angle that an individual can make during a time step .",
    "we then define the set of coarse  grained variables of interest , namely the group elongation , the mean group position , and the mean group velocity which we called the meta  particle .",
    "simulation results are also shown , focusing on the mean squared displacement of the meta  particle as well as kernel density estimates of the probabilities of mean group speeds and orientations , finalizing with group elongation time series that detect when the group splits appart .",
    "these results are later used to define macroscopic measures of collective motion and collective decision  making in terms of the transport regimes shown in the msd .",
    "section [ sec : ctrw ] briefly reviews known results from the theory of continuous time random walks ( ctrw ) @xcite , and its relationship to the advection - diffusion equation with memoy ( adem ) @xcite that we use later as the macroscopic transport model for the transition density of the mean group position .",
    "section [ sec : multiscale ] assumes that the random walk followed by the group meta - particle evolves according to a ctrw , and discusses the procedure used to estimate the memory and the transport coefficients of the associated adem , from a single velocity time series obtained from a run of the individual - based model .",
    "we compare mean squared displacements obtained from ensemble averages over simulation runs with those predicted by the fitted adem for which show analytical results for the time to consensus .",
    "the method is used to carry out a systematic exploration of the dependence of the macroscopic parameters the diffusivity , the drift and the time to consensus on the microscopic ones of immediate biological relevance ; namely the relative proportion of informed individuals , the coupling strength , and the total population size .",

    "+ the local average in ( [ eq : updatepos ] ) comprises two groups of rules .",

    "this study suggests that both the transient and the asymptotic regimes of swarming populations with strong alignment and in the presence of an orientation bias can be concisely approximated by an advection  diffusion equation with memory .",
    "the presence of an orientation bias together with macroscopic bursts of alignment , alternating with an unpolarized phase , lead to quite non - trivial time correlations in the mean group velocity , which persist over macroscopically relevant time scales .",
    "these must be explicitly accounted for in order to capture accurately the macroscopic parameters that typify the various collective states together with their characteristic time scales .",
    "this observation is consistent with recent results by grnbaum _",
    "et al _ @xcite who found that local - in - time advection - diffusion equations even with density dependent coefficients could not fully capture the fluxes of individual - based models of swarming populations when alignment was an important contributor to the dynamics at the level of the individual particle .",
    "that study focused on looking at the fluxes of fission  fusion populations , without informed individuals , for various values of the density in order to try to find a functional form that fitted the dependence of the transport coefficients on the population density .",
    "we explored a much more limited range of population sizes , but instead looked in more detail at the _ temporal _ dependence of the mean squared displacement , and the various transport behaviors shown at each time scale .",
    "of course , both methods are not in opposition but complement each other . in the future , we would like to integrate both approaches in such a way that both the density  dependence and memory effects are included in a single transport model of swarming populations with alignment .",
    "+ we find that the mean group velocity increases as a power law of the coupling constant , and that the exponent of the power law decreases as the number of informed individuals increases .",
    "we also find in agreement with earlier work @xcite that the total group size has a dramatic impact in the collective transport properties .",
    "smaller groups tend to move with higher velocities , but at the expense of a higher diffusivity and thus less precise decisions .",
    "this may have important implications for evolutionary studies of simple models of collective  decision making , where there is presumably costs associated with recruiting informed individuals into the population , by having a relatively high value of the coupling constant and by making erroneous decisions ( vishwesha guttal _ et al _ , personal communication ) . if some value of the mean group velocity along the informed direction is optimal in a way that maximizes a measure of individual  level fitness , there are a number of possible ways to achieve it . one possible path is to have a small number of informed individuals , each with a relatively high coupling strength , while another is to have a larger number of informed individuals but with a much smaller coupling strength .",
    "a very rich trade  off space is likely to occur in this class of systems , particularly if one allows for variability in total population size .",
    "+ remarkably , the efficiency of collective decision  making , understood as the time scale at which an effective drift becomes detectable over the diffusive component of the meta  particle random walk , seems to be invariant with respect to group size .",
    "what seems to determine the efficiency is a combination of the fraction of informed individuals and the strength of the orientation bias .",
    "this arises from the fact that this quantity ultimately depends on the ratio @xmath146 and the characteristic time scale @xmath141 of the exponential decay in the memory ( [ eq : tauc_exp ] ) .",
    "+ the time velocity auto ",
    "correlation emerges from the adem approach as the key macroscopic summary statistic .",
    "it quantifies the relative contributions to macroscopic transport from each collective behavior , and allows the specification of their characteristic time scales .",
    "although the ability of time correlation functions to connect microscopic dynamics with observed macroscopic regimes has been known in non  equilibrium statistical physics for at least four decades since the seminal work of kubo @xcite , mori @xcite , green @xcite , zwanzig @xcite , montroll @xcite and kenkre @xcite , to our knowledge it is a relatively unexplored concept in movement and spatial ecology , where markovian models have dominated the scene @xcite , perhaps with the notable exception of correlated random walks @xcite .",
    "we would like to emphasize a subtle point though , which is that the temporal memory of the adem does not necessarily imply that the individual walker has information about the past in order to make movement decisions about the future . the memory arises naturally as a result of the ensemble average of a continuous time random walk in the presence of a wide range of transition rates .",
    "these can result from internal properties like an updating clock with a ` fat tail ' instead of an exponential one or external factors such as behavioral variability due to complicated social interactions or spatial structure in the landscape that results in slip / stick dynamics ; these can occur quite naturally if there are corridors with preferential directions of motion alternating with regions where movement can be described with brownian motion .",
    "we believe that this ecological interpretation of the time velocity auto  correlation function is likely to be useful not only to unravel the connections between individual  based models of movement and dispersal and their continuum approximations as we have seen in this study , but also for other areas of ecology where interdependencies between an individual organism s dispersal strategy , spatial heterogeneity in the landscape , and temporal variability in resource availability become intertwined in observed individual trajectories , particularly in the nascent field of movement ecology . + future work will be devoted to a generalization of the spp model to density - dependent asynchronous updating , in the sense that each of the social interactions is associated with an exponential clock that is parameterized by the local density , in a similar way to what is done in locally regulated models of plant population dynamics with spatial structure @xcite .",
    "given that the ctrw - adem can predict the the full density and not just the first moments , future work will be devoted to this issue in order to explore first passage times .",
    "we will also explore the situation when there are two conflicting preferential directions , where it remains to be seen whether the adem has the capability of capturing the bifurcations that have been detected in individual  based simulations @xcite .",
