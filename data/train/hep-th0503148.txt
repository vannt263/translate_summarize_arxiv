    "let us move to d - branes in the nw model and start from a cosmological region ( region @xmath22 ) . in this region , the background is time - dependent , and hence the energy is not conserved .",
    "d - branes in the coset theory are constructed to descend from maximally symmetric and symmetry breaking d - branes in @xmath25 wzw model , which are classified by ( twisted ) conjugacy classes @xcite .",
    "dbi actions are used to investigate the background geometry , especially near the singularities .",
    "we show that the classical solutions reproduce the group theoretical results , and we also examine the wave functions on the d - branes by making use of open string metrics @xcite .",
    "maximally symmetric and symmetry breaking d - branes in wzw models are classified by conjugacy classes and by twisted conjugacy classes , respectively @xcite . for these d - branes ,",
    "holomorphic and anti - holomorphic currents for bulk symmetry are related by linear equations at the worldsheet boundary .",
    "therefore , the corresponding d - branes should be invariant under the symmetry left , which are characterized by ( twisted ) conjugacy classes .",
    "d - branes in coset models can be constructed to descend from these d - branes in a systematic way , for example , as in @xcite , and for asymmetric cosets including the nw model as in @xcite .",
    "we obtain the geometry of d - branes using these methods as follows .",
    "we first focus on the conjugacy classes and the twisted conjugacy classes of @xmath49 and of @xmath50 . for @xmath49 part ,",
    "they are given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 and we denote them as a - type and b - type , respectively .",
    "the @xmath49 wzw model describes strings in @xmath63 , and the worldvolumes for a - branes are @xmath64 for @xmath65 , light - cone for @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath68 , and that for b - brane is @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "similarly , for @xmath50 part , the ( twisted ) conjugacy class is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 and we call them as a - type and b - type . the twist in the b - type is just an inner automorphism of @xmath50 in this case , and hence , in the @xmath50 wzw model , the b - brane is obtained by rotating the a - brane . however , in the parafermionic theory @xmath72 , it has been shown that gauging of @xmath73 part leads to two inequivalent types of d - branes @xcite .    in order to construct d - branes in the gauged wzw model",
    ", we have to take into account of the gauge symmetry . for the purpose , we sum up all the gauge orbits of the ( twisted ) conjugacy classes , project them into the gauge invariant space , and finally shift by an element of @xmath26 .",
    "this procedure is essentially the same as taking the product of conjugacy classes of @xmath25 and @xmath26 as in @xcite .",
    "let us call them as xy - type d - brane or xy - brane if they are obtained by descending from x(@xmath74a , b)-type for @xmath49 part and y(@xmath74a , b)-type for @xmath50 part .",
    "first , let us consider the case of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , namely the aa - brane .",
    "the conjugacy classes are shifted by the gauge transformation as @xmath77 summing up the orbit we obtain @xmath78 therefore the geometry of the d - brane is given by the hypersurface @xmath79 because of the symmetry along @xmath55 , there is a freedom to shift the total position by @xmath80 .",
    "note that we have to sum up @xmath81 with @xmath82 because of the residual gauge transformation @xcite , which makes the d - branes travelling in spiral orbits like d0-branes in misner space ( see appendix [ misner ] ) .",
    "we should notice that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , there is no brane for @xmath85 , instantons at @xmath86 for @xmath87 , branes in the time period @xmath88 for @xmath65 , and in all the time period @xmath89 for @xmath90 .",
    "similarly , there is no brane for @xmath91 , branes at @xmath92 for @xmath93 and lower dimensional branes at @xmath94 for @xmath95 . for @xmath96 and @xmath93 ,",
    "the hypersurface describes a d2-brane parametrized by @xmath97 and @xmath56 . for @xmath96 and @xmath98 ,",
    "the corresponding brane is d0-brane at @xmath99 and @xmath94 .",
    "notice that one more dimension is reduced because a component of metric @xmath35 is degenerated .",
    "next , let us move to the case of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , namely the ab - brane . in this case , we sum up the gauge transformation of ( twisted ) conjugacy classes @xmath102 which leads to the restriction of the worldvolume @xmath103 as before , there is no brane for @xmath104 , instantons at @xmath86 for @xmath87 , branes in @xmath105 for @xmath106 , and in all the time for @xmath90 . in the case of @xmath107",
    ", we have d3-branes for @xmath93 and d1-branes at @xmath108 for @xmath98 .",
    "this type of branes resemble to d1-branes in misner space explained in appendix [ misner ] , though d1-branes in misner space do not have the ends .",
    "third , we consider the case of @xmath109 and @xmath110 , namely the ba - brane . in this case",
    ", we sum up the gauge transformation of ( twisted ) conjugacy classes @xmath111 which leads to @xmath112 .",
    "notice that there is no restriction on the time @xmath1 contrary to the ab - brane case .",
    "we have d3-brane for @xmath93 and d1-brane at @xmath94 for @xmath98 .",
    "final case is @xmath109 and @xmath101 , namely the bb - brane .",
    "the hypersurface derived from the twisted conjugacy classes is @xmath113 again there is no restriction on the time @xmath1 .",
    "we have d2-brane satisfying for @xmath114 and d0-brane at @xmath115 and @xmath116 for @xmath98 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the non - trivial geometry of the nw model using the d - brane probes . in general , d - branes and strings feel the background geometry in different ways , which can be seen from their worldvolume actions .",
    "the low energy actions for the worldvolume theories on d - branes are of dbi - type , and d - brane metrics can be read from the effective actions . in this subsection , we construct dbi actions for the d - branes classified in the previous subsection , and see how d - branes feel the background , in particular , near the singularities .",
    "we also show that the classical solutions to the equations of motion are consistent with the geometry of d - branes obtained above .",
    "it is also important to examine how the non - trivial background affects open string spectra on the d - branes .",
    "a simple way to obtain the low energy spectra for open strings is to utilize open string metrics @xcite . because of non - trivial gauge flux on d - branes ,",
    "open strings feel the background metric in a modified way .",
    "we denote induced closed string metric on d - brane as @xmath117 and closed string coupling as @xmath118 .",
    "then , open string metric @xmath119 and open string coupling @xmath120 in a configuration with @xmath121 as induced @xmath59-field and @xmath122 as gauge flux on d - brane .",
    "we set for our convenience @xmath123 . ]",
    "are given by @xcite @xmath124 the low energy spectra for open strings can be read from the eigenfunctions of laplacians in terms of open string quantities : @xmath125 in this subsection , we only construct the laplacians and see their properties . more detailed analysis on wave functions is given in section [ wf ] .",
    "let us first examine the aa - type d0-brane with @xmath107 and @xmath98 ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "the dbi action in the static gauge is given by @xmath127 in the second expression , the induced metric diverges due to the singularity at @xmath128 .",
    "fortunately , the inverse of the string coupling vanishes at the point and cancels the singularity as in the last expression .",
    "therefore , one can say that the d0-brane metric does not include singularity at @xmath128 .",
    "this action has translational symmetry along @xmath55 direction , so the momentum conjugate to @xmath55 is a constant @xmath129 which can be rewritten as @xmath130 on the other hand , from the equation , one can deduce @xmath131 thus the aa - type d0-brane traveling at has an imaginary momentum @xmath132 , which means that the d - brane travels faster than the speed of light .",
    "in fact , the dbi action with the imaginary momentum is @xmath133 which is also imaginary for @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the d0-brane is tachyonic and is unphysical .. ] here , we do not claim that there is no solution for a d - brane with real momentum , but we just say that the solution does not correspond to one of the d - branes classified in the previous analysis .",
    "let us now move to aa - type d2-brane with the trajectory . in the static gauge ,",
    "the dbi action is given by @xmath135 we only excite @xmath136 and @xmath137 in the gauge field strength , then we have @xmath138 where @xmath139",
    ". therefore , we find @xmath140 the components of the field strength should satisfy the gauss constraints and @xmath141 should satisfy the equation of motion ; @xmath142 here we assume that @xmath143 satisfy the above constraints , then the dbi action is written in a very simple form @xmath144 notice that the original metric has singularities at @xmath128 and @xmath145 , but these singularities are cancelled by the contribution from the dilaton . using the ansatz ,",
    "the equations can be rearranged as @xmath146 in other words , the problem is replaced by solving the equation of motion with respect to the action @xmath147 .",
    "the equation of motion may reduce to @xmath148 or equivalently @xmath149 since we can show that @xmath150 with the ansatz , our choice of gauge fields satisfy the gauss constraints if we use the solution to the equations .",
    "the solution to is given by as expected if we assume @xmath151 , @xmath152 . and @xmath153 are chosen appropriately .",
    "] however , with this choice , the dbi action becomes @xmath154 the above action is purely imaginary because of the ranges of @xmath97 ( @xmath155 ) .",
    "this is again due to the tachyonic behavior of the d2-brane as in the d0-brane case , and we conclude that the aa - type d2-brane is also unphysical .",
    "again we start with a simpler case with @xmath98 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "the dbi action of the d - string wrapping along the @xmath157 plane is given by @xmath158 with @xmath159 , where the singularity at @xmath40 is cancelled as before .",
    "the gauss constraint leads to @xmath160 with a constant @xmath161 , which can also be written as @xmath162 if @xmath163 , then the condition @xmath164 is equivalent to @xmath83 , which is consistent with the previous results .",
    "however , the dbi action @xmath165 becomes imaginary also in this case .",
    "this implies that the gauge field strength on the brane is supercritical and the open strings on the brane are unstable @xcite .",
    "we can analyze ab - type d3-brane with @xmath166 in a similar way .",
    "we can show that the field strength @xmath167 satisfies the equations of motion . denoting @xmath168",
    "we find @xmath169 where @xmath170 .",
    "thus the dbi action is given by @xmath171 with @xmath172 since the solution to the equation @xmath173 gives a consistent choice , we can set @xmath174 using this field strength , the dbi action is written as @xmath175 at this stage , the singularities at @xmath176 are also cancelled .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath177 and @xmath178 @xmath179 lead to the reduced equations @xmath180 with @xmath181 and @xmath182 being constants .",
    "these equations can be rewritten as @xmath183 if we set @xmath184 , then @xmath185 means @xmath186 , which is the same condition as . however , with the above choice of field strength , the dbi action reduces to @xmath187 which is purely imaginary in the region . therefore",
    ", we conclude that the ab - type d3-brane is unphysical because of the presence of supercritical gauge flux .      in the case of ba - type d1-brane ( @xmath98 ) ,",
    "the dbi action is given by @xmath188 where we set @xmath189 .",
    "the singularity at @xmath36 is cancelled as before .",
    "the gauss constraint leads to @xmath190 with a constant @xmath161 , and one can solve for @xmath191 as @xmath192 for all @xmath1 , @xmath193 is non - negative , and the dbi action on the d - string is given by @xmath194 which is real .",
    "therefore , one expects that the resulting d - brane is physical one , opposite to the previous cases .",
    "next let us consider ba - type d3-brane with general @xmath93 .",
    "we excite the following components of gauge field strength @xmath195 then the dbi action becomes @xmath196 with @xmath197 inserting @xmath198 , which satisfies @xmath199 , into the dbi action , we obtain @xmath200 as before , there is no singularity at @xmath176 in this action .",
    "the equations of motion for @xmath201 are given by @xmath202 hence we may have @xmath203 with constants @xmath181 and @xmath182 , or inversely @xmath204 if we set @xmath205 , and @xmath206 is not fixed uniquely in this way of analysis .",
    "we might be able to determine it by gauging the case of @xmath25 wzw model @xcite .",
    "] then the conditions @xmath207 and @xmath208 imply @xmath209 , which is the same as the condition obtained before . with the field strength ,",
    "the dbi action becomes @xmath210 it is real for @xmath209 , and hence the d3-brane in this case is physical .",
    "since we now obtain the physical d - brane , let us examine the spectrum for open strings on the d3-brane .    as we mentioned before , wave functions are given by the eigenfunctions of laplacian expressed in terms of open string quantities .",
    "the open string metric and the open string coupling with our configuration of gauge fields are computed by following and as @xmath211 with @xmath212 let us make the transformations @xmath213 and @xmath214 then the open string metric and the open string coupling become @xmath215 we should also note that the region of @xmath1 is restricted as @xmath216 .",
    "the laplacian in terms of open string metric can be written as @xmath217 in this expression , we can observe that not only the dbi action but also wave functions on the d - brane do not behave in a peculiar way at the singularities @xmath218 .",
    "we continue the analysis on the wave function in section [ wf ] .",
    "we can also see that the expression of laplacian is consistent with the boundary conditions of currents .",
    "if we denote @xmath219 and @xmath220 ( @xmath221 and @xmath222 ) @xmath223 as the holomorphic ( anti - holomorphic ) part of currents in @xmath224 and @xmath50 wzw models , then the boundary conditions in this case are given by @xmath225 at the boundary of worldsheet .",
    "the remaining symmetries generated by @xmath226 and @xmath227 correspond to the translations of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , which is consistent with the form of the laplacian .",
    "we should notice that the laplacian ( or its eigenfunction ) is quite simple even though the background metric is rather complicated .",
    "this is due to the coset construction .      for bb - type d0-brane ,",
    "dbi action becomes @xmath228 because of the condition @xmath229 .",
    "the momentum conjugate to @xmath56 is a constant of motion @xmath230 therefore @xmath231 which is consistent with the motion of d0-brane with @xmath232 .",
    "we can show that the dbi action @xmath233 is real and the corresponding d0-brane travels at a speed less than that of light .",
    "we should remark that even if the physical d0-brane is used as a probe , the singularity at @xmath234 does not appear in the d - brane metric as before .",
    "one might expect that the point particle feels the singularity more severely than string , but actually what we have shown is that the d0-brane feel the singularity in a milder way than string .",
    "bb - type d2-brane can be analyzed in a way similar to the aa - type d2-brane .",
    "here we only introduce non - trivial potential @xmath235 and also assume that the gauge field @xmath236 satisfies the equations of motion .",
    "then the dbi action becomes very simple form as @xmath237 as before , we can use this action to derive the equations of motion for @xmath56 , which reduce to @xmath238 we can also show that the gauge fields satisfy the gauss constraints from these equations . because the above equations can be rewritten as @xmath239 we can reproduce the geodesic of d2-brane if we assume @xmath240 , @xmath241 . the dbi action @xmath242 is real for @xmath243 , thus we conclude that the bb - type d2-brane is also physical .",
    "notice that the d - brane does not seem to feel the singularity at @xmath244 even for the physical d - brane with higher dimensionality .",
    "the open string metric and the open string coupling in this case are computed as @xmath245 where @xmath246 performing the transformations @xmath247 the open string metric and the string coupling become @xmath248 in terms of the redefined parameters , the laplacian can be written as @xmath249 it might be interesting to notice that the laplacians for ba - brane and for bb - brane are quite similar even though the open string metrics are rather different .",
    "this is again due to the coset construction .",
    "the boundary conditions for the currents in this case are @xmath250 and the remaining symmetries generated by @xmath226 and @xmath251 corresponds to the shift of @xmath55 .",
    "this is again consistent with the form of the laplacian .",
    "the whisker regions contain ctcs , and they are usually regarded as sources of pathologies .",
    "however , since the nappi - witten model is constructed as a gauged wzw model , it seems natural to think that the model describes a consistent background . a famous example with non - trivial ctc is gdel universe @xcite , and recently there are several studies , e.g. , in @xcite regarding the properties of ctcs in superstring backgrounds of gdel type . in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite studied the regions including ctcs by using a d - brane wrapping the ctc as a probe . in this section",
    ", we investigate the whisker regions ( region 1 and region @xmath24 ) by using d - branes as probes with a special care on ctcs and related pathologies .",
    "in particular , we examine wave functions on d - branes wrapping the ctcs .",
    "the geometry of d - branes can be read off from the conjugacy classes and twisted ones of @xmath49 and @xmath50 as in region ii . in region 1 , the @xmath49 part is changed to @xmath252 but the @xmath50 part is the same as and .",
    "the ( twisted ) conjugacy class of @xmath49 in region @xmath24 is @xmath253 and that of @xmath50 is @xmath254 because of the shift in @xmath255 .",
    "as before , we obtain the geometry of d - branes in the coset theory by summing over the gauge orbit of the above ( twisted ) conjugacy classes , projecting into the gauge invariant space , and shifting by @xmath26 .",
    "let us now consider the brane trajectory in region 1 .",
    "following the analysis of region ii , we can see that aa - branes are described by the hypersurface @xmath256 as we mentioned before , the time coordinate is either @xmath55 or @xmath56 in the whisker regions , so we use @xmath257 as the coordinates of the worldvolume of the brane .",
    "suppose @xmath258 , then we have d2-brane for @xmath93 and d0-brane at @xmath259 for @xmath98 . for @xmath66",
    ", we have lower dimensional d - branes .",
    "if we regard @xmath55 as the time coordinate , then the d2-brane behaves in a way similar to d0-brane in a whisker region of misner space ( see appendix [ misner ] ) .",
    "now that @xmath56 does not depend on the other coordinates in , the d2-brane wraps the ctc in the region where @xmath56 takes the role of time .",
    "similarly , we can see that ab - brane has the worldvolume bounded by @xmath260 therefore we have d3-brane for @xmath68 and @xmath93 , d2-instanton at @xmath36 labeled by @xmath261 for @xmath66 and @xmath93 , d1-brane at @xmath108 labeled by @xmath262 for @xmath68 and @xmath263 . since @xmath43",
    "are independent on the other coordinates in , the worldvolume of the d3-brane includes ctc everywhere in the region .",

    ", the bb - type d2-brane includes ctc on it in the region where @xmath55 is regarded as the time .",
    "the region @xmath24 can be analyzed in a similar way .",
    "aa - brane is described by the hypersurface @xmath271 so we have d2-brane for @xmath93 and d0-brane for @xmath98 . for ab - brane , we have d3-brane in the region where @xmath209 for @xmath114 and d1-brane at @xmath94 for @xmath98 . for ba - brane",
    ", we have d3-brane in the region where @xmath272 for @xmath114 and d1-brane at @xmath273 for @xmath98 .",
    "similarly one can show that for bb - brane there is d2-brane at the hypersurface @xmath274 for @xmath114 and d0-brane for @xmath98 .",
    "note that for all the branes @xmath1 runs up to infinity ( @xmath275 ) , where the hypersurface may take the role of boundary of ads space @xcite .",
    "other properties , such as the similarity with the branes in misner space and the inclusion of ctc , are very similar to those of region 1 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous subsection , d - branes in region 1 extend up to finite @xmath1 , but d - branes in region 2 extend all the way to the `` boundary '' at @xmath275 .",
    "it is natural to expect that these two types of d - branes are qualitatively different . in this section",
    ", we construct dbi actions for effective theories on d - branes in region 1 and study the wave functions on them as in the previous section .",
    "let us first examine the d0-brane with @xmath68 and @xmath276 , namely with @xmath277 . in this case ,",
    "the @xmath38 component of the metric is negative , so we set @xmath55 to be the time - coordinate of the worldvolume , as a gauge choice .",
    "then the dbi action of the d0-brane is given by @xmath278 where we denote @xmath279 .",
    "the singularity of the metric at @xmath36 is once again cancelled with the inverse of the string coupling .",
    "since the metric does not depend on the time @xmath55 , the energy is a constant @xmath280 this equation can be rewritten as @xmath281 which is consistent with the geometry if we set @xmath282 .",
    "the dbi action with the above choice is given by @xmath283 notice that the action is real , and hence the d - brane should be physical .",
    "next , we analyze the d2-brane of this type .",
    "we set the worldvolume coordinates as @xmath284 such that one of them behaves like time - coordinate .",
    "the dbi action is now written as @xmath285 let us excite only @xmath286 , then we obtain @xmath287 where we denote @xmath288 and @xmath289 .",
    "now we have @xmath290 in order to find classical configuration , we can utilize the gauss constraints and the conservation of the energy momentum tensor : @xmath291 where the energy momentum tensor is defined as @xmath292 @xmath293    once we assume that @xmath294 , the dbi action takes a simpler form @xmath295 where @xmath296 for @xmath297 and @xmath298 for @xmath299 . with the above choice of @xmath122 @xmath300 , the gauss constraint leads to @xmath301 which can be rewritten as @xmath302 with a constant @xmath303 .",
    "therefore , @xmath304 satisfies the gauss constraint if @xmath1 satisfies .",
    "the energy momentum tensor with @xmath294 is given by @xmath305 thus the configuration with @xmath306 or @xmath307 satisfies the conservation of the energy momentum tensor .",
    "note that if we assign @xmath308 and @xmath309 , then the solution to and is indeed , which was obtained by utilizing the conjugacy classes .",
    "the dbi action with these fields becomes @xmath310 which is real for @xmath297 and imaginary for @xmath311 .",
    "therefore , the condition for the d - brane to be physical is changed across the line @xmath312 . as mentioned before",
    ", the time and space coordinates @xmath313 and @xmath56 are exchanged across the line @xmath312 , so the change of physicalness is natural from the bulk viewpoint .",
    "however , in the dbi action , the singularity from the metric is canceled with the divergence of the string coupling , and only the sign is left .",
    "thus , those who live on the brane might feel strangely the existence of the domain wall at @xmath312 . for the physical region @xmath297 , @xmath55 serves as a time - coordinate , and hence ctc is not included on the brane .",
    "as we will see below , this happens not for all the branes .",
    "let us move to the equations for wave functions on the d2-brane , where only the physical region @xmath297 is considered .",

    "<S> the aim of this paper is to investigate by d - brane probes whether there are pathologies associated with the cosmological singularities and the closed time - like curves . </S>",
    "<S> we first classify d - branes in a group theoretical way , and then examine dbi actions for effective theories on the d - branes . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that d - brane metric from the dbi action does not include singularities , and wave functions on the d - branes are well behaved even in the presence of closed time - like curves .    </S>",
