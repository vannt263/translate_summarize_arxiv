    "all the models produce a dip in @xmath2 at the line center .",
    "earlier studies have shown that such a central dip in @xmath2 is generally due to the effects of prd ( see for example , figure  3 of , and figure  6 of ) . the main contribution to",

    "the central dip is formed mainly through contributions from the even isotopes ( see figure  5 of * ? ? ?",
    ". however the profiles computed using only crd do not show any central dip .",
    "it is generally known that @xmath2 profiles computed with crd and prd in realistic model atmospheres differ not only in the line wings but also in the line core .",
    "this is contrary to the behaviour expected of @xmath2 profiles computed in isothermal atmospheres , where they nearly match .",
    "a study of the mechanisms that cause the differences in the line core , in the case of realistic atmospheres , would be taken up in a forthcoming publication .",
    "show that the magnitude of the @xmath2 central dip is strongly dependent on the choice of atmospheric parameters .",
    "the central dip becomes shallower for cooler models .",
    "this behavior is also evident from our figure  [ smitha - no - fit ] .",
    "such dips in @xmath2 are common in line profile modeling with prd , and are often smoothed out by applying instrumental and macro - turbulent broadening .",
    "the profiles presented in figure  [ smitha - no - fit ] have already been smeared with a gaussian function having a full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of 70  m .",
    "though it is possible to smoothen out the dip by increasing the smearwidth , it will suppress the side peaks which are due to the odd isotopes and also disturbs the fit to the intensity profile . a smearwidth value of 70  m  has been chosen by us to optimize the fit and it is also consistent with what we expect based on the observing parameters and turbulence in the chromosphere .",
    "since all the standard model atmospheres failed to provide a fit , we had to modify the temperature structure of the falx model to get a new much cooler model .",
    "this modified model is called the @xmath84 and the details of its construction are given in @xcite .",
    "this new model atmosphere succeeds in fitting both the intensity and the linear polarization profiles .",
    "the fit to the @xmath2 profile is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ smitha - fit ] .",
    "the theoretical profile in this figure also includes the contribution from the spectrograph stray light which is 4% of the continuum intensity .",
    "this is done to mimic the observed profiles which contain the contribution from stray light .",
    "finally , the effect of microturbulent magnetic field with a strength of 2  g is included to obtain a good @xmath2 fit at the line center .",
    "profiles using the @xmath84 model atmosphere and also the comparison between profiles computed with prd and crd.,width=377 ]    the ba  ii d@xmath0 4554    line is a resonance line and is strongly influenced by the effects of prd .",
    "hence it is very important to take account of the prd effects while modeling .",
    "its importance in case of the even isotopes of ba  ii is demonstrated in . in the right panel of figure",
    "[ smitha - fit ] , we present a comparison between the observed and the theoretical @xmath2 profiles based on crd alone ( dotted line ) and on full prd ( dashed line ) for the @xmath85 model .",
    "the intensity profile can be fitted well using either prd or crd ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the polarization profile can not be fitted with crd alone .",

    "the right panel of this figure shows the clv of the theoretical @xmath2 profiles computed using the @xmath84 model atmosphere .",
    "as seen from the right panel , the newly constructed model atmosphere , though successfully fits the observed profiles for @xmath80 , fails to fit the observations for @xmath86 .",
    "in fact for @xmath86 , we again obtain a central dip instead of a peak in the @xmath2 profiles . the central dip becomes deeper as @xmath87 .",
    "this behavior was noticed also for the case of na  i d@xmath0 by .",
    "thus the modification in the temperature structure of the falx model atmosphere , presented in @xcite and in this paper , helps only for @xmath80 .",

    "also , we extend the same to model the observed clv of the @xmath2 profiles . to model the clv profiles , we use the same approach that was used in @xcite .",
    "we find that some of the standard model atmospheres like the falf , falc , fala , and falx fail to reproduce the central peak , and instead give a central dip which is mainly due to prd effects . also , this central dip is quite sensitive to the temperature structure of the model atmosphere . by slightly modifying the temperature of the standard falx model atmosphere ,",
    "we obtain a fit to both @xmath81 and @xmath2 profiles .",
    "this new model is called the @xmath84 .",
    "however this new model successfully fits the observations only for @xmath80 and fails at other limb distances .",
    "hence within the sample of the model atmospheres tested by us , no single one dimensional , single component model atmosphere succeeds in reproducing the observed @xmath2 profiles at all limb distances .",
    "this possibly indicates that multi - dimensional transfer effects are required to model the clv observations of this line .",
    "finally , we show that since the ba  ii d@xmath0 is a strong resonance line , it has damping wings that are governed by prd .",
    "it is therefore necessary to take full account of prd in order to correctly model the @xmath2 profile .",
