    "each three - photon pathway is either on - resonance or near - resonance with the intermediate state @xmath4 , with a corresponding detuning @xmath44 . a resonance - mediated ( 2 + 1 ) three - photon pathway corresponding to a detuning @xmath44 involves a non - resonant absorption of two photons to a total excitation energy of @xmath45 and the absorption of a third photon of frequency @xmath46 .",

    "the double - step phase patterns are additionally included here since , as explained below , they all induce the same maximal on - resonant component @xmath79 , while each of them induces a different near - resonant component @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath75 amplitude of all the phase steps , i.e. , generally @xmath81 0 or @xmath75 , implies that the field @xmath57 is always a real ( positive or negative ) quantity for any @xmath23 .",

    "the constructive nature of these interferences generally leads to the dominance of the corresponding near - resonant component @xmath143 over the on - resonant component @xmath145 for all bandwidth values , except for values around 15  nm . there , both the near - resonant and on - resonant components are very small and have a value close to zero .",
    "this is indeed the behavior of the near - resonant vs.  on - resonant components shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) .    for analyzing the bandwidth dependence of the absorption relative to the tl pulse , i.e. , the graph of @xmath146 vs.  @xmath101 shown in fig .  [ fig4](a )",
    "( solid line ) , one also needs to account for the case of the tl pulse analyzed in the previous section . at a very narrow bandwidth",
    "the phase shaping is expected to have very small or no effect at all on the absorption relative to the ( unshaped ) tl pulse , as is indeed reflected in the value @xmath147 for 2-nm bandwidth .",
    "then , as the bandwidth increases the pulse shaping starts to have an effect .",
    "for the 5-nm bandwidth , where there is a local peak of @xmath148 , one obtains that : ( i ) @xmath149 since @xmath150 [ see fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) ] , and ( ii ) @xmath151 due to the different nature of the interferences between positively- and negatively - detuned excitation pathways for the two pulses .",
    "hence , @xmath152 for 5-nm bandwidth .",
    "then , as the bandwidth increases from 5  nm to 9  nm , the value of @xmath146 decrease to a value around 1 .",
    "this decrease results mainly from the stronger increase of @xmath153 relative to @xmath144 for @xmath48 and @xmath154 [ see fig .  [",
    "fig5](b ) ] . then , as the bandwidth further increases to around 15 nm , the value of @xmath146 approach zero since @xmath155 and @xmath156 , resulting from @xmath157 and @xmath158 for @xmath141 [ see above and fig .",
    "[ fig5](c ) ] .",
    "actually , with 14.6-nm bandwidth the on - resonant component is completely zeroing out and to a very good approximation the corresponding shaped pulse is a three - photon dark pulse .",
    "further increase of the bandwidth beyond 15  nm , leads to a continuous increase in the value of @xmath146 .",
    "for example , at 40-nm bandwidth it reaches a value of 4.1 . following the above analysis and as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d1)-(e1 ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4](a ) , for bandwidth values beyond 15  nm , the value of @xmath146 is actually determined only by the dominant near - resonant shaped - pulse term @xmath159 and the on - resonant tl term @xmath160 , i.e. , @xmath161 . for large bandwidth @xmath101 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 for small @xmath44 . hence : ( i ) for the tl pulse : since @xmath164 , based on eq .",

    "@xmath101 leads to a continuous increase in the value of @xmath146 as @xmath170 .",
    "this is indeed seen in the graph shown in fig .",

    "last we consider the case of the shaped pulse with the phase pattern of a double @xmath75 step with @xmath109 ( solid thin black lines in fig .",

    "with such a phase pattern , as with any of the double - step phase patterns , the phase associated with all the two - photon pathways of total two - photon transition frequency @xmath171 is zero , since @xmath172 for any @xmath23 ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "so , fully constructive interferences are induced between all these two - photon pathways , as is the case with the transform - limited pulse .",
    "hence , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , with any spectral bandwidth , @xmath173 , which , as explained above , is the maximal possible value ( here , at @xmath48 ) for a given spectrum .",

    "the field @xmath175 has different sign for @xmath118 when @xmath117 is small , which is in full correlation with the sign of @xmath51 for small @xmath118 .",
    "this is similar to the case of the single - step phase pattern of @xmath111 discussed above .",
    "thus , also here , the relative sign between the amplitudes @xmath176 contributed to the @xmath52-integration of @xmath177 from @xmath118 is determined only by @xmath178 .",
    "the fact that @xmath179 ( i.e. , for @xmath48 ) has the maximal possible value also implies that for small @xmath44 values @xmath178 is also very close to the maximal possible tl value , i.e. , @xmath180 , with a corresponding value that is a real positive one . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for any bandwidth , @xmath178 is of the same sign for small @xmath118 , i.e. , the interferences between negatively- and positively - detuned near - resonant pathways are constructive ones .",
    "similar to the single - step phase pattern discussed above , the constructive nature of these interferences leads to the dominance of the corresponding near - resonant component @xmath177 over the on - resonant component @xmath181 for all bandwidth values .",
    "this is indeed the behavior of the near - resonant vs.  on - resonant components shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath180 , while the nature of the near - resonant interferences is constructive to the pulse with the double - step phase pattern and destructive for the tl pulse , imply that @xmath182 .    the overall bandwidth dependence of @xmath183 shown in fig .  [ fig4](b ) ( solid line ) , can then be understood as follows : since @xmath184 and @xmath185 one obtains that @xmath186 for any bandwidth value .",
    "this is indeed what observed in fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) , i.e. , the corresponding three - photon absorption is always above the tl absorption .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the graph of @xmath183-vs.-@xmath101 is actually very similar to the single - step phase pattern case analyzed above , just with higher values due to the fact that @xmath179 is kept on its maximal value for any bandwidth . also here , for large bandwidth @xmath101 , following the above analysis for the present double - phase - step pulse and for the tl pulse , @xmath187 .",
    "also , @xmath162 and @xmath163 for small @xmath44 .",
    "so : ( i ) for the tl pulse : @xmath164 and thus @xmath165 , where @xmath166 is the tl proportionality constant .",
    "( ii ) for the shaped pulse of @xmath109 : @xmath188 , where @xmath189 and @xmath190 are constants for the specific double - phase - step pulse shape .",
    "so , @xmath183 behaves asymptotically as @xmath191 .",
    "the constants @xmath192 and @xmath193 are , respectively , larger than the @xmath194 and @xmath195 constants of the single - step phase pattern of @xmath111 , due to the larger near - resonant component induced by the double - step phase pattern .",
    "hence , for any given bandwidth , the resonance - mediated ( 2 + 1 ) three - photon absorption induced by the shaped pulse with double - step phase pattern of @xmath109 is higher than the absorption induced by the shaped pulse with single - step phase pattern of @xmath111 .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied in detail femtosecond phase control of atomic resonance - mediated ( 2 + 1 ) three - photon absorption , focusing on its dependence on the spectral bandwidth of the excitation pulse .",
    "the total absorption amplitude has contributions from a group of interfering three - photon pathways that are on resonant with the intermediate state and a group of interfering three - photon pathways that are near resonant with it . for a given pulse shape ,",
    "the ratio between the amplitude contributions from these two groups depends on the spectral excitation bandwidth .",
    "the nature of the three - photon absorption that is induced by a given shaped pulse is analyzed in a systematic and physically - intuitive way by decomposing it into a two - photon absorption , which is induced by all the possible two - photon pathways leading to various detunings from the intermediate state , followed by the absorption of a proper third photon .",
    "prominent among the results is our finding that with simple proper pulse shaping an increase in the excitation bandwidth leads to a corresponding increase in the enhancement of the three - photon absorption over the absorption induced by the ( unshaped ) transform - limited pulse .",
    "for example , here , 40-nm bandwidth leads to an order - of - magnitude enhancement over the transform - limited absorption .",
