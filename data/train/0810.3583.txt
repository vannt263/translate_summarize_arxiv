    "the standard model ( sm ) is a very predictive framework . given precise measurements of @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , the @xmath0 boson mass plays a central role , as it allows for both a sm cross check , confronting predictions of the @xmath0 and top quark masses  @xcite with measurements  @xcite , and limits on the sm higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "finally , constraints on the contributions of other heavy particles , like supersymmetric particles  @xcite can be obtained .",
    "the @xmath0 mass precision has continually improved with statistics , yielding the current world average of @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "further improvement will translate into more precise indirect predictions of the sm higgs mass .",
    "the simulated @xmath0 and @xmath1 boson signal and associated background samples used in this study are computed using the pythia general purpose event generator  @xcite , with photon radiation in @xmath0and @xmath1decays treated via an interface to photos  @xcite .",
    "the size of the expected samples are computed assuming the nlo @xmath0and @xmath1cross - sections , as obtained from resbos  @xcite , and simulated with complete simulation of the atlas detector using geant4  @xcite .    at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath0and @xmath1events can be detected and reconstructed in the @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 final states . in the following",
    ", the term lepton ( @xmath12 ) will refer to either an electron or muon .",
    "electrons are measured using the inner detector ( i d ) and electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) .",
    "they are reconstructed and identified with an efficiency of about 65% , while rejecting background from jets up to one part in @xmath13 .",
    "the transition region from barrel to endcap in the emc ( @xmath14 ) is not used . for muons ,",
    "the i d is used together with the muon spectrometer with a reconstruction efficiency of about 95% .",
    "backgrounds are less than for electrons , and diminished using isolation .",
    "the transverse momentum of the neutrino is inferred from the transverse energy imbalance as determined by the calorimeters .",
    "the relative energy resolution is typically 1.5% for electrons and 2.0% for muons , while the missing transverse momentum ( met ) has a resolution of 15 - 25%  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0signal is extracted by selecting events with one isolated lepton ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) along with significant met due to the undetected neutrino ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "these selections have a total efficiency ( trigger and selection ) of about 20% ( 40% ) for the electron ( muon ) channel , providing a sample of about @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) events .",
    "the backgrounds are at the 3% ( 6% ) percent level .",
    "likewise , the @xmath1signal is required to have two opposite sign leptons ( @xmath15 and @xmath20 ) .",
    "the efficiency of this selection is about 10% ( 30% ) in the electron ( muon ) channel , yielding samples of about @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) events .",
