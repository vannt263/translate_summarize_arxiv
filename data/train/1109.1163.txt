    "a particular challenge in the development of analytic methods is the inclusion of the long - ranged , and for more concentrated systems non - pairwise additive , hydrodynamic interactions ( his ) , which essentially influence the dynamic properties in their short - time behavior . due to their complexity",

    "the account of many - body his in analytic methods is only possible by introducing approximations . for this reason ,",
    "it is of prime importance to assess the overall accuracy of analytic methods , by the comparison to precise benchmark results obtained from computationally elaborate dynamic computer simulations .    in this paper",

    "the first method , referred to as the pairwise additive ( pa ) scheme , uses exact two - body hydrodynamic mobility tensors including the lubrication part , but it fully disregards three - body and higher - order hydrodynamic contributions . the second scheme is a hybrid method combing the virtues of beenakker and mazur s so - called @xmath4-scheme approach for @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite , with those of the pa scheme , and precise known results for the special case of neutral hard spheres .",
    "the @xmath4 scheme accounts for many - body hi contributions in an approximate way .",
    "we present the two methods in a self - contained way , allowing for their easy implementation .",
    "both methods require the static structure factor , @xmath5 , or equivalently the radial distribution function ( rdf ) @xmath6 , as the only input .",
    "we calculate this static input using our recently developed analytic modified penetrating - background corrected rescaled mean spherical approximation ( mpb - rmsa ) scheme @xcite , which allows for a fast and accurate evaluation of the hsy pair - structure functions .",
    "the accuracy of both methods for calculating @xmath0 and @xmath1 is assessed through comparison with a large number of simulation results , representative of the full fluid - state regime , which we have obtained using accelerated stokesian dynamics simulations .",
