    "<S> we present a multi - wavelength analysis of five submillimeter sources ( @xmath0 = 0.542.02 mjy ) that were detected during our 1.1-mm - deep continuum survey in the sxdf - uds - candels field ( 2 arcmin@xmath1 , 1@xmath2 = 0.055 mjy beam@xmath3 ) using the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two brightest sources correspond to a known single - dish ( aztec ) selected bright submillimeter galaxy ( smg ) , whereas the remaining three are faint smgs newly uncovered by alma . </S>",
    "<S> if we exclude the two brightest sources , the contribution of the alma - detected faint smgs to the infrared extragalactic background light is estimated to be @xmath4 jy deg@xmath5 , which corresponds to @xmath6 of the infrared extragalactic background light . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that their contribution to the infrared extragalactic background light is as large as that of bright smgs . </S>",
    "<S> we identified multi - wavelength counterparts of the five alma sources . </S>",
    "<S> one of the sources ( sxdf - alma3 ) is extremely faint in the optical to near - infrared region despite its infrared luminosity ( @xmath7 or sfr @xmath8 100 @xmath9 yr@xmath3 ) . by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) at the optical - to - near - infrared wavelengths of the remaining four alma sources </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained the photometric redshifts ( @xmath10 ) and stellar masses ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12@xmath13 , @xmath14@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we also derived their star formation rates ( sfrs ) and specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) as @xmath16@xmath17 yr@xmath3 and @xmath18@xmath19 gyr@xmath3 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values imply that they are main - sequence star - forming galaxies . </S>"
