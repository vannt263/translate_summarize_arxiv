    "_ chandra _  observations clearly demonstrate that there are not enough discrete sources with @xmath14  erg s@xmath4  to account for more than 10% the galactic ridge x - ray emission @xcite",
    ". however , the strengths of fe lines observed from the diffuse emission are similar to those observed from galactic x - ray point sources , which suggests that they could be one and the same ( wang , gotthelf , & lang 2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , discrete yet extended sources could produce the spatial variations in the diffuse emission .",
    "several classes of extended features have recently been identified , including : regions of bright iron fluorescence that are ascribed to molecular clouds being illuminated by x - rays from a bright point source @xcite or bombarded by low - energy cosmic - ray electrons @xcite ; arcminute - scale features with hard spectra that resemble supernova shocks @xcite ; and x - ray counterparts to radio features that are thought to be magnetic filaments ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lu , wang , & lang 2003 ) . _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations are only beginning to establish how much flux faint point sources and discrete extended features contribute to the diffuse galactic x - ray emission .",
    "if the galactic ridge x - ray emission is truly diffuse , then it could be produced either by hot , @xmath15  k plasma or by cosmic - rays interacting with neutral material in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission is one of the most useful diagnostics of its origin .",
    "observations in the 0.510  kev band reveal lines from h - like and he - like ions of mg , si , s , and fe , which indicates that the diffuse emission can not originate from a plasma with a single temperature @xcite . as a result , several authors have modeled the diffuse emission as originating from two plasma components ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) : one with @xmath16  kev ( which we refer to here as the `` cool '' or `` soft '' component ) , and a second with @xmath17  kev ( which we refer to as `` hot '' or `` hard '' ) .",
    "the soft plasma is thought to be produced by supernova shock - waves @xcite , which are the largest source of energy for heating the ism @xcite .",
    "the origin of the @xmath7  kev component of the galactic ridge emission is far less certain .",
    "the temperature of the putative hot plasma is too high for it to be bound to the galactic disk , so that the energy required to sustain it could be equivalent to the release of kinetic energy from one supernova occurring every 30  years ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , supernovae are not observed to produce thermal plasma with @xmath18  kev , and there is no known alternative source in the galactic disk for that much energy . therefore , several alternative sources of the hot plasma have been proposed .",
    "one possibility is that the @xmath7 kev plasma is heated by magnetic reconnection in the ism , and subsequently confined to the galactic plane by a large - scale toroidal field @xcite .",
    "it is also possible that the hot diffuse x - ray emission is a low - energy extension of the emission with a power - law spectrum observed above 10  kev , which suggests that it may result from a non - thermal mechanism ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* but see lebrun  2004 ) .",
    "among the proposed mechanisms are charge - exchange interactions between cosmic ray ions and interstellar matter ( tanaka , miyaji , & hasinger 1999 ; valinia 2000 ) , bremsstrahlung radiation from cosmic - ray electrons or protons @xcite , and quasi - thermal emission from plasma that is continuously accelerated by supernova shocks propagating in the @xmath1  kev component of the ism @xcite .",
    "these non - thermal processes should produce line emission with energies and flux ratios that differ significantly from those expected from a plasma in thermal equilibrium .",
    "unfortunately , previous _",
    "observations were unable to determine the ionization state of the plasma unambiguously , because the spectrum was contaminated by an instrumental fe line between 67  kev .",
    "clearly , further study of the diffuse x - ray emission is important for understanding stellar life cycles , magnetic fields , and cosmic ray production in the galaxy . in this paper",

    "@xcite : ( 1 ) the long integration provides sufficiently large signal - to - noise ratio to study the spectrum of the diffuse emission from arcminute - scale sub - regions of the field , ( 2 ) the 05 angular resolution allows us to resolve the truly diffuse emission from filamentary features and point sources , and ( 3 ) the relative lack of instrumental lines , particularly between 67  kev , allows us to measure the ionization state of the diffuse emission with greater confidence .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  2.1",
    "we present images that provide an overview of the diffuse emission from the field . in section  2.2 ,",
    "we examine how the spectrum of the diffuse emission differs across the field . in section  2.3",

    "these are used in sections  3.2 and 3.3 to examine the likely origins of the diffuse emission . in section  3.4",
    ", we discuss the number of undetected point sources that may be present in the field .",
    "finally , in section  4 , we list the contributions of point sources , extended features , and diffuse emission to the x - ray luminosity of the galactic center .",
    "the inner 20 pc of the galaxy have been observed on twelve occasions as of june 2002 ( table  [ tab : obs ] ) using the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer imaging array ( acis - i ) aboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ @xcite .",
    "the acis - i is a set of four 1024-by-1024 pixel ccds , covering a field of view of 17  by 17 .",
    "when placed on - axis at the focal plane of the grazing - incidence x - ray mirrors , the imaging resolution is determined primarily by the pixel size of the ccds , 0492 .",
    "the ccds also measure the energies of incident photons , with a resolution of 50300 ev ( depending on photon energy and distance from the read - out node ) within a calibrated energy band of 0.58  kev .",
    "we reduced the data from each observation using the methods described in detail in @xcite and @xcite . in brief",
    ", we first created an event list for each observation in which we corrected the pulse heights of each event for the position - dependent charge - transfer inefficiency @xcite .",
    "next , we excluded events that did not pass the standard asca grade filters and cxc good - time filters .",
    "we then removed intervals in which the count rate from the diffuse emission flared to 3-@xmath19 above the mean rate in the 0.58.0 kev band , presumably due to particles impacting the detector .",
    "this removed all excursions larger than @xmath20% , which represented a total time of only 15  ks ( 2% of the total exposure ) .",
    "the remaining long - term variations in the particle background should be no larger than 5% ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the final total live time was 626 ks . before extracting spectra of the diffuse emission",
    ", we needed to remove the point sources from the image . to identify the point sources",
    ", we created a composite event list by re - projecting the sky coordinates of the events from each observation onto the plane tangent to the radio position of .",
    "we excluded the first half of obsid 1561 from the composite event list because a bright @xmath21  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  transient dominated the northwest portion of the field (;",
    "see * ? ? ?",
    "an image based upon this event list is displayed in figure  [ fig : rawimg ] .",
    "we searched for point sources in images of events in three energy bands ( 0.58  kev , 0.51.5  kev , and 48  kev ) using .",
    "we used a significance threshold of @xmath22 , which corresponds to the chance of spuriously identifying poisson fluctuations within a beam defined by the    instrumental point spread function ( psf ) .",
    "we identified a total of 2357 x - ray point sources ( see table  3 in muno et al .",
    "2003a ) , of which 1792 were detected in the full band , 281 in the soft band ( 124 exclusively in the soft band ) , and 1832 in the hard band ( 441 exclusively in the hard band ) .    to isolate the diffuse emission in each observation , we excluded events that fell within circles circumscribing the 95% contour of the psf around each point source .",
    "the excluded regions are indicated with circles in figure  [ fig : rawimg ] , and range in size from 3  within 4  of the aim - point to 7  at an offset of 7.5  from the aim - point .",
    "we found that the 95% contour struck an appropriate balance between removing most of the counts from point sources in the image , and leaving diffuse emission to analyze .",
    "for instance , in the inner few arcminutes of the image , the density of point sources is so high that the circles circumscribing the 99% contour of the psf cover the image , leaving few counts that are unambiguously diffuse emission .",
    "few photons from the observed point sources should contaminate the diffuse emission .",
    "there are only @xmath23 net counts from the point sources in the catalog of @xcite , compared to @xmath24 counts in the diffuse emission , so fewer than 0.5% of the counts in the diffuse emission should come from the wings of the psfs for the detected point sources .",
    "the flux contributed by the dust - scattering halos of the observed point sources can be estimated using the optical depth toward sources near  from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figures 1 and 8) , and the expected energy - dependent profiles of the halos from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figures 9 and 10 ) .",
    "we estimate that at 7  from the aim - point the scattered component equals the observed point - source flux at 2  kev , but declines to @xmath25% of the point - source flux above 4  kev .",
    "within 4  of the aim - point the exclusion regions for the point sources are smaller , so the contribution from scattered flux is twice as large .",
    "however , point sources produce only 4% of the diffuse flux at 2  kev and 15% above 4 kev ( see section  [ sec : ps ] ) , so the scattered flux contributes only a few percent to the diffuse emission . for comparison ,",
    "the systematic uncertainty in the calibration of the cti - corrected acis response is similar , on order 3% .    finally , we removed the bright , filamentary features identified in the northeast portion of the image by @xcite .",
    "these features contributed @xmath20% of the    flux from this region .",
    "we used the resulting event lists to create images and spectra of the diffuse emission .",
    "we combined the event lists from each observation to produce the images of the diffuse emission in the 24  kev and 48  kev bands in figures  [ fig : softimg ] and [ fig : hardimg ] .",
    "the `` holes '' apparent in the images were left by removing the events associated with the point sources and filamentary features .",
    "these images provide a qualitative understanding of the diffuse emission .    in the soft band ( 24  kev ) ,",
    "the inner part of the image is dominated by , the nuclear stellar cluster , and sgr a east . beyond these , two lobes of x - ray emission are oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane and centered on . it is likely that these represent an outflow from the central parsec @xcite .",
    "enhanced x - ray emission is also evident in the northeast portion of the image , between the galactic center and the radio arches region located @xmath26 arcmin to the north of the image @xcite .",
    "this emission exhibits prominent he - like lines from si and s , and low - ionization k-@xmath0 emission from fe @xcite . finally , a broad ridge of emission with low surface brightness is evident to the southwest ( lower - right ) .    the hard band ( 48  kev ) is also dominated by the sgr a complex at the center of the image . at larger radii from the center ,",
    "the most prominent features are filaments dominated by low - ionization fe emission at 6.4  kev in the northeast @xcite , and a hard , continuum - dominated feature in the south @xcite .",
    "these features have been removed from the image , as they were not included when we modeled the diffuse emission .",
    "enhancements in the hard diffuse emission are also observed at the bipolar lobes , and in the northeast .    in figure",
    "[ fig : twocolor ] , we display a smoothed , three color image of the field .",
    "the red band was made using photons between 0.52.0  kev , the green with 2.04.0  kev , and the blue    with 0.48.0  kev .",
    "after removing the point sources , the image was adaptively smoothed using the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "the red band contributes very little flux to the image , because the galactic absorption column prevents us from receiving photons with energies @xmath27  kev from the galactic center .",
    "however , soft photons are received from the sgr a complex , and from a bright , slightly extended feature of uncertain nature about 6  north - northeast of .",
    "all of the other features evident in the un - smoothed images are apparent in the smoothed image .",
    "we used the images in figures  [ fig : rawimg][fig : twocolor ] to select regions from which we extracted spectra of the diffuse emission .",
    "the regions are displayed with polygons in figures  [ fig : softimg ] and [ fig : hardimg ] .",
    "five of the regions were chosen because they were particularly dark .",
    "the sixth was chosen from the bright region in the northeast to help understand the nature of the surface brightness variations in figure  [ fig : twocolor ] .",
    "we avoided the bipolar lobes and the ridge to the southwest , as they will be studied elsewhere .    in order to model the spectrum , for each region and each observation we computed an effective area function using the ciao tool , which accounts for the vignetting and satellite dither using the distribution of counts received in the extraction region .",
    "we then computed a weighted average of the effective area for each region , using as the weighting the number of counts in that region in each observation .",
    "similarly , we computed a mean response by averaging the response functions provided by @xcite from the range of detector rows covered by each region , also weighted by the number of counts in each observation .",
    "we estimated the background produced by particles impacting the detector using a 50  ks observation taken with the acis - i stowed out of the focal plane of the mirror assembly . in order to account for spatial variations in the background across the acis - i chips , we extracted the background events from regions identical to those we used for the spectra of the diffuse emission .",
    "the background observations had the same cti correction and filtering applied as we used for the source events .",
    "the area , average offset from the nominal aim point ( ) , total counts , and estimated instrumental background for each region are listed in table  [ tab : regions ] .",
    "the instrumental background represents 2025% of the total counts in the dark regions , but only 10% of the total counts in the bright region to the northwest .",
    "we note that the unresolved cosmic x - ray background contributes insignificantly to the diffuse emission .",
    "if we account for @xmath28 @xmath3 of absorption through the galaxy , and the fact that sources brighter than @xmath29  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  ( 28  kev ; de - absorbed to match the deep - field surveys ) should have been detected , less than 1% of the observed diffuse emission is from extra - galactic background ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    figure  [ fig : diffraw ] displays the source and background spectrum of the southeast region , which has the highest signal - to - noise of the dark regions .",
    "many lines are detected in the spectrum : the he - like @xmath30 transitions of si , s , ar , ca , and fe ; the he - like @xmath31 transitions of si and s ; the h - like @xmath30 transitions of si , s , ar , and fe ; low - ionization ( `` neutral '' ) fe k-@xmath0 at 6.4  kev ; and an instrumental ni line at 7.5  kev .",
    "background - subtracted spectra are displayed in figure  [ fig : diffmod ] ; the absence of the instrumental ni line at 7.5  kev indicates that the background subtraction was successful , whereas the other lines are clearly intrinsic to the diffuse emission .    motivated by past investigations , we modeled the spectrum of the diffuse emission in two ways . first , we modeled the spectrum between 18  kev using two thermal plasma components .",
    "second , we analyzed the spectrum between 4.58.0  kev in order to examine the properties of the iron lines .      as pointed out by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the prominent line emission in the spectrum suggests that it originates from optically thin plasma , whereas the simultaneous presence of fe with si , s , and ar suggests that the plasma has multiple temperature components .",
    "the plasma model we used ( in ; see also , e.g. , raymond & smith 1977 ; mewe , lemen , & van den oord 1986 ; borkowski , sarazin , & blondin 1994 ) assumes that it is in collisional ionization equilibrium , and is able to self - consistently account for both the continuum emission and the lines from h - like and he - like species .",
    "the neutral fe emission must be included ad - hoc as an additional gaussian component .",
    "several assumptions were required for the model to reproduce the data .",
    "first , we only applied the model between 1.0 and 8.0  kev .",
    "below this energy range the photon counts are dominated by foreground emission , while above this range the spectra are background - dominated .",
    "second , we examined data taken in 2002 may from the on - board calibration sources ( which produce lines at the k-@xmath0 and k-@xmath33 transitions from al , ti , and mn when the detector is exposed to them ) , and found that even after applying the cti correction the observed line centroids were slightly below their expected values .",
    "the shift ranged from @xmath34% near the detector read - out ( at the top and bottom of figure  [ fig : rawimg ] ) , up to @xmath35% at the top of each ccd ( the center of the image ) .",
    "therefore , we allowed for a @xmath36% shift in the energy scale in each spectrum . when fitting a gaussian to the 6.4  kev line of fe , the line centroids were allowed to vary once , and then were frozen . when using plasma models , the red - shift parameter was used to change the energy scale",
    "third , a 3% systematic uncertainty was added in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty on the count rate in order to account for uncertainties in the acis effective area .",
    "finally , we found that we needed to allow the abundances of si , s , ar , ca , and fe to vary independently to obtain an adequate fit .    to account for absorption we assumed ( 1 ) that the entire region was affected by one column of material that represents the average galactic absorption ( modeled with in ) and ( 2 ) that a fraction of each region was affected by a second column that represents absorbing material with a smaller filling factor along the line of sight ( modeled with ) .",
    "the absorption model roughly accounts for the fact that both the plasma and absorbing material are distributed along the line of sight ( see , e.g. , vollmer , zylka , & duschl 2003 ) .",
    "the mathematical form of the model was @xmath37 + fe^{-\\sigma(e)n_{\\rm pc , h } } ) , \\label{eq : abs}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the energy - dependent absorption cross - section , @xmath39 is the absorption column , @xmath40 is the partial - covering column , and @xmath41 is the partial - covering fraction . the absorption was modeled using a separate factor ( i.e. , equation  [ eq : abs ] ) for each plasma component , although , aside from the quality of the fits , the basic results do not change if we use a single absorption factor for both plasma components .",
    "we note that for the soft plasma component the best - fit value of @xmath41 approached 1 and was poorly constrained , so we fixed its value to @xmath42 .    despite the complexity of the diffuse emission in the image ,",
    "the spectra from all of the regions are basically described with the same collisional - equilibrium plasma model .",
    "we list the best - fit parameters for this model in each of the regions in table  [ tab : twokt ] , and display them in figure  [ fig : diffmod ] .",
    "the uncertainties are @xmath43 , derived from a search in chi - squared space with @xmath44 .",
    "the value of @xmath45 from some regions is formally poor , but this is not surprising given that the properties of the diffuse emission probably vary somewhat within each of the regions in figures  [ fig : softimg ] and [ fig : hardimg ] .",
    "we note that two - temperature non - equilibrium plasma models ( and in ; masai 1984 ) did not reproduce the data nearly as well , as they yielded @xmath46 for all combinations of free parameters and absorption components . moreover , the best - fit ionization parameters under those models were larger than @xmath47 s @xmath48 , which reinforces the suggestion that the diffuse emission originates from plasma in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the absorption columns derived are consistent with the expected galactic values .",
    "the soft , @xmath1  kev component has a total column of approximately @xmath49  @xmath3 , assuming that the partial - covering absorber affects 95% of the field .",
    "this indicates that only a small fraction of the soft diffuse emission originates in the foreground .",
    "the hot , @xmath7  kev component is absorbed by about @xmath50 @xmath3 over the entire region , with additional absorption of @xmath51 @xmath3 affecting on order half of each region .",
    "the additional partial - covering absorption column is comparable to that which could be provided by the typical molecular clouds in the region , @xmath52  @xmath3 ( zylka , mezger , & wink 1990 ) . the higher absorption toward the hard component is probably a selection effect , caused by the fact that no trace of the soft component could emerge from behind @xmath53 @xmath3 of absorption .",
    "the differences in the absorption column from field - to - field are not surprising given the non - uniform distribution of molecular clouds near the galactic center .",
    "the temperatures of the two plasma components , @xmath54  kev and @xmath55  kev , both differ from region to region .",
    "the temperature of the cooler component is well - constrained by the lines of si , s , and ar , and changes by at most 0.1  kev if a different absorption model is assumed .",
    "for example , assuming identical absorption for the cool and hot components , the derived temperature decreases to 0.6  kev for some of the regions , but the differences persist . therefore , the dispersion in    the values of @xmath56 are significant . on the other hand ,",
    "the temperature of the hot component is determined both by the ratio of the h - like and he - like lines and by the continuum above 5  kev , and is more uncertain because the effective area of the detector there is smaller .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 differs by up to 2  kev when the absorption model is changed .",
    "for instance , when a single absorption factor of the form of equation  [ eq : abs ] is assumed , @xmath57 increases to 10  kev because the continuum is inferred to be flatter . as a result of the poorer constraint , the differences in @xmath57 are only significant at the @xmath58 level .",
    "the fluxes of both spectral components also vary spatially .",
    "the emission measures are better correlated with the observed flux than are the temperatures , which suggests that the density or volume of the plasma is the most important factor determining the surface brightness of the diffuse emission .",
    "the flux from both plasma components is highest in the east and northeast , as expected from the images in figures  [ fig : softimg ] and [ fig : hardimg ] .",
    "the differences in the soft emission is the most dramatic : it is lowest in the northwest , southeast , and southwest , 50% higher in the region close to the galactic center , a factor of 3 higher in the east , and a factor of 9 brighter in the northeast . on the other hand ,",
    "the observed flux from the hard component differs by less than 10% in the four dark regions located at @xmath59  from , and is only a 60% higher in the close region and in the northeast .",
    "the inferred de - absorbed hard fluxes differ even less , as the brightest regions produce only 25% more flux than the darkest . under the two - temperature plasma model",
    ", there appear to be significant ranges in the elemental abundances both when comparing individual elements , and when comparing the dark and bright regions .",
    "unfortunately , we have found that the abundances of all of the metals can be made consistent with solar values if we add a third thermal plasma component with @xmath60  kev to the model .",
    "therefore , we must view the measured abundances with skepticism .",
    "it will be necessary to obtain spectra of the diffuse emission with higher energy resolution to draw firm conclusions about the metal abundances in the emitting material .",
    "finally , we note that the neutral fe emission at 6.4  kev is a factor of 4 more intense in the northeast than in the rest of the regions examined .",
    "this can be seen clearly in the equivalent width maps of @xcite .",
    "the strength of the 6.4  kev fe emission clearly increases with that of the soft component of the diffuse emission in figure  [ fig : softimg ] , although it tends to appear in more strongly localized regions than the soft plasma .",
    "in fact , neutral fe emission is responsible for the bright filamentary features in the northeast of the hard image @xcite .",
    "these models are the simplest that we have found that reproduce the data . however , the intrinsic spectrum conceivably could be more complicated .",
    "for instance , if the low - ionization fe line is produced as part of a reflection nebula , it should be accompanied by a scattered continuum component ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it has also been proposed that there is a non - thermal component to the spectrum between 28 kev , which represents a low - energy extension of the power - law emission seen above 10  kev ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* but see lebrun  2004 ) .",
    "adding a power - law component with photon index @xmath61 does not significantly improve the fit , although the lower bound on the temperature of the hot plasma decreases to @xmath62 kev .",
    "likewise , adding a third plasma component does not improve the fit .",
    "none of the additional components change the basic conclusions that we present in section  [ sec : disc ] .      as we will discuss in section  [ sec : disc ] , a thermal plasma containing he - like and h - like ions of fe will inevitably be too hot to be bound to the galactic plane , and will therefore require a very large amount of energy to sustain .",
    "this has led several authors to propose that much of the continuum and iron emission are produced by non - thermal processes .",
    "if this is the case , then the centroid energies , widths , and line ratios of the iron emission provide the best constraints on these models .",
    "therefore , we have modeled the fe k-@xmath0 , he-@xmath0 , and h-@xmath0 line complexes with three gaussians .",
    "the fe he-@xmath0 line is a combination of forbidden ( 6.63 kev ) , inter - combination ( 6.67 kev ) , and resonance ( 6.70 kev ) transitions that can not be resolved as separate lines with the acis - i .",
    "likewise , the fe h-@xmath0 line ( 6.97 kev ) should contain a contribution from the k-@xmath33 transition ( 7.03 kev ) , which has an intensity that is @xmath63% of that of the k-@xmath0 transition ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we modeled the continuum emission between 4.58.0 kev with a power law to facilitate the computation of equivalent widths .",
    "the resulting model parameters are listed in table  [ tab : iron ] .",
    "the uncertainties are 1@xmath19 , derived from a search in chi - squared space with @xmath44 for the centroids , widths , and intensities , and @xmath64 for the ratios of the intensities .",
    "one of the best diagnostics of the non - thermal models are the centroid energies of the lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the shift in the gain of",
    "the acis - i mentioned above , the observed energies of the fe he-@xmath0 and h-@xmath0 lines are shifted to lower energies by @xmath36% .",
    "these shifts are significant at the @xmath65 level .",
    "however , the fe k-@xmath0 lines lie , within their uncertainties , right at the expected energy of 6.40  kev .",
    "if we account for a 0.5% shift to lower energies , its true centroid could be as high as 6.43  kev .    in some cases ,",
    "non - thermal models for the iron emission also predict that the lines should be broadened ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the widths of the k-@xmath0 and he-@xmath0 lines can only be constrained meaningfully with the two spectra that have the highest signal - to - noise , those from the northeast and southeast . in the northeast",

    "the fe he-@xmath0 line also appears to be resolved in the northeast , with a width of @xmath69 ev , while in the southeast the upper limit to the width is 40 ev . in both cases , however , the width is consistent with the 70 ev separation between the recombination and forbidden lines .",
    "these widths are lower than those reported from asca data by @xcite ( @xmath70 ev ) .",

    "next , we compare the average spectrum of the detected point sources to that of the diffuse emission .",
    "finally , we assume that    undetected point sources have spectra identical to the detected sources , and determine the maximum flux that they could contribute to the diffuse emission .    in muno",
    "et al . ( 2004 ) , we examine the spectra of the point sources in considerable detail ; the methods for extracting and combining the spectra of the point sources are described there . in brief , we extracted spectra from within the 90% contour of the psf around each point source using the routine from the tools for x - ray analysis ( tara ) .",
    "we then summed the resulting spectra for each region .",
    "we computed the effective area functions for each source using , corrected them for the fraction of the psf enclosed by each region and for the hydrocarbon build - up on the detectors .",
    "we then averaged the effective area weighted by the count rate from each source .",
    "finally , we averaged the response functions that accompany the @xcite cti - corrector from the location of each point source , again weighted by the counts from each source . in order to confirm that the point - source spectra were not contaminated by diffuse emission , we re - extracted the spectra for several hundred point sources from regions that enclosed only 50% of the psf , and found that the resulting average spectrum was indistinguishable from that extracted from the 90% contour of the psf .",
    "vignetting limits our ability to resolve point sources at large offset angles from the aim - point , so we first established that a failure to resolve point sources does not affect our estimates of the diffuse flux . to do so , we extracted a summed spectrum from the point sources in each region .",
    "we used the diffuse emission from each region to estimate the background , and modeled the point source spectra with the same two-@xmath32 model as for the diffuse emission .",
    "we list the surface brightness from detected point sources per square arcminute in table  [ tab : difflux ] , along with the total , soft , and hard flux from the diffuse emission .",
    "the flux from detected point sources is nearly identical in all of the dark regions located @xmath71  from the aim - point .",
    "therefore , we have probably been equally successful at resolving point sources in each dark region .",
    "a larger flux from point sources is observed in the northeast . although this excess flux from point sources could indicate that there are more stellar x - ray sources in this region , it is more likely that we mistakenly identified small knots in the diffuse emission as point sources .",
    "larger knots that could be identified as extended by eye were removed from the point source list .",
    "the flux from detected point sources close to the galactic center is higher because ( 1 ) the angular resolution is better within 5  of the aim point ( ) , so that it is possible to detect fainter sources , and ( 2 ) the surface density of point sources increases as @xmath72 toward .",
    "next , we compared the spectrum of the point sources from the entire field to that of the diffuse emission .",
    "we found in muno et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the averaged spectrum of the point sources changed only slightly when considering sources with intensities that ranged over a factor of    @xmath73 , so we chose to compare the spectrum of point sources with fewer than 80 net counts to that of the diffuse emission .",
    "we used the spectrum of the diffuse emission from the entire field to estimate the background for the point sources .",
    "the average spectrum of the point sources and spectrum of the diffuse emission from the southeast are displayed in figure  [ fig : psvdiff ] , while the ratios between count spectra from the dark regions of diffuse emission to that from the point sources is displayed in figure  [ fig : pscomp ] .",
    "as noted by @xcite , the shapes and relative intensities of the he - like and h - like iron lines appear qualitatively similar in the point sources and diffuse emission . under the two-@xmath32 plasma model for the point sources , we find that the soft 0.8  kev component is heavily absorbed , so that it contributes only 3% of the total observed 28 kev flux .",
    "the hot 8  kev plasma component produces the remainder of the observed flux .",
    "therefore , the near - absence of a soft component is the main reason that the point source spectra appear much harder .    in order to determine an upper limit to the amount of flux that undetected point sources can contribute to the diffuse emission",
    ", we have added a spectral component representing the point sources with fewer than 80 net counts to our two-@xmath32 models for the diffuse emission .",
    "only a constant normalization for the fiducial point source spectrum was allowed to vary , while the parameters of the spectral components representing the diffuse emission were allowed to vary as in section  [ sec : twokt ] .",
    "we increased the value of the constant normalization until @xmath45 exceeded a threshold that corresponded to a 10% chance that the model and data were consistent .",
    "if the initial model was acceptable , the threshold was @xmath74 for 456 degrees of freedom .",
    "however , in a couple of cases the initial model including the point source spectrum was unacceptable at the 90% confidence level ( see table  [ tab : twokt ] ) , so we varied the normalization until @xmath45 increased by @xmath75 ( this is equivalent to inflating the assumed uncertainties to force @xmath76 to equal 1 for the best - fit model ) .",
    "the surface brightness of the diffuse emission that can be accounted for by undetected point sources is listed by region in table  [ tab : difflux ] .",
    "undetected point sources may produce @xmath77 erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcmin@xmath5  in the regions 7  from the galactic center , which is 3580% of the total observed diffuse flux .",

    ". we also list in table  [ tab : difflux ] the flux from the soft and hard components that remains when an undetected point source contribution is subtracted .",
    "the reduction in inferred diffuse flux is most dramatic in the hard band : in the southeast , southwest , and close dark regions , a hard diffuse component is not necessary if one includes a contribution of undetected point sources in the spectrum .",
    "moreover , the remaining three regions in which undetected point sources can not replace the hard component of the diffuse emission are also those regions in which the initial model for the diffuse emission ( without the point source component ) was formally unacceptable .",
    "the similarity between the spectra of the point sources and diffuse emission suggests that all of the hard diffuse emission could be produced by point sources .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so it is important to consider the amount of energy that could be lost as the plasma expands .",
    "if we use the galactic potential from breitschwerdt , mckenzie , & vlk ( 1991 ) , we find that the escape velocity from the galactic center ( @xmath111 pc ) is approximately 900 km s@xmath4 . this can be compared to the sound speed of the plasma @xmath112 .",
    "if we assume @xmath113 ( for a monotonic , adiabatic gas ) and @xmath114 ( electrons and protons ) , the sound speed for the 0.8 kev plasma is @xmath115 km s@xmath4 , and for the 8 kev plasma is @xmath116  km s@xmath4 .",
    "therefore , only the cooler plasma is gravitationally bound to the galaxy",
    ". however , in the absence of other confining forces , even the soft plasma could expand significantly ; the contribution of the @xmath117  @xmath94  within the central 10 pc of the galaxy ( laundhardt , zylka , & mezger 2002 ) is negligible when considering whether the plasma can expand , as the corresponding escape velocity from the central parsecs is only 150 km s@xmath4 . using the potential in @xcite",
    ", the 0.8 kev plasma could expand to a height of several hundred parsecs .",
    "upper limits to the energy required to sustain the plasma components can be obtained by assuming that they expand adiabatically and form a wind from the galactic center .",
    "although computing the energy loss rate rigorously would require a full solution of wind equations such as those in @xcite , we can make a rough estimate of it by assuming @xmath118 .",
    "for the soft component of the plasma , the energy loss rate is @xmath119  erg s@xmath4arcmin@xmath5 , 300 times higher than the x - ray luminosity of the plasma .",
    "for the hot component of the plasma , this energy loss rate is @xmath120  erg s@xmath4arcmin@xmath5 , or 4 orders of magnitude higher than its x - ray luminosity . over the entire image ,",
    "the upper limit to the power required is @xmath10 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding cooling time if the plasma is expanding is @xmath121 years for the @xmath1  kev plasma , and @xmath122 years for the @xmath7 kev plasma .",
    "these are much shorter than the radiative cooling time scales .",
    "even if external forces are on average sufficient to confine the diffuse plasma , any over - density in the plasma should be smoothed out in a short time by the differential rotation at the galactic center . at 10 pc and for an enclosed mass of @xmath123  @xmath94 the orbital time scale is @xmath124 years . therefore , differential rotation would smooth out any variations in the plasma properties with a radial extent @xmath125 on a time scale of @xmath126 .",
    "for parsec - scale features , @xmath127 years , which is comparable to the cooling time of the soft plasma , but significantly shorter than the cooling time of the hard plasma .",
    "the pronounced variations in the surface brightness of the soft , @xmath1  kev component of the diffuse emission ( figure  [ fig : softimg ] ) have important implications for the spatial distribution and age of the putative plasma that produces it .",
    "the fact that the spatial variations are much more pronounced in the soft emission than in the hard ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) suggests that the soft plasma occupies a much smaller volume .",
    "indeed , if we assume that the soft and hard plasma are in pressure equilibrium , then the filling factor of the soft plasma would have to be roughly 110% of that of the hard plasma . at the same time ,",
    "any over - density in the soft plasma is unlikely to survive very long , because the differential rotation of the galactic center should shear apart any coherent features .",
    "for example , the bright diffuse emission in the northeast has an angular extent that corresponds to a size of @xmath84 pc , and so differential rotation should dissipate it within the orbital time scale of @xmath128 y.    the youth and small filling factor of the @xmath1 kev plasma are easily understandable if it is produced by supernova remnants .",
    "this is the common explanation for the origin of similar soft diffuse emission that is observed throughout the galactic disk , because supernova remnants are often observed to have spectra consistent with @xmath129 kev plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "supernova are also the largest known source of energy for heating the ism @xcite , and can easily provide enough energy to heat the diffuse soft plasma . if we assume that the dominant cooling mechanism for the soft plasma is radiative , then the energy input required to sustain it is only @xmath130 erg s@xmath4 for the inner 20 pc of the galaxy . if , on analogy with the conclusions of @xcite for the galactic disk , we assume that @xmath129% of the @xmath131 erg of kinetic energy per supernova heats the soft plasma in our image , then it could be sustained by supernova occurring at a rate of one every @xmath132 y. this is not unreasonable , because the total galactic supernova rate is thought to be on order 1 per 100 y , and the inner 20 pc of the galaxy contains approximately 0.1% of the galactic mass @xcite , so the expected rate in this field is also about one supernova per @xmath132 y. moreover , sgr a east @xcite and the radio wisp e @xcite are already thought to be remnants of recent supernova , so it seems likely that the inner 20 pc of the galaxy has experienced a supernova rate at least this high .",
    "it is also possible that the winds from young , massive wolf - rayet and early o stars could contribute to the @xmath133 kev plasma .",
    "a typical wr star can lose mass at a rate of @xmath134 y@xmath4 with a velocity of @xmath135 km s@xmath4 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the kinetic energy of such a wind is @xmath136  erg s@xmath4 .",
    "x - rays are produced by internal shocks in the winds of individual stars , but diffuse x - rays are only produced by the large shocks that occur when winds from clusters of these stars encounter the interstellar medium . in observations of massive star clusters , about 10% of the wind kinetic energy",
    "is converted into x - rays @xcite .",
    "therefore , a single wr and/or early o star could in principle produce the soft component of the diffuse emission . however , extended x - ray emission from massive stars is usually only associated with young stellar clusters that contain several massive stars within a core radius of @xmath137  pc , which typically produce x - rays in a region only @xmath138 pc in radius @xcite",
    ". therefore , the x - ray emission from the winds of massive stars is likely to only be important within an arcminute of any as - yet - undiscovered star clusters .",
    "the detection of strong @xmath1 kev emission to the northeast of the galactic center is also consistent with our assumption that the soft plasma originates from supernovae and winds from massive stars .",
    "the northeast region possesses several interesting properties that may be related to the enhanced diffuse x - ray emission : it contains large amounts of molecular gas ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tsuboi , handa , & ukita 1999 ; mezger , duschl , & zylka 1996 ; ) , it is located between young , massive star clusters at the galactic center @xcite and the radio arches region @xcite , and it is the site of the strongest low - ionization fe emission @xcite .",
    "the mere presence of molecular clouds is clearly not sufficient for forming the soft diffuse and 6.4  kev fe emission , as molecular clouds are also evident in the southeast , without any corresponding enhancement in the iron emission @xcite . given the arguments for the origin of the soft plasma above , it is more likely that both the soft diffuse emission and the neutral fe emission are associated with recent star formation .",
    "for instance , a type  ii supernova in the northeast could produce both the bright , soft diffuse emission and the neutral fe emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "outside of the galactic center , the most similar region may well be the carina nebula , which exhibits @xmath139  erg s@xmath4of x - rays from the outflow around @xmath140 car , the wr and o stars in the cluster trumpler 14 , and diffuse emission that may have resulted from recent supernovae @xcite .",
    "the hard , @xmath7  kev emission is distributed much more uniformly than the soft , but its intensity is still correlated with that of the soft emission .",
    "the correlation between the hard and soft emission suggests that they are produced by related physical processes .",
    "the relative uniformity of the hard emission may result from its higher sound speed , which would cause over - dense regions of @xmath7  kev plasma to expand on a time scale of @xmath141 y.    however , the @xmath7 kev plasma is somewhat hotter than is usually observed from either supernova remnants or clusters of wr and early o stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "moreover , the sound speed of the hot plasma is larger than the escape velocity from the galactic center , and therefore the energy required to sustain the expanding @xmath7 kev plasma within the image in figure  [ fig : twocolor ] is @xmath10 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this energy is four orders of magnitude larger than that required to sustain the @xmath1  kev plasma ( which probably does not cool by expanding ) , and is equivalent to the entire kinetic energy of one supernova occurring every 3000 y. this makes it difficult to understand the origin of this putative hot plasma , because supernovae are assumed to be the largest source of heat for the ism .",
    "moreover , using the values in table  [ tab : prop ] , the plasma flowing out from within the inner @xmath142 pc of the galaxy would carry away a mass of roughly @xmath143 @xmath94  y@xmath4 .",
    "this mass loss rate is also equivalent to that from one supernova occurring every 3000 y. finally , this @xmath7 kev diffuse emission is observed from throughout the galactic disk , so the mechanism producing it must be widespread . in particular , the hot diffuse emission is probably not produced by the super - massive black hole at the galactic center , .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the origin of the @xmath7 kev component of the galactic diffuse emission .",
    "one possibility is that the hard plasma is heated by magnetic reconnection that is driven by the turbulence that supernovae generate in the ism @xcite .",
    "magnetic connection could heat the plasma to @xmath144 , or , for @xmath145 @xmath48 and @xmath146 mg ( table  [ tab : prop ] ) , @xmath147 kev .",
    "fields of comparable strength are inferred to exist near the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , @xcite also pointed out that with the right geometry , the same fields would also be strong enough to confine the @xmath7 kev plasma , thus possibly reducing the amount of energy required to sustain it .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetic fields toward the galactic center appear unlikely to confine the hot plasma .",
    "individual magnetic flux tubes are observed as synchrotron - emitting radio filaments oriented perpendicular to the galactic plane @xcite .",
    "these filaments seem to be interacting with molecular clouds in the region , and are therefore thought to have pressures comparable to those of the turbulent molecular clouds , so that @xmath148 mg ( compare * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , it is not clear whether the filaments represent only a small fraction of vertical fields that pervade the galactic center ( serabyn & morris 1996 ; chandran , cowley , & morris 2000 ) , or whether they represent purely local magnetic features @xcite .",
    "there is also a toroidal component observed through polarization measurements that dominates within molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "however , the zeeman - splitting measurements of @xcite placed upper limits of @xmath149 mg to the strength of any arcminute - scale ordered fields along the lines - of - sights towards most of the molecular clouds near the galactic center ; the only zeeman measurements that reveal fields @xmath150 mg are toward the circum - nuclear disk @xcite .",
    "taken together , these observations suggest that the magnetic fields are predominantly vertical at the galactic center , with a toroidal component produced by orbital shear in the molecular clouds @xcite",
    ". therefore , any hot plasma at the galactic center would be able to escape vertically away from the plane , thus forming a wind or fountain of plasma ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "another class of hypotheses assume that the hard component of the galactic diffuse emission is produced by non - thermal processes associated with supernova shocks .",
    "for instance , low - energy ( @xmath151 mev ) cosmic rays could interact with the neutral ism to produce continuum emission through bremsstrahlung radiation and line emission through charge - exchange interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the cosmic - ray electrons could be accelerated by supernova or young pulsars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . originally , this model was attractive because it could also explain the non - thermal x - ray emission observed above 10  kev .",
    "however , observations with _ integral _ have resolved @xmath152% of the emission above 20  kev into discrete point sources @xcite .",
    "moreover , neither non - thermal electrons nor protons are efficient at producing bremsstrahlung radiation , so the energy required to produce the observed diffuse emission is nearly as large as that required to replenish a continually - expanding thermal plasma @xcite . finally , the model presented by @xcite does not predict the presence of the fe h-@xmath0 line at 6.9 kev , which is clearly evident in our _ chandra _  spectra ( figure  [ fig : diffraw ] and table  [ tab : iron ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the hard diffuse emission could originate from a quasi - thermal plasma that is generated by supernova shocks that propagate through the cooler 0.8  kev plasma @xcite .",
    "this process is a factor of @xmath153 more efficient at generating x - rays than is an expanding thermal plasma .",
    "therefore , an energy input of @xmath154  erg s@xmath4 , or the kinetic energy of one supernova occurring every @xmath155 y , is required to produce the observed hard diffuse emission . however , neither of the two model spectra presented by @xcite are entirely consistent with the data in table  [ tab : iron ] .",
    "their models predict that fe k-@xmath0 lines should be of comparable strength as the he-@xmath0 line at 6.7  kev , whereas in all of the dark regions the fe k-@xmath0 lines are a factor of 23 weaker , and in the northeast bright region it is a factor of 1.8 stronger .",
    "their models also predict that the fe he-@xmath0 lines should be a factor of 1.72.5 stronger than the fe h-@xmath0 lines ( depending upon whether the background plasma has a temperature of 0.6 or 0.3 kev ) , whereas we find values that are generally higher , albeit only at the 12@xmath19 level in each case .",
    "finally , they predict that if the shocks form in a cool ( 0.3  kev ) background plasma , then the low - ionization fe line should have a centroid near 6.5  kev .",
    "the observed centroids are consistent with 6.4  kev , and values as high as 6.5  kev are excluded at the @xmath156 level in the southwest and northeast .",
    "therefore , the non - thermal models that have been published to date are challenged by the remarkable similarity between the observed spectrum and that expected from a @xmath7  kev plasma in thermal equilibrium .",
    "however , further exploration of the parameter space of the non - thermal models is needed to confirm or refute them definitively .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath7  kev plasma is also very similar to that of the faintest detected point sources .",
    "therefore , in this section we use the @xmath157 distribution from equation 5 in @xcite to compute the number of point sources that would be required to produce the hard diffuse emission in the darkest region of the   erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcmin@xmath5  in the northwest .",
    "the @xmath157 distribution allows us to compute the surface density of sources down to a limiting flux @xmath158 . adapting the results of @xcite",
    ", we find : @xmath159 we have made several modifications to this equation from the original version .",
    "first , we have included a factor @xmath160 for the offset from  in arcminutes , which accounts for the decrease in surface density of the point sources within 9  from the galactic center .",
    "second , we have converted the photon fluxes in @xcite to energy fluxes by assuming 1  photons @xmath3 s@xmath4  @xmath161  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4  ( 2.08  kev ) , which is appropriate for a @xmath162 power - law spectrum absorbed by a @xmath163  @xmath3 column of gas and dust . finally , we have normalized the distribution in equation  [ eq : mod ] to the surface density at @xmath164 , whereas equation  5 from @xcite was normalized to the density at 4.5 .",
    "we can then obtain the total flux from point sources ( @xmath165 ) in any given region by integrating the power laws in equation  [ eq : mod ] : @xmath166 \\\\ \\times \\int { { 1 } \\over { \\theta } } da .",
    "\\label{eq : flux}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath0 is the power - law slope , @xmath167 is the scale factor for the flux , and @xmath168 is the normalization of the power law , all from equation  [ eq : mod ] .",
    "@xmath169 and @xmath170 are the bounds on the point - source flux over which the total flux @xmath165 is computed . for the bright end of the distribution in equation  [ eq : mod ] ,",
    "we assume @xmath170 is @xmath171  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , which is the brightest point source that we observe in the image ; the values of @xmath165 are not very sensitive to this assumed upper bound .",
    "the number of point sources in a region is then found by inserting the assumed value of @xmath165 and solving for @xmath169 in equation  [ eq : flux ] , and then inserting @xmath169 into equation  [ eq : mod ] . based on the observed hard diffuse and point source flux in the northwest ( table  [ tab : regions ] and [ tab : difflux ] ) , we take @xmath172  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 , and find @xmath173  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "using this limiting flux in the @xmath174 distribution , we would predict a surface density of 800 undetected sources arcmin@xmath5 at an offset of 4.5  from , or a total of @xmath175 sources within 20 pc ( 9 ) of .",
    "there is no known class object of that could account for that large a number of hard x - ray sources at the galactic center .",
    "in fact , the total stellar mass within the inner 20 pc of the galaxy is only @xmath176 @xmath94  @xcite , so in order to account for the diffuse emission , @xmath177% of all stellar sources would have to be hard x - ray sources with @xmath178  erg s@xmath4 .",
    "the only plausible candidates for such a large population of hard x - ray sources are cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) and young stellar objects ( ysos ) . we can estimate the number of cvs within 20 pc of the galactic center by scaling their local density by the relative stellar mass density . based upon the mass model of @xcite , the stellar density in the inner 20 pc is 1000 @xmath94  pc@xmath179 , compared to a local density of 0.1 @xmath94  pc@xmath179 .",
    "the local space density of cvs is at most @xmath180 pc@xmath179 @xcite , so the space density at the galactic center should be less than @xmath181 pc@xmath179 .",
    "therefore , we expect only @xmath141 cvs there , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the number of point sources needed to explain the hard component of the diffuse emission . the number of ysos would depend on the recent formation rate for low - mass stars .",
    "if stars have formed steadily over the @xmath182 gyr lifetime of the galaxy , then the @xmath183  @xmath94  of stars within the inner 20  pc would have formed at a rate of @xmath184 y@xmath4 , which would imply that there should be @xmath141 stars younger than 1  myr old .",
    "this number is comparable to the limit obtained from the fact that only @xmath185 hard x - ray sources in our field exhibit flares with luminosities and durations that are similar to one seen from ysos @xcite . about 0.1% of ysos exhibit flares that would have been detectable from the galactic center , which suggests that @xmath186 ysos lie near the galactic center @xcite , which is still far too few to produce the hard diffuse emission .",
    "other x - ray sources that are similarly abundant are unlikely to contribute to the hard component of the diffuse emission because their luminosities are too low or their spectra are too soft .",
    "for instance , although rs cvns are at least as numerous as cvs @xcite , they have thermal spectra with @xmath187 kev @xcite . likewise , while isolated neutron stars accreting from the interstellar medium could make up @xmath129% of the mass of the galactic center @xcite , they must be less luminous than @xmath188  erg s@xmath4 , or else many thousands of similar systems would have been detected in the local galaxy in the _ rosat _ all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "in contrast , less than a dozen candidate isolated neutron stars were identified with _",
    "rosat_. therefore , if the diffuse emission is produced by undetected point sources , they would have to belong to a population of sources that has not yet been identified .",
    "using a 600  ks exposure with the acis - i aboard _ chandra _ , we have studied the spectrum of diffuse x - ray emission from several regions within a projected distance of 20 pc of .",
    "the spectrum of the diffuse emission exhibits he - like and h - like lines from si , s , ar , ca , and fe , as well as a prominent low - ionization fe line . if the spectrum is modeled as originating from diffuse plasma , two components with temperatures of 0.8  kev and 8  kev are required , along with line emission from low - ionization fe at 6.4  kev .",
    "the energies and flux ratios of the lines from both temperature components are consistent with emission from plasmas in collisional ionization equilibrium .    in table",
    "[ tab : summary ] , we provide a summary of the origins of the x - ray emission between 28 kev from the inner 20 pc of the galaxy . by far",
    "the largest contribution to the luminosity of the galactic center is from diffuse emission . in comparison ,",
    "detected point sources contribute only 10% to the luminosity of the galactic center , while discrete filamentary features contribute less than 5% of the total luminosity of the inner 20  pc of the galaxy .",
    "these results are potentially useful for understanding the origin of diffuse x - ray emission from distant galaxies with quiescent central black holes .",
    "however , it is important to note that these observations of the galactic center are strongly affected by interstellar absorption with a column density of at least @xmath189 @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the cool emission with @xmath190 kev that produces most of the 0.58.0 kev flux from distant galaxies is obscured at the galactic center . at the same time , _ chandra _  observations of other galaxies are not sensitive to the @xmath7 kev plasma that dominates the flux we observe from the galactic center , because this hard emission has a much lower surface brightness than the @xmath191 kev emission where the _ chandra _  effective area is largest ( 0.53 kev ) , and it is difficult to resolve from bright x - ray binaries .",
    "thus , these observations of the galactic center provide a unique view of the hottest components of the ism of galaxies .",
    "the properties of the soft , @xmath1  kev plasma component of the diffuse emission vary significantly across the image , both in temperature between 0.7 and 0.9  kev , and in surface brightness between @xmath192 and @xmath193  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcmin@xmath5 .",
    "the variation in the properties of the soft plasma suggest that it is relatively young , because differential rotation at the galactic center should destroy any coherent features within @xmath194 y. supernovae probably supply most of this energy , although the winds from wr and early o stars could also contribute . within the inner 20 pc of the galaxy ,",
    "the @xmath130 erg s@xmath4 lost by the plasma through radiative cooling could be replaced by 1% of the kinetic energy of one supernova occurring every @xmath195 y. the inner 20 pc of our galaxy contains about 0.1% of its total mass , so assuming that one supernova occurs every 100 y in the galaxy , this rate is roughly consistent with that expected near the galactic center .",
    "the hard component of the diffuse emission is more spatially uniform than the soft , but the intensities of the two components are still correlated .",
    "although this might suggest a common origin for the two plasma components , supernovae and massive stars are not usually observed to produce plasma with @xmath18 kev .",
    "this hard emission is distributed throughout the galactic plane , so it is not likely to be associated with an outburst from . instead",
    ", the hard emission could result from a @xmath196  kev plasma that is heated indirectly by massive stars and supernova remnants , which , for example , could drive reconnection in the magnetic fields near the galactic center @xcite .",
    "however , a 8  kev thermal plasma would freely expand away from the galactic center , and would require @xmath197 erg s@xmath4 to sustain .",
    "this is equivalent to the entire kinetic energy of one supernova every 3000 years , which is a much larger rate than usually assumed for supernova .",
    "supernova are the most energetic source of heat for the ism , so if the hard diffuse emission is produced by a @xmath7 kev plasma , it would imply that there is a significant shortcoming in our understanding of heating mechanisms for the ism .",
    "alternative explanations for the hard diffuse emission that were intended to lessen the energy required are equally unsatisfying .",
    "the suggestion that the hard diffuse emission originates from undetected stellar x - ray sources is unlikely because there is no known class of source that are numerous enough , bright enough , and hot enough to produce the observed flux of @xmath7 kev diffuse emission . likewise ,",
    "if the hard diffuse emission originates from non - thermal processes , such as the shocks that accelerate cosmic rays , the energies and ratios of the intensities of the line emission should deviate measurably from the values expected for a plasma in thermal equilibrium ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these deviations are not observed in our _ chandra _  observations , which presents a challenge to the current non - thermal models .",
    "further observations should clarify the nature of the diffuse x - ray emission from the galactic center .",
    "x - ray missions with higher spectral resolution , such as astro - e 2 , will be able to better - constrain the properties of the putative diffuse plasma by resolving the individual transitions of he - like and h - like fe , and possibly measuring the velocity dispersions of the fe ions themselves .",
    "alternatively , a future hard x - ray survey , such as exist , could identify a heretofore unknown population of numerous , faint , hard x - ray sources that may be responsible for producing the @xmath7 kev diffuse emission .",

    "<S> this soft plasma is probably heated by supernovae , along with a small contribution from the winds of massive wolf - rayet and o stars . the radiative cooling rate of the soft plasma within the inner 20 pc of the galaxy could be balanced by 1% of the kinetic energy of one supernova every @xmath6 y. the hotter , @xmath7 kev component is more spatially uniform , with a surface brightness of @xmath8  erg @xmath3 s@xmath4 arcmin@xmath5   ( observed ; 28 )  kev . </S>",
    "<S> the intensity of the hard plasma is correlated with that of the soft , but they are probably only indirectly related , because neither supernova remnants nor wr / o stars are observed to produce thermal plasma hotter than @xmath9 kev . moreover </S>",
    "<S> , a @xmath7 kev plasma would be too hot to be bound to the galactic center , and therefore would form a slow wind or fountain of plasma . </S>",

    "<S> there is also no evidence that non - thermal mechanisms for producing the hard emission are operating , as the expected shifts in the line energies and ratios from their collisional equilibrium values are not observed . </S>",
