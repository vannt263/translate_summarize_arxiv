    "frequency - conversion mechanisms , such as optical parametric and four - wave mixing processes , have acted as a basic resource in the investigation of fundamental quantum phenomena over the last few decades .",
    "largely employed to produce squeezed and polarization - entangled photon states to test sub - poissonian statistics @xcite and bell s inequalities @xcite ,  such processes have deepened our understanding of radiation @xcite and its interaction with matter @xcite .",
    "apart from applications in fundamental physics , it has been conjectured that frequency conversions can improve the signal - to - noise ratio in optical communication @xcite and be used to measure gravitational waves through squeezed fields @xcite .",
    "recently , they have also been required within quantum information theory for the implementation of a nondeterministic controlled - not operation @xcite .    against this backdrop of the general usefulness of frequency conversions in the running - wave domain , several recent studies have been devoted to  mapping these mechanisms into two - mode cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite .",
    "parametric up- and down - conversions ( puc and pdc ) were accomplished through the dispersive interactions of a single three - level atom simultaneously with a classical driving field and a two - mode cavity .",
    "the pdc ( puc ) process follows from the ladder ( lambda ) configuration of atomic levels , in which the ground @xmath0 and excited @xmath1 states are coupled through an auxiliary intermediate ( more - excited ) level @xmath2 .",
    "the cavity modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 are tuned to the vicinity of the dipole - allowed transitions @xmath0",
    "@xmath5 @xmath2 and @xmath1 @xmath6 @xmath2 . the desired interaction between the modes @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath7 for pdc or @xmath8 for puc ,",
    "is accomplished by driving the dipole - forbidden atomic transition @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath1 out of resonance with a classical field . for the degenerate pdc process , where @xmath9 , the well - known interaction @xmath10   $ ] was first achieved in @xcite , and this may be used to squeeze an arbitrary state previously prepared in the cavity ; i.e. , to perform the squeezing operation @xmath11 in cavity qed ( @xmath12 being the squeeze operator ) .",
    "these achievements enhance prospects of quantum information manipulation and of fundamental tests of quantum theory in cavity qed .",
    "in fact , the engineered bilinear hamiltonians can be used to generate one - mode mesoscopic squeezed superpositions , two - mode entanglements , and two - mode squeezed vacuum states ( such the original epr state ) .",
    "motivated by these accomplishments @xcite , and simultaneously attempting to generalize and simplify these protocols , in the present letter we consider only a two - level rydberg atom in order to generate , in two - mode cavity qed , bilinear and quadratic hamiltonians similar to those describing puc and pdc .",
    "we also demonstrate how to generate , in one - mode cavity qed , the anti - jaynes - cummings ( ajc ) hamiltonian @xcite and a mixture of the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) and the ajc hamiltonians . we stress that all the previous schemes presented in literature to generate nonlinear hamiltonians consider the interaction between a cavity mode and an atom with at least three atomic levels .",
    "the present protocol , overcomes the difficulty of driving the dipole - forbidden atomic transition @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath1 , which sometimes requires a significant strength , as in the strong amplification regime defined in ref . @xcite .",
    "more importantly , with a two - level atom , long - lived circular rydberg states might be employable reducing the noise coming from the finite lifetimes of the atomic levels .",
    "( we stress that , to achieve puc and pdc with a three - level atomic configuration , at least one level can not be a long - lived circular rydberg state . )",
    "our results are derived from variations of the hamiltonian @xmath13 ( with @xmath14 ) , with    [ 1]@xmath15   { , } \\label{1b}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the atomic ground ( @xmath16 ) and excited ( @xmath17 ) states , with transition frequency @xmath18 , are coupled non - resonantly through the cavity modes of frequencies @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with coupling constants @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and detunings @xmath21 and @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "the dipole - allowed transition @xmath0 @xmath5 @xmath24 is also excited by two driving classical fields of frequencies @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with coupling constants @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and detunings @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the interaction picture ,",
    "the transformed hamiltonian is given by    @xmath31",
    "a single classical amplification field ( @xmath25 ) is required to accomplish these interactions . after writing the hamiltonian @xmath32 in this laser framework and defining a new basis for the atomic states @xmath33@xcite , under the assumption that @xmath34 @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , we proceed to the transformation @xmath38",
    "@xmath39   $ ] , which prepares the hamiltonian @xmath40 with @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , for a subsequent perturbation approximation .",
    "we finally obtain , up to the second order , the effective hamiltonian @xcite @xmath43 which will be analysed under three regimes of the classical amplification field : the weak ( @xmath44 @xmath45 ) , the intermediate ( @xmath46 ) and the strong ( @xmath47 ) amplification regimes .",
    "it is important to note from eq .",
    "( [ 1d ] ) that once the relation @xmath48 is satisfied for all the amplification regimes , there will be no transition between the atomic dressed states @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( even that there will be transitions between the bare states @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) .      from the above analysis , this interaction is achieved considering the energy diagram pictorially sketched in fig .",

    ", we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath56 , with    @xmath57    preparing the atomic state @xmath58 , we obtain through the unitary transformation @xmath59 , with @xmath60 , the engineered interaction    @xmath61    where the coupling parameters in the weak ( @xmath62 ) , intermediate ( @xmath63 ) and strong ( @xmath12 ) amplification regimes become @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , after adjusting the detuning @xmath67 such that @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "( for the intermediate amplification regime care must be take to avoid the equality @xmath71 . )",
    "we note that the strength of the coupling parameters obey the relation @xmath72 .",
    "the energy diagram leading to this interaction is sketched in fig .",
    "1(b ) , where @xmath74 @xmath22 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian becomes    @xmath75    again , preparing the atomic state @xmath58 we obtain , through the same steps leading to the interaction @xmath76 , the effective hamiltonian    @xmath77    where the phase @xmath78 can be made null only in the intermediate regime where the term in brackets , multiplied by @xmath79 , can be made of the order of the detuning @xmath80 .",
    "the coupling parameters @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 , follows without any need to adjust the detuning @xmath67 , since the condition @xmath84,@xmath85,@xmath86 is satisfied .",
    "again , the strength of the coupling parameters obey the relation @xmath87 . the time - dependent hamiltonian ( [ 3 ] ) can be treated through the invariants introduced by lewis and riesenfeld @xcite , as discussed in ref .",
    "otherwise , we may consider identical modes @xmath88 ( so that @xmath89 ) of two identical cavities disposed along perpendicular transversal axes and sharing the same two - level atom .",
    "as mentioned above , the engineered bilinear hamiltonians can be used for quantum state preparation in cavity qed . in refs .",
    "@xcite the interaction ( [ 2 ] ) was employed in a protocol for the preparation of the original einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) entanglement expanded in the fock representation .",
    "this interaction was also required to engineer the even and odd epr states defined in ref .",
    "the advantage of the protocol in @xcite over that in @xcite is the use of a intense classical amplification field , where the strength of the bilinear interactions between the cavity modes are considerably increased , at least by one order of magnitude , compared to the strength in @xcite .",
    "consequently , the atom - field interaction time required to obtain high - fidelity states can be considerably shorter ,  making the dissipative effects negligible .",
    "the present scheme , in turn , has the advantage over those in refs .",
    "@xcite , in that a two - level atom is able to generate both interactions , ( [ 2 ] ) and ( [ 3 ] ) , with coupling strengths comparable to those obtained in @xcite . therefore , apart from the benefit of a shorter interaction time , due to the strength of the coupling parameters @xmath90 and @xmath91 , here we get an additional advantage employing circular long - lived rydberg states .",
    "the same facilities apply to the squeezing hamiltonian engineered below .",
    "we finally mention that , following the reasoning in ref .",
    "@xcite , our engineered bilinear interactions can be considered to manipulate quantum information in cavity qed .",
    "to obtain the parametric amplification hamiltonian , we consider , as indicated in fig .",
    "2 , the atomic transition coupled to a single cavity mode ( @xmath92 ) , as well as two classical amplification fields , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , under the condition @xmath95 . starting from the interaction picture",
    "we obtain , after the unitary transformation @xmath96   $ ] and within the rotating wave approximation , the interaction@xmath97 where @xmath98 through the new basis @xmath99 it is straightforward to verify that , after another transformation @xmath100   $ ] , the interaction ( [ 3a ] ) becomes@xmath101 which is suitable for the derivation , under the assumption that @xmath102 , of the effective hamiltonian @xmath103 .",
    "finally , for the initial atomic state @xmath104 and adjusting @xmath105 , we obtain the engineered parametric amplification hamiltonian @xmath106 where @xmath107 , which allows the squeezing of any desired prepared cavity - field state .",
    "we note that the squeezing direction in phase space is controlled through the phase factor @xmath108 derived from a classical amplification field . with @xmath109",
    "we recover the atomic bases @xmath110 in that @xmath111 and @xmath112 . differently from the protocols with three - level atoms",
    "@xcite , where the squeezing interaction is engineered through degenerate atomic transitions , here a second amplification field on a single atomic transition is required to achieve the two - photon process .      in the running - wave domain",
    ", the squeezed states revealed the intrinsic quantum nature of light , together with direct evidence for an atom undergoing a quantum jump @xcite . the engineered interaction ( [ 4 ] )",
    "exposes a myriad of possible applications in cavity qed , ranging from the preparation of a set of squeezed states @xcite to the possibility of revealing the statistical properties of the electromagnetic field through its controlled interaction with atoms . beyond these applications , a particular squeezed superposition state ( sss ) can be prepared when adjusting @xmath113 , such that the hamiltonian governing the evolution of the atom - field state reads@xmath114   \\left (   \\sigma_{ee}-\\sigma_{gg}\\right )   \\mathrm{{. } } \\label{5}%\\ ] ] starting from the initial state @xmath115 , @xmath116  being a coherent state injected into the cavity , the generated sss is @xmath117 , where @xmath118  stands for the evolution operator associated with hamiltonian @xmath119 , with @xmath120 .",
    "it has been shown in ref.@xcite that the decoherence time of this particular sss  where both states composing the superposition exhibt the same squeezing direction  could be delayed to around the relaxation time of the cavity field .",
    "this remarkable result requires the engineering of absolute zero reservoirs composed by oscillators squeezed in a direction perpendicular to that of the superposition state .",
    "the reason behind this phenomenon is quite palpable : the injection of noise from the reservoir into the superposition state decreases as the degree of squeezing , of both the reservoir and the superposition states , increases .",
    "therefore , the present scheme is a crucial step towards the accomplishment of this specific program for protecting a quantum state . *  * ( we stress that the engineering of an ideally squeezed reservoir for a cavity mode , a task only partially achieved in ref .",
    "@xcite , has also been accomplished by our group @xcite . )",
    "to engineer the ajc model in cavity qed we start from the interaction @xmath121 that leads to the squeezing operator . considering @xmath109 and @xmath122",
    ", we obtain , within the rotating - wave approximation following from the condition @xmath123 , the desired interaction@xmath124 which has already been engineered in cavity qed with two - level @xcite or three - level atoms @xcite .  while in ref .",
    "@xcite the ajc interaction is achieved , with a single classical field , by adjusting the detuning between the cavity mode and the atomic transition , in the present scheme we adjust the detuning between the classical field @xmath26 and the atomic transition .",
