    "extraction of correct mass splittings between vector and pseudoscalar mesons remains a challenging problem in lattice qcd .",
    "while quenched lattice qcd has been unable to extract correct mass splittings @xcite , so far this problem persists even with full lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "one may thus ask whether lattice results for baryon mass splittings exhibit similar suppression compared to experimental numbers .",
    "so far , only a few lattice qcd results have been reported for heavy baryons @xcite , and there are only two works @xcite where heavy quarks are treated nonrelativistically . in this work",
    "we report heavy baryon results by using a nonrelativistic heavy quark action and an improved light quark action on anisotropic lattices .",
    "for light quarks we use a dirac - wilson action of the d234 type @xcite , which has been used previously and detailed in refs . @xcite .",
    "its leading classical errors are _ cubic _ in lattice spacing .",
    "the gauge action as well as the heavy quark nrqcd action is detailed in ref .",
    "the gauge action is tadpole improved and the leading classical error is _",
    "quartic _ in lattice spacing .",
    "the hamiltonian corresponding to the nrqcd action is complete to @xmath0 in the classical continuum limit .",
    "this work is done with two sets of quenched gauge configurations on anisotropic lattices ( lattice sizes @xmath1 and @xmath2 at @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively ) with a bare aspect ratio @xmath5 . for @xmath3",
    ", we use 720 configurations and for @xmath6 , the number of configurations is 442 . two sets of bare masses are used for heavy quarks while four sets of hopping parameters are used for light quarks and they are listed in table 1 . interpolating operators used here are same as in ref .",
    "@xcite , and correlation functions are calculated using both local and smeared ( gauge invariant smearing at the sink @xcite ) propagators .",
    "the time window to extract mass is chosen in a way such that the ending time is large and the fit is stable with variation of both starting and ending time by a few time steps .",
    "the fit corresponding to lowest @xmath7 is considered in this window - span .",
    "the temporal lattice spacing and correspondingly the scale is fixed by extracting the @xmath8-meson mass and the strange mass is fixed from the @xmath9-meson mass @xcite .",
    "the charm mass is fixed by extracting the @xmath10 mass , whereas @xmath11 mass is used to fix the bottom mass . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , light quark extrapolation is done by extrapolating the hadron masses as a function of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the pion mass .",

    "the mass spectrum and spin splittings of heavy quark baryons have been computed on anisotropic lattices using an nrqcd heavy quark action .",
    "results are summarized in table 2 , whereas in table 3 we have compared our results with those obtained by using a relativistic heavy quark ( d234 action , @xcite ) and experimental numbers ( where available ) .",
    "one can notice nrqcd results and d234 results are consistent with each other .",
    "results are also consistent with a previous nrqcd calculation @xcite .          in fig . 1",
    ", we plot meson and baryon spin splittings respectively .",
    "there is a clear suppression in meson sector ( top fig ) which is not present in baryon sector ( bottom fig ) .",
    "experimental measurement of spin splittings in bottom baryons as well as for doubly heavy baryons will be very useful to check if this is true indeed .",
