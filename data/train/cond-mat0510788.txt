    "the physical properties of layered molecular conductors are known to be influenced by electron - electron interactions .",
    "the comparative strength of the electronic correlations can be tuned by small modifications of the chemical composition of the crystals , that might result in different ground states for isostructural compounds .",
    "in addition , the behavior of the correlated systems depends essentially on the conduction - band filling @xcite ; while for half - filled systems the on - site correlations @xmath3 are of importance , the quarter - filled systems stay metallic at any values of @xmath3 , if the inter - site correlations @xmath4 .",
    "the importance of electronic correlations in 1/4-filled two - dimensional organic conductors was investigated for the @xmath5-(bedt - ttf)@xmath6@xmath7(scn)@xmath2 family@xcite , where a charge - order metal - insulator transition is observed at the temperature decrease .",
    "on the other hand , extensive theoretical studies were performed for the electronic correlations in 1/4-filled layered molecular metals close to the charge - order transition@xcite . here",
    "we present an optical study of 1/4 filled metals @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 ( @xmath8=nh@xmath2,rb ) , aimed on obtaining the effective mass and scattering rate of charge carriers , in order to compare them with theory and to distinguish between the electronic correlations and other factors defining their behavior .",
    "while in this family of compounds is known that superconductivity ( @xmath9  k ) competes with a density - wave ( @xmath10 - 10  k ) ground state , we argue that the properties at temperatures between 300 and 6  k are determined by the distinct ratios of inter - site coloumb repulsion @xmath11 to the bandwidth .",
    "the polarized reflectivity of single crystals of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 ( @xmath8=nh@xmath2 , rb ) was measured in the conducting plane along the main optical axes ( parallel and perpendicular to the stacks of bedt - ttf molecules ) in the frequency range between 50 and 6000  .",
    "the sample was cooled down to 6  k with a rate of 1  k / min ; spectra were taken at 300 , 200 , 150 , 100 , 50 and 6  k. in order to measure the absolute values of reflectivity , the sample was covered _ in situ _ with 100  nm and used as a reference ; this technique is described in ref .  [ 9 ] .    in agreement with the calculated higher values of transfer integrals between the stacks of bedt - ttf molecules@xcite ,",
    "the reflectivity is always higher in the direction of the @xmath12stacks .",
    "the reflectivity increases on cooling for both salts , as expected for metals . in the conductivity spectra",
    ", the wide finite - frequency electronic features are observed in addition to a comparatively narrow zero - frequency peak .",
    "furthermore , the narrow features in the 400 - 1600  range near the frequencies of the bedt - ttf intramolecular vibrations are known to be the @xmath13 vibrations of bedt - ttf activated by the electron - molecular vibrational coupling@xcite ; they are out of the scope of this paper .",

    "the arrows indicate the increase of drude spectral weight and the decrease of high - frequency features on cooling.,width=415 ]",
    "to follow the electronic spectral features we performed a drude - lorentz fit of the experimental data . in both polarizations",
    "the spectra of these compounds are described well by a drude peak , a maximum at about 1000   and an overdamped maximum at about 2400  .",
    "the high - frequency maximum can be distinguished in the whole temperature range ; the frequency does not change with temperature .",
    "the low - frequency maximum is separated from the dude - peak by a pseudogap only below @xmath15  k when the drude - peak becomes narrow enough , though the fit suggests that the maximum exists already at room temperature .",
    "on cooling down to 6  k this feature shifts from 1000 to 800  .",
    "-(bedt - ttf)@xmath6rbhg(scn)@xmath2 in e@xmath14stacks polarization .",
    "the arrows indicate a weak increase of drude spectral weight and the 1000  feature , and the decrease of the mid - infrared feature on cooling.,width=415 ]    the observed bands can not be interpreted as interband transitions , according to the band structure calculations@xcite , since they do not occur at known transition energies .",
    "we attribute the observed electronic features to the spectral weight shifted from the drude - peak to higher frequencies due to the influence of electronic correlations ; a similar interpretation was proposed for the spectra of @xmath5-phase compounds@xcite , where a very intense feature and a pseudogap at 300  was previously observed in the low temperature spectra of @xmath0-(bedt - ttf)@xmath16hg(scn)@xmath2 and interpreted as an indication of the fluctuating charge ordering@xcite .    in a one - band approximation ,",
    "these three electronic features together give us the total spectral weight@xcite @xmath17 received by the integration up to frequency @xmath18 .",
    "the minimum in the conductivity spectrum indicates the exhaustion of the band , i.e.  the band width @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the contraction of the crystal on cooling , which changes the size of the transfer integrals , results in a change of the total spectral weight , as estimated by the one - dimensional tight - binding approximation : @xmath20    the calculated temperature dependence of the transfer integrals@xcite shows a striking in - plane anisotropy : about a 7%  increase of the inter - stack transfer integrals is expected on cooling the crystals from 300 down to 4  k , while two of the three in - stack transfer integrals stay constant . in agreement with it ,",
    "the spectral weight estimated from our optical experiments does not change on cooling for the polarization @xmath21@xmath14stacks , but a considerable increase is observed in the @xmath12stacks direction : for the rb - compound it is about 10% , in agreement with the @xmath22 change , while the increase of the spectral weight for the nh@xmath2 compound amounts up to 30% , well above the expectations . in addition , the increase of the transfer integrals leads to a decrease of the @xmath23 ratio that defines the distribution of the spectral weight between the drude - like peak and high frequenies@xcite .",
    "indeed , a pronounced shift of the spectral weight from the mid - infrared to the zero - frequency peak is observed in the spectra of polarization @xmath12stacks .",
    "neither the total spectral weight , nor the hopping parameters change in the e@xmath14stacks direction .",
    "therefore , the observed shift of the spectral weight from the high - frequency features to the drude peak on cooling ( indicated by arrows in fig . 1 , 2 ) is consistent with predictions of the charge fluctuation scenario@xcite . a discussion of the main ingredients of this theory is revised in the following section .",
    "the simplest model to describe the relevant electronic properties of the @xmath0-type salts is a one band extended hubbard model at one - quarter filling on the square lattice .",
    "this model contains a kinetic energy scale given by the hopping , @xmath22 , the on - site coulomb repulsion , @xmath3 and the intersite coulomb repulsion , @xmath11 .",
    "this last coulomb repulsion accounts for the coulomb repulsion between two electrons on the two nearest - neighbors molecules . from quantum chemistry",
    "it is known that @xmath3 is larger than the bandwidth , @xmath24 whereas @xmath11 is comparable to the hopping and therefore can not be neglected .",
    "in fact the model contains a transition from a metal to a charge ordered state induced by @xmath11 , when @xmath25 ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) at zero temperature . close to the charge",
    "ordering transition it is found from exact diagionalization calculations that : ( i ) the drude weight is rapidly suppressed ; ( ii ) the optical spectral weight is redistributed so that a net shift from low frequencies into a mid - infrared band occurs ; ( iii ) a characteristic low frequency feature appears in the optical spectra as a consequence of the presence of the strong charge fluctuations occurring in the metallic phase close to the transition .    at non - zero temperatures ,",
    "exact diagionalization can not be used reliably due to the system size , and so one needs to rely on other theoretical methods .",
    "slave - boson , cpa ( coherent potential approximations ) and large-@xmath26 calculations on the extended hubbard model predict that sufficiently close to @xmath27 and within the metallic phase , increasing the temperature drives the system into the charge ordered phase .",
    "this reflects the unusual re - entrant character of the metal - charge ordered transition , which leads to an interesting temperature dependence of the electronic properties of the metal when being close to a checkerboard charge ordering transition at t=0 such as an increase in the electron effective mass with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "this behavior is different from the one found in a conventional metal in which increasing the temperature would tend to suppress the renormalization of the electrons due to their interaction with other electrons , phonons , etc , effectively decreasing their effective mass enhancement as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the fermi temperature of the metal .",
    "apart from the increasing effective mass with increasing temperature characteristic of the charge ordering transition , the scattering rate , @xmath30 behavior for @xmath31 becomes linear : @xmath32 for @xmath33 due to the onset of the charge fluctuations just like in the case of the interaction of electrons with other boson - like excitation such as phonons@xcite .",
    "the temperature @xmath34 defines the distance of the metal from the critical point at which the charge ordering transition occurs .",
    "hence , @xmath35 as @xmath36 . in a few words",
    ", @xmath34 is the characteristic energy scale describing the onset of the charge fluctuations .",
    "this energy scale is then very small : @xmath37 whenever the system is sufficiently close to the charge ordering transition .",
    "summarizing , the charge ordering scenario predicts for a metal close to the charge ordered phase ( @xmath38 ) : ( i ) a suppression of the coherent part of quasiparticles compared to the electrons of the non - interacting ( @xmath4 ) system , ( ii ) the destruction of the quasiparticles becoming more incoherent as the temperature is gradually increased above @xmath33 from @xmath39 , ( iii ) a linear dependence of the scattering rate : @xmath40 for @xmath33 .",
    "the slope of @xmath40 increases as the system is driven closer to the transition .",
    "indeed , this explains the experimentally observed decrease of the drude weight with increasing temperature in the spectra of e@xmath14stacks direction in these compounds .",
    "the effective mass of the charge carriers @xmath41 was calculated from the drude plasma frequency @xmath42 : @xmath43 .",
    "the observed decrease of the plasma frequency with temperature can either be caused by an enhancement of the effective mass or a decrease of the number of carriers .",
    "since the later one seems unlikely , we assume the carrier concentration to be constant with temperature and interpret the observed change of @xmath42 as an increase in the effective mass .",
    "for the rb compound @xmath44 increases from @xmath45 to @xmath46 and from @xmath47 to @xmath48 for the nh@xmath2 compound with increasing the temperature from 6 to 300 k is observed , in agreement with prediction ( ii ) of the charge fluctuating scenario .",
    "also , the temperature behavior of the drude scattering rate ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammad ] ) , though characterized by only six points , is distinctly linear with temperature down to about 50 k , while below this temperature it changes to a much slower dependence in agreement with prediction ( iii ) .",
    "the absolute yields of the scattering rate of the drude - component are higher in the rb compound , resulting in the presence of some spectral weight in the pseudogap at about 300 .",
    "in addition , it shows a much larger slope in the scattering rate , therefore we conclude from point ( iii ) that the rb compound closer is to the charge ordering transition than the nh@xmath2 salt .",
    "other explanations for the different scattering rates would be difficult since the compounds are isostructural and have very similar properties .",
    "for instance , a different number of defects in the two salts would give a constant shift in the values of scattering rate between the two compounds but would have difficulties in explaining the different observed slopes .",
    "phonons could also give changes in the temperature dependence however at much larger temperatures than the charge fluctuation scale , @xmath34 as the debye frequency is expected to be of the order @xmath29 .",
    "the magnitude of the characteristic temperature scale for the charge fluctuations , @xmath34 is theoretically of about @xmath49 . taking estimates for @xmath50 ev , the estimates for @xmath34 are of the right order of magnitude compared to the experiments .    stack direction for the nh@xmath2 and rb salt .",
    "@xmath34 is calculated assuming @xmath22=0.060 ev.,width=377 ]",
    "the optical investigations of @xmath0-bedt - ttf@xmath1hg(scn)@xmath2 ( m = nh@xmath2 rb ) compounds reveal the anisotropic behavior of the crystals upon lowering the temperature .",
    "perpendicular to the stacks , the total spectral weight increases on cooling with the increase of the overlap integrals @xmath22 , while the respective decrease of the @xmath23 ratio leads to the shift of the spectral weight from the finite - frequency features to the drude - peak .",
    "no increase of the total spectral weight is observed parallel to the stacks , as these transfer integrals do not change on cooling .",
    "we attribute the weak shift of the spectral weight and an increase of the effective mass with temperature to the re - entrant character of the charge ordering transition driven by the coulomb repulsion @xmath11 by which the critical @xmath27 is decreased with increasing temperature .",
    "the larger slope of the scattering rate of the charge carriers and the larger effective masses of the rb compound compared to nh@xmath2 , suggests that the rb salt is closer to the charge ordering transition than the nh@xmath2 salt .",
    "this conclusion is based on a comparison with the predictions of the properties of metals under the effect of charge fluctuations .",
