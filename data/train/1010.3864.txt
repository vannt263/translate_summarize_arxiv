    "rich galaxy clusters have long been the target of studies attempting to address the fundamental questions of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "they are ideal laboratories for this task as they harbour large numbers of galaxies distributed across a wide range in local density and at a common distance .",
    "the most direct route to answer these questions is to observe clusters at a range of redshifts and trace out the assembly history of their galaxy populations .",
    "unfortunately this method is observationally inefficient , requiring significant amounts of telescope time , and of course often relies on data of lower signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to conduct detailed analysis of the stellar populations of large samples of galaxies in nearby clusters and then use these characteristics as a function of their mass , environment or other key properties , to try and reconstruct their formation and evolutionary channels .",
    "the latter of the methods described above , which may be termed a type of galaxy archaeology , was pioneered by works which identified the environmental dependence of galaxy morphology in clusters @xcite , confirmed that red galaxies , predominately of early - type , follow a well - defined sequence in colour - magnitude space while later types occupy a blue cloud @xcite , and have analysed the scaling relations seen for early - type galaxies @xcite .    in a similar vein",
    ", the comparison of integrated photometric and spectroscopic observations of unresolved galaxies with stellar population models has become an increasingly valuable tool for galaxy archaeology . while it is possible",
    ", at least partially , to break the well known age - metallicity degeneracy by combining appropriate sets of broadband optical and near - infrared colours @xcite , the standard technique typically relies on using spectral line indices which target a small number of information - rich absorption features @xcite , with @xcite introducing the now de facto standard lick indices .",
    "in particular @xcite demonstrated how effective pairs of such indices can be at disentangling the effects of age and metallicity in unresolved optical spectra .    even prior to this seminal work ,",
    "evidence had been gathering that nearby early - type galaxies had non - solar @xmath4-element abundances @xcite , an effect that manifests itself as different metallic line indices implying different metallicities and ages for a given galaxy .",
    "typically this has been found to be more prevalent in giant early - type galaxies and is considered evidence for shorter star - formation episodes in more massive galaxies @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is driven by the enrichment history of the interstellar medium out of which the current generation of stars formed .",
    "on timescales @xmath8 1 gyr this is dominated by type ii supernova , yielding more @xmath4-elements ( normally traced via mg ) than fe relative to the solar neighbourhood , but on longer timescales by type ia supernova which redress the balance . with this in mind significant effort has recently been devoted to including non - solar alpha element abundance patterns in stellar population models @xcite .    at @xmath2 100 mpc coma is the nearest rich and dense galaxy cluster and so the stellar populations of its galaxies have been the subject of extensive study for some time .",
    "below we review the key findings of a selection of relevant studies on or involving coma members .    using multifibre spectroscopic observations of 125 early - type galaxies with -20.5 @xmath8 m@xmath9 @xmath8 -16 located in two fields , one centred on the cluster core and another @xmath2 40@xmath10 to the southwest",
    ", @xcite identified a number of galaxies with what they termed  abnormal \" spectra in the latter field . in this case",
    "they defined abnormal to refer to spectra that show signs of recent star formation and/or nuclear activity .",
    "they also note that these galaxies are closely associated with an area of enhanced x - ray emission , now generally accepted to be indicative of the ngc 4839 group merging with the main bulk of the cluster @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed the stellar population parameters of 115 early - type cluster members with gunn r @xmath8 15 , although only 71 galaxies in her sample had velocity dispersions and all relevant indices measured . using the stellar population models of @xcite she derived a relatively low median age of @xmath2 5 gyr with significant intrinsic scatter ( @xmath7 0.18 dex ) and found [ fe / h ] @xmath2 0.08 , again with sizable scatter ( @xmath7 0.19 ) .",
    "she also concluded that age and [ fe / h ] were not correlated with luminosity or velocity dispersion .",
    "however , strong correlations with these descriptors were found for [ mg / fe ] .",
    "the spectroscopic survey of @xcite observed 278 coma members ( 257 with no detectable emission by their criteria ) , across the exceptionally wide magnitude range of -20.5 @xmath8 m@xmath9 @xmath8 -14 , located in two 32.5 x 50.8 arcmin@xmath11 fields , one targeted on the cluster core and one on the ngc 4839 subgroup .",
    "they found that metallicity positively correlates with luminosity but with a substantial scatter and that , interestingly , the scatter increases for fainter galaxies . in addition",
    "they identify an age - metallicity anticorrelation in any given luminosity bin , although as they do not take into account correlated errors ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the strength of this conclusion is somewhat limited .",
    "further still , using the same dataset , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafer c02 ) find evidence for a cluster - centric radial gradient in the stellar populations of their sample galaxies .",
    "they interpret this trend as a variation in metallicity in the sense that galaxies in the cluster core are more metal rich than those in the outer regions .    contemporaneously with the poggianti et al .",
    "study , @xcite obtained spectroscopy for 87 bright early - type galaxies ( m@xmath9 @xmath8 -17 ) in the core of the cluster . using the @xcite models and a multiple hypothesis testing technique , he found this sample to have a sizable metallicity spread , -0.55 @xmath1 [ fe / h ] @xmath1 + 0.92 , but a uniform 8 gyr age of formation with an intrinsic scatter of @xmath7 0.3 dex ( 4 to 16 gyr ) .",
    "he identified no correlation between age and velocity dispersion but did find [ fe / h]-@xmath5 and [ mg / fe]-@xmath5 relations .",
    "more recently , studies such as those of @xcite and @xcite have included coma members in their high density samples when attempting to constrain the environmental dependence of galaxy stellar populations .",
    "the former report that all of the stellar population parameters they measure , age , total metallicity and [ @xmath4/fe ] , are correlated with velocity dispersion regardless of local density and that the ages of galaxies in low density environments appear systematically lower than those in high density regions . by contrast @xcite find a less well defined picture .",
    "only their low density sample has a significant metallicity-@xmath5 correlation when using mg@xmath12 to estimate metallicity , as opposed to a positive correlation regardless of metallicity indicator for their high density subset .",
    "even more interestingly they observe age-@xmath5 , or so - called  downsizing \" , relations for low density regions and the virgo cluster but not in their coma galaxies .",
    "finally they find no age - metallicity anticorrelation for their high density sample .",
    "* hereafter t08 ) conducted a detailed analysis of 12 early - type coma cluster members in the magnitude range -21.5 @xmath8 m@xmath9 @xmath8 -16.5 based on keck / lris spectra .",
    "they concluded that their sample is consistent with having a remarkably young uniform ssp - equivalent age of 5.2 @xmath7 0.2 gyr and find no indication of an age-@xmath5 relation , a result which they suggest is supported by the majority of previous work on the stellar populations of coma early - type galaxies .    in the most recent study , at the time of writing , focusing on the stellar populations of bright coma members , @xcite observed 74 early - type galaxies with -22 @xmath1 m@xmath13 @xmath1 -17.5 ( @xmath2 -20.5 @xmath1 m@xmath9 @xmath1 -16 ) in the cluster core .",
    "their sample spans the velocity dispersion range 30 @xmath1 @xmath5 @xmath1 260 km s@xmath14 , 32 galaxies having @xmath5 @xmath15 100 km s@xmath14 .",
    "due to large uncertainties in their derived ages they are unable to confirm an age-@xmath5 relation but find that on average lower @xmath5 galaxies are indeed younger with lower metallicity and [ @xmath4/fe ] than cluster members with higher velocity dispersions .    finally ,",
    "while somewhat fainter in luminosity coverage than this work , the most detailed study to date focusing primarily on coma dwarf galaxies is that of @xcite ( hereafter s08 ) and @xcite .",
    "they observed 89 red cluster members with -18.5 @xmath8 m@xmath9 @xmath8 -15.75 split across two fields , one targeting the cluster core and one a degree to the south - west of the cluster centre .",
    "they found evidence for a strong cluster - centric radial gradient in galaxy age with galaxies in the core typically having older ages than systems in the outer region .",
    "a similar trend is also reported for [ mg / fe ] , with stronger mg enhancement seen in the cluster core than the outer region , while no such correlation is observed for [ fe / h ] .",
    "as such , it is clear that even in this well studied cluster the stellar population parameters of its host galaxies and how they scale with other galaxy properties are still somewhat in debate . in this current work",
    "we aim to resolve many of the issues discussed above and to clarify the effects of velocity dispersion and environment on bright coma cluster members in as homogeneous a fashion as possible . to this end",
    "we employ spectroscopy from the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 @xcite and the up - to - date stellar population models of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter referred to as the schiavon models ) , which allow the determination of elemental abundance patterns in addition to ssp - equivalent age and metallicity .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly overview the sdss observations and detail our sample selection . in section 3",
    "we perform emission line detection and measure our galaxies velocity dispersions and absorption line indices . in section 4",
    "we derive and analyse their stellar population parameters as a function of environment and galaxy velocity dispersion . in section 5",
    "we discuss our findings and in section 6 we review our conclusions .",
    "the sdss uses a dedicated 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory with a large format mosaic ccd camera for imaging and a pair of fibre - fed double spectrographs each with 320 fibres .",
    "both spectrographs have a blue and red channel that when combined cover @xmath2 3800 - 9100   at a resolution of r @xmath16 1850 - 2200 ( for further details see * ? ? ?",
    "the spectra are flux calibrated by the sdss spectral reduction pipeline using 16 spectroscopic standards on each plate , colour selected to be f8 subdwarfs .",
    "the sdss fibre diameter of 3@xmath17 equates to 1.4 kpc at coma assuming h@xmath18 = 71 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath19 = 0.27 and @xmath20 = 0.73 @xcite .",
    "we adopt a distance modulus @xmath21 for coma .",
    "all spectroscopy for this work comes from the sdss main galaxy sample , the target selection of which is detailed in @xcite .",
    "briefly , sdss imaging is used initially for star - galaxy separation and then to measure an @xmath22-band petrosian magnitude and define a circular aperture containing half a galaxy s petrosian flux .",
    "the main galaxy sample then consists of galaxies with @xmath23 @xmath1 17.77 and mean surface - brightness @xmath24 @xmath1 24.5 mag arcsec@xmath25 with r@xmath26 @xmath27 19 , after correcting for galactic extinction .",
    "objects with @xmath28 @xmath27 15 are rejected to limit the effects of cross talk when extracting the spectra of neighbouring faint objects , as are targets that are flagged as saturated , bright or blended and not deblended by the photometric pipeline . for reference , applying the above constraints to the sdss photometric database we estimate @xmath2 96 % of galaxies in our coma field ( see below )",

    "black points are galaxies which did not meet our s / n cut or , in the case of detected emission , were not cleaned sufficiently ( see section [ emidetect ] ) .",
    "the black diamonds highlight galaxies which are significantly bluer than the majority of our non - emission sample , determined here by them having a ( g - r ) colour more than 3 times bluer than the rms scatter of an unweighted fit to the full non - emission sample at their luminosity .",
    "the black ringed galaxy , gmp 2946 , has a number of flags that indicate problems with its petrosian magnitude ( see text for details).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the rationale behind our sample selection is simple , we aim to include as many coma members as possible and extend the recent work of @xcite and @xcite to brighter magnitudes . to this end",
    "we include all galaxies with @xmath23 @xmath1 16 within 2@xmath29 ( @xmath2 3.3 mpc ) of our designated cluster centre at ra = 12:59:48 , dec = + 27:58:50 , which is approximately half way between ngc 4889 and ngc 4874 , that have spectroscopy in sdss dr7 .",
    "we note that all sdss photometric values quoted throughout the rest of this paper are petrosian magnitudes unless otherwise specified and have been corrected for galactic extinction and k - correction using the provided parameters from the sdss database .",
    "in addition we opt for an inclusive redshift cut of @xmath30 based on @xmath2 4@xmath5 limits of the cluster velocity dispersion from @xcite and taking coma to be at @xmath31 = 0.0231 .",
    "these criteria result in our sample containing 417 confirmed coma members .",
    "we note that a more conservative 3@xmath5 cut only removes six galaxies and does not significantly affect our results .",
    "our magnitude cut is set by a trade off between maximising sample size , and completeness , and obtaining galaxy spectra that have sufficient s / n ; in this case we opt for a median s / n per   @xmath15 20 between 4000 - 6000  , to suitably constrain stellar population parameters ( see section  [ paramerrors ] ) .",
    "effectively this amounts to a cut of @xmath28 @xmath8 18 , which results in @xmath2 87% ( 363 ) of our sample having the desired s / n . of course the majority of our incompleteness , due to our required s / n , occurs in the final 15.75 @xmath32 16.0 bin where we are @xmath2 44% complete .    in fig .",
