    "photon processes the entire momentum of the photon takes part in the hard subprocess with a parton from the proton whereas in resolved photon processes the photon acts as a source of partons and one of these enters the hard subprocess . by measuring inclusive dijet events ( two or more jets ) information on the structure of the real photon can be extracted . by also measuring the scattered electron ,",
    "information can be obtained on the evolution of this structure as a function of the virtuality of the photon , q@xmath0 .",
    "the fraction of the photon s four momentum which enters the hard subprocess at leading order , denoted by @xmath1 , is equal to unity for direct processes , and less than unity for resolved processes .",
    "experimentally it is not possible to measure @xmath1 directly . instead , an observable quantity @xmath2 is defined which is calculable and well - defined to all orders of perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath2 is the fraction of the photon momentum manifest in the two highest transverse energy jets and is defined by the equation @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the transverse energy of jet @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the pseudorapidity of the jet measured in the lab frame , and @xmath7 is the inelasticity of the event .",
    "`` direct enriched '' events are defined as being those with @xmath8 and `` resolved enriched '' events as those with @xmath9 .",
    "this value gives the optimal separation of the leading order direct and resolved event classes .",
    "the kinematic selection cuts made in order to examine the structure of the real photon are    * two or more jets ( @xmath10 clustering algorithm ) * q@xmath11 gev@xmath0 * @xmath12 gev , @xmath13 gev * @xmath14 * @xmath15    the advantages of using high @xmath16 dijets are that they provide a hard scale where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) is expected to work , the hadronisation corrections are small , and the effect of underlying events is small . given these assumptions , the data can be compared directly to nlo pqcd calculations without the need to simulate some hadronisation model .",
    "this analysis concentrates on the high @xmath17 region where the quark densities in the photon are not strongly constrained by @xmath18 experiments .",
    "the measured zeus data is compared to nlo pqcd calculations for three photon pdfs , grv - ho @xcite , afg - ho @xcite and gs96-ho @xcite .",

    "there is an excess in the data above theory for central jets ( 0 @xmath21 1 ) below an @xmath22 of 25  gev .",
    "the assumption that the hadronisation corrections are negligible is not true for backward jets ( -1 @xmath21 0 ) , so no conclusions are drawn about the backward region , rather the discrepancy between data and theory is ascribed to a theoretical uncertainty .",
    "figure [ eta_highy_both_32 ] shows the cross section for a narrower range in @xmath7 .",
    "this provides a better sensitivity to the photon structure since the cross section is no longer averaged over the broader @xmath7 range .",
    "there is an excess in the data seen for central ( 0 @xmath21 1 ) and forward ( 1 @xmath21 2 ) jets , both for the whole @xmath2 range and the high @xmath2 range .",
    "the excess in the data above theory for jets with @xmath23  gev and for central and forward rapidities suggests that the available photon pdf parametrisations , based on @xmath18 @xmath24 data , are too small in this kinematic regime .",
    "the kinematic selection cuts made for the analysis of virtual photons are      three different q@xmath0 regions are available for measurement .",
    "q@xmath30 gev@xmath0 corresponds to quasi - real photons , where the electron is not measured , and the large bulk of such events lead to a median q@xmath0 of 0.001 gev@xmath0 .",
    "zeus has a small angle electron detector for tagging events in the transition region between photoproduction and dis ( @xmath25 gev@xmath0 ) . for @xmath31 gev@xmath0 the electron",
    "is detected in the zeus main calorimeter .",
    "figure  [ plotb ] shows the ratio of the resolved to the direct dijet cross sections as a function of q@xmath0 . since some of the systematic uncertainties cancel in the ratio , this is a more precise measurement than an absolute differential cross section .",
    "the data fall with increasing q@xmath0 .",
    "this is compared to the dijet ratio obtained with herwig 5.9 @xcite using a photon pdf which does not evolve with q@xmath0 ( grv lo @xcite ) and one which does ( sas1d @xcite ) .",
    "the herwig ratio with grv lo is flat , while that obtained with sas 1d falls with increasing q@xmath0",
    ". therefore the fall of the ratio with q@xmath0 observed in the data indicates that the data require a virtual photon pdf which evolves with photon virtuality .",
    "the lepto 6.5.1 @xcite curve shows the prediction for leading order direct processes in dis only .",
    "note that this ratio is non - zero as may be understood given that lepto contains higher - order processes in the approximation of parton - showering and hadronization .",
    "the data approach this direct only limit , however resolved processes are still required in order to describe the data up to at least q@xmath0 = 4.5 gev@xmath0 ."
