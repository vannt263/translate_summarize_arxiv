    "quantum correlation , especially entanglement @xcite , is a key resource for quantum information processing , e.g. , quantum teleportation @xcite and quantum dense coding @xcite .",
    "performance in such protocols , quantified by the output fidelity of teleportation and the communication capacity of dense coding , respectively , can be used as an operational measure of entanglement .",
    "when entanglement is shared by more than two parties , we may look into the multipartite entanglement structure and its usefulness by selecting a few parties among all and investigating their performance in quantum protocols for all such selected subsystems .",
    "numerous studies have so far demonstrated that a monogamy relation is one of the fundamental properties of multipartite entanglement , that is , entanglement between some subsystems puts limitation on their correlation with the other parties .",

    "ever since quantum dense coding was first developed in qubit systems @xcite , the dense coding capacity has been derived for arbitrary finite - dimensional systems @xcite with arbitrary number of parties @xcite for discrete - variable systems . on the other hand ,",
    "there have been few studies on cv dense coding with a general gaussian state .",
    "the cv dense coding protocol was first proposed by braunstein and kimble @xcite in which a pure two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) state is employed as a quantum resource .",
    "a controlled dense coding was later developed @xcite , similar to the network quantum teleportation @xcite , in which a three - mode entangled state is prepared and information is transferred between two parties with the help of classical communication provided by a third party .",
    "we here study the dense coding protocol employing an arbitrary two - mode gaussian state .",
    "we then compare this two - mode scheme with two single - mode schemes , namely , the squeezed - state scheme known to be best among gaussian schemes and the number - state scheme known to be the ultimate optimal scheme achieving the holevo bound .",
    "we derive conditions to beat those two schemes , i.e. to detect two - mode gaussian states that can manifest quantum advantage in cv dense coding .",
    "these conditions can be expressed in terms of the variances of two correlated quadratures as @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the variances of @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively .",
