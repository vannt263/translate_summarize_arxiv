    "a folded flexible heavy chain is suspended from a rigid support by its two ends placed close together .",
    "one end is then released in the manner of a bungee fall , while the stationary arm gets longer .",
    "calkin and march have noted that the system is conservative , `` there being no dissipative mechanisms.''@xcite energy conservation allows them to describe the one - dimensional motion of the falling chain simply and transparently in the continuum limit where the link length goes to zero : as the chain falls , energy conservation concentrates the entire mechanical energy in the still falling arm .",
    "when the mass of the falling arm finally vanishes at the end of the fall , both its falling velocity @xmath0 and its falling acceleration diverge to infinity.@xcite this phenomenon of energy concentration is similar to that occurring in the crack of the whip . in the words of bragg@xcite , a shock `` wave runs down the cord and carries energy to the lash at the end , '' where the velocity diverges to infinity in the continuum limit@xcite .",
    "calkin and march@xcite went on to measure the falling motion of an actual chain 2 m long containing 81 links .",
    "they found that the physical chain does indeed fall faster than free fall , and that the continuum model accurately describes the experimental chain motion except near the end of the chain fall .",
    "their meansurement of the chain tension @xmath1 at the fixed support of the chain is particularly interesting .",
    "the theoretical chain tension given by the continuum model contains a term proportional to @xmath2 of the falling velocity .",
    "it therefore increases without limit as the theoretical value of @xmath0 becomes infinite at the end of the fall .",
    "calkin and march@xcite found that the experimental tension increases only to a maximum value of about 25@xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the total mass of the chain .",
    "this maximum tension is of course far in excess of the maximum value of only 2@xmath3 expected when the falling end is falling freely , thus demonstrating beyond doubt that the folded chain indeed falls faster than @xmath5 .",
    "we shall explain in sect.[sect : tension ] that it is the finite size of the link that prevents @xmath1 from going to the infinite value predicted by the continuum model .    in many older textbooks on mechanics,@xcite",
    "the falling arm is incorrectly described as freely falling and is brought to rest by inelastic impacts at the fold of the chain .",
    "the kinetic energy loss in a completely inelastic collision is real .",
    "it was first described by lazare carnot,@xcite father of the sadi carnot of thermodynamics .",
    "the effect is called carnot s energy loss or carnot s theorem in sommerfeld s book on mechanics.@xcite the effect of an impulse alone on a dynamical system was treated correctly by an additional term by lagrange.@xcite in contrast , hamel@xcite obtained the correct solution for the falling chain by assuming energy conservation .",
    "we shall show that energy conservation results because the carnot energy loss caused by a transferred mass absorbed by the receiving subchain is counterbalanced by the energy gained when the mass leaves the `` emitting '' subchain .",
    "the calkin - march observation@xcite that the folded chain falls faster than @xmath5 was subsequently confirmed experimentally by schagerl _",
    "et al._@xcite photographic evidence can also be found in ref .  .",
    "the correct solution of the motion of the falling folded chain by energy conservation has been included in some recent textbooks on classical dynamics.@xcite .",
    "schagerl _ et al._@xcite were unaware of the measurement of calkin and march.@xcite the results of their measurements@xcite came as a surprise to them because they had concluded by theoretical arguments that the chain fell only as fast as @xmath5 , and that the total mechanical energy was not conserved.@xcite in these earlier papers , the authors rejected hamel s energy conserving solution,@xcite and claimed that there was dissipation caused by the inelastic but momentum - conserving impacts at the fold of the chain .",
    "they justified their treatment by citing sommerfeld s use of carnot s energy loss in another falling chain problem,@xcite which we will describe in the following .",
    "the experimental observation@xcite that the free end of the falling folded chain falls faster than @xmath5 might have led the authors of ref .   to conclude that the motion of the falling chain is non - unique , because `` it is important to note that for the folded string itself there exist more solutions which fulfill the balance of linear momentum ( but do not conserve the mechanical energy).''@xcite this non - uniqueness is the paradox referred to in the title of their paper.@xcite    the conclusion that non - unique solutions exist is clearly untenable because whether the chain is energy - conserving or not , its equation of motion is a linear differential equation with a unique solution for a given set of initial conditions .",
    "hence the experimental observation@xcite of faster than @xmath5 fall proves that the motion can not be the freely falling , energy nonconserving one .",
    "thus there is no paradox .",
    "a review article by irschik and holl@xcite mentions the same erroneous interpretation that for the falling folded chain , momentum is conserved but mechanical energy is not conserved .",
    "these authors knew of the experimental work in ref .",
    "but not that of ref .  .",
    "in a previous paper on lagrange s equations , irschik and holl@xcite were puzzled by the result of ref .   because they thought that the string tension at the base of the falling arm ( @xmath6 in their eq .",
    "( 6.22 ) ) should vanish , and therefore the arm should fall freely .",
    "they realized that this conclusion is not consistent with the observation of ref .  .",
    "we shall show that the erroneous conclusion of energy loss comes from the neglect of the energy gained when the transferred mass at the fold of the chain leaves the falling arm .",
    "this energy gain is the time reverse of the carnot energy loss incurred when the transferred mass is received by the stationary arm of the folded chain .",
    "there is another falling chain problem for which the consensus is that the total mechanical energy is not conserved .",
    "the steady fall of a stationary chain resting on a table link by link through a hole in the table appears to have been first studied by arthur cayley in 1857.@xcite he treated the motion as a continuous - impact problem leading to a nonconservative system and a acceleration of @xmath7 .",
    "cayley s falling chain problem appears as problem i.7 of sommerfeld,@xcite where the connection to carnot s energy loss is explicitly stated .",
    "it can also be found in refs .  .",
    "note that problem 9 - 15 in ref",
    ".   has been rewritten in ref .   without any mention of energy loss . however , the solutions given in the instructor s manuals@xcite are identical .",
    "the only dissent we have found of this common consensus that energy is not conserved is in the recent paper by de sousa and rodrigues.@xcite they first describe the falling folded chain by using a newton equation for the two variable mass subchains that contains the gravitational force but no chain tension .",
    "they obtain the wrong or energy - nonconserving solution with acceleration @xmath8 .",
    "they then solve the problem of the chain falling from a resting heap in a different way by assuming energy conservation .",
    "this assumption yields the right solution , as we shall show in the following .",
    "their solution is the only correct solution we have been able to find in the literature for the chain falling from a heap on a table .    in sec .",
    "[ sect : massx ] we shall show specifically that the transfer of a link from the heap to the falling subchain is the same energy conserving process that operates in the falling folded chain , namely an exoergic mass emission followed by a counterbalancing endoergic mass absorption .",
    "we will see that cayley and others considered only half of a two - step mechanical process that is energy - conserving as a whole .    given the brief history of falling chains sketched here , it is interesting to determine unambiguously when a mechanical system such as a falling chain is energy conserving .",
    "the answer was already given in 1788 by lagrange.@xcite in modern terminology using the lagrangian @xmath9 and the hamiltonian @xmath10 , two conditions must be satisfied for the mechanical energy @xmath11 to be conserved : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "consequently @xmath14 as we shall discuss in in sec .  [ sect : e ]",
    ". we shall also write the condition @xmath12 in the original form given by lagrange,@xcite who referred to kinetic energies as `` live forces '' ( _ forces vives _ ) .",
    "these conditions are well known and can be found in most textbooks on analytical mechanics , but they have been too infrequently applied on actual physics problems .    to show explicitly how this energy conservation enters in the mass transfer between subchains , we begin in sec .  [",
    "sect : massx ] with the standard force equation of motion for a variable mass system@xcite . for the special case where no external forces act on these subchains ,",
    "we show explicitly that the mass transfer is made up of an exoergic mass emission followed by an endoergic mass absorption when the transferred mass sticks inelastically to the receiving arm .",
    "we also find that the complete process of mass transfer conserves mechanical energy when the transferred mass has the velocity given to it by lagrange s equation of motion . hence lagrange",
    "s formulation gives both the simplest and the most complete description of the motion of both falling chains .",
    "there is an important practical difference between the two falling chains , however .",
    "the link - by - link mass transfer of the falling folded chain is automatically guaranteed at the fold of the chain , but is difficult to realize for a real chain falling from a resting heap .",
    "the folded chain always falls in more or less the same way , but the motion of the resting heap depends on its geometry .",
    "more than one link at a time might be set into motion as the chain falls , and some of them might even be raised above the table before falling off it .",
    "these complications make it difficult to check the idealized theoretical result by an actual measurement .",
    "we therefore concentrate on the falling folded chain in the rest of the paper . in sec .",

    "we can obtain from eq .",
    "( [ lagrange ] ) lagrange s equation of motion for the falling folded chain : @xmath46 we can then verify by direct substitution that the energy - conserving solution ( [ v2 ] ) satisfies eq .",
    "( [ leom ] ) .",
    "equation   can also be solved directly for @xmath2 by using the identity @xmath47 to change it into a first - order inhomogeneous differential equation for @xmath48 .",
    "lagrange s equation ( [ leom ] ) is particularly helpful in understanding the problem conceptually because it uniquely defines the chain tension @xmath49 that acts upward on the bottom of the right arm at the point @xmath50 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bungee ] .",
    "this tension comes from the @xmath15 dependence of the kinetic energy and serves the important function of enforcing energy conservation .",
    "the mistake made in the erroneous energy - nonconserving solution is to omit this term .",
    "we shall explain in the next section why this tension points up and not down , as might be expected naively .",
    "it is interesting to apply our analysis to a chain falling from a resting heap on a table through a hole in it because this situation is even more transparent .",
    "let @xmath15 be the falling distance , now measured from the table .",
    "the falling chain is described by    @xmath51    where the subscript @xmath15 refers to the falling part of the chain of length @xmath15 . because the lagrangian @xmath52 is not explicitly time - dependent",
    ", we again find @xmath13 and a conservative system .",
    "energy conservation can be written in the form @xmath53 the resulting solution,@xcite @xmath54 shows that the acceleration of the falling chain is @xmath55 , not the value @xmath7 of cayley s energy - nonconserving chain .",
    "the reason for the difference can be seen in lagrange s equation of motion @xmath56 in the incorrect treatment , the downward tension @xmath57 that comes from the @xmath15 dependence of the kinetic energy of the falling chain is missing .    with or without the chain tension term",
    ", the differential equation   describes a system undergoing a constant acceleration @xmath58",
    ". hence @xmath59 .",
    "the differential equation can then be reduced term by term to the algebraic equation , @xmath60 a switching function @xmath61 or 0 has been added to the second term on the left in eq .  .",
    "hence the solution is @xmath62 for @xmath61 with the chain tension , and @xmath63 for @xmath64 without the chain tension .",
    "we see that the lagrangian approach gives a straightforward way of generating the correct equations of motion in a situation that is confusing .",
    "we now clarify how the falling chain transfers mass from one subchain to the other .",
    "assume that subchain 2 of mass @xmath65 and velocity @xmath66 transfers a small mass @xmath67 at velocity * u * to subchain 1 of mass @xmath68 and velocity @xmath69 .",
    "the transferred mass is related to the subchain masses as @xmath70 at the receiving subchain 1 , the initial and final momenta are    [ m1 ] @xmath71    where we have included the momentum of the transferred mass @xmath67 in the initial state , for the sake of notational simplicity .",
    "the total momentum change , @xmath72 on receiving the transferred mass @xmath67 can be associated with an impulse @xmath73 received from an external force @xmath74 this variable mass equation of motion holds whether or not the system is conservative .    in a similar way",
    ", we can show that subchain 2 on emitting the transferred mass experiences an external force @xmath75 note how these well - known `` rocket '' equations take the same form whether the rocket is discharging or absorbing masses . because the total chain mass @xmath76 is constant",
    ", the sum of these variable mass equations is just the simple equation @xmath77 for the center of mass of the entire chain .",
    "the internal forces due to mass transfer always cancel out for any choice of * u * when the total mass @xmath4 is constant.@xcite    the velocity * u * of the mass transfer is not arbitrary , however .",
    "it too is determined uniquely by the chain tension term in lagrange s equation of motion . for the falling folded chain , the second term on the left - hand side of eq.([leom ] )",
    "gives @xmath78 and for the chain falling from a resting heap , the second term on the left - hand side of eq.([leom2 ] ) gives @xmath79 thus @xmath80 for both falling chains .",
    "the two chains differ in that the falling folded chain has a fold in it , suggesting that the fold falling with the speed @xmath80 is the natural location of mass transfer . for the chain falling from a heap on a table , on the other hand , the mass transfer takes place at a table edge whether sharp or rounded , but it is not obvious what the velocity of the transferring link is at the moment of the transfer .",
    "the answer from lagrange s equation of motion is that it is also the mean velocity @xmath81 of the two subchains .",
    "we now show that this mean velocity for mass transfer is not accidental , but is required for energy conservation .",
    "to simplify the situation , consider a mass transfer that occurs instantaneously at the same height so that the gravitational force is not involved .",
    "momentum is then conserved at each subchain . for the receiving subchain ,",
    "momentum conservation gives @xmath82 , or @xmath83 the receiving process at subchain 1 is a totally inelastic collision that involves a kinetic energy change of @xmath84 to the leading order in @xmath85 . here",
    "the kinetic energy @xmath86 in the initial state includes the kinetic energy @xmath87 of the absorbed mass @xmath88 .",
    "the net change in kinetic energy is just carnot s energy loss.@xcite    at the emitting subchain 2 , momentum is also conserved , thus giving @xmath89 the resulting kinetic energy change can be shown to be @xmath90 again the final kinetic energy @xmath91 at subchain 2 includes the kinetic energy @xmath92 of the emitted mass @xmath67 .",
    "an examination of these results shows that the total change in the kinetic energy @xmath93 vanishes only when the mass @xmath94 is transferred at the mean velocity @xmath95 . in other words ,",
    "conservation of kinetic energy is enforced when @xmath96 has this mean value .",
    "the mass emission step is then the exact time reverse of the mass absorption step .",
    "hence the kinetic energy is conserved for the entire emission - absorption process .",
    "( the kinetic energy is also conserved for any * u * when @xmath97 , but this solution is of no interest in our problems . )",
    "conversely , because we already know that the falling chains are conservative systems , we can conclude that the mass transfer must have taken place elastically at the mean velocity @xmath95 even without actually examining lagrange s equation .",
    "thus knowledge of energy conservation alone allows us to conclude that cayley s assumption of inelastic impacts@xcite is incorrect .",
    "a related result occurs in elastic collisions where the internal forces are equal and opposite .",
    "as a result , `` the kinetic energy lost in compression balances exactly the kinetic energy gained in restitution .",
    "this is sometimes called the third theorem of carnot.''@xcite because we know that the falling chains are conservative systems , it follows that the mass transfer taken as a whole constitutes a totally elastic collision .",
    "one final point needs clarification . according to eq .",
    "( [ leom ] ) the fold in the chain exerts an upward tension @xmath98 on the right arm .",
    "the direction of this tension might appear counter - intuitive until it is realized that the rocket engine term @xmath99 on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ leom ] ) term can be moved to the left side , the force side , of the equation . in this position ,",
    "the term carries a positive sign and represents a downward force that dominates the up - pointing tension . when added to the force of gravity , these two extra forces together gives a net downward force that causes the downward acceleration to exceed @xmath5 .    for the chain falling from a heap ,",
    "the situation is upside down and a time reverse of the falling folded chain .",
    "the mass transfer occurs at the top where the chain falls down link by link into the moving arm .",
    "the signs of both the chain tension and the rocket engine term are opposite to those in the falling folded chain because the falling arm is gaining mass .",
    "the rocket engine term , @xmath100 , when moved to the left or force side of eq .",
    "( [ leom2 ] ) , dominates to give a net up - pointing braking force that prevents the falling chain from falling as fast as @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is the chain tension term that pulls the chain down with an acceleration greater than @xmath7 .",
    "the chain tension @xmath1 of the falling folded chain at the support s of fig .",
    "[ fig : bungee ] can be calculated in the one - dimensional continuum model from eqs .",

    "the result,@xcite @xmath102 is a positive monotonic function of @xmath43 that increases to @xmath103 as @xmath45 .",
    "calkin and march@xcite studied experimentally the tension @xmath1 of a linked chain with @xmath104 links .",
    "they measured a maximal tension of 25@xmath3 as the chain approached the bottom . to understand this result within a simple theoretical framework",
    ", we shall assume that the theoretical tension ( [ t ] ) of the ideal chain with @xmath105 holds until the last link remains standing upright .",
    "the chain tension at that moment is @xmath106 .",
    "the tip of the last link will next fall a distance of @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the link length .",
    "it does so by rotating about a pivot at the contact point between the last two links .",
    "this rotation can be separated into two steps : first a quarter turn to a horizontal position , and then a second quarter turn to the hanging position at the bottom of its travel . to keep the chain center of mass falling straight down , the lower part of the left arm sways sideways to some maximal displacement after the first quarter turn , and then sways back at the second quarter turn .",
    "this sideway motion will not change the vertical tension .    in the first quarter turn ,",
    "the falling chain tip is still above the pivot , meaning that fractions of the rotating link are still coming to rest against the left arm until the last link is horizontal .",
    "hence the theoretical tension ( [ t ] ) can be expected to hold until @xmath109 , where @xmath1 has almost doubled to 21.2@xmath3 .    in the second and final quarter turn",
    ", the chain tip is below the pivot .",
    "the speed of the chain tip continues to increase , but now only by a freely falling rotation .",
    "the main consequence of this final quarter turn is to convert the vertical velocity @xmath110 to a slightly larger horizontal velocity as the chain tip reaches the bottom . at that moment",
    ", the chain tension @xmath1 has increased by the weight @xmath111 of the last link . because this final increase is very small",
    ", our simple analysis yields a final result of about @xmath112 , in rough agreement with experiment .",
    "the final swing of the rotating link is easily reproduced by a falling chain made up of paper clips .",
    "we believe that the remaining discrepancy comes primarily from approximating the linear density @xmath113 of the chain as uniform when it is not .",
    "the calkin - march chain appears to be a common or standard link chain made up of straight interlinking oval links . at places where the links hook into each other , the linear density increases by at least a factor of two because all four sides of two links appear in cross section instead of the two sides of a single link . if we also count the bends of the links , we find a significant mass concentration at the linkages .",
    "some of this mass concentration at the linkage for the last link should be allowed to produce some tension before the last link falls down from the horizontal position .",
    "furthermore , this effect appears to be larger than any energy loss caused by possible slippage at the loose linkages of the chain .",
    "the observed maximum chain tension of @xmath114 can be reproduced at @xmath115 , an increase of 0.0019 from the theoretical value of @xmath116 .",
    "each link in the chain has an inside length of @xmath117 .",
    "hence the observed maximum tension is reproduced if we assume that an additional @xmath118 of the last link still produces tension according to the theoretical formula ( [ t ] ) after it falls through the horizontal position .",
    "we note that the link length used in the calkin - march experiment@xcite matches that of the lightest proof coil chain manufactured by the armstrong alar chain corporation,@xcite but that the armstrong chain is too heavy by a factor 1.75 .",
    "the match would be good if the material diameter , that is , the diameter of the metal loop in the link , is decreased from the armstrong chain value of @xmath119 to @xmath120 . for this estimated matter diameter @xmath121 , the extra length of @xmath118 needed to produce",
    "the additional tension is about 1.06@xmath121 .",
    "we leave it to the reader to determine if this is the correct way to analyze the discrepancy and if so , how the result of @xmath122 can be accounted for theoretically .",
    "our simple interpretation is consistent with the general features obtained in the numerical simulation of a falling folded chain by tomaszewski and pieranski.@xcite they separate a chain of length @xmath123 m into 51 links of uniform linear density joined by smooth hinges .",
    "they solve the 51 coupled lagrange s equations numerically .",
    "they find a maximum velocity of about 21.5 m/s when the last link is falling . in our interpretation",
    ", the maximum velocity is expected to be @xmath124 m/s , very close to the computed value .",
    "the numerical solution shows a significant amount of oscillation in the stationary left arm when the right arm is falling .",
    "this feature is not included in the simple one - dimensional treatment using only the falling distance @xmath15 .",
    "the loss of kinetic energy to oscillations in the left arm has the correct sign to account for the difference between the two theoretical maximal velocities .    in this connection",
    "we note that calkin and march@xcite did not report any dramatic left - arm oscillations in their falling folded chain .",
    "we also do not find them in a falling folded chain of paper clips . a falling ball - chain , on the other hand ,",
    "does show a wave - like vibration mostly in the lower half of the rebounding chain .",
    "this observed damping of the theoretical vibrations expected of the hinged - link model of ref .",
    "seems to suggest that the loose linkages in the physical chains do not transport energy readily to the transverse motion of the chain .",
    "for the idealized uniform and inextensible falling folded chain , we find its center of mass kinetic energy to be @xmath125 in the one - dimensional continuum model .",

    "this resting state too has a simple explanation that is worth repeating : the act of straightening can be visualized as a completely inelastic carnot collision in which the remaining mass @xmath137 of the right arm is transferred to the left arm of mass @xmath138 .",
    "momentum conservation in the laboratory requires that @xmath139 the resulting kinetic energy change in this totally inelastic collision is @xmath140 this analysis shows that in the limit @xmath141 when the right - arm mass vanishes , all its remaining kinetic energy @xmath142 is converted into the internal potential energy of the momentarily resting chain in a single inelastic collision . for a perfectly inextensible chain suspended from a rigid support , @xmath143 must vanish , which means that the appropriate @xmath138 must be infinite , including not only the finite mass of the left arm but also the infinite mass of the support .",
    "this description is not the end of the story for an actual falling folded chain .",
    "if the chain is an ideal spring , it will be stretched by an amount consistent with overall energy conservation as the final mass transfer takes place .",
    "this stored potential energy will be used to give the chain its kinetic energy on rebound . in actual chains the final rebound that follows carnot s energy loss",
    "should also appear , even though the rebound is not completely elastic .",
    "this grand finale is easily reproduced for a falling folded chain of paper clips .",
    "we conclude by paying homage to the genius of lagrange whose formulation of classical mechanics helps us to decide definitively if a mechanical system is conservative . we have found that lagrange s equation of motion contains a unique description of what happens when masses are transferred between the two parts of a falling chain , a description that actually enforces energy conservation in the falling chain .",

    "( 1788),@xcite lagrange discarded newton s geometrical approach and recast all of mechanics in algebraic form in terms of generalized coordinates whose motion satisfies a variational principle , the principle of virtual work .",
    "he emphasized in the preface that `` no figures will be found in this work  only algebraic operations  ' ' @xcite he was one of the greatest mathematicians of the 18th century , perhaps its greatest.@xcite truesdell , an admirer of euler , faults the lagrangian formulation for excessive abstractness that `` conceals the main conceptual problems of mechanics.''@xcite however we have seen in this paper how lagrange s method gives definitive answers with unmatched ease , clarity , and elegance .",
