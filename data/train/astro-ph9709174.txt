    "the angular size - redshift ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) relation for a cosmological population of standard rods is a powerful probe of the large - scale geometry of the universe . for a universe characterized by the friedmann - robertson - walker metric , with curvature arising from the energy density of ordinary matter , and possibly a cosmological constant , the angular size of a rod of intrinsic length @xmath13 , viewed at an angle @xmath14 to the line of sight",
    "is given by @xmath15 ( weinberg 1972 ) where @xmath16 is the angular - size distance , @xmath12 is the present value of the hubble constant , @xmath17 is the expansion scale factor in units of time , @xmath18 is the speed of light , @xmath19 is the present ratio of the matter density to the critical density , @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is the cosmological constant ) , and @xmath22 for closed , flat , and open geometries , respectively .",
    "contributions to the energy density arising from more exotic phenomena such as textures will affect the angular size in a straightforward manner , but are not considered here .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for deprojected rods ( @xmath23 ) with an intrinsic size of @xmath24 kpc ( @xmath25 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath26 mpc@xmath26 ) for three friedmann cosmologies : 1 ) an einstein de - sitter universe , with @xmath27 and @xmath28 , 2 ) a flat universe with @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and 3 ) a non - closed , matter - dominated universe with @xmath29 , @xmath31 ( we will hereafter refer to these as models 1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively ) . model 1 is , in effect , a limiting case of models 2 and 3 , and we do not consider models with @xmath32 .",
    "the particular values chosen for @xmath19 and @xmath33 in the figure are listed , and the curve for a static euclidean universe , with @xmath34 ( hereafter referred to simply as the euclidean model ) , is shown for comparison .",
    "the amplitudes of the friedmann curves are scaled by @xmath25 , while their shapes and , in particular , the location of the minimum in the angular size ( typically between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ) , depend on @xmath19 and @xmath33 . for randomly oriented rods",
    ", these curves actually define upper limits to the observed angular size distribution , since projection effects will scatter the observed sizes downward .",
    "note that for the conventional parameter values listed in figure 1 , the curves for the different friedmann models , particularly the underdense ( @xmath11 possibly @xmath37 ) models 2 and 3 , are fairly similar .    with the discovery of double - lobed radio galaxies and quasars , it was hoped that a standard rod had been found which could constitute a useful high - redshift sample for measuring the geometry of the universe",
    ". early work ( miley 1971 ; wardle & miley 1974 ; hooley 1978 ) revealed , however , that the upper limit to the @xmath0-@xmath1 data traced a euclidean curve , implying that some effect must be diminishing the apparent sizes of these objects at high redshift .",
    "subsequent studies ( kapahi 1985 ; singal 1988 ; barthel & miley 1988 ; kapahi 1989 ; onuora 1989 ; ubachukwu & onuora 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ; chyy & ziba 1993 , singal 1993 ) , looking at the variation of binned mean or median angular sizes as a function of redshift to compensate for projection effects , all confirmed that the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 data was strikingly consistent with a euclidean model .",
    "three main explanations have been proposed to account for this observation : 1 ) the characteristic length scale of double - lobed sources may change with cosmic epoch , presumably due to differences in the density of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) and/or changes in the energetics of the active galactic nuclei ( agn ) which power these sources",
    ". intrinsic size evolution of the form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 so that higher redshift objects are intrinsically smaller , would reconcile the data with friedmann models .",
    "2 ) since power , @xmath40 , and redshift are necessarily correlated in any flux - limited sample , usually approximated by @xmath41 , a negative correlation between power and intrinsic size , typically parameterized as @xmath4 , with @xmath42 , would give rise to an apparent correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath1 , given by @xmath43 , effectively mimicing size evolution . in general , effects 1 ) and 2 ) may both be present , giving rise to overall observed size evolution of the form @xmath44 , where @xmath45 ( ubachukwu 1995 ) .",
    "3 ) according to the unified model for radio sources , the classification of an object as a radio galaxy or a quasar depends only on its orientation , with quasars having inclinations within about @xmath46 of the line of sight , with a median inclination of @xmath47 , and radio galaxies being inclined roughly between @xmath46 and @xmath48 , with a median inclination of @xmath49 ( barthel 1989 ; lister 1994 ) .",
    "if the unified scheme is correct , then in studies which include both radio galaxies and quasars , the high - redshift population ( dominated by quasars ) would have systematically smaller mean angular sizes than the low - redshift population ( dominated by radio galaxies ) , making the universe appear more euclidean .",
    "a similar scheme has been proposed to unify the two classes of radio - loud quasars , the core - dominated and lobe - dominated quasars ( cdqs and ldqs ) ( orr & browne 1982 ) , assuming that only the radio flux from the compact core is relativistically beamed . in this model , the moderately beamed ldqs , with a median ratio of the core - to - lobe flux density , @xmath50 @xmath51 ,",
    "have a median inclination of @xmath52 to the line of sight , while the more strongly beamed cdqs , with a median @xmath50 @xmath53 , have a median inclination of @xmath54 ( hough & readhead 1989 ; ubachukwu 1996 ) .",
    "if the observed fraction of cdqs increases with redshift , as might be expected in a flux - limited sample , then even studies limited to quasar samples would also reveal a deficit of larger sources at higher redshifts .    while most previous studies agree that the observed data follow a euclidean trend , they disagree substantially as to what combination of the above effects is responsible .",
    "several authors find evidence for significant size evolution ( kapahi 1985 ; oort 1987 ; barthel & miley 1988 ; kapahi 1989 ; neeser 1995 ) , while others claim to find an @xmath13-@xmath40 correlation with little or no intrinsic size evolution ( hooley 1978 ; masson 1980 ; onuora 1991 ; chyy & ziba 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ) .",
    "moreover , there has been considerable disagreement as to whether the properties of radio galaxies and quasars follow similar trends .",
    "some authors find evidence for stronger size evolution in the double - lobed radio galaxy population ( onuora 1989 ; chyy & ziba 1993 ; singal 1993 ) than in the double - lobed quasar population , while several workers have found a negative @xmath13-@xmath40 correlation for quasars but a positive one for radio galaxies ( chyy & ziba 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ; singal 1993 ) .",
    "others have claimed to see identical trends in the two populations ( gopal - krishna & kulkarni 1992 ) and even to reconcile the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 data with friedmann cosmologies based on orientation effects within the unified scheme ( onuora 1991 ) .",
    "the lack of concordance among these previous results strongly suggests that the construction and analysis of samples of double - lobed objects has been dominated by systematic and/or selection effects which are unrelated to the intrinsic behavior of the sources .",
    "in fact , several investigations have traced the inconsistent results of various studies to such selection effects ( neeser 1995 ) or to different sample definitions ( nilsson 1993 ) .",
    "we believe that other substantive issues have not been properly incorporated into the study of the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for double - lobed sources and have also compromised the results .",
    "we summarize these issues below :    @xmath55 1 . in determining the morphological properties of double - lobed sources ,",
    "it is desirable to characterize each source using parameters that make no _ a priori _ assumptions about the source structure and are related as directly as possible to the measured data .",
    "the moments of the brightness distribution , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 represents two - dimensional , quasi - cartesian coordinates , form one such set of parameters ( burn & conway 1976 ) .",
    "in particular , the second moment , @xmath58^{1/2}$ ] , is a model - independent measure of the source size which , for sufficiently large sources ( 1/3 of the beam ) , is independent of the beam resolution ( condon 1988 ; coleman 1996 ) . for double - lobed sources , however , @xmath59 is an unstable diagnostic since it is a flux - weighted quantity ; two sources with identical lobe structures ( i.e. , apparent shapes , sizes , and lobe - lobe separation ) would yield a different value of @xmath59 a ) if one exhibited a significant core component ( e.g. , because it was an intrinsically large source with its core flux relativistically boosted by projection , as opposed to a smaller , de - projected source with the same apparent lobe properties but no detected core flux ) , b ) if the ratio of the lobe fluxes in the two sources differed , or c ) if the maps of the two source fields had different signal - to - noise properties .",
    "in addition , surveys with different flux sensitivities and limiting resolutions can yield different values of @xmath59 for the same source .",
    "the more commonly used measure of the angular size of double - lobed sources is the `` largest angular size '' ( las ) , typically taken to be either the maximum linear extent over which a given level of radio emission is detected , @xmath60 , or the peak - to - peak angular separation , @xmath61 . the former definition , however",
    ", is also a poor measure of size since it is highly sensitive to the details of the observation ; radio observations conducted with different instruments at different frequencies , with different flux sensitivities and beam widths , can yield drastically different values of @xmath60 for the same object .",
    "an example of this is illustrated in neeser ( 1993 ) . even within a given radio data set ,",
    "the measured value of @xmath60 for an arbitrary distribution of high - redshift , extended objects is highly susceptible to the effects of cosmological surface brightness dimming .",
    "for these reasons , many authors studying the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for double - lobed sources focus on fanaroff - riley type ii ( fr - ii ) objects ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) , which exhibit radio - bright hot - spots near the outer edges of the lobes . for these objects ,",
    "the peak - to - peak size is largely independent of the details of the observation , and thus provides a fairly robust measure of the angular size ( see  2 for further discussion ) .",
    "however , the peak positions , and thus peak - to - peak sizes , are typically derived from fitting a specific model ( usually gaussians ) to the brightness distribution of each source .",
    "fitting gaussians to the highly asymmetric , edge - brightened lobe components of fr - iis will necessarily return peak positions which are slightly closer to the central core , and thus _ underestimate _ the peak - to - peak angular size .",
    "the resulting fractional error in the angular size would be small for large sources , but may be appreciable for smaller sources where the resolved lobe size is comparable to the angular distance between lobes . for small enough sources , standard gaussian fitting routines may fit only one or two components to a source which clearly exhibits a more complicated morphology , and",
    "thus drastically underestimate @xmath61 .",
    "these effects would become most pronounced at higher redshifts ( @xmath62 ) , where the relative fraction of smaller sources is greatest ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) , and precisely where cosmological effects in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane become important , thus making the universe appear more euclidean at higher redshifts .",
    "it is preferable therefore to measure @xmath61 for fr - ii sources directly from the radio data of a single , high - resolution survey , rather than from multiple survey catalogs generated by model - specific fitting algorithms . despite these considerations ,",
    "most of the @xmath0-@xmath1 studies to date have , in fact , employed samples compiled from output catalogs of multiple radio surveys ( miley 1971 ; hooley 1978 ; singal 1988 ; kapahi 1989 ; nilsson 1993 ; singal 1993 ; neeser 1995 ) . a further danger in using data taken from multiple surveys",
    "is that such a study may selectively omit some sources altogether .",
    "for example , large , low - surface - brightness objects detected in a low - resolution sample may be resolved out in a deep , high - resolution sample , and a high - frequency sample will generally contain more compact sources than a low - frequency sample .",
    "the mixing of sources from different samples may thus destroy the consistency of the set required to measure the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "@xmath55 2 .",
    "the sizes of double - lobed sources are measured from radio data , but the redshift information is often obtained in an optically selected fashion .",
    "thus , constructing a @xmath0-@xmath1 diagram from quasar catalogs ( as all previous studies have done ) might mix radio - measured angular sizes with optically selected redshifts , and may introduce serious selection effects .",
    "though one may hope that the highly heterogeneous manner in which lists of quasar redshifts have been developed would `` wash out '' any such effects , it is easy to conceive of scenarios wherein the sizes of an optically selected subset of double - lobed radio objects could be systematically larger or smaller than the population as a whole .",
    "such a selection effect , if present , would operate even when using catalogs with complete optical identifications and redshift information . to eliminate this potential problem would require obtaining redshift information for a complete set of _ radio - selected _ double - lobed objects , but such a @xmath0-@xmath1 study has not been carried out to date .",
    "@xmath55 3 .",
    "for the purposes of studying cosmology using the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , double - lobed sources are chosen to the extent that they might represent a population of standard rods .",
    "it is clear , however , that a given double - lobed source does not maintain a fixed size , but rathers grows with time , over a period of roughly @xmath63@xmath64 yr ( gopal - krishna 1996 ) ( this growth is not to be confused with the intrinsic size evolution discussed above , which occurs over cosmological time frames and refers to evolution of the overall length scale characterizing these objects and not the growth in size of a given source ) .",
    "thus , when considering the angular sizes of these sources , those with smaller sizes will in general be a mixture of intrinsically smaller sources plus larger sources viewed in projection . moreover , many radio sources exhibit a core - jet structure which , if not well - resolved , can easily be mistaken for a small double - lobed morphology , and many small , double - lobed sources may not be sufficiently resolved for an accurate classification . to avoid potential confusion ,",
    "it is necessary to determine , for a given set of radio observations , the angular scale above which morphological classifications can be accurately determined",
    ". this scale will generally be significantly greater than the survey resolution limit .",
    "however , previous @xmath0-@xmath1 studies include angular sizes down to the survey resolution limits ( barthel & miley 1988 ; singal 1988 ; singal 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ; neeser 1995 ) , and are thus mixing true double - lobed sources of various sizes together with objects which may in fact be a different class of sources , and by using multiple surveys , are doing so in a highly non - uniform fashion .",
    "the resulting admixture of objects is not likely to yield a good approximation to a standard rod , and while interesting from the viewpoint of agn evolution , is not valid for cosmological studies .",
    "since the morphologies of objects with large angular sizes are less likely to be misclassified , this problem also becomes more severe at higher redshifts , where there is a greater fraction of smaller , less well - resolved sources .",
    "the wrongful inclusion of more smaller sources at higher redshifts would significantly _ decrease _ the mean angular size at these redshifts , again making the universe appear more euclidean .",
    "@xmath55 4 . another important consequence of finite survey resolution is that a constant angular resolution limit does not correspond to a constant minimum linear size , but rather one which varies with redshift ( cf .",
    "( [ angular size ] ) and figure 1 ) .",
    "thus , if all the @xmath0-@xmath1 data down to some limiting resolution are used , the resulting sample will not only mix sources with different intrinsic sizes ( due to the spread in the intrinsic size distribution ) , but will span different ranges of intrinsic sizes at different redshifts .",
    "this redshift - dependence of the intrinsic size distribution again undermines the consistency needed to define a cosmological population of standard rods .",
    "the vla first survey ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) is the most sensitive survey of its kind , and represents a valuable new tool for studying the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation . to date",
    ", the project has mapped @xmath65 square degrees of the north galactic cap at 1.4 ghz to a sensitivity of @xmath66 mjy with a @xmath67 fwhm gaussian beam , and has catalogued roughly 270,000 sources with subarcsecond positional accuracy . in this paper",
    "we investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for double - lobed quasars in the first survey .",
    "we construct a sample optimally suited for studying the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation , addressing the various problems and selection effects which may be present , and devise analytic methods to account for these (  2 ) . in section 3",
    ", we explore the relationships among the intrinsic properties of the sources , using both parametric and non - parametric methods , and find evidence , regardless of the chosen cosmological parameters , for a negative correlation between power and size , with @xmath68 which , coupled with the observed power - redshift correlation , gives rise to apparent size evolution with @xmath3 ; intrinsic size evolution is consistent with zero .",
    "we also find that a subsample can be defined for which @xmath18 is consistent with zero , implying that any observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation would be entirely due to cosmological effects .",
    "we find these results to be independent of orientation effects , though other evidence confirms that orientation effects are present and consistent with the predictions of the unified scheme for radio - loud agns . in section 4",
    ", we investigate the constraints that can be placed on cosmological parameters from the @xmath0-@xmath1 data and find that , contrary to past work , the observed data are less consistent with a euclidean model than with standard friedmann models .",
    "both underdense models yield @xmath8 , with 1@xmath9 intervals ranging from @xmath10 to 1.0 , and the @xmath6 subsample favors values near unity in these models .",
    "model 1 , with @xmath69 , provides a comparably good fit , and even appears slightly favored by the @xmath6 subsample , though these results are likely due to the reduced number of free parameters in this model .",
    "though all three friedmann models yield consistent values of @xmath11 , the data at present can not distinguish between different cosmological models with reasonable significance . as a consistency check on our analysis , we also investigate the values of @xmath12 implied by the data , based on assumptions about the intrinsic sizes of the sources , and find the results to be consistent with the range spanned by current estimates . in section 5",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss future prospects for such work .",
    "in the interest of maintaining a maximally homogeneous population of objects , we restrict our study of double - lobed sources to those identified as quasars , excluding objects classified as radio galaxies .",
    "we thus bypass the issue of whether the potentially different characteristics of these two kinds of objects , such as different mean orientations or power - size correlations , produce non - cosmological effects in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane .",
    "moreover , since all friedmann models approach a euclidean universe as @xmath70 ( see figure 1 ) , the low - redshift population ( dominated by radio galaxies ) carries less information about the cosmology .",
    "conversely , since many quasars are found at higher redshifts ( @xmath71 ) , where the predictions of different models exhibit different minima and begin to diverge significantly , their @xmath0-@xmath1 distribution is more sensitive to @xmath19 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition , we further restricted our sample to sources with @xmath72 , since , as mentioned in  1 , past work indicates that the properties of low-@xmath1 and high-@xmath1 radio sources exhibit different behaviors , with the cutoff occurring roughly at @xmath73 , beyond which quasars begin to dominate ( heckman 1992 ; he s 1995 ) .",
    "using the hewitt & burbidge ( 1993 ) , veron - cetty & veron ( 1996 ) and first bright qso survey ( gregg 1996 ; becker 1997 ) catalogs , we selected all @xmath72 quasars whose positions fell within the currently mapped area of the first survey .",
    "each of these was then inspected separately by a.b . and",
    "c.t.w . on the first radio maps to determine the radio morphology .",
    "we included in our sample only those sources where the quasar position fell near ( i.e. , within a few arcseconds of ) the center of an edge - brightened , double - lobed radio source . restricting the study to edge - brightened , fr - ii objects offers two main advantages .",
    "first , since the lobes have radio - bright hot spots , the measured peak - to - peak angular sizes are less sensitive to instrumental effects and cosmological surface brightness dimming ( neeser 1995 ) than are fr - i sources , whose lobe components fade gradually toward the edges .",
    "second , since the underlying mechanism that distinguishes fr - i and fr - ii sources is not well understood , restricting the analysis to a single type of object assures us that the @xmath0-@xmath1 data are not altered by non - cosmological effects which may arise from intrinsic differences between these objects .",
    "determining the radio morphology ( i.e. , fr - i , fr - ii , core - jet , etc . ) is relatively easy for sources significantly larger than the beam , but can be problematic for smaller sources , either because of the limited survey resolution , or because uncertainties in the optical positions of the quasars make it difficult to determine whether the radio peak corresponds to a core or a lobe .",
    "it is unlikely that fr - i sources would be misclassified as fr - iis ; cosmological surface brightness dimming would select against very faint fr - is with @xmath72 , and recent studies have shown that there is a real decline in the incidence of powerful fr - is with redshift ( with few having @xmath72 ) , while the number of fr - iis increases with redshift ( zirbel 1996 ) .",
    "following neeser ( 1995 ) , we classify smaller sources as fr - ii only if the quasar position is at the center of two comparable edge - brightened lobes , excluding sources which suggested a core - jet morphology , such as those where the quasar position falls much closer to one of the components , or those where one component is much brighter than the other .",
    "sources too small for an accurate morphological classification were omitted , thus introducing an effective size cutoff in the data , the significance of which is described in  2.3 .",
    "we excluded from our sample any sources with highly distorted or bent morphologies , whose apparent sizes have been severely influenced by asymmetric interaction with the igm .",
    "a total of 103 objects satisfied our selection criteria . for each object we measured the peak - to - peak angular size ,",
    "hereafter denoted simply by @xmath0 , directly from the first radio maps , so as to avoid any systematic underestimation of the sizes which could arise from using the peaks of the gaussian model fits .",
    "we also recorded the first flux density for each source component ; for components which are well - resolved , such as the compact core components or sufficiently small lobe components , the measured first fluxes are reliable .",
    "however , due to its high resolution , the first survey is prone to resolving out flux from extended sources , such as the radio lobes of larger fr - iis .",
    "thus we also measured , where possible , the 1.4 ghz flux densities for our sources from the nvss radio survey ( condon 1996 ) , which is currently mapping 82% of the celestial sphere at 1.4 ghz to a sensitivity of 2.5 mjy with @xmath74 fwhm resolution .",
    "any difference between the first and nvss fluxes for a given source was ascribed to the extended lobe components , so that the total flux density , @xmath75 , corresponds to the value measured by the nvss survey ( if available ) , while the core flux density , if any , is determined by the first measurement .",
    "many sources do not have a core component in the first catalog , either because none was detected , or , in the case of smaller sources , because the gaussian fitting algorithm did not generate a separate component for the core .",
    "the data for our sample are listed in table 1 . for comparative purposes",
    ", we also measured @xmath59 ( not shown ) for each source using both the first and nvss radio data .",
    "figure 2 shows a scatter plot of the @xmath0-@xmath1 data .",
    "the errors in the measured values of @xmath0 are typically @xmath76 , far less than the scatter in the angular sizes at any redshift . for graphical purposes ,",
    "we bin the data in redshift , both in equal intervals of @xmath77 ( which corresponds to equal time per bin in an einstein - de sitter universe ) and with roughly equal numbers per bin , and calculate both the mean values , @xmath78 , and median values , @xmath79 , together with the standard errors of the mean values , and median absolute deviations , respectively , for each bin .",
    "the results are shown in figures 3a  d , along with the curves from figure 1 , whose amplitudes ( corresponding to the mean or median intrinsic sizes ) have been scaled to provide a rough visual fit . before turning to a formal discussion of the results , we describe several important features of the data , and address in detail the aforementioned issues associated with properly defining and analyzing such a sample .",
    "@xmath55 1 .",
    "the most striking feature of the data is that , regardless of the binning details , the observed data seem to be more consistent with friedmann models than with a euclidean model .",
    "the friedmann curves shown are not the best - fit results , but are merely intended for qualitative reference .",
    "we defer the discussion of the best - fit values (  4 ) until after we have addressed the properties and analysis of the sample , including potential problems .",
    "it can immediately be seen , however , that while the data are generally consistent with curvature models , it is unlikely , given the uncertainties , that the current sample can distinguish with high significance between the different models .",
    "note that in each case , the data point of the first bin appears anomalously high .",
    "@xmath55 2 .",
    "since the radio data are derived entirely from one consistent data set ( with a single flux limit , beam width , and frequency ) , our sample does not suffer from the potential problems , described in  1 , associated with the mixing of different samples .",
    "@xmath55 3 .",
    "as expected , we find that for cases where the first and nvss flux measurements agree , the second moments derived from both survey maps generally agree to within the second moment errors ( provided that the source was larger about 1/3 the nvss beam , so that structure could be resolved ) ; for cases where the source registered little or no core flux and comparable lobe fluxes , the measured second moments agreed well with the peak - to - peak sizes listed in table 1 .",
    "however , in cases where an appreciable core flux is detected and/or the lobe - to - lobe flux ratio differs substantially from unity , the second moments tend to be systematically smaller than the peak - to - peak sizes , confirming that the peak - to - peak distance is indeed a more robust measure of size  using the second moments would have the undesirable effect of introducing or strengthening a power - size anti - correlation in the data . for sources larger than @xmath80 , the measured peak - to - peak sizes agreed closely with those obtained using the model gaussian fits , as expected .",
    "@xmath55 4 .",
    "in any flux - limited survey there is the possibility that large , low surface brightness objects could be resolved out .",
    "the first survey is sensitive to structure out to @xmath81 , and it may be asked whether larger double - lobed sources , whose lobes might equal or exceed this angular size , might be missing from our sample .",
    "since the hot spots of fr - ii objects are , by definition , high surface brightness features , and the first survey measures peak fluxes down to @xmath66 mjy , it is highly unlikely that these sources would be missed altogether ; only very large , low surface brightness objects can remain undetected , and such sources would not correspond to fr - iis in our chosen redshift range . if such objects did exist , they would presumably , due to their large sizes and integrated fluxes , be known radio quasars detected by previous surveys , and should certainly be detected by the nvss survey . thus , to explore this issue in a complete fashion , we individually compared the nvss and first radio maps for every previously known radio - active quasar in the veron - cetty & veron ( 1996 ) catalog falling within the first survey , searching for double - lobed radio sources with sizes up to @xmath82 which might have been missed by first .",
    "as expected , we find not a single instance of a large , double - lobed quasar , with @xmath72 , detected by nvss and not by first , indicating that there is no instrumental cutoff at the upper end of the observed angular sizes in our sample .",
    "this is confirmed by the fact that , within our chosen redshift range , the upper limit of our @xmath0-@xmath1 data agrees closely with that of other samples drawn from less sensitive surveys , such as 3c and 4c ( hooley 1978 ; nilsson 1993 ) .",
    "@xmath55 5 . to confirm that our selected sample is not contaminated by fr - i sources",
    ", we calculate the intrinsic 1.4 ghz power , @xmath83 of each double - lobed quasar , where @xmath84 is the 1.4 ghz flux density and @xmath85 is the radio spectral index ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "we assume standard values of @xmath87 for any core components , @xmath88 for lobe components ( e.g. , gopal - krishna & kulkarni 1992 ; rector , stocke , & ellingson 1995 ) , and take @xmath40 to be the total core+lobe power . for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , we find a lower limit of @xmath91 w hz@xmath26 for our sample , very near the observed break which separates fr - iis from the lower - power fr - is for this choice of cosmological parameters ( fanaroff & riley 1974 , neeser 1995 , rector , stocke , & ellingson 1995 ) .",
    "all but 9 sources have intrinsic powers in the range @xmath92 w hz@xmath93 w hz@xmath26 , confirming that our sample is indeed comprised of fr - iis .",
    "@xmath55 6 .",
    "another advantage of the flux sensitivity of the first survey is that our sample includes sources out to a redshift of @xmath94 , significantly higher than the redshifts at which the minima in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves typically occur for different friedmann models .",
    "this is in contrast to some previous work , which used samples containing significant numbers of sources only to @xmath95 ( oort 1987 ; kapahi 1989 ) , where roughly euclidean behavior is expected ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "however , since @xmath0 and @xmath1 are obviously correlated in our sample , with an expected upper limit to the correlation , and we lack complete redshift information for sources in the first survey , we must restrict the test to the range in @xmath0 ( @xmath96 ) below which sources in our sample appear roughly uniformly at every redshift , in order to perform a fair comparison . in the range @xmath97 ( the origin of the lower limit",
    "is discussed below ) there are currently 13,664 objects in the first survey which are classified as true double - lobed sources at the 95% confidence level , based on morphology , positional and flux information ( buchalter 1997 ) and two - point correlation analysis ( cress 1996 ) .",
    "a k - s test shows that the null hypothesis  that our size - restricted subsample is drawn from this larger set  can only be rejected only at the 51% level ; i.e. , it fails to discriminate between the two distributions at the 1@xmath9 level .",
    "in addition , since 47% of the extended ( @xmath98 ) sources in the first survey have measured fluxes below 3 mjy , but only 5 of our 103 sources have either lobe flux in this range , we further restrict the k - s test to sources whose individual lobe fluxes are @xmath99 mjy . in this case",
    "we find that the null hypothesis that our remaining subsample is drawn from the 10,521 such sources in the survey can only be rejected only at the 30% level .",
    "furthermore , it is estimated that the median redshift of the first survey is @xmath100 ( cress & kamionkowski 1997 ) while the median redshift of our sample is 0.98 .",
    "this evidence , taken together , indicates that the two populations have similar distributions , and therefore that our optically selected sample ( i.e. , fr - ii quasars with measured redshifts ) is fairly representative of double - lobed radio sources as a whole .",

    "for example , if the fraction of cdqs increases with redshift then the angular sizes of our sources at higher redshifts would be depressed relative to the cosmological predictions , since the cdqs are projected more closely to the line of sight . to investigate this issue , we perform a k - s test to compare the redshift distributions of these two classes of quasars in our sample .",
    "since the observed median values of @xmath50 for these objects are @xmath101 and @xmath102 ( ubachukwu 1996 ) , we classify our sources using the geometric mean of @xmath103 for the critical value .",

    ", the first survey can detect extended structure down to @xmath109 ( white 1997 ) .",
    "however , due to the survey resolution limit , uncertainties in the quasar optical positions , and variations in the morphologies of double - lobed objects , sources with @xmath110 could not be assigned an accurate morphological classification .",
    "thus , based on inspection of numerous first radio maps , we have introduced an effective cutoff in the data at @xmath111 , illustrated by the thin dashed line in figure 2 . in terms of defining a population of standard rods , it is , in fact , _ desirable _ to have such a cutoff , in order to eliminate the possibility of including so - called core - jet , diffuse , cometary , and other types of extended radio sources which may be mistaken for double - lobed objects at low resolution ( cf .",
    "we now outline a self - consistent method for incorporating this cutoff into the analysis .",

    "in general , the intrinsic sizes will range up to some maximum value , @xmath112 , defined by the upper envelope to the observed angular sizes , and above which there simply are no objects ( see figure 2 ) . determining the exact value of @xmath112 from a given @xmath0-@xmath1 data set would require assumptions about the cosmology ( see eq .",
    "( [ angular size ] ) ) , but the actual value is irrelevant for the purposes of this discussion and no such assumptions need be made .",
    "the projection angles will range between 0 and some upper limit @xmath113 , which for a randomly distributed population would correspond to @xmath48 , but in the context of the unified scheme would correspond to a value of roughly @xmath46 ( barthel 1989 ; lister 1994 ) .",
    "the accessible portion of the parameter space is then defined by the largest bold rectangle in figure 4 .",
    "there will also in general be some probability density along each axis , given by @xmath114 and @xmath115 ( assumed to be independent ) , which will determine the forms of the distributions . for a distribution of randomly oriented rods",
    ", it can be seen from simple geometric arguments that @xmath116 ( harwit 1988 ) ; @xmath114 is still a matter of theoretical and observational debate .",
    "since we are interested in defining a uniform population of objects with true double - lobed structure , it makes sense to impose an effective resolution cutoff at the angular scale for which morphologies are well - determined .",
    "however , since a constant minimum resolvable angular size does not translate into a constant minimum intrinsic linear size , the effect of this cutoff ( or simply of the survey resolution limit in general ) will be to introduce a redshift - dependence to the intrinsic size distribution .",
    "it is desirable therefore to impose a minimum intrinsic size , @xmath117 , such that , for a given survey resolution , restricting a sample to sizes @xmath118 both avoids potential contamination by misclassified sources _ and _ preserves the same range of observed sizes at every redshift .",
    "it may be expected that the average size of this more homogeneous population ( true double - lobed objects with @xmath119 ) is a more suitable measure of a standard rod than that of a distribution which includes objects with structure down to the resolution limits of various surveys , probing different intrinsic length scales , and possibly mixing different classes of sources .",
    "since the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation always exhibits a minimum in friedmann models , when fitting a given cosmological model to the data , one can define a subsample in which all objects have @xmath118 by aligning the minimum of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve for that particular model with the smallest observable _ angular _ size at which morphologies can be accurately determined , and including only points above this curve .",
    "the choice of @xmath117 is , then , determined by whatever value achieves this alignment for the given model , though the actual value is immaterial .",
    "the value of @xmath112 can be determined by finding the highest amplitude @xmath0-@xmath1 curve for the given model which still passes through a data point in the sample and thus defines an upper envelope to the angular sizes .",
    "the sample so defined will include maximally deprojected objects of intrinsic size @xmath117 , and larger objects viewed down to some projection angle given by the bold , dot - dashed curve in figure 4 ( for example , objects with size @xmath112 can be seen projected down to an angle of @xmath120 ) .",
    "for the purposes of this analysis , however , one is free to examine only those sources with @xmath121 , where @xmath122 can assume any value between @xmath117 and @xmath112 ; i.e. , the discussion presented here is valid for any choice of an upper envelope to the data which is lower than the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve corresponding to @xmath112 and above that corresponding to @xmath117 , for the assumed model . for an arbitrary choice of @xmath122 , which we denote by @xmath123 , the sample will include maximally deprojected objects of intrinsic size @xmath117 , objects with @xmath124 viewed from @xmath125 down to some projection angle given by the bold , dot - dashed curve , and objects with @xmath126 with projection angles between the dashed and dot - dashed bold curves .",
    "the objects in the sample will thus be located either in the combined area of regions @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( hereafter denoted by @xmath129 ) in figure 4 ( for an upper envelope corresponding to @xmath130 ) , or simply in region @xmath127 ( for an upper envelope corresponding to @xmath131 ) , and the observed angular sizes , @xmath0 , for a given friedmann model correspond to the distribution of @xmath132 in these regions .",
    "due to projection effects , some fraction of the objects with intrinsic sizes larger than @xmath117 will be missed ( corresponding to region @xmath133 the figure ) .",
    "if @xmath114 and @xmath115 were known , it would be a simple matter to calculate the fraction of objects in region @xmath133 as well as the @xmath134 distribution in this region .",
    "however , if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are independent of redshift , then for a given data set , the best - fit values of @xmath11 and @xmath33 for a particular model can be uniquely determined by the observed @xmath0 distribution in any given region , and are independent of @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and the intrinsic size limits given by @xmath117 , @xmath112 , and @xmath125 .",
    "in other words , as long as the distribution of intrinsic projected sizes , @xmath134 , is not sensitive to redshift , the actual values of @xmath117 , @xmath112 , and @xmath125 can only change the amplitude of the best - fit curve to the @xmath0-@xmath1 data ( cf .",
    "( [ angular size ] ) ) , not its shape .",
    "in contrast , a determination of @xmath12 would require specific assumptions about these quantities and about @xmath114 .",
    "moreover , even if the @xmath134 distribution does vary with redshift ( e.g. , because of some combination of size evolution , a power - size correlation , or orientation effects ) , @xmath11 and @xmath33 can still be determined to the extent that this variation can be modelled and corrected for in the data .",
    "the question of whether or not @xmath134 is independent of redshift is addressed quantitatively in the following section .",
    "note , however , that figure 3 effectively demonstrates that any relation between @xmath134 and @xmath1 can not be strong ; these graphs include all the observed data , without incorporating any of the above size considerations , and are already seen to be fairly consistent with the conventional curvature models , without invoking any redshift evolution of the apparent sizes .",
    "we will hereafter use the term `` intrinsic size evolution '' to denote the case where the intrinsic projected sizes , @xmath135 have a direct correlation with redshift ( e.g. , if @xmath136 with @xmath137 , or if @xmath14 and @xmath1 are directly correlated ) , and `` apparent size evolution '' to denote the case where @xmath138 and @xmath1 are directly and/or indirectly correlated .",
    "thus , apparent size evolution can arise from intrinsic size evolution , but also from other effects , such as an @xmath13-@xmath40 correlation coupled with a @xmath40-@xmath1 correlation .",
    "in general , various possible correlations may exist between @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath40 , and @xmath1 , and we investigate these in detail in  3 .",
    "however , only those which give rise to apparent size evolution  an observed correlation between @xmath138 and @xmath1can affect the determination of cosmological parameters from a given data set .    in the scenario we have presented ,",
    "the best - fit cosmological parameters to a given data set can be found by exploring parameter space in the following fashion : 1 ) assume a particular cosmological model ( we use the word `` model '' as in  1 to refer to the overall geometry and not the particular values chosen for @xmath11 and @xmath33 ) .",
    "2 ) adopt trial values for the relevant density parameters in that model .",
    "3 ) find the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve arising from these values ( as in figure 1 ) and align the minimum value of this curve with the constant value of the effective angular size cutoff determined for the survey in question .",
    "denote this curve by @xmath139 .",
    "this then fixes the minimum intrinsic size for which accurately determined morphologies in the sample are assured . in a similar manner , adjust the amplitude of the trial @xmath0-@xmath1 curve so that it lies at some desired level above @xmath139 , and denote this curve by @xmath140 .",
    "for example , to include all the data above @xmath139 , one would choose @xmath140 so that it defines the upper envelope to the observed angular sizes ( corresponding to @xmath141 ) .",
    "4 ) beginning with all the data above the effective cutoff , eliminate any data in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane with @xmath142 or @xmath143 thus ensuring that the remaining sources all have intrinsic sizes between @xmath117 and @xmath122 .",
    "this step assures that the intrinsic size limits have been imposed in a self - consistent manner .",
    "5 ) using the remaining data , perform a @xmath144 goodness - of - fit test to determine the best - fit values of the remaining free parameters in the test model ( e.g. , amplitude and size evolution parameter ) , and assess how well the output parameters for the assumed model fit the resulting @xmath0-@xmath1 data .",
    "the entire procedure can then repeated so as to span the range of density parameters appropriate to the assumed model , as well as to explore different models . conducting the analysis in this fashion both defines a sample whose mean size is more akin to a standard rod and accounts for the limited survey resolution in a self - consistent manner .",
    "correlations among the properties of fr - ii quasars have important implications for understanding the characteristics of the host active galactic nuclei and the evolution of the intergalactic medium , as well as for determining the best - fit cosmological parameters from classical cosmological tests such as the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation .",
    "these correlations must be considered in detail if these objects are to be used as probes of the geometry of the universe .",
    "thus , before addressing cosmological issues , we explore the relationships between the intrinsic properties of the sources in our sample , by spanning the entire assumed range of cosmological parameter values and testing for correlations among the intrinsic properties in each case . for a given set of cosmological parameters ,",
    "one can calculate respectively the intrinsic power and projected linear size , @xmath145 of each double - lobed quasar , where we again assume a spectral index of @xmath87 for any core components , @xmath88 for lobe components and take @xmath40 to be the total core+lobe power .",
    "if we assume relationships between @xmath40 , @xmath13 , and @xmath1 of the form @xmath146 as in  1 , we can then determine the best - fit values of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 .",
    "in practice , it is straightforward to fit for the @xmath40-@xmath1 and @xmath13-@xmath40 correlations , since these are expected to operate independently of the third variable ; a @xmath40-@xmath1 correlation should arise from the flux - limited nature of the survey and an @xmath13-@xmath40 correlation should operate over the lifetime of the sources , which is far less than the cosmological timescales spanned by the @xmath1 distribution . any observed @xmath13-@xmath1 correlation , however , may be due to the separate correlations of @xmath13 and @xmath1 with @xmath40 and not to intrinsic size evolution . to address this possibility ,",
    "previous authors have investigated the @xmath13-@xmath1 correlation for sources within relatively narrow ranges of intrinsic power , so as to minimize the effect of any dependence on @xmath40 ( hooley 1978 ; kapahi 1985 ; singal 1988 ; barthel & miley 1988 ; singal 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ) . however , according to relations ( [ prop1])-([prop3 ] ) , the combined effects of intrinsic size evolution and a power - size correlation will result in an overall apparent @xmath13-@xmath1 correlation of the form @xmath150 , where @xmath151 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath18 for a given model follows directly from the data and , together with the derived values of @xmath149 and @xmath148 , one can arrive at a value for @xmath147 .",
    "we explore models 1 ( @xmath69 ) , 2 , and 3 , adopting values of @xmath11 from 0.01 to 0.99 inclusive , in intervals of 0.01 , for models 2 and 3 ( @xmath25 merely fixes the constants of proportionality in relations ( [ prop1])-([prop3 ] ) and has no effect on @xmath149 , @xmath148 , or @xmath147 , and all 3 models obviously yield the same results for @xmath7 ) , for a total of 199 possible scenarios . for each scenario , we align the corresponding @xmath0-@xmath1 curve with the effective cutoff at @xmath111 and include only data above this curve ( denoted by @xmath139 ) , and below some upper curve ( denoted by @xmath140 ) which may correspond to the true upper envelope to the data , but can in general assume any lower amplitude still above that of @xmath139 , as outlined above . for the remaining data , we compute , using five roughly equally populated bins , the mean intrinsic projected sizes , @xmath152 , in bins of @xmath40 , @xmath152 in bins of @xmath1 , and @xmath153 in bins of @xmath1 , together with the standard errors in these quantities , and use a @xmath144 minimization routine to determine @xmath149 , @xmath18 , and @xmath148 , respectively .",
    "we bin the data since we do not have _ a priori _ knowledge , independent of cosmological parameter values , of the inherent scatters associated with the various intrinsic properties of these sources , and by which the @xmath144 values must be weighted ; a binned analysis allows us to obtain unbiased estimates for these scatters in each bin .",
    "note that while the intrinsic sizes @xmath13 appear in relations ( [ prop1 ] ) and ( [ prop3 ] ) , we can only obtain the intrinsic _ projected _ sizes , @xmath135 . using the mean values , @xmath154 , in each bin properly accounts for the presence of projection effects only if the objects in each bin have similar distributions of @xmath14 .",
    "otherwise , the derived values of @xmath149 , @xmath18 , and @xmath147 could reflect variations of @xmath40 and @xmath1 with respect to @xmath14 as well as @xmath13 , and some explicit @xmath14 dependence would need to be added to relations ( [ prop1])-([prop3 ] ) to break this degeneracy . since we can not directly test for @xmath14 correlations parametrically without knowledge of the distributions of @xmath106 and @xmath155 in eq .",
    "( [ reqn ] ) , we explicitly use @xmath152 rather than @xmath156 , with the understanding that these are interchangeable only if the @xmath14 distributions are consistent in each bin .",
    "however , we have already concluded , from the k - s tests of the @xmath50 values in different redshift bins (  2.2 ) , that @xmath14 does not vary significantly with redshift ; we discuss further the @xmath14 distribution below .",
    "the derived values of @xmath18 , @xmath149 , and @xmath148 , as well as the inferred values of @xmath147 , together with the 1@xmath9 errors in each quantity , are listed in the top - left portion of table 2 for a representative 7 of the 199 scenarios .",
    "these results are obtained using all the data above @xmath157 ( i.e. , ranging to the upper envelope defined by some value @xmath141 ) and are thus denoted by an upper limit of @xmath112 in the table .",
    "all 1@xmath9 errors quoted in this section correspond to the square roots of the appropriate diagonal elements of the covariance matrix for that @xmath144 fit ( i.e. , they are the errors obtained with @xmath11 fixed at its trial value and the corresponding constant of proportionality from relations ( [ prop1])-([prop3 ] ) fixed at its best - fit value ) .",
    "for all scenarios , we find a strong ( @xmath15810@xmath9 ) correlation between @xmath153 and @xmath1 , which is expected due to the flux - limited nature of the survey .",
    "we also find an inverse correlation , at the 23@xmath9 level between @xmath152 and @xmath40 , which can be understood in terms of the gradual fading of these sources as the lobes expand over timescales ( @xmath159 yr ) much shorter than @xmath160 , which is indeed the case for quasars in our sample .",
    "previous studies have found @xmath161 for double - lobed quasars assuming an einstein - de sitter universe ( oort 1987 ; kapahi 1989 ; gopal - krishna & kulkarni 1992 ; chyy & ziba 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ; singal 1993 ) , which is consistent with our result for model 1 .",
    "table 2 also shows that the observed data ranging up to @xmath112 exhibit mild apparent size evolution at the @xmath162 2@xmath9 level , with all scenarios yielding @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly , however , the data imply little or no intrinsic size evolution ; all cases yield a slightly negative @xmath152-@xmath1 correlation with @xmath163 , but are consistent with @xmath164 well within the 1@xmath9 level .",
    "the anti - correlation between intrinsic projected size and redshift ( given by @xmath18 ) , seems to arise mainly from the separate correlations of these quantities with intrinsic power .",
    "the lack of intrinsic size evolution in double - lobed quasar samples has been seen by other authors authors as well ( masson 1980 ; singal 1993 ; nilsson 1993 ) .",
    "there is also the possibility that the @xmath154-@xmath40 anti - correlation arises not from intrinsically smaller objects having larger lobe powers , but rather from objects projected close to the line of sight ( cdqs ) having relativistically boosted core power contributing significantly to the total power .",
    "in other words , the correlation could arise from different @xmath14 distributions in different power bins , rather than a true power - size correlation . to explore this possibility ,",
    "we re - solve for @xmath149 , @xmath148 , and @xmath147 using only the lobe power , @xmath165 , which , unlike the total power , is not expected to vary with @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting quantities , denoted by @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 ( @xmath18 remains unchanged ) are listed in the upper - right portion of table 2 .",
    "though differing slightly , the values of @xmath166 are all within 1@xmath9 of the corresponding values for @xmath149 , and still yield an inverse correlation between @xmath152 and @xmath165 , at the 23@xmath9 level in all cases , indicating that , while orientation effects may be present , they are not primarily responsible for producing the observed anti - correlation between intrinsic projected size and power . similarly , the values for @xmath168 differ slightly from those of @xmath147 , in some cases having a different sign , but still agree to well within the 1@xmath9 level , implying that the @xmath154-@xmath1 correlation does not arise primarily from a @xmath14-@xmath1 correlation . as expected , the values of @xmath167 are not significantly different from @xmath148 , since cosmological surface brightness dimming affects @xmath40 and @xmath165 in a similar fashion .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath154-@xmath40 correlation is not the result of orientation effects , but rather due to a negative correlation between @xmath13 and @xmath40 , and furthermore that this correlation , coupled with the @xmath40-@xmath1 relationship appears largely to account for the apparent size evolution in the data",
    ". inspection of various scatter plots of the data for the different scenarios supports these conclusions , suggesting that the negative @xmath152-@xmath40 correlation arises mainly from the fact that the @xmath169 largest projected sources in the sample have low values of @xmath40 and lie preferentially at lower redshifts .",
    "we have already seen , however , that one need not choose the amplitude of @xmath140 to trace the upper envelope to the @xmath0-@xmath1 data ( i.e. , to @xmath112 ) , but can , in principle , choose any value between this and @xmath139 without loss of generality or the introduction of sample bias .",
    "thus , in light of the above conclusions , we re - derive the values of @xmath18 , @xmath149 , @xmath148 , and @xmath147 , fixing the @xmath140 curve in each scenario to have a minimum at @xmath170 ( corresponding to some intrinsic size @xmath171 ) , which eliminates roughly 20 of the largest sources in each scenario .",
    "the removal of these sources reduces the seemingly anomalously high values in the first redshift bins of figures 3a  d , and also eliminates the few exceptionally large sources at @xmath172 ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the results obtained from the remaining samples for the same 7 scenarios are presented in the lower portion of table 2 , where they are denoted by an upper limit of @xmath123 .",
    "we indeed find that , in all trial cases , the magnitude of the @xmath152-@xmath40 correlation diminishes significantly , with @xmath173 in all cases , and is generally consistent with zero at the @xmath174 level . the @xmath153-@xmath1 correlation remains highly significant , as expected .",
    "the derived values for @xmath147 become positive , rather than negative , in all cases , but are generally much smaller in magnitude than those obtained using an upper limit of @xmath112 and are certainly consistent with @xmath175 well within the 1@xmath9 range .",
    "most importantly , we find , as expected for the @xmath123 samples , that there is no significant apparent size evolution , with @xmath18 consistent with zero well within the 1@xmath9 level for all scenarios .",
    "these results confirm that large , fainter sources ( which can be seen only at lower redshifts ) were largely responsible for the power - size correlation and resulting apparent size evolution observed previously , and suggest that we can define a sample whose @xmath0-@xmath1 variation should primarily be due to cosmological effects alone . unlike the case for the samples obtained using an upper limit corresponding to @xmath112 , the values of @xmath166 , @xmath167 , and @xmath168 obtained using @xmath123 , are virtually identical to those for @xmath149 , @xmath148 , and @xmath147 , indicating that for these samples , orientation effects play no role in the @xmath152-@xmath1 and @xmath152-@xmath40 correlations .",
    "the analysis of  3.1 assumes specific functional forms for the relationships between @xmath40 , @xmath13 , and @xmath1 , and is valid only insofar as these parameterizations accurately reflect the underlying physics . if this is not the case , the resulting fitted values are merely artifacts of the model , not parameters truly descriptive of the data .",

    "( [ angular size ] ) and ( [ powerandsize ] ) ) .",
    "thus , a better approach to searching for correlations in the data is to employ non - parametric tests that are independent of an assumed functional form .",
    "in addition , non - parametric statistics offer another advantage in that they are readily applied to unbinned distributions and thus incorporate information that is lost when the distributions are binned .",
    "in particular , the spearman rank correlation coefficient , @xmath177 , tests , in a non - parametric fashion , the degree to which the quantities @xmath178 and @xmath179 are correlated in a given data set , varying from -1 ( for strong negative correlation ) to + 1 ( for strong positive correlation ) , with 0 indicating no correlation .",
    "the spearman partial - rank statistic , @xmath180 , has the same range , and tests whether there is a significant correlation between @xmath178 and @xmath179 which does not arise from both being separately correlated with a third quantity @xmath18 ; i.e. , it effectively tests for a correlation between @xmath178 and @xmath179 if @xmath18 is held constant . for data sets with @xmath181 data points , the distribution of @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is a spearman statistic , is well approximated by a normal distribution with unit variance ( conover 1980 )",
    "thus , for a given data set with an observed spearman statistic @xmath184 , one can easily compute the ( two - sided ) probability @xmath185 , that a random , uncorrelated data set , with @xmath186 , could exhibit this degree of correlation ( positive or negative ) or higher ( i.e. , the probability that @xmath187 ) , and thus obtain the significance of the result .",
    "for the correlation coefficient , @xmath177 , this is simply the probability of seeing @xmath177 occur by chance if there is no intrinsic correlation between @xmath178 and @xmath179 . for",
    "the partial rank statistic , @xmath188 , it is the probability of seeing @xmath188 occur by chance if there is no correlation between @xmath178 and @xmath179 other than that caused by their being separately correlated to @xmath18 .",
    "the upper portion of table 3 shows the results of the rank analysis , listing the spearman statistics for the various combinations of @xmath1 , @xmath138 , and @xmath40 , and the corresponding values of @xmath185 ( given in parentheses ) , for the same 7 of the 199 trial scenarios from  3.1 using an upper limit corresponding to @xmath112 . in all cases investigated , we find evidence for a negative correlation between @xmath138 and @xmath1 at the 90 - 95% confidence level ( given by @xmath189 ) , a significant inverse correlation between @xmath138 and @xmath40 , near the 3@xmath9 level ( i.e. , @xmath190% ) and a highly significant @xmath40-@xmath1 correlation .",
    "moreover , the partial rank correlation coefficient , @xmath191 indicates that the @xmath138-@xmath1 correlation arises entirely from the @xmath138-@xmath40 and @xmath40-@xmath1 correlations , so that @xmath138 and @xmath1 are intrinsically uncorrelated , with @xmath192 in all cases .",
    "intrinsic size evolution is consistent with zero well within 1@xmath9 for all cases and does not account for the mild degree of apparent size evolution .",
    "these results all agree closely with our results from the parametric analysis .",
    "we also tested @xmath138 separately against @xmath165 to see whether the @xmath138-@xmath40 correlation was truly due to a power - size correlation ( to which @xmath165 is sensitive ) , and not due to beaming effects ( to which @xmath165 is not sensitive ) .",
    "we indeed find that values of @xmath193 are close to those for @xmath194 , with the significance level remaining near or above 98% in all cases we do not directly test for a correlation with @xmath195 , since not all sources registered a first core component , but we do eliminate cdqs , using both criteria of @xmath196 and also @xmath197 , re - solve for @xmath198 , and in both cases find similar values to those in table 3 , indicating again that a true power - size correlation , and not beaming effects , are responsible for producing the observed apparent size evolution . also , since some sources listed as having @xmath199 may in truth have some core flux which was not separately represented in the first catalog , we re - perform the analysis including only those sources with @xmath200 and again find virtually identical results to those in table 3",
    ".    in the lower portion of table 3 are the results obtained using an upper limit corresponding to @xmath171 as defined above .",
    "again we confirm the results of the parametric tests , finding that while the @xmath40-@xmath1 correlation remains highly significant , the @xmath138-@xmath40 correlation is reduced in magnitude , with significance typically below the 2@xmath9 level in the various scenarios , and the @xmath138-@xmath1 correlation effectively vanishes in all cases , consistent with zero apparent size evolution . as expected , these results agree with the parametric analysis , but are more robust in the sense that they are independent of the assumed model governing the characteristics of the sources .",
    "the non - parametric analysis also allows us to probe the @xmath14 distributions more directly and examine issues related to unification schemes for radio - loud agns . since @xmath50 is expected to be correlated with @xmath14 via eq .",
    "( [ reqn ] ) , we can , unlike in the parametric case , test for correlations between some quantity @xmath201 and @xmath14 through @xmath202 without invoking assumptions about the distributions of @xmath106 or @xmath155 .",
    "we have already seen that the @xmath14 distribution is not sensitive to redshift and that it does not account for the observed @xmath138-@xmath40 correlation . however ,",
    "if the unified scheme is correct , in the sense that sources projected near the line of sight have relativistically boosted core fluxes , then there should be a negative correlation between @xmath50 and intrinsic projected size , @xmath138 , and , obviously , a positive correlation between @xmath50 and the intrinsic core power , @xmath195 , since @xmath203 .",
    "some sources in the sample may have registered @xmath204 not because they truly lacked a significant core , but rather , in the case of smaller sources , because the first fitting algorithm did not assign that source a core component . assigning the flux in such sources to the lobes had no significant effect on the results above , as seen when we omitted sources lacking a measured core component , but could seriously affect apparent correlations with @xmath50 .",
    "thus we include here only those sources with @xmath205 .",

    "for all cases , we indeed find a significant ( @xmath206% ) inverse correlation between @xmath50 and @xmath138 , as predicted by the unified model .",
    "moreover , while @xmath50 and the total power @xmath40 show no statistically significant relationship , @xmath50 and @xmath195 exhibit a positive correlation with high significance ( @xmath207 ) in all cases , as would be expected . though only suggestive , these results indicate that the behavior of these radio - loud quasars is consistent with the expectations of unification schemes .",
    "having explored the intrinsic properties of the sources over the assumed range of cosmological density parameter values , we now turn to a discussion of the best - fit cosmological results .",

    "we use the resulting @xmath157 and @xmath231 curves to ensure a uniform range of intrinsic sizes , and then determine the best - fit values of @xmath178 and @xmath18 for the remaining data , as well as the value of @xmath144 for this set of parameters . in practice , aligning the minimum intrinsic size cutoff of the various friedmann models with the survey resolution limit , which is vital in terms of producing a self - consistent result , removes 3 to 17 data points depending on the trial value of @xmath11 , but typically fewer than 5 for @xmath232 .",
    "this prescription is meaningless for the euclidean case , which does not exhibit a minimum in the angular size ; for this case we simply follow the approach of past workers and use all the data above the cutoff at @xmath111 .",

    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath185 are computed under the assumption of normally distributed data . though the unbinned intrinsic projected sizes , @xmath134 , and thus the angular sizes , @xmath0 , given by eq .",
    "( [ angular size ] ) , are not expected to follow a normal distribution , or even to be symmetric about their mean values ( see figure 2 ) , the central limit theorem ensures that , for binned data with a sufficiently large number of points , the distribution of the mean value in each bin ( which is , in fact , our dependent variable ) will be close to a gaussian , independent of the underlying distribution .",
    "insofar as we have @xmath239 points in each bin , the probabilities derived from our @xmath144 values might be slightly in error due to any residual non - gaussianity .",
    "moreover , the lower ( and for cases with @xmath171 , upper ) tails of the observed @xmath0 distribution have been removed by the cuts in our analysis method , thereby enhancing the non - gaussianity .",
    "thus , while it is straightforward to compute the mean values and calculate the value of @xmath144 for each trial model , the formal significance of the result can not be obtained in a simple , analytic fashion ( nor can it be computed numerically without knowing the intrinsic size distribution ) ; the listed values of @xmath189 for the various models are intended to be qualitatively illustrative of the relative significance levels , and not rigorously accurate .",
    "since we have no _ a priori _ knowledge of the actual values of the free parameters , all parameter errors quoted here do _ not _ correspond to the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix of the fit ( i.e. , to the error obtained with the other parameters held fixed at their best - fit values ) , but rather to the much larger error range subtended by the joint variation in all free parameters , given conservatively by the various 1-dimensional projections of the 1@xmath9 confidence region in the parameter space .",
    "figure 5 provides a graphical representation of our results .",
    "it is clear that the observed data are entirely consistent with friedmann models with reasonable values of @xmath11 .",
    "the underdense models 2 and 3 both yield @xmath8 with a 1@xmath9 range including values from @xmath240 to 1.00 , and exhibit a fairly flat @xmath144 surface in this range of parameter space , so that they are truly consistent with the value @xmath241 required by model 1 .",

    "all three friedmann models are seen to yield roughly equal values of @xmath189 , indicating , as expected , that the present data can not effectively discriminate between the various friedmann models , although interesting constraints on the free parameters within a given model are obtained .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that model 1 , which is merely a particular case of models 2 and 3 , yields a comparable value of @xmath189 only because @xmath11 is assumed to be known _ a priori _ , thus allowing for an additional degree of freedom in the fit .",
    "any presumed value of @xmath11 within the 1@xmath9 range of the best - fit values would similarly yield a fit on par with that of models 2 and 3 . to the extent that @xmath11 is not pre - determined",
    ", there is no particular significance to the results of model 1 ; it is included primarily because it is the canonical standard among current theoretical models .",
    "note that the best - fit euclidean model ( which uses all the data points ) is the only one which yields a reduced chi - square value , @xmath243 , greater than unity and is actually a comparatively poor fit to the data . for comparison",

    "we have seen that this trend arises primarily from a power - size correlation , rather than from intrinsic size evolution or orientation effects between cdqs and ldqs ( orientation differences between radio galaxies and quasars are ruled out since we have included only the latter in our sample ) .",
    "the values obtained here for @xmath18 agree closely with the corresponding results from section 3 , but differ slightly because we have here assigned each source the value of @xmath16 corresponding to its bin , so that @xmath246 over the @xmath247 bins , rather than taking @xmath248 for each of the @xmath249 sources , and then binning the projected sizes , as in section 3 .",
    "the error ranges also differ since , as described above , we have here taken the errors to arise from the joint variation of all free parameters .",
    "an inspection of the variation of @xmath144 with respect to the free parameters reveals that @xmath144 in a given model is significantly more sensitive to changes in @xmath18 than in @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath250 .",
    "therefore , since the effect of @xmath251 is to decrease the apparent sizes of sources at higher redshifts , mimicing a decrease in @xmath11 , we may infer that , for models 2 and 3 , the best - fit values for @xmath11 obtained using an upper limit corresponding to @xmath112 are likely lower limits to the actual values .",
    "we have already seen , however , that we can define a sample for which apparent size evolution is minimal , and for which the derived values of @xmath11 should therefore correspond more closely to the actual values .",
    "the lower portion of table 5 shows the results obtained using an upper limit corresponding to @xmath252 . in this case",
    ", we see that all models yield @xmath253 , and do indeed find higher best - fit values of 0.84 and 0.93 , respectively , for @xmath11 in models 2 and 3 , appearing to favor a flat universe .",
    "the lower amplitude of the @xmath231 curve , however , removes @xmath169% of the data , and the resulting sample yields larger errors on @xmath11 in models 2 and 3 , effectively spanning the range from 0 to 1 . in this case ,",
    "model 2 yields @xmath254 with 1@xmath9 limits of 0.0 and 0.97 .",
    "we also find that while all three models again fit the data with high significance , that model 1 , with @xmath241 appears to be slightly favored , subject to the qualification discussed above .",
    "since all three models yield similar values for @xmath11 , as well as @xmath178 and @xmath18 , in the @xmath171 case , they each pick out the same 83 data points , and are thus all plotted on the same graph in figure 6 , where they are seen to virtually overlap .    in principle , we could test the robustness of the zero apparent size evolution feature of the @xmath252 data and of our analytic methods , by raising the amplitude of the @xmath157 curve , effectively mimicing a survey with poorer angular resolution . if apparent size evolution was not truly absent , then performing our analysis with a higher survey cutoff would selectively eliminate different fractions of sources in different redshift bins , changing the value of @xmath154 in each bin by different amounts and thus producing a different value for @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the angular size distributions truly are redshift - independent , raising the resolution cutoff in our analysis would remove the same fraction of sources in each bin ( those with sizes below the new value of @xmath117 ) , changing the amplitude of the best - fit curve , but not its shape .",
    "we would thus expect to find a different , higher value for @xmath178 , but the same value for @xmath11 . in practice",
    ", we can not meaningfully conduct this test with the current data set , since it would further remove data from the @xmath252 sample , which already yields formal errors on @xmath11 that span the allowed range , but do employ a similar technique below .",

    "one can further refine the sample by including only radio sources with symmetric and colinear triple structure ( i.e. , core + 2 lobes ) , thereby minimizing asymmetrical effects which might distort the apparent angular size , such as relative motion with respect to the igm , and simplifying the problem of optical identification , since the positions of the central engines are well - determined _ a priori_. we have selected a sample of such objects from the first database ( buchalter 1997 ) and matched these with the automatic plate machine scans of the poss plates ( irwin & mcmahon 1992 ; irwin , maddox , & mcmahon 1994 ) to produce a subset of radio triples having optical counterparts to the central source .",

    "we wish to thank chelsea t. wald for her help in compiling the data sample , as well as alexandre refregier , david schminovich , catherine cress , jacqueline van gorkom , and kevin h. prendergast for their numerous insightful comments and suggestions .",

    "<S> in previous attempts to measure cosmological parameters from the angular size - redshift ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) relation of double - lobed radio sources , the observed data have generally been consistent with a static euclidean universe , rather than with standard friedmann models , and past authors have disagreed significantly as to what effects are responsible for this observation . these results and different interpretations may be due largely to a variety of selection effects and differences in the sample definitions destroying the integrity of the data sets , and inconsistencies in the analysis undermining the results . using the vla first survey , we investigate the @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for a new sample of double - lobed quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we define a set of 103 sources , carefully addressing the various potential problems which , we believe , have compromised past work , including a robust definition of size and the completeness and homogeneity of the sample , and further devise a self - consistent method to assure accurate morphological classification and account for finite resolution effects in the analysis . before focusing on cosmological constraints , we investigate the possible impact of correlations among the intrinsic properties of these sources over the entire assumed range of allowed cosmological parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> for all cases , we find apparent size evolution of the form @xmath2 with @xmath3 which is found to arise mainly from a power - size correlation of the form @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) coupled with a power - redshift correlation . </S>",
    "<S> intrinsic size evolution is consistent with zero . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that in all cases , a subsample with @xmath6 can be defined , whose @xmath0-@xmath1 relation should therefore arise primarily from cosmological effects . </S>",
    "<S> these results are found to be independent of orientation effects , though other evidence indicates that orientation effects are present and consistent with predictions of the unified scheme for radio - loud active galactic nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the above results are all confirmed by non - parametric analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> contrary to past work , we find that the observed @xmath0-@xmath1 relation for our sample is more consistent with standard friedmann models than with a static euclidean universe . though the current data can not distinguish with high significance between various friedmann models , significant constraints on the cosmological parameters within a given model are obtained . in particular , we find that a flat , matter - dominated universe ( @xmath7 ) , a flat universe with a cosmological constant , and an open universe all provide comparably good fits to the data , with the latter two models both yielding @xmath8 with 1@xmath9 ranges including values between @xmath10 and 1.0 ; the @xmath6 subsamples yield values of @xmath11 near unity in these models , though with even greater error ranges . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the values of @xmath12 implied by the data , using plausible assumptions about the intrinsic source sizes , and find these to be consistent with the currently accepted range of values . </S>",
    "<S> we determine the sample size needed to improve significantly the results , and outline future strategies for such work .    </S>",
