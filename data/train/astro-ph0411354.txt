    "( sdss ) have been used to study the recent star formation histories , dust content and metallicities of over @xmath7 nearby galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these analyses make use of specific absorption and emission lines in the galaxy spectra and employ new models of the spectral evolution of galaxies , which include a physically consistent treatment of the production of starlight and its transfer through the interstellar medium ( ism ) in galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , the modeling accounts for the stochastic nature of sf when interpreting galaxy spectra by using large monte carlo libraries of different sf histories to estimate physical parameters such as stellar mass , age , and sf rates in a statistical fashion .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we use a similar approach to interpret the combined ultraviolet ( uv ) and optical colors of 6472 sdss galaxies observed by the _ galaxy evolution explorer ( galex ) _ @xcite .",
    "we show that the addition of uv information to the optical seds of galaxies leads to significant improvements in the estimates of the star formation rates ( sfrs ) , starburst histories and dust attenuations .",
    "we consider galaxies with combined _ galex  _ and sdss photometry , for which spectroscopic redshifts are available from the sdss .",
    "_ galex  _ images the sky at far - uv ( @xmath8 ; 1530  ) and near - uv ( @xmath9 ; 2310  ) bands in two modes : all - sky imaging survey ( ais , @xmath10 ) and medium - deep imaging survey ( mis , @xmath11 ) .",

    "we use @xmath8 and @xmath9 fluxes and errors derived in elliptical apertures . for _ galex  _ sources with counterparts in the sdss dr1 spectroscopic sample we extract sdss @xmath12 model colors normalized to the petrosian @xmath13 magnitude , 90% and 50% petrosian @xmath14-band radii , and the likelihoods of exponential and de  vaucouleurs @xmath13-band light profiles .",

    ". however , brighter red galaxies are still present in our sample .",
    "we use the @xcite population synthesis code to generate libraries of stochastic realizations of model sf histories at five redshifts equally spaced between 0.05 and 0.25 .",
    "each library contains @xmath44 models . for simplicity",
    ", we follow @xcite and parameterize each sf history in terms of two components : an underlying continuous model with an exponentially declining sf law ( sfr@xmath45\\propto\\exp[-\\gamma t]$ ] ) and random bursts superimposed on this continuous model . to be distributed uniformly over the interval from zero to the age of the universe at a given redshift , and the sf timescale parameter over the interval @xmath46gyr@xmath47 .",
    "random bursts occur with equal probability at all times until @xmath48 .",
    "they are parameterized in terms of the ratio between the mass of stars formed in the burst and the total mass of stars formed by the continuous model over the time @xmath15 .",
    "the ratio is taken to be distributed logarithmically from 0.03 to 4.0 . during a burst ,",
    "stars form at a constant rate for a time distributed uniformly in the range 30300  myr .",
    "the burst probability is set so that 50% of the galaxies in the library have experienced a burst in the past 2  gyr . ]",
    "attenuation by dust is described by means of two main parameters ( see @xcite ) : the effective @xmath49-band absorption optical depth @xmath20 affecting stars younger than 10  myr ( that arises from giant molecular clouds and the diffuse ism ) and the fraction @xmath22 of it contributed by the diffuse ism , that also affects older stars . based on previous analyses of sdss galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we take @xmath20 to be distributed from 0 to 6 with a broad peak around 1 and @xmath22 to be distributed from 0.1 to 1 with a broad peak around 0.3 .",
    "our model galaxies have metallicities uniformly distributed between 0.1 and 2 @xmath50 .",
    "we derive statistical estimates of various physical parameters by comparing the observed sed of each galaxy in the sample to the model seds as follows .",
    "first , we convert sdss magnitudes into fluxes , correcting for the offsets between the sdss- and ab - magnitude zeropoints @xcite and applying small zeropoint offsets to _",
    "galex  _ fluxes .",
    "to sdss flux errors we add calibration errors in quadrature . after accounting for galactic reddening , we compare the sed of the observed galaxy to _ all _ seds in the closest - redshift model library .",
    "the @xmath51 goodness of fit of each model determines the _ weight _ ( @xmath52 $ ] ) to be assigned to the physical parameters of that model when building the probability distributions of the parameters of the given galaxy .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of a given physical parameter is thus obtained from the distribution of the weights of _ all _ models in the library .",
    "we characterize the pdf using the median and the 2.397.7 percentile range ( equivalent to @xmath53 range for gaussian distributions ) , and also record the @xmath51 of the best - fitting model .",
    "we perform this analysis for all galaxies in our sample .",
    "the distribution of @xmath51 values of the best - fitting models is generally very good , implying that our libraries do reproduce the observed seds .",
    "however , there is a tail of large @xmath51 values  usually identifiable as objects with suspect sdss magnitudes , or as `` shredded '' objects .",
    "we remove @xmath54 galaxies with poorest fits . in the end , we obtain estimates of physical parameters for 6472 galaxies .",
    "we estimate physical parameters in two ways : using the _ galex  _ @xmath8 and @xmath9 fluxes combined with the sdss @xmath12 fluxes ; and using only the sdss fluxes .",
    "this allows us to quantify the effect of adding ultraviolet constraints .",
    "table  1 summarizes our results . for each physical parameter",
    ", we list the sample - averaged parameter value ( @xmath55 ) derived using _ galex _",
    "+ sdss constraints , `` @xmath56 '' estimate of the average parameter error with ( g+s ) and without ( s ) including the _",
    "galex  _ constraints , and the increase in accuracy ( gain ) achieved with _",
    "galex  _ .",
    "we also investigate the effect of changing the fraction ( from 50% to 10% ) of galaxies in the model libraries that had bursts over the past 2  gyr . in table  1 , we report the resulting rms change in parameter value .",
    "it is usually much smaller than the `` fitting '' error , except for the time @xmath31 since the last burst of sf .",
    "the physical parameters for which the estimates are most significantly improved with _",
    "galex  _ are the 100  myr- and 1  gyr - averaged sf rates , ( sfr(100  myr ) and sfr(1  gyr ) ) , fuv and nuv dust attenuations ( @xmath24 and @xmath26 ) , and estimates of the fraction of a galaxy s stellar mass formed in bursts ( @xmath33(100  myr ) and @xmath57(1  gyr ) ) over the last 0.1 and 1  gyr ( although it is sensitive to the assumed frequency of bursts in the model libraries ) .",
    "in figure [ fig : kauff ] we compare the stellar masses derived from our analysis of _ galex _ + sdss colors with those derived by @xcite .",
    "these authors used the strengths of the @xmath58 absorption - line index and 4000    break in the sdss spectra ( that trace the recent and past - averaged sf histories ) to improve the constraints on the stellar mass - to - light ratios relative to estimates based on a single optical color .",
    "the scatter in the difference between the two types of mass estimates ( 0.11 dex without @xmath59 outliers ) is very well matched by the uncertainties in the two studies ( 0.08 dex ) .",
    "@xcite also compute the fraction of a galaxy s stellar mass formed in bursts over the last 2  gyr . in our study , bursts over 2  gyr are poorly constrained .",
    "this is because the uv light is less sensitive to stars older than 1  gyr than the @xmath60 index .",
    "we have checked that galaxies for which we find @xmath61 have 4000    breaks and @xmath60 strengths typical of galaxies for which @xcite find @xmath33(2  gyr)@xmath62 .",
    "we present our main results in figure [ fig : master ] , where we show the dependence of selected physical parameters on three fundamental galaxy properties : stellar mass , galaxy type , and color .",
    "we use the concentration parameter @xmath63 as a proxy for galaxy type .",
    "values of @xmath63 larger than 2.5 correspond mostly to early - type galaxies , but late - type galaxies can also have large @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "we choose the @xmath2 color as it provides a broad baseline and is not subject to large k - corrections .",
    "objects are color - coded to indicate whether an exponential profile ( blue ) or a de  vaucouleurs @xmath64 profile ( red ) has higher probability .",
    "this serves as an additional rough indicator of galaxy type .",
    "the first row of panels in figure [ fig : master ] presents the derived stellar metallicities .",
    "it was recently demonstrated that star - forming galaxies in sdss exhibit a tight metallicity ( of ism ) vs.  mass correlation @xcite .",
    "although metallicity is not strongly constrained using our method ( see table  1 ) , we do find that low - mass galaxies do not reach metallicities as high as high - mass galaxies .",
    "( note that galaxies with @xmath65 are preferentially disk galaxies , and mostly have @xmath66 . )",
    "massive galaxies span a wide range in @xmath67 , with blue and red dots occupying the same space .",
    "the second row of panels shows that low - mass galaxies on average suffer less attenuation than massive ones , implying that the dust content is smaller , but the range of attenuation in more massive galaxies is larger .",
    "we also find that the dust attenuation in late - type galaxies increases as their @xmath2 colors become redder , but early - type galaxies behave in the opposite fashion .",
    "this probably indicates that the reddest early - type galaxies have little gas , ongoing sf and dust .",
    "next we examine the total current sfr ( averaged over the last 100 myr ) .",
    "we find that _",
    "galex  _ is sensitive to very low sf levels , @xmath68 .",
    "not surprisingly , galaxies with the lowest sfrs are primarily of early type .",
    "however , there is an interesting concentration of red dots at @xmath69 .",
    "this `` population '' has lower concentration index and bluer @xmath2 color than low - sf early - type galaxies .",
    "inspection of the images of a subset of these galaxies with high metallicities reveals that about half of them are spirals ( often disrupted ) , while most others show ( low surface - brightness ) disks .",
    "some 10% appear to be true ellipticals .",
    "this emphasizes the crudeness of classification based on profile fitting .",
    "finally , we note that we compared our sfrs with those derived from aperture - corrected nebular emission @xcite and found excellent overall agreement .",
    "a more detailed comparison of sf metrics will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the last row shows the ratio of current ( last 100  myr ) to past - averaged sf ( the `` @xmath1-parameter '' ) .",
    "galaxies with constant sfr will have @xmath70 , while those undergoing a burst can have @xmath71 .",
    "we find that @xmath1 is close to unity for low - mass galaxies but extends to 0.1 for massive , late - types galaxies , in agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "early - types reach values as low as @xmath72 . the tight correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "color is most remarkable .",
    "it implies that the sf history of a galaxy can be constrained on the basis of the @xmath2 color alone .",
    "we have also examined the relation between sfr and fuv attenuation for the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we find that increasing sfrs are always associated with larger attenuations . at a fixed attenuation",
    ", however , early - type galaxies can have sfrs several orders of magnitude smaller than late - type galaxies .",
    "this suggests a different dependence between dust content and sf in the two types of galaxies .",
    "@xcite also find that the dust attenuation increases with the amount of recent sf as estimated by the dust - corrected nuv flux .",
    "one might worry that because our sample has uv selection , the results shown in figure [ fig : master ] may not apply to the galaxy population as a whole .",
    "we have analyzed the relations between the same galaxy properties as in figure [ fig : master ] for the mis fields , where the uv coverage of galaxies in the sdss spectroscopic sample is substantially more complete .",
    "we found exactly the same _ relations _ between sfr , @xmath1 , @xmath24 and mass , concentration and color .",
    "the most notable difference is that the mis data ( by virtue of going deeper ) contain a larger fraction of massive , concentrated red galaxies .",
    "therefore , while the above results are useful for identifying various trends , they can not be used to study the relative proportions of galaxies with different properties .",
    "finally we perform a time - resolved analysis of starbursts .",
    "we select galaxies that have experienced starburst in which more than 5% of stellar mass ( @xmath73 ) was formed over the last 100  myr and 1  gyr .",
    "figure [ fig : fburst ] gives the fraction of galaxies _ of a given mass _ that have undergone a recent starburst .",
    "the dashed histogram corresponds to bursts within the last 100  myr . for @xmath74 ,",
    "the fraction is @xmath75 , but it declines to zero for the most massive galaxies . over the last 1  gyr ( solid histogram ) some 20% of low - mass galaxies having experienced bursts .",
    "this fraction falls to 5% for larger masses .",
    "qualitatively consistent results are obtained if we restrict the analysis to the mis fields .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , who analyzed starbursts over a 2  gyr timescale .    in this preliminary study of sf history using the uv photometry from _",
    "galex  _ , we demonstrate the promise and point to possible limitations of this dataset when interpreted with galaxy models .",
    "as we gather more data we should be able to better explore the trends suggested here , and to get better statistics on low - mass galaxies .",
