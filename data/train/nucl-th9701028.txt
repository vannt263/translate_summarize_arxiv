    "carbon , which is the fundamental basis of the chemistry of terrestrial life , is produced in red giant stars by burning the helium ash of hydrogen fusion . in order to produce carbon in stellar nucleosynthesis , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 nuclear mass - stability gaps must be bridged .",
    "salpeter and pik pointed out @xcite that the lifetime of @xmath4be is long enough , so that the @xmath5@xmath4be reaction can produce macroscopic amounts of equilibrium @xmath4be in stars .",
    "then , the unstable @xmath4be can capture an additional @xmath6 particle to produce stable @xmath0c .",
    "however , this so - called triple - alpha reaction has very low rate because of the low density of @xmath4be .",
    "hoyle argued @xcite that in order to explain the measured abundance of carbon in the universe , this reaction must proceed through a hypothetical resonance of @xmath0c , thus strongly enhancing the cross section .",
    "hoyle suggested that this resonance is a @xmath7 state at @xmath8 mev ( throughout this paper @xmath9 denotes resonance energy in the center - of - mass frame relative to the three - alpha threshold , while @xmath10 denotes the full width ) .",
    "subsequent experiments indeed found a @xmath11 resonance in @xmath0c in the predicted energy region .",
    "it is the second @xmath11 state ( @xmath1 ) and the second excited state of @xmath0c .",
    "its modern parameters @xmath12 mev and @xmath13 mev @xcite agree well with the old theoretical prediction .",
    "we mention here that the long lifetime of the @xmath4be ground state and the existence of the @xmath1 resonance in @xmath0c at the right energy region are only parts of an incredible chain of fortunate nuclear coincidences , which makes the abundant existence of carbon and oxygen possible . for an interesting account ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to explore the nature of the @xmath1 state in @xmath0c .",
    "the facts that this state is very close to the three - alpha threshold , and that the alpha particle is strongly bound make it probable that the wave function of @xmath1 has a dominant three - alpha clustering nature .",
    "the low - lying states of @xmath0c , including @xmath1 , have been studied in a number of macroscopic ( with structureless alpha particles ) @xcite and microscopic @xcite three - alpha models .",
    "these models reproduce the general features of the low - lying @xmath0c spectrum .",
    "however , all these models without exception assume three - body bound state- or two - body @xmath14 scattering state asymptotics for the wave functions .",
    "thus , none of them obeys the physically correct three - body boundary condition for states above the three - alpha threshold .",
    "those models which use @xmath14 asymptotics with bound - state - like @xmath4be @xcite are seemingly adequate , because the small width of the @xmath4be ground state makes its wave function very similar to a bound state wave function in a large spatial region .",
    "however , one must realize that such a model predicts the states above the three - alpha threshold , e.g.  @xmath1 , to be two - body , @xmath15 , resonances .",
    "this means that currently there is no unambiguous evidence that these resonances are intrinsic states of @xmath0c .",
    "in fact , it was speculated that the @xmath1 state is not a three - body resonance , but an enhancement coming from the @xmath16@xmath17 sequential decay @xcite .",
    "this idea was , however , criticized @xcite by arguing that all the experimental data supported the genuine @xmath0c nature of this state .    in the present paper",
    "we use a method which is able to handle the three - body dynamics of the @xmath1 state correctly .",
    "thus for the first time we can unambiguously show whether this state is a genuine three - alpha resonance in @xmath0c .",
    "we also study other low - lying natural - parity states of @xmath0c .",
    "our model is a microscopic three - cluster @xmath18 resonating group method ( rgm ) approach to the twelve - nucleon system .",
    "the trial function of the twelve - body problem has the form @xmath19l } ( \\bbox{\\rho}_1,\\bbox { \\rho}_2 ) \\bigl\\ } , \\label{wfn}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the intercluster antisymmetrizer , the @xmath21 cluster internal states are translationally invariant @xmath22 harmonic - oscillator shell - model states with zero total spin , the @xmath23 vectors are the intercluster jacobi coordinates , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the angular momenta of the two relative motions , @xmath26 is the total orbital angular momentum and @xmath27 $ ] denotes angular momentum coupling .",
    "the total spin and parity of @xmath0c are @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .    putting ( [ wfn ] ) into the twelve - nucleon schrdinger equation which contains the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath30 ) strong and coulomb interactions , we get an equation for the intercluster relative motion functions @xmath31 .",
    "these functions represent the three - body dynamics of the @xmath0c states . in order to determine these functions",
    ", we have to use a method which can handle three - body resonances .",
    "there are indirect and direct approaches .",
    "the indirect methods , e.g.  @xcite , study the three - body problem at real energies , and extract resonance parameters from the three - body phase shifts . a similar method has recently been used to study the @xmath1 state of @xmath0c @xcite . however , the resonant nature of this state and the resonance parameters were extracted from a bound state wave function by using the wkb approximation .",
    "the aim of the direct methods for resonances is to find the complex - energy poles of the three - body scattering matrix .",
    "for example , in @xcite the authors determined the pole positions of the three - body @xmath32-matrix by analytically continuing the homogeneous faddeev - equation to complex energies . to get a decisive answer to the question of the nature of the @xmath1 state",
    ", we must use a direct method .",
    "our choice is the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "it reduces the problem of asymptotically divergent resonant states to that of bound states , and can handle the coulomb interaction without any problem .",
    "the main point of the csm is , that instead of solving the original schrdinger equation for resonances , a new hamiltonian is defined by @xmath33 and the complex equation @xmath34 is solved . in coordinate space the unbounded similarity transformation @xmath35 acts on a function @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 describes the angular part of @xmath39 . for real angles",
    "@xmath40 , @xmath35 results in a rotation into the complex coordinate plane , whereas for complex @xmath40 , @xmath35 results in a rotation and scaling .",
    "further on , we shall always use real @xmath40 values . in the case of a many - body problem , the transformation given by eq .  ( [ cs ] ) has to be performed in each dynamical jacobi coordinate .    for a broad class of potentials",
    "there is a remarkable connection between the spectra of @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite : ( i ) the bound eigenstates of @xmath41 are eigenstates of @xmath42 , for any value of @xmath40 within @xmath43 ; ( ii ) the continuous spectrum of @xmath41 is rotated by an angle @xmath44 ; ( iii ) the complex generalized eigenvalues of @xmath42 , @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) , belong to its proper spectrum , with square - integrable eigenfunctions , provided @xmath47 . these complex eigenvalues coincide with the @xmath32-matrix pole positions .    in nuclear physics",
    "the csm has been successfully applied to two - body problems , like in a rgm description of @xmath4be @xcite , in an ocm model of @xmath48ne @xcite and in the ocm description of the resonances of @xmath49li @xcite .",
    "it was also tested for three - body resonances @xcite , and was used , e.g. , in a rgm model of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 @xcite , in searching for three - nucleon resonances @xcite , in three - body models of @xmath53he , @xmath49he and @xmath54li @xcite and in an rgm model of @xmath55be and @xmath55b @xcite .",
    "further details and references of the method can be found there .",
    "we note , that the csm is identical to a contour rotation in momentum space @xcite .",
    "the latter method was also used , for example , to study three - body resonances in the @xmath56 nuclei @xcite .",
    "up to eq .",
    "( [ csh ] ) our treatment of three - body resonances is exact .",
    "since the resonant wave functions become square - integrable in the csm , we can use any bound - state method to describe them .",
    "we expand the relative motion functions @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ wfn ] ) in terms of products of tempered gaussian functions , @xmath57y_{l_1m_1}(\\widehat",
    "\\rho_1 ) \\cdot \\rho_2^{l_2 } \\exp [ -(\\rho_2/\\gamma_j)^2]y_{l_2m_2 } ( \\widehat \\rho_2)$ ] ( where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the angular momenta in the two relative motions , respectively , and the widths @xmath58 of the gaussians are the parameters of the expansion ) , and determine the expansion coefficients from the @xmath59 projection equation . this way we discretize the continuum and select the square - integrable solutions of eq .",
    "( [ csh ] ) .",
    "we use ten gaussian basis functions in each relative motion .",
    "the matrix elements of the complex scaled many - body hamiltonians were calculated in exact analytic forms by using computer algebraic techniques .",
    "in order to avoid any possible model dependence of the conclusions we use three different effective @xmath30 interactions . the minnesota ( mn ) force was designed to reproduce low - energy @xmath30 scattering data @xcite , while the rather different volkov 1 ( v1 ) and 2 ( v2 ) forces were obtained from fitting the bulk properties of @xmath60- and @xmath61-shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "each force contains an exchange mixture parameter , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "we fix these parameters by requiring that the energy of the @xmath4be ground state be reproduced .",
    "the harmonic - oscillator size parameters of the alpha particle internal states are chosen to minimize the free - alpha energies .",
    "thus , the wave function of the alpha particle is variationally stabilized .",
    "the size parameters of the alpha particle and the exchange mixture parameters of the @xmath30 forces are listed in table 1 for the three interactions , together with the energies and radii of the alpha particle .",
    "the parameters of the low - lying @xmath4be resonances , given by the mn , v1 and v2 forces , are shown in table 2 .",
    "for @xmath4be we use a two - alpha cluster model wave function , similar to eq .",
    "( [ wfn ] ) @xmath64 the relative motion function @xmath31 is determined by using a two - body scattering approach based on the kohn - hulthn variational method @xcite .",
    "the @xmath65 scattering phase shifts , coming from the mn interaction , are shown in fig .  1 , together with the experimental data . a nice agreement is observed .",
    "the resulting scattering matrices are continued to complex energies , where their poles are localized @xcite .",
    "the resonance parameters in table 2 were extracted from the complex pole positions .",
    "this analytic continuation method is in principle equivalent with the csm , but is numerically far more precise .",
    "the csm has difficulties in localizing very narrow resonances . as an illustrative example",
    ", we performed csm calculations for the @xmath4be resonances and found that although the energy of the ground state is well reproduced , the width is strongly overestimated .",
    "for @xmath40 values which give stable complex energy spectra , with the discretized continuum rotated by close to @xmath44 , this overestimation is more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "we could fine - tune the @xmath40 angle and the gaussian basis parameters to get the experimental widths , but then the discretized continuum points would be scattered , forming a band rather than a line .",
    "if we used such a @xmath40 value in the @xmath0c calculations , the results would be disastrous , making the identification of the resonances impossible .",
    "therefore , we use such @xmath40 values in the @xmath0c calculations which give more or less stable discretized continua .",
    "the price we have to pay for this is that we can not resolve very small widths .",
    "however , this is not a serious problem , because our primary goal is to show the _ existence _ of the @xmath0c states , and not to determine the precise resonance parameters .",
    "our model and effective interactions are probably inadequate for this latter purpose .",
    "the @xmath30 interactions , thus set to reproduce the unbound @xmath4be ground state , are used in the @xmath0c calculations . in this way",
    "we ensure that there is no bound two - body subsystem in the three - alpha system as shown also by the experimental data . therefore , our model handles the three - body dynamics properly , and the resonances we find are genuine three - alpha structures .",
    "we perform calculations for the low - lying natural - parity states of @xmath0c . in the three - alpha wave function ( [ wfn ] )",
    "we include @xmath66 for the @xmath11 and @xmath67 states , and additionally @xmath68 for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 states .",
    "our test calculations show that the addition of further configurations hardly influences the results .",
    "for instance , if we include the @xmath71l=[2,2]0 $ ] configuration in the @xmath72 ground state wave function in addition to the @xmath730 $ ] one , we gain less than 1% in the three - body binding energy and less than 0.1% in the absolute energy of @xmath0c .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the findings of macroscopic models @xcite which assume structureless alpha particles .",
    "we believe that the antisymmetrization causes the @xmath730 $ ] state to strongly dominate .",
    "the parameters of the three - body resonances we find , using the mn , v1 and v2 forces are listed in table 3 , together with the experimental values . the ground state of @xmath0c is strongly overbound by mn , roughly reproduced by v1 and underbound by v2 .",
    "interactions v1 and v2 give almost the same _ absolute _ energy for the ground state , so the difference between the energies relative to the three - alpha threshold comes from the different alpha particle energies shown in table 1",
    ". however , this is not the case for the differences between the mn and v1 and v2 ground state energies .",
    "the reason of the differences between the mn and volkov results is most probably the different exchange mixture structure of these forces . while the mn force reproduces the deuteron binding energy in an @xmath74 space , assumed here , the volkov forces underbind the deuteron",
    "however , the volkov forces unphysically bind the singlet dinucleon states .",
    "we believe that the @xmath0c ground state should be expected to be overbound in three - alpha models .",
    "the reason is that the ground state of @xmath4be is not a perfect two - alpha state .",
    "it has been shown that the inclusion of @xmath75 and @xmath76 channels in the ground state wave function of @xmath4be significantly increases its `` binding energy '' @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to reproduce the @xmath4be ground state energy in a model which contains these configurations , the @xmath30 interaction ( or the @xmath77 interaction in macroscopic models ) should be weakened .",
    "we expect that then the @xmath72 state of @xmath0c would be closer to the experimental position , using the mn force , even if the @xmath0c wave function also contains higher - lying rearrangement channels .",
    "we note , that all macroscopic models underbind the @xmath72 state of @xmath0c @xcite .",
    "the only exception is ref .",
    "@xcite where the `` microscopic '' @xmath77 potential was constructed in a way which took into account some of the effects of the internal structure of the alpha particle . in agreement with our mn result , ref .",
    "@xcite found the ground state of @xmath0c to be overbound .",
    "table 3 shows that all experimentally known low - lying natural - parity states of @xmath0c are reproduced by our model .",
    "this means that these states are all genuine three - alpha resonances . in many cases the calculated resonance parameters are far from the experimental values . in order to get closer to the experiments , major improvements of the model , e.g.",
    ", the inclusion of rearrangement channels with nonzero spin , would be necessary .",
    "our most important result is that we can localize the @xmath1 state as a three - body resonance . in fig .",
    "2 we show the low - energy part of the @xmath11 spectrum of the complex scaled hamiltonian with the mn interaction .",
    "the two three - body resonances are denoted by the circles .",
    "the width of the @xmath1 state is probably overestimated by the csm ( cf .",
    "the discussion about the csm and very small widths ) .",
    "the dots in fig .",
    "2 represent the rotated discretized three - body cut . due to numerical precision problems",
    "these points form a band rather than a line .",
    "we attempted to optimize the gaussian basis , but could not get a result cleaner than the one shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the numerical stability of the continuum points is rather sensitive to the level of precision maintained during the calculations of the complex many - body matrix elements .",
    "although every matrix element was calculated from ( very involved ) algebraic expressions , no special attention was paid to the full optimization of the computational algorithm against the loss of numerical precision .",
    "nevertheless , the identification of the resonances is unambiguous .",
    "we found that the parameters of the resonances are approximately independent of the rotation angle @xmath40 within a reasonable interval .",
    "we performed most of the calculations in table 3 with @xmath78 rad , and checked several of them with @xmath79 rad .",
    "figure 2 shows the result of a calculation with @xmath79 rad .",
    "we have encountered some problems regarding the @xmath70 states . using @xmath78 rad ,",
    "one of these resonances can be lost .",
    "that is why we used @xmath79 rad for this state in table 3 .",
    "in contrast to the ground state of @xmath0c , the @xmath1 state is predicted by all three interactions at roughly the same position , and close to the experiment .",
    "this is not surprising , because the @xmath1 state , being so close to the three - alpha threshold , is expected to be a more perfect three - alpha state than the ground state .",
    "we would like to note , that although the @xmath1 state is a three - body resonance , it does not decay into an uncorrelated three - alpha final state .",
    "experiments show that the decay proceeds predominantly through the @xmath80 sequential process @xcite .",
    "the experimental upper limit for the contribution of the three - alpha decay to the alpha decay width of the @xmath1 state is less then 4% .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath15 decay over the @xmath81 one is the result of the difference between the relative phase spaces @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have studied the resonances of @xmath0c in a microscopic three - alpha model .",
    "we used the complex scaling method , which allowed us to describe the three - body coulomb dynamics correctly for resonances .",
    "we used three different effective nucleon - nucleon interactions and their results are consistent with each other .",
    "we have localized all experimentally known low - lying natural - parity states in @xmath0c , although a better agreement with experiment would require major improvements of our model .",
    "for the first time we were able to unambiguously show that the @xmath1 state of @xmath0c , which plays an important role in the astrophysical triple - alpha process , is a genuine three - alpha resonance .",
