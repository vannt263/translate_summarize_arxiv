    "in the conventional interpretation of the rashba model,@xcite the electron spin interacts with an effective magnetic field due to the electron s relativistic motion in an electric field , resulting in zeeman splitting . the model predicts , among others , spin - degeneracy lifting with a chiral spin structure . this prediction has been experimentally verified in surface states of metals @xcite and topological insulators ( tis ) @xcite as well as interfacial states of hetero structures,@xcite all of which possess inversion symmetry breaking ( isb ) .    in spite of its success in predicting the band splitting and a chiral spin structure , the rashba model has multiple unresolved issues .",
    "first of all , the predicted energy scale of the band splitting is much smaller than the experimentally measured value ( for example , about @xmath3 times smaller for au(111 ) surface bands).@xcite in addition , the effect can only be observed in high atomic number materials.@xcite several arguments have been proposed to resolve these issues . while some groups emphasize the importance of the potential gradient along the surface normal times the charge density as a crucial factor to determine the magnitude of rashba spin splitting,@xcite others argue that splitting energy comes from strong in - plane gradient of the crystal field in the surface layer.@xcite    above - mentioned arguments are , however , somewhat speculative and can not fully explain all aspects of the rashba - related phenomena .",
    "recently , a new interpretation for the rashba effect has been proposed for materials with strong atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc).@xcite the new proposal attributes the rashba - type band splitting to formation of asymmetric charge distribution from local orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and crystal momentum .",
    "the energy splitting comes from the interaction between the electrostatic field due to isb and the asymmetric charge distribution .",
    "the relationship among the directions of asymmetric charge distribution , oam and crystal momentum naturally points to a chiral oam structure , and the chiral spin structure is only concomitant to the chiral oam structure.@xcite    after the new model was proposed , it was also found experimentally and theoretically that chiral oam structure exists in surface states of metals@xcite even when soc is weak .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it was found that the alignment(parallel or anti - parallel ) between spin and oam are band and crystal momentum dependent.@xcite these results are explained within an effective model with a range of atomic soc strength @xmath4 .",
    "= 12.5 cm    the purpose of this work is to expand our earlier work.@xcite we give detailed explanation for the mechanism behind the formation of asymmetric charge distribution , for which our earlier work was also somewhat speculative .",
    "furthermore , we describe in detail characters of spin and oam states for different sizes of atomic soc parameter @xmath4 , in terms of the three major terms ( crystal field , atomic soc , and electrostatic ) in the hamiltonian . with the further understanding , we can describe the band splitting mechanism in more detail for different sizes of soc strength . to confirm our model ,",
    "we extend our effective model to @xmath1-orbital states and study spin and oam structures of au(111 ) surface states as a weak soc case . as for strong soc regime , we take bi@xmath2te@xmath2se and perform circular dichroism angle resolved photoemission ( cd - arpes ) experiments as well as first - principles calculations on the system .",
    "bi@xmath2te@xmath2se single crystals were grown using the self - flux method .",
    "the stoichiometry and high crystallinity of the single crystals were confirmed by energy dispersive spectroscopy and x - ray diffraction measurements , respectively .",
    "arpes measurements were performed at the beamline 7u of uvsor equipped with mb scientific a-1 analyzer.@xcite samples were cleaved @xmath5 @xmath6 to obtain clean surfaces .",
    "data were taken with right and left circularly polarized ( rcp and lcp , respectively ) @xmath7 ev light .",
    "circular polarization was achieved by using a mgf@xmath2 @xmath8 wave plate .",
    "the total energy resolution was set to be @xmath7 mev at @xmath7 ev , and the angular resolution was @xmath9 which corresponds a momentum resolution of @xmath10 .",
    "experiments were performed at @xmath7 k under a base pressure better than @xmath11 torr .    in order to examine the spin and oam structures of bi@xmath2te@xmath2se in more detail , we performed first - principles density - functional theory calculations using openmx code@xcite within the generalized gradient approximation of perdew , burke and ernzerhof.@xcite the self - consistent norm conserving pseudopotentials of bi , te and se were generated from the openmx database .",
    "supercells of the slab model of bi@xmath2te@xmath2se with a thickness ranging from 1 quintuple layer ( ql ) to 4 qls were used to investigate surface states .",
    "parameters of the supercell geometry are based on the experimental data .",
    "= 12.5 cm    the effective hamiltonian includes three major terms as described earlier@xcite : crystal field , atomic soc and electrostatic terms .",
    "the electrostatic term , which stems from the interaction between asymmetric charge distribution and electrostatic field , is the most unfamiliar one .",
    "this term is derived from the hamiltonian with soc .",
    "it is given by @xmath12 in the presence of an isb on surface or interface , we need to consider an extra electric field in addition to the atomic field .",
    "we assume that this external field has only @xmath13-component and thus replace @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 is approximately @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is constant ) .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath19 the first two terms , kinetic and potential energies in the bulk , give the usual band energy .",
    "the fourth term describes the atomic soc , @xmath20 , and the last term is the well - known rashba hamiltonian , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 . as mentioned above",
    ", the effect of rashba hamiltonian is negligible .    on the other hand ,",
    "the third term is what gives the interaction between the asymmetric charge distribution and surface electrostatic field .",
    "an earlier report@xcite provides detailed calculation for interaction between the asymmetric charge distribution and surface electrostatic field by tight - binding and first - principles calculations . according to it",
    ", the electrostatic hamiltonian should be approximately given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a proportionality constant that increases as the overlap of atomic orbitals for a small @xmath25.@xcite note that this term comes from a non - relativistic term in equation ( 2 ) and that the only relativistic contribution is in the atomic soc itself .",
    "we will now show pictorially how the third term in equation ( 2 ) contributes to the formation of asymmetric charge distribution in the presence of local oam and crystal momentum .",
    "let us consider a bloch state as an array of atomic orbitals with a local ( atomic ) oam , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the bloch state is depicted in fig .",
    "1 with the oam in the @xmath13-direction ( out of the page ) .",
    "the eigenvalue of @xmath28 operator is @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "1(a ) depicts a state with zero crystal momentum .",
    "we investigate phases of three neighboring atomic orbitals .",
    "when @xmath31 is the angle between the @xmath32-axis and point a , the phase @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 .",
    "the phases of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37-th orbitals at point @xmath38 are @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , respectively . meanwhile , the phases are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 at point @xmath45 .",
    "one can see that there is no difference in the electron density at the points @xmath38 and @xmath45 because squares of the exponentials of phase differences are the same for the two points ,    @xmath46 is proportional to distance .",
    "the situation is different for non - zero crystal momentum shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) . in this case ,",
    "an additional phase @xmath47 arising from the bloch momentum is added for the next atomic orbital as shown in the figure . unlike the zero momentum case in fig .",
    "1(a ) , squares of the the exponentials of phase differences are different for @xmath48 and @xmath49 . consequently , the electron density becomes asymmetric ( less phase difference and thus higher electron density for point @xmath49 ) .",
    "one important aspect of our argument relating density asymmetry",
    "to oam is that it comes from a non - relativistic term in the hamiltonian and thus should occur even when the soc is weak.@xcite    from our argument it is clear that the charge imbalance is a consequence of the phase differences induced by the oam . without oam ,",
    "the phases at symmetric points such as a and b will always be such that the same squared modulus ( i.e. the density ) will result .",
    "it may be deduced that the asymmetric charge distribution should be ( at least approximately ) proportional to @xmath50 itself . with the direction of the oam ( taken to be along the @xmath13-direction ) and the crystal momentum ( taken to be along the @xmath51-direction )",
    ", we find that the induced dipole moment is along the @xmath32-direction . with the proportionality of",
    "the induced dipole moment to both the non - zero oam and finite @xmath25 , we conclude that the dipole moment must have the functional form @xmath52.@xcite then the hamiltonian is given approximately by    @xmath53    it is similar to the well - known rashba hamiltonian with the spin operator replaced by the oam operator but can account for the energy splitting scale ( @xmath54).@xcite    our argument and the conclusion regarding the form of the electrostatic energy derived in equation ( 5 ) remains valid when the crystal momentum is sufficiently close to any time reversal invariant momentum ( trim ) points . since @xmath47 ought to be @xmath55 ( @xmath36 is an integer ) at trim points , interference effects vanish leading to equal charge densities at point @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "small deviation of the crystal momentum @xmath25 from the trim vector @xmath56 then results in the same interference - induced density imbalance already discussed for @xmath25 near 0 .",
    "therefore , we may replace the crystal momentum @xmath25 by @xmath57 .",
    "the actual electronic structure is determined by the competition among the new electrostatic hamiltonian @xmath58 , atomic soc @xmath59 ( fourth term in equation ( 2 ) ) and the crystal field @xmath60 energies.@xcite if either @xmath61 or @xmath59 is significant ( relative to @xmath60 ) , the system tries to lower the energy by having non - zero oam .",
    "in fact , previous experimental and theoretical studies have shown existence of oam in both strong and weak soc regimes.@xcite in the strong soc regime , the system prefers to have non - zero oam due to @xmath59 , while it is @xmath61 that induces non - zero oam in the weak soc regime . in our previous work,@xcite au(111 ) surface states were presented as an example of a weak soc system .",
    "it is a weak soc system because , while inner and outer band spins are anti - parallel to each other , oam directions are parallel ( that is , spin and oam do not form @xmath0-states ) .",
    "even though energy states were obtained for weak soc regime by using an effective hamiltonian , the mechanism behind the energy splitting was not thoroughly described.@xcite therefore , we try to describe below how the characters of states evolve as the atomic soc strength @xmath4 varies .",
    "figure 2 shows schematic of energy levels and angular momentum configurations of @xmath62-states as a function of atomic soc strength @xmath4 . in the case of no soc and no isb shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , there are spin - degenerate states with no oam .",
    "the energy splitting is solely determined by the crystal field energy @xmath63 .",
    "when an additional electric field @xmath64 appears due to an isb , oam is formed and the states eventually evolve into oam based @xmath65 states with the energy scale determined by @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "2(c ) ) . when a small soc is present , the spin - degeneracy is lifted and states split further into spin non - degenerate states ( fig .",
    "2(d ) ) , with the energy splitting scale determined by @xmath20 . note that spin and oam align differently for the two spin splitting bottom bands .",
    "as for the strong soc case illustrated in fig .",
    "2(e ) , total angular momentum @xmath0-states become a better representation . spin and",
    "oam remain anti - parallel ( @xmath67 states ) or parallel ( @xmath68 states).@xcite the larger energy scale is the energy difference between @xmath67 and @xmath69 states , and is determined by @xmath59 .",
    "meanwhile , the smaller energy scale of the split bands ( @xmath70 states ) is determined by @xmath61 .",
    "the validity of the above description can be checked with the expectation value of each contribution to the total energy splitting in the dashed box in fig .",
    "2 . plotted in fig .",
    "3 are the total @xmath71 , atomic soc @xmath59 and electrostatic @xmath61 energies as a function of atomic soc strength and crystal momentum.@xcite the total energy in fig .",
    "3(a ) shows that for a given @xmath4 , the energy splitting is approximately proportional to the crystal momentum @xmath25 as expected .",
    "looking at the contribution from @xmath59 in fig .",
    "3(b ) , for a fixed @xmath25 , we find it initially increases but then decreases to an insignificant number as @xmath4 increases .",
    "this means that @xmath59 determines the energy splitting for a small soc case but it is insignificant for a large soc case .",
    "the contribution from @xmath61 plotted in fig .",
    "3(c ) shows that it is @xmath61 that determines the energy splitting in the large soc regime .",
    "these results are very much consistent with the above description . in spite of the change in the role ,",
    "the energy splitting remains to be linear in crystal momentum @xmath25 . in the weak soc regime , the oam size increases linearly with @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , the energy splitting @xmath72 is also linearly dependent on @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "oam is fully polarized in the strong soc regime and the energy splitting @xmath23 is again linearly dependent on @xmath25 .",
    "this makes the energy splitting always linearly proportional to @xmath25 , independent of the size of @xmath4 .",
    "we now wish to apply the effective hamiltonian to real systems with weak and strong soc strength @xmath4 .",
    "even though we have discussed evolution of electronic structure as a function of @xmath4 in our previous work,@xcite the effective hamiltonian was not applied to real systems .",
    "in fact , while @xmath1-orbitals were found to play the major role in the band splitting in au(111 ) states ( a weak soc system),@xcite only @xmath62-orbitals were considered in the effective hamiltonian for simplicity.@xcite here we expand our previous work and construct an effective hamiltonian for @xmath1-states in the form of @xmath73 matrix , similar to the @xmath62-orbital case of @xmath74 matrix.@xcite we take sample normal direction as y - axis and consider 4 terms in the hamiltonian : kinetic energy @xmath75 , crystal field @xmath60 , atomic soc @xmath59 , and the electrostatic energy @xmath61 . for @xmath75 ,",
    "we simply add a @xmath76 term to account for the parabolic bands of au(111 ) surface states .",
    "@xmath60 is energy splitting between in - plane and out - of - plane orbitals . for @xmath1-orbitals ,",
    "there are five states that have spin - degeneracy . among them , @xmath77 and @xmath78 orbitals have the lowest energy of 0 .",
    "@xmath79 and @xmath80 have @xmath81 , and @xmath82 has @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) . while @xmath59 is simply @xmath85 , @xmath61 comes from interaction of the surface electric field and asymmetric charge distribution .",
    "the total hamiltonian is estimated in the basis of @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "we assume the momentum is along the @xmath51-axis without loss of generality .",
    "the result is given by    @xmath96    where @xmath97 .",
    "band , spin and oam structures can be obtained by diagonalizing the matrix .",
    "we adjusted c , @xmath81 , @xmath83 and @xmath24 until calculated bands match experimentally measured dispersions .",
    "4(a ) plots the resulting band structure along with the direction of spin ( red symbol ) and oam ( blue symbol ) .",
    "more details on the spin and oam structures are shown in fig .",
    "4(c ) and 4(d ) .",
    "the oam in the inner and outer bands are parallel to each other while spins are in opposite directions .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the inner band oam ( represented by the lengths of the arrows in the figure ) is larger than that of the outer band .",
    "these results are consistent with previous cd arpes and band calculation results.@xcite we also find that the magnitude of oam increases linearly with the crystal momentum .",
    "we find that the spin and oam alignment is opposite for inner and outer bands ( that is , parallel for inner and anti - parallel for outer ) .",
    "this fact puts au(111 ) states in the weak soc regime . as for the energetics , we see that the outer band which has anti - parallel spin and oam alignment has a lower energy than the inner band with parallel spin and oam .",
    "it suggests that the energy difference between the two bands comes from @xmath59 , @xmath98 , the energy difference comes from the difference in the alignment between spin and oam .    to confirm this fact , we calculate expectation values of @xmath71 , @xmath59 and @xmath61 as a function of the crystal momentum and plot them in fig . 4(b ) .",
    "first of all , all the energies increase approximately linearly with the momentum . in addition",
    ", major portion of the total energy comes from @xmath59 , confirming that @xmath59 indeed determines the energy splitting in the weak soc regime .      finally , we move to the strong soc regime .",
    "tis are generally materials with very strong soc and therefore belong to the strong soc regime . among various tis , we choose bi@xmath2te@xmath2se for the discussion .",
    "since the relevant orbitals are bi @xmath62-orbitals , we use the previously obtained effective hamiltonian of @xmath62-orbitals.@xcite as discussed in our previous study , spin and oam are always anti - parallel to each other ( for @xmath67 ) due to the strong atomic soc and the magnitude of oam is somewhat independent of the electron momentum @xmath25.@xcite    to confirm the result of our model in strong soc region , we performed cd arpes experiments and dft calculations on bi@xmath2te@xmath2se and investigated oam and spin configurations .",
    "5(a ) , 5(b ) and 5(c ) show cd - arpes along the @xmath99-@xmath100 direction .",
    "the binding energy of the dirac point at the @xmath99 point is e(@xmath99 ) = 407 mev while the fermi momentum @xmath101 = 0.097@xmath102 .",
    "these values are consistent with the published data.@xcite rcp and lcp data in fig .",
    "5(a ) and 5(b ) show similar features except some difference in the intensity profile .",
    "5(c ) plots the cd arpes data cd = rcp @xmath103 lcp .",
    "the cd arpes data changes from red(@xmath103 ) to blue(@xmath104 ) as @xmath105 increases .",
    "note that the color within one side of the band does not change much , indicating the magnitude of oam remains approximately constant .",
    "we also plot the fermi surface data in fig .",
    "the cd pattern is roughly consistent with the chiral oam structure in bi@xmath2se@xmath106.@xcite upon a closer inspection , one can see there is non - sinusoidal variation which is similar to the bi@xmath2te@xmath106 case .",
    "we therefore attribute the detailed variation to the hexagonal warping term.@xcite to check the size of oam as a function of the crystal momentum , we plot the cd data between the dirac point and fermi energy in fig .",
    "uniform chiral oam structure near the @xmath99-point confirms that oam is fully polarized and its magnitude is independent of the crystal momentum .",
    "as bi@xmath2te@xmath2se belongs to the strong soc regime , the dominant mechanism behind the rashba - type band splitting comes from the electrostatic term @xmath23 .",
    "we also performed dft calculation to study the spin and oam structures .",
    "6 shows the results of dft band calculation on bi@xmath2te@xmath2se .",
    "we find that there is a large gap for less than 3 quintuple layers ( qls ) at the @xmath99-point .",
    "the gap reduces to 7.4 mev for 4qls and surface states are well separated .",
    "we plot the band structure of 4qls in fig .",
    "this result is consistent with the arpes data in fig .",
    "5 as well as previous calculation results.@xcite    plotted in fig . 6(b ) and 6(c ) are in - plane components of spin and oam of surface states at @xmath107 .",
    "note that surface states at @xmath107 are from the upper dirac cone which corresponds to the ` inner band ' of the rashba - type splitting .",
    "the overall spin and oam textures are similar to those for bi@xmath2se@xmath106.@xcite an important aspect of the structure is that spin and oam are anti - parallel , unlike the au(111 ) case , despite that they are in the inner band .",
    "this shows that spin and oam remain anti - parallel in all bands in the strong soc regime . as for the magnitude of oam , there is a small decrease in the in - plane component across some @xmath108-point due to formation of the out - of - plane component @xmath109 due to the warping effect as found in bi@xmath2se@xmath106 case.@xcite overall , oam remains almost fully polarized .",
    "these observations put bi@xmath2te@xmath2se in the strong soc regime and show that the band splitting energy comes mostly from the electrostatic term @xmath23 .",
    "the mechanism for rashba - type band splitting is thoroughly examined .",
    "we first describe in detail the formation of asymmetric charge distribution that appear when oam and crystal momentum of a tight binding state are interlocked . to better understand the mechanism , we vary the atomic soc strength from a small value to a large value , and investigate various aspects of the states . in the weak soc regime , orbital angular momentum @xmath110-states are a proper description of the eigenstates and the spin energy is dominantly described by the atomic soc term . on the other hand , in the case of strong soc ,",
    "eigenstates are close to @xmath0-states and the energy is mostly determined by the electrostatic term .",
    "we extend our effective hamiltonian to @xmath1-states and apply it to the au(111 ) case . finally , we performed cd arpes experiment and dft calculation on bi@xmath2te@xmath2se to study spin and oam structures .",
    "we find our effective hamiltonian can consistently describe spin and oam structures of the weak ( au(111 ) surface states ) and strong ( bi@xmath2te@xmath2se ) soc cases .",

    "<S> microscopic mechanism for the rashba - type band splitting is examined in detail . </S>",
    "<S> we show how asymmetric charge distribution is formed when local orbital angular momentum ( oam ) and crystal momentum get interlocked due to surface effects . </S>",
    "<S> an electrostatic energy term in the hamiltonian appears when such oam and crystal momentum dependent asymmetric charge distribution is placed in an electric field produced from an inversion symmetry breaking ( isb ) . </S>",
    "<S> analysis by using an effective hamiltonian shows that , as the atomic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) strength increases from weak to strong , originally oam - quenched states evolve into well - defined chiral oam states and then to total angular momentum @xmath0-states . in addition , the energy scale of the band splitting changes from atomic soc energy to electrostatic energy . to confirm the validity of the model , we study oam and spin structures of au(111 ) system by using an effective hamiltonian for the @xmath1-orbitals case . as for strong soc regime , we choose bi@xmath2te@xmath2se as a prototype system . </S>",
    "<S> we performed circular dichroism angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments as well as first - principles calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effective model can explain various aspects of spin and oam structures of the system . </S>"
