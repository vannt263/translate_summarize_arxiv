    "ferromagnetic semiconductors unite the long - range magnetic ordering characteristic of ferromagnets with the versatile properties of conventional semiconductors .",

    "moreover , novel spin - electronic devices can be realized using ferromagnetic semiconductors , in which the electronic functionality is directly linked to magnetic properties such as the magnetization orientation @xcite . for device applications it is attractive to control the magnetic properties via a _ non - magnetic _ parameter . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the approach to strain a dilute magnetic semiconductor ( dms ) lattice by means of an external piezoelectric actuator in order to manipulate its magnetic properties . using gamnas as the dms , we discuss in detail the piezo - voltage control of the magnetic anisotropy , which can be utilized to reversibly manipulate magnetization orientation as well as to irreversibly switch the magnetization between two magnetic easy axis orientations .",
    "the experiments discussed here pave the way for the three dimensional control of spins via a non - magnetic control parameter .",
    "we begin with a short introduction into gamnas , before reviewing different approaches to influence the magnetic properties of magnetic semiconductors via non - magnetic parameters reported in literature .",
    "ga@xmath8mn@xmath9as is the prototype ferromagnetic semiconductor .",
    "although its curie temperature @xmath10  k is still below room temperature , it has been investigated vigorously in the last decade @xcite .",
    "the effect of the mn incorporation is twofold : on the one hand , the half - filled @xmath11-shells of the mn@xmath12 ions provide localized magnetic moments with spin @xmath13 . on the other hand",
    ", mn also is a shallow acceptor in gaas , so that ferromagnetic gamnas doped with a few percent of mn is degenerately p - type .",
    "these itinerant holes mediate the ferromagnetic exchange between the localized mn moments @xcite , linking the magnetic properties of gamnas to the gaas valence band structure @xcite .",
    "the strong @xmath14-@xmath11 coupling between the delocalized holes and the localized electrons in the mn @xmath11-shell results in large magnetoresistive effects in gamnas .",
    "for example , the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) has a `` giant '' transverse ( planar hall ) component @xcite .",
    "the anomalous hall effect due to the magnetization in gamnas is routinely exploited for magnetic characterization purposes @xcite . moreover , the spin polarization of the itinerant holes is large , with values of up to @xmath15 reported in literature @xcite . since the magnetic domains extend over 100 microns or more @xcite , gamnas is ideally suited as a spin - injecting or spin - polarizing contact in spintronic devices . indeed , novel functionalities or physical effects have already been demonstrated in spin - electronic devices based on gamnas , such as the emission of circularly polarized light from a so - called spin light emitting diode @xcite , the controlled motion of domain walls via current pulses @xcite , the tunneling anisotropic magnetoresistance in gamnas / insulator / normal metal structures @xcite , and non - volatile memory device concepts @xcite .",
    "ga@xmath8mn@xmath9as layers grown on gaas are compressively strained , leading to a first - order uniaxial magnetic anisotropy so that the film plane is an easy magnetic plane for the typical range of mn concentrations ( @xmath16 ) @xcite .",
    "a smaller cubic ( biaxial ) anisotropy yields two approximately orthogonal easy axes within the film plane .",
    "furthermore , a small in - plane uniaxial anisotropy along @xmath17 $ ] is present in most gamnas films on gaas @xcite , the microscopic origin of which is still controversially discussed . in gamnas films with tensile strain , in contrast",
    ", the film plane is magnetically hard @xcite , so that the magnetization aligns along the film normal at low magnetic fields .",
    "furthermore , the magnetic anisotropy in gamnas qualitatively changes with the temperature . in comparison to other ferromagnetic metals ,",
    "demagnetization effects only play a minor role in gamnas , as the saturation magnetization is small due to the small concentration of magnetic ions .",
    "one of the most intriguing properties of dms is the strong dependence of their magnetic properties on non - magnetic parameters , such as electric field @xcite , light irradiation @xcite , temperature @xcite , dopant density @xcite , strain @xcite , or pressure @xcite .",
    "this allows for various control schemes of the magnetic properties of dms , which we shortly discuss in the following .",
    "ohno _ et al . _ @xcite demonstrated that an electric field - control of ferromagnetism is possible in inmnas samples covered with a metallic gate . upon the application of an appropriate voltage to the gate electrode ,",
    "the density of itinerant holes is altered , which allows to switch on or off the ferromagnetic exchange .",
    "electrically assisted magnetization reversal , as well as electrical demagnetization have already been demonstrated in devices utilizing this effect @xcite .",
    "while this electric field - control of ferromagnetism appears very attractive for spintronic devices , the high carrier density in degeneratly doped dms and the resulting screening effects limit the thickness of magnetic semiconductor films controllable by electric fields to a few nm at most , imposing severe constraints on the device geometries .    another approach to vary the hole concentration and thus the magnetic properties relies on the introduction of additional non - magnetic dopant species into gamnas .",
    "by co - doping gamnas with be , the relative strength of the cubic and uniaxial magnetic anisotropy contributions can be altered @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of up to @xmath18 of al into gamnas significantly reduces the density of free holes , eventually leading to a magnetically hard film plane @xcite .",
    "the incorporation of hydrogen also allows to control the hole density in gamnas @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen atom forms a complex with the mn ion @xcite and thereby passivates its acceptor function , while the localized 3__d _ _ electrons stay unaffected .",
    "the hydrogen incorporation is stable at ambient temperatures , but can be reversed by a mild thermal as well as a pulsed - laser annealing @xcite .",
    "however , while the exchange coupling in gamnas films with thicknesses of several hundred nm can be switched on or off via co - doping or hydrogenation , these techniques do not allow to manipulate the magnetization orientation while operating a spintronic device .",
    "for the realization of dms tunable during device operation , the dependence of the magnetic properties on the crystal lattice appears much more promising .",
    "_ showed that the ferromagnetic exchange interaction in inmnsb can be controlled via the application of hydrostatic pressure @xcite .",
    "as discussed above , the magnetic anisotropy in gamnas was found to qualitatively change as a function of strain @xcite .",
    "recently also the control of the mangnetic anisotropy via anisotropic strain relaxation in patterened structures has been reported @xcite .",
    "these experimental observations are explained by the established theoretical model for the ferromagnetic exchange @xcite : the strain alters the symmetry of the hole wave function in the gaas valence band , which due to the hole - mediation of ferromagnetic exchange has a strong influence on the magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this picture also is compatible with the recent measurements of the magneto - elastic constants of gamnas in micro - mechanical devices @xcite .    in the following",
    "we will investigate the control of the magnetic anisotropy of gamnas via the application of an external stress by a piezoelectric actuator .",
    "this approach has already been shown to allow in - situ manipulation of magnetic anisotropy in piezoelectric actuator / ferromagnet hybrid samples at room temperature @xcite .",
    "we have recently demonstrated that this approach can be transfered to piezoelectric actuator / gamnas hybrids @xcite , as also reported by @xcite .",
    "here we compile our extensive experimental findings and show that they can be understood consistently using a free energy model . in particular , we make use of the strong temperature dependence of the magnetic anisotropy in gamnas to tune the free energy surface so that the effect of strain on the magnetic properties is maximal .",
