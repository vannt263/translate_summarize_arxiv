    "experiments with optically controlled cold atoms are able to turn new concepts and theoretical models into reality.@xcite for example , the bose - hubbard hamiltonian@xcite was realized and the superfluid - insulator transition was observed,@xcite a fermionic mott insulator was created,@xcite anderson localization was detected,@xcite the spin hall effect was measured,@xcite and exotic features such as fractional statistics were perceived.@xcite in particular , such experiments make it possible to simulate models and discover phenomena which are absent in solid state physics .",
    "one such model , namely fermions on a lattice with spin - dependent hopping , was already realized.@xcite in another experiment a spin - dependent periodic potential was formed.@xcite a possible next step is to implement a lattice system with spin - dependent disorder by combining spin - dependent and local random potentials.@xcite    spin - dependent disorder may , in principle , be realized experimentally by focusing light beams with different polarization on an optical lattice , after having been scattered from a diffusive plate.@xcite this leads to a spin - dependent , speckle - type effective random potential which is characterized by a short correlation length and pronounced statistical independence@xcite and which acts differently on particles with different spin orientation in the ground state .",
    "thereby spin - dependent speckle - type disorder modifies the local one - particle energies , hopping amplitudes , and interparticle interaction potentials .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the anderson and mott metal - insulator transitions ( mit ) within the fermionic hubbard model in the presence of spin - dependent disorder .",
    "surprisingly , up to now the influence of such a type of disorder on correlated lattice fermions has not yet been investigated in detail .",
    "scalettar and collaborators@xcite analyzed the pairing instability in the attractive case , while the present authors studied the thermodynamical properties in the repulsive case.@xcite by employing the dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) with arithmetic average over the disorder it was shown@xcite that spin - dependent disorder with a symmetric probability distribution function ( pdf ) , @xmath0 , yields a finite magnetization in the repulsive hubbard systems on a bipartite lattice away from half - filling . at half - filling this novel type of disorder",
    "breaks the particle - hole and spin symmetries , but no magnetization appears .",
    "the absence of magnetization is explained by the fact that the symmetry of the spin resolved local density of states ( ldos ) @xmath1 is preserved in the interacting system , so that the number of states below the fermi energy @xmath2 is unchanged .",
    "there remains the questions how spin - dependent disorder will affect the mott - hubbard transition and anderson localization , respectively .",
    "in particular , in the case of non - interacting fermions , particles with different spin are independent and anderson localization can therefore occur only in that spin subsystem on which the disorder acts . in the following",
    "we will shown that when the interaction is turned on , metallic and anderson insulating states for different spin subsystems coexist in a large part of the phase diagram .",
    "for this purpose we employ the dmft together with the _ geometric _ average over the disorder , since the latter is sensitive to anderson localization even within a one - particle description.@xcite employing the geometric rather than the arithmetic average corresponds to determining the typical ldos@xcite within the dmft .",
    "this approach was recently used to calculate the paramagnetic@xcite and antiferromagnetic@xcite phase diagrams of the disordered hubbard model as well as the phase diagram of the disordered falicov - kimball model.@xcite thereby it was possible to determine the mit due to disorder ( anderson localization ) and interactions ( mott - hubbard transition ) , respectively , as well as the rich transition scenario caused by the simultaneous presence of interactions and disorder , within a unified framework . a recent experiment on correlated",
    ", disordered fermionic cold atoms@xcite confirmed that the anderson localization line indeed increases linearly with the interaction strength as predicted in ref .  .",
    "in the following we will refer to disorder acting equally on both spin subsystems as  conventional disorder  to distinguish it from the spin - dependent disorder discussed here , where different random one - particle potentials act on the individual spin subsystems . in this study",
    "we do not consider long - range antiferromagnetic order since current experiments are still at temperatures above the neel temperature.@xcite",
    "the system under consideration is modeled by the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian at half filling with spin - dependent diagonal disorder @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the annihilation ( creation ) operator of a fermion at site @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the @xmath8 component of the spin , @xmath9 is the particle number operator , @xmath10 is the hopping amplitude between site @xmath6 and @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the on - site repulsion .",
    "the local spin - dependent potentials @xmath13 represent uncorrelated random variables drawn from a pdf @xmath14 . in this study the spin - dependent disorder is modeled by a rectangular ( box ) pdf given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the heaviside step function and @xmath17 is the strength of the disorder .",
    "it means that particles with spin @xmath18 move on a lattice with a random potential whereas particle with spin @xmath19 propagate on a uniform lattice . in the absence of disorder",
    "the system has su(2 ) spin symmetry and , at half - filling , is also particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the spin - dependent disorder breaks both symmetries since the on - site energy @xmath13 is equivalently represented by a random local chemical potential @xmath20 and a random local zeeman magnetic field @xmath21.@xcite    the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian ( [ ah ] ) is solved within the dmft.@xcite here we map the hamiltonian ( [ ah ] ) onto an ensemble of single - impurity anderson models @xmath22 with random spin - dependent atomic energies @xmath23 drawn from the same pdf @xmath24 as in ( [ ah ] ) .",

    "these equations must be solved iteratively to reach self - consistency . for comparison",
    "we also calculate the arithmetically averaged ldos @xmath41 .",
    "we choose a model dos , @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the bandwidth , and @xmath44 sets the energy unit . for this dos the local green function and the hybridization function",
    "are simply related by @xmath45.@xcite here , the system is assumed to be paramagnetic down to the zero temperature . the phase diagram and dynamical quantities for the model ( [ ah ] ) are computed by solving the dmft equations at zero temperature with the numerical renormalization group method ( nrg)@xcite in each iteration step . for this purpose",
    "we implemented the open source nrg ljubljana code.@xcite",
    "the main result of our investigation is the ground state phase diagram of the anderson - hubbard model with spin - dependent disorder shown in fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] .",
    "it differs significantly from the corresponding phase diagram for conventional disorder.@xcite three different phase transitions take place : ( i ) a mott - hubbard type mit for weak disorder @xmath17 , where the correlation gap at the fermi level opens in the ldos for spin up and down , ( ii ) an anderson mit for weak interaction @xmath12 , where the ldos for spin up vanishes , and ( iii ) a falicov - kimball type mit , where the dos for spin down acquires a correlation gap .",
    "the correlated , disordered metallic phase borders on the mott insulator and the anderson localized phase , where the spin - up particles are localized while those with spin down are still itinerant . in the following we will refer to the latter phenomenon as  spin - selective localization  .",
    "the novel spin - selective localized phase originates from the spin dependence of the disorder . in the following",
    "we describe the properties of these three phases and characterize the transitions between them in detail .",
    "the correlated metallic phase is defined by a non - zero value of the geometrically averaged ldos at the fermi level , @xmath46 , for both spin channels . in the metallic phase without disorder ( @xmath47 ) @xmath48 corresponds to the non - interacting dos @xmath49 for both spins and arbitrary @xmath50 . in this case the luttinger theorem is obeyed and landau quasiparticles at the fermi level are well defined.@xcite in the presence of spin - dependent disorder , @xmath51 is reduced for particles in both spin channels , but differently depending in the spin direction . only for @xmath52",

    "spin - dependent disorder violates the luttinger pinning condition at any @xmath12 , and the local interaction can not restore the landau quasiparticle picture . as we will discuss later",

    "in contrast to conventional disorder,@xcite where the critical point is located at @xmath59 , the coexistence regime is found to be significantly smaller , and a crossover regime does not occur at all . these differences must be attributed to the reduced spin - symmetry in the present problem .",
    "namely , the quasiparticle central peak between the hubbard subbands , which originates from spin - flip scattering and thereby leads to the kondo resonance , is destroyed when a zeeman magnetic field is applied.@xcite the induced finite magnetization reduces the number of scattering states at the fermi level in different spin channels .",
