    "<S> doubly charged higgs s - channel resonances are analyzed in the @xmath0 process . in our analysis recent stringent constraint on an effective neutrino mass @xmath1 coming from neutrinoless double-@xmath2 decay is implemented . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that due to a very restrictive limit on @xmath1 the doubly charged higgs resonance predicted by the standard model with additional higgs triplets is below the detection limit . </S>",
    "<S> for the same reason also the @xmath3 resonance can not be visible in the framework of the conventional left - right symmetric model . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is quite different for the @xmath4 pole and large signal is possible here . </S>",
    "<S> contributions of the s , t and u channels to the cross section around the @xmath4 peak are also discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> = 5000 = 5000 = 1000    @twoside -17pt    eqnsel =    mathrm#1#1ifundefinedmathrm#1#1    1.2 cm    the @xmath5 process has most recently attracted some interest @xcite as a possible option for the detection of new physics in a future @xmath6 tev energy @xmath7 facility . </S>",
    "<S> this reaction itself involves many phenomena outside the scope of the standard model ( sm ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidently if the lepton number conservation is violated then even a single occurrence of this process would establish a departure from the sm . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of neutrino mass and its nature is also very closely connected with this process . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the detection of this reaction could give essential information about the existence of non - standard doubly charged higgs particles .    </S>",
    "<S> higgs fields are necessary for the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> although in the standard model based on the @xmath8 gauge group there is only one physical scalar higgs ( not observed yet ) , there is no restriction for existence of higher representations of su(2 ) for which other physical higgs particles appear . among them , a triplet representation @xmath9 that can generate a majorana mass for neutrinos is of special interest @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this triplet multiplet includes a doubly charged higgs field @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> its detection would be the clearest evidence for existence of such a representation in nature . </S>",
    "<S> until now we know for sure that @xmath10 with masses below @xmath11 are excluded by the lepi data @xcite . however , heavier ones can exist and the possibility of their detection both in the lepton @xcite and hadron @xcite colliders has already been examined . in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 colliders @xmath10 masses may be probed almost up to the collision energies @xcite . at hera ( @xmath14 collision , @xmath15 gev ) </S>",
    "<S> masses up to @xmath16 gev can be tested @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> both at the tevatron @xcite ( @xmath17 collider , @xmath18 tev ) and lhc @xcite,@xcite ( @xmath19 collider , @xmath20 tev ) @xmath10 can be found with masses up to 300 gev and up to @xmath21 tev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> so we can see that doubly charged higgs particles can be found in future @xmath19 , @xmath17 or @xmath12,@xmath13 colliders in advance of an @xmath7 option . </S>",
    "<S> the main feature of this option is that the @xmath7 initial state is doubly charged and carries a finite lepton number . </S>",
    "<S> thus sm activity is highly suppressed and clean signals from any non - standard physics can be looked for there . especially direct s - channel @xmath10 resonances are possible there . after discovering this particle in any other facility </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath7 collider could be still used as a @xmath10 factory that could precisely measure its mass , total decay width and couplings @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also possible that @xmath10 will be not found in future facilities discussed above so even its approximate mass will be not known . </S>",
    "<S> could still the @xmath7 collision be useful in this case ? </S>",
    "<S> we will also shortly discussed this situation later on . </S>",
    "<S> s - channel resonances would be established via @xmath10 decays . </S>",
    "<S> possible decay modes are @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we will focus here on the two gauge models where a non vanishing @xmath23 coupling can exist coupling is vanishing ) were discussed extensively in @xcite recently . ] :    \\(i ) the standard model with a higgs sector which contains a higgs - triplet in addition to the standard doublet higgs fields ( dtm ) @xcite ;    \\(ii ) the conventional left - right symmetric model ( lr ) @xcite .    for these models the @xmath5 process with the s channel exists .    </S>",
    "<S> the aim of this work is to investigate this process and to show how its @xmath10 resonance is connected ( and constrained ) by neutrinos which are present in the t and u channels . to our best knowledge </S>",
    "<S> a discussion of the @xmath5 process with doubly charged higgs particles has not been performed yet from the point of view of neutrino characteristic ( e.g. their possible mass spectrum , mixing angles with electron and cp parities ) .    in the lr model </S>",
    "<S> we have two doubly charged higgs particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for s - channel poles ( @xmath26 ) in the frame of this model can be written in the following way ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 stands for helicities of incoming electrons ) @xmath29 ^ 2   , \\ ] ]    @xmath30 ^ 2   .\\ ] ]    matrices @xmath31 are a part of the unitary matrix @xmath32 which diagonalize @xmath33 neutrino mass matrix m ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath34    it is important that these s - channel cross sections are proportional to elements of neutrino mass matrix reaction , a future @xmath35 collider could give us information about another two elements of the neutrino mass matrix m , e.g. @xmath36 and @xmath37 . ] </S>",
    "<S> @xmath38 the situation is akin to that in the @xmath39 process . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that for any realistic local gauge theory the existence of @xmath39 process implies that ( an effective ) electron neutrino must be of majorana type with a nonzero mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the @xmath5 process we can also recall another argument . </S>",
    "<S> a proper high energy behaviour of the cross section @xcite,@xcite demands that all three s , t and u channels are needed simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> that means that massive neutrinos must exist and they are exchanged in t and u channels .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40 angle is connected with diagonalization of the charged gauge boson mass matrix and can be expressed in the following way @xcite @xmath41    the full cross section with t and u channels will not be given here as it can be found in e.g. @xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the only important information we need to know is that the helicity amplitudes for t and u channels with exchanged neutrinos are not directly proportional to @xmath42 ( eqs.(1 - 3 ) ) because an additional neutrino mass relation comes from the neutrino propagator . </S>",
    "<S> however , for energies where the s - channel resonance appears these channels are negligible . </S>",
    "<S> outside the s - channel resonance they can be important and then both mixing matrix elements @xmath43 and masses @xmath44 must all be known separately .    in the frame of the tdm model </S>",
    "<S> we are restricted to a @xmath45 neutrino mass matrix @xmath46 @xcite and the cross section for the @xmath3 pole can be obtained from eq.(1 ) by putting @xmath47 ( that means that only left - handed currents exist ) .    </S>",
    "<S> let s proceed to numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> the dtm model predicts three massive neutrinos which can be identified with electron , muon and tau , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they enter to the formula on @xmath48 by the @xmath49 factor . </S>",
    "<S> however , this quantity is directly constrained by the absence of the @xmath50 decay . from experimental data </S>",
    "<S> an effective electron neutrino mass is extracted to be @xcite ( modified to our notation ) @xmath51 which implies that we do nt need to consider masses of all neutrinos and strength of their couplings with electron separately . to show how extremely strong this limit is </S>",
    "<S> let s take the @xmath3 resonance at cm energy equal to 200 gev ( @xmath52 gev = @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 gev . value of the width was adopted from @xcite where @xmath3 higgs lifetime has been analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> this value varies with @xmath55 ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 are vacuum expectation values for higgs triplet and doublet fields , respectively ) about one order of magnitude for @xmath58 .    </S>",
    "<S> the cross section is then @xmath59 unavoidably it is below detection level .    for larger energies ( and larger masses of doubly charged higgs particles ) the total width increases and the cross section at the @xmath3 pole is smaller than given in eq.(7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand the resonance would have to be extremely narrow ( @xmath60 kev ) if the signal were to be detectable ( @xmath61 fb ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that the @xmath3 resonance from the dtm model is under detection .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two doubly charged higgses ( @xmath62 ) in the lr model . from eqs.(2 ) and ( 6 ) we infer that situation for the @xmath3 resonance is quantitatively the same as in the dtm case </S>",
    "<S> .    however , situation is different for the @xmath4 resonance ( eq.(2 ) ) because @xmath63 is proportional to @xmath64 ( eq.(4 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account that @xmath65 and @xmath66 @xcite we have @xmath67 we can see ( eq.(2 ) ) that this factor can greatly enhance the resonance signal . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that this happens for + 1/2 helicity polarization of incoming electrons where the reduction factor @xmath68 is present so both factors must be examined simultaneously more carefully .    </S>",
    "<S> let s consider two versions of the left - right symmetric model , so - called manifest or quasi - manifest l - r symmetric model ( mlrs ) and non - manifest l - r symmetric model ( nmlrs ) . </S>",
    "<S> in the frame of nmlrs the present experimental bound on @xmath69 is not so high and @xmath70600 gev is still possible @xcite . however , for mlrs models the bound is larger , @xmath71 1600 gev @xcite . for these models in numerical discussion </S>",
    "<S> we use the lower limits .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 portrays results for the @xmath4 resonance ( @xmath72 ) for the nmlrs model . </S>",
    "<S> all lines are designed to maintain constant @xmath73 pb while changing @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> values of @xmath74 satisfy inequality ( 8) .    above these lines ( larger @xmath76 ) @xmath771 pb .    </S>",
    "<S> we can see from this figure that the reference level @xmath73 pb ( i.e. about @xmath78 times larger than ` the detection limit ' for this process @xcite ) can be easily achieved for @xmath79 gev for a wide range of @xmath74 and @xmath75 parameters . for @xmath69=1600 gev ( the mlr model ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath80 ( eq.(5 ) ) is smaller and to achieve the same values of @xmath63 much smaller values of @xmath76 are needed ( e.g. @xmath81 gev for @xmath82 tev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> fig.1 shows only optimistic , on - peak results . </S>",
    "<S> a question may arise how this situation looks like at the off - peak s - channel energy region where s - channel contribution is less pronounced and t and u channel contributions start to play a role . </S>",
    "<S> this case is discussed in fig.2 for @xmath83 gev with two parameters taken from the dotted line in fig.1 , i.e. @xmath84 gev and @xmath85 gev ( the asterisk ) . as it was already mentioned to make numerical calculations pertaining to off - peak energies we need to know not only the value of @xmath74 itself , as in the on - peak case ( eq.(2 ) ) , but also mixing matrix elements between heavy neutrinos and electron @xmath86 ( i=1,2,3 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that the mixing matrix element @xmath87 can be very large , @xmath88 ( see @xcite for theoretical and @xcite for practical realization of this situation ) . then , because of unitarity of the u mixing matrix other elements must fulfill the relation ( i=2,3 ) @xmath89    taking into account relevant experimental constraints on heavy neutrino mixing angles with electron @xcite,@xcite we can deduce ( see @xcite,@xcite for details ) that the maximal mixing between heavy neutrino and electron predicted by present data and the lr model is @xmath90 . in computations </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath91=0.001 .    </S>",
    "<S> as we can see from fig.2 for the discussed left - right model parameters , the contribution of the s channel to the total cross section is meaningful also outside the s channel resonance ( i.e. for @xmath92 ) . </S>",
    "<S> that means that also without knowledge about the mass of @xmath4 ( which can originate from other facilities ) we can try to look for it by fixing as many as possible energy settings to cover a wide range of possible @xmath4 masses ( i.e. for @xmath93 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> the gaussian shape of the @xmath94 spectrum depends on beamstrahlung / bremsstrahlung effects . for @xmath95 </S>",
    "<S> gev an average energy loss from these effects is estimated to be of the order of 3% and a gaussian peak can be controlled given pretty nice luminosity @xmath96 for a few years of running in its central 0.2% peak region ( i.e. for the gaussian rms resolution @xmath97 equals 1 gev ) @xcite . for @xmath98 information about </S>",
    "<S> the mass of @xmath4 particle would be desirable . </S>",
    "<S> otherwise we could measure a signal not at the central peak but at a tail of the @xmath94 spectrum where the luminosity would be not sufficient for getting an observable signal . for more details , among other things about predicted luminosities and beamstrahlung effects in the @xmath99 tev @xmath7 collisions , </S>",
    "<S> see e.g. @xcite . ] . </S>",
    "<S> similar plots can be obtained also for both larger and smaller energies , as long as considered energies are at or nearby the @xmath100 pole ( @xmath101 ) and mixing angle @xmath40 is large enough ( e.g. @xmath69 is not too massive ( eq.(5 ) ) . finally , let s note that as long as the s channel dominates over t and u channels we can hardly say anything about cp parities of heavy neutrinos ( the mixing angle of only one heavy neutrino with electron is important ( eq.(9 ) ) and then interferences with the other ones disappear @xcite ) .    in conclusion , we have shown , that due to a very precise bound on the effective neutrino mass @xmath1 taken from @xmath102 experiment , the s - channel resonance predicted by the dtm model is below detection in the @xmath5 process . </S>",
    "<S> the lr model opens a possibility for its detection , especially when the nmlr version of this model ( with a possible small value of the additional charged gauge boson @xmath69 ) is considered . </S>",
    "<S> then the @xmath4 higgs particle resonance is attainable for a wide range of doubly charged higgs masses and total widths . </S>",
    "<S> detecting this resonance would give also information that massive majorana neutrinos exist . </S>"
