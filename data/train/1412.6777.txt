    "significant progresses have been achieved recently in the study of products of random matrices , which have important applications in schrdinger operator theory @xcite , in statistical physics relating to disordered and chaotic dynamical systems @xcite and in wireless communication like mimo ( multiple - input and multiple - output ) networks @xcite .",
    "although the pioneering work of furstenberg and kesten @xcite focused on the statistical behavior of individual entries in the product as the number of factors tends to infinity , the recent interest of study lies in the distribution of eigenvalues and singular values of the product of a fixed number of matrices , where the sizes of the matrices tend to infinity .",
    "various methods have been applied to perform the spectral analysis in different regimes .",
    "particularly , the tools from free probability allow one to find the limiting mean eigenvalue distributions as in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that , as in the theory of matrix model for a single random matrix , the various limits exhibit a rich and interesting mathematical structure .",
    "most of the results in literature on the model of products of matrices are about the global spectral properties , but local universality is also suggested ( cf .",
    "our work is motivated by the previous results and proves the local universality of the squared singular values .    in this paper",
    ", we consider @xmath3 independent complex random matrices @xmath4 , @xmath5 , each has size @xmath6 with independent and identically distributed standard complex gaussian entries .",
    "these matrices are also known as complex ginibre random matrices .",
    "we then form the product @xmath7 for convenience , we assume that @xmath8 are associated to a large integer parameter @xmath9 , which we interchangeably denote by @xmath10 , such that @xmath11 and set @xmath12 clearly , @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath5 .    when @xmath15 , @xmath16 defines the complex wishart random matrix and plays a fundamental role in random matrix theory ; cf .",
    "it is well known that the eigenvalues and squared singular values of @xmath17 form determinantal point processes @xcite , and their distributions are expressed in terms of the correlation kernels .",
    "recent studies find the determinantal structures for the model with general @xmath0 ; see @xcite for the eigenvalues and @xcite for the squared singular values .",
    "moreover , further investigations reveal that similar determinantal structures also appear in many other models of products of random matrices , such as the products involving inverses of complex ginibre matrices @xcite and products involving truncated unitary matrices @xcite ; see also section [ sec : extensions ] below , and the recent review paper @xcite and references therein .",
    "we will focus on the squared singular values of @xmath18 . according to @xcite",
    ", the joint probability density function of the squared singular values is given by ( see ( * ? ? ?",

    "* formula ( 21 ) ) ) is @xmath23 note that the meijer g - function @xmath24 can be written as a mellin - barnes integral @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "the determinantal point process is a biorthogonal ensemble @xcite with correlation kernel @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29 matrix of moments @xmath30 alternatively , one can write the correlation kernel as @xmath31 where for each @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a monic polynomial of degree @xmath34 and @xmath35 is a linear combination of @xmath36 , uniquely defined by the orthogonality @xmath37 thus the functions @xmath33 and @xmath35 are the so - called biorthogonal functions .",
    "the polynomials @xmath33 are also characterized as multiple orthogonal polynomials @xcite with respect to the first @xmath0 weight functions @xmath38 , @xmath39 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that @xmath33 and @xmath35 are meijer g - functions @xcite , and then they have contour integral representations",
    ". then it is shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 5.1 ) that the correlation kernel admits the following double contour integral representation @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a closed contour going around @xmath42 in the positive direction and @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the choices of these two contours are not unique .",
    "we can , and indeed will , make some deformations in our later analysis .      the first step of the study of the correlation kernel is to compute the @xmath45-point correlation function , which is also known as the mean density of the model .",
    "this global result is also the basis of our proof of the local universality @xcite . as mentioned at the very beginning , the limiting mean density / spectral distribution of",
    "the squared singular values for @xmath18 is well understood using tools from free probability ; see also recent work @xcite for the study from the polynomials @xmath33 .",
    "it turns out that , after proper scaling , the limiting mean density is recognized as the fuss - catalan distribution @xcite , i.e. , its @xmath34-th moment is given by the fuss - catalan number @xmath46 the ( rescaled ) limiting mean density is supported on an interval @xmath47 $ ] , with explicit form given in terms of meijer g - functions @xcite or multivariate integrals @xcite .",
    "probably the simplest form of the density function for general @xmath0 is expressed by the following parametrization of the argument @xcite : @xmath48 it is readily seen that this parametrization is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath49 , thus gives a one - to - one mapping from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . the density function in terms of @xmath49",
    "is then given by @xmath52    from and , one can check ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that the density blows up with a rate @xmath53 near the origin ( hard edge ) , while vanishes as a square root near @xmath54 ( soft edge ) .",
    "these facts particularly suggest , as pointed out in @xcite , the classical bulk and soft edge universality ( via the sine kernel and airy kernel , respectively ) should hold in the bulk and the right edge respectively as in the @xmath55 case , that is , the complex wishart ensemble , but new limiting distributions are required to describe the local behavior at the hard edge if @xmath56 .",
    "the new limiting distributions , characterized by their limiting correlation kernels , were computed in @xcite by taking limit from the integral representation . here",
    "we note that the new family of kernels is a generalization of the classical bessel kernel @xcite which is the @xmath55 case of the family , and they are universal correlation kernels since they also appear in many other random models , including cauchy - chain matrix models @xcite , products of ginibre matrices with inverse ones @xcite , biorthogonal ensembles of borodin @xcite ( as shown in @xcite ) , etc . however , the conceptually simpler universality results in the bulk and at the right edge turn out to be technically more complicated and have been left open in @xcite .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to confirm the bulk and soft edge universality in the products of ginibre matrices @xmath18 .",
    "our main results are stated in the next section .",
    "we start with the definition of the sine kernel ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.1 ) ; here we take a different normalization ) : @xmath57 recall the correlation kernel @xmath58 given in , our first result is stated as follows :    [ thm : bulk ] for @xmath59 , which is parametrized through by @xmath60 , we have , with @xmath61 being fixed , @xmath62 uniformly for @xmath63 and @xmath64 in any compact subset of @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is defined in .",

    "* section 3.1 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are symmetric with respect to the imaginary axis , and @xmath68 is a contour in the right - half plane going from @xmath70 to @xmath71 ; see figure [ fig : airy_curve ] for an illustration .",
    "airy_curve.eps ( 15,88)@xmath69 ( 76,88)@xmath68    [ thm : edge ] with @xmath61 being fixed , we have @xmath72 uniformly for @xmath63 and @xmath64 in any compact subset of @xmath65 , where @xmath73    theorems [ thm : bulk ] and [ thm : edge ] then imply that the universal scaling limits of the correlation kernel ( in the bulk or at the soft edge ) that are typical for unitary random matrix ensembles also occur in products of complex ginibre random matrices .",
    "if we strengthen the result in theorem [ thm : edge ] from uniform convergence into the trace norm convergence of the integral operators with respect to the correlation kernels , then as a direct consequence we have that the limiting distribution of the largest squared singular value , after rescaling , converges to the tracy - widom distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.5 ) .",
    "since the proof of trace norm convergence is only a technical elaboration that confirms a well - expected result , we do not give the detail .",
    "our proof of the main theorems is based on a steepest descent analysis of the double contour integral , whose integrand contains products and ratios of gamma functions with large arguments . by stirling s formula ,",
    "the logarithms of the gamma functions are approximated by elementary functions for @xmath9 large , which play the role of phase function . in the bulk regime",
    "there are two complex conjugate saddle points , while in the edge regime these two saddle points coalesce into one . the main challenge of the proof is to find suitable contours of integration and sophisticated estimates of integrals .",
    "as we shall see later , the parametrization will be essential in the analysis .",
    "our strategy can be generalized to deal with some other product models introduced recently , where the correlation kernels have similar structures .",
    "we will also discuss about this aspect at the end of this paper .",
    "here we note that the steepest descent analysis of a double contour integral involving gamma functions was used in a different random matrix model in @xcite , where the limiting pearcey kernel was derived .",
    "the preprint @xcite that considers a random matrix model similar to that in @xcite applies the method detailed in this paper to perform asymptotic analysis .",
    "see also @xcite .    the rest of this paper",
    "is organized as follows .",
    "theorems [ thm : bulk][thm : edge ] are proved in section [ sec : proofs ] , upon two technical lemmas that are proved in section [ sec : contconst ] on the properties of the specially deformed integral contours .",
    "section [ sec : contconst ] also contains the precise construction of the deformed contours .",
    "we conclude this paper in section [ sec : extensions ] with a discussion on the generalizations of our method to establish similar universal results in other models of products of random matrices .",
    "we present two more examples , one is the product of @xmath0 ginibre matrices and the inverse of @xmath1 ginibre matrices studied by forrester @xcite , and the other one is the product of @xmath2 ginibre matrices with one truncated unitary matrix considered by kuijlaars and stivigny @xcite .",
    "for notational simplicity , we set @xmath74 where the logarithm takes the principal branch and we assume that the value of @xmath75 for @xmath76 is continued from above .",
    "the asymptotics of @xmath77 is crucial in our analysis . to proceed , note the stirling s formula for gamma function ( * ?",
    "* formula 5.11.1 ) reads @xmath78 as @xmath79 in the sector @xmath80 for some @xmath81 .",
    "hence it follows that if @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while @xmath84 and @xmath85 are in @xmath86 , then uniformly @xmath87 where @xmath88 furthermore , we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 the behaviour of @xmath91 is crucial in the saddle point analysis in this paper , and we plot the level line @xmath92 in figure [ fig : level_set ] , where @xmath93 are the critical points of @xmath94 , see and .    to prove the results of universality , we also need to deform the contours in .",
    "first we note that the integral contour for @xmath95 can be replaced by any infinite contour @xmath96 that is taken to go from @xmath97 to @xmath98 , as long as @xmath41 is on the right side of @xmath96 .",
    "thus ( with shorthand notation @xmath77 defined in ) , we express as @xmath99    in the proof of the soft edge universality , we will further deform @xmath96 in such that @xmath41 is on its left , and it turns out that the resulting double contour integral remains the same . to see this ,",

    ", it follows @xmath102 hence , the double contour integral does not change if @xmath96 is replaced by @xmath100 .",
