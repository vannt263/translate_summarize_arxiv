    "we observed in may 2003 . at the european southern observatory in chile we used uves ( uv - visual echelle spectrograph ) at the 8.2-m unit telescope  2 of the very large telescope ( vlt ) . at siding spring observatory in australia we used ucles ( university college london echelle spectrograph ) at the 3.9-m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) . in both cases ,",

    "note that , unlike for our observations of , ucles was used in standard planet - search mode . for we rotated the ccd by 90 degrees to speed up readout time , but found that this introduced drifts and sudden jumps in the velocities that we believe to be related to the movement of the ccd dewar as liquid nitrogen boiled off and",
    "was refilled @xcite .",

    "[ fig.series ] , and the effects of bad weather can be seen ( we were allocated five nights with the vlt and eight with the aat ) .",

    "this process of high - pass filtering is not strictly necessary , but it does slightly reduce the noise leaking into higher frequencies that would otherwise degrade the oscillation spectrum .",
    "note that fourier analysis on unevenly spaced data can not use the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm .",

    "the velocities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.dpav.series ] and there is a clear periodicity of about 7min . we did not expect to be able to measure frequencies with such a limited data set , but we do see a clear excess in the power spectrum from the oscillations ( fig .",

    "[ sec.amp ] .",
    "our analysis of the velocities for follows the method that we developed for @xcite .",
    "we have used the measurement uncertainties , @xmath5 , as weights in calculating the power spectrum ( according to @xmath6 ) , but modified some of the weights to account for a small fraction of bad data points . in this case , only three data points from uves and none from ucles needed to be down - weighted .",
    "after these adjustments , we measured the average noise in the amplitude spectrum at high frequencies ( above the stellar signal ) to be 1.49 for uves ( 68mhz ) and 4.28 for ucles ( 4.755.50mhz ) .",
    "note that we used a lower frequency range to measure the noise in the ucles data because the sampling time of those observations was significantly longer than for uves ( see above ) .",
    "the power spectrum of the combined series is shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .",
    "we refer to this as the noise - optimized power spectrum because the weights have been chosen to minimize the noise .",
    "the noise level in amplitude is 1.39 ( 68mhz ) . as such ,",
    "these measurements replace our observations of ( 1.9 ) as the most precise amplitude spectrum obtained on any star apart from the sun .    the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] shows a close - up of the noise - optimized power spectrum .",
    "there is a clear series of regular peaks with a spacing of about 81 , and we therefore confirm that the large separation is about 162 , in agreement with the value reported by @xcite .",
    "the inset shows the spectral window , in which we see prominent sidelobes ( 38% in power ) due to gaps in the observing window .    as for",
    ", we have also generated a power spectrum in which the weights were adjusted on a night - by - night basis in order to to minimize the sidelobes .",
    "the result , which we refer to as the sidelobe - optimized power spectrum , is shown in the bottom panel of the figure .",
    "the values for these weight multipliers were : 1.0 for all ucles nights except the last , which had 0.8 ; and 3.2 , 3.2 , 2.3 and 2.3 for the four uves nights .",
    "adjusting the weights in this way increased the noise level to 2.40 ( 68mhz ) , but allowed us to identify correctly peaks that might otherwise be obscured by sidelobes from their stronger neighbours ( now reduced to 13% in power ) .",
    "in addition , the sidelobe minimization has slightly improved the frequency resolution , with the fwhm of the spectral window decreasing by about 20% ( from 1.83 to 1.44 ) .",
    "this is because of the increased weight given to the ucles data , which covers the longer timespan .",
    "note that the dotted lines in fig .",

    "we measured the frequencies of the strongest peaks in the power spectrum in the standard way , using iterative sine - wave fitting .",
    "we did this for both the noise - optimized and the sidelobe - optimized power spectra , and the resulting frequencies are plotted in echelle format in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle ] .",
    "the echelle format takes advantage of the fact that mode frequencies for low - degree p - mode oscillations are approximated reasonably well by the asymptotic relation : @xmath7 here @xmath8 ( the radial order ) and @xmath9 ( the angular degree ) are integers , @xmath10 ( the large separation ) reflects the average stellar density , @xmath11 is sensitive to the sound speed near the core and @xmath12 is sensitive to the surface layers .",

    "the dotted lines represent a fit to the final frequencies that is discussed below ; in this figure , they serve to guide the eye and allow us to identify ridges with angular degrees of @xmath0 , 1 , 2 and  3 .",
    "we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle ] that many peaks were identified in both versions of the power spectrum and , not surprisingly , many were only above snr @xmath14 in the noise - optimized version . however , four peaks that were only significant in the sidelobe - optimized version lie close to the oscillation ridges ( three with @xmath0 and one with @xmath15 ) .",
    "the detection of these peaks vindicates our decision to examine the sidelobe - optimized power spectrum .",
    "the next step was to select those peaks that we believe are due to oscillations and reject those due to noise .",
    "this is the only subjective part of the process , but is required if we are to measure as many frequencies as possible from our data because at this snr , not all the extracted peaks will be genuine .",

    "[ fig.echelle.final ] and table  [ tab.freqs ] ( and also indicated by the dotted lines in fig .",

    "we have been conservative in not selecting three peaks outside the main region because we can not be sure of the curvature of the extrapolated ridge lines .",
    "these are : 2827.7 ( @xmath0 ? ) , 5894.9 ( @xmath16 ? ) and 5973.1 ( @xmath15 ? ) .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] shows some apparent mismatches between the peaks in the power spectrum and the dotted lines representing the extracted frequencies .",
    "for example , there are enhancements in power at 3600 , 3700 and 4050 that do not correspond to identified modes .",
    "we noted similar structures in our analysis of @xcite and the explanation is the same : the interaction of the window function with noise peaks and oscillation peaks .",
    "we have verified that the same phenomenon occurs in solar data by analysing segments of the publically - available 805-day series of full - disk velocity observations taken by the golf instrument ( global oscillations at low frequencies ) on the soho spacecraft @xcite , which have a sampling time of 80s .",
    "we applied the same sampling window as our observations of and the results showed low - level structure in the power spectrum similar to those in fig .",
    "[ fig.power ] .",
    "this confirms that such a structure is a natural consequence of the spectral window interacting with multi - mode oscillations having finite lifetimes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle.final ] the open squares show the frequencies reported by @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , while they found the correct large separation , there is a shift in their frequencies of one cycle per day ( 11.57 ) .",
    "this reflects the problem associated with single - site observations , especially when the peaks have low signal - to - noise .    as with",
    ", we note a scatter of the peaks about the ridge lines that is much higher than expected from snr considerations and which we interpret as being due to the finite lifetime of the modes .",
    "we therefore fit to the ridges , in order to obtain more accurate estimates for the eigenfrequencies of the star .",
    "in the case of @xcite we fitted to the frequencies in a two - step process by first fitting the three small separations and then fitting a parabola to the individual frequencies .",
    "here , we adopted a simpler approach that gives almost identical results , in which we fitted directly to the frequencies ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the nine fitted parameters specify : the curvatures of the parabolas ( one common value ) , the large separation at some reference frequency for each  @xmath9 ( four values ) and the absolute positions of the ridges ( four values ) .",
    "the equations for this fit are as follows : @xmath17\\,{\\mbox{$\\mu$hz}}\\label{eq.nu0}\\\\   \\nu_{n,1 } & = & \\left[4026.23 + 161.28 \\;(n - 23 ) + 0.101 \\;(n-23)^2\\right]\\,{\\mbox{$\\mu$hz}}\\label{eq.nu1}\\\\   \\nu_{n,2 } & = & \\left[4101.41 + 161.63 \\;(n - 23 ) + 0.101 \\;(n-23)^2\\right]\\,{\\mbox{$\\mu$hz}}\\label{eq.nu2}\\\\   \\nu_{n,3 } & = & \\left[4171.13 + 161.76 \\;(n - 23 ) + 0.101 \\;(n-23)^2\\right]\\,{\\mbox{$\\mu$hz}}.\\label{eq.nu3 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we show this fit as the dotted curves in figs .",

    "thus , @xmath19 is the separation between adjacent peaks with @xmath0 and @xmath16 and @xmath20 is the separation between @xmath15 and @xmath21 .",
    "the third small separation , @xmath22 , is the amount by which @xmath15 modes are offset from the midpoint between the @xmath0 modes on either side : @xmath23 since one could equally well define @xmath22 to be the offset of @xmath0 modes from the midpoint between consecutive @xmath15 modes , @xmath24 we have shown both versions in fig .",
    "[ fig.separations ] ( upper panel ) .",
    "note that @xmath11 , which is sensitive to the stellar core , corresponds to @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 and is a constant if the asymptotic relation holds exactly .",
    "the solid lines in the top and bottom panels show the separations calculated from the fitted equations ( in the bottom panel , only @xmath28 is shown ; lines for other @xmath9 values are almost indistinguishable ) .",
    "the upward trend of @xmath18 with frequency is responsible for the curvature in the echelle diagram .    in table",

    "see equation  ( [ eq.asymptotic ] ) .",
    "we are not able to detect any statistically significant variations in the large separation with angular degree ( @xmath9 ) ; the weighted mean value ( @xmath18 ) has an uncertainty of 0.04% .",
    "we also find that the value of @xmath11 ( as defined above ) at 4.0mhz is the same within uncertainties for all three small separations , and our mean value for @xmath11 has an uncertainty of 3% .",
    "we can therefore place in the so - called asteroseismic h - r diagram ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ) , and these frequency separations should be compared with theoretical models .",
    "detailed modelling of the system was carried out by @xcite .",
    "they determined the parameters of the system through a least - squares fit to the observed quantities , including both ` classical ' photometric and spectroscopic data and oscillation frequencies from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "their two preferred models ( models m1 and m2 ) both have an age of 6.5gyr . for they obtained large separations @xmath29 of 161.7 and 161.1 , respectively , while the @xmath3 to 2 small separations were @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively ; both are essentially consistent with the values found here ( cf .  table  [ tab.splittings ] ) , although with some slight preference for model m1 .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the average values of these quantities depend on the detailed way in which the averages are computed , including the selection of modes . also , the computed values of @xmath29 , and to a lesser extent @xmath32 , are affected by the uncertain physics of the near - surface layers of the model .",
    "an analysis of the combined set of frequencies for , presented by @xcite , and the results of shown in table  [ tab.freqs ] is in progress .",
    "we now describe a method that allows us to measure the oscillations at low snr , outside the central region in which we can identify individual modes .",
    "this allows us to examine curvature in the echelle diagram , which corresponds to measuring the large separation as a function of frequency .",
    "the method relies on smoothing the power spectrum in order to increase the contrast between the oscillation signal and the background noise .",
    "the first step was to smooth the power spectrum quite heavily , with a fwhm of @xmath33 .",
    "this type of smoothing was used by @xcite to find high - frequency peaks in the solar power spectrum , but here we use an even broader smoothing function .",
    "the smoothing combines the power from each even - degree pair of modes ( @xmath0 and 2 ) into a single resolution element , and the same applies to the odd - degree pairs ( @xmath15 and  3 ) .",
    "we next arranged the smoothed power spectrum in echelle format , with frequencies reduced modulo @xmath34 rather than the conventional @xmath18 .",
    "this causes power associated with odd and even pairs to line up , allowing us to smooth in the vertical direction in this echelle diagram to improve the contrast further ( for this smoothing we used fwhm = @xmath35 ) . finally , we measured the highest peak in each half - order and these are marked by the open circles in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle.smoothed ] .",
    "we see a clear ridge of power that extends well beyond the central region .",
    "the dotted lines are the fits shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle.final ] and given by equations  ( [ eq.nu0])([eq.nu3 ] ) .",
    "we see good agreement in the central region , but the smoothed data allow us to measure curvature well outside the region in which we were able to identified individual oscillation modes .    in order to evaluate this method , we have also applied it to the oscillations in the sun by analysing the 805-day golf series ( see sec .",

    "the figure also shows published solar frequencies for @xmath03 @xcite .",
    "we see that the ridge of power follows the published frequencies very well , but again extends beyond them at high frequencies .",
    "it is interesting that our measurements at high frequency match up perfectly with the so - called pseudo - modes , also called hips ( high - frequency interference peaks ) , which have been seen in smoothed solar power spectra up to 7.5mhz @xcite",
    ". this may be relevant to the discussion of the physical nature of these hips : are they related to ordinary resonant p modes , despite having frequencies above the acoustic cut - off frequency in the atmosphere , and caused by small but non - zero reflectivity at the photosphere @xcite ; or are they resonances between direct and reflected waves from a localized source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ?    the points in fig .",
    "[ fig.large.sep ] show the large separation as a function of frequency for both and the sun .",
    "these values were derived from figs .",
    "[ fig.echelle.smoothed ] and  [ fig.echelle.solar ] , respectively , simply by doubling the differences between consecutive points along the ridges .",
    "the two curves are remarkably similar , except for the pronounced dip at 6mhz in , which occurs in the region of low s / n and which we suspect is not real .",
    "in fact , our tests show that this type of feature sometimes appears as an artifact when the method is applied to short segments of the solar golf data ( to match the observing window of ) .",
    "the same tests also show that the method does measure @xmath18 very accurately in the regions where oscillations have significant amplitude .",
    "to illustrate this , the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.large.sep ] show our best estimates , based on these tests , of the @xmath36 uncertainties in @xmath18 .",
    "we conclude that this is a powerful technique for measuring the large separation over an extended frequency range . for",
    "this will provide extra constraints on theoretical models while , for the sun , we have been able to measure @xmath18 to much higher frequencies than has been done previously .",
    "the s - shaped structure in the echelle diagram indicates a departure from the second - order fit used in equations  ( [ eq.nu0])([eq.nu3 ] ) , implying that cubic ( or higher ) terms are needed to describe the frequencies fully .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , these higher - order coefficients might be useful in constraining the stellar mass .",
    "the scatter of the observed frequencies about the ridges allows us to estimate the mode lifetimes . in the case of we",
    "did this by measuring the deviations of the measured frequencies from the fitted relations and comparing with simulations @xcite .",
    "here we adopted a slightly different approach that has the advantage of being independent of the fit , although it does still assume that we have correctly assigned @xmath8 and  @xmath9 values .",
    "for each measured frequency  @xmath37 ( solid points in fig .",
    "[ fig.echelle.final ] ) , except those at the ends of the ridges , we calculated the difference  @xmath38 between the measured frequency and that expected from the positions of the two nearest neighbours on the same ridge , using linear interpolation : @xmath39 here , the two neighbouring modes lie in orders @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively . in most cases ,",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 are  1 , but in some cases one or both is 2 or even  3 .",
    "we therefore need to convert @xmath38 to a quantity that we can easily compare with simulations .",
    "we choose this to be the rms scatter of that peak about its expected position , calculated as follows : @xmath44    averaging @xmath45 over many peaks gives an estimate of the mode lifetime , but we must keep in mind that the finite snr also introduces a scatter to the peak positions . to calibrate these two contributions",
    ", we carried out a large number of simulations ( 175000 ) , each with a single input frequency and each sampled with our observational window function ( with the noise - optimized weights ) .",
    "we used the method described by @xcite to generate the time series of an oscillation that was re - excited continuously with random kicks and damped on a timescale that was an adjustable parameter ( the mode lifetime ) .",
    "the other adjustable input parameter was the oscillation amplitude , while the mode frequency and the noise level were fixed .",
    "we made 100 simulations for each set of input parameters and from the resulting power spectra we measured the rms scatter in frequency of the highest peak and its mean snr ( discarding peaks with frequencies more than @xmath46 from actual value ) .",

    "the revised values are higher , although the @xmath55 error bars do overlap .",
    "the reason for the change is that our previous calculation underestimated the contribution of snr to the frequency scatter .",
    "we did of course include the effects of snr , but did so by treating it as being independent of the scatter introduced by finite mode lifetimes .",
    "in fact , as our new simulations show , the two contributions are not independent .",
    "if they were , the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig.lifetime.snr ] would not rise towards low snr as steeply as they do .    the important conclusion , as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig.lifetime.freq ] , is that mode lifetimes in are not substantially lower than those in the sun , although the value for the lower frequency range is still about  @xmath56 below solar .",
    "it is important to measure oscillation amplitudes in solar - like stars and to compare these with theoretical calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is also interesting to measure the background noise from stellar convection , although in velocity this requires extremely precise measurements because the signature is weak .",
    "for both these measurements , we have chosen to smooth the power spectrum heavily , so as to produce a single hump of excess power that is insensitive to the fact that the oscillation spectrum has discrete peaks .",
    "it is also useful to convert to power density , which is independent of the observing window and therefore allows us to compare noise levels .",

    "[ fig.pd ] are fits to the noise backgrounds , based on the @xcite model of solar granulation .",
    "the harvey model gives a convenient functional form , even in stars where the low - frequency noise has a strong additional contribution from instrumental noise .",
    "we discuss the noise levels in more detail below .",
    "first , we show that these smoothed power density spectra provide a powerful way to measure oscillation amplitudes in a way that is independent of mode lifetime .    to do this , we first subtracted the background noise ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig.pd ] ) from each observed power density spectrum .",
    "we only included those parts of the spectrum that were at least twice the noise level . in order to calculate the amplitude per oscillation mode ,",
    "we should then multiply by @xmath33 ( where @xmath18 is the large frequency separation of the star ) and take the square root .",
    "the rationale for this is that there are four modes in each segment of length @xmath18 ( with @xmath0 , 1 , 2 and  3 ) .",
    "however , we must keep in mind that modes with different angular degrees have different visibilities in full - disk observations , due to varying amounts of cancellation .",
    "based on the results presented by @xcite , we calculated the effective number of modes per @xmath18 , normalised to the mean of the @xmath0 and @xmath15 amplitudes , to be 3.0 .",
    "we therefore used this factor , rather than 4 , in our calculation .    for @xmath18 we used the following values : 135 for the sun ; 106 for ; 162 for ; 56 for and 93 for .",
    "the last of these is not a measurement , since none is available , and is instead derived from the following adopted parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59k .",
    "our amplitude estimates are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.amps ] , and the height , frequency and fwhm of the envelopes are given in table  [ tab.amps ] .",
    "we see a number of interesting things from figs .",
    "[ fig.pd ] and  [ fig.amps ] .",
    "looking first at the sun , the results illustrate very nicely that the solar oscillation amplitude depends on the spectral line that is being measured ( see @xcite for a recent study of this phenomenon ) .",
    "the sodium line used by golf is formed higher in the solar atmosphere than the potassium line used by bison , which is why golf measures higher oscillation amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the actual height difference is difficult to estimate ; @xcite quoted @xmath60200 km while @xcite adopted @xmath6060 km .",
    "velocity measurements of other stars are made using a wide wavelength range so as to include many spectral lines , and the doppler signal is dominated by neutral iron lines . since these lines are formed about 400 km below the sodium d lines @xcite , we would expect solar amplitudes measured using the iodine technique to be less than those from both bison and golf .",
    "unfortunately , there do not appear to be any published estimates of the solar oscillation amplitude using the stellar technique .",
    "here we present some previously unpublished observations of the solar spectrum made using iodine referencing .",
    "one of us ( j.t.w . ) made observations of the moon using the 0.6 m coude auxilliary telescope ( cat ) at lick observatory , which fed the hamilton spectrometer , a high - resolution ( @xmath61 ) echelle @xcite .",
    "the cat tracked a fixed point of uniform surface brightness ( archimedes crater ) for five consecutive nights near full moon , thus measuring the disk - integrated solar spectrum at night ( a technique inspired by @xcite ) .",
    "these velocity measurements allowed us to estimate the solar oscillation amplitude , which we include in fig .",
    "[ fig.amps ] and table  [ tab.amps ] .",
    "the results support the conclusion that fe  i measurements give lower amplitudes than both golf and bison .",
    "they also place the solar amplitude between those of and  b , as would be expected given their stellar parameters .",
    "it would clearly be valuable to obtain more measurements of the sun , in order to better calibrate the relationship between stellar and solar amplitudes .",
    "the method described here allows us to estimate amplitudes independently of mode lifetime and observing window .",
    "comparing the amplitudes of different stars with theoretical models is the subject of a future paper .",
    "we turn now to the noise levels in the various observations , looking first at low frequencies .",
    "the rise in power towards low frequencies seen in fig .",
    "[ fig.pd ] is due to a combination of instrumental drift and stellar background noise .",
    "of course , it is very difficult to distinguish between these two , although in the sun it is established the solar background is dominant .",
    "it therefore seems likely that the low - frequency power from is also mostly stellar , given the power density is similar to the sun ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the same may also be true for .",
    "we can certainly say that at 1mhz , the granulation noise in both stars is no greater than is observed in the sun by golf and bison .    at the highest frequencies",
    "the noise levels are dominated by white noise from photon statistics .",
    "we can see that the power density ( which indicates noise per unit observing time ) is lowest for bison and golf , followed by ( uves ) and ( uves ) . in the last two columns of table  [ tab.amps ] we provide an update to table  1 of @xcite , showing the noise per minute of observing at frequencies just above the p - mode envelope ( @xmath62 ) and also , where the sampling allows , at very high frequencies ( 11mhz ) .",
    "we should note that the power at high frequencies in the sun ( 46mhz ) , particularly in the sodium line used by golf , is dominated by solar noise that presumably arises from chromospheric effects , with only a small fraction being due to coherent p - modes .",
    "our observations of from two sites have allowed us to identify 37 oscillation modes with @xmath0@xmath1 .",
    "fitting to these modes gave the large and small frequency separations as a function of frequency .",
    "we also introduced a new method , involving smoothing in the @xmath63 echelle diagram , that allowed us to trace the ridges of power , and hence measure the large separation , well beyond the central region .",
    "we inferred the mode lifetimes in two frequency ranges by measuring the scatter of the oscillation frequencies about a smooth trend , based on a calibration involving extensive simulations .",
    "we found mode lifetimes in , when considered as a function of frequency relative to the maximum power , that are consistent with those seen in the sun .",
    "we applied the same analysis to our observations of and deduced revised mode lifetimes that are slightly higher than we previously published @xcite .",
    "a limited set of observations of the star showed oscillations centred at 2.3mhz with peak velocity amplitudes close to solar .",
    "further observations are needed to determine the large separation and individual mode frequencies in this star .",
    "finally , we also introduced a new method of measuring oscillation amplitudes from heavily - smoothed power density spectra .",
    "we estimated the amplitude per mode of  and  b , , and the sun , and pointed out that the results may depend on which spectral lines are used for the velocity measurements .",
