    "a subgroup of carbon stars , the ch stars , were first distinguished from other carbon stars 60 years ago ( @xcite ) .",
    "their chief characteristics are : strong ch absorption lines , strong swan bands of c@xmath0 , strong resonance lines of ba  ii and sr  ii ( later shown to reflect genuine overabundances of s - process elements ) , weak lines of the iron - group elements and high proper motion .",
    "since it was shown that all field ch stars were spectroscopic binaries ( @xcite ) , the binary scenario was accepted : ch stars have been polluted by a nearby companion , formerly on the agb , now a defunct white dwarf .",
    "but some recent results have cast doubts on this general picture .",
    "conflicting evidences include the radial velocity monitoring of targets from the hk survey ( @xcite ) which show no radial velocity variations ( @xcite ) , and the discovery of carbon but not s - process enhanced stars ( e.g. @xcite ) . furthermore , the unexpectedly high fraction of carbon - enhanced stars among metal - poor stars discovered in the hk survey ( about 25% in the metallicity range [ fe / h ] @xmath1 -2.5 compared to 1 - 2 % among stars of higher metal abundances ) , make them crucial for the study of the early stages of galaxy evolution .    l|c|c|c|c star & t@xmath2 & log  g & [ fe / h ] & @xmath3c/@xmath4c + cs 22891 - 171 & 5100 & 1.8 & -2.31 & 5 + cs 22942 - 019 & 5100 & 2.5 & -2.48 & 7 + cs 22945 - 017 * & 6400 & 4.3 & -2.60 & 4 + cs 22953 - 003 & 4600 & 1.0 & -3.27 & @xmath55 + cs 22956 - 028 * & 6700 & 3.5 & -2.38 & 3 + cs 30322 - 023 & 4000 & 0.0 & -3.78 & 5 + hd 26 * & 5200 & 2.6 & -0.71 & ? + hd 5424 * & 5000 & 3.0 & -0.41 & 4 + hd 24035 * & 5000 & 3.7 & 0.16 & 4 + hd 168214 & 5200 & 3.5 & -0.03 & ? + hd 187861 * & 4800 & 1.8 & -2.21 & 10 + hd 196944 * & 5250 & 1.7 & -2.21 & ? + hd 206983 & 4550 & 1.6 & -0.93 & 4 + hd 207585 * & 5800 & 4.0 & -0.35 & 10 + hd 211173 & 4800 & 2.5 & -0.17 & 13 + hd 218875 & 4600 & 1.5 & -0.63 & 100 + hd 219116 & 4800 & 1.8 & -0.45 & 7 + hd 224959 * & 5000 & 2.0 & -2.08 & 7 + he 1419 - 1324 & 4900 & 1.8 & -3.28 & 4 + he 1410 + 0213 * & 4550 & 1.0 & -2.38 & 4 + he 1001 - 0243 * & 5000 & 2.3 & -3.12 & 30 +   +",
    "we have started a new extensive high - resolution analysis of carbon - enhanced stars , based on a sample including at the moment 86 stars , aimed at investigating the c - enrichment phenomenon over a wide range of metallicities , chosen in the barktevicius catalog ( 1996 ) , in the hk survey and in the hamburg / eso survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were made with the vlt / uves echelle spectrograph at high s / n and spectral resolution , as well as with the eso 1m52/feros spectrograph .",

    "the gravity was determined from the ionization equilibrium of fe  i and fe  ii .",

    "the combined ( c+n)/fe overabundance is much larger at lower metallicity , pointing towards a primary origin of these elements .",
    "@xcite warns for 3d effects that may lead to overestimates of abundances derived from molecular lines in metal - poor stars , but we doubt that the trend could be erased by nlte and 3d effects .",
    "+ ba is an s - process element and , as for carbon , its overabundance is explained by mass - transfer from a now extinct agb star .",

    "in addition to a few stars that are very enriched in both r- and s - process elements , two groups emerge : one enriched in eu and not in ba , and a large group of stars with [ ba / fe ] around + 1 , and no or little eu enhancement . this latter group encompasses the solar metallicity ba stars present in our sample .",
    "+ the carbon - rich , very iron - poor stars are of various origins : ( i ) mass - transfer binaries polluted by an agb or a more massive star , ( ii ) single stars , some enriched in s - process elements , other in r - process elements , some maybe in both .",
