    "massive stars of @xmath28 - 40@xmath4 spend a short time in between the hot and cool extremes of the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) as tepid supergiants ( ba - type sgs , @xmath3@xmath28000 - 15000k ) .",
    "possible scenarios are the first crossing from blue to red after the main sequence phase , blue loop episodes or a final crossing from red to blue in a late evolution stage close to the final supernova explosion .    important observational constraints on the evolution of massive stars can be derived from studies of tepid sgs via the determination of stellar parameters and abundance patterns for light elements . in particular ,",
    "enriched helium and nitrogen , and depleted carbon are indicative for the mixing of nuclear - processed matter from the stellar core to the atmosphere .",
    "recent models of massive star evolution accounting for mass loss and rotation @xcite and the interplay of rotation and magnetic fields @xcite provide detailed predictions on the expected effects of chemical mixing on surface abundances .",
    "systematic investigations of massive stars of different mass and metallicity can provide the necessary observational constraints to distinguish between competing treatments of the complex ( magneto)hydrodynamic processes , which are not fully understood from first principles .",
    "these processes redistribute angular momentum , transport nuclear - processed products from the core to the surface and replenish hydrogen , thus extending lifetimes and increasing the stellar luminosity .    here",
    "we report results from _ precision analyses _ of galactic tepid supergiants and a control sample of unevolved b - type stars in the solar neighbourhood , i.e. the progenitors of ba - type sgs .",
    "the derived observational constraints are confronted with present - day model predictions and the conclusions from this may guide future refinements to stellar evolution models .",
    "high - s / n and high - resolution echelle spectra ( @xmath5@xmath6200,@xmath7=@xmath8@xmath940 - 48000 ) of galactic ba - sgs and unevolved b - type stars were obtained using feros on the eso la silla 1.5m/2.2 m and foces on the calar alto 2.2 m telescopes . the wide wavelength coverage ( @xmath23900 - 9200 ) provided access to all spectroscopic indicators required for the quantitative analysis .",
    "the model calculations were carried out in a hybrid non - lte approach as discussed in detail by @xcite and @xcite . in brief , hydrostatic ,",
    "plane - parallel and line - blanketed lte model atmospheres were computed with atlas9 ( kurucz  1993 ; with further modifications : przybilla , butler & kudritzki  2001 ) and non - lte line formation was performed on the resulting model stratifications with detail and surface ( giddings  1981 ; butler & giddings  1985 ; both updated by k. butler ) .",
    "the former solves the coupled radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations while the latter performs the formal solution with refined line - broadening theories .",
    "state - of - the - art non - lte model atoms relying on data from _ ab - initio _ computations  avoiding rough approximations wherever possible  were utilised",
    ".    the stellar parameter and abundance determination for ba - sgs and unevolved b stars relied on the iterative analysis methodology described by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "numerous spectroscopic indicators like multiple ionization equilibria and stark - broadened profiles of the higher balmer and paschen lines were simultaneously used to derive effective temperatures @xmath3 and surface gravities @xmath10 .",
    "the accuracy of the method allows the 1@xmath11-uncertainties to be reduced to @xmath21 - 2% in @xmath3 and to 0.05 - 0.10dex in @xmath10 , when the atmospheric helium content , metallicity and microturbulence are correctly accounted for in a self - consistent way .",
    "absolute elemental abundances can then be constrained with unprecedented accuracy ( @xmath21020% , random , and @xmath225% , systematic 1@xmath11-errors ; see also nieva & przybilla , these proceedings ) .",
    "it is well established that metallicity plays an important rle in the evolution of massive stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "most evolution models representative for the massive star population in the solar neighbourhood assume a value of ( solar ) metal mass fraction of @xmath0@xmath10.02 .",
    "slowly - rotating unevolved early b - type stars were long since recognised as best targets for elemental abundance determinations at present day , as they show the simplest photospheres among the massive stars .",
    "they even allow pristine abundances for helium , carbon and nitrogen to be derived .",
    "all previous studies of early b - type stars in the solar neighbourhood found a wide scatter in abundances  and therefore metallicity  , favouring overall sub - solar values , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "llll he : 10.98@xmath120.02 & c : 8.35@xmath120.05 & n : 7.76@xmath120.05 & o : 8.76@xmath120.03 + @xmath13@xmath10.715 & @xmath14@xmath10.271 & @xmath0@xmath10.014 +    in the meantime , improvements in model atmosphere analyses of cool stars lead to a revision of the solar abundances @xcite .",
    "a wide range of systematic effects on quantitative analyses of early b stars have also been identified ( nieva & przybilla , these proceedings ) , providing a sound basis for a re - investigation of elemental abundances in these stars .",
    "this re - investigation indicates that elemental abundances of early b stars in the solar neighbourhood are in fact highly homogeneous , showing a rms scatter as low as @xmath210% @xcite , the same as reported for ism gas - phase abundances .",
    "a _ cosmic abundance standard _ for the present - day solar neighbourhood can thus be proposed , with light element abundances ( given as log(el",
    "/ h)@xmath1512 ) and mass fractions for hydrogen ( @xmath13 ) , helium ( @xmath14 ) and metals ( @xmath0 ) as summarised in table  [ cas ] . here ,",
    "pristine carbon abundances are adopted from @xcite . in general , good agreement with the revised solar abundances @xcite",
    "is found , with some small differences in oxygen ( and neon ) .",
    "these cosmic abundances are recommended as initial values for future stellar evolution calculations of massive stars .",
    "note in particular the reduction of @xmath0 to 0.014 from the so far canonical value of 0.02 .",
    "accurate atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances have been determined for 15 galactic tepid supergiants so far @xcite .",
    "six ba - type supergiants are located within gould s belt ( like all b star targets ) , while the remaining ones are found in the field and in associations out to distances of @xmath23kpc from the sun .",
    "all sample stars within gould s belt show similar abundances of the heavier elements @xcite , corroborating the concept of chemical homogeneity of the ism in the solar neighbourhood at present day .",
    "a slightly larger spread in abundances is found for the more distant stars , implying a total range in abundance of less than a factor of 2 ( and flat galactic abundance gradients , figs .",
    "18 & 19 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is consistent with predictions from simple models of turbulent mixing within the ism ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is much less than the factor of @xmath210 in abundance range found in previous studies .    data relevant for our comparison with stellar evolution models are displayed in fig .",
    "[ histograms ] .",
    "the abundance distributions show depleted carbon and enriched nitrogen relative to the cosmic abundance standard values , as expected for the evolved state of the supergiants .",
    "the upper limit of carbon abundances in the ba - type supergiants is consistent with the pristine value derived from the b stars , meeting a boundary condition imposed by mixing .",
    "note that the abundance ranges covered are much smaller than in published work on similar stars ( as indicated in fig .",

    "[ evol ] ( preliminary results for a few highly massive supergiants in nearby galaxies are also shown ) .",
    "we recall that this comparison is not ideal , as the evolution calculations @xcite were performed for @xmath0@xmath10.02 , while the observations are on average consistent with a value of @xmath0@xmath10.014 . however , the expected effects for this metallicity difference will not change the general conclusions drawn in the following .",
    "most of the apparently slow - rotating b stars show n / c ratios close to the pristine value of @xmath20.3 .",
    "a notable exception is @xmath16sco , which was shown recently to be a truly slow - rotating magnetic star .",
    "the situation is more complex with the ba - type supergiants .",
    "they all exhibit slow rotation because of their expanded envelopes , irrespective of the initial rotational velocity of their progenitors on the main sequence .",
    "it appears that the objects at masses below @xmath215@xmath17 show larger amounts of nuclear - processed material than those around @xmath220@xmath17 .",
    "larger n / c ratios are found again for the most massive objects of the sample .",
    "note that objects of @xmath18@xmath1930@xmath17 are located either in the magellanic clouds or in m31 , i.e. they have a different metallicity than the galactic stars .",
    "note further that in view of the results discussed by levesque et al .",
    "( these proceedings ) stars of such high masses apparently avoid the red supergiant phase .",
    "-statistical & systematic ) from our work and those typical for previous work are also indicated .",
    "stellar evolution tracks @xcite are displayed for rotating stars at @xmath20@xmath10.02 ( full lines ) .",
    "starting with an initial n / c@xmath20.3 , theory predicts n / c@xmath21 for ba - type supergiants evolving to the red , and n / c@xmath223 after the first dredge - up ( markers along the tracks ) . since we find n / c values as high as @xmath196 the observed mixing efficiency is higher than predicted",
    "also , blue loops extend to hotter temperatures than predicted .",
    "results for a few objects in nearby galaxies are also shown . ]",
    "two important conclusions can already be drawn from this small sample .",
    "let us concentrate first on the objects more massive than @xmath215@xmath17 .",
    "a general trend of increased mixing of nuclear - processed material with increasing stellar mass is found , in accordance with the predictions of evolution models .",
    "moreover , the strongest mixing signature is found for the most metal - poor object , azv475 in the small magellanic cloud , also in agreement with theory ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the mixing efficiency appears to be higher ( by a factor of @xmath22 ) than predicted by current state - of - the - art evolution computations for rotating stars with mass - loss .",
    "stellar evolution models accounting for the interplay of rotation and magnetic fields may resolve this discrepancy since they find a higher efficiency for chemical mixing @xcite .",
    "larger n / c ratios at @xmath18@xmath2115@xmath17 can be explained if the objects are on a blue loop , i.e. if they have already undergone the first dredge - up during a previous phase as a red supergiant , in addition to rotational mixing .",
    "this interpretation is in contrast to earlier findings of @xcite .",
    "further support for the blue - loop scenario comes from lifetime considerations .",
    "stellar evolution calculations indicate that supergiants spend a much longer time on a blue - loop ( with core he - burning ) than required for the crossing of the hrd from the blue to the red ( the short phase of core contraction after core h - burning has ceased ) .",
    "e.g. , in the case of a rotating 9@xmath17 model of @xcite the difference is about a factor of 15 .",
    "it is well - established that blue loops are required to explain the cepheid variables , but their extent in the hrd  in particular the upper limits in temperature and stellar mass  are essentially unknown .",
    "the blue - loop phase is highly sensitive to the details of the stellar evolution calculations (   is a sort of magnifying glass , revealing relentlessly the faults of calculations of earlier phases .  ,",
    "consequently , a systematic study of a larger sample of massive stars could provide the tight observational constraints required for a thorough verification and refinement of the stellar evolution models .",
    "precision analyses of stars covering the relevant part of the hrd are under way .",
