    "in this article , we want to present a pedagogical approach to the equations governing the evolution of the universe , namely the friedmann equations . indeed , the derivation of this equations is intrinsically relativistic .",
    "although in newtonian theory , the universe must be static , milne  @xcite and mccrea and milne  @xcite showed that , surprisingly , the friedmann equations can be derived from the simpler newtonian theory . in section  [ ii ] , we recall their derivation (   [ ii1 ] ) for a universe filled with pressureless matter and then discuss the introduction of a cosmological constant (   [ ii2 ] ) .",
    "indeed , it is puzzling that the newtonian theory and general relativity give the same results ; we briefly discuss this issue in   [ ii3 ] .",
    "once we have interpreted the friedmann equations , we study them as a dynamical system .",
    "the first authors to consider such an approach were stabell and refsdal  @xcite who investigated the friedmann  lematre model with a pressureless fluid .",
    "this was then generalised to a fluid with any equation of state  @xcite .",
    "then , this technique was intensively used to study the isotropisation of homogeneous models ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . for a general description of the use of dynamical systems in cosmology , we refer to the book by wainwright and ellis  @xcite where most of the techniques are detailed .",
    "our purpose here , is to present such an analysis for a fluid with any equation of state and including a cosmological constant while staying as pedagogical as possible . in section",
    "  [ iii ] , we rewrite the friedmann equations under a form easier to handle with and we extract the dynamical system to study .",
    "we then determine the fixed points of this system and discuss their stability .",
    "we illustrate this analytic study by a numerical integration of this set of equations (   [ iv ] ) and finish by a discussion about the initial conditions explaining the current observed state of our universe (   [ v ] ) .",
    "we follow the approach by milne  @xcite and mccrea and milne  @xcite and the reader is referred to  @xcite for further details .",
    "we consider a sphere of radius @xmath0 filled with a pressureless fluid ( @xmath1 ) of uniform ( mass ) density @xmath2 free  falling under its own gravitational field in an otherwise empty euclidean space .",
    "we decompose the coordinate @xmath3 of any particle of the fluid as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a constant vector referred to as the _ comoving coordinate _ , @xmath6 is the time coordinate and @xmath7 the scale factor .",
    "we choose @xmath7 to have the dimension of a length and @xmath8 to be dimensionless .",
    "it implies that the sphere undergoes a self similar expansion or contraction and that no particle can cross another one .",
    "indeed the edge of the sphere is also moving as @xmath9 assume that while sitting on a particle labelled @xmath10 we are observing a particle labelled @xmath11 ; we see it drift with the relative velocity @xmath12 where a dot refers to a time derivative , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . as a consequence ,",
    "any particle @xmath10 sees any other particle @xmath11 with a radial velocity proportional to its distance and the expansion is isotropic with respect to any point of the sphere , whatever the function @xmath15 .",
    "but , note that this does not imply that all particles are equivalent ( as will be discussed later ) .    to determine the equation of motion of any particle of this expanding sphere , we first write the equation of matter conservation stating that the mass within any comoving volume is constant ( i.e. @xmath16 ) implying that @xmath17 which can also be written under the form @xmath18 note that eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) can also be deduced from the more general conservation equation @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    to determine the equation of evolution of the scale factor @xmath7 , we first compute the gravitational potential energy @xmath23 of a particle of masse @xmath24 by applying the gauss law @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the newton constant and @xmath27 the mass within the sphere of radius @xmath28 given by @xmath29 we then need to evaluate its kinetic energy @xmath30 which takes the simple form @xmath31 the conservation of the total energy @xmath32 implies , after the use of the decomposition ( [ 1 ] ) and a simplification by @xmath8 , that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a dimensionless constant ( which can depend on @xmath8 ) given by @xmath35 with @xmath8 is imposed by the requirement that the expansion is self  similar ( eq .  [ 1 ] ) and that no shell of labeled @xmath8 can cross a shell of label @xmath36 . ] .      in the former derivation ,",
    "the gravitational potential on any particle inside the sphere is proportional to the distance @xmath37 .",
    "any other force deriving from a potential proportional to @xmath37 will mimic a gravitational effect .",
    "a force deriving from the potential energy @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a constant was introduced by einstein in 1917 . as in the previous section , writing that the total energy @xmath41 is constant leads to the equation of motion @xmath42 from ( [ 10 ] ) , we deduce that @xmath40 has the dimension of an inverse squared length . the total force on a particle",
    "is @xmath43 from which it can be concluded that ( i ) it opposes gravity if @xmath40 is positive and that ( ii ) it can be tuned so that @xmath44 leading to @xmath45 and @xmath46constant if @xmath47 this enables to recover a static autogravitating sphere hence leading to a model for a static universe .",
    "the force deriving from @xmath38 is analogous to the one exerted by a spring of negative constant .",
    "to finish , we recall on table  [ tableunit ] the dimension of all the quantities used in the former sections , mainly to compare with standard textbooks in which the choice @xmath48 is usually made .",

    "these are two differential equations for the two variables @xmath15 and @xmath61 which can be solved once the two parameters @xmath34 and @xmath40 have been chosen .    in the context of general relativity",
    ", one can deduce the law of evolution for the scale factor of the universe @xmath7 which is given by the friedmann equations @xmath62 with @xmath63 and the conservation equation @xmath64 eq .",
    "( [ fried1 ] ) reduces to ( [ 11 ] ) and , eq .",
    "( [ eq_cons ] ) to ( [ 5 ] ) when @xmath1 .",
    "the equation ( [ fried2 ] ) is redundant and can be deduced from the two others .",
    "note that now eq .  ( [ eq_cons ] ) is also a conservation equation but with the mass flux @xmath65 .",
    "this can be interpreted by remembering that the first law of thermodynamics for an adiabatic system  @xcite takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the energy contained in the physical volume @xmath68 ( scaling as @xmath69 ) .",
    "the first thing to stress is that equations ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) do not depend on the radius @xmath70 of the sphere .",
    "it thus seems that we can let it go to infinity without changing the conclusions and hence explaining why we recover the friedmann equations .",
    "this was the viewpoint adopted by milne  @xcite and mccrea and milne  @xcite .",
    "this approach leads to some problems .",
    "first , it has to be checked that the gauss theorem still applies after taking the limit toward infinity ( i.e. one has to check that the integrals and the limit commute ) .",
    "this imposes that @xmath2 decreases fast enough with @xmath8 and thus that there is indeed a center .",
    "equivalently , as pointed out by layzer  @xcite , the force on any particle of an infinite homogeneous distribution is undetermined ( the integral over the angles is zero while the integral over the radial coordinate is infinite ) .",
    "the convergence of the force requires either the mass distribution to be finite ( in which case it can be homogeneous ) or to be inhomogeneous if it is infinite .",
    "the issue of the finiteness of the universe has been widely discussed and a clear presentation of the evolution of ideas in that respect are presented in  @xcite .",
    "second , for distances of cosmological interests , i.e. of some hundred of megaparsec , the recession speed of the particles of the sphere are of order of some fraction of the speed of light .",
    "one will thus require a ( special ) relativistic treatment of the expanding sphere .",
    "third , the gravitational potential grows with the square of the radius of the sphere but it can not become too large otherwise , due to the virial theorem , the velocities would exceed the speed of light .",
    "it was then proposed  @xcite that such an expanding sphere may describe a region the size of which is small compared with the size of the observable universe ( i.e. of the hubble size ) .",
    "since all regions of a uniform and isotropic universe expand the same way , the study of a small region gives information about the whole universe ( but this does not solve the problem of the computation of the gravitational force ) .",
    "the center seems to be a privileged points since it is the only point to be at rest with respect to the absolute frame .",
    "but , one can show that the spacetime background of newtonian mechanics is invariant under a larger group than the traditionally described galilean group . as shown by milne",
    "@xcite , mccrea and milne  @xcite and bonnor  @xcite ( see also carter and gaffet  @xcite for a modern description ) it includes the set of all time - dependent space translations @xmath71 where @xmath72 are arbitrarily differentiable functions depending only on the time coordinate @xmath6 .",
    "this group of transformation is intermediate between the galilean group and the group of all diffeomorphisms under which the einstein theory in invariant .",
    "thanks to this invariance group , each point can be chosen as a center around which there is local isotropy and homogeneity but the isotropy is broken by the existence of the boundary of the sphere ( i.e. all observer can believe living at the center as long as he / she does not observe the boundary of the expanding sphere ) .",
    "there are also conceptual differences between the newtonian cosmology and the relativist cosmology . in the former",
    "we have a sphere of particle moving in a static and absolute euclidean space and the time of evolution of the sphere is disconnected from the absolute time @xmath6 .",
    "for instance in a recollapsing sphere , the time will go on flowing even after the crunch of the sphere .",
    "in general relativity , space is expanding and the particles are comoving .",
    "we thus identify an expanding sphere in a fixed background and an expanding spacetime with fixed particles . as long as we are dealing with a pressureless fluid ,",
    "this is possible since there is no pressure gradient and each point of the sphere can be identify with one point of space ( in fact , with an absolute time we are working in a synchronous reference frame and we want it to be also comoving , which is possible only if @xmath1  @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the pressure term in the friedmann equations can not trivially be recovered from the newtonian argument . as shown , one gets the correct friedmann equations if one starts from the conservation law including pressure ( and derived from the first law of thermodynamics ) and the conservation of energy .",
    "but if one were starting from the newton law relating force ( [ 12 ] ) and acceleration ( @xmath73 ) , the term containing the pressure in ( [ fried2 ] ) would not have been recovered ; one should have added an extra pressure contribution @xmath74 which can not be guessed .",
    "this is a consequence that in general relativity any type of energy has a gravitational effect . in a way it is a `` miracle '' that the equation ( [ fried1 ] ) does not depend on @xmath50 , which makes it possible to derive from the newtonian conservation of energy .",
    "beside it has also to be stressed that the newtonian derivation of the friedmann equations by milne came after friedmann and lematre demonstrated the validity of the friedmann equations for an unbounded homogeneous distribution of matter ( using general relativity ) .",
    "it has to be pointed out that these newtonian models can not explain all the observational relations since , contrary to general relativity , they do not incorporate a theory of light propagation . as outlined by lazer  @xcite one can sometime legitimately treat a part of the ( dust ) expanding universe as an isolated system in which case the newtonian treatment is correct , which makes mccrea  @xcite conclude that this is an _ indication _ that einstein s law of gravity must admit the same _ interpretation _ as that of newton s in the case of a spherically symmetric mass distribution .",
    "note that the structural similarity of einstein and newton gravity were put forward by cartan  @xcite who showed that these two theories are much closer that one naively thought and , in that framework ( which goes far beyond our purpose ) one can work out a correct derivation of the friedmann equations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most important outcome of the newtonian derivation of the friedmann equations is that it allows to interpret equation ( [ fried1 ] ) in terms of the conservation of energy ; the term in @xmath75 represents the kinetic energy , the term in @xmath76 the gravitational potential energy , the term in @xmath77 the energy associated with the cosmological constant and the term in @xmath34 the total energy of the system .",
    "the properties of the spatial sections ( i.e. of the three dimensional spaces of constant time ) are related to the sign of @xmath34 and can be compared with the property of the trajectories of the point of the sphere which are related to the sign of the total energy @xmath51 ; we sum up all these properties on table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "lccc @xmath51 & @xmath78 & @xmath79 & @xmath80 + trajectory & hyperbolic & parabolic & elliptic + & unbounded & unbounded & bounded + @xmath34 & @xmath80 & @xmath79 & @xmath78 + spatial section & infinite & infinite & finite +",
    "the friedmann equations ( [ fried1][fried2 ] ) and the conservation equation ( [ eq_cons ] ) form a set of two independent equations for three variables ( @xmath7 , @xmath50 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the usual approach is to solve this system by specifying the matter content of the universe mainly by assuming an equation of state of the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 may depend on @xmath2 and thus on time . for a pressureless fluid ( modelling for instance a fluid of galaxies ) @xmath83 and for a fluid of radiation ( such as photon , neutrino , ... ) @xmath84 .",
    "we assume that @xmath85 since such a type of matter is described by the cosmological constant and singled out from  ordinary \" matter and that @xmath86 since such a type of matter mimics the curvature term and is thus incorporated with it .",
    "one can then first integrate ( [ eq_cons ] ) rewritten as @xmath87 to get the function @xmath88 which , in the case where @xmath82 is constant , yields @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a positive constant of integration , and then insert the solution for @xmath88 in eq .",
    "( [ fried1 ] ) to get a closed equation for the scale factor @xmath7 ( see e.g.  @xcite for such an approach and @xcite for an alternative and pedagogical derivation ) .    in this section ,",
    "we want to present another approach in which the friedmann equations are considered as a dynamical system and to determine its phase space .",
    "the first step is to rewrite the set of dynamical equations with the three new variables @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 defined as @xmath94 they respectively represent the relative amount of energy density present in the matter distribution , cosmological constant and curvature .",
    "@xmath91 has to be positive and there is no constraint on the sign of both @xmath92 and @xmath93 . with these definitions , it is straightforward to deduce from ( [ fried1 ] ) that @xmath95 using that @xmath96 , expressing @xmath97 from eq .",

    "the derivative of any quantity @xmath103 with respect to @xmath104 , @xmath105 , is then related to its derivative with respect to @xmath6 by @xmath106 .",

    "since it is a black body with temperature @xmath193k , we deduce , from the stephan - boltzmann law , that @xmath194 where @xmath195 is a factor to take into account the contribution of three families of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "the radiation was thus dominating over the matter for scale factors smaller than @xmath196 at which @xmath197 and thus given by @xmath198 we can integrate back until the planck era for which @xmath199 and can thus approximate @xmath82 by @xmath200 which is a good approximation for @xmath201 . in figure  [ fig5 ] , we depict the domain @xmath202 of current observational values and its inverse image by the system ( [ syst1 ] ) at the beginning of the matter era and at the end planck era .    to illustrate this fine tuning problem analytically , let us just consider the simplest case where @xmath130 for which the evolution of @xmath91 is simply given by @xmath203 the solution of which is @xmath204 and thus , @xmath205 from the observational data we get that @xmath206 and thus @xmath207 from which we deduce that @xmath208 this illustrate that a almost flat universe requires a fine tuning of the curvature , which is a consequence that @xmath128 is a repulsor in both the radiation and the matter era .",
    "a solution to solve this fine tuning problem would be to add a phase prior to the radiation era in which @xmath209 so that @xmath128 becomes an attractor and to tune the duration of this era such as to have the correct initial conditions .",
    "then , during the standard evolution eds becomes repulsor and we evolve toward ds staying close to the line @xmath210 hence explaining current observations .",
    "inflation is a realisation of such a scenario .",
    "what inflation really does is to change the stability property of the fixed points and invariant boundaries of the system ( [ syst1 ] ) .",
    "hence during this period where a fluid with negative pressure is dominating we are attracted close to the line @xmath210 and the closer the longer this phase lasts .",
    "we then switch to a phase with normal matter and start to drift away due to repulsive property of eds .",
    "nevertheless , inflation does more than just explaining where we stand in this phase space , it also gives an explanation for the observed structures ( galaxies , clusters ... ) of our universe , but this is beyond the scope of this article .",
