    "a social network is a graph of relationships between individuals , groups , or organizations . as an effective tool in connecting people and spreading information ,",
    "social networks have caught the attention of millions of small businesses as well as major companies . to exploit social networks to gain influence ,",
    "it is essential to understand the behaviors of information propagation in social networks .",
    "however , given the large - scale of existing social networks , it is challenging to design a tractable and efficient model to describe the information propagation process in social networks .",
    "for instance , let us consider a scenario that an event ( such as a rumor ) initially happened on a node ( denoted as the seed node ) , this event may happen again on some neighboring nodes and may further happen on some far - away nodes due to the information propagation through the network .",
    "then , the question is how does the information propagate ? also , after sufficient propagation , what probability will this event happen on a random node ?",
    "( this probability could be viewed as the * influence * strength from the seed node to this random node . )    indeed , there are several existing models to describe the above information propagation process , such as the linear threshold(lt ) model @xcite the independent cascade(ic ) model  @xcite .",
    "however , these models are operational models , they are untractable and inefficient . under these models , if we want to get the probability of one event happened on a node , we need to run monte - carlo simulations of these influence models for sufficiently many times ( e.g. 20000 times ) to obtain an accurate estimate of the probability for the event happen  @xcite , and this approach is very time - consuming .",
    "moreover , if the event initially happened on more than one node ( seed ) , the probability of this event happened on a random node will be a combination of influences from all of these seeds . in this case , how to get the probability for the event happen and how to identify the independent probability ( or independent influence ) of each seed",
    "are challenging research issues .    to this end , in this paper , we propose a social influence model based on electrical circuit theory to simulate the information propagation process in social networks . with this model",
    ", we are able to obtain a probabilistic influence matrix to describe the influence strength between any pair of nodes . also , based on this model",
    ", we provide a novel method to identify the independent influence of each seed node when there are more than one seed .",
    "this can lead to a natural solution to the social influence maximization problem  @xcite , which targets on finding a small subset of influential nodes in a social network to influence as many nodes as possible .",
    "specifically , the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "* we propose the idea of exploiting the circuit network to simulate the information ( or influence ) propagation process in social networks .",
    "this simulation is straightforward and is easy to interpret and understand . to the best of our knowledge , this is the first work that exploits circuit theory for estimating the spread of social influence .",
    "what s more , this model is tractable even for more than one seed node . with this model",
    ", we could provide a novel way to compute the independent influence of a seed naturally .",
    "* we identify an upper bound of the node s influence on the network .",
    "this upper bound property can help us to select the truly influential nodes and drastically reduce the search space . by exploiting these computational properties ,",
    "we develop an efficient approximation method to compute the influences and successfully apply this circuit theory based model to solve the social influence maximization problem . along this line , we first prove that the influence spread function is also submodular under the circuit model .",
    "then , by the greedy strategy , we design an algorithm to select @xmath0 influential nodes to maximize their influence . finally , experimental results show that the circuit theory based methods have the advantages over the state - of - the - art algorithms for the social influence maximization problem in terms of both efficiency as well as the effectiveness .",
    "[ sec : model ] in this section , we propose a social influence model based on electrical circuit theory .",
    "social influence refers to the behavioral change of individuals affected by others in a network .",
    "social influence is an intuitive and well - accepted phenomenon in social networks  @xcite . in this section",
    ", we will propose a quantitative definition of social influence to measure its amount .",
    "let @xmath1 is an information network   to node @xmath2 on arc @xmath3 in twitter .",
    "] , where the node set @xmath4 includes all of individuals , the arc set @xmath5 represents all the social connections .",
    "let @xmath6 denote the influence from node @xmath2 to node @xmath7 , we propose three rules to define the influence between any pair of nodes .",
    "* the influence from oneself should be 1 , that is @xmath8 .",
    "* the influence could transmit through the network arcs with certain probability . *",
    "the influence on one node should be related to the influences on the node s neighbors , suppose node @xmath7 s neighbor set is @xmath9  ( i.e. @xmath10 ) ,",
    "then @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the transmission probability on arc @xmath13 .    to the construction modeled by the above three rules , there are two factors could change its shape .",
    "the first one is the transmission probabilities on arcs . in this paper",
    ", we propose an assumption to confine the probability , that is    [ as : theta ] the sum of transmission probabilities flowing into one node should be less than or equal to 1 .",
    "that is , @xmath14 or @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17_{n*n}$ ] is a transmission matrix in which @xmath18 is the transmission probability from node @xmath2 to node @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath19 , then @xmath20 .    actually , this assumption is used for measuring the amount of information  ( e.g. , with regard to an event or message ) that will be accepted by each node .",
    "the corresponding value varies in the range of [ 0,1 ] , where @xmath21 stands for the ignorance of the message and @xmath22 means this node totally believes in it .",
    "notably , in the last section of this paper , we also discuss the way how to break through the confinement of this assumption .",
    "the second one is the way how the influence on one node is related to the influences on its neighbors . in the previous works ,",
    "aggarawal et al  @xcite proposed a way to describe the relation among the neighbors influence , that is @xmath23 which claims that the transmitted influence from different neighbors should be independent to each other . this way is a theoretically reasonable way but it is too complex to get its closed - form solution .",
    "so , in this paper , we propose a linear method to define it .",
    "that is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 locates in the range @xmath26 which is a damping coefficient of node @xmath7 for the influence propagation .",
    "the smaller the @xmath27 is ( i.e. , approaching to 0 ) , the less the information will be blocked by node i. this number varies with respect to the topic that the propagating information belongs to . if node @xmath2 favors the topic of the propagating information , @xmath27 should approach to 0 , otherwise , it should approach to @xmath28 .",
    "thus , this way could be topic sensitive when the damping coefficients on each node are decided according to their favorite .      to the linear way proposed in equation  [ eq : linear ] , there is a physical implication when the information network @xmath29 is undirected .",
    "we find that when we construct a circuit network @xmath30 by the following way , the current flow in the circuit is running in the same way with the information propagation described by equation  [ eq : linear ] and the potential value on each node is an equivalent value to the influence on it .",
    "for an undirected network @xmath29 in figure  [ fig - network ] ( a ) , we construct its corresponding circuit network @xmath30 in figure  [ fig - network ] ( b ) as follows .",
    "* first , construct a topologically isomorphic circuit network of @xmath29 , where the conductance between node @xmath2 and @xmath7 is equal to @xmath31 and guarantees that @xmath32 where @xmath33 ; * second , connect each node @xmath2 with an external electrode @xmath34 through an additional electric conductor with conductance @xmath35 .",
    "the electric potential value on @xmath34 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a real number which will be decided later .    in @xmath30 ,",
    "kirchhoff equations  @xcite tell us that the total current flowing into any node @xmath7 should sum up to zero , thus in the circuit network @xmath38 : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total current flowing into node @xmath7 and @xmath41 is the electric potential value on node @xmath7 . from equation  [ kiff1 ] , we have @xmath42 in this equation , if we decide @xmath43 by the following way @xmath44 then comparing with equation  [ eq : linear ] , it is easy to get @xmath45 which means that the potential value on node @xmath7 is an equivalent value to the influence @xmath6 .",
    "notably , when @xmath46 , @xmath47 , then the potential value on @xmath48 will be equal to 0 also , all of these node could be viewed as ground nodes , thus this circuit network can work well .      in light of the circuit network",
    ", we amend our linear model as follows @xmath49 where @xmath43 is a correction to guarantee that , when @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "thus , the value of @xmath43 could be determined as @xmath52 equation  [ eq : linearcor ] could be rewritten as @xmath53 where @xmath54'\\nonumber\\\\    t&=&[t_{ij}]_{n*n}\\nonumber\\\\    \\nuup&=&[0 , 0 , ... \\nu_i\\neq 0, ... 0]^{t}\\nonumber\\\\    \\lambda&=&diag(\\lambda_1 , \\lambda_2 , ... \\lambda_n)\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which could be solved as @xmath55 where the transpose of @xmath56 is strictly diagonally dominant , thus it is invertible , and we denote @xmath56 as @xmath57_{n*n}$ ] and denote its inverse as @xmath58_{n*n}$ ] .",
    "for @xmath59 is a vector with only one nonzero entry @xmath37 , thus @xmath60 and based on rule 1 , @xmath61 should be equal to 1 , there is @xmath62 thus , @xmath63 similarly , we could get @xmath64 this equation could be rewritten as @xmath65'\\nonumber\\\\     & = & [ \\frac{1}{p_{11}}p_{\\cdot 1},\\frac{1}{p_{22}}p_{\\cdot 2}, ...",
    "\\frac{1}{p_{nn}}p_{\\cdot n}]'\\nonumber\\\\     & = & diag(p)^{-1}p'\\nonumber\\\\     & = & [ f_{ij}]_{n*n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] because the entries of matrix @xmath66 describe the influences between any pairs of nodes  ( in @xmath66 , @xmath67 ) , in this paper we call @xmath66 as * influence matrix * and call @xmath68 as node @xmath2 s * influence vector*.      because @xmath69 , the computation of @xmath66 is actually to get @xmath70 . because @xmath56 is a strictly diagonally dominant matrix which satisfies the convergence condition of gauss - seidel method , its inverse @xmath71 could be computed by a very fast way through a gauss - seidel iteration process .",
    "because @xmath72 where @xmath73 could be viewed as the variables of this linear system of equations . for @xmath56 is strictly diagonally dominant , @xmath73 could be solved by gauss - seidel method .",
    "specifically , gauss - seidel method is an iterative method which is operated as the following procedures :    1 .",
    "set @xmath74 for @xmath75 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath76 , for @xmath77 ; 3 .",
    "continue step 2 until the changes made by an iteration are below a given tolerance .",
    "this procedures is efficient . to get @xmath73 within a valid tolerance range",
    ", it often need only dozens of iterations .",
    "thus , the time complexity of computing @xmath73 is @xmath78 and the time complexity of @xmath66 is @xmath79 . moreover , because the computation of @xmath71 could be partitioned to @xmath80 parts , we could compute @xmath71 in @xmath80 parts in parallel .    even though , the computation of @xmath66 is still too consuming to be applied to a large scale network . for real networks ,",
    "it is not necessary to compute the influence vectors of each nodes since many of them is nobody in the network . in the following section",
    ", we will propose a fast method to estimate which nodes are important to the network .",
    "suppose the influence vector of node @xmath2 is @xmath81'$ ] , then its total influence on the network should be @xmath82 and we denote this number as @xmath83 and this number could be viewed as the importance of node @xmath2 in the network .",
    "on the other hand , we denote @xmath84 .",
    "then , we could get the following property    [ pr : potentialbound ] @xmath85    for @xmath86 for @xmath87 , the dot product of @xmath2-th row of @xmath71 and @xmath2-th column of @xmath56 should be 1 , that is @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 for any @xmath91 . then , this equation is equivalent to @xmath92 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath93 . and then , @xmath94 with equation  [ eq : potential_i ] , there is @xmath95    in equation  [ eq : potentialbound ] , the quantity @xmath96 is a value that could be got by fast method .",

    "thus , thanks to property  [ pr : potentialbound ] , we could get the upper bound of nodes importance in @xmath78 time .",
    "these upper bounds could help us to quickly identify those less - importance nodes and skip them .",
    "what s more , @xmath102 is a very compact upper bound to estimate the importance of node @xmath2 and we will demonstrates it in section  [ sec : exp ] .",
    "in real applications , we may need to compute the influence from a node set @xmath103 to the nodes of the network  ( consistent with the notation @xmath6 , we denote the influence from set @xmath103 to node @xmath7 as @xmath104 ) . in  @xcite ,",
    "goyal et al assumed that the influences of different nodes are independent of each other .",
    "hence , the joint influence @xmath104 can be defined as @xmath105 however , the influences from different nodes are obviously not mutually independent .",
    "then , how can we get the independent influence of a node when it belongs to a node set @xmath103 ?      to simplify the discussion , we will first turn to solve an equivalent problem defined as follows .",

    "then , for the event source set @xmath110 , we could work out the independent influence for any element in @xmath111 , and @xmath112 because @xmath113 , for ease of writing and consistent with the previous notation , in the following text , we will use @xmath114 to denote @xmath6 , use @xmath115 to denote @xmath116 and use @xmath117 to denote @xmath118 . by equation  [ eq : seedsetif ] ,",
    "the happening probability @xmath115 can be computed .",
    "thus , problem [ pr : indinf ] is the basis for computing the influence from a node set . in order to get the independent influence @xmath119 ,",
    "let us think about the essence of independent influence in light of the circuit perspective .",
    "we could summarize the independent influence into two conditions :    1 .",
    "each node in @xmath103 will never be influenced by node @xmath120 ; 2 .",
    "each node in @xmath103 will never propagate the influence derived from node @xmath120 .    because the nodes in @xmath103 are the ones on which event @xmath121 has already happened",
    ", they do not need to be influenced by @xmath120 and can not be influenced .",
    "therefore , the above condition 1 needs to be satisfied . on the other hand , because each node in @xmath103 itself will spread the influence on the network about event @xmath121 , it will block the same type of influence from @xmath120 .",
    "therefore , we assume nodes in @xmath103 will never propagate the influence from @xmath120 .",
    "based on the above two conditions , we could construct a circuit network @xmath122 to model the independent influence from node @xmath120 to the other nodes as follows :    1 .",
    "first , construct the circuit network @xmath30 ; 2 .",
    "put an electric pole with voltage value 0 on each node in @xmath103 ; 3 .",

    ", we can see that the above two conditions about independent influence are satisfied naturally .          in the previous subsection ,",
    "we have constructed the circuit network for simulating the independent influence . in this subsection",
    ", we first analyze the potential value on each node which could be viewed as the influence on it .",

    "based on equation  [ eq : nus ] , we know that the number of @xmath146 should guarantee that @xmath148 . by equation  [ eq : indu ] , that is @xmath149 .",
    "then , @xmath150 and we could get @xmath151 based on the previous discussion , the potential on node @xmath7 could be viewed as the independent influence from node @xmath120 to node @xmath152 .",

    "because @xmath139 is a strictly diagonally dominant matrix , it satisfies the convergence condition of gauss - seidel method .",
    "and from @xmath162 , there is @xmath163 . taking the similar procedures in section  [ subsec : computation ]",
    ", we could compute the @xmath120-th column of @xmath164 in @xmath78 time .",
    "in this section , we show how to exploit the circuit model for handling the social influence maximization problem , which targets on finding a set of seeds in a way that these seeds will influence the maximal number of individuals in the network .",
    "the social influence maximization problem can be formalized as @xmath165 where @xmath104 follows the meaning in equation  [ eq : seedsetif ] which is the influence from @xmath103 to node @xmath7 . and in the following text , we denote @xmath166 as @xmath167 which is the influence spread function of @xmath103(i.e .",

    "no matter what value @xmath197 is , the difference of effectiveness is less than 0.04 , and for most of @xmath197 values , the effectiveness of circuit is larger than 0.97  ( against celf ) and better than the best one among pmia , pagerank , degreediscountic and degree .",
    "* when the @xmath197 value increases from 0 to 1 , the effectiveness of circuit ascends at the beginning and then descends starting from a certain point .",
    "this observation could be explained by our assumption in section  [ sec : circuit] there exists a certain damping coefficient in the real - world information propagation process .",
    "the father the manually set number is from the real damping value , the worse our model describes the real information propagation , and vice verse . experimentally , the real @xmath197 located in the range @xmath199 $ ] .",

    "when the @xmath201 , the running times of circuit are 22.2s , 56.1s respectively , which are comparable with pmia s ( 10.8s , 56.3s respectively ) , while the influence spread results of circuit with @xmath202 are all better than pmia s . from the above observations , we can know that if we want to get a better effectiveness , we should set @xmath197 to be a number in @xmath199 $ ] and if we want to get the result efficiently , we should set @xmath197 to be a comparable large value .      to demonstrate the effectiveness of the upper bound proposed in property  [ pr : potentialbound ] , we take a test in the following two networks : wiki - vote , ca - hepph .",
    "we first select top-100 nodes with the highest indegree from each network , then compute their importance ( @xmath203 ) and their corresponding upper bound @xmath204(with parameter @xmath205 ) .",

    "[ fig : bound ] we can observe that , for each network , the blue line is always very close to the red line which demonstrates that @xmath204 is a very compact upper bound of importance @xmath102 .",

    "@xcite proved the existence of social influence by statistical tests . also , goyal et al .",
    "@xcite studied how to learn the true probabilities of social influence between individuals .",
    "in addition , there are several models to infer how the influence propagates through the network .",

    "* social influence maximization . * domingoes and richardson proposed to exploit social influence for the marketing application , which is called viral marketing  @xcite , or social influence maximization .",
    "the goal is to find a set of seeds which will influence the maximal number of individuals in the network .",
