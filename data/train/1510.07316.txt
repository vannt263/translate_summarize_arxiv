    "have shown that the measurement of the classical electromagnetic field can not be performed instantaneously and involves instead an averaging procedure over past spacetime events  @xcite . to go beyond the locality postulate and incorporate history dependence for fields ,",
    "the past history of the accelerated observer and the fields must be taken into account . on this basis",
    ", a nonlocal special relativity theory has been developed in which the fields are local but satisfy integro - differential equations  @xcite .",
    "the deep connection between inertia and gravitation suggests that the latter should be history dependent as well .",
    "to implement this idea , a classical nonlocal generalization of einstein s theory of gravitation has recently been developed .",
    "this nonlocal gravity theory is an extension of general relativity in which the past history of the gravitational field is taken into account via a certain spacetime average involving a kernel that , at this stage of the development of the theory , must be determined from observation .",
    "nonlocal gravity is thus memory dependent .",
    "memory dies out in space and time , features that must be reflected in the choice of the kernel of the theory .",
    "the gravitational field is local , but satisfies the integro - differential equations of nonlocal gravity theory  @xcite .",
    "a significant feature of nonlocal gravity is that the nonlocal aspect of gravity appears to simulate dark matter .",
    "that is , in this theory there is no dark matter ; hence , what appears as dark matter in astrophysics and cosmology is expected to be due to the nonlocal character of gravity .",
    "the persistent negative result of experiments that have searched for the particles of dark matter naturally leads to the possibility that what appears as dark matter in astronomy is in fact an aspect of the gravitational interaction . along this line of thought",
    ", many theories have been proposed . among such theories , nonlocal theories of gravitation form a prominent subclass .",
    "the inspiration for nonlocal gravitation theories often has its origin in developments in quantum field theory ",
    "see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite and the references cited therein . a proper consideration of such theories is well beyond the scope of the present paper , which is primarily based on a classical nonlocal generalization of einstein s general relativity that has originated from a critical analysis of the fundamental assumption of locality that underlies the standard theory of relativity .",
    "the nonlocal character of gravity that is considered in this work can not yet replace dark matter on all physical scales .",
    "dark matter is currently required in astrophysics for explaining the gravitational dynamics of galaxies as well as clusters of galaxies  @xcite , gravitational lensing observations  @xcite and structure formation in cosmology .",
    "we emphasize that only some of the implications of nonlocal gravity theory have thus far been confronted with observation  @xcite .",
    "nonlocal gravity is in the early stages of development at present and besides the minkowski spacetime , no exact solution of the theory is known .",
    "the absence of any exact nontrivial solution of the theory implies that the nonlinear regime of the theory , including exact cosmological models as well as considerations involving dark energy , are beyond the scope of this work  @xcite .",
    "however , the general linear approximation of nonlocal gravity beyond minkowski spacetime has been investigated in detail  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the implications of the theory in the newtonian regime have been shown to be consistent with gravitational dynamics in spiral galaxies , clusters of galaxies and the solar system  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the standard models of cosmology , dark matter is absolutely necessary for cosmological structure formation .",
    "it is therefore of basic importance to investigate whether the nonlocal character of gravity can effectively replace dark matter in cosmological structure formation .",
    "to make a beginning in this direction is the main motivation for our work .",
    "the remarkable isotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation indicates a small amplitude ( @xmath0 ) for the inhomogeneities that must have existed at the epoch of decoupling ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the tremendous growth of such inhomogeneities from the recombination era to the present time is due to the intrinsic gravitational instability of a nearly homogeneous distribution of matter .",
    "the exact manner in which galaxies , clusters of galaxies and eventually the cosmic web have come about is not known ; however , it is generally believed that _ dark matter _ has played a crucial role in this development  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , under the assumptions of spatial homogeneity and isotropy , newtonian cosmology is an excellent approximation to the standard flrw cosmological models of general relativity so long as the net pressure , as a source of gravity , can be neglected in comparison with the energy density of the matter content of the universe .",
    "more generally , it turns out that after recombination , newtonian gravitation can be applied in the study of nonrelativistic motion of matter on subhorizon scales  @xcite .    in this paper , following the familiar approach of newtonian cosmology",
    ", we consider the dynamics of a large gas cloud in accordance with the newtonian regime of nonlocal gravity .",
    "can nonlocal gravity solve the problem of structure formation in cosmology ?",

    ".   implies that @xmath11 provided @xmath12  @xcite .",

    "detailed observations of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies indicate that @xmath19 is nearly constant for the stars and gas clouds under consideration  @xcite .",
    "newton s second law of motion then implies that in the region under consideration here the force of gravity must decrease with distance as @xmath23 . this significant deviation from the inverse square force law",

    ". then the solution of eq .   can be written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is expected to be a universal galactic length of order 1kpc @xmath34 cm .",

    "newtonian cosmology provides a good approximation to the homogeneous and isotropic flrw models of relativistic cosmology .",

    "indeed , it is natural to assume that relative to baryonic matter , the effective dark matter was more plentiful in the past , since nonlocality is connected with the memory of the past state of the gravitational field and memory fades with time .",
    "it is important to compare this aspect of our toy model with the currently accepted model of standard cosmology , where @xmath90 for the universe is about 5 and independent of cosmic time .",

    "thus , with obvious discretization of its local part , the third equation of the infinite - dimensional system is approximated by @xmath505 odes .",
    "initial data for the infinite - dimensional system is discretized in the same manner as the state variables over the grid points @xmath510 , @xmath523 .",
    "while the resulting initial value problem for the @xmath558-dimensional system of odes may be passed to a general - purpose ode solver to approximate its solution , sufficiently fine spatial resolution and the computational expense incurred by the double integration required at each function evaluation suggests employment of an efficient time stepping routine with few function evaluations per step .",
    "a natural choice is the midpoint method ( also called the leapfrog method ) .",
    "this method was implemented with restart ( after each 20 time steps ) to mitigate its well - known numerical instability .",
    "in addition , each block of 20 steps was recomputed with half the original step size followed by one richardson extrapolation . due to the difference in the computation using simpson s @xmath508 rule and simpson s @xmath509 rule for odd and even numbers of grid points associated with the discretized variable @xmath423 for the numerical approximation of the integral in the first component of the infinite - dimensional vector field , the discretized functions @xmath326 , @xmath476 and @xmath477 incur small numerical oscillations .",
    "these were mollified by filtering with two - point averaging before starting the next block of 20 steps .",
    "the time stepping used here , which requires only two function evaluations per step , is fourth - order accurate in the increment @xmath559 .",
    "simpson s rules for numerical integration are both fourth - order accurate .",
    "thus the entire scheme is fourth - order accurate in the space and time increments except for the trapezoidal rule numerical integrations when function values at only two grid points are available .",
    "the numerical algorithm was implemented in fortran ; its output was post - processed using mathematica to produce graphics .    convergence of the numerical scheme depends on several variables : the numbers of spatial discretization intervals @xmath151 , @xmath433 and @xmath547 , the size of the time step @xmath559 , the singularity mollification parameter @xmath536 and the finite - interval restriction parameters @xmath560 and @xmath561 .",
    "all of these parameters were changed to check for convergence in the numerical experiments .",
    "the numerical integrations reported here involve the approximate solutions of @xmath521 first - order coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations , where @xmath433 is the primary spatial discretization parameter .",
    "for instance , when @xmath562 , we have a system of 18003 first - order equations that are being solved numerically .    in the first set of numerical integrations reported here",
    ", we wish to verify numerically that the solutions of the full nonlocal and nonlinear model with @xmath563 indeed approach that of the linear homogeneous @xmath486 model as the width of the initial gaussian perturbation increases . to this end",

    "the results are given in figure 4 , where the spatial maximum of @xmath476 is plotted versus @xmath568 .",
    "the root - mean - square deviation from the spatial mean ( @xmath516 ) of the initial gaussian perturbation is the _ effective width _ of the perturbation and is given by @xmath569 .",

    "a more ambitious numerical project would involve tackling the question of whether deviations from homogeneity of amplitude @xmath570 at the initial recombination epoch with @xmath571 could grow fast enough such that the maximum of the density contrast function @xmath476 would approach unity before the present epoch thus leading to possible structure formation in cosmology .",
    "we approach this issue in figure 5 , where the numerical results are presented in much the same way as in figure 4 .",

    "a more complete treatment of this problem is beyond the scope of our numerical work due to the limitations of our computational resources .",
    "the numerical results presented in figure 5 do indicate , however , that as the effective width of the initial gaussian perturbation increases , the density contrast may grow fast enough such that the nonlinear perturbation could separate from the homogeneous background and collapse under its own gravity eventually to produce large scale structure in the universe .",
    "the persistent negative results of the experiments that have searched for the particles of dark matter  @xcite naturally lead to the notion that dark matter may not exist .",

    "no exact cosmological solution of nonlocal gravity theory is known ; hence , we extend the weak - field newtonian regime of nonlocal gravity to the cosmological domain by assuming that the ratio of the effective dark matter to matter decreases as the universe expands . this supposition is consistent with the notion that nonlocality is due to the gravitational memory of past events and memory fades over time . within the context of such a nonlocal newtonian cosmology",
