    "graphene , as a novel gapless two dimensional ( 2d ) chiral electron - hole system , has attracted great interest in recent years , both experimentally and theoretically@xcite .",

    "the fundamental interest arises from its unique linear chiral dirac carrier dispersion with a zero energy gap between conduction and valence band@xcite .",
    "the bilayer graphene ( blg ) is also intriguing as its physical properties lie between mlg and 2d semiconductor - based electron gas ( 2deg ) systems which are gapped and non - chiral with a quadratic band dispersion .",
    "much of the early work on graphene transport focused on the density - dependent ( i.e. , gate voltage tuned)@xcite and temperature - dependent @xcite conductivity in homogeneous mlg and blg systems .",
    "the basic graphene transport properties , particularly at high densities far from the charge neutral dirac point , are now reasonably well - understood@xcite .",
    "however , unintended charged impurities , which are invariably present in the graphene environment , ( e.g. , the substrate - graphene interface ) , lead to the formation of inhomogeneous electron - hole puddles in the system @xcite , which have been confirmed by experiments@xcite using the techniques of scanning potential and tunneling microscopies . although mlg samples show a metallic behavior at high densities a weak  insulating \" temperature - dependent conductivity @xmath0 has been measured at low carrier density and at the charge neutrality point ( cnp ) @xcite .",

    "the strong insulating behavior in the temperature dependent conductivity has been observed not only near cnp but also at carrier densities as high as @xmath2@xmath3 or higher . to be more specific , in ref .  [ ] , @xmath0 in blg increases by @xmath4 as temperature @xmath5 increases from @xmath6 k for carrier density in the range @xmath7 @xmath3 . to understand this anomalous temperature dependence in @xmath0 , both mlg and blg , it is essential to know the role of disorder in graphene transport .",
    "we note that phonon scattering ( ref .  [ ] ) , although being weak in graphene , always contributes an increasing resistivity with increasing temperature and thus always leads to metallic behavior , and thus can not be the mechanism for the intriguing insulating temperature dependence often observed in graphene transport at lower carrier densities  in fact , at very high temperatures ( @xmath8 k ) graphene should always manifest metallic temperature dependence in its conductivity due to phonon scattering effects which we would ignore in the current work .",
    "our goal here is to theoretically study in a comprehensive manner the temperature dependence of graphene transport properties arising entirely from the disorder effects .",
    "the experimentally measured anomalous temperature dependent conductivity of blg has been theoretically investigated by applying the analytic statistical theory to the inhomogeneous potential fluctuation and it is found that the anomalous blg @xmath0 is likely to be caused by the electron - hole puddles induced by randomly distributed disorder in the graphene environment @xcite . in this paper , we extend this work and apply the same analytic statistical theory to mlg systems and explain the intriguing coexistence of both metallic and insulating features of mlg @xmath0 . in the presence of large fluctuating potentials @xmath9 associated with microscopic configurations of coulomb disorder in the system , the local fermi level , @xmath10 , would necessarily have large spatial fluctuations .",
    "we carry out an analytical theory implementing this physical idea by assuming that the value of the potential at any given point follows a gaussian distribution , parametrized by @xmath11 ( the root - mean - square fluctuations or the standard deviation in @xmath9 about the average potential ) .",
    "this distribution can then be used to average the local density of states to obtain effective carrier densities , which can then be used to compute the physical quantities of interest@xcite .",
    "the observed anomalous temperature dependent @xmath0 is then understood as the competition between the thermal activation of carrier density and temperature - dependent screening effects .",
    "our theory explains the suppression of the insulating behavior in higher mobility samples with lower disorder , which is consistent with experimental observations .",
    "we also provide the similarity and the quantitative difference between monolayer and bilayer graphene transport in the presence of puddles .",
    "the motivation of our theory comes from the observation that the electron - hole puddles , which dominate the low - density graphene landscape , allow for a 2-component semiclassical transport behavior , where the usual metallic diffusive carrier transport is accompanied by transport by activated carriers which have been locally thermally excited above the potential fluctuations imposed by the static disorder .",
    "this naturally allows for both insulating and metallic transport behavior occurring preferentially respectively at lower and higher carrier densities since the puddles disappear with increasing carrier density due to screening . at zero temperature ( where no activation is allowed ) or at very high carrier density ( where puddles are suppressed )",
    ", only diffusive transport is possible .",
    "but at any finite temperatures and at not too high densities , there would always be a 2-component transport with both activated and diffusive carriers contributing to conductivity .",
    "our theory develops this idea into a concrete description .",
