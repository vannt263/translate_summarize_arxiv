    "some of the most difficult , yet important , problems in computational sensing involve imaging objects that are hidden behind an opaque medium .",
    "for example , identifying a tumor inside a human body in medical diagnosis , detecting defects within a structure in industrial testing , or visualizing the shape of a multicellular organism in biology are all instances of this fundamental problem of subsurface imaging .",
    "the most commonly used approach in such applications is based on probing the medium with a controlled incident wave of a specific frequency range that can penetrate the medium , and then to rely on the physics of wave scattering to infer or visualize the spatial distribution of the refractive index within the medium .",
    "this problem of inferring the refractive index distribution from the scattered wave - field is known as inverse scattering .",
    "it is often formulated as a large - scale optimization that relies on models for describing both the physical ( forward or measurement model ) and signal - related ( regularization , prior constraints ) aspects of the problem .",
    "traditional approaches to inverse scattering are based on linear measurement models that can be obtained by assuming a straight - ray propagation of waves  @xcite , or by adopting more refined scattering models based on the first born  @xcite or rytov approximations  @xcite .",
    "recent works have demonstrated impressive imaging capability of the optimization - based approaches that also incorporate prior constraints on the solution  @xcite . in particular , dramatic improvements were obtained by relying on sparsity - promoting regularization  @xcite , which is an essential component of compressive sensing  @xcite .",
    "the basic motivation is that many natural objects are inherently sparse in some transform domain and can be reconstructed with high accuracy even with a small amount of measured data .",
    "linear measurement models , though simple and efficient , are only accurate for weakly scattering objects .",
    "this limits their applicability for imaging larger objects and/or those with large refractive index contrasts .",
    "recent experimental results also indicate that the resolution and quality of the reconstructed image is improved when nonlinear measurement models are used  @xcite .",
    "in particular , nonlinear models can account for multiple scattering and thus provide a more accurate interpretation of the measured data .",
    "we propose a new method for reconstructing the refractive index from measurements of the scattered wave - field .",
    "this method combines our nonlinear forward model with an edge - preserving total variation ( tv ) regularizer  @xcite and forms images by solving a large - scale optimization problem . our measurement model  called series expansion with accelerated gradient descent on lippmann - schwinger equation ( seagle)is based on formulating wave - scattering as a smooth optimization subproblem and using nesterov s fast gradient method  @xcite to iteratively approximate the scattered wave .",
    "the key advantage of seagle is its guaranteed convergence , even for objects with large refractive index contrasts .",
    "we provide explicit formulas for computing the gradient of our measurement model with respect to the refractive index , which enables large - scale 2d and 3d imaging using fast iterative shrinkage / thresholding algorithm ( fista )  @xcite .",
    "we validate our forward model and reconstruction method analytically and with numerical simulations .",
    "our approach expands the scattered wave field with the iterates of nesterov s accelerated gradient descent and efficiently computes the derivative of the field with respect to the object .",
