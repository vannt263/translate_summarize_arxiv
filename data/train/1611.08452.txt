    "solute transport in heterogeneous porous media displays behaviors that can not be captured by transport models based on an equivalent advection dispersion equation ( ade ) parameterized by ( constant ) effective transport parameters .",
    "such behaviors range from the non - linear evolution of solute dispersion to power - law tails in solute breakthrough curves  @xcite .",
    "the last three decades have seen intense research to quantify these behaviors in terms of effective transport models that can be obtained by moment equation approaches  @xcite , and projector formalisms  @xcite , for example , and include time and space fractional ades  @xcite , multirate mass transfer ( mrmt ) models  @xcite , as well as continuous time random walks  @xcite , see also the reviews in  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the ctrw approach to modeling non - fickian solute transport in heterogeneous media .",
    "classical random walks model particle movements by using variable spatial steps which are taken within constant time increments at equidistant times  @xcite .",
    "a ctrw , in contrast , models particle movements in a heterogeneous medium effectively as a random walk in which both space and time increments are variable .",
    "the spatial transitions may reflect the geometry of the underlying medium and flow heterogeneity , while particle transition and waiting times reflect persistent particle velocities over given transition distances , or particle retention due to adsorption or diffusion into immobile zones , for example  @xcite .",
    "the medium heterogeneity is mapped into the probability distribution density ( pdf ) of characteristic particle transition times .",
    "the evolution of the particle density , or , equivalently the solute concentration is governed by a temporally non - local ade whose memory kernel is given in terms of the pdf of transition times  @xcite .",
    "the mrmt approach is phenomenologically similar to the ctrw modeling framework as it models the impact of medium heterogeneity on large scale transport through a distribution of typical solute retention times in immobile regions .",
    "in fact , it can be shown  @xcite that one model can under certain conditions be mapped onto the other .",
    "the latter amounts essentially to identifying the relation between the pdf of particle transition times and particle retention times in immobile regions  @xcite .",
    "as pointed out above , the ctrw model is a random walk approach in that particle movements are governed by random walk equations for the space and time coordinates .",
    "therefore the solution of ctrw and equivalent models is directly accessible to numerical solution through random walk particle tracking simulations  @xcite .",
    "this provides an avenue for the efficient simulation of transport in the presence of mobile - immobile processes  @xcite , for example , and for temporally non - local transport in general  @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig3]b illustrates the breakthrough curve for @xmath172 and @xmath176 .",

    "we develop a general ctrw approach for transport under radial flow conditions starting from the random walk equations for the radial and temporal particle coordinates .",
    "in contrast to ctrw formulations under uniform flow conditions here the random transition times form a non - stationary stochastic process , which reflects the radial dependence , i.e. , non - stationarity , of the flow conditions .",
    "thus , the evolution of the solute concentration is governed by a non - local ade that is characterized by a radially dependent memory kernel . within this general framework",
    ", we present ctrw models that may account for the impact of advective heterogeneity on large scale transport , that implement multirate mass transfer between a mobile immobile regions , and that combine non - local mobile transport due to heterogeneous advection and mass transfer into immobile zones .",
    "the three models are characterized by the specific forms of the stochastic process of particle times .    for heterogeneous advection ,",
    "the transition time reflects the inverse ( heterogeneous ) flow velocity , which in average depends on the total flow rate and on the radial distance .",
    "this is accounted for by a transition time that is modeled as the product of a non - dimensional time increment and an advective transition time that is proportional to the radial distance and the inverse flow rate .",
    "thus , transition times decrease with increasing flow rate as expected for purely advective heterogeneity .",
    "flow heterogeneity is accounted for by the distribution of the dimensionless time increment  @xcite .",
    "the memory kernel of the non - local ade for solute concentration depends here on the radial distance .",
    "radial transport under multirate mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions is implemented by separating the transition time into the time the particle is mobile and the sum of immobile times , which is represented by a compound poisson process  @xcite whose mean is given by the trapping rate times the local mobile trapping time .",
    "the mobile time is modeled by an exponentially distributed dimensionless time increment , which models fickian mobile transport .",
    "the mean number of trapping events during a mobile transition is given by the trapping rate and the mean mobile time .",
    "the memory kernel here is independent of the radial distance , which reflects the fact that the individual trapping events do not depend on mobile advection , which is consistent with radial mrmt formulation that assume homogeneous advection in the mobile zone  @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose a ctrw model that combines heterogeneous advection in the mobile continuum with multirate mass transfer into immobile continua .",
    "the mobile transition time now is modeled by a non - exponential dimensionless time increment .",
    "the immobile time increment is again a compound poisson process . while the individual trapping events are independent on the heterogeneous advection , the collective of trapping times depends on the radial distance through the mean number of trapping events .",
    "unlike for the case of a homogeneous mobile advection , heterogeneity leads to an interrelation of the pdfs of mobile transition times and retention times in immobile regions , and thus to a radial dependence of the memory kernel .",
    "the derivation of the general framework from the random walk equations for the particle coordinates in space and time provides directly the random walk particle tracking methods for the numerical solution of radial mrmt models , and temporally non - local radial transport formulations in general .",
    "notice that the developed non - local transport models assume that dispersion is proportional to the flow velocity , as well as a constant injection or withdrawal rate of the flow at the well .",
    "it is straightforward to relax the first assumption and introduce a more general velocity dependence of dispersion in the developed models .",
    "the assumption of a constant flow rate may be relaxed to account for scenarios encountered in single well injection withdrawal tests , i.e. , piecewise constant flow rates .",
    "the solute breakthrough behaviors for the different non - local radial transport models are studied in detail by using random walk particle tracking simulations and explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic time behaviors of the solute breakthrough curves . a broad distribution of advective transition times is modeled by a pareto distributions of dimensionless times .",
    "the distribution of immobile times is also given by a pareto distribution , which mimics a broad distribution of diffusion or in general retention times in the immobile zones .",
    "we find distinct power - law tail behavior in all cases , which are similar to the ones that can be observed for uniform flow .",
    "however , the non - stationarity of the random time increment leads to a non - trivial radial dependence of the breakthrough curves .",
    "the model combining heterogeneous advection and mrmt can display an intermediate time regime in which heterogeneous advection dominates , before the onset of trapping , and a late time regime that is governed by the retention properties in the immobile regions .",
    "the different behaviors in the two time - regimes allow for the discrimination and identification of heterogeneous advection and mobile - immobile mass transfer as drivers of anomalous transport .",
    "the ctrw model accounting for advective heterogeneity is controlled by the flow rate , while the ctrw model for mrmt is controlled by the trapping rate and the properties of the immobile zone .    in conclusion",
    ", this paper provides a radial ctrw framework that allows for the systematic interpretation of tracer data from radial forced gradient test , through the implementation of different mechanisms that lead to non - local radial transport .",

    "<S> this paper derives and analyzes continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) models in radial flow geometries for the quantification of non - local solute transport induced by heterogeneous flow distributions and by mobile - immobile mass transfer processes . to this end </S>",
    "<S> we derive a general ctrw framework in radial coordinates starting from the random walk equations for radial particle positions and times . </S>",
    "<S> the particle density , or solute concentration is governed by a non - local radial advection - dispersion equation ( ade ) . unlike in ctrws for uniform flow scenarios , </S>",
    "<S> particle transition times here depend on the radial particle position , which renders the ctrw non - stationary . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the memory kernel characterizing the non - local ade , is radially dependent . </S>",
    "<S> based on this general formulation , we derive radial ctrw implementations that ( i ) emulate non - local radial transport due to heterogeneous advection , ( ii ) model multirate mass transfer ( mrmt ) between mobile and immobile continua , and ( iii ) quantify both heterogeneous advection in a mobile region and mass transfer between mobile and immobile regions . </S>",
    "<S> the expected solute breakthrough behavior is studied using numerical random walk particle tracking simulations . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is analyzed by explicit analytical expressions for the asymptotic solute breakthrough curves . </S>",
    "<S> we observe clear power - law tails of the solute breakthrough for broad ( power - law ) distributions of particle transit times ( heterogeneous advection ) and particle trapping times ( mrmt model ) . </S>",
    "<S> the combined model displays two distinct time regimes . </S>",
    "<S> an intermediate regime , in which the solute breakthrough is dominated by the particle transit times in the mobile zones , and a late time regime that is governed by the distribution of particle trapping times in immobile zones .    </S>",
