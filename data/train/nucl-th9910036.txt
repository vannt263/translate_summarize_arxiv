    "one of the primary goals of contemporary particle / nuclear physics is to understand the structure of the nucleon . indeed this is being pursued at the very highest energy machines such as hera and slac , at which one probes the quark / parton substructure , as well as at lower energy accelerators such as bates , elsa and mami , wherein one studies the low energy structure of the nucleon via electron scattering . in recent years",
    "another important low energy probe has been ( real ) compton scattering , by which one can study the deformation of the nucleon under the influence of quasi - static electric and/or magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "for example , in the presence of an external electric field @xmath3 the quark distribution of the nucleon becomes distorted , leading to an induced electric dipole moment @xmath4 in the direction of the applied field , where @xmath5 is the electric polarizability .",
    "the interaction of this dipole moment with the field leads to a corresponding interaction energy @xmath6 similarly in the presence of an applied magnetizing field @xmath7 there will be an induced magnetic dipole moment @xmath8 and an interaction energy @xmath9 for wavelengths large compared to the size of the system , the effective hamiltonian for the interaction of a system of charge @xmath10 and mass @xmath11 with an electromagnetic field is , of course , given by the simple form @xmath12 and the compton scattering cross section has simply the familiar thomson form @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the fine structure constant and @xmath15 are the initial , final photon energies respectively . as the energy increases , however , so does the resolution and one must take into account also polarizability effects , whereby the effective hamiltonian becomes @xmath16 the compton scattering cross section from such a system ( taken , for simplicity , to be spinless ) is given then by @xmath17.\\label{eq : sss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is clear from eq.([eq : sss ] ) that from careful measurement of the differential scattering cross section , extraction of these structure dependent polarizability terms is possible provided that i ) the energy is large enough that these terms are significant compared to the leading thomson piece and ii ) that the energy is not so large that higher order corrections become important . in this way the measurement of electric and magnetic polarizabilities for the proton has recently been accomplished using photons in the energy range 50 mev @xmath18 100 mev ,",
    "yielding@xcite scattering cross section measurements have been reported@xcite but have been questioned@xcite .",

    "@xmath19 note that in practice one generally exploits the strictures of causality and unitarity as manifested in the validity of the forward scattering dispersion relation , which yields the baldin sum rule@xcite @xmath20 as a rather precise constraint because of the small uncertainty associated with the photoabsorption cross section @xmath21 .    from these results , which imply that the polarizabilities of the proton are nearly a factor of a thousand smaller than its volume",
    ", we learn that the nucleon is a relatively rigid object when compared to the hydrogen atom , for example , for which the electric polarizability and volume are comparable .    additional probes of proton structure are possible if one exploits its spin @xmath22 .",
    "thus , for example , the presence of a time varying electric field in the plane of a rotating system of charges will lead to a charge separation with induced electric dipole moment @xmath23 and corresponding interaction energy @xmath24 where we have used the maxwell equations in writing this form .",
    "this is a quantum mechanical analog of the familiar faraday rotation .",
    "( note that the `` extra '' time or spatial derivative is required by time reversal invariance since @xmath22 is t - odd . ) similarly other possible structures are@xcite @xmath25 and the measurement of these various `` spin - polarizabilities '' @xmath26 via polarized compton scattering provides a rather different probe for nucleon structure .",
    "because of the requirement for polarization not much is known at present about such spin - polarizabilities , although from dispersion relations the combination @xmath27 has been evaluated and from a global analysis of unpolarized compton data , to which it contributes at @xmath28 , tonnison et al.@xcite have determined the so - called backward spin - polarizability to be @xmath29 clearly such measurements represent an important goal for the future .    at the same time",
    "it has come to be realized that a high resolution probe of nucleon structure is available , in principle , via the use of _ virtual _ compton scattering  vcs  wherein virtual photons produced from scattered electrons are scattered off a nucleon into real final state photons , transferring a three - momentum @xmath30 to the target .",
    "the outcome of such measurements is , in principle , @xmath30-dependent values of the polarizabilities ( usually termed `` generalized polarizabilities '' and denoted by gps in the following ) which can be thought of as the fourier transforms of _ local _ polarization densities in the nucleon . at the present time a vcs experiment has already taken place at mami , and there exist approved experiments at bates and tjnaf .",
    "preliminary results have been reported from mami and will be discussed in the conclusion @xcite .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to have a base of solid theoretical predictions with which such data can be confronted",
    ". the here presented approach , which utilizes the techniques of chiral effective theories in the heavy fermion formulation , has already yielded several results@xcite . in the first chiral calculation of generalized polarizabilities utilizing su(2 ) heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory ( hbchpt ) @xcite ,",
    "the leading momentum - dependent modification of the ( generalized ) electric ( @xmath31 ) and magnetic ( @xmath32 ) polarizabilities was analyzed .",
    "later , in a short communication@xcite , numerical studies for the full @xmath30-dependence of all 10 generalized ( guichon ) polarizabilities were presented  again using the framework of su(2 ) hbchpt . in this work",
    "we present the details behind the numerical study of ref.@xcite and , for the first time in the field of vcs , are able to present simple analytical expressions for all gps in a momentum range from @xmath33 gev@xmath34 utilizing su(2 ) hbchpt .",
    "these new expressions greatly facilitate the study of the influence of the chiral `` pion cloud '' on the gps and the comparison with model calculations .",

    "one correspondence between the real compton polarizabilities and the gps of guichon et al . in vcs@xcite .",
    "the advantage of vcs lies in the virtual nature of the initial state photon and the associated possibility of an _ independent _ variation of photon energy and momentum , thus rendering access to a much greater variety of structure information than in the case of real compton scattering .",
    "for example , one can hope to identify individual signatures of specific nucleon resonances which can not be obtained in other processes@xcite . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that a great deal of theoretical work already exists , such as predictions within a non  relativistic constituent quark model@xcite , a one  loop calculation in the linear sigma model@xcite , a born term model including nucleon resonance effects@xcite , a hbchpt calculation of the leading @xmath30-dependence of the generalized electric and magnetic polarizability @xcite , a calculation of @xmath41 in the skyrme model@xcite and the numerical study of all 10 gps again utilizing hbchpt @xcite . for an overview of the status at higher energies and in the deep inelastic regime",

    "in addition , mixed ",
    "type polarizabilities , @xmath53 , have been introduced , which are neither purely electric nor purely coulomb type .",
    "it is important to note that the above definitions are based on the kinematical approximation that the multipoles are expanded around @xmath54 and _ only terms linear in @xmath39 are retained _ , which , together with current conservation , yields selection rules for the possible combinations of quantum numbers of the gps . in this approximation , 10 gps have been introduced in @xcite as functions of @xmath55 : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 .    however , recently it has been proven@xcite , using crossing symmetry and charge conjugation invariance , that only _ six _ of the above ten gps are independent . with @xmath66 and @xmath67 being the nucleon mass ,",

    "however , the chiral analysis performed here shows that to leading order only 4 of the 7 spin gps can be calculated@xmath75 .",
    "naturally we focus on these four spin gps , as @xmath76 possess an extra suppression factor of @xmath77 ( see section [ hbchptspin ] ) which pushes them outside the validitiy of our analysis .",
    "still , one can reconstruct the whole set of spin gps via eq.([cinv ] ) if one wishes to do so .",

    "it is therefore advantageous to formulate an effective field theory which keeps the resonance as an explicit degree of freedom .",
    "in addition to this dynamical consideration there is also another practical concern regarding the inclusion of resonance effects via counterterms . even if simple born exchange might be the dominant contribution of a particular resonance , the local counterterm in the chiral lagrangian that subsumes this effect might be of higher order in the calculation , so that the leading and even the subleading result can misrepresent the perturbative series .",
    "a well - known example of this type are the so - called spin - polarizabilities of the nucleon , wherein one encounters very large contributions due to @xmath35(1232 ) born graphs that only start contributing via counterterms at @xmath116 in the chiral calculation ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) . situations of this type require a `` resummation '' of the standard chiral expansion in order to push resonance effects into lower orders to restore meaningful perturbative expansions for quantities of interest in low energy baryon physics .    in order to address these two different but related issues in the field of resonance physics in baryon chpt , the so called `` small scale expansion '' of su(2 ) baryon chpt has recently been formulated @xcite . in this chiral effective theory one",

    "of course , this modification of the chiral counting implies that one has to repeat the whole procedure of construction of the lagrangian and the determination of counterterms and coupling constants , even for processes which only involve nucleons in the initial and final states . for first results regarding the modified renormalization of nucleon parameters we refer to @xcite .    for our calculation",

    ", there exist ten such gps , three being associated with spin - independent correlations and seven connected with spin - flip structures . at third order both in hbchpt and in sse only six of these  two spin - independent and four spin - dependent ",
    "survive , and we have calculated these directly . in the case of the @xmath35-pole and @xmath202 loop contributions , we were able to obtain results for the gps which are simple analytic forms , while in the case of the corrresponding @xmath267-continuum contributions only numerical results could be given .",
    "we briefly discussed the results from the first vcs experiment on the proton from mainz at @xmath268 gev@xmath34 .",
    "the success in predicting the measured response functions resulted from a combination of a sharp falloff of @xmath269 , a slight rise of @xmath270 and a strong incarease in the contributing spin gps with momentum - transfer @xmath30 .",
    "all these effects are intimately related to the chiral dynamics of the pion cloud , which can be calculated very precisely in chiral effective theories like hbchpt and sse  with hbchpt at least in the spin - independent sector having the better convergence behaviour as far as we can tell at this point .",
    "in particular , for the case of the generalized magnetic polarizability both hbchpt and sse predict a _ rising _ behaviour as one goes away from the real photon point@xmath271up to a momentum @xmath272 gev@xmath34 .",
    "this is a distinctive feature of the chiral calculations and generally not found in simple quark model evaluations .",
    "it expresses the feature that chiral invariance requires local regions _ both _ of paramagnetic ( at small distances ) and diamagnetic ( at larger distances ) magnetic polarizability densities in the nucleon . aside from the widely discussed @xmath30-dependences of the generalized electric and magnetic polarizabilities , the strong variation of the gps in the spin - sector is likely to be of interest for further study , both on the experimental and on the theoretical side . considering the results of the chiral calculations for the spin polarizabilities in real compton scattering we believe that the @xmath2 sse calculation should be quite competitive with the @xmath1 hbchpt analysis at least as far as the generalized spin - polarizabilities are concerned .",
    "future measurements at bates , mami and tjnaf will clarify this issue .",
    "it goes without saying that our calculation is preliminary in that it does not include important corrections arising at @xmath273see , _",
    "e.g. _ the discussed normalization problems in @xmath274 .",
    "an @xmath103 hbchpt analysis has been carried out in the case of the real compton electric and magnetic polarizabilities in ref.@xcite and important corrections and uncertainties were found which , while not drastically modifying the basic numerical predictions obtained at @xmath1 , did introduce sizable uncertainties into the predictions due to unknown counterterms which had to be estimated via resonance exchange .",
    "we may then anticipate a similar behavior here  that such higher order corrections will not change the basic pattern of the chiral @xmath275 predictions , but mainly only correct the ( photon - point ) normalization .",
    "however , verification of this assumption awaits detailed future calculations .",
    "lastly , we stress once more the motivation for performing electron scattering experiments on the nucleon : different theoretical approaches may yield comparable results at the real photon point , but the details of the underlying dynamics can be analyzed in a much more powerful way by studying the @xmath276-dependence . in conclusion ,",
