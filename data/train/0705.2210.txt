    "three of the four detector concepts which have been proposed for the linear collider foresee a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) as a main tracker .",
    "this allows continuous tracking to be performed , yet with a minimal amount of matter . depending on the detailed designs , the tpc should have about 200 padrows with a space resolution between 100 and 150 microns in the r@xmath0 direction .",
    "mainly three technologies are currently considered for the gas amplification in these tpcs : a multi - wire proportionnal chamber ( mwpc ) , a micromegas chamber , and a multigem structure . to this end , r&d has been pursued since the beginning of the decade within the lc - tpc collaboration@xcite and has lead to the construction of several prototypes .",
    "it was felt useful to gather around a single experiment and to have a way of comparing the various technologies in a well - defined framework , with the same readout electronics and chamber geometry .",
    "this is the purpose of the asian - canadian - european multi - prototype collaboration .",
    "it started with the construction of a mwpc chamber in mpi munich , which took beam data at kek in april 2004 .",
    "then the chamber was equipped with a triple - gem structure and took beam data in april 2005 .",
    "this paper reports on a beam test carried out with a micromegas endplate in june 2005 .",
    "the detector and the operation conditions are described in section 2 , where an assessment of data quality is given . the results on gas properties ( drift velocity , diffusion ) are presented in section 3 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the spatial resolution of the device .",
    "it starts with a theory elaborated in our group which is then compared to simulations and measurements .",
    "fundamental limitations from the gas mixture and pad geometry are assessed and consequences for a linear collider tpc are drawn .",
    "this experiment was carried out using the @xmath1 beam line at the kek 12 gev ps .",
    "the beam line provided a secondary beam of pions or protons with momenta up to 4  gev / c through the interaction of 12 gev protons on a be target , followed by the charge and momentum selection with a set of dipole magnets .",
    "the beam spill has a flat top of @xmath2  s with a repetition rate of @xmath3  hz . there were 4 scintillation counters , tc1 through tc4 , whose 4-fold coincidence triggered the data acquisition on 4  gev negatively charged pions .",
    "a typical trigger rate was @xmath4  hz . the first two trigger counters , tc1 and tc2 , were placed at the entrance of the beam just downstream of a beam slit to control the beam intensity and had an overlap region of @xmath5  @xmath6 .",
    "the other two trigger counters , tc3 and tc4 , were located at 8  m downstream of tc1 and tc2 , that is , just in front of our multi - prototype tpc ( mp - tpc ) .",
    "tc3 and tc4 had an overlap region of @xmath7  @xmath6 that matched the drift region of the chamber .",
    "the mp - tpc together with tc3 and tc4 were installed in a persistent current solenoidal magnet ( pcmag ) having a bore diameter of @xmath8  cm and a length of @xmath9  m with a very thin wall of @xmath10  % radiation lengths .",
    "the magnet capable of creating a field up to 1.2 tesla was operated in the closed loop mode and provided a field uniformity better than @xmath11  % in the drift region of the mp - tpc that was aligned with the magnet axis , so that the electric drift field was parallel to the magnetic field .    in the following ,",
    "unless otherwise stated , the beam was shot perpendicular to the drift axis of the mp - tpc .",
    "the nominal size of the beam in these conditions is about 4 cm at the chamber . to cover the whole active volume of the mp - tpc",
    ", we hence spread the beam by inserting a 5  cm - thick lead brick just downstream of tc1 and tc2 in the normal data taking conditions .",
    "the mp - tpc has a cylindrical drift region of 261  mm in length and 145 mm in diameter . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mptpc ] ,    the field cage is made of fourteen 15  mm - wide circular rings spaced 3.2 mm apart and a cathode disk with a small hole at its centerfe source enter the drift volume , for gain calibration and monitoring purposes . ] .",
    "all of these are embedded into a gas - tight vessel , which is closed on one side by a detachable endplate detector that carries a micromegas foil and readout pads .",
    "the ring closest to the micromegas detector is at a distance of 6  mm from the mesh .",
    "the micromegas endplate , built in saclay and orsay , consists of a 0.8 mm thick printed circuit board bearing anode pads , with a mesh stretched on a frame and mounted above the pad plane .",
    "the mesh is @xmath12 m thick cu having circular holes of @xmath13 m in diameter placed with a @xmath14 m pitch .",
    "the @xmath15 mm@xmath16 frame leaves a @xmath17 mm@xmath16 active area .",
    "a 50-micron gap is maintained between the mesh and the pad plane by kapton pillars . in normal operation",
    "a voltage of about 350  v is applied to the mesh relative to the pad plane at 0  v. the resulting electrostatic force sticks the mesh to the anode plane .",
    "there are 12 rows of 32 pads on the anode plane .",
    "each pad has a rectangular shape and is placed at a pitch of 6.3 mm along the beam ( @xmath18 direction ) and 2.3 mm transverse to the beam ( @xmath19 direction ) .",
    "the chamber is filled with an argon mixture containing 5% isobutane and is operated at room temperature and at atmospheric pressure .",
    "the 12 rows of 32 readout pads ( 384 in total ) are connected via @xmath20  cm long flat cables to 24 aleph preamplifiers@xcite , each having 16 channels and reading out a half of a pad row . the shaped signals from the preamplifiers are sent to aleph tpds ( tpc digitizers ) in a fastbus crate via @xmath21  m long twisted pair cables and are sampled at a rate of 12.5 mhz and digitized over 8 bits .",
    "the data are then read out , via a fastbus - vsb translator unit , @xmath22 , by a vme board computer , @xmath23 , operating on os/2 .",
    "the readout data are stored via tcp / ip connection on a linux pc in the lcio format@xcite .",
    "the data acquisition time is about @xmath24s per event , which limited the data acquisition speed to about @xmath25 event per spill .      a typical event taken at a magnetic field of 0.5 t is shown in fig .  [ fig : evtdisp ] .    during the data taking , the gain was continuously monitored by a @xmath26fe source .",
    "the mesh signal was readout by a fast charge amplifier ortec 142b and the signal was sampled with an amptek multi - channel analyser mca8000 . a spectrum obtained this way is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spect ] where the 5.9 kev line and the escape line in argon are seen .",
    "the source was not collimated .",
    "the landau distribution of the ionisation produced by the 4 gev pions from the beam is also visible and peaks at 12.5 kev as expected for the 75 mm active length of gas . over a period of 60 hours",
    "the extreme variations of gain were @xmath273% and the r.m.s .",
    "gain variations were 3 per mil over this period .",
    "the gain is measured as a function of the mesh voltage ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gain ] ) .",
    "the data presented here were taken at a mesh voltage of 320 v , corresponding to a gain of 3650 , in a magnetic field of 0.5 and @xmath28 t , and a mesh voltage of 340  v ( gain of 7500 ) for the data taken with no magnetic field .",
    "a total of 4020 triggers were collected at @xmath29 t , 6111 at @xmath30 t and 5166 at @xmath31 t .",
    "the temperature was 28 to 32 @xmath32c during the data taking .",
    "the gas pressure in the vessel followed the atmospheric pressure which was stable during the runs used in this paper .    in the following analyses ,",
    "the first two and last two padrows , as well as the four leftmost and two rightmost pads of each row , are not used in the measurements , to avoid edge effects . however , when a hit is found close to the edges of this fiducial region , the neighbouring pad(s ) in the region are recovered and used in the track reconstruction .    the azimuthal angle distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataqual]a .",
    "as stated earlier a wide beam was obtained by adding a @xmath33cm - thick lead brick in the beam line .",
    "the resulting @xmath34 distribution of the tracks is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dataqual]b .",
    "the uniformity of the detector can be assessed from the average residual vs track position in @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dataqual]c ) and vs padrow number fig .",
    "[ fig : dataqual]d for the 8 fiducial padrows . distortions up to 50 microns are observed at non - zero magnetic field ( likely to be due to @xmath35 effects ) , but they do not affect the resolution measurements where only the r.m.s . of the residuals is considered .",
    "the exactly same data sample has been analysed with two independent analysis methods and compared in the following .",
    "they differ primarily by the way the track parameters are fitted to the pad data in the @xmath19-@xmath18 plane .",
    "the geometrical track parameters are the intercept of the track with the @xmath36 axis ( @xmath37 ) , the azimuth at this point ( @xmath38 ) , and the inverse radius of curvature @xmath39 .    in the first method , a global maximum - likelihood fit of the geometrical track parameters , together with the track width ( @xmath40 ) to the charge of the pads is carried out@xcite . in other words ,",
    "a track is represented by an arc of a circle with a gaussian charge spread of width @xmath40 along the @xmath19 direction , and @xmath40 is an additional fit parameter .",
    "the pad charge and time are determined as follows : the adc counts of the 3 preceding and 3 following the time bucket where the maximum is reached are added together with the bucket of maximum charge .",
    "this sum is required to exceed a minimum of 7 adc counts for the pad to be included in a hit .",
    "the time associated to the hit pad is the charge - weighted average of the seven buckets used in the charge integration .",
    "the log - likelihood function which is maximised with respect to the 4 track parameters reads : @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the fraction of the charge expected in pad @xmath43 , obtained by integration over the pad of a function with a gaussian profile transverse to the track .",
    "@xmath44 is the number of electrons before amplification corresponding to the charge readout on the pad @xmath43 .",
    "this method is implemented in the fortran 95 program ftpc@xcite .    in the second method ,",
    "a @xmath45 fit is performed to hit points on a row - by - row basis .",
    "the method is implemented in c++ and available as the double - fit program@xcite .",
    "the double - fit program starts with cluster finding in the plane of pad - number vs time - bucket for each pad row . to build a 2-dimensional ( @xmath19 and @xmath34 ) cluster ,",
    "consecutive time buckets are summed , starting from the first pulse encountered above @xmath46 adc counts , up to the first below 6 counts .",
    "such a hit is accepted if its peak pulse height exceeds @xmath21 adc counts .",
    "the coordinates of the hit is then calculated as its charge barycenter .",
    "following the cluster finding , the program then performs a @xmath45 fit of either a straight line at @xmath47 or a circle at @xmath48 or @xmath49 t .",
    "measuring the drift velocity of gas mixtures is an interesting test of the electron transport simulation in gases , or alternatively can be considered as a check of gas purity and composition .",
    "the drift field was set to 220 v / cm and the detector was taken outside the magnet , itself not energized . for this measurement a novel and very simple technique was used : the beam was shot at an angle of 45 degrees to the center of the cathode .",
    "a @xmath50 @xmath6 scintillator was added in the trigger to select pions crossing the cathode plane in the center .",
    "electrons from ionisation close to the cathode drift all the way along the axis of the tpc reaching the central pads of the detector , in the region where no electric - field distortions are expected .",
    "the tpd measures the time elapsed between the trigger arrival and the signal arrival .",
    "the end - point of this time distribution , added to the delay between the trigger and the readout , is the time taken by the electrons to drift along the 260.8 mm chamber .",
    "the drift time is found to be @xmath51 .",
    "the trigger delay was measured to be @xmath52 .",
    "adding a rough estimate of @xmath53 for the nim to ecl converter at the entrance of the tpd , and subtracting an estimated @xmath54ns for the pad signal delay in the @xmath55 m readout cables , the total drift time is measured to be @xmath56 . dividing the chamber length by this time yields @xmath57 .",
    "an alternative method has also been used , with a wide beam perpendicular to the axis of the chamber and also measuring the endpoint of the time distribution .",
    "it leads to the value of @xmath58 , in agreement with the former .",
    "these two values are combined assuming fully correlated systematics to yield the measurement of the drift velocity of electrons in ar+5% isobutane mixture at an electric field of 220 v / cm of @xmath59 this value is used for the determination of the @xmath34 coordinate of the hits along the axis of the chamber in the following data analyses .",
    "this measurement is in very good agreement with the magboltz@xcite prediction of @xmath60 .",
    "the uncertainty on the prediction is dominated by the error on the gas composition , stemming from a 2% uncertainty on the isobutane gas flow .",
    "no consideration on the model , the approximations nor on the input data used in the simulation enter this estimate of the prediction uncertainty .      for large enough drift distances",
    ", so that the ionisation charge is spread over several pads , the width of the track @xmath40 allows the determination of the diffusion constant @xmath61 using the relation @xmath62 .    in the global likelihood method ,",
    "@xmath40 is obtained by maximising the track likelihood simultaneously for the geometrical track parameters .",
    "[ fig : diff ] shows for the 3 values of the magnetic field the relation between the average @xmath63 and the drift distance @xmath34 .",
    "the expected linear dependence on the drift distance @xmath34 , for large @xmath34 , is clearly seen . the data at low @xmath34 , where the sensitivity to @xmath40 is lost and where the spread in track widths is comparable to the average track width , are not included into the linear fit .",
    "the slight offset in the case of zero magnetic field , corresponding to 0.3 mm added in quadrature to the track width , can probably be attributed to delta rays . at higher fields the path of these delta - ray electrons",
    "are expected to be limited by the magnetic field .",
    "the fitted @xmath61 values are given in the first line of table  [ tab : cd ] .",
    "the quoted uncertainties include systematics from the noise level and threshold used to reconstruct the hits .    in the second method ,",
    "the average fraction of the charge falling on a given pad is plotted as a function of the distance between the track and the pad center .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix [ prf ] ) that for large enough drift distances and for high enough magnetic fields to curl up delta - ray electrons , this distribution becomes gaussian and its width scales as @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the pad pitch .",
    "the measured values of @xmath61 by this method are shown in the second line of the table .",
    "these two measurements are in good agreement with each other and with the magboltz prediction , at the level of a few percent .",
    ".diffusion constants in @xmath66 measured by two methods and magboltz prediction [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : neff ]      conforted that the theory of resolution presented here is a pertinent approximation for a micromegas tpc , we can use it to predict what can be expected in the 4 tesla case , as proposed for the linear collider tpc .",
    "[ fig : extrapiso ] represents the expected resolution as a function of @xmath34 , for two values of the pitch for the gas studied in this paper .",
    "one can see that at such a high magnetic field , the diffusion , with a constant of 63 @xmath67m/@xmath68 , is not sufficient to spread the charge enough .",
    "this results in the fact that the hodoscope effect is felt up to distances over one meter in the case of a 2.3  mm pitch .",
    "even a 1  mm pitch , which would require a very dense readout electronics and would feature pads with a large aspect ratio , would not allow the target average resolution of 100 @xmath67 m to be reached .    in the case of the triple mixture ar : isobutane : cf@xmath69 ( 95:2:3 ) , with a record diffusion constant as low as 26 @xmath67m/@xmath68 ,",
    "the situation is even more catastrophic : the hodoscope effect is felt over all distances even with 1  mm pads ( fig .",
    "[ fig : extrapmix ] ) .",
    "this study shows that , to obtain the target resolution required to fulfill the ilc physics program , either smaller , digital pads are necessary , or a spreading of the charge onto several pads has to be implemented after amplification .",
    "the latter can be achieved either in a multi - gem structure by maximizing the natural defocusing in the transfer between two gems , or by the use of a resistive - capacitive continuous layer ( resistive foil ) as proposed by some of us  @xcite .",
    "successful operation of a micromegas tpc in a test beam enabled us to measure its spatial resolution under a magnetic field as well as the properties of an ar isobutane mixture .",
    "the drift velocity and the transverse diffusion constant for at @xmath70 and @xmath49 t are found to be in good agreement with the predictions of magboltz .",
    "the obtained spatial resolution as a function of drift distance is well reproduced by an analytical calculation developed in this paper .",
    "the effective number of electrons @xmath71 is measured to be @xmath72 , which is consistent with an estimate based on the primary ionisation statistics and the gas gain fluctuations .",
    "the extrapolation to the conditions of the linear collider shows that the goal resolution of 100 microns can not be reached with @xmath73 mm pads with the technique used in this test , and that another technique will probably be necessary ( digital smaller pad readout or resistive anode readout , for instance ) .",
