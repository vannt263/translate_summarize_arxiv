    "taking into account rapidly growing sensitivity of x - ray detectors we can apply to x - ray data more complicated techniques of time series analysis .",
    "especially it could be useful to analyse properties of variability in different energy ranges to detect different physical mechanisms which form behaviour of x - ray sources .",
    "the idea of energy - dependent time series analysis use binning of x - ray data both in time and energy space ( so called `` dynamic spectra '' , @xcite ) . as a result , we can calculate power spectra of light curves for each ( narrow enough ) energy bin .",
    "resulting set of power spectra can be showed as a function of two variables : energy and time - scale .",
    "such product we called as `` energy - dependent power spectra '' ( edps ) .",
    "to test capabilities of proposed technique we have modeled dynamic spectrum as a product of two variable power laws with different photo - indexes ( eq.1 ) .      where @xmath1 is energy , @xmath2 is time , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are power law functions and photo - indexes and @xmath5 are periods . in the model",
    "we have used the next values @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 sec and @xmath10 sec .",
    "resulting edps one can see in fig.1 .",
    "in fig.2 we showed edps map for chandra observations of intermediate polar gk per ( archive dataset 650 ) . here",
    "quantum statistics is not enough to analyse spin variability of gk per .",
    "detected at energies about 3 kev variations with time - scale larger than 80 ksec corresponds to orbital variability trend of x - ray flux .",
    "so we can conclude that edps is perspective technique to analyse data of future x - ray missions with higher sensitivity of detectors ."
