    "hyperfine quenching in atoms and ions @xcite is the shortening of excited - state lifetimes by the interaction of the electron shell with the magnetic moment of the atomic nucleus . a particularly drastic hyperfine quenching effect is observed in alkaline - earth - like and , in general , divalent atoms and ions ( with valence shell @xmath7 ) where the first excited level above the ground state is the @xmath8 state .",

    "[ fig : tsr ] ) .",
    "a channeltron - based detector @xcite was used behind the cooler and a scintillation detector @xcite was employed behind the target . because the ions moved with high velocities of 510% of the speed of light the detection efficiency was practically 100% for both detectors .",
    "after injection of ion pulses into the tsr and subsequent electron - cooling of the stored ion beam , the recombined s@xmath41 ion signal was recorded as a function of electron - ion collision energy for both @xmath1s@xmath2 and @xmath3s@xmath2 ions using well established procedures ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "further details and comprehensive results of the s@xmath2 recombination measurements will be published elsewhere , since only a very narrow range of electron - ion collision energies is of interest for the present study .",

    "these belong to the @xmath42 manifold of resonances associated with @xmath43 excitation of s@xmath2(@xmath44 ) ground - state ions .",
    "the much weaker resonance at 0.4  ev is only visible in the @xmath1s@xmath2 spectrum .",
    "it is associated with the excitation of ions which are initially in the practically infinitely long - lived @xmath6 metastable excited state .",

    "therefore , it can be safely assumed that the fractions of primary ions in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 states were negligibly small during all measurements .    for the @xmath3s isotope",

    "the electron - ion collision energy in the cooler was set to 0.4  ev and the recombination signal from the @xmath48 dr resonance was recorded for up to @xmath55220  s. then , the remaining ions were kicked out of the tsr and a new ion pulse was injected .",
    "this sequence was repeated for several hours in order to reduce statistical uncertainties to a level as low as achievable within the limited amount of available beam time .",
    "because of a small vacuum leak in the recombination detector at the target , this detector could not be used without compromising the residual gas pressure in the tsr and , consequently , considerably shortening the beam lifetime .",
    "therefore , for all resonance - decay curve measurements the cooler was used as an electron target .",
    "as mentioned above , a change of the isotope required the change of the sample in the ion source .",
    "moreover , the accelerator settings had to be slightly retuned .",

    "[ fig : allfits ] , a few general properties can be observed :    \\(a ) substantial differences are seen between the three pairs of curves for the data sets a ",

    "a and b , the relative contribution of the background to the measured signal is much larger than in c. therefore , the a and b curves are dominated by the collision - induced ion beam loss .",
    "the electron - induced signal here represents a small contribution only , though it still can be analyzed as discussed below .",
    "in contrast , the electron - induced signal dominates for case c.    \\(b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfits]i of data set c , the electron - induced destruction of primarily the metastable s@xmath56 ions leads to a rather fast beam loss during the first @xmath5530  s. later , only the collision - induced signal from the ground - state beam , with longer lifetime , is left .",
    "\\(c ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : allfits]j of data set c , an even faster initial decay is clearly seen .",
    "this is caused by the additional , hfi radiative decay of the metastable state , leading to a corresponding sharp decrease of the electron - induced signal , before the collision - induced background takes over .",

    "more precise values for the ion velocity are given in tab .",
    "[ tab : exppar ] .",
    "the cooler was used as a recombination target with the electron - ion collision energy set to 0.4  ev .",
    "the target was used for continuous electron cooling of the ion beam .",
    "this mode of operation provided stable reproducible conditions only for up to 24 hours .",
    "after that the photocathode @xcite of the target routinely had to be replaced by a freshly prepared one .",
    "it turned out that the emission characteristics of the various photocathodes used were significantly different , causing different target electron beam profiles , and the residual gas pressures in the target region of the tsr changed after a new cathode was installed at the target . since the altered conditions influenced the ion - beam lifetime considerably ,",
    "measurements before and after a cathode change could not be combined into one data set .",

    "time zero is october 1st , 2010 at 16:14 . during the gap between 12 and 16 h",
    "the isotope was changed from @xmath3s to @xmath1s .",
    "the pressures remained nearly constant over the entire measurement time of data set a. it should be noted that the absolute pressure values bear rather large ( unknown ) uncertainties . ]      in order to avoid complications due to target cathode changes , the target was switched off during the measurements of data sets b and c. the cooler was used for both electron cooling and as recombination target . the cooler is equipped with a thermionic cathode which can easily be operated with stable performance for several days .",
    "the electron energy was switched alternatingly between cooling energy , i.e. , zero electron - ion collision energy , and an electron - ion collision energy of 0.4 ev .",
    "dwell times of 20  ms were used after each energy jump and data were taken only during the last 10  ms of each dwell time interval .",

    "[ fig : allfits]a and [ fig : allfits]b ) .",
    "this change in beam lifetime by about 50% is largely due to differences between the tsr vacuum conditions of october 2010 and those of april 2011 .      for data set c ( figs .",
    "[ fig : allfits]i and [ fig : allfits]j ) a higher ion energy of about 225 mev was used .",
    "the higher energy was realized by operating tsr in synchrotron mode after each injection of a new ion pulse . in order to keep the ions circulating during acceleration the magnetic fields were ramped synchronously to higher values .",
    "no more than 50% of the ions were lost during this phase which lasted 6 s. ion currents after ramping amounted to up to 17  @xmath33a . the magnetic field in the tsr dipole magnets",
    "was increased roughly by a factor of 2 ( tab .",
    "[ tab : exppar ] ) .",
    "the same sequence of jumps in electron - ion collision energy was applied as for data set b. because of the higher ion velocities this had to be realized at correspondingly higher laboratory electron energies .",
    "under the assumption that the target electron density and the partial pressures of the residual - gas components do not change during the measurement , the time evolution of the populations @xmath57 and @xmath58 of the metastable @xmath6 state and of the @xmath59 ground state , respectively , can be obtained from solving the following set of rate equations @xcite : @xmath60 where the rates @xmath61 refer to various atomic processes that populate or depopulate states @xmath31 and @xmath62 .",
