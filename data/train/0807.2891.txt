    "the copernican principle states that we do not occupy any special place in the universe . the friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) models are built on this principle , and provide a remarkably precise description of cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "one could therefore think of this as an indirect demonstration of the copernican principle .",
    "however , homogeneous and isotropic flrw models are not the only solutions of einsteins equations which are able to fit cosmological observations .",
    "in particular , a number of inhomogeneous models have been proposed , each of which are able to describe the evolution of distance with redshift as measured via type - ia supernova ( snia ) without need of a cosmological constant @xcite ( see @xcite for a review ) . moreover ,",
    "these models may be constructed in such a way that they describe the details of the cosmic microwave background power spectrum ( cmb )  @xcite . by eshuing the constraint of inhomogeneity",
    ", these inhomogeneous models violate the copernican principle and suggest that we live near the center of a large ( of several gigaparsecs diameter ) highly isotropic void .",
    "inhomogeneous models are able to fit a variety of sets of cosmological observations without containing a cosmological constant because the lack of homogeneity offers a great degree of flexibility @xcite . for example , since the last scattering surface is separated from regions where supernova are observed by great distances , the property of inhomogeneity allows a model to be constructed which provides different physical densities in the regions from which these two sets of observational data are drawn .",
    "thus , what is required to constrain inhomogeneous solutions to the apparent acceleration of the universe includes several sets of data that measure a range of observables at comparable redshifts . in this paper",
    "we confront two general classes of inhomogeneous , dark energy free models with observations of snia , with measurements of the baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) , and with the variation of the hubble parameter with redshift .",
    "all these observational data are drawn from @xmath0 .",
    "we begin by describing the lamatre ",
    "tolman model ( the simplest spherically symmetric inhomogeneous generalization of flrw model ) , and then construct a range of 2-parameter models to describe a local large scale inhomogeneity .",
    "we then discuss constraints on the scale of these inhomogeneities based on existing and forthcoming data .",
    "the lematre  tolman ( lt ) model @xcite is a spherically symmetric , pressure free , irrotational solution of the einstein equations .",
    "its metric has the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 . because of the signature @xmath3",
    ", the @xmath4 function must obey @xmath5 here a prime ( @xmath6 ) denotes @xmath7 .",
    "the einstein equations reduce to the following two @xmath8 @xmath9 where @xmath10 is another arbitrary function and @xmath11 . here a dot ( @xmath12 ) denotes @xmath13 .",
    "when @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the density becomes infinite .",
    "this happens at shell crossings , and is an additional singularity to the big bang that occurs at @xmath16 . by setting the initial conditions appropriately the shell crossing singularity can be avoided ( see @xcite for detail discussion ) .",
    "equation ( [ vel ] ) can be solved by simple integration :    @xmath17,\\ ] ]    where @xmath18 appears as an integration constant and is an arbitrary function of @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the big bang is not a single event as in the flrw models , but occurs at different times at different distances from the origin . to define a particular lt model two functions",
    "must be specified as initial conditions .",
    "for completeness we note that in the flrw limit @xmath20 [ where @xmath21 is the scale factor ] , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "in this paper we consider two families of models , in which the cosmological constant is set to zero ( @xmath24 ) and the observer is situated at the origin",
    ". the most popular way to explain snia without @xmath25 is to postulate a large scale void centered near our position @xcite",
    ". the density distribution at the current instant in this first family may be parametrized by ( see fig .",

    "( [ den ] ) and ( [ evo ] ) respectively .    a second possible explanation for the apparent acceleration observed using snia is inspired by the so called hubble bubble . in the hubble bubble phenomenon the expansion rate at distances beyond 100 mpc is postulated to be slower than it is locally @xcite .",
    "such a phenomenon could be described by a second family of models parametrized using ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xmath31 . \\label{expfl}\\ ] ] in these models density is assumed to be homogeneous at the current epoch .",
    "the function @xmath29 can be calculated using the above relation and eq .",

    "the radial geodesics and redshift are calculated from @xcite @xmath32 and the luminosity distance is @xmath33 .",
    "in this paper we confront the inhomogeneous models described above with three sets of observations .",
    "firstly , we consider observations of type - ia supernova , which are taken from the union data set @xcite .",
    "in addition we also present the constraints coming from the riess gold data set @xcite , which until recently has been the most popular sample for testing inhomogeneous models .",
    "the second set of cosmological observations comprise measurement of the dilation scale of the bao in the redshift space power - spectrum of 46,748 luminous red galaxies ( lrg ) from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",

    "the measured value of the dilation scale at @xmath37 is 1370 @xmath38 64 mpc @xcite 64 mpc was obtained within the framework of the linear perturbations imposed on a homogeneous flrw background .",
    "it is still an open question whether such analysis is appropriate or should be carried out instead in the lt background .",

    "indeed , using the procedure described above would allow us to fit the supernovae data with almost any model .",

    "owing to the flexibility of inhomogeneous models we can always assume that our void is surrounded by an overdense or underdense region  there is not need to assume that the universe consists only of the void of gpc - radius and everywhere else is homogeneous .",

    "thus , the high redshift data does not significantly constrain the properties of a local inhomogeneity ( see appendix for more details ) . to tighten the constraints on the properties of the local gpc - scale inhomogeneity we need more precise data sets at low redshift which can be directly compared with constraints from existing data sets such as type - ia supernovae . among these observations ,",
    "the most valuable are those of distance , of the hubble parameter , or measurements like baryonic acoustic oscillations and the alcock  paczyski tests which depend on both the hubble parameter and distance .",
    "for example , precise measurements of a maximum in the angular diameter distance distance would place very tight constraints @xcite .",

    "in addition and the position of maximum for model bf 1 is shifted by @xmath71 relative to the @xmath25cdm model .",
    "however , current estimates of the angular distance from snia are predominantly at @xmath72 , and are not sufficiently precise to discriminate between models on this basis .",
    "other state of the art the measurements of the distance based on the sunyaev - zeldovich effect are also too imprecise  @xcite .",
    "another possible test that has been proposed in the literature is based on the time drift of cosmological redshift , i.e. a measurement of @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "however , this requires a very precise measurement since the typical amplitude of the effect is @xmath74 on a time scale of 10 years @xcite .",
    "another possible test was proposed in @xcite , which relies on studying the consistency relation between the distance on the null cone and the hubble parameter .",
    "such relation does not hold if the geometry of the universe differs from the flrw geometry .",
    "of more immediate utility are methods based on spectral distortions of the cmb power spectrum @xcite .",
    "these have already been used to put an upper bound of @xmath75 1 gpc for the radius of a local gpc - scale void @xcite .",
    "in addition , a study of the kinematic sunyaev ",
    "zeldovich effect has recently been used by garca - bellido and haugblle @xcite to estimate the properties of a local void .",

    "we recall from sec .",
    "[ sec5.1 ] that a void with @xmath77 gpc and @xmath78 fits the data with @xmath79 , which means that that the model can be rejected at only the @xmath80 level , which is insufficient to rule out this possibility .",
    "moreover , cosmic - flow models , although not tested with these type of observations ( ksz effect and spectral distortion ) , require an inhomogeneity of radius also around 1 gpc .",
    "therefore , there is a need for future observational constraints to either confirm or rule out the existence of these large inhomogeneities .    of considerable promise for the future",
    "are very precise measurements of supernova in the redshift range of 0.1 - 0.4 @xcite . in this redshift range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) measurements of over 2000 supernova ( for example by the joint dark energy mission ) will be sufficient to reassure existence of such a void .",
    "however , in the near future the most promising candidate for testing inhomogeneous cosmological models are bao measurements .",
    "current measurements of bao from lrg sdss ( for an up to date status see @xcite ) already add additional constrains ( figs .  [ fig3 ] and [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the wigglez project will soon measure the dilation distance with accuracy of @xmath81 at @xmath82 . in the next subsection",
    "we show that this forthcoming observation will be sufficient to significantly constrain the inhomogeneous cosmological models .      before proceeding with further analysis , we asses the importance of analysing bao data using inhomogeneous , rather than flrw models .",
    "for example , when analysing the data in @xcite the redshifts of lrg galaxies were translated into comoving coordinates using the flat flrw model with @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 km s@xmath51 mpc@xmath51 .",

    "one can proceed with a similar analysis  employing the lt model instead of the flrw model . alternatively ,",
    "if it is assumed that the early universe ( before and up to the last scattering instant ) is well described by the flrw model then the cmb power spectrum can be parametrized by @xcite    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is a position of the first , second and third peak , and    @xmath103    where @xmath104 is a comoving distance to the last scattering surface and @xmath105 is a size of the sound horizon at the last scattering instant .",
