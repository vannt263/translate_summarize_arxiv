    "financial markets can be regarded as a non - equilibrium open system .",
    "understanding how they work remains a great challenge to researchers in finance , economics , and statistical physics .",
    "fluctuations in financial market prices are sometimes driven by endogenous forces and sometimes by exogenous forces .",
    "business news is a typical example of exogenous forces .",
    "casual observation indicates that stock prices respond to news articles reporting on new developments concerning companies circumstances .",
    "market reactions to news have been extensively studied by researchers in several different fields @xcite , with some researchers attempting to construct models that capture static and/or dynamic responses to endogenous and exogenous shocks @xcite .",
    "the starting point for neoclassical financial economists typically is what they refer to as the `` efficient market hypothesis , '' which implies that stock prices respond at the very moment that news is delivered to market participants .",
    "a number of empirical studies have attempted to identify such an immediate price response to news but have found little evidence supporting the efficient market hypothesis @xcite .",
    "investors seek to forecast what will happen in the near future , and buy and sell securities based on such forecasts . through this process , some newsworthy developments are factored into market prices before they occur , so that stock prices do not respond at all when they are reported @xcite .",
    "this means that it is important for researchers to distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated news and focus only on unanticipated news in detecting the immediate response to news . to do this",
    ", we need to measure the extent to which a news article is novel to market participants , which is the first issue we will discuss in this paper . on the other hand ,",
    "even if a particular piece of news is unanticipated , market responses differ depending on the importance of that piece of news to market participants .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that market reaction to news differs depending on how it is interpreted by market participants @xcite , on how it is reported by the media ( i.e. , whether it is reported in a pessimistic or an optimistic context ) @xcite , and on how many times the same news item is reported @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that transaction volumes tend to be greater for stocks with a larger number of searches on the internet @xcite .",
    "all of these pieces of evidence suggest that we need to distinguish news that attract a lot of attention from market participants and news that receive little attention , and focus on news attracting a lot of attention in assessing the market response to such news .",
    "this means that we need to measure the extent to which a news item attracts attention from market participants , which is the second issue we will discuss in this paper .",
    "our approach to measure the novelty and topicality of news is closely related to recent studies on the application of text mining techniques to the analysis of financial market activities .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that linguistic and statistical characteristics of news articles extracted using text mining techniques contain useful information to predict future stock prices and trading volumes @xcite .",
    "also , in the context of information filtering , several new methods for detecting and eliminating redundant text in blogs and on twitter have been developed and applied to the identification of the novelty content of social networking service ( sns ) texts @xcite .",
    "our paper is most closely related to studies by the thomson reuters corporation , which propose to measure the novelty of news by counting the number of linguistically similar news articles that are found in a particular time period in their news products @xcite .",
    "based on this method , it was shown that financial market activities respond more strongly to follow - up news than to initial news @xcite .",
    "another study closely related to ours is ref  @xcite , which attempts to measure the importance of a news article by counting the number of retweets of a tweet mentioning the article @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we measure the novelty of a news article by comparing it with other news articles reported before that article in terms of linguistic similarity : the article is regarded as novel if there was no linguistically similar news article before it .",
    "this approach is almost the same as that taken in previous studies . on the other hand",
    ", we say a news item attracts a lot of attention and thus is highly topical if it is simultaneously reported by multiple news agencies and read by many investors who acquire news from those agencies .",
    "the topicality measure for a news article is obtained by counting the number of news articles which have a similar content to the original news article but are delivered by other news agencies .",
    "this measure is similar to the measure proposed by ref  @xcite but differs from it in that our measure is able to capture the extent to which a news article is topical immediately after it is delivered , while the measure proposed by ref  @xcite does not work that quickly because the number of retweets of a tweet mentioning the article increases only gradually . to check the performance of the indicators ,",
    "we empirically examine how they are correlated with intraday financial market indicators such as the number of transactions and price volatility .",
    "specifically , we use a dataset consisting of over 90 million business news articles reported in english and a dataset consisting of minute - by - minute stock prices on the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) and the nasdaq stock market from 2003 to 2014 , and show that stock prices and transaction volumes exhibited a significant response to a news article when it is novel and topical .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first provide a detailed description of our dataset containing over 90 million english - language business news articles , and show that breaking news have much more impact on stock prices and transaction volume than other news .",
    "next , we examine the statistical laws regarding linguistic similarity among news articles , and propose a measure for the novelty of a news article as well as a measure for the topicality of an article .",
    "we then examine how these indicators are correlated with intraday financial market indicators .",
    "the thomson reuters corporation ( rtrs ) and the dow jones & company inc .",
    "( dj ) deliver news to market participants around the world within fractions of a second through electronic systems @xcite .",
    "news items published by over 300 third parties are displayed on rtrs s electronic trading platform . in this paper",
    ", we use only english - language news articles published by rtrs , the business wire news service ( bsw ) , the canada newswire news service ( cnw ) , marketwire ( mkw ) , the pr newswire news service ( prn ) , and market news publishing inc .",
    "( vmn ) on rtrs s platform as well as all of the english - language news articles by dj from 2003 to 2014 .",
    "the total number of news articles exceeds 90 million .",
    "journalists include keywords in their articles on rtrs s platform .",
    "for example , news articles for general motors company , llc have a keyword , gm.n , where .n means the new york stock exchange ( nyse ) .",
    "there are three types of news events on rtrs s platform .",
    "alert articles , which provide a one - line summary of breaking news , are displayed in red .",
    "headline articles provide a one - line summary of non - breaking news .",
    "an alert and a headline are up to 80 - 100 characters long .",
    "a story shows a complete news article .",
    "the percentages of alerts and headlines in our dataset are about 12% and 42% , respectively . on the other hand ,",
    "dj s news also has keywords like gm . in this paper",

    "we observed that the stock market strongly responds to the alerts that were displayed on rtrs s electronic trading platform . on the other hand",
    ", none of the stocks greatly responded to the headlines through which most news articles are reported .",
    "these results suggest that we need to measure the importance of news to predict market responses to it . in this paper",
    ", we focused on an indicator to measure the degree to which a particular news article is novel , as well as an indicator to measure the degree to which a particular news article acquires attention from investors .",
    "the novelty measure is obtained by comparing a news article with other news articles reported before that article in terms of linguistic similarity . on the other hand ,",
    "we say a news article attracts a lot of attention and thus is highly topical if it is simultaneously reported by other news agencies and read by many investors who acquire news from those agencies .",
    "the topicality measure for a news article is obtained by counting the number of news articles which have similar content to the original news article but are delivered by other news agencies . in order to check whether novel or topical news articles are caught by these indicators",
    ", we observed that the novelty of follow - up news is lower than that of initial news and confirmed that the topicality of alert exceeds headline .",
    "we found the characteristics of intraday market reactions to both novel and topical news .",
    "for a news article with high novelty , market activities ( i.e. , number of transactions , volume , volatility ) sharply increased just after the news article was reported . on the other hand , for a news article with low novelty , market activities",
    "have already increased based on past similar news before the news article was reported .",
    "the increase of market activities based on news is proportional to its topicality .    by these results",
    ", we can empirically relate price movements to particular news to find convincing supportive evidence for efficient market hypothesis .",
