    "many luminous accreting sources have prominent spectral components which appear approximately blackbody .",
    "if the accretor is a black hole it is natural to assume that the dimensions of the emitting surface are comparable to the schwarzschild radius , as this is the region where most of the gravitational potential energy is released .",
    "however the result of this procedure is not necessarily compatible with the eddington limit on the source luminosity , derived from the requirement that the radiation pressure should not drive the accreting matter away .",
    "examples of this for quasars have appeared in the literature ( puchnarewicz , 1994 ; molthagen , bade and wendker 1998 ; puchnarewicz 1998 ) .",
    "here we investigate the question systematically , and show that various classes of accreting black holes do not straightforwardly correspond to sub ",
    "eddington blackbodies . in general the resolution of",
    "this difficulty appears to require super  eddington or anisotropic emission .",
    "the luminosity and effective temperature of an optically thick emission region of typical size @xmath5 near a black hole are related by @xmath6 where the factor @xmath7 allows for deviations from isotropy and spherical symmetry in both source geometry and emission pattern .",
    "we write @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the schwarzschild radius , so that @xmath10 we can also express @xmath11 in terms of the eddington value @xmath12 , as @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "if the emission is anisotropic we must be careful to distinguish between the true luminosity @xmath11 and the ` spherical ' value @xmath1 assigned by a distant observer . as the translation from observed flux to luminosity generally assumes isotropic emission",
    "these are related by @xmath15 here @xmath16 if ( as expected in a flux  limited sample ) the observer lies within the ` beam ' of the source ( note that ` beaming ' here merely means ` anisotropic ' , and does _ not _ necessarily imply relativistic beaming ) . eliminating @xmath0 between ( [ bbm ] , [ edd ] ) and using the definition of @xmath1 we get @xmath17 and thus @xmath18 where @xmath19 is @xmath2 in units of 100ev .",
    "hence any object which violates the limit @xmath20 must have @xmath21 , i.e. must either be super  eddington ( @xmath22 ) , or emit from a region much smaller than the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath23 ) , or emit anisotropically ( @xmath24 ) . in the latter case , the luminosity @xmath11 will be _ less _",
    "( by a factor up to @xmath25 ) than estimated at infinity by assuming isotropic emission . given a choice of @xmath26 we get a mass estimate from ( [ m1 ] ) .",
    "a simple interpretation of the limit ( [ lim2 ] ) is that it ensures that the lower mass bound given by respecting the eddington luminosity ( cf eq .",
    "[ edd ] ) is compatible with the upper bound ( cf eq .",
    "[ m1 ] ) implied by the blackbody temperature , assuming isotropic emission from a region of size comparable with the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "we can generalise this result to the case where the blackbody emission is not the only luminosity component detected , i.e. , where ( [ bb ] ) is replaced by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is again a ` beaming ' factor reflecting the difference between the real luminosity @xmath30 and the value @xmath31 calculated by a distant observer assuming isotropic emission .",
    "for example , @xmath30 might be the power ",
    "law continuum frequently observed . then using @xmath32 and ( [ edd ] ) as before we get @xmath33 since @xmath34 we have @xmath35 and maximizing the rhs of ( [ dlim ] ) as @xmath11 varies implies @xmath36 hence if ( [ lim2 ] ) is violated , where @xmath1 is now interpreted as the total luminosity , not that of the blackbody component alone , we can draw the same conclusions as before , i.e. that the whole source is either super  eddington , or the blackbody component comes from a region smaller than the schwarzschild radius or is emitted anisotropically .",
    "the main importance of this result is the implication that our conclusions above for the blackbody component alone ( and the corresponding mass ) are not affected by inaccuracies in subtracting a diluting non ",
    "blackbody component .",
    "the new feature is that these same conclusions must hold ( with the possible alternative of beaming of the diluting continuum , i.e. @xmath37 ) if the non  blackbody emission appears to violate the limit @xmath38 in principle this gives a formally tighter mass limit @xmath39 the main restriction on using these limits more widely is of course the difficulty of making accurate temperature determinations if the dilution is severe .",
    "the condition ( [ lim2 ] ) divides sub  eddington sources from those where more complex phenomena occur .",
    "sources respecting this limit can be sub  eddington ; sources above it are either super  eddington , or emit from a surface smaller than the black hole horizon , or emit anisotropically .",
    "1 shows the limit plotted for a range of luminosities and temperatures covering both stellar  mass and supermassive systems .      for stellar  mass systems it is convenient to rewrite ( [ lim1 ] , [ m1 ] ) ) as @xmath40 and @xmath41 these forms agree with the well  known facts that x  ray bursters ( @xmath42 erg s@xmath4 , @xmath43  kev ) radiate isotropically ( @xmath44 ) at close to the eddington limit ( @xmath45 ) and are neutron stars ( @xmath46 ) with mass @xmath47 .",
    "outbursting soft x ",
    "ray transients reach luminosities @xmath48  erg  s@xmath4 , but are generally ultrasoft , and so do not threaten the limit ( [ lim2 ] ) .",
    "they are therefore consistent with the eddington limit for black  hole masses @xmath49 .",
    "some of the ulx sources ( see below ) which appear to violate the limit may however be unrecognised transients .",
    "the ulxs are by definition a group of non  nuclear sources in nearby galaxies where the solar  mass eddington limit is apparently violated , i.e. @xmath50  erg  s@xmath51 ( e.g. makishima et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "we see from fig .  1 that the ulxs straddle the line @xmath52 , potentially allowing an interpretation as sub ",
    "eddington sources in some cases .",
    "however for @xmath43  kev the required black  hole mass exceeds @xmath53 ( cf eq .",
    "this led initially to claims that these objects had masses intermediate between stellar values and supermassive ones .",
    "however it is hard to reconcile this idea with the clear link with recent star formation shown by _",
    "observations of the antennae ( fabbiano , zezas & murray , 2001 ) which reveal @xmath54 ulxs .",
    "a more likely possibility is that most ( if not all ) ulxs involve beamed , and possibly transient , emission from a shortlived luminous phase of massive x  ray binary evolution ( king et al . ,",
    "2001 ) . in any case , several of these sources violate the limit ( [ lim1 ] ) as their temperatures are too high for the assigned ` intermediate ' masses ( cf eq . [ mgal ] ) .",
    "recognising this , makishima et al ( 2000 ) suggested that their accretion discs extended very close to the horizon of a maximally rotating kerr black hole ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "given the errors this may make all ulxs compatible with the @xmath56 constraint , although only marginally .      the soft x ",
    "ray excess in agn ( i.e. an excess of @xmath57  kev flux above an extrapolation of the @xmath58  kev continuum ) is believed to be the high energy tail of an accretion disc spectrum ( arnaud et al .",
    "1985 ; pounds et al . , 1987 ; turner & pounds 1989 ; masnou et al .",
    "1994 ) . a spectral turnover in soft x  rays that would fix an effective temperature for an accretion disc",
    "is rarely observed however , implying relatively cool discs .",
    "an upper limit on the disc temperature can be derived from the slope of the soft x ",
    "ray excess , and a lower limit from constraints provided by the uv continuum . using combined ipc and mpc data from _ einstein _ , urry et al .",
    "( 1989 ) fitted blackbodies of less than 10  ev to the soft x - ray components of their sample of agn . by combining their pg quasar soft x  ray sample with the uv results of zheng et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found that the overall uv  soft x ",
    "ray continuum of quasars peaked at around 1000   again corresponding to @xmath59  ev .",
    "the typical luminosities @xmath60 to @xmath61  erg  s@xmath4 show that the pg sample quasars are easily interpreted as sub  eddington ( @xmath62 ) , isotropic ( @xmath63 ) emitters with masses @xmath64 a few @xmath65 ( cf ( [ lim1 ] , [ m1 ] ) ; see also fig .",
    "1 ) .    agn with hotter discs must have lower luminosities to remain sub  eddington .",
    "re  j1034 + 396 is a rare agn that does have a measureable high - energy turnover in soft x - rays , with @xmath66  ev .",
    "its luminosity @xmath67 erg s@xmath4 is consistent with sub - eddington accretion , and a mass @xmath68 ( puchnarewicz et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this is consistent with an earlier claim by pounds , done & osborne ( 1995 ) that re  j1034 + 396 is a supermassive analogue of stellar  mass black holes in their high state .",
    "however , there are several examples of agn whose accretion disc temperature is as hot that in re  j1034 + 396 , but with much higher luminosities .",
    "the ultrasoft x - ray component in e1346 + 266 ( z=0.92 ) was confirmed by the _ rosat _",
    "pspc to have a rest - frame temperature of 120@xmath69  ev ( errors are a conservative 99  percent ; puchnarewicz , mason & cordova 1994 ) . with an intrinsic luminosity of @xmath70  erg  s@xmath4 ( assuming unbeamed , spherically symmetric emission )",
    ", this corresponds to more than 100 times the eddington limit .",
    "the three agn from puchnarewicz ( 1998 ) have rest - frame blackbody temperatures of @xmath71150  ev and luminosities between 2@xmath72  erg  s@xmath4 and 10@xmath73  erg  s@xmath4 ; the order of 10 times `` super - eddington '' ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . a further eight hot ( kt@xmath74100  ev ) ,",
    "high - luminosity ( @xmath75 erg s@xmath4 ) candidates have been identified as part of the _ einstein _ ultrasoft survey ( uss ; puchnarewicz et al .",
    "1992 ; crdova et al . 1992 ; thompson & crdova , 1994 ) , although further data would be required to confirm the soft spectra indicated by _",
    "there has been evidence to suggest that the velocities of the broad line regions ( blrs ) in agn may provide an alternative way of measuring the black hole mass ( see eg .",
    "laor 1998 ) .",
    "however , four of the six high - luminosity quasars discussed in puchnarewicz ( 1998 ) have slow blrs , which would seem to refute this relationship . a simple way of addressing this is to invoke anisotropy in the continuum emission , which would reduce the black hole mass and the broad line region velocity .",
    "however , this involves several naive assumptions about the relation between the black hole mass , accretion disc spectrum and the conditions , geometry and velocity of the blr .",
    "we caution that while supporting our hypothesis of anisotropy in ultrasoft quasars , this solution may not be as straightforward as it appears ; we postpone further discussion to future work .",
    "the more fundamental issue of apparently super - eddington emission from quasars remains , irrespective of the conditions in the blr .",
    "1 shows that the ultrasoft agn have luminosities @xmath1 a factor @xmath76 above the value of @xmath77 appropriate to their measured temperatures , while several ulx sources show a similar if smaller effect . before going",
    "further we should check if these results could be spurious .",
    "probably the most serious possible cause of error arises from the claimed blackbody temperatures",
    ". these might be systematically too high either because ( a ) the values of @xmath2 are wrongly fitted , or ( b ) the spectra are not blackbody at all , but for example the result of comptonization , or the effects of electron scattering in regions with low absorption opacity . errors of the right order ( factors @xmath78 ) appear unlikely ; and if the effect is a physical one we have to explain why it occurs only in a subset of agn .",
    "nevertheless this area merits further study .    if we accept the values of @xmath2 appearing in fig .  1",
    ", we should consider the possibility that the emission may come from a region of total area smaller than the schwarzschild radius @xmath79 , i.e. that @xmath80 .",
    "since most of the accretion energy is released in a region of order @xmath79 , this requires that it should be removed non  radiatively , and only converted to radiation in a much smaller region . the only way of ensuring this appears to involve magnetic fields .",
    "merloni & fabian ( 2001 ) have indeed suggested that magnetic reconnection in regions comparable with the local disc thickness @xmath81 may be the primary dissipation mechanism in accretion discs .",
    "however , they also require that these regions should be triggered at heights at least an order of magnitude larger than their size .",
    "since @xmath82 , heights @xmath83 are needed . in this picture , blackbody emission would result from reprocessing the primary emission from these ` lamppost ' regions on the disc surface .",
    "the reprocessing regions can not be smaller than the lamppost heights @xmath84 , implying @xmath85 in this model .",
    "similar considerations probably apply in other magnetic energy release pictures .    thus assuming that the values of @xmath2 in fig .",
    "1 are not grossly in error , and that the radiating regions of the sources are unlikely to be significantly smaller than their schwarzschild radii , we are left with the alternatives that the sources with @xmath86 are genuinely super  eddington , or radiate anisotropically .",
    "we note that either of these possibilities would probably remove the need for intermediate masses @xmath87 in even those ulxs which do not violate the limit @xmath86 .",
    "begelman ( 2002 ) has proposed a mechanism allowing thin accretion discs to radiate at up to ten times the eddington limit , while king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have suggested that most ulxs are anisotropic emitters .",
    "the common feature here is that presumably both types of source are supplied with mass at rates close to or above the eddington value @xmath88 . to zeroth order we would expect the resulting accretion geometry to be similar in the two cases despite the large difference in black hole mass .",
    "we therefore suggest that the ultrasoft agn are the supermassive analogues of the ulxs .",
