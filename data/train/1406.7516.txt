    "propagating fronts are building blocks of traveling wave ( tw ) activity in dissipative spatially extended systems . like excitation pulses , periodic pulse trains , spiral and scroll waves , they are examples of nonlinear waves and represent fascinating self - organized spatio - temporal patterns in nonequilibrium macroscopic systems .",
    "traveling waves have been observed in many physical @xcite , biological @xcite , and chemical systems @xcite .",
    "prominent examples of front propagation include catalytic oxidation of carbon monoxide ( co ) on platinum single crystal surfaces @xcite , arrays of coupled chemical reactors @xcite , and nematic liquid crystals @xcite .    often , the medium that supports front propagation exhibits a complex shape and/or its size is limited like in biological cells @xcite , nanoporous media @xcite , or zeolites @xcite . in such system",
    "the interaction of the reactants with the boundaries of the medium leads to non - intuitive confinement effects @xcite .",
    "for example , phase separation in porous materials results in layering , freezing , wetting and other novel phase transitions not found in the bulk system @xcite . in particular , chemical reactions @xcite as well as molecular diffusion @xcite depend strongly on the shape of the domain .",
    "recent studies on the fundamental problem of particle transport through micro - domains exhibiting obstacles and/or small openings showed that the shape of these confinements ( periodicity , size of the connecting openings ) regulates the dynamics of diffusing particles leading to transport properties which significantly differ from free brownian motion @xcite .    even in systems ranging from micro- to the macroscale",
    "there is a ongoing interest in studies of nonlinear wave propagation under spatially confined conditions .",
    "important issues investigated in this context are the dependence of front reflection on the geometry size in the catalytic co oxidation on platinum surfaces @xcite , reaction fronts in poiseuille @xcite or shear flows @xcite , three - dimensional ( @xmath4d ) traveling waves in the human heart @xcite , to name a few .",
    "some parts of the human heart tissue , especially at the ventricles , are thick enough to support not only spiral waves , but also @xmath4d vortex structures , for example scroll waves and scroll rings .",
    "hence , detailed knowledge about the interaction of these self - organized spatio - temporal patterns with boundaries @xcite might be important for the understanding of possible mechanisms responsible for atrial tachycardia .",
    "in particular , there is experimental evidence that spatial variations of the heart wall s thickness play a significant role in atrial fibrillation @xcite .    nowadays",

    ", we address the problem of traveling front ( tf ) propagation through a @xmath4d channel with periodically modulated cross - section .",
    "aiming at deriving an equation of motion for the front position in corrugated channels , we apply asymptotic perturbation analysis in a geometric parameter @xcite and projection techniques @xcite to the problem .",
    "our goal is to analyze how spatial variations of the channel s cross - section affect front propagation and , in particular , to determine the dependence of the propagation velocity on the characteristic length scales in the system .",

    "the spatial dependent no - flux boundary conditions on the reactants translate into a one - dimensional reaction - diffusion system with an effective diffusion coefficient @xmath177 as it is demonstrated by the excellent agreement with simulation results .",
    "thereby , the influence of the spatial confinement on the microscopic dynamics is hidden in the value of @xmath177 and luthers law is recovered .    altogether , over a large range of spatial periods and bottleneck values ,",
    "the analytical result for the averaged propagation velocity in the corrugated channel ( including propagation failure ) agrees remarkably well with numerical results obtained in fem simulations .",
    "since the applicability of our perturbation analysis is based on a small channel s cross - section changing rate , @xmath150 , deviations from the analytical predictions are expected to grow for geometries with short - scale spatial modulations and narrow openings",
    ". our results might be interesting for control purposes : in this case , a given protocol of movement for a traveling wave , @xmath94 , is realized by a space - dependent cross - section to be derived solving the integral equation @xmath29   for the unknown @xmath179 , compare @xcite . for periodically varying cross - sections ,",
    "@xmath196 , accessible control parameters include the spatial period , the modulation amplitude , and the bottleneck width .",
