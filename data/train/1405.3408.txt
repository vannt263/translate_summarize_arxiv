    "symbiotic stars are believed to be wide binary systems consisting of a hot component , usually a white dwarf , and a mass losing giant ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . because of the size of the giant component , their orbital periods range from a few hundred days to several decades ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "symbiotic stars exhibit prominent emission lines indicative of a wide range of ionization including [ sii ] and o  vi .",
    "some fraction of the slow stellar wind from the giant component is accreted to the hot component , which leads to various activities including occasional eruptions and strong emission lines ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "performed _ smoothed particle hydrodynamical _",
    "computations for binary systems of a mass losing giant and a white dwarf to show that an accretion disk may be formed through accretion of the stellar wind .",
    "however , it is still an unresolved issue whether an accretion disk is formed in general in symbiotic stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "symbiotic stars are classified into s type and d type , where the latter exhibit an ir excess indicating the existence of a warm dust component surrounding the binary system .",
    "it appears that d - type symbiotic stars possess multiple dust shells with temperatures of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( @xcite ) .",
    "many symbiotic stars are also x - ray emitters exhibiting a large range of hardness .",
    "@xcite classified x - ray emitting symbiotic stars into types @xmath8 and @xmath9 depending on the hardness with the @xmath10 type being supersoft x - ray sources and the @xmath9 type being highly absorbed hard x - ray emitters .",
    "they discussed many astrophysical processes including thermonuclear shell burning , wind collision and boundary layer in the accretion disk .    in symbiotic stars",
    "unique and useful spectroscopic diagnostics are provided from raman scattering by atomic hydrogen . in this scattering process",
    ", a far uv photon blueward of ly@xmath10 is incident upon a hydrogen atom in the ground state .",
    "subsequently the hydrogen atom de - excites into @xmath11 state re - emitting an optical raman - scattered photon .",
    "the first identification of raman scattering in symbiotic stars was made by @xcite , who proposed that the broad emission features at 6825   and 7088   usually observed in many symbiotic stars are raman scattered o  vi@xmath2 1032 and o  vi@xmath2 1038 .",
    "the operation of raman scattering requires the coexistence of a highly thick h  i region and a strong far uv emission region , which is ideally met in symbiotic stars .",
    "recently raman scattered o  vi 1032 and 1038 features were found in the b[e ] star lha 115-s 18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "raman spectroscopy is very important in probing the mass loss and mass transfer processes in symbiotic stars ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) . adopting an emission region that is in a keplerian motion around the hot component",
    ", @xcite successfully fitted the double peaked profiles of the raman scattered o  vi@xmath21032 of the symbiotic stars hm sge and v1016 cygni .",
    "the representative keplerian velocity scale @xmath12 of the emission regions in these two symbiotic stars implies that the major o  vi emission region is located roughly within one astronomical unit from the hot component .",
    "it should be also noted that a double peak profile in raman scattered o  vi can be produced from purely geometric effects , where the scattering region coincides with the slowly expanding stellar wind around the giant ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite )",
    ". the mass loss rate of the cool component of v1016  cyg has been deduced from a photoionization model calculation combined with the measurement of the center shift of raman scattered he  ii by @xcite .",
    "additional raman scattered features were found and proposed by @xcite , who discussed the plausibility of raman scattering for various far uv emission lines including he  ii and c  iii . in particular , he reported the detection of the raman scattered he  ii features blueward of h@xmath13 and h@xmath14 in the symbiotic star rr telescopii .",
    "these features are also found in the symbiotic stars hm  sge and v1016  cyg ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in a be - like isoelectronic sequence , ne  vii is a very highly ionized species with the ionization potential of 207.271 ev ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "because of this high ionization potential , ne  vii lines are reported only in extremely hot stellar objects and active galactic nuclei .",
    "@xcite found ne  vii@xmath2973 absorption lines in the spectra of pg  1159 stars obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse)_. @xcite proposed the existence of ne  vii@xmath2973 in the fuse spectrum of the symbiotic star ag draconis . in the",
    "seyfert 1 galaxy ngc  5548 @xcite identified ne  vii / ne  viii blend at 88    in the extreme uv spectrum .",
    "v1016  cyg is a d type symbiotic star with the cool component being a mira type variable .",
    "it is also a symbiotic nova that underwent a nova - like outburst in 1964 ( @xcite ) . according to the investigation of @xcite , d type symbiotic novae including hm  sge , rr  tel and v1016  cyg form the subgroup of symbiotic stars with the hot components characterized by the highest temperature and luminosity .",
    "v1016  cyg being of higher temperature than ag dra , this leads to an interesting possibility that v1016  cyg may show the emission line ne  vii@xmath2973 .    in this paper , we present the high resolution spectra of v1016  cyg , in which a broad emission feature at 4881   is found redward of h@xmath13 .",

    "the emission line h@xmath13 is saturated in order to allow a close investigation of the weak features around h@xmath13 .",

    "obtained in 2003 and 2005 , which is very broad and formed in the blue wing part of h@xmath13 .",
    "because of energy conservation , the wavelength @xmath18 of the raman scattered radiation in vacuum is related to that of the far uv incident radiation @xmath19 by the equation @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the line center wavelength of hydrogen ly@xmath10 . with the refractive index of air @xmath3",
    ", the observed wavelength will be reduced to @xmath22 in particular , the incident wavelength @xmath23 for he  ii@xmath2972 gives rise to the raman scattered he  ii at @xmath24 ( @xcite ) , which yields the observed wavelength of @xmath25 .    in fig  [ boes_fig1 ] , the broad raman scattered he  ii feature has the observed line center at @xmath26 , which is blueshifted from @xmath27 by @xmath28 from the expected center wavelength . on the other hand , in fig .",
    "[ boes_fig2 ] , we find that @xmath29 . this deviation can be explained that the he  ii emission region is receding from the neutral h  i region",
    ". more detailed investigation on the kinematics of the emission region is described in the subsequent section .",
    "however , line center shift can also occur due to the varying raman conversion rate dependent on the wavelength ( @xcite ) , which necessitates monte carlo simulations for more accurate determination of the kinematics of the he  ii emission region relative to the h  i region .",
    "( [ raman_length ] ) also leads to the following relation @xmath30 which results in raman scattered features with a significantly broadened profile .",

    "because of the saturation of h@xmath13 , we use another spectrum obtained on the same night with an exposure time of 300 seconds . in fig .",
    "[ gas_fit1 ] , we show the result , which is also summarized in table  1 .",
    "in a similar way , the raman scattered he  ii@xmath2972 and the broad feature at 4883 are fitted for the spectrum with exposure time of 7200 seconds , of which the result is shown in fig .",

    "this line center value @xmath43 is shorter than the observed center wavelength @xmath44 by a small amount of @xmath45 in the 2003 spectrum . in the case of the 2005 spectrum ,",
    "the corresponding values are @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "this feature is quite broad , which is consistent with the primary characteristic of a raman scattered feature .",

    "in the 2005 spectrum it is redshifted by an amount exceeding 2  . because both he  ii and ne  vii are highly ionized species , it is quite plausible that their emission regions almost coincide sharing a similar kinematics with respect to the neutral region .",
    "because the profiles of raman scattered features are dominantly affected by a relative motion between the far uv emission source and the h  i region and little influenced by the observer s sightline , the difference in the spectra of 2003 and 2005 implies that there was a significant change in the far uv emission region and/or in the h  i region of v1016  cyg .
