    "its ground - state lifetime is governed by the @xmath2 s - wave scattering lengths @xmath9 , with total isospin @xmath10  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the @xmath13 momentum in the atom rest frame , @xmath14 is the fine - structure constant , and @xmath15 is a correction of order @xmath14 due to qed and qcd @xcite which ensures a 1% accuracy of equation ( [ eq : gasser ] ) . the value of @xmath16 and @xmath17 can be rigorously calculated in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt )  @xcite , predicting @xmath18 and the @xmath4 lifetime @xmath19 s  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath20 provides an important test of the theory since @xmath21 is sensitive to the quark condensate defining the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in qcd  @xcite .",
    "the method reported in this article implies observation of the pionium state through its ionization into two pions .",
    "given its large bohr radius , this is directly sensitive to @xmath2 scattering at threshold , @xmath22 , and thus delivers a precision test of the theory without requiring threshold extrapolation , as for semileptonic @xmath23 decays  @xcite , or substantial theoretical input as for @xmath24 decays  @xcite .",

    "characteristic atomic pion pairs emerge @xcite .",
    "these have a very low @xmath25 ( @xmath28  mev/@xmath29 ) and very small opening angle in the laboratory frame ( @xmath28  mrad ) . a high - resolution magnetic spectrometer ( @xmath30 ) is used @xcite to split the pairs and measure their relative momentum with sufficient precision to detect the pionium signal .",
    "this signal lays above a continuum background from free ( unbound ) coulomb pairs produced in semi - inclusive proton - nucleus interactions .",
    "other background sources are non - coulomb pairs where one or both pions originate from a long - lived source ( @xmath31 ) and accidental coincidences from different proton - nucleus interactions .",

    "we now present final results from the analysis of  @xmath33 events recorded from 2001 to 2003 .",
    "compared to the results in @xcite , this analysis has reduced systematic errors and improved track reconstruction , mostly due to the use of the gem - msgc detector  @xcite information , which leads to a larger signal yield .",

    "low relative - momentum prompt and accidental @xmath0 pairs are produced at the target and selected by the multi - level trigger when their time difference , recorded by the two spectrometer arms , is @xmath35 ns . a suitable choice of the target material and thickness provides the appropriate balance between the @xmath4 breakup and annihilation yields , with reduced multiple - scattering  @xcite . for a thin ni target , of order @xmath36 , the relative c.m .",
