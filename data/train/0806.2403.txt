    "the jacobian is not diagonalisable .",
    "then we may assume that @xmath4 as this form can be achieved by a linear area - preserving change of variables .",

    "this means that two leading coefficients in a normal form of @xmath0 do not vanish : one of them is a leading non - linear term of @xmath5 and the second one guarantees that @xmath0 is a  generic unfolding \" of  @xmath5 .",

    "we will see that the bifurcation can be described by an integrable normal form .",

    "when @xmath13 changes sign an equilibrium of @xmath15 bifurcates following the scenario sketched in figure  [ fig : h6bif ] . for @xmath16 , separatrices of the saddle point form a loop around the elliptic fixed point .    under these assumptions",

    "one of the fixed points is elliptic ( centre ) and another one is hyperbolic ( saddle ) .",
    "for this reason the bifurcation is sometimes called a hamiltonian saddle - centre bifurcation .",
    "the bifurcation of the map is very similar to the bifurcation of the leading order normal form ( [ eq : h6non ] ) . unlike the normal form",

    "an application of @xmath0 increases the parameter @xmath30 by @xmath31 .",
    "therefore the conditions @xmath32 imply that @xmath33 represents the unstable separatrix and @xmath34 represents the stable one .",
    "it is easy to see that these conditions do not defined the functions @xmath29 uniquely .",
    "the most convenient parameterization is obtained using analytic linearizations of restrictions of @xmath0 onto @xmath35 and @xmath36 respectively .",
    "these parametrisations can be represented in the form @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 are analytic at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this choice reduces the freedom in @xmath29 to a translation @xmath42 .",

    "numerical evaluation of @xmath56 for a given @xmath5 is a relatively easy task .",
    "the difficulty of this theorem is due to the exponential smallness of the separatrices splitting which is to be detected on the background of much larger effects .",
    "the proof consists of the following main steps :    1 .",
    "we show that @xmath0 can be formally represented as a time - one map of a hamiltonian flow and provide a normal form theory for the flow .",
    "we develop a general theory of close - to - identity maps which provides sufficient condition for the existence of saddle points and their separatrices .",
    "moreover , we prove that the separatrices of the map can be quite accurately approximated by separatrices of a flow which approximately interpolates the map .",
    "we show that in the complexified time domain the separatrix of the interpolating flow is close to the separatrix of @xmath0 in a set which has a non - empty intersection with a @xmath24-neighbourhood of  @xmath57 .",
    "we show that in the latter region an approximation based on the separatrices of the parabolic fixed point of @xmath5 provides an even more accurate approximation .",
    "this approximation distinguishes between the stable and unstable separatrices of @xmath0 .",
    "we show that flow - box time coordinates can be introduced .",
