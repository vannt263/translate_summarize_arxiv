    "in sensitivity and stability analysis of parameterized optimization and equilibrium problems via the tools of modern variation analysis one often needs to compute the limiting ( mordukhovich ) normal cone to the graph of the mapping @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for the regular ( frchet ) normal cone to a closed ( not necessarily convex ) constraint set @xmath3 .",
    "this research started in the nineties with the paper @xcite , where the authors obtained an exact formula for the above mentioned limiting normal cone in the case when @xmath3 is a convex polyhedron .",
    "the special case of @xmath3 being the nonnegative orthant paved then the way to efficient @xmath4-stationarity conditions for the so - called mathematical programs with complementarity constraints ( mpccs ) , cf .",
    "later , this formula has been adapted to the frequently arising case when the polyhedron @xmath5 is given by affine inequalities @xcite .",
    "meanwhile the researchers started to attack a more difficult case , when @xmath5 is the pre - image of a closed set @xmath6 in a @xmath0-mapping @xmath7 , arising typically in nonlinear or conic programming .",
    "it turned ont that one can again obtain an exact formula provided @xmath8 is a @xmath0-reducible set ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.135 ) ) and the reference point is nondegenerate with respect to @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 4.70 ) ) . in the case of nonlinear programming ( nlp ) constraints",
    "this amounts to the standard linear independence constraint qualification ( licq ) .",
    "these results can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the situation , unfortunately , becomes substantially more difficult , provided the nondegeneracy ( or licq ) condition is relaxed .",
    "such a situation has been investigated in the case of strongly amenable @xmath3 in @xcite and @xcite and in the case of nlp constraints under mangasarian - fromovitz constraint qualification ( mfcq ) in @xcite . in both cases one needs to impose still another so - called 2nd - order qualification condition ( socq ) to obtain at least an upper estimate of the desired limiting normal cone which is quite often not very tight . by combining results from @xcite and",
    "@xcite one can further show that in the nlp case the validity of socq is implied by the constant rank constraint qualification ( crcq ) so that one needs in fact both mfcq ( or its suitable relaxation ) and crcq @xcite .",
    "the result of @xcite has been further developed in @xcite , where under a strengthened socq exact formula has been obtained provided the indicatory function of @xmath8 is ( convex ) piecewise linear .    in all",
    "above mentioned works the authors employ essentially the generalized differential calculus of b. mordukhovich as it is presented in @xcite and @xcite . in recent years , however , this calculus has been enriched by h. gfrerer , who introduced , among other things , a directional variant of the limiting normal cone .",
    "this notion has turned out to be very useful in fine analysis of constraint and variational systems , cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to compute the limiting normal cone to the graph of @xmath1 with @xmath3 given by nlp constraints under a _ different set of assumptions _ compared with the above quoted literature . in particular , as in @xcite , mfcq is replaced by the metric subregularity of the perturbation mapping at the reference point combined with a uniform metric regularity of this multifunction on a neighborhood , with the reference point excluded .",
    "this condition is clearly weaker ( less restrictive ) than mfcq .",
    "furthermore , as another ingredient we employ the notion of 2-regularity , introduced in a slightly different context by avakov @xcite .",
    "this notion enables us to introduce a new cq called 2-licq which ensures an amenable directional behavior of active constraints . on the basis of these two conditions",
    "we then compute the directional limiting normal cones ( or their upper estimates ) to the graph of @xmath2 , which eventually leads to the desired exact formula for the limiting normal cone to the graph of @xmath2 at the given reference pair .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we collect the needed notions from variational analysis and some essential statements from the literature which are extensively used throughout the whole paper .",
    "furthermore , this section contains a motivating example showing that under mere mfcq the desired object can not be generally computed via first and second derivatives of the problem functions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to 2-licq .",
    "apart from the definitions one finds there several auxiliary statements needed in the further development .",
    "the main results are then collected in section 4 , whereas section 5 deals with an application of these results to testing of the aubin property of solution maps to parameterized equilibrium problems , when @xmath3 arises as a constraint set .",

    ", @xmath11 denotes its negative polar cone , @xmath12 stands for the graph of a mapping @xmath13 and @xmath14 signifies the closed unit ball .",

    "@xmath95 : from ( [ eq-5.7 ] ) we infer the existence of multipliers @xmath830 such that @xmath831 by virtue of the assumed metric regularity of @xmath92 in the vicinity of @xmath91 this sequence is bounded , because otherwise the formula for the modulus of metric regularity in ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xmath834 and @xmath835 infinitely many times : then the result follows immediately from the closedness of @xmath836 .",
    "we illustrate now the preceding stability criteria by means of two ges with the constraint sets analyzed in examples [ exampleincl ] and [ exampleeq ] .",
    "[ old ] consider the ge ( [ eq-5.1 ] ) with @xmath837 and @xmath838 .",
    "this ge represents stationarity conditions of the nonlinear program @xmath839 first let us take @xmath5 from example [ exampleeq ] and put @xmath840 , @xmath770 . an application of proposition [ propaubprop ] leads to the condition @xmath841 which is clearly fulfilled .",
    "hence , the respective solution map @xmath805 has the aubin property around @xmath808 .",
    "now let us consider the same situation with @xmath5 from example [ exampleincl ] .",

    "clearly , ( [ eq-81 ] ) amounts to @xmath844 this implication is , however , clearly violated e.g. by the vector @xmath845 . since by virtue of @xmath843 is a lower estimate of @xmath179 , it follows that the respective solution map does not possess the aubin property around @xmath808 .",

    "there is a nonzero @xmath855 such that @xmath856 .",
