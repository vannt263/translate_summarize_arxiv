    "the physical structures and chemical compositions of gas , dust , and ice in protoplanetary disks control the formation process of planets and the composition of their cores and atmospheres . the alma long baseline campaign has detected gaps and rings in dust continuum emission from the circumstellar disk around a very young star ( @xmath6myrs ) , hl tau @xcite .",

    "the visibility data was reduced for each spw separately , and the continuum visibilities were extracted by averaging the line - free channels in all spws .",
    "the corrected visibilities were imaged using the clean algorithm with briggs weighting with a robust parameter of 0 after calibration of the bandpass , gain in amplitude and phase , and absolute flux scaling , and then flagging for aberrant data .",
    "in addition to the usual clean imaging , we performed self - calibration of the continuum emission to improve the sensitivity and image quality .",
    "the obtained solution table of the self - calibration for the continuum emission was applied to the visibilities of the lines .",

    "5 ) as the gas temperature , @xmath70 . also",
    ", we adopt a dust temperature of @xmath42 and the dust optical depth , @xmath36 , is derived from the dust continuum observations ( fig .",
    "we note that in the analysis we simply assume that the gas temperature is uniform in the vertical direction , and the gas temperature of the c@xmath3o line emitting region is the same as that of the @xmath2co line emitting region , although it could be lower in reality .",
    "in addition , c@xmath3o could be depleted due to the effect of isotopologue - dependent photodissociation , and @xmath74 is possibly higher than 440 @xcite .",
    "the co column density will be underestimated due to these effects .",

    "h@xmath17 gas - to - dust ratio is also marked for a reference by simply assuming the abundance ratio of co to h@xmath17 of @xmath75 .",
    "all data are smoothed to a beam size of 0.45@xmath220.45 . ]      using the obtained co column density and dust surface density ( figs .",
    "4d and 2b ) , we derive the co gas - to - dust surface density ratio ( fig .",
    "if we convert it to the h@xmath17 surface density , assuming an abundance ratio of co to h@xmath17 of @xmath75 @xcite , the estimated h@xmath17 gas mass is orders of magnitude lower than that predicted from the observations of the hd line emission by the herschel space observatory @xcite .",
    "the resulting h@xmath17 gas - to - dust surface density ratio ( @xmath6 ) is about two orders of magnitude lower than the typical interstellar value of @xmath0100 , which suggests strong co depletion throughout the disk down to @xmath76au .    the co gas - to - dust surface density ratio increases beyond a radius of @xmath77au since the dust surface density drops dramatically in this region",
    ". it could be due to drift of pebbles from the outer disk toward the central star ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gap and ring resemble those in the hl tau system , recently found by the alma long baseline campaign @xcite .",
    "our result shows that gaps and rings in the ( sub)millimeter dust continuum can exist , not only in relatively young disks ( @xmath78myrs ) but also in relatively old disks ( @xmath79myrs ) .",
    "one possible mechanism to open a gap is the gravitational interaction between a planet and the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such an interaction may also produce the spiral density waves recently found in optical and near - infrared scattered light imaging of dust grains in protoplanetary disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "according to recent theoretical analyses of gap structure around a planet @xcite , the depth and width of the gap are controlled by the planetary mass , the turbulent viscosity and the gas temperature .",
    "the shape of the gap is strongly influenced by angular momentum transfer via turbulent viscosity and/or instability caused by a steep pressure gradient at the edges of a gap .",
    "the observed gap has an apparent width and depth of @xmath80au and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "this is too shallow and too wide compared with that predicted by theory .",
    "however , the observations are limited to an angular resolution of @xmath1au , and the depth and width could be deeper and narrower in reality .",
    "for instance , if we assume that the gap depth times the gap width retains the value derived from the observations , it is possible for the gap to have a width and depth of @xmath816au and @xmath82 , which is similar to the gpi result @xcite .",
    "such a gap could be opened by a super - neptune - mass planet , depending on parameters of the disk , such as the turbulent viscosity @xcite .",
    "if the gap in the larger dust grains is deeper than that in the gas , the planet could be lighter than super - neptune mass .",
    "we note that a planet of even a few earth masses , although it can not open a gap in the gas , can open a gap in the dust distribution if a certain amount of pebble - sized particles , whose motion is not perfectly coupled to that of gas , are scattered by the planet and/or the spiral density waves excited by the planet @xcite .",
    "another possible mechanism to form a gap and an associated ring in dust continuum emission is the microscopic process of sintering of co ice on dust aggregates @xcite .",
    "the gaps and rings observed in the younger and more luminous hl tau system could be explained by the sintering of various molecular ices in the disk at their distinct snow line locations @xcite .",
    "although our observations indicate that the co depleted region is located down to @xmath76au in the tw hya system , model calculations of the temperature in the disk suggest the co snow line is located at @xmath83au .",
    "sintering is a process that renders an aggregate less sticky @xcite . just outside the co snow line where sintering occurs",
    ", large aggregates become easily destroyed into small fragments by collisions and their radial drift motion by the above - mentioned mechanism slows down .",
    "thus dust grains are stuck just outside the co snow line , and a bright ring and a dark lane inside the ring is formed in the dust continuum emission .",
    "if another sintering region is formed inside the dark lane by , for example , ch@xmath84 sintering , the region between the bright co and ch@xmath84 sintering regions would look like a gap . according to model calculations @xcite , the ch@xmath84 sintering region",
    "is located at @xmath76au in the tw hya disk .      from the co line observations , we find a very low column density of co compared with dust throughout the disk down to a radius of about 10au .",
    "this co depletion could indicate a general absence of h@xmath17 gas compared with dust .",
    "however , the herschel hd observations @xcite indicates that it is more likely that it is due to co freeze - out on grains with the possibility that subsequent grain surface reactions form larger molecules even inside the co snow line @xcite . the co column density derived from our observations , @xmath85@xmath86 , can be explained by detailed model calculations using a chemical network which includes freeze - out of molecules on grains and grain - surface reactions @xcite .",
    "the model calculations show the co depletion will proceed inside the co snow line due to the sink effect : conversion of co to less volatile species on grain surface . in the case of tw hya",
    ", it could occur on a timescale shorter than the disk lifetime , depending on the amount of small grains .",
    "see @xcite for more detailed discussions including the effect on other species .",
    "the co depletion spread over the disk is inconsistent with the prediction by the previous alma n@xmath17h@xmath18 observations that depletion would be localized beyond the co snow line @xcite .",
    "this could be because the n@xmath17h@xmath18 line emission traces the disk surface and not the co depleted region .",
    "5 shows the brightness temperature at the peak of the @xmath2co @xmath4 line obtained by our observations and the n@xmath17h@xmath18 @xmath19 line at 372.672ghz obtained by the alma archived data ( 2011.0.00340.s ) . since the @xmath2co line is optically thick , the brightness temperature at the peak of the line emission represents the gas temperature of the line emitting region .",
    "if lte is applicable , the n@xmath17h@xmath18 brightness temperature is higher than the gas temperature of the @xmath2co line emitting region at the disk radius of @xmath77au , and higher than the dust temperature near the midplane down to @xmath1au ( fig .  5 ) . if the n@xmath17h@xmath18 line is optically thin , the gas temperature of the line emitting region is higher than the brightness temperature . therefore , the n@xmath17h@xmath18 line should come from the surface layer of the disk .",
    "model calculations also predict that n@xmath17h@xmath18 exists in the disk surface for the model with ( sub)micron - sized grains , similar to radical species abundant in the disk surface , such as cn and c@xmath17h ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our results ( fig .  5 ) and the sma observations of c@xmath17h @xcite",
    "show that the radial intensity profiles of these species are similar .",
    "they have peaks around the disk radius of 40au beyond which the dust surface density drops .",
    "the result suggests that in order to trace the co depleted region , the c@xmath3o line may be more robust than the n@xmath17h@xmath18 line .    in the co depleted region complex organic molecules",
    "would be produced via grain surface reactions since hydrogen attachment to co is thought to produce methanol and more complex species ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "methyl cyanide , which has recently been detected from a protoplanetary disk for the first time by alma @xcite , could be formed through such grain surface reactions .",
