    "as first revealed by _ einstein _ observations , normal elliptical galaxies ,",
    "both isolated or in groups and clusters , can be powerful x - ray sources with 0.5 - 4.5 kev luminosities @xmath1 ranging from @xmath2 to @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 .",
    "this emission is associated with hot gaseous halos within the galaxies , containing @xmath5 ( see @xcite ) .    in order to explain this observational finding , a certain class of solutions designated cooling flow models",
    "have been proposed and extensively investigated ( e.g. , fabian , nulsen , & canizares 1984 ; sarazin & white 1987,1988 ; vedder , trester , & canizares 1988 ) . while these models have many attractive features , they are far from giving a totally satisfactory account of the x - ray properties of all elliptical galaxies , as most observed systems are much fainter in the x - rays than the models predict and have different radial profiles than expected .",
    "moreover , the cooling flow models do not solve the question of _ where _ the cool gas is deposited : over a hubble time an amount of material comparable to the mass of stars in the galactic core flows into the nucleus , but the expected distortions of the central optical surface brightness and velocity dispersion are not observed .",
    "one possible solution to part of the previous set of problems was proposed by dercole et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and cdpr , who showed that the heating from snia could be effective in maintaining low luminosity galaxies in a wind phase over an hubble time ( and so preventing the gas from accumulating in the centre ) . but",
    "the most massive galaxies ultimately experience a central cooling catastrophe , leading to a situation similar to a cooling flow . clearly",
    "a component of the explanation is missing and is possibly related to the fact ( e.g. , @xcite ) that many ( perhaps most ) early - type galaxies show a nuclear activity , and , according to the standard interpretation of the agn phenomenon , a massive bh is at its origin .",
    "so it is natural to investigate the accretion of a galactic gas inflow onto galaxies within which lurk massive central bhs ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "binney & tabor ( 1995 , bt ) explored this problem with the aid of spherically symmetric numerical simulations , assuming an homogeneous release of energy in the inner kpc of their galaxy models during the inflow phases .",
    "moreover , bt assumed that all the accretion luminosity was available for the gas heating , due to the interaction between a nuclear jet and the surrounding ism .    in the present paper",
    "we explore , by numerical integration of the fully non - stationary equations of hydrodynamics , the modifications on the results of cdpr , assuming the presence of a massive bh the galaxy centre with detailed allowance for the effects on the flow of the radiation emitted by the central bh . as will be shown ,",
    "the gas over the body of the galaxy is ( as noted by bt ) really optically thin , but nevertheless the effect of _ energy _ exchange between the nuclear _ radiation _ and the gas flow is dramatic .",
    "this effect was already known and extensively studied for accreting compact objects ( @xcite ; cowie , ostriker , & stark 1978 ) . in a successive paper ( @xcite , paper ii ) , a quantitative analysis of various aspects of the scenario summarized in this letter , together with an exaustive description of the input physics and its modelization ,",
    "will be given .",
    "all the results shown here refer to a model whose parameters are fixed following the line of cdpr .",
    "the stellar density profile is a king ( 1972 ) distribution , with total blue luminosity @xmath7 , central velocity dispersion @xmath8 km s@xmath4 , and core radius @xmath9 pc .",
    "the dark - matter halo is described by a quasi - isothermal density distribution , with @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the snia rate is the same as that in the king reference model of cdpr .",
    "the bolometric luminosity emitted by accretion onto the bh is @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the light velocity , and @xmath14 is the accretion efficiency , with @xmath15 . the spectral distribution of @xmath0 near the bh is assumed to be @xmath16 , where @xmath17=1mev . in the present model @xmath18 .",
    "the spherically symmetric hydrodynamical equations are integrated numerically using the eulerian up - wind scheme with time splitting and artifical viscosity as used in cdpr . in the energy equation",
    "the contribution of compton heating ( and cooling ) of the gas due to @xmath0 and to the recycling of the radiation produced by the gas heated by the bh activity are included .",
    "we allow also for the effect of the photoionization in both cooling and heating of cold gas as well as momentum exchange between photons and electrons . at each radius",
    "the radiation field is integrated , considering the gas differential absorption on @xmath19 and using for the electrons the klein - nishina cross - section . in this way",
    "the absorbed fraction of @xmath0 is computed self - consistently .    in fig .",
    "1b ( solid line ) the temporal evolution of the coronal x - ray luminosity @xmath1 of the gas in the 0.54.5 kev band is shown over an hubble time .",
    "the evolution up to the so - called _ cooling catastrophe _ ( @xmath20 gyr ) is analogous to that described in cdpr , but after this time the compton heating instability completely alters the flow evolution and its properties . at the cooling catastrophe",
    "negative infall velocities appear near the galaxy center , with @xmath21yr@xmath4 , and this accretion produces a strong , energetic feed - back producing a very high @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "the gas in the central regions of the galaxy is strongly heated to temperatures comparable with the compton temperature associated with @xmath19 ( @xmath22 k ) , and starts to expand , decreasing its density by more than two orders of magnitude , driving a shock wave outwards and producing a hot bubble of a few hundred parsecs in diameter .",
    "the net effect is , observationally , a large reduction of @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "1b ) , and , hydrodynamically , the interruption of the galactic inflow and the consequent shut - off of @xmath0 .",
    "then the radiative losses increase again , and , after a period of the order of the hot gas cooling time , the cycle repeats . in the model described here",
    "this time is of the order of @xmath23 gyr . in the case of very high accretion",
    "the shock wave can reach the galaxy edge , and expel gas from the galaxy . at higher time resolution",
    "each burst shows a very complex structure , that will be discussed in detail in paper ii : the temporal blow - up of the first burst shown in fig . 1",
    "is plotted in fig .",
    "2 , showing qso - like luminosities .",
    "an important characteristic of all computed models  of which a single representative is here discussed ",
    "is that the fraction of @xmath0 effectively absorbed by the gaseous halo is in the range @xmath24 , but _ the gas flows are found to be invariably unstable due to compton heating for all the explored efficiencies _ : in presence of a massive bh at the center of elliptical galaxies the possibility of a stationary cooling flow seems to be very remote .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the distribution of @xmath1 from 9 gyr to 15 gyr .",
    "the dashed histogram shows the model distribution of @xmath1 given in fig . 1 , and the solid line shows data for ( non - boxy ) early - type galaxies taken from fig.1 of cdpr .",
    "finally the dotted histogram is the distribution of @xmath1 for the same model , with the cooling flow assumption of @xmath25 .",
    "we see that the model with @xmath26 has a distribution , over time , of @xmath1 surprisingly similar to that of observed galaxies , but the cooling flow model ( as is well known ) produces far too much radiation . in fig .",
    "4 the x - ray surface brightness profile ( @xmath27 ) of the presented model is shown at two different epochs , before and during bursts ( vertical arrows in fig .",
    "2 ) . also shown",
    "is the cooling flow profile for the same galaxy at @xmath28 gyr .",
    "note how @xmath27 is characterized by a well defined core before a burst , alleviating the problem of the too cuspy @xmath27 that afflicts cooling flow models ( canizares , fabbiano , & trinchieri 1987 ) .",
    "certainly interesting is the fate of the transient cold shell surrounding the hot bubble ( especially in low-@xmath14 solutions ) during the flaring activity , when the central gas surface brightness is very low . due to rayleigh - taylor instability , the shell will break up , and perhaps cold fingers of gas should be observable inside the hot low density bubble , accreting on the central bh .",
    "so , the presence of the central heating source produces in a natural way a multiphase ism on galactic scales , while the same phenomenon may be harder to obtain ( balbus 1991 ) in the cooling flow scenario .",
    "5 shows the spectra in the preburst ( dotted ) and during burst ( solid ) phases , compared to the cooling flow ( dashed ) spectrum .",
    "the emitted spectrum is never as soft in this set of models as it is in cooling flow models , and , during bursts , occasionally it will have a very hard tail .",
    "in this letter we show how the presence of a massive central bh in early type galaxies is able to produce naturally both the observed x - ray underluminosity with respect to the pure cooling flow expectations , and the large observed scatter in @xmath1 at fixed @xmath29 . as can be seen from fig . 1",
    ", @xmath1  except in the very short period of bursts  is always lower than that of the corresponding inflow model with @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , the statistical distribution of observed data compared with the amount of time spent at each @xmath1 by the model here discussed , is eloquent ( fig .",
    "3 ) . finally , due to the strong feed - back on the gas flows of the radiation emitted by the accretion ,",
    "the total mass accumulated by the bh over 15 gyr is very low ( @xmath30 ) , to be compared with the @xmath31 of the correspondent @xmath25-model . the same model in pure cooling - flow ( without the initial snia driven wind - outflow phases )",
    "would have accumulated in its center @xmath32 of gas .    from an observational point of view , it is interesting to note that during the accretion phases the galaxy luminosity is dominated by @xmath0 ( with highest values at @xmath33 erg s@xmath4 ) , while during the quiescent bh phases the galaxy emission is due only to the diffuse hot gas @xmath1 . the total energy emitted by the accretion when @xmath34 is @xmath35 erg , while during the same phases",
    "the total energy emitted by the coronal gas is @xmath36 erg .",
    "the ratio between the total time spent by the galaxy when @xmath37 , and the total time spanned by the simulation is @xmath38 : very few galaxies should be caught in a agn - like phase even though most contain central bhs .",
    "thus , the compton heating instability could be an alternative possibility to that advocated by fabian & rees ( 1995 ) in order to explain why the nuclei of elliptical galaxies are not luminous sources of radiation as expected if they host a massive central bh .",
    "a clear prediction of this model is that some significant fraction of qsos should be embedded in high temperature , low surface brightness x - ray halos .    in other works to be reported in paper ii we varied the efficiency in the range @xmath39 and the galaxy luminosity in the range @xmath40 , with results very similar to those shown in figs . 2 - 5 .",
    "we are well aware that in the real accretion phenomenon a disk geometry for the infalling gas seems to be inescapable . then the accretion luminosity will be emitted preferentially along polar directions .",
    "it is clear that ( at least ) fully 2d hydrodynamical simulations are required for a better understanding of this problem , and to follow the development and the final fate of the gas instabilities .",
    "we are working in this direction , but expect that many of the quantitative features of the present work will be carried over to the more complicated calculations .",
