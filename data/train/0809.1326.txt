    "the history of our universe is largely unknown between the surface of last scattering ( @xmath0 ) down to a redshift of about 6 . because of the dearth of radiating sources and the fact that we know very little about this epoch",
    ", it is often referred to as the `` dark ages '' .",
    "theoretical models suggest that around redshifts 10  20 , the first sources of radiation appeared that subsequently reionized the universe .",
    "two different experiments provide the bounds for this epoch of reionization ( eor ) ; the high polarization component at large spatial scales of the temperature - electric field ( te ) cross - polarization mode of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) providing the upper limit for the redshift at @xmath1 @xcite and the rapid increase in the lyman-@xmath2 optical depth towards redshift 6 , observed in the spectrum of high redshift quasars @xcite , the lower limit . although the redshifted 21 cm hyperfine transition of hydrogen was proposed as a probe to study this epoch decades ago @xcite , the technological challenges to make these observations possible are only now being realised . in the meantime ,",
    "theoretical understanding of the eor has improved greatly @xcite . over the past few years",
    "there have been considerable efforts in simulating the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization .",
    "almost all of the methods employed in simulating the 21 cm involve computer intensive full 3-d radiative transfer calculations @xcite .",
    "theories predict that the process of reionization is complex and sensitively dependent on many not - so - well - known parameters .",
    "although stars may be the most favoured of reionization sources , the role of mini - quasars ( miniqsos ) , with the central black hole mass less than a few million solar masses , are debated @xcite .",
    "even if the nature of the sources of radiation would be relatively well constrained , there are a number of `` tunable '' parameters like the photon escape fraction , masses of these first sources , and so on , that are not well constrained .    in a couple of years",
    ", next generation radio telescopes like lofar and mwa will be tuned to detect the 21 cm radiation from the eor .",
    "although the designs of these telescopes are unprecedented , the prospects for successfully detecting and mapping neutral hydrogen at the eor critically depends on our understanding of the behaviour and response of the instrument , the effect of diffuse polarized galactic & extra - galactic emission , point source contamination , ionospheric scintillations , radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and , not least , the characteristics of the desired signal . a good knowhow of the above phenomena would enable us to develop advanced signal processing / extraction algorithms , that can be efficiently and reliably implemented to extract the signal . in order to test and confirm the stability and reliability of these algorithms , it is imperative that we simulate , along with all the effects mentioned above , a large range of reionization scenarios .",
    "[ fig : bigpic ] shows the basic building blocks of the simulation pipeline being built for the lofar - eor experiment .",
    "this paper basically constitutes the first block , i.e. , simulation of the cosmological 21 cm eor signal .",
    "this then passes through a sequence of blocks like the foreground simulation @xcite , instrument response and extraction ( lambropoulous et al . , _ in prep _ ) .",
    "the extracted signal is then compared with the original signal to quantify the performance of the extraction scheme .",
    "this process needs to be repeated for various reionization scenarios to avoid any bias the extraction scheme would have if only a subsample of all possible signal characteristics were used .",
    "simulating observing windows as large as the field of view ( fov ) of lofar ( @xmath3 ) and for frequencies corresponding to redshift 6 to 12 is a daunting task for conventional radiative transfer codes because of multiple reasons such as a requirement for high dynamic range in mass for the sources of reionization , their large number towards the end of reionization and the size of the box which strains the memory of even the largest computer cluster . in order to facilitate the simulation of such large mock data sets for diverse reionization scenarios , we need to implement an approximation to these radiative transfer methods that mimic the `` standard '' simulations to good accuracy .",
    "it was clear from the onset that the details of the ionization fronts like its complex non - spherical nature will not be reproduced by the semi - analytical approach that we propose here .",
    "but the argument towards overlooking this discrepancy is that when the outputs of our semi - analytical approach and that of a radiative transfer code are passed through the machinery of the lofar - eor pipeline , they are experimentally indistinguishable .",
    "the reason being the filtering nature of the telescope s point spread function ( psf ) across the sky and the substantial bandwidth averaging along the frequency / redshift direction that is needed to recover the signal , smoothes out the structural details captured by codes .",
    "recently , several authors @xcite have proposed schemes to reduce the computational burden of generating relatively accurate 21 cm maps .",
    "these methods do fairly well , although there are some caveats , like for example the intergalactic medium ( igm ) ionization being treated as binary , i.e. , the igm is either ionized or neutral @xcite .",
    "although this might be the case for stellar - like sources , others with a power - law component could exhibit an effect on the igm wherein the ionizing front is extended and hence this assumption need not hold @xcite .",
    "added to this , the schemes presented in order to compute the 21 cm maps , make the assumption that the spin temperature of hydrogen , @xmath4 is much larger than the cmb temperature . towards the end of reionization ( @xmath5 )",
    "this might very well be valid .",
    "but the dawn of reionization would see a complex spatial correlation of igm temperatures with the sources of radiation , its clustering and spectral energy distributions @xcite . in the current paper",
    "we have assumed that the spin temperature is coupled to the kinetic temperature and that they are much higher than the cmb temperature . at higher redshifts",
    "this need not be a valid assumption .",
    "the effects of heating by different types of radiative sources on the igm and the coupling ( both ly-@xmath2 and collisional ) between the spin and kinetic temperature will be simulated accurately in a follow - up paper _ thomas et al .",
    ", in prep _ , using the same scheme , but now applied to heating .    in this paper",
    "we propose a method of post processing numerical simulations in order to rapidly generate realistic 21 cm maps .",
    "briefly , the algorithm consists of simulating the ionization fronts created by the `` first '' radiative sources for a range of parameters which include the power spectrum , source mass function and clustering .",
    "we then identify haloes in the outputs of n - body simulations and convert them to a photon count using semi - analytical prescriptions , or using the photon count derived from a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulation . depending on the photon count and the spectrum ,",
    "we embed a sphere around the centre - of - mass ( com ) of the halo whose radial profile matches that of a profile from the table created by the 1-d radiative transfer code of @xcite .",
    "appropriate operations are carried out to conserve photon number . since",
    ", the basic idea is to expand bubbles around locations of the sources of radiation , we call this method bears ( bubble expansion around radiative sources ) . for the sake of brevity and comparison with full radiative transfer codes ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to monochromatic radiative transfer with a fixed temperature .",
    "a following paper will include a full spectrum along with the temperature evolution .",
    "the results of our semi - analytic scheme will be compared to those obtained with the full monte carlo radiative transfer code crash @xcite .    in  [",
    "sec : simulations ] we describe the various steps involved in implementing the bears algorithm on the outputs of n - body simulations .",
    "we describe the specifications of the n - body simulations , the 1-d radiative transfer code used to produce the catalogue of ionization profiles , the algorithm employed to embed the sources and finally an illustrative example of the procedure to correct for the overlap of ionized bubbles . in  [",
    "sec : comparison ] the fully cosmological radiative transfer code crash is summarized and the results of its qualitative and statistical comparison with bears are discussed . ",
    "[ sec : datacube ] describes the method of generating the cube with maps of the brightness temperature ( @xmath6 ) at all the frequencies that will be observed by an eor experiment . in  [ sec : starsvquasars ] we use the simulation of the cube , with maps of the sky at different frequencies , to study the difference between two popular sources of reionization , i.e. , stars and quasars .",
    "these maps in the cube are then filtered through the lofar antenna response to output the final data cube in  [ sec : instrumental ] . finally in  [ sec : conclusions ] we summarize our results and outline further improvements that need to be made in our approach in order to start exploring the large parameter space involved in reionization studies .",
    "in this section the various components of the simulation that lead towards 21 cm brightness temperature ( @xmath7 ) maps are explained .",
    "the very first step of the entire process consists of generating a catalogue of 1-d ionization profiles for different masses / luminosities of the source , their spectra and the density profiles that surround them at different redshifts .",
    "although we assume the density around each source to be constant , we do vary its value as detailed below .",
    "given the locations of the centres of mass of haloes , the photon rate emanating from that region is calculated based on a semi - analytical description ( discussed in section [ sec : starsvquasars ] ) .",
    "given the spectrum , luminosity and the overdensity around the source , a spherical bubble is embedded around that pixel whose radial profile is selected from the table .",
    "the justification for this simple - minded approach is that the universe is relatively homogeneous in density at these high redshifts on the scales probed by upcoming eor experiments .",
    "therefore , we can assume spherical symmetry in our construction of the ionized regions .    in the following subsections we summarize the n - body simulations employed and the 1-d radiative transfer code that was used to generate the catalogue , and we describe in detail the algorithm used to embed the spherical bubbles and the method used to conserve photons in case of overlap .",
    "we used a modified version of the n - body / treepm / sph code gadget-2(@xcite ) to perform a dark matter ( dm ) cosmological simulation containing @xmath8 particles in a box of size @xmath9 and a dm+sph cosmological simulation containing @xmath10 dm and @xmath10 gas particles in a box of size @xmath11 .",
    "the dm particle masses were @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "initial particle positions and velocities were obtained from glass - like initial conditions using cmbfast  ( version 4.1 ; @xcite ) and employing the zeldovich approximation to linearly evolve the particles down to redshift z = 127 .",
    "we assumed a flat @xmath14cdm universe and employed the set of cosmological parameters @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , in agreement with the wmap 3-year observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "data was generated at @xmath21 equally spaced redshifts between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "halos were identified using the friends - of - friends algorithm ( @xcite ) , with linking length @xmath24 .",
    "the gas in the dm+sph simulation is of primordial composition , with a hydrogen mass fraction @xmath25 and a helium mass fraction @xmath26 .",
    "radiative cooling and heating are included assuming ionisation equilibrium , using tables generated with the publicly available package cloudy  ( version 05.07 of the code last described by @xcite ) .",
    "the gas is allowed to cool by collisional ionisation and excitation , emission of free - free and recombination radiation and compton cooling off the cosmic microwave background .",
    "molecular cooling ( by hydrogen and deuterium ) is prevented by the inclusion of a soft ( i.e.  cut off at the lyman - limit ) uv background .",
    "we employed the star formation recipe of @xcite , using a @xcite initial mass function ( imf ) with mass range @xmath27{~\\mbox{m}_{\\odot}}$ ] .    for further analysis ,",
    "sph particle masses were assigned to uniform meshes of size @xmath28 and @xmath10 cells using tsc ( @xcite ) and the gas densities were calculated .",
    "the density field was smoothed on the mesh with a gaussian kernel with standard deviation @xmath29 comoving @xmath30 .",
    "each cell was further assigned a hydrogen - ionizing luminosity according to the stellar mass it contained .",
    "star particles were treated as simple stellar populations and their luminosity was calculated with the population synthesis code of @xcite .",
    "we used stellar masses and ages as determined by the simulation , a chabrier imf consistent with the star formation recipe and assumed a fiducial metal mass fraction @xmath31 .",
    "the catalogue of ionization profiles for different redshifts ( which also translates to different densities at a given redshift ) , spectral energy distributions ( sed ) , times of evolution and masses / luminosities , was created using the 1-d radiative transfer code developed by @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , a set of rate equations are solved at every cell as a function of time .",
    "the equations follow the time - evolution of h@xmath32 , h@xmath33 , he@xmath32 , he@xmath33 , he@xmath34 and temperature at every grid cell . the ionization rates are integrals over the spectrum and the cross sections of the various species .",
    "these were pre - computed and stored in a table to facilitate faster execution .",
    "case - b recombination coefficients are used to calculate the rate at which hydrogen recombines .",
    "the 1-d radiative transfer code starts the simulation at @xmath35 , typically @xmath36  physical @xmath37 from the location of the source .",
    "all hydrogen and helium is assumed to be completely ionized inside this radius , @xmath38",
    ". each cell is then updated for time @xmath39 .",
    "this @xmath39 is not the intrinsic time - step used to solve the differential equation itself because that is adaptive in nature and varies according to the tolerance limit set in the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) solver . on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath39 here decides for how long a particular cell should evolve before moving on to the next .",
    "the code is causal in the sense that cell @xmath40 + 1 is updated after cell @xmath40 .",
    "the light travel time is not taken into consideration explicitly since the ionization front ( i - front ) is typically very subluminal .",
    "hence , all cells are updated to time @xmath41 at the @xmath42 time - step .    after all cells except the last cell @xmath43 have been updated to time @xmath39 ,",
    "the resulting values are stored and then passed on as initial conditions for the evolution of the cell in the next interval of time .",
    "the update of all @xmath44 cells is repeated  @xmath45   times such that  @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the life time of the radiating source .",
    "the various quantities of interest can be stored in a file at intervals of choice .",
    "a radial coverage of @xmath48 is chosen _ a priori _ which , depending on the problem , can be set to any value .",
    "typically we do not need to solve the radiative transfer beyond ten comoving mega - parsecs .",
    "we use an equally spaced grid in radius with a resolution of @xmath49 which , like the time resolution , is decreased to half its value until it meets a given convergence criterion , which here is that the final position of the i - front converges to within @xmath50 .",
    "the implementation of the code is modular .",
    "hence it is straightforward to include different spectra corresponding to different ionizing sources .",
    "our 1-d code can handle x - ray photons and the secondary ionization and heating it causes and therefore performs well for both high ( quasars ) and low energy ( stars ) photons .",
    "further details of the code can be found in @xcite .      in the following section we discuss the algorithm employed to expand reionization bubbles around the locations of radiative sources .",
    "the numerical simulation provides us with the density field at every grid point , the centres of mass of the haloes identified by the fof algorithm , the velocities of these particles and , if the simulation also contains gas , the ionizing luminosity associated with the halo .",
    "equipped with this information about the simulation box at a given redshift , we follow the steps enumerated below to embed the ionized bubbles around the source locations :    1 .",
    "given the redshift , ionizing luminosity and the time for which the ionization front should evolve ( this depends on the type of source ) , select a corresponding file from the catalogue of ionization profiles generated earlier .",
    "2 .   the sources are usually in an overdense region and the density around the source follows a profile .",
    "since the profiles vary from source to source we use the following approximation : we calculate the overdensity around the source for a radius @xmath51 ( where the subscript `` od '' stands for overdensity ) .",
    "we then assume that the source is embedded in a uniform density whose value is the average overdensity within the radius @xmath52 .",
    "this naturally translates in selecting the same ionization profile but now from the table at a higher redshift .",
    "this radius is estimated as described in  [ sec : avgrad ] .",
    "3 .   at lower redshifts",
    "there is considerable overlap between bubbles .",
    "thus , in order to conserve the number of photons , we need to redistribute the photons that ionize the overlapped regions to other regions which are still neutral .",
    "the details of this correction process are given below ( see  [ sec : corr_overlap ] ) .",
    "4 .   when computing the reionization history , ionized regions are mapped one - to - one from the current simulation snapshot onto the next . note that ionization due to recombination radiation has not been included .",
    "the radius @xmath51 is calculated as follows :    * for any given source ( we choose the largest ) in the box we perform the radiative transfer and compute the ionization profile using the ( exact ) spherically averaged radial density profile of the surrounding gas ; * the density within a radius @xmath51 , which we initially choose to be very small , is spherically averaged around the source and the ionization profile corresponding to this mean density is selected from the catalogue . this step is repeated for increasing values of @xmath51 until the extent of the ionization profile matches that of the `` exact '' radiative transfer calculation done in the previous step .",
    "we will refer to the resulting radius as the calibrated @xmath53 ; * @xmath51 for all the other sources are calculated by scaling them with the luminosity of the source according to @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the luminosities of the source under consideration and the calibration source respectively .",
    "a comment to be made here is that because the dynamic range in the halo masses derived from the simulation is not very high the value of @xmath51 does not vary considerably between sources .      at lower redshifts",
    "the sources become more massive and more numerous .",
    "this causes considerable overlap between spheres of close - by sources .",
    "the regions of overlap correspond to some number of unused photons ( depending on the density ) .",
    "the relative simplicity of the implementation of the algorithm arises due to the fact that the ionization fronts created by most sources are `` sharp '' , at least for the resolutions we are able to simulate .",
    "if the ionization front is extended , we can modify the procedure below to accommodate it .",
    "the procedure for correction is illustrated with the help of a simple example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incidence ] :    * create an analogue to an incidence / admittance matrix * a * ( ref equation [ eq : incidence ] for the connection between ionized regions of sources ) : the matrix * a * is a square matrix of size @xmath57 , whose elements are set to 1 if two sources overlap and 0 otherwise . here @xmath58 is the total number of sources in the box .",
    "+ @xmath59 * segment the simulation box into regions that are connected .",
    "this is done by identifying rows that are identical in the matrix * a*. thus , for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : incidence ] there are three different `` connected regions '' , reg1:(1,6,5 ) , reg2:(2,3 ) and reg3:(4 ) . *",
    "calculate the total volume of the overlap zones in each of the connected regions .",
    "for example for reg1 , we have overlap(1,6)+overlap(5,6 ) . * the sizes of all the bubbles in a particular connected region",
    "is increased so as to entail a volume that corresponds to the average overlapped region , i.e. , total overlapped region divided by the number of bubbles in that connected region .",
    "* the sizes of the bubbles are iteratively increased until the volume of the regions that are `` newly ionized '' , i.e. , excluding the regions ionized by the sources before the correction , equals the total overlapped volume .",
    "this ensures a homogeneous redistribution of unused photons all around the region .",
    "the unshaded bubbles in reg1:(1,6,5 ) and reg2:(2,3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : incidence ] depict the expansion of the bubbles .",
    "the bears algorithm is used to generate a series of cubes of ionized fractions at different redshifts and resolutions for the case in which the radiative sources are stars . in this section these cubes are compared with those obtained from the full radiative transfer code crash using the same source list i.e. , source locations , luminosities and spectra . in all comparisons made below",
    "we make use of ionizing luminosities derived from the n - body / sph simulation ( refer  [ sec : nbody ] ) . we have assumed the spectra to be monochromatic at 13.6  @xmath60 .",
    "we first summarize the essentials of the radiative transfer code crash and then discuss a set of visual and statistical comparisons between the results generated using these two approaches .",
    "all comparisons except for the case of @xmath11 , @xmath61 box , in this section is done on boxes where we have not included the reionization history .",
    "one of the major reasons for this is that a full 3-d radiative transfer code like crash would require enormous computational resources to achieve this task . and",
    "on the other hand , it is easier to judge the performance of bears when there a large number of sources overlapping at lower redshifts , whereas if the reionization history is included , the lower redshifts would be completely ionized and most of the interesting characteristics of the comparison would be wiped out .",
    "crash is a ray - tracing radiative transfer code based on monte carlo ( mc ) techniques that are used to sample the probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) of several quantities involved in the calculation , e.g.  spectrum of the sources , emission direction and optical depth .",
    "the mc approach and the code architecture enables applicability over a wide range of astrophysical problems and allows for additional physics to be incorporated with minimum effort . the propagation of the ionizing radiation can be followed through any given h / he static density field sampled on a uniform mesh . at every grid point and time step the algorithm computes the variations in temperature and ionization state of the gas .",
    "the code allows for the possibility of the addition of multiple point sources at any specified point in the box , and also diffuse radiation ( e.g.  the ultraviolet background or the radiation produced by h / he recombinations ) can be self - consistently incorporated .",
    "the energy emitted by point sources in ionizing radiation is discretized into photon packets , beams of ionizing photons , emitted at regularly spaced time intervals .",
    "more specifically , the total energy radiated by a single source of luminosity @xmath62 , during the total simulation time , @xmath63 , is @xmath64 .",
    "for each source , @xmath65 is distributed in @xmath66 photon packets , emitted at the source location at regularly spaced time intervals , @xmath67 .",
    "the time resolution of a given run is thus fixed by @xmath66 and the time evolution is marked by the packets emission : the j - th packet is emitted at time @xmath68 , with @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the total number of emissions of continuum photon packets is @xmath70 .",
    "the emission direction of each photon packet is assigned by mc sampling the angular pdf characteristic of the source .",
    "the propagation of the packet through the given density field is then followed and the impact of radiation - matter interaction on the gas properties is computed on the fly .",
    "each time the packet pierces a cell i , the cell optical depth for ionizing continuum radiation,@xmath71 , is estimated summing up the contribution of the different absorbers ( @xmath72 ) .",
    "the probability for a single photon to be absorbed in the @xmath40th cell is : @xmath73 the trajectory of the packet is followed until its photon content is extinguished or , if open boundary conditions are assumed , until it exits the simulation volume .",
    "the time evolution of the gas physical properties ( ionization fractions and temperature ) is computed solving in each cell the appropriate discretized differential equations each time the cell is crossed by a packet.the reader is referred to @xcite for details of the code .",
    "figure  [ fig : comparered6 ] shows a view of the ionized fraction of hydrogen calculated using crash ( left panel ) and bears ( right panel ) , with isosurfaces shaded dark .",
    "the box shown here is a @xmath10-simulation at a redshift of six for a box with a comoving length of @xmath74 on each side .",
    "globally the two boxes do look very similar .",
    "statistics on these cases and others are presented later . also bear in mind that this case , i.e.",
    ", redshift six , is the one for which we should expect maximum discrepancy between the two methods .",
    "reasons being : one , the universe is much less homogeneous at redshift six than at higher redshifts which is contrary to the basic assumption in bears that the igm is predominantly uniform , two , the bubbles from these ionizing sources become larger ( because the sources grow more massive and because the gas density decreases ) and they invariably overlap with several others which in our case is dealt with in an approximate manner as explained before .        in figs .",
    "[ fig : overlaps256red6 ] & [ fig : overlaps256red9 ] we compare the ionization isocontours from bears ( blue contours ) and crash ( red contours ) for redshifts 6 and 9 , respectively .",
    "the images refer to the simulations in a @xmath10 box with side of length @xmath75 .",
    "as expected , redshift 6 is structurally the most complex with many more sources and multiple overlaps . in all these images we see a distinct feature of the bears algorithm ,",
    "i.e. , that the ionized regions are perfectly spherical when there is no overlap .",
    "also , in case of overlap , the shapes of ionized regions are much more regular than those of crash .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is the local inhomogeneity of the underlying density field . as explained in ",

    "this again can be attributed to the sudden transition in the neutral fraction around radiative sources used by bears .",

    "another aspect of the implementation of the bears scheme is apparent in this plot , i.e. , at higher densities ( @xmath84 ) the agreement between crash and bears is extremely good .",
    "this is because sources are usually located at overdense location and bears uses the density around the source location to estimate the radius of ionized sphere .",

    "this has been reduced by a factor @xmath113 since the slice has been extracted along the diagonal of the fc . in the following sections we will do all our analysis and comparisons on the box generated in the above manner .",
    "although the radiative transfer is performed on each box with the underlying density in real space , we produce the fc for the brightness temperature with densities estimated in redshift space to account for the redshift distortions introduced by the peculiar velocities .",

    "one of the main differences between stars and quasars , apart from the extent of reionization caused by individual sources , is the heating due to quasars .",

    "we see from the figure that the stars start ionizing much earlier than the quasars , but the rate at which they ionize is low . therefore ,",
    "even though the effect of quasars on the ionization is seen later , they manage to ionize the igm earlier than stars .",
    "this is mainly due to the efficiency ( per unit baryon ) of the quasar to ionize the medium and to the fact that in the model we have constructed the miniqso population is not constrained based on the excess of soft x - ray background radiation and therefore the miniqso number density is higher than it would be in reality .",

    "the effect of decreasing entropy is analogoues to case ( b ) & ( d ) with its corresponding histogram in ( hb ) & ( hd ) .",
    "although the entropy increased from ( b ) to ( d ) and also in case of @xmath7 after the convolution , the increase is relatively less .",
    "this is because the smearing action was on scales larger than the fluctuations in @xmath7 hence narrowing the histogram to a few values . at higher frequencies of course",
    "@xmath7 is zero and hence the entropy drops to 0 as well .",
    "a final statistic that was calculated was the probability distribution function ( pdf ) of the @xmath7 at four different redshifts for stars and quasars .",

    "we will incorporate the mixture of sources and the effect of the temperature in an upcoming paper ( thomas et al .",
    ", _ in prep _ ) .",
    "one of the main astrophysical hurdles for the detection of the eor signal is the existence of prominent galactic and extragalactic foregrounds .",
    "typically , the difference between the mean amplitude of the eor signal and the foregrounds is expected to be 4 to 5 orders of magnitude , but an interferometer like lofar measures only the fluctuations which in this case are expected to be different by ` only ' three orders of magnitude @xcite . in subsequent papers",
    "we will explore the effects of foregrounds and their removal strategies .",
    "lofar is being partially funded by the european union , european regional development fund , and by `` samenwerkingsverband noord - nederland '' , ez / kompas .",

    "<S> these sources could either be stars or power - law sources with varying spectral indices . </S>",
    "<S> assuming spherical symmetry , ionized bubbles are created around these sources , whose radial ionized fraction and temperature profiles are derived from a catalogue of 1-d radiative transfer experiments . in case of overlap of these spheres , photons are conserved by redistributing them around the connected ionized regions corresponding to the spheres . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiency with which these maps are created allows us to span the large parameter space typically encountered in reionization simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we compare our results with other , more accurate , 3-d radiative transfer simulations and find excellent agreement for the redshifts and the spatial scales of interest to upcoming 21 cm experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we generate a contiguous observational cube spanning redshift 6 to 12 and use these simulations to study the differences in the reionization histories between stars and quasars . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the signal is convolved with the lofar beam response and its effects are analyzed and quantified . </S>",
