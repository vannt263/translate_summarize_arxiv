    "the fluid of point charges interacting via a logarithmic coulomb potential in a strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) space is a basic model in statistical mechanics with main relevance to the theory of vortex fluctuations in superfluid or superconducting films@xcite .",
    "magro and ceperley@xcite have discussed the bosonic ground state of this model system .",
    "they first used a sum - rule argument from the work of pitaevskii and stringari@xcite to show that the zero - point fluctuations associated with long - wavelength plasmons rule out the presence of a bose - einstein condensate even at zero temperature .",
    "they proceeded to evaluate the single - particle density matrix @xmath0 by quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods and showed that the ground state exhibits algebraic off - diagonal long - range order : the decay of @xmath0 with increasing distance @xmath4 is through the power law @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a coupling strength parameter determined by the areal density @xmath7 .",
    "as magro and ceperley@xcite emphasize , although the ground state of the 2d bose coulomb fluid ( 2d - bcf ) is not condensed , superfluidity is nonetheless possible .",
    "if the model is indeed superfluid , it may then provide an ideal system in which to study the differences between superfluidity and bose - einstein condensation .",
    "a number of structural and collective dynamical properties have been calculated for the 2d - bcf within approximate theoretical schemes@xcite , but no other studies seem to have been made of its momentum distribution and one - body density matrix beyond that of magro and ceperley . in the present paper",
    "we evaluate these properties for the charged fluid in the weak - coupling regime corresponding to high density , by adopting a hydrodynamic reduction of its hamiltonian as previously proposed by popov@xcite for 2d neutral bose fluids ( see also meng@xcite ) .",
    "a crucial point of our approach is to allow for a difference between the long - wavelength dispersion relations of single - particle and collective excitations at finite temperature @xmath2 , through the use of distinct @xmath1-sum rules on the superfluid and the total particle number densities@xcite .",
    "we recover by this approach the results of magro and ceperley@xcite for the power - law decay of @xmath0 in the ground state and obtain their extension to finite temperature .",
    "we show that within this approach the 2d - bcf is indeed superfluid at @xmath8 and that in the weak - coupling regime a slowly declining superfluid fraction persists as the temperature is raised .",
    "in fact , the superfluid fraction enters to determine the value of the exponent for the power - law decay of @xmath0 .",
    "the presence of the superfluid density in the power - law decay of the density matrix in a neutral 2d bose gas was already argued by popov@xcite .",
    "our present progress in understanding the properties of the 2d - bcf borrows from the theory of a quasicondensate state in the neutral 2d bose gas , that was developed by a number of authors@xcite and has also been used within a bogoliubov approach to describe the 2d fluid of charged bosons with @xmath9 interactions@xcite .",
    "in essence , the local properties of a quasicondensate , over distances that are shorter than the phase correlation length , are the same as those of a genuine condensate . however ,",
    "in our treatment of the 2d - bcf we dispense with the notion of a quasicondensate fraction and base our arguments on the @xmath1-sum rule for the superfluid fraction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , after introducing the hamiltonian of the charged fluid with its neutralizing background and recalling the @xmath1-sum rules for a superfluid from the work of hohenberg and martin@xcite , we present the hydrodynamic hamiltonian as expressed in terms of density and phase operators . following meng@xcite",
    "we diagonalize it in the momentum representation and obtain a dispersion relation for single - particle excitations which has the bogoliubov form but contains the superfluid density in place of the condensate density . in section",
    "iii we use the hydrodynamic hamiltonian to determine the power - law decay of the one - body density matrix from the behavior of the correlations between phase fluctuations entering the single - particle green s function . in section",
    "iv we evaluate @xmath0 by using the resummation method adopted by other authors@xcite to deal with a fluid with a quasicondensate , and show that the power - law decay obtained from the single - particle green s function is recovered .",
    "we then report in section v numerical results for the superfluid density from landau s formula and for the one - body density matrix as functions of temperature at various values of the coupling strength @xmath6 in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "section vi concludes the paper with a brief summary . in an appendix",
    "we show that the standard bogoliubov approach@xcite would indeed yield that the condensate fraction is zero in the ground state of the 2d - bcf .",
    "the 2d - bcf is described by the hamiltonian @xmath10\\psi({\\bf r } ) + \\frac{1}{2}\\int d{\\bf r}\\int d{\\bf r}'\\psi^\\dagger({\\bf r})\\psi^\\dagger({\\bf r}')v(|{\\bf r}-{\\bf r}'| ) \\psi({\\bf",

    "this is the solution of the 2d poisson equation @xmath15 , yielding @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a reference length that we shall take as @xmath18 .",
    "the fourier transform of the potential is @xmath19 , and in the following we shall set @xmath20 on account of a uniform background ensuring global charge neutrality@xcite .",
    "the coupling strength is measured by the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 , which is defined by @xmath21 .",
    "a special role will be played in the following by a sum rule involving the superfluid density @xmath22 .",
    "we first recall that the usual @xmath1-sum rule@xcite involving the particle density @xmath7 can be recast through the continuity equation into a sum rule on the longitudinal current - current response function @xmath23 , @xmath24 for a charged fluid this is equivalent to the well - known plasmon sum rule on the longitudinal electrical current density .",
    "in addition to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , a sum rule involving the response function of the superfluid velocity @xmath25 holds in a superfluid@xcite , which reads @xmath26 the role of this relation as a long - wavelength @xmath1-sum rule on the superfluid response becomes evident from its similarity to eq .",
    "( 2 ) when it is rewritten as a sum rule for the superfluid particle current density @xmath27 .",
    "we are now ready to proceed to a hydrodynamic reduction of the hamiltonian ( 1 ) , following the work of popov@xcite and meng@xcite on neutral superfluids .",
    "this is obtained by making the transformation @xmath28},\\;\\;\\;\\;\\;\\psi^\\dagger({\\bf",

    "@xmath31 and @xmath32 are the particle density and phase operators .",

    "it will be used in the next section as the dispersion relation of single - particle excitations in the evaluation of the phase - phase correlations from the single - particle green s function .",
