    "the total cross section ( @xmath1 ) and the elastic cross section ( @xmath2 ) are fundamental quantities in the study of elastic hadron scattering . their ratio , as a function of the c.m .",
    "energy squared , @xmath3 plays also an important role @xcite : it is related to the ratio of the inelastic cross section ( @xmath4 ) to the total cross section via unitarity ; it is connected to the central opacity in hadron - hadron collisions ( impact parameter representation ) ; it can be related to the ratio between @xmath1 and the elastic slope @xmath5 , which is an important quantity in studies on extensive air showers ( cosmic - ray experiments ) .",
    "however , @xmath6 connects two quantities associated with soft strong scattering states , which , presently , are not directly and unequivocally described from the first principles of qcd . in this situation ,",
    "a possible strategy of investigation is to obtain phenomenological and/or empirical descriptions of these quantities which may contribute with the search of suitable calculational schemes in the nonpertubative sector of qcd .    in this communication",
    ", we present an empirical approach for studying @xmath6 in the case of proton - proton ( @xmath7 ) and antiproton - proton ( @xmath8 ) scattering .",
    "this analysis follows previous studies by fagundes and menon @xcite and fagundes , menon and silva @xcite . here , besides the new experimental data on @xmath1 and @xmath2 obtained at the cern - lhc at 7 and 8 tev by totem collaboration @xcite , we also include the recent atlas collaboration results at 7 tev @xcite . by means of a suitable empirical parametrization and fits to the experimental data , we investigate different asymptotic scenarios for @xmath6 .",
    "our analysis favors a scenario below the black - disk limit , consistent with the rational value 1/3 .",
    "we discuss some preliminary tests on the selection of free parameters and infer that 1/4 may constitute an upper bound for the ratio between the soft diffractive cross section ( single / double dissociation ) and the inelastic cross section .",
    "our dataset comprises measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 from @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering obtained in accelerator experiments , from @xmath9 gev up to @xmath10 tev @xcite .",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties have been added in quadrature .",
    "the experimental points for @xmath11 are shown in figure 1 . in this figure",
    "we also display the point at 57 tev obtained via unitarity from the estimates of @xmath1 and @xmath4 by the pierre auger collaboration @xcite ; this point did not take part in the data reductions : it is shown only as an illustration of cosmic - ray information presently available .",
    "on the one hand , from the empirical behavior of @xmath11 ( figure  [ f1 ] ) , we see that this quantity decreases until @xmath12 gev and then begins to rise as the energy increases and with a positive curvature . on the other hand",
    "it is expected that the ratio @xmath6 becomes constant when @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath6 saturates .",
    "the value of this constant can change from model to model ( see discussion below ) .",
    "since the saturation implies in a negative curvature , it is expected a change of curvature in @xmath6 at some finite energy . based on these facts and looking for an economical number of free parameters , we consider the following analytical parametrization : @xmath14 with @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are dimensionless parameters , in principle , free fit parameters and @xmath21 is a fixed energy scale .",
    "as constructed , the parameter @xmath16 corresponds to the asymptotic value of @xmath6 , @xmath22 and the hyperbolic tangent takes account of the change of curvature .",
    "therefore , in data reductions , by fixing @xmath16 we can define an asymptotic scenario or by letting it free we can select a scenario .",
    "the standard scenario in the phenomenological context , typical of eikonal models ( for example , @xcite ) , concerns the black disk limit , which predicts @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "however , theoretical , phenomenological and empirical arguments , allow also to consider scenarios either above or below the black disk , as discussed in what follows .      from the @xmath24-channel unitarity , @xmath25 therefore , a maximum value for the ratio @xmath11 allowed in the formal context reads @xmath26 .    moreover , two well known formal limits ( the froissart - lukaszuk - martin bound for total cross section @xcite and a similar bound for the inelastic cross section @xcite ) predict @xmath27 now , assuming that _ both limits saturate _ when @xmath13 , it is possible that @xmath28 , and therefore , from unitarity , we have also a  formal \" possibility @xmath29 (  formal \" result ) .",
    "we recall that a scenario above the black disk is also indicated in the phenomenological context through the @xmath30-matrix unitarity scheme @xcite .      taking into account the totem empirical fit to @xmath2 data @xcite and the highest - rank fit result to @xmath1 data by the compete collaboration @xcite , the central values of the free parameters lead to the asymptotic ratio ( see @xcite for details ) @xmath31 ( totem / compete ) .",
    "moreover , in a recent study on the rise of @xmath1 , we have considered a parametrization with regge , pomeron terms and a leading contribution in the form @xmath32 , with @xmath19 either fixed to 2 or as a free fit parameter @xcite .",
    "the parametrization was also extended to fit the @xmath2 data and in all cases investigated we have obtained asymptotic ratios @xmath11 below the black disk and consistent with the rational limits between @xmath0 and @xmath33 @xcite . as an extreme scenario we consider here the lowest value obtained in the analyses ( denoted fms ) , which , within the uncertainties from error propagation , reads @xmath34 ( minimum fms ) .    in what follows",
    "we shall consider the asymptotic limits a = 1.0 , 0.75 , 0.50 , 0.436 , 0.30 , as representative values for investigating the three different scenarios .",
    "as already commented , with parametrization ( 2 - 3 ) , once @xmath16 is fixed to each one of the aforementioned values we define an asymptotic scenario and by letting @xmath16 as a free parameter we can select a scenario .",
    "different fits and procedures have been tested in order to select a best value for the energy scale @xmath21 , which led to the energy cutoff as an optimum value .",
    "therefore , we fix @xmath35 25 gev@xmath36 .    in",
    "what follows , we first present the fits to only @xmath7 data , since , as we shall demonstrate , they allow us to fix ( eliminate ) one of the free parameters in ( 2 - 3 ) . with this particular parametrization",
    "the fits are then extended to include @xmath8 data .",
    "the dataset consists of 29 points ( cutoff at 5 gev ) , including those at 7 and 8 tev by the totem @xcite and atlas collaborations @xcite .",
    "we have fixed @xmath16 to each value referred to above and letting free the parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the results are shown in table  [ t1 ] , together with the statistical information on the fit results : reduced chi - squared ( @xmath37 ) and integrated probability @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    ".[t1]fit results to only @xmath7 data through parametrization ( 2 - 3 ) ( @xmath20 as a free parameter , @xmath16 fixed ) and statistical information ( @xmath39 = 25 ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have presented an empirical analysis of the experimental data presently available on the ratio @xmath40 above 5 gev , including all the recent data at 7 and 8 tev obtained at the lhc by the totem and atlas collaborations .",
    "our model - independent parametrization , characterized by a small number of free parameters ( 3 or 4 ) , allows consistent descriptions of all the experimental data analyzed ( figures  [ f1 ] and [ f2 ] ) .    by letting free",
    "the parameter @xmath16 , the resulting asymptotic value of @xmath11 is compatible with a scenario _ below _ the black - disk limit , namely @xmath41 .",
    "this value is in agreement with our previous results based in distinct analyses @xcite ; it is also in plenty agreement with the recent phenomenological approach by kohara , ferreira and kodama @xcite which predicts @xmath42 for @xmath13 .",
    "taking into account the pumplin bound , it was possible to infer an upper bound for the ratio @xmath43 , consistent with the rational value 1/4 .",
    "our next steps concern a review on all the results presented here and in @xcite , extensions of the analysis treating other choices for @xmath44 and detailed investigation on the change of curvature in @xmath6 at the lhc energy region @xcite .",
