    "the skeleton of the boxy and peanut - like ( b / p ) structures observed in edge - on disc galaxies is considered to be the families of periodic orbits ( hereafter p.o . ) , which constitute the x1-tree .",
    "these are the families bifurcating from the planar x1 family @xcite which lies on the equatorial plane , at the @xmath1 vertical resonances @xcite . despite the fact that the periodic orbits determine their environment in the phase - space , the main body of the structures are non - periodic orbits .",
    "it is known that even in 2d hamiltonian systems quasi - periodic orbits trapped around stable periodic orbits do not necessarily support a structure of similar morphology .",
    "a morphology similar to the one of the p.o . is secured mainly by quasi - periodic orbits on invariant curves close to it .",
    "contrarily , quasi - periodic orbits on invariant curves at the outer parts of stability islands may support more complicated structures .",
    "for example quasi - periodic orbits trapped around elliptical x1 orbits in 2d ferrers bars can support an ansae type bar , if orbits closer to the borders of the x1 stability islands are populated @xcite .",
    "this independence between the morphologies of the p.o . and of the structures around them",
    "is expected to be more pronounced in 3d systems .",
    "also the extent and the significance of the phenomenon of stickiness @xcite in building a 3d bar and a b / p bulge has not been investigated up to now .    in a recent series of papers @xcite we have presented the dynamical fingerprints of nonperiodic orbits close to p.o . in",
    "3d rotating hamiltonian potentials of galactic type .",
    "for this purpose we used the colour - rotation method proposed by @xcite in order to visualise the 4d spaces of sections . in this way we have associated typical structures in the 4d space with the neighbourhood of stable , as well a with simple , double and complex unstable periodic orbits @xcite .",
    "studies of other hamiltonian systems of galactic type @xcite , or even studies of maps @xcite , in which the 4d space is visualised , indicate that the main structures depend basically on the corresponding kind of instability , or stability , of the p.o . in the present paper",
    "we take advantage of the colour - rotation technique in order to investigate the phase space of the b / p and x - shaped structures in our model .",
    "this method has been proven to be especially efficient in estimating the role of sticky orbits @xcite .    referring to b / p - shaped bulges",
    "we mean boxy structures , the morphology of which can be schematically described either with the symbol `` '' or with the symbol    `` @xmath2 ''    . @xcite and @xcite characterise these two qualitatively different profiles of edge - on disc galaxies as `` ox '' and `` cx '' respectively . in many cases wings of an `` x '' feature",
    "delineate the peanut shape of the bulge , so the terms `` ox '' and `` cx '' refer to an off - centred or centred `` x '' respectively .",
    "we assume that the x feature traces the extrema of the b / p bulge .",
    "let us assume that it reaches a maximum radius along the major axis @xmath3 and a maximum height vertical to the equatorial plane @xmath4 . as we concluded in @xcite",
    "the b / p bulge is part of the 3d bar , which is in agreement with the results of studies with different approaches to the same problem ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , the estimation of the extent of the bar in edge - on galaxies is usually based on identifying `` bumps '' in the surface brightness profiles in cuts along or parallel to their major axes as indicated originally by @xcite .",
    "the qualitative and quantitative analysis of such profiles allowed @xcite to estimate the ratio of the length of the bar to the length of the b / p distortion to be about @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite ( his appendix c ) presented the unsharp - masked profiles of a sample of 25 edge - on galaxies with b / p bulges , which reveal a clear x feature ( see also * ? ? ? * ) . by measuring approximately the dimensions of the x features in the unsharp - masked images of this sample , one can empirically estimate roughly a variation of the @xmath6 ratio , to be @xmath7 .",
    "we estimated a mode value close to @xmath8 .",
    "this quantity depends primarily on the orientation of the bar with respect to the line of sight and is expected to be small for bars viewed nearly end - on and large for bars viewed nearly side - on , since @xmath4 will not vary substantially .",
    "this is important information for deciding which orbits populate a b / p structure .",
    "the goal of our study is to identify orbits which could reinforce these structures and reproduce the observed ratios of their geometrical dimensions .",
    "the study of the body of the orbital content of b / p bulges can provide valuable information about the properties of the stellar component of standard galactic bars similar to the bar of the milky way @xcite .",
    "non - periodic orbits reflect the dynamical mechanism that determines the volume and the regions of the phase space , which they occupy .",
    "moreover they provide kinematic imprints that can be compared with observed quantities @xcite or with results of @xmath9-body simulations @xcite .",
    "this comparison can lead in favouring or excluding dynamical mechanisms and help us understand the internal structure of the peanuts .",
    "the first step towards this comparison is to register all types of orbital behaviour , regular and chaotic , that leads in profiles observed in edge - on disc galaxies .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : the model used and a brief review on the stability of p.o . in 3d hamiltonian systems is given in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "in section  [ sec : start ] we discuss the origin of the b / p bulge , investigating the lowest energy orbits that could support a b / p feature .",
    "we present the dynamical phenomena in the neighbourhood of the main families of p.o . in the region of the radial and vertical ilrs in section  [ sec : between ] . in section  [ sec : x1v1p ] we investigate the role of chaotic orbits in the side - on profiles based on the dynamics of the x1v1 family , while the different mechanisms that could lead to an ` '  or    `` @xmath2 ''    -type profile are considered in section  [ sec : x1v2 ] . in section  [ sec : geom ] we deal with projection effects that are important for the profiles we examine and finally we give a summary of the paper by enumerating our conclusions in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "since clear b / p bulges and especially x features are usually associated with strong bars we have chosen the `` strong bar case '' model of @xcite for our calculations .",
    "this model has the most massive bar with respect to the disc from all other models investigated in that paper .",
    "the general model consists of a miyamoto disc , a plummer bulge and a 3d ferrers bar .",
    "it is a popular and extensively studied model for 3d bars , initially used by @xcite . here",
    ", we briefly describe the three components of the model to facilitate the reader of the current paper .",

    "the main result of the present study is that there is a significant contribution from sticky chaotic orbits to the building of the body of b / p structures in the side - on profiles of disc galaxy models .",
    "the families of the x1-tree can be considered as the backbone of the peanut structure in two ways .",
    "on one hand they trap around them quasi - periodic orbits and on the other hand they create obstacles for chaotic orbits that hinder their diffusion in phase space .",
    "these obstacles are the tori around orbits belonging to families of the x1-tree ( mainly of x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 ) .",
    "the tori act as attractors for chaotic orbits , which become sticky to them .",
    "the important region for the peanut structure is the e@xmath74 interval of the radial - ilr and vertical - ilr .",
    "we find that in the frame of the current paradigm a new family plays a key role , namely x1mul2 , which is of multiplicity two .",
    "this family of p.o . can either reinforce b / p side - on profiles based mainly on a x1v1-x1v1@xmath0 backbone , or even support a b / p morphology just by itself . in more detail our conclusions",
    "can be summarised as follows :    1 .",
    "we find non - periodic orbits supporting a b / p profile in the side - on view _ before _ the critical energy in the v - ilr region at which x1v1 is bifurcated from x1 .",
    "these orbits are quasi - periodic orbits on tori around stable x1 orbits .",
    "their outline tends to a combined x1v1-x1v1@xmath0 morphology as e@xmath74 increases towards the value at which x1v1 is introduced in the system ( fig .",
    "[ thickx1 ] ) .",
    "this tells us firstly that the peanut starts before the v - ilr resonance . in our model ,",
    "peanut - supporting orbits are found extending along the major axis of the bar already at y=0.13 bar lengths .",
    "secondly , that the structure of the phase space in the neighbourhood of the mother family changes in a way that the coming of the bifurcated family can be foreseen by the gradual change in the shape of its quasi - periodic orbits .",
    "we do not have an abrupt change of the phase space structure immediately upon the introduction of the bifurcated family in the system .",
    "non - periodic orbits in the neighbourhood of x1 reinforce boxy profiles even in the interval in which x1 is simple unstable .",
    "these are orbits , which either become sticky to the nearby x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 rotational tori , or in general orbits that can be observed being trapped in cylindrical structures in 3d projections of the 4d spaces of section that include the @xmath116 plane .",
    "this is a significant dynamical mechanism for building the body of the peanut .",
    "3 .   the neighbourhood of x1 p.o . is a substantial source of non - periodic orbits that contribute to boxy side - on profiles .",
    "they provide such orbits to the system before the v - ilr and in the @xmath142e@xmath109 region where it is u. of particular significance is its contribution in regions where x1 is the only stable family of p.o . in the system ( in our model @xmath238e@xmath74 @xmath239 ) .",
    "these orbits contribute to a b / p morphology mainly by becoming sticky to x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 rotational tori .",
    "else , they contribute to an overall edge - on boxiness .",
    "4 .   in the @xmath64e@xmath109 region , apart from the u x1 p.o .",
    "we have also the u x3 p.o .",
    "the structure of the phase space around them is different , since they are unstable to vertical and radial perturbations respectively .",
    "the structure of the phase space in the neighbourhood of u p.o . is determined by the type of simple instability of the p.o .",
    "edge - on profiles of non - periodic orbits in the neighbourhood of x2 and x3 have a certain similarity ( fig .",
    "[ x1x3per ] ) .",
    "thus they will have similar contribution to b / p profiles of galactic bars .",
    "they reach heights about 100  pc , considerably smaller than the heights of the boxy bulges in images of edge - on galaxies .",
    "this indicates that if x2 stellar flows exist in 3d stellar bars , they are embedded inside the edge - on profiles of the b / p structures .",
    "6 .   in the case of x - shaped features built by orbits associated with the x1v1 family ,",
    "the `` x '' is formed by the tips of orbits with rather `` @xmath240''-like or `` @xmath162''-like morphologies in their side - on views . along the wings of `` x '' we have @xmath241 ( fig .",
    "[ noperorbs ] ) .",
    "the morphology of a b / p structure is always characterised by the outermost orbits .",
    "models in which we observe sharp wings emerging out of boxy structures can be constructed by populating orbits in the x1v1 neighbourhood at e@xmath74 beyond the @xmath64 part of the x1v1 family .",
    "the part of the b / p bulge supported by chaotic orbits at energies where x1v1 is @xmath64 , is expected to have less conspicuous `` x - wings '' .",
    "bars with moderate amplitudes can support more efficiently a x - shaped b / p bulge based on x1v1 dynamics , because in this case this family is complex unstable over smaller @xmath64e@xmath74 ranges .",
    "`` cx - type '' profiles can be supported : 1 .   by quasi - periodic orbits around x1 in energies , where the x1v2 family co - exists .",
    "they become more important as we increase their @xmath152 initial condition from 0 towards the @xmath152 value of x1v2 .",
    "the strongest reinforcement is given by orbits corresponding to the closest to x1v2 tori around x1 .",
    "2 .   by sticky chaotic orbits around the x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 tori .",
    "we find such orbits by perturbing the x1v2 initial conditions , since the unstable asymptotic curves around x1v2 wind around the tori of the x1v1 and x1v1@xmath0 families .",
    "8 .   a very important role for the dynamics of the b / p bulge is played by the family of multiplicity 2 , x1mul2 .",
    "this family exists already at energies smaller than the one at which x1v1 is introduced in the system , being stable over large @xmath64e@xmath74 energy intervals .",
    "quasi - periodic orbits trapped around the orbits of this family and , mainly , sticky orbits to them reinforce a b / p structure . 9 .",
    "we find chaotic orbits in the neighbourhood of complex unstable periodic orbits that can contribute to the reinforcement of a b / p structure for several tens of dynamical times . in our model , in the case of chaotic orbits close to complex unstable x1v1 p.o .",
    "there is a correlation between the degree of confinement of the chaotic orbit in the configuration space and the value of the quantity @xmath64 ( eq .  [ eq : delta ] ) . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ noperorbs ] , the smaller the quantity @xmath64 is , the largest the deviation of its morphology from that of a quasi - periodic orbit .",
    "interesting for the general theory of hamiltonian systems is the correspondence found between the structure of the phase space in the neighbourhood of simple and double complex unstable p.o . in the case of p.o . of double multiplicity",
    "the 4d spiral structure is developed in two confined tori simultaneously .",
    "we see also that tiny perturbations of complex unstable periodic orbits do not lead to an abrupt filling of the available phase space by the consequents of the two orbits . in a case with two `` @xmath64 '' p.o .",
    "( one of simple and one of double multiplicity ) , which co - exist at the same e@xmath74 , we have found orbits in their immediate neighbourhood that stay in different regions of the phase space for thousands of consequents .",
    "10 . considering non - periodic orbits at successive energies introduced in the system through one of the dynamical mechanisms described in our paper",
    ", one can build conspicuous b / p profiles mainly in their side - on views .",
    "away from the side - on view we have in general just a boxy morphology in the outer envelopes of the edge - on projections .",
    "however , in the case of x - shaped boxy bulges based on x1v1 dynamics , we find nearly end - on views , where the same orbits can give an `` @xmath2''-type morphology .",
