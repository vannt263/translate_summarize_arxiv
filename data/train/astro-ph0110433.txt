    "x - ray observations of snrs provide crucial information on the poorly known initial distribution of pulsar magnetic field strengths and spin periods , as well as on the ages and dynamics of the supernovae which created them . to date , only five galactic crab - like and eight composite remnants have been detected at x - ray wavelengths ; often , the essential spectral information is poor .    a classic composite remnant with the faintest radio core component detected to date ( only 100 mjy ; helfand et al . 1989 )",
    ", g16.7 + 0.1 has comparable radio luminosities in the core and shell components ; the shell and core radii are @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "g16.7 + 0.1 was observed on @xmath2 march 2001 with the _ xmm - newton _ observatory .",
    "data were obtained from all three of the cameras which form the epic instrument ( see figure [ picture ] ) .",
    "the pn and the two mos cameras are ccd arrays sensitive to photons with energies between 0.1 and 15  kev ; the ccd pixel sizes are 1.1 and 4.1@xmath3 , respectively .",
    "the _ xmm _ standard analysis system ( sas ) was used to filter the data for good events within the camera s energy range ; additionally , periods of high background activity were identified and removed .",
    "this produced filtered data sets of 8.7  ks and 8.8  ks for the mos cameras , and of 5.5  ks for the pn camera .    because of its distance and position , the absorption column density ( @xmath4 ) to the remnant is high , and few source photons",
    "are detected at energies @xmath5  kev .",
    "spectral fitting was done from 1 to @xmath6  kev , with the upper limit being slightly different for each camera .",
    "the position of the remnant on the pn camera was perilously close to the gap between two chips .",
    "these data were therefore used exclusively to verify the consistency of results obtained from mos data .",
    "the bright arcs easily visible in the data from all three detectors are due to single - scatter photons from the nearby bright x - ray binary gx17 + 2 . to characterize the contribution of the arcs to the source background , where they are dim but present , we compared spectra of different arc regions to detect possible variations . finding none , we divided the central mos chip into three polygonal areas .",
    "this geometry mimics the elliptical shape of the arcs ; a given region contains a full section of any arc present in that part of the chip .    figure [ region ] is a section of the filtered mos1 image . the area to the right is used to characterize the arcs , the one to the left to characterize the `` normal '' background .",
    "the central area corresponds to the source background and is a weighed sum of arcs and background .",
    "two circles are centered on the source ; the larger ( r = 135 ) is the radio remnant , while the smaller ( r = 45 ) zeroes in on the brightest emission region , coincident with the radio synchrotron core . the circles center , ra @xmath7 , dec @xmath8 , is the snr s apparent geometrical center at 6 cm ( helfand et al .",
    "the different areas are not equal and scalings are applied in correcting or comparing them .",
    "all spectra were grouped to contain a minimum of 25 counts bin@xmath9 , and locally generated response functions were employed .",
    "the canned response files , available from the _ xmm _ website , were used to check for consistency .",
    "all errors are quoted for a 1-@xmath10 confidence range .",
    "spectra were extracted from the mos images for a circular region of radius 45 , and fit simultaneously over the energy ranges 1 to 8.4 kev for mos1 and 1 to 7.5 kev for mos2 ( the upper limits being set by the data quality ) .",
    "a power - law modified for interstellar absorption is an excellent description of the core s spectrum .",
    "xspec returns a photon index @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with a reduced @xmath13 for a fit using the backgrounds models and locally generated rmfs and arfs ( see figure [ fit ] ; the results obtained with the canned response files are essentially identical , with @xmath14 ) .",
    "fixing @xmath15 and @xmath4 to these values and fitting the extracted pn spectrum ( for a smaller area : r = 28 ) returns @xmath16 over 1 to 10 kev .    for a soft band of 1 to 3 kev and a hard band of 3 to 8 kev , the hardness ratio ( ( n@xmath17n@xmath18)/(n@xmath19n@xmath18 )",

    "+ 0.1 , the total galactic hi @xmath20 . generally , x - ray derived @xmath4 values are @xmath21 to 3 times the radio @xmath4 for a given object .",
    "the snr is thus at least on the other side of the galactic center ; we take d @xmath22 kpc .",
    "pimms gives an unabsorbed flux for the core of @xmath23 ergs @xmath24 s@xmath9 over 0.5 to 10 kev , so @xmath25 .",
    "g16.7 + 0.1 s core has a radio luminosity @xmath26 ergs s@xmath9 , so @xmath27 , similar to msh15 - 52 ( @xmath28 ) and ctb80 ( @xmath29 ) ( helfand & becker 1987 ) , and intermediate between very young snrs ( @xmath30 for kes 75 , psr b0540 - 69 , and the crab ) , and older snrs ( @xmath31 for vela ) .      the small number of counts ( @xmath30 for each mos camera ) from the snr shell ( defined as coincident with the radio nebula s area , r @xmath32 ) does not allow us to constrain the nature of the emission or comment on its hardness ratio relative to the core s .",
