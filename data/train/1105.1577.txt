    "we consider a problem relevant to optical molecular imaging ( omi ) , which is a fast - growing research area . in this application",
    ", biochemical markers can be used to detect the presence of specific molecules or genes , and suitably designed markers could potentially identify diseases before phenotypical symptoms even appear .",
    "the markers are typically light - emitting molecules , such as fluorophores or luminophores .",
    "in contrast to single positron emission computed tomography ( spect ) , positron emission tomography ( pet ) , or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , optical markers emit low - energy near - infrared photons that are relatively harmless to human tissue .",
    "further specifics can be found in the bioengineering literature such as @xcite .",
    "the inverse problem we consider consists of reconstructing the spatial distribution of a radiation source from measurements of photon intensities at the boundary of the medium in specific outgoing directions . in many applications ,",
    "the propagation of photons emitted can be modeled as inverse source problems of steady - state radiative transfer equations . once we know the optical properties of the underlying medium , the problem of determining the source is feasible .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that under mild assumptions on the scattering and absorption parameters of the medium this is possible . however , in the partial data case , which will be made more clear shortly , one can only hope to recover information about the singularities of the source . in particular , we seek to recover information about the wavefront set of the source function .",
    "we now describe more precisely the mathematical problem .",
    "we assume @xmath3 to be a bounded domain in @xmath4 with smooth boundary and outer unit normal vector @xmath5 . as in @xcite",
    ", we also assume that @xmath3 is strictly convex .",
    "the authors of that paper note that this is not an essential assumption , since for the problem considered one can always push the boundary away and make it strictly convex without losing generality .",
    "moreover , we assume that the data is given on the boundary of a larger domain @xmath6 .",
    "we remark that this condition is not needed for existence and uniqueness of the solution to the forward problem , but it is required for the stability result ( [ stability ] ) , which is adapted from the proof for the complete data case .    consider the radiative transfer equation @xmath7 where the absorption @xmath8 and the collision kernel @xmath2 are functions with regularity specified later , the solution @xmath9 gives the intensity of photons at @xmath10 moving in the direction @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the set of points @xmath13 such that @xmath14 .",
    "that is , @xmath12 is the set of points @xmath13 such that @xmath11 is pointing outward or inward , respectively .",
    "the source term @xmath15 will be assumed to depend on @xmath10 only for our purposes .",
    "we also remark that equation [ transport ] is only applicable at a single frequency , as the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath2 typically depend highly on frequency .",
    "in particular , for high energy photons there is a coupling between energy and angle , whereas for photons with low energy scattering is not accompanied by an energy change .    in the case of full data ,",
    "we have boundary measurements @xmath16 in @xcite , it is shown that for an open , dense set of absorption and scattering coefficients @xmath17 , one can recover @xmath18 uniquely from boundary measurements @xmath19 on all of @xmath20 . to set up the case of partial data , first let @xmath21 be open and let @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 be a smooth cutoff function such that @xmath24 for @xmath25 and @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "the boundary measurements are then given by @xmath28 to make notation a bit simpler , if @xmath29 ( complete data ) we will just write @xmath30 , since in this case @xmath31 .    in section [ direct ] we will review the direct problem and some relevant results of use in the partial data case .",
    "we also establish some results about singular integrals that will be needed to prove the main theorem .",
    "in section [ inverse ] we consider the inverse problem with partial data , which consists of determining the source term @xmath15 from measuring @xmath32 .",
    "we also compute the normal operator @xmath33 when the scattering coefficient @xmath34 .",
    "note that when @xmath35 , the operators @xmath30 and @xmath36 are the standard x - ray transforms with full and limited data , respectively . when @xmath37 , then @xmath36 is a weighted x - ray transform .",
    "following , in section [ partialinjective ] we establish an injectivity result for @xmath18 supported in the _ visible set _ assuming analytic @xmath8 .",
    "finally , in section [ partialwavefront ] we prove the main theorem that one can recover the visible singularities of @xmath15 with respect to the chosen set @xmath38 when @xmath39 .",
    "both results are based on the microlocal approach used in @xcite .",
    "results needed pertaining to singular integral operators are located in appendix [ singularresults ] .",
    "when dealing with the inverse problem , which we will describe in detail in section [ inverse ] , we need to take a larger domain ( strictly convex for convenience ) that compactly contains @xmath3",
    ". that is , fix a strictly convex open set @xmath40 with smooth boundary such that @xmath6 .",
    "the strict convexity of @xmath40 ensures that the functions @xmath41 are smooth , where @xmath41 is the travel time from @xmath42 to @xmath43 in the direction @xmath44 . in other words",
    "@xmath45 we will extend @xmath8 and @xmath2 to functions on @xmath40 with the same regularity .",
    "we choose and fix this extension as a continuous operator in those spaces .",
    "now define @xmath46 in the same way as for @xmath30 . from this",
    "we can look at the restriction of @xmath47 applied to functions @xmath15 supported in @xmath48 by first extending such @xmath15 as zero on @xmath49 .",
    "essentially , we are moving the observation surface outward a bit and taking measurements on @xmath43 .",
    "when dealing with the inverse problem , we will usually abuse notation and write @xmath30 instead of @xmath47 , with the understanding that we ve already extended the domain @xmath3 to @xmath40 .",
    "it is proven in ( theorem 2 , @xcite ) that the operator @xmath30 is injective for such an open , dense set of coefficients @xmath50 as in ( theorem 1 , @xcite ) with @xmath18 , and a stability result is obtained for the normal operator @xmath51 . here the adjoint @xmath52 is defined with respect to the measure @xmath53 , which we define shortly .",
    "more specifically , for an open and dense set of pairs @xmath54 , including a neighborhood of @xmath55 , we have that the conclusions of ( theorem 1 , @xcite ) hold in @xmath40 , that @xmath47 is injective on @xmath56 , and the stability estimate @xmath57 for a constant @xmath58 locally uniform in @xmath50 .    before stating the main results of this paper , we need to define the set of points such that @xmath36 is injective when restricted to sources supported there .",
    "this set will clearly depend on @xmath38 .",
    "we also denote by @xmath59 as the line starting at @xmath10 with direction @xmath11 .",
    "we define the _ visible set _ @xmath60 by @xmath61    it is relatively straightforward to show since @xmath38 is open , @xmath62 is open as well .",
    "the proof is left to the reader .",
    "consists of a connected open subset of the boundary together with all outgoing directions.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now we can state the first main result , which is an injectivity condition adapted from results in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath63 be an open set and let @xmath62 be as defined above .",
    "let @xmath64 .",
    "then there exists an open and dense set of pairs @xmath65 including a neighborhood of @xmath55 , such that for each @xmath50 in that set , the direct problem ( [ transport ] ) has a unique solution @xmath66 for any @xmath67 , @xmath36 extends to a bounded operator from @xmath68 to @xmath69 , and    1 .",
    "the map @xmath36 is injective on @xmath70 , 2 .",
    "the following stability estimate holds @xmath71    with a constant @xmath58 locally uniform in @xmath50 .",
    "[ injectivetheorem ]    the proof of uniqueness and stability for the direct problem ( [ transport ] ) as stated in theorem [ injectivetheorem ] is essentially the same as the one contained in @xcite , so we will focus on the subtle differences .",

    "those covectors @xmath76 that can be detected will depend on @xmath38 in the following way :    the _ microlocally visible set _ corresponding to partial measurements on @xmath77 is given by @xmath78    here @xmath79 is the extension of @xmath80 to @xmath81 defined by @xmath82 .",

    "furthermore , the complete data operator @xmath30 , which is only a priori bounded when restricted to sufficiently smooth @xmath15 , extends to a bounded operator @xmath107 the proof of this relies on using the fact that @xmath108(x,\\theta ) = \\int_{-\\infty}^{0}\\exp\\left (   -\\int_{s}^{0}\\sigma(x + \\tau \\theta , \\theta)\\,d\\tau \\right)f(x + s\\theta,\\theta)\\,ds , \\label{t1inverse}\\ ] ] as well as fredholm theory applied to the resolvent @xmath109 .    in order to solve @xmath104 , we observe that @xmath110 , and so applying @xmath111 to both sides yields @xmath112 this is equivalent to the integral equation @xmath113 thus , if @xmath114 is invertible , we can solve the forward problem uniquely for @xmath115 to find @xmath2 such that @xmath116 exists , we note that @xmath117 and look at the operator @xmath118 it is shown in @xcite that the operator @xmath119 is compact , and for @xmath120 the resolvent ( [ resolvent2 ] ) exists . by the analytic fredholm theorem ( theorem vi.14 , @xcite ) , we have that @xmath121 is a meromorphic family of bounded operators with poles contained in a discrete set .",

    "let @xmath125 be some open subset .",

    "thus @xmath167    in the case that @xmath8 is @xmath0 , we would like to know where @xmath159 is elliptic .",
    "one can show using ( theorem 3.4 , @xcite ) that @xmath168 where @xmath169 we can now see that for @xmath39 @xmath170 is a pseudodifferential operator of order @xmath171 , since its kernel is weakly singular . more specifically ,",
