    "in spite of an unprecedented intensive experimental and theoretical study after the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) in cuprates there is , even twenty - three years after , no consensus on the pairing mechanism in these materials . at present",
    "there are two important experimental facts which are not under dispute : ( 1 ) the critical temperature @xmath4 in cuprates is high , with the maximum @xmath5 @xmath6 in the hg-1223 compounds ; ( 2 ) the pairing in cuprates is d - wave like , i.e. @xmath7 with @xmath8 . on the contrary",
    "there is a dispute concerning the scattering mechanism which governs normal state properties and pairing in cuprates . to this end",
    ", we stress that in the htsc cuprates , a number of properties can be satisfactorily explained by assuming that the quasi - particle dynamics is governed by some electron - boson scattering and in the superconducting state bosonic quasi - particles are responsible for cooper pairing .",
    "which bosonic quasi - particles are dominating in the cuprates is the subject which will be discussed in this work .",
    "it is known that the electron - boson ( phonon ) scattering is well described by the migdal - eliashberg theory if the adiabatic parameter @xmath9 @xmath10 fulfills the condition @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the electron - boson coupling constant , @xmath13 is the characteristic bosonic energy and @xmath14 is the electronic band width and @xmath15 depends on numerical approximations @xcite .",
    "the important characteristic of the electron - boson scattering is the eliashberg spectral function @xmath16 ( or its average @xmath17 ) which characterizes scattering of quasi - particle from @xmath18 to @xmath19 by exchanging bosonic energy @xmath20 .",
    "therefore , in systems with electron - boson scattering the knowledge of this function is of crucial importance .",
    "there are at least two approaches differing in assumed pairing bosons in the htsc cuprates .",
    "the _ first one _ is based on the electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) , with the main proponents in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where mediating bosons are _ phonons _ and where the average spectral function @xmath17 is similar to the phonon density of states @xmath21 .",
    "note , @xmath17 is not the product of two functions although sometimes one defines the function @xmath22 which should approximate the energy dependence of the strength of the epi coupling .",
    "there are numerous experimental evidence in cuprates for the importance of the epi scattering mechanism with a rather large coupling constant in the normal scattering channel @xmath3 , which will be discussed in detail below . in the epi approach @xmath23",
    "is extracted from tunnelling measurements in conjunction with ir optical measurements .",
    "we stress again that the migdal - eliashberg theory is well justified framework for epi since in most superconductors the condition @xmath24 is fulfilled .",
    "the htsc cuprates are on the borderline and it is a natural question - under which condition can high t@xmath25 be realized in the non - adiabatic limit @xmath26 ?",
    "the _ second approach _",
    "@xcite assumes that epi is too weak to be responsible for high @xmath4 in cuprates and it is based on a phenomenological model for spin - fluctuation interaction ( @xmath27 ) as the dominating scattering mechanism , i.e. it is a non - phononic mechanism . in this ( phenomenological ) approach the spectral function is proportional to the imaginary part of the spin susceptibility @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "nmr spectroscopy and magnetic neutron scattering give evidence that in htsc cuprates @xmath30 is peaked at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath31 and this property is very favorable for d - wave pairing .",
    "the @xmath27 theory roots basically on the strong electronic repulsion on cu atoms , which is usually studied by the hubbard model or its ( more popular ) derivative the t - j model . regarding the possibility to explain high t@xmath25 _ solely by strong correlations _",
    ", as it is reviewed in patricklee , we stress two facts .",
    "first , at present there is no viable theory as well as experimental facts which can justify these ( non - phononic ) mechanisms of pairing with some exotic pairing mechanism such as rvb pairing @xcite , fractional statistics and anyon superconductivity , etc .",
    "therefore we shall not discuss these , in theoretical sense , very interesting approaches .",
    "second , the central question in these non - phononic approaches is - do models based solely on the hubbard hamiltonian show up superconductivity at sufficiently high critical temperatures ( @xmath32 @xmath6 ) ?",
    "although the answer on this important question is not definitely settled there are a number of _ numerical studies _ of these models which offer rather convincing negative answers .",
    "for instance , the sign - free variational monte carlo algorithm in the 2d repulsive ( @xmath33 ) hubbard model gives _ _ no evidence for superconductivity with high t__@xmath25 , neither the bcs- nor berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt)-like @xcite . at the same time",
    ", similar calculations show that there is a strong tendency to superconductivity in the attractive ( @xmath34 ) hubbard model for the same strength of @xmath35 , i.e. at finite temperature in the 2d model with @xmath34 the bkt superconducting transition is favored . concerning the possibility of htsc in the @xmath36 model , various numerical calculations such as monte carlo calculations of the drude spectral weight @xcite and high temperature expansion for the pairing susceptibility @xcite",
    "have shown that there is no superconductivity at temperatures characteristic for cuprates and if it exists @xmath4 must be rather low - few kelvins .",
    "these numerical results tell us that the lack of high @xmath4  ( even in @xmath37 bkt phase ) in the repulsive ( @xmath33 )  single - band hubbard model and in the @xmath38 model is not only due to thermodynamical @xmath37-fluctuations ( which at finite t suppress and destroy superconducting phase coherence in large systems ) but it is mostly due to an _ inherent ineffectiveness of strong correlations to produce solely high _",
    "@xmath4 _ in cuprates_. these numerical results signal that the simple single - band hubbard and its derivative the t - j model are insufficient to explain solely the pairing mechanism in cuprates and some additional ingredients must be included .",
    "since @xmath2 is rather strong in cuprates , then it must be accounted for . as it will be argued in the following ,",
    "the experimental support for the importance of epi in cuprates comes from optics , tunnelling , and recent arpes measurements @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that recent arpes activity was a strong impetus for renewed experimental and theoretical studies of epi in cuprates .",
    "however , in spite of accumulating experimental evidence for importance of epi with @xmath39 , there are occasionally reports which doubt its importance in cuprates .",
    "this is the case with recent interpretation of some optical measurements in terms of sfi only @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and with lda - dft ( local density approximation - density functional theory ) band structure calculations @xcite , @xcite , where both claim that epi is negligibly small ,",
    "i.e. @xmath40 . the inappropriateness of these calculations will be discussed in the following sections .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in _",
    "part i _ we will mainly discuss experimental results in _ cuprates at and near optimal doping _ by giving also minimal theoretical explanations which are related to the _ _  bosonic spectral function _",
    "_ @xmath17 as well to the transport spectral function @xmath41 and their relations to epi .",
    "the reason that we study only cuprates at and near optimal doping is , that in these systems there are rather well defined quasi - particles - although strongly interacting , while in highly underdoped systems the superconductivity is perplexed and possibly masked by other phenomena , such as pseudogap effects , formation of small polarons , interaction with spin and ( possibly charge ) order parameters , pronounced inhomogeneities of the scattering centers , etc . as arpes experiments confirm there are no polaronic effects in systems at and near optimal doping , while there are pronounced polaronic effects due to epi in undoped and very underdoped htsc alexandrov , @xcite . in this work we consider mainly those direct one - particle and two - particles probes of low energy quasi - particle excitations and scattering rates which give information on the structure of the spectral functions @xmath42 and @xmath41 in systems near optimal doping .",
    "these are angle - resolved photoemission ( @xmath43 ) , various arts of tunnelling spectroscopy such as superconductor / insulator/ normal metal ( @xmath44 ) junctions and break junctions , scanning - tunnelling microscope spectroscopy ( @xmath45 ) , infrared ( @xmath46 ) and raman optics , inelastic neutron and x - ray scattering , etc .",
    "we shall argue that these direct probes give evidence for a rather strong epi in cuprates .",
    "some other experiments on epi are also discussed in order to complete the arguments for the importance of epi in cuprates .",
    "the detailed contents of part i is the following . in _ section ii",
    "_ we discuss some prejudices related to the strength of @xmath47 as well as on the fermi - liquid behavior of htsc cuprates .",
    "we argue that any non - phononic mechanism of pairing should have very large bare critical temperature @xmath48 in the presence of the large epi coupling constant , @xmath49 , if the epi spectral function is weakly momentum dependent , i.e. if @xmath50 like in low temperature superconductors .",
    "the fact that epi is large in the normal state of cuprates and the condition that it must conform with d - wave pairing implies inevitably that epi in cuprates must be _ strongly momentum dependent_. in _ section iii _ we discuss _ direct and indirect experimental evidence for the importance of epi _ in cuprates and for the weakness of sfi in cuprates .",
    "these are :    ( * a * ) _ magnetic neutron scattering _ _ measurements - _ these measurements provide dynamic spin susceptibility @xmath51 which is in the @xmath27 _ phenomenological approach",
    "_ pines related to the eliashberg spectral function , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "we stress that such an approach can be theoretically justified only in the weak coupling limit , @xmath53 , where @xmath14 is the band width and @xmath54 is the phenomenological sfi coupling constant . here",
    "we discuss experimental results on ybco which give evidence for strong rearrangement ( with respect to @xmath20 ) of @xmath55 ( with @xmath56 at and near @xmath57 ) by doping toward the optimal doped htsc @xcite , rezniknewimns .",
    "it turns out that in the optimally doped cuprates with @xmath58 @xmath6 @xmath59 is _ drastically suppressed _ compared to that in slightly underdoped ones with @xmath60 @xmath6 .",
    "this fact implies that the sfi coupling constant @xmath54 must be small .    *",
    "* _ optical conductivity _",
    "_ measurements _ - from these measurements one can extract the transport relaxation rate @xmath61 and indirectly an approximative shape of the transport spectral function @xmath41 . in the case of systems near optimal doping we discuss the following questions : ( i ) the physical and quantitative difference between the optical relaxation rate @xmath61 and the quasi - particle relaxation rate @xmath62 .",
    "it was shown in the past that by equating these two ( unequal ) quantities is dangerous and brings incorrect results concerning the quasi - particle dynamics in most metals by including htsc cuprates too maksimovreview , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; ( ii ) methods of extraction of the transport spectral function @xmath63 .",
    "although these methods give at finite temperature @xmath64 a blurred @xmath41 which is ( due to the ill - defined methods ) temperature dependent , it turns out that the width and the shape of the extracted @xmath63 are in favor of @xmath2 ; ( iii ) the restricted sum - rule for the optical weight as a function of @xmath64 which can be explained by strong @xmath2 @xcite , @xcite ; ( iv ) good agreement with experiments of the @xmath64-dependence of the resistivity @xmath65 in optimally doped ybco , where @xmath66 is calculated by using the spectral function from tunnelling experiments .",
    "recent femtosecond time - resolved optical spectroscopy in @xmath67 which gives additional evidence for importance of epi @xcite will be shortly discussed .",
    "* ( _ c _ ) * _ arpes _ _ measurements and epi _ - from these measurements the self - energy @xmath68 is extracted as well as some properties of @xmath42 . here",
    "we discuss the following items : ( i ) existence of the nodal and anti - nodal kinks in optimally and slightly underdoped cuprates , as well as the structure of the arpes self - energy ( @xmath69 ) and its isotope dependence , which are all due to epi ; ( ii ) appearance of different slopes of @xmath68 at low ( @xmath70 ) and high energies ( @xmath71 ) which can be explained by strong epi ; ( iii ) formation of small polarons in the undoped htsc was interpreted to be due to strong epi - this gives rise to phonon side bands which are clearly seen in arpes of undoped htsc gunnarssonreview2008 .",
    "( * d * ) _ tunnelling spectroscopy - _ it is well known that this method is of an immense importance in obtaining the spectral function @xmath72 from tunnelling conductance . in this part we discuss the following items : ( i ) the extracted eliashberg spectral function @xmath17 with the coupling constant @xmath73 from the tunnelling conductance of break - junctions in optimally doped ybco and bi-2212 @xcite-@xcite which gives that the maxima of @xmath17 coincide with the maxima in the phonon density of states @xmath74 ; ( ii ) existence of _ eleven peaks _ in @xmath75 in superconducting @xmath76 films @xcite , where these peaks match precisely with the peaks in the intensity of the existing phonon raman scattering data @xcite ; ( iii ) the presence of the dip in di / dv in stm which shows the pronounced oxygen isotope effect and important role of these phonons .    * ( _ e _ ) * _ inelastic _ _ neutron and x - ray scattering _ _ measurements _ - from these experiments one can extract the phonon density of state @xmath74 and in some cases strengths of the quasi - particle coupling with various phonon modes .",
    "these experiments give sufficient evidence for quantitative inadequacy of lda - dft calculations in htsc cuprates . here",
    "we argue , that the _ large softening and broadening _ of the half - breathing @xmath77 bond - stretching phonon , of apical oxygen phonons and of oxygen @xmath78 buckling phonons ( in lsco , bisco , ybco ) can not be explained by lda - dft .",
    "it is curious that the magnitude of the softening can be partially obtained by lda - dft but the calculated widths of some important modes are an order of magnitude smaller than the neutron scattering data show .",
    "this remarkable fact confirms additionally _ the _ _ inadequacy of lda - dft in strongly correlated systems _ and a more sophisticated many body theory for epi is needed .",
    "the problem of epi will be discussed in more details in _ part ii _ .    in _ section iv _",
    "brief summary of the _",
    "part i _ is given . since _ we are dealing with electron - boson scattering in cuprate near optimal doping _",
    ", then in _ appendix _ _ a _ ( and in part ii ) we introduce the reader briefly into the migdal - eliashberg theory for superconductors ( and normal metals ) where the quasi - particle spectral function @xmath79 and the transport spectral function @xmath41 are defined .    finally , one can pose a question - do the experimental results of the above enumerated spectroscopic methods allow a building of a satisfactory and physically reasonable microscopic theory for basic scattering and pairing mechanism in cuprates ?",
    "the posed question is very modest compared with a much stringent request for the _ theory of everything _ - which would be able to explain all properties of htsc materials .",
    "such an ambitious project is not realized even in those low - temperature conventional superconductors where it is definitely proved that in most materials the pairing is due to epi and many properties are well accounted for by the migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "let us mention only two examples : - first , the experimental value for the coherence peak in the microwave response @xmath80 at @xmath81 @xmath82 in the superconducting @xmath83 is much higher than the theoretical value obtained by the strong coupling eliashberg theory @xcite .",
    "so to say , the theory explains the coherence peak at @xmath84 @xmath82 in @xmath85 qualitatively but not quantitatively . however , the measurements at higher frequency @xmath86 @xmath82 are in agreement with the eliashberg theory @xcite",
    ". then one can say that instead of the theory of everything we deal with a satisfactory theory , which allows us qualitative and in many aspects quantitative explanation of phenomena in superconducting state .",
    "- second example is the experimental boron ( b ) isotope effect in @xmath87 ( @xmath88 @xmath6 ) which is much smaller than the theoretical value , i.e. @xmath89 , although the pairing is due solely by epi for boron vibrations @xcite . since the theory of everything is impossible in the complex materials such as htsc cuprates in",
    "part i _ we shall not discuss those phenomena which need much more microscopic details and/or more sophisticated many - body theory .",
    "these are selected by chance : ( _ i _ ) large ratio @xmath90 which is on optimally doped ybco and bisco @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively , while in underdoped bisco one has even @xmath93 ; ( _ ii _ ) peculiarities of the coherence peak in the microwave response @xmath94 in htsc cuprates , which is peaked at @xmath64 much smaller than @xmath4 , contrary to the case of ltsc where it occurs near @xmath4 ; ( _ iii _ ) the dependence of @xmath4 on the number of @xmath95 in the unit cell ; ( _ iv _ ) temperature dependence of the hall coefficient ; ( _ v _ ) distribution of states in the vortex core , etc .",
    "the microscopic theory of the mechanism for superconducting pairing in htsc cuprates will be discussed in _",
    "_ in section v we introduce an _ ab initio many - body theory _ of superconductivity which is based on the fundamental ( microscopic ) hamiltonian and the many - body technique .",
    "this theory can in principle calculate measurable properties of materials such as the critical temperature @xmath4 , critical fields , dynamic and transport properties , etc . however , although this method is in principle exact , which needs only some fundamental constants @xmath96 and the chemical composition of superconducting materials , it was practically never realized in practice due to the complexity of many - body interactions - electron - electron and electron - lattice , as well as of structural properties .",
    "fortunately , the problem can be simplified by using the fact that superconductivity is a low - energy phenomenon characterized by _ very small energy parameters _",
    "@xmath98 @xmath99 .",
    "it turns out , that one can integrate high - energy electronic processes ( which are not changed by the appearance of superconductivity ) and then solve the _ _  low - energy problem _ _ by the ( so called ) strong - coupling migdal - eliashberg theory .",
    "it turns out that in such an approach the physics is separated into : ( 1 ) solving an _ ideal band - structure hamiltonian with the nonlocal exact crystal potential _ ( sometimes called excitation potential ) @xmath100 ( @xmath101 - _ ideal band structure _ ) which includes the static self - energy ( @xmath102 ) due to high - energy electronic processes , i.e. @xmath103\\delta ( \\mathbf{r}-\\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } ) + \\sigma _ { c0}^{(h)}(\\mathbf{r},% \\mathbf{r}^{\\prime } , \\omega = 0)$ ] , with @xmath104 , @xmath105 the electron - ion and hartree potential , respectively ; ( 2 ) solving the low - energy eliashberg equations .",
    "however , the calculation of the ( excited ) potential @xmath106 and the real epi coupling @xmath107 , which include high - energy many - body electronic processes - for instance large hubbard u effects , is extremely difficult at present , especially in strongly correlated systems such as htsc cuprates . due to this difficulty",
    "the calculations of the epi coupling in the past was usually based on the lda - dft method which will be discussed in section vi in the contest of htsc cuprates , where the nonlocal potential is replaced by the _ local potential _ @xmath108 - the ground state potential , and the real epi coupling by the `` local '' lda one @xmath109 . since the exchange - correlation effects enter @xmath110 via the local exchange - correlation potential @xmath111 it is clear that the lda - dft method describes strong correlations scarcely and it is inadequate in htsc cuprates ( and other strongly correlated systems such as heavy fermions ) wher one needs an approach beyond the lda - dft method . in section",
    "vii we discuss a _ minimal theoretical model _ for htsc cuprates which takes into account a minimal number of electronic orbitals and strong correlations in a controllable manner @xcite .",
    "this theory treats the _ interplay of epi and strong correlations _ in systems with finite doping in a systematic and controllable way .",
    "the minimal model can be further reduced in some parameter range to the single - band @xmath36 model , which allows the approximative calculation of the excited potential @xmath112 and the non - local epi coupling @xmath113 . as a result",
    "one obtains the momentum dependent epi coupling @xmath114 which is for small hole - doping ( @xmath115 ) strongly peaked at small transfer momenta ( more precisely at @xmath116 ) - the _ forward scattering peak_. in the framework of this minimal model it is possible to explain some important properties and resolve some puzzling experimental results , for instance : * * ( * * _ _ a ) _ _ why is d - wave pairing realized in the presence of strong epi ? * * ( * * _ _ b _ _ * ) * why is the transport coupling constant ( @xmath117 ) rather smaller than the pairing one @xmath118 , i.e. @xmath119 ? ( _ c _ ) why is the mean - field ( one - body ) lda - dft approach unable to give reliable values for the epi coupling constant in cuprates and how many - body effects help ; ( _ d _ ) why is d - wave pairing robust in the presence of non - magnetic impurities and defects ?",
    "( e ) why are the arpes nodal and antinodal kinks differently renormalized in the superconducting states , etc ? in spite of the encouraging successes of this minimal model , at least in a qualitative explanation of numerous important properties of htsc cuprates , we are still at present stage far from a fully microscopic theory of htsc cuprates which is able to explain high @xmath4 . in that respect at the and of section vii we discuss possible improvements of the present minimal model in order to obtain at least a semi - quantitative theory for htsc cuprates .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that in real htsc materials there are numerous experimental evidence for nanoscale inhomogeneities .",
    "for instance recent stm experiments show rather large gap dispersion at least on the surface of bisco crystals @xcite giving rise for a pronounced inhomogeneity of the superconducting order parameter , i.e. @xmath120 where @xmath18 is the relative momentum of the cooper pair and @xmath121 is the center of mass of cooper pairs .",
    "one possible reason for the inhomogeneity of @xmath122 and disorder on the atomic scale can be due to extremely high doping level of @xmath123 @xmath124 in htsc cuprates which is many orders of magnitude larger than in standard semiconductors ( @xmath125 vs @xmath126 carrier concentration ) .",
    "there are some claims that high @xmath4 is exclusively due to these inhomogeneities ( of an extrinsic or intrinsic origin ) which may effectively increase pairing potential @xcite , while some others try to explain high @xmath4 solely within the inhomogeneous hubbard or @xmath36 model . here",
    "we shall not discuss this interesting problem but mention only that the concept of t@xmath25 increase by inhomogeneity is ill - defined , since the increase of @xmath4 is defined with respect to the average value @xmath127 .",
    "however , @xmath128 is experimentally not well defined quantity and the hypothesis of an increase of @xmath4 by material inhomogeneities can not be tested at all . in studying and analyzing _ htsc cuprates near optimal doping",
    "_ we assume that basic effects are realized in nearly homogeneous systems and inhomogeneities are of secondary role , which deserve to be studied and discussed separately .",
    "concerning the high @xmath4 in cuprates , two dilemmas have been dominating after its discovery : ( _ i _ ) which interaction is responsible for strong quasi - particle scattering in the normal state - this question is related also to the dilemma fermi vs non - fermi liquid ; ( _ ii _ ) what is the mediating ( gluing ) boson responsible for the superconducting pairing , i.e. there is a dilemma _ phonons or non - phonons _ ?",
    "in the last twenty - three years , the scientific community was overwhelmed by numerous proposed pairing mechanisms , most of which are hardly verifiable in htsccuprates .",
    "fermi vs non - fermi liquid in cuprates _",
    "after discovery of htsc in cuprates there was a large amount of evidence on strong scattering of quasi - particles which contradicts the canonical ( popular but narrow ) definition of the fermi liquid , thus giving rise to numerous proposals of the so called non - fermi liquids , such as luttinger liquid , rvb theory , marginal fermi liquid , etc . in our opinion there is no need for these radical approaches in explaining basic physics in cuprates at least _ in optimally , slightly underdoped and overdoped _ metallic and superconducting htsc cuprates .",
    "here we give some clarifications related to the dilemma of fermi vs non - fermi liquid .",
    "the definition of the _ canonical fermi liquid _ ( based on the landau work ) in interacting fermi systems comprises the following properties : ( 1 ) there are quasi - particles with charge @xmath129 , spin @xmath130 and low - laying energy excitations @xmath131 which are much larger than their inverse life - times , i.e. @xmath132 . since the level width @xmath133 of the quasi - particle is negligibly small , this means that the excited states of the fermi liquid are placed in one - to - one correspondence with the excited states of the free fermi gas ; ( 2 ) at @xmath134 @xmath6 there is an energy level with the fermi surface at which @xmath135 and the fermi quasi - particle distribution function @xmath136 has finite jump at @xmath137 ; ( 3 ) the number of quasi - particles under the fermi surface is equal to the total number of conduction particles ( we omit here other valence and core electrons ) - the luttinger theorem ; ( 4 ) the interaction between quasi - particles are characterized with a few ( landau ) parameters which describe low - temperature thermodynamics and transport properties . having this definition in mind",
    "one can say that if fermionic quasi - particles interact with some bosonic excitation , for instance with phonons , and if the coupling is sufficiently strong , then the former are not described by the canonical fermi liquid since at energies and temperatures of the order of the characteristic ( debye ) temperature @xmath138 ( for the debye spectrum @xmath139 ) , i.e. for @xmath140 one has @xmath141 and the quasi - particle picture ( in the sense of the landau definition ) is broken down . in that respect",
    "an electron - boson system can be classified as a _ non - canonical fermi liquid _ for sufficiently strong electron - boson coupling .",
    "it is nowadays well known that for instance al , zn are weak coupling systems since for @xmath142 one has @xmath143 and they are well described by the landau theory .",
    "however , in ( the non - canonical ) cases , where for higher energies @xmath144 one has @xmath145 , the electron - phonon system is satisfactory described by the _ migdal - eliashberg theory and the boltzmann theory _",
    ", where thermodynamic and transport properties depend on the spectral function @xmath146 and its higher momenta .",
    "since in htsc cuprates the electron - boson ( phonon ) coupling is strong and @xmath4 is large , i.e. of the order of characteristic boson energies ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath147 , then it is natural that in the normal state ( at @xmath148 @xmath4 ) we deal with a strong interacting non - canonical fermi liquid which is for modest non - adiabaticity parameter @xmath24 described by the migdal - eliashberg theory , at least qualitatively and semi - quantitatively . in order to justify this statement we shall in the following",
    "elucidate some properties in more details by studying optical , arpes , tunnelling and other experiments in htsc oxides .    _",
    "2_. _ is there limitation of the strength of epi ? _    in spite of reach experimental evidence in favor of strong epi in htsc oxides there was a disproportion in the research activity ( especially theoretical ) in the past , since the investigation of the sfi mechanism of pairing prevailed in the literature .",
    "this trend was partly due to an incorrect statement in @xcite on the possible upper limit of t@xmath25 in the phonon mechanism of pairing .",
    "since in the past we have discussed this problem thoroughly in numerous papers - for the recent one see maksimovdolgov2007 , we shall outline here the main issue and results only .",
    "it is well known that in an electron - ion crystal , besides the attractive epi , there is also repulsive coulomb interaction . in case of an isotropic and homogeneous system with weak quasi - particle interaction , the effective potential @xmath149 in the leading approximation",
    "looks like as for two external charges ( @xmath150 ) embedded in the medium with the _ total longitudinal dielectric function _",
    "@xmath151 ( @xmath18 is the momentum and @xmath20 is the frequency ) @xcite , @xcite , i.e. @xmath152 in case of strong interaction between quasi - particles , the state of embedded quasi - particles changes significantly due to interaction with other quasi - particles , giving rise to @xmath153 . in that case @xmath154 depends on other ( than @xmath155 ) response functions .",
    "however , in the case when eq.([veff ] ) holds , i. e. when the weak - coupling limit is realized , @xmath4 is given by @xmath156 @xcite , ginzburg , @xcite .",
    "here , @xmath157 is the epi coupling constant , @xmath158 is an average phonon frequency and @xmath159 is the coulomb pseudo - potential , @xmath160 ( @xmath161 is the fermi energy ) .",
    "the couplings @xmath157 and @xmath162 are expressed by @xmath163 @xmath164@xmath165where @xmath166 is the density of states at the fermi surface and @xmath137 is the fermi momentum - see more in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was claimed that lattice stability of the system with respect to the charge density wave formation implies the condition @xmath167 for all @xmath18 .",
    "if this were correct then from eq.(nveff ) it follows that @xmath168 , which limits the maximal value of t@xmath25 to the value @xmath169 . in typical metals",
    "@xmath170 @xmath171 and if one accepts the statement in @xcite that @xmath172 , one obtains @xmath173 @xmath6 .  the latter result , if it would be correct , means that epi is ineffective in producing not only high - t@xmath25 superconductivity but also low - temperature superconductivity ( lts with @xmath174 @xmath6 ) . however , this result is in conflict first of all with experimental results in ltsc , where in numerous systems one has @xmath175 and @xmath39 .",

    "_ first _ , in some reports @xcite , @xcite , @xcite it is assumed that @xmath463 of cuprates can be extracted also in the superconducting state by using eq . (",
    "[ spect - func ] ) . however , eq . ( spect - func ) holds exclusively in the normal state ( at @xmath134 ) since @xmath354 can be described by the generalized ( extended ) drude formula in eq .",

    "such an approach does not hold in the superconducting state since the dynamical conductivity depends not only on the electron - boson scattering but also on coherence factors and on the momentum and energy dependent order parameter @xmath481 .",
    "in such a case it is unjustified to extract @xmath468 from eq .",
    "( [ spect - func ] ) .",
    "_ second _ , if @xmath348 ( and @xmath354 ) in cuprates are due to some other bosonic scattering which is pronounced up to much higher energies @xmath482 , this should be seen in the extracted spectral function @xmath468 .",
    "such an assumption is made , for instance , in the phenomenological spin - fluctuation approach @xcite where it is assumed that @xmath483im@xmath484 where im@xmath485 is extended up to the large energy cutoff @xmath486 @xmath266 .",
    "this assumption is in conflict with the above theoretical and experimental analysis which shows that solely epi can describe @xmath348 very well and that the contribution from higher energies @xmath487 must be small and therefore irrelevant for pairing @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the finding of the importance of epi is also confirmed by tunnelling measurements - see discussion in subsection d. despite the experimentally established facts , that the energy width of the extracted @xmath463 coincides with the phononic range , which favor epi , some reports appeared recently claiming that sfi dominates and that @xmath488 where @xmath489 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this claim is based on reanalyzing of some ir measurements @xcite , @xcite and the transport spectral function @xmath468 is extracted in hwangtimusk1 by using the maximum entropy method in solving the fredholm equation .",
    "however , in order to exclude negative values in the extracted @xmath490 , which is an artefact and due to the chosen method , in @xcite it is assumed that @xmath468 has a rather large tail at large energies - up to 400 mev .",
    "it turns out that even such an assumption in extracting @xmath470 does not reproduce the experimental curve @xmath491 @xcite in some important respects : ( _ i _ ) the relative heights of the two peaks in the extracted spectral function @xmath490 at lower temperatures are opposite to the experimental curve @xmath336 @xcite - see fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "( _ ii _ ) the strong temperature dependence of the extracted @xmath468 found in @xcite , @xcite is in fact not an intrinsic property of the spectral function but it is an artefact due to the high sensitivity of the extraction procedure on temperature . as it is already explained before , this is due to the ill - posed problem of solving the fredholm integral equation of the first kind with strong @xmath64-dependent kernel .",
    "_ third _ , in fact the extracted spectral weight @xmath492 in hwangtimusk1 has much smaller values at larger frequencies ( @xmath493 @xmath494 ) than it is the case for the measured im@xmath485 , i.e. @xmath495 @xmath496 @xmath497 - see fig . 1 in @xcite .",
    "_ fourth _ , the recent magnetic neutron scattering measurements on optimally - doped _ large - volume _ crystals @xmath498 @xcite ( where the absolute value of @xmath499 is measured ) are not only questioning the theoretical interpretation of magnetism in htsc cuprates in terms of itinerant magnetism but they also oppose the finding in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "this experiment shows that the local spin susceptibility @xmath500 is temperature independent across the superconducting transition @xmath60 @xmath6 , i.e there is only a minimal change in @xmath336 between @xmath337 @xmath6 and @xmath338 @xmath6 .",
    "this @xmath64-independence of @xmath336 strongly opposes the ( above discussed ) results in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , where the fit of optic measurements give strong @xmath64-dependence of @xmath501 .",

    "one has @xmath504 this would probably give @xmath505 what is not confirmed by other experiments .",
    "_ sixth _ , the interpretation of @xmath468 in lsco and bisco solely in terms of im@xmath485 is in contradiction with the magnetic neutron scattering in the optimally doped and slightly underdoped ybco @xcite .",
    "the latter was discussed in  subsection a , where it is shown that im@xmath506 is small in the normal state and its magnitude is even below the experimental noise .",
    "this means that if the assumption that @xmath507im@xmath485 were correct then the contribution to im@xmath485 from the momenta @xmath508 would be dominant which is very detrimental for d - wave superconductivity .",
    "finally , we point out that very similar ( to cuprates ) properties , of @xmath509 , @xmath348 ( and @xmath65 and electronic raman spectra ) were observed in 3d isotropic metallic oxides @xmath510 and @xmath511 which are non - superconducting @xcite and in @xmath512 which superconducts below @xmath513 @xmath6 at @xmath514 .",

    "the effects of the charge vertex on @xmath1085 and @xmath1086 are differently manifested .",
    "namely , the vertex function enters _ quadratically _ in @xmath1087 and the presence of the forward scattering peak in the charge vertex _ strongly affects _ the epi coupling constant @xmath1041 in @xmath1084@xmath1088where @xmath1089 is the quasi - particle green s function , @xmath1090 is the quasi - particle vertex and @xmath1091 is the hubbard quasi - particle spectral weight - see part ii , section vii .",
    "in the adiabatic limit @xmath1092 one has @xmath1093 and for @xmath1094 the charge vertex is strongly suppressed ( @xmath1095 ) making the effective epi coupling ( which also enters the pairing potential ) small at large ( transfer ) momenta @xmath56 .",
    "this has strong repercussion on the pairing due to epi since for small doping it makes the d - wave pairing coupling constant to be of the order of the s - one ( @xmath1096 ) .",
    "then in the presence of the residual coulomb interaction epi gives rise to d - wave pairing .",
    "on the other side the charge vertex @xmath1097 enters @xmath1042 _ linearly _ and it is _ additionally integrated _ over the quasi - particle momentum @xmath1098- see eq.([el - pol ] ) . therefore",

    "nevertheless , the peak of @xmath1097 at @xmath1075 may be ( partly ) responsible that the maximal experimental softening and broadening of the stretching ( half - breading ) mode in @xmath998 and @xmath1100is at @xmath1045 @xcite and not at @xmath1101 for which @xmath1102 reaches maximum .",
    "this means that the charge vertex function pushes the renormalized epi coupling constant to smaller @xmath56 .",
    "it would be very interesting to have calculations for other phonons by including the vertex function obtained by the x - method - see section.vii      the _ phonon _ raman scattering gives an indirect evidence for importance of epi in cuprates @xcite , @xcite , hadjiev .",
    "we enumerate some of them - see more in @xcite and references therein .",
    "( i ) there is a pronounced _ asymmetric line - shape _ ( of the fano resonance ) in the metallic state .",

    "this asymmetry means that there is an appreciable interaction of raman active phonons with continuum states ( quasi - particles ) .",

    "we mention that there is a remarkable correlation between the electronic raman cross - section @xmath1111 and the optical conductivity in the @xmath938 plane @xmath354 , i.e. @xmath1112 @xcite .",
    "in previous subsections it is argued that epi with the very broad spectral function @xmath17 ( @xmath1113 @xmath266 ) explains in a natural way the @xmath20 and @xmath566 dependence of @xmath1114 .",
    "this means that the electronic raman spectra in cuprates can be explained by epi in conjunction with strong correlations .",
    "this conclusion is supported by calculations of the raman cross - section @xcite which take into account epi with @xmath0 extracted from tunnelling measurements in @xmath260 and @xmath1115 @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "quite similar properties ( to cuprates ) of the electronic raman scattering , as well as of @xmath1116 , @xmath348 and @xmath65 , were observed in experiments @xcite on isotropic 3d metallic oxides @xmath510 and @xmath511 where there are no signs of antiferromagnetic fluctuations .",
    "this means that low - dimensionality and antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations can not be a prerequisite for anomalous scattering of quasi - particles and epi must be inevitably taken into account since it is present in all these compounds .",
    "the isotope effect @xmath1118 in the critical temperature @xmath4 was one of the very important proof for the epi pairing in low - temperature superconductors ( ltsc ) .",
    "as a curiosity the isotope effect in @xmath930 systems was measured almost exclusively in mono - atomic systems and in few polyatomic systems : the hydrogen isotope effect in @xmath1119 , the @xmath1120 and @xmath1121 isotope shift of @xmath4 in @xmath1122 , and the isotope effect in @xmath1123 and @xmath87 .",
    "we point out that very small ( @xmath1124 in @xmath1125 and @xmath1126 ) and even negative ( in @xmath1119 ) isotope effect in some polyatomic systems of @xmath930 materials are compatible with the @xmath2 pairing mechanism but in the presence of substantial coulomb interaction or lattice anharmonicity .",
    "the isotope effect @xmath1118cannot be considered as the smoking gun effect since it is sensitive to numerous influences .",

    "the situation in htsc cuprates is much more complicated because they are _ strongly correlated systems and contain many - atoms in unit cell_. additionally , the situation is complicated with the presence of _ intrinsic and extrinsic inhomogeneities , low dimensionality _ which can mask the isotope effects . on the other hand new techniques such as arpes , stm ,",
    "@xmath1128 allow studies of the isotope effects in quasi - particle self - energies , i.e. @xmath1129 , which will be discussed below .",
    "this problem will be discussed only briefly since more extensive discussion can be found in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in the pure epi pairing mechanism , the total isotope coefficient @xmath1131 is given by @xmath1132 , where @xmath1133 is the mass of the i - th element in the @xmath918-th crystallographic position .",
    "we stress that the total isotope effect is not measured in htsc cuprates but only some partial ones .",
    "note , that in the case when the screened coulomb interaction is negligible , i.e. @xmath1134 , the theory predicts @xmath1135 . from this formula",

    "this means that measurements of @xmath1143 for heavier elements are at / or beyond the ability of present day experimental techniques .",
    "therefore most isotope effect measurements were done by substituting light atoms @xmath1144 by @xmath1145 only .",

    "hence the small oxygen isotope effect @xmath1176 in optimally doped cuprates , if it is an intrinsic property at all ( due to pronounced local inhomogeneities of samples and quasi - two dimensionality of the system ) , does not exclude the epi mechanism of pairing .",
    "the fine structure of the quasi - particle self - energy @xmath1178 , such as kinks and slopes , can be resolved in arpes measurements and in some respect in stm .",

    "this value is significantly larger than the lda - dft theory predicts @xmath1200 @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this again points that the _ lda - dft method does not pick up the many - body effects _ due to strong correlations- see part ii .",
    "the analysis of experimental data in htsc cuprates which are related to optics , tunnelling and arpes measurements _ near and at the optimal doping _ give evidence for the large electron - phonon interaction ( epi ) with the coupling constant @xmath1201 .",
    "we stress that this analysis is done in the framework of the migdal - eliashberg theory for epi which is a reliable approach for systems near the optimal doping .",
    "the spectral function @xmath17 , averaged over the fermi surface , is extracted from various tunnelling measurements on bulk materials and tin films .",
    "it contains peaks at the same energies as the phonon density of states @xmath74 .",
    "so obtained spectral function when inserted in the eliashberg equations provides sufficient strength for obtaining high critical temperature t@xmath1202 @xmath6 .",
    "these facts are a solid proof for the important role of epi in the normal state scattering and pairing mechanism of cuprates .",
    "such a large ( experimental ) value of the epi coupling constant and the robustness of the d - wave superconductivity in the presence of impurities imply that the epi and impurity scattering amplitude must be strongly momentum dependent .",
    "the ir optical reflectivity data provide additional support for the importance of epi since by using the spectral function ( extracted from tunnelling measurements ) one can quantitatively explain frequency dependence of the dynamical conductivity , optical relaxation rate and optical mass .",
    "these findings related to epi are additionally supported by arpes measurements on bisco compounds .",
    "the arpes kinks , the phononic features and isotope effect in the quasi - particle self - energy in the nodal and anti - nodal points at low energies ( @xmath1203 ) persist in the normal and superconducting state .",

    "the transport epi coupling constant in htsc cuprates is much smaller than @xmath157 , i.e. @xmath1204 , which points to some peculiar scattering mechanism not met in low - temperature superconductors .",
    "the different renormalization of the quasi - particle and transport self - energies by the coulomb interaction ( strong correlations ) hints to the importance of the small - momentum scattering in epi .",
    "this will be discussed in _",
    "part ii_.    the ineffectiveness of sfi to solely provide pairing mechanism in cuprates comes out also from magnetic neutron scattering on ybco , bisco . as a result ,",
    "the imaginary part of the susceptibility is drastically reduced in the low energy region by going from slightly underdoped toward optimally doped systems , while @xmath4 is practically unchanged .",
    "this implies that the real sfi coupling constant @xmath275 is small since the experimental value @xmath1205 @xmath171 is much smaller than the assumed theoretical value @xmath1206 @xmath171 .",
    "inelastic neutron and x - ray scattering measurements in cuprates show that the broadening of some phonon lines is by an order of magnitude larger than the lda - dfa methods predict .",
    "since the phonon line - widths depend on the epi coupling and the charge susceptibility it is evident that calculations of both quantities are beyond the range of applicability of lda - dft . as a consequence ,",
    "lda - dft overestimates electronic screening and thus underestimates the epi coupling , since many - body effects due to strong correlations are not contained in this mean - field type theory .",
    "however , in spite of the promising and encouraging experimental results about the dominance of epi in cuprates the theory is still confronted with difficulties in explaining sufficiently large coupling constant in the d - channel . at present",
    "there is no such a satisfactory microscopic theory although some concepts , such as the the dominant epi scattering at small transfer momenta , are understood at least qualitatively .",

    "epi must be peaked at small transfer momenta_. a number of other experiments in htsc cuprates give evidence that these are _ strongly correlated systems _ with large on - site coulomb repulsion of electrons on the cu - ions__. _ _ however , at present there is no satisfactory microscopic theory of pairing in htsc  cuprates which is capable to calculate @xmath4 and the order parameter .",
    "this is due to mathematical difficulties in obtaining a solution of the formally exact _ ab initio many - body equations _ which take into account two important ingredients - epi and strong correlations @xcite . in section",
    "v we discuss first the ab initio many body theory of superconductivity in order to point places which are most difficult to be solved . since the superconductivity is low energy phenomenon ( also in htsc cuprates ) one can simplify the structure of the ab initio equations in the low - energy sector ( the migdal - eliashberg theory ) where the high - energy processes are incorporated in the ( so called ) _ ideal band structure _ ( non - local ) potential @xmath1207 and _ vertex functions _ @xmath1208 . due to its complexity this program of calculation of @xmath1209 , @xmath1210 , epi couplings @xmath1211",

    "we shall discuss such a systematic and controllable theory in the framework of  the @xmath36 model with @xmath2 , which is formulated and solved in terms of hubbard operators .",
    "the theory of this ( toy ) model predicts some interesting effects which might be important for understanding the physics of htsc cuprates .",
    "it predicts that the high - energy processes ( due to the suppression of doubly occupancy for @xmath1215 ) give rise to a nonlocal contribution to the band structure potential ( self - energy @xmath1216 ) as well as to epi .",
    "this non - locality in epi is responsible for the peak in the effective pairing potential ( @xmath1217 ) at small transfer momenta @xmath914(@xmath1218 ) @xcite , kulic1 , @xcite .",
