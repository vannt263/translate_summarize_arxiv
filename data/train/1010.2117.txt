    "the experimental realization @xcite of an on - demand , high - frequency , single - electron source ( ses ) makes it possible to inject into a solid state circuit single particles , electrons and holes , in a controllable way . using several uncorrelated single - electron sources mesoscopic circuits",
    "were proposed which permit to vary the amount of fermionic - correlations @xcite and to produce controllably orbitally entangled pair of particles @xcite .",
    "similar high - frequency sources of single electrons were realized using dynamical quantum dots without @xcite or with a perpendicular magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the principal advantage of on - demand , single - electron sources over the usually used metallic contacts ( mcs ) as electron sources is the possibility , in the former case , to switch on and off quantum correlations between particles initially emitted from uncorrelated sources .",
    "an example of correlations generated by normal metallic contacts is the two - particle aharonov - bohm effect in the solid state hanbury brown - twiss interferometer discussed theoretically @xcite and found experimentally @xcite .",
    "in contrast , with single - electron sources the two - particle interferometer , as it is discussed in ref . , can show or not show the aharonov - bohm effect depending on whether sources are driven in synchronism or not .",
    "the appearance of quantum correlations ( fermionic , in the case of electrons ) between initially uncorrelated particles is due to the overlap of wave - packets on the wave splitter . for electrons in solid state circuits",
    "the splitter is a quantum point contact ( qpc ) , ( see fig.[fig1 ] , the qpc labeled @xmath0 ) .",
    "such correlations are well known in optics , see , e.g. , ref .. the overlap of fermions was discussed in ref .",
    "and in ref .. the overlap depends on the spatial extend of wave - packets and also on the times when they arrive at the wave splitter .",
    "thus the resulting correlations can be used to access information about the space - time extend of quantum states . for mcs",
    "working as electron sources such information is rather hidden since the mentioned correlations are always present .",
    "in contrast with on - demand single - electron sources control of the emission time can be achieved , i.e. the appearance or disappearance of correlations can be controlled .",
    "thus with such sources the space time extend of quantum states becomes accessible",
    ".    in mesoscopics physics shot noise @xcite is the natural quantity that can be used to find information on two - particle correlations .",
    "@xcite the shot noise of carriers emitted by two ses s is suppressed if the wave - packets overlap at the qpc connecting edge states in which emitted particles propagate .",
    "@xcite if two sources are identical and they emit particles at the same time , the emitted particles are in identical quantum states and the shot noise is suppressed down to zero .",
    "this effect is similar to the hong - ou - mandel effect in optics @xcite with the evident difference that electrons are rather forced go into different output channels while photons are bunched into the same output channel .",
    "the aim of this paper is to use the shot noise suppression as a spectroscopic tool allowing comparison of the quantum states emitted by the different electron sources . as the test state",
    "we will use the one emitted by the ses .",
    "the ses is made of a quantum capacitor @xcite in the quantum hall effect regime .",
    "the ses is connected to one of the arms of the mesoscopic electron collider , fig.[fig1 ] . under the action of a potential @xmath1 periodic in time",
    "the ses emits a sequence of alternating electrons and holes .",
    "@xcite in a certain range of amplitudes , in the quantized emission regime , the ses emits one electron and one hole . at low driving frequency , in the adiabatic regime ,",
    "the emitted state by the ses is close to the state generated by voltage pulses of lorentzian form with a time integral equal to a flux quantum : such a quantized voltage pulse produces a single - particle state on top of the fermi sea . @xcite . in the second arm we put the source of interest and investigate the resulting shot noise .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.[sec1 ] we calculate the zero - frequency cross - correlator of currents flowing into two outputs in the collider circuit with a ses in one input and a biased metallic contact in other one . in sec.[sec2 ] we address the effect of stochastic single - particle emitters which emit or do not emit a particle in a given period that arrives at the qpc .",
    "we demonstrate the irrelevance of such stochastic emission to the shot noise suppression effect . in sec.[sec3 ]",
    "the shot noise suppression effect is found for colliding single- and two - electron pulses .",
    "a discussion of our results is given in sec.[concl ] .",
    "much of the analysis is grouped into three appendices . in appendix[app1 ] we present a detailed model of a single electron source . in appendix[app2 ] we calculate a current correlation function for a periodically driven mesoscopic scatterer connected to reservoirs biased with periodic voltages . in appendix[app3 ] the zero - frequency cross - correlation function for a circuit with two sess is expressed it terms of single- and two - particle probabilities .",
    "we consider an electron collider with a ses in one branch and a mc with a potential @xmath2 periodic in time in another branch , see , fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the potential @xmath3 driving the ses and @xmath4 have the same period , @xmath5 , which is assumed to be large enough to consider adiabatic transport and neglect relaxation and decoherence processes @xcite relevant for high - energy excitations .",
    "in addition the mc is biased with a constant potential @xmath6 with respect to the other contacts which all have the same chemical potential @xmath7 .",
    "the temperature is taken to be zero .",
    "we utilize the scattering matrix approach @xcite to transport in mesoscopic systems and describe this circuit with the help of the frozen scattering matrix    @xmath8     + with @xmath9 the scattering amplitude of the ses , see appendix [ app1 ] , eq.([07_nsc_03_1 ] ) , @xmath10 the reflection / transmission amplitude for the central quantum point contact @xmath0 , and @xmath11 the length from the ses ( @xmath12 ) or the mc ( @xmath13 ) to the contact @xmath14 where the corresponding current @xmath15 is measured . at zero temperature",
    "we need all quantities at the fermi energy @xmath7 only .",
    "we are interested in the zero - frequency correlation function @xcite @xmath16 of the currents @xmath17 and @xmath18 flowing into the contacts @xmath19 and @xmath20 , see fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the corresponding calculations are presented in appendix [ app2 ] . in the adiabatic regime and at zero temperature",
    "we have , @xmath21 , eq.([ac15_1 ] ) :    @xmath22     + where @xmath23 is the shot noise@xcite produced by one particle ( either an electron or a hole ) emitted by the ses during the period @xmath24 .",
    "the oscillating potential at contact @xmath20 appears in the form of a phase factor @xmath25 which multiplies the scattering amplitude of the ses .",
    "the symbol @xmath26 indicates the q - th fourier component ( in time ) of these two amplitudes .",
    "( [ 01 ] ) illustrates that the correlation tests the coherence properties of the two sources .",
    "note the decoherence processes , which we neglect in the present work , can lead to suppression of coherence      with a voltage pulse of lorentzian shape and a time integral quantized to a single flux quantum  @xcite one can excite an electron from a fermi sea without any other disturbance to the fermi sea .",
    "the state for an excited electron has a lorentzian density profile ( the time - dependent current is a lorentzian pulse ) which is similar to the one @xcite emitted by the ses in the adiabatic regime .",
    "thus we can expect a shot noise suppression effect if an electron excited out of a metallic contact with a quantized voltage pulse and an electron emitted by the ses collide at the central qpc .",
    "below we show that this is really the case .",
    "thus let us assume that a periodic pulsed potential is applied to the mc ,    @xmath27     + where @xmath28 is the half - width of the pulse , and @xmath29 is the time when the electron is excited .",
    "such a pulse excites one electron during the period @xmath24 .",
    "the potential @xmath30 , eq.([ac17 ] ) , has a dc component , @xmath31 , and a component which is periodic in time , @xmath32   + the corresponding phase factor @xmath33 , eq.([01 mb ] ) , ( for @xmath34 ) ,    @xmath35     +    7.8 cm    ( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -20,0)@xmath36 ( 117,80 ) ( -35,75 ) ( -87,105 )    .",
    "the result of a numerical evaluation of the shot noise based on eq.([01 ] ) , as a function of the time @xmath37 is given in fig.[fig4_2 ] .",
    "for almost all times @xmath37 the noise is @xmath38 and only at a very special co - incidence time is there a sharp reduction of the noise .",
    "the noise , @xmath38 , is produced by three uncorrelated particles emitted during a period : one electron is emitted by the metallic contact and two particles , an electron and a hole , are emitted by the ses . however , if the mc and the ses emit electrons at the same time , @xmath39 , then after colliding at the central qpc these electrons become correlated and do not contribute effectively to the shot noise .",
    "the remaining value , @xmath40 , is due to the hole emitted by the ses .",
    "the shot noise suppression ( shns ) effect depends on the overlap of wave - packets in time ( hence the times of emission should be the same ) and in space ( hence the width of wave - packets should be the same ) . if the wave packets have different width , see inset to fig.[fig4_2 ] , there is some extra noise .",
    "therefore , the shns effect provides a direct tool to compare the states of particles emitted from the sources of different types , not only from the similar sources .",
    "the shns of two ses s was already discussed in ref .  .",
    "the most used source of electrons in mesoscopics is a biased ( with dc or ac voltage ) metallic contact .",
    "now we show that the electron collider circuit with ses and a biased mc as an electron source does not show what we call the shot noise suppression effect .",
    "therefore , the state of electrons emanating from a biased mc is different from the state of an electron emitted by the ses .",
    "if no ac bias is applied , @xmath41 , the phase factor is @xmath42 and only the fourier coefficients @xmath43 enter eq.([01 ] ) .",
    "we recall that we assume an adiabatic limit @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the time during which an electron ( a hole ) is emitted by the ses .",
    "since @xmath46 , we conclude from eq.([01 ] ) that in this case the shot noise is independent of the sign of the voltage .",
    "therefore , the result will be the same no matter whether the mc emits electrons , @xmath47 , or holes , @xmath48 .",
    "for definiteness we will use @xmath49 .",
    "evaluation of the cross - correlator gives @xmath50 } \\left(1 + 2\\omega\\gamma_{0 } \\left [ \\frac{ev_{2 } } { \\hbar\\omega } \\right ] \\right )   \\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{02}\\ ] ]   + where we have introduced the integer part @xmath51.$ ] this correlator has the following asymptotics ,    @xmath52     + here the first line is the shot - noise due to the ses emitting one electron and one hole during the period .",
    "the second line is the shot noise due to a dc biased metallic contact alone .",
    "@xcite the latter noise is due to scattering at the quantum point contact @xmath0 of extra electrons flowing out of a biased contact above the fermi sea with chemical potential @xmath7 .",
    "these electrons are emitted with rate @xmath53 .",
    "therefore , one could naively expect that if the rate of emission of electrons from the ses and from the mc is the same , @xmath54 , then each emitted electron will collide at the central qpc with an electron propagating within another edge state and the shot noise gets suppressed .",
    "this is not the case ! as follows from eq.([02 ] ) , the shot noise has no strong feature at @xmath55 .",
    "the shot noise is a monotonous function of the dc bias @xmath6 .",
    "a possible reason for this is that the states of electrons emitted from the ses and from the dc biased mc are quite different : the electrons emitted from the ses can be thought as wave - packets with spatial extend proportional to the duration of emission @xmath56 .",
    "in contrast the electrons emitted by the metallic contact are rather plane - wave like extended along the whole edge state .",
    "thus their overlap at the central qpc is minute hence they do not acquire any significant correlations . the shot noise remains roughly the sum of the noises produced independently be the ses and by the dc biased mc .",
    "next we show that the noise suppression effect is also absent if the metallic contact is driven by an ac bias .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 ) ( -10,0)@xmath57 ( -120,75 )    consider next the case of a metallic contact with an ac bias , @xmath58 , @xmath59 . in this case",
    "the metallic contact emits both electrons and holes .",
    "the cross - correlator , eq.([01 ] ) , as a function of amplitude @xmath60 is given in fig.[fig4_1 ] .",
    "there is a small feature at @xmath61 visible in fig.[fig4_1 ] but this feature is minute compared to the huge dip of interest in this work .",
    "therefore , there is no indication of a shot noise suppression at @xmath62 when the rate of emission of particles from the ses and from the mc is the same .",
    "this is in contrast to the case when sinusoidal voltages are applied to both inputs @xcite",
    ". then the discussion can best be cast into excitations of electron - hole pairs @xcite which create a shot noise which has been measured @xcite . for two oscillating voltages theory",
    "predicts significant two - particle correlations due to the hanbury brown - twiss effect which depend on the phase delay of the two oscillating voltages @xcite .",
    "one can wonder whether the absence of the shot noise suppression effect is possibly due to fluctuations in emission of electrons from the biased metallic contact .",
    "our expectation is that neither fluctuations nor a possible presence of multi - electron ( multi - hole ) states play a crucial role . to show it we consider next two circuits .",
    "in fig.[fig2 ] we show a circuit with two single - electron sources , @xmath63 and @xmath64 each emitting one electron and one hole per period @xmath24 .",
    "initially the particle stream is regular .",
    "however , say for particles emitted by the source @xmath63 , at the quantum point contact @xmath65 an electron ( a hole ) can be either reflected to the metallic collector @xmath66 or be transmitted to the central part of a circuit .",
    "thus , the single - electron source @xmath67 together with a corresponding quantum point contact @xmath68 comprise a stochastic single - electron source which can either inject into the central part of a collider one electron ( hole ) during a given period or not .",
    "we assume that all the metallic contacts are grounded and calculate the zero temperature cross - correlator @xmath21 , eq.([ac15_1 ] ) ,    @xmath69     + since there is no bias all the phase factors are @xmath70 in eq.([ac14c ] ) and @xmath71 in eq.([ac15_1 ] ) .",
    "the elements of the frozen scattering matrix are expressed in terms of the transmission / reflection amplitudes @xmath72 for the quantum point contacts @xmath73 , time - dependent amplitudes @xmath74 for sources @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and corresponding phase factors @xmath75 with @xmath76 a length between metallic contacts @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "for instance , @xmath79 .",
    "for @xmath74 we use eq.([07_nsc_03_1 ] ) with emission times @xmath80 and a pulse half - width @xmath56 replaced by @xmath81 and @xmath82 . respectively .",
    "then we find :    @xmath83 \\bigg\\}\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]     + where @xmath84 with @xmath81 ( @xmath68 ) the time of an electron ( @xmath85)/hole ( @xmath86 ) emission by the ses @xmath87 , and the suppression function    @xmath88     + if the single electron sources emit particles at different times , @xmath89 , then the correlation is ,    @xmath90     + this expression is due to the shot noise produced by the four uncorrelated particles ( two electrons and two holes ) emitted by the two sources during the period @xmath24 .",
    "apparently the single - particle contribution ( to the cross - correlator ) is negative .",
    "we call this regime _ classical _ , since the shot noise can be explained in terms of single - particle probabilities only , see appendix  [ app3 ] ..    on the other hand , if the pulses of the same width , @xmath91 , are emitted at the same time , @xmath92 ( for electrons ) and @xmath93 ( for holes ) , then the cross - correlator is suppressed :    @xmath94     + if in addition the circuit is symmetric , @xmath95 , then the cross - correlator is suppressed down to zero .",
    "this suppression is due to a positive two - particle contribution arising ( in addition to negative single - particle contributions which are also present ) when particles ( either two electrons or two holes ) collide at the quantum point contact @xmath0 . due to such collisions",
    "each of the particles loses information about its origin ( i.e. , about the source that emitted it ) and the pair of particles propagating to contacts @xmath19 and @xmath20 in fig.[fig2 ] becomes orbitally entangled .",
    "@xcite we call this regime _ a quantum regime _ , since to describe a shot noise we additionally need to take into account the existence of both direct and exchange two - particle quantum mechanical amplitudes for colliding particles , see appendix [ app3 ] , eq.([07_ppa_09 ] ) .",
    "thus with this circuit we showed that the shot noise suppression effect is sensitive to a space - time confinement of electron states rather than to a regularity in appearance of electrons at the place ( the qpc @xmath0 ) where they can overlap .",
    "now we consider a circuit ( see fig.[fig3 ] ) which contains both a single particle emitter @xmath96 and a two - particle emitter @xmath97 . as a two - particle source we use two single - electron sources",
    "placed close to each other and emitting in synchronism .",
    "@xcite in the adiabatic case of interest here the scattering amplitude @xmath98 is the product of scattering amplitudes of single - electron sources comprising a two - particle source . for simplicity",
    "we assume both sources to be identical .",
    "then @xmath99 is the square of the amplitude given by eq.([07_nsc_03_1 ] ) with @xmath80 and @xmath56 replaced with @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . at the time @xmath102 ( @xmath103 )",
    "the pair of electrons ( holes ) is emitted by the source @xmath104 .",
    "the cross - correlator @xmath16 , eq.([ac15_1 ] ) , reads    @xmath105     + where @xmath9 is the scattering amplitude , eq.([07_nsc_03_1 ] ) , for a single - electron source @xmath96 and @xmath98 is the scattering amplitude for the two - electron ( two - particle ) source @xmath104 shown in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "simple calculations yield :    @xmath106     + where @xmath107 .",
    "the function @xmath108 is ,    @xmath109     + and the suppression function @xmath110 is given in eq.([n03 ] ) with @xmath111 and @xmath112 replaced by @xmath56 ( for a ses ) and @xmath101 ( for a two - particle source ) , respectively .",
    "if all the particles are emitted at different times , @xmath113 , the cross - correlator , @xmath114 , is due to contributions of six uncorrelated particles ( three electrons and three holes ) emitted during the period @xmath24 . while for simultaneous emission , @xmath115",
    ", the cross - correlator is partially suppressed . if @xmath116 , the cross - correlator is suppressed down to the level due to two - particles , @xmath117 .",
    "so when the two - electron wave - packet collides with a single - electron wave - packet , two colliding electrons , one from each side , produce no noise while the remaining electron produces noise as if it propagated alone through the qpc .",
    "the same holds for hole wave - packets .",
    "a method to compare quantum states of initially uncorrelated electrons in mesoscopic circuits was proposed .",
    "the electron streams should be directed onto a quantum point contact from different sides and the cross - correlator of currents flowing out of the qpc should be measured",
    ". in general two uncorrelated streams produce additive noises .",
    "however , if the particles overlap at the qpc they become correlated and the noise gets suppressed .",
    "the closer the quantum states of particles resemble each other the better the overlap that can be achieved , hence the noise is suppressed more strongly .",
    "we considered several sources of electrons , in particular , ( i ) a metallic contact , emitting a rather continuous stream of electrons with a rate proportional to the bias , and ( ii ) a periodically driven quantum capacitor , a single - electron source , emitting traveling wave - packets of electrons which are rather localized in space and alternate with wave packet of holes .",
    "we found that the streams produced by the mc biased with a dc ( ac ) voltage and by the ses remain almost uncorrelated after passing the qpc even if the electrons are emitted with the same rate .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the electrons of these streams are in quite different quantum states . on the other hand ,",
    "if the periodic sequence of quantized voltage pulses is applied to an mc , then the resulting electron stream can be easily correlated with a stream emitted by the ses resulting in a complete suppression of the shot noise . from this",
    "we can conclude that the electrons of these streams are in the same quantum states    if the streams are fluctuating then the shot noise can be suppressed by the amount proportional to the average number of particles overlapping at the qpc .",
    "we also found a partial suppression of the shot noise in the case of pulses carrying different number of particles . basically the remaining noise is due to the difference of the numbers of particles carried by the colliding pulses .",

    "as a single - electron source we use a quantum capacitor @xcite@xmath118@xcite@xmath118@xcite described by a model in which a single circular edge state of circumference @xmath65 in a cavity is coupled via a quantum point contact ( qpc ) with transmission probability @xmath119 to a linear edge state ( see the left upper corner of the fig.[fig1 ] ) . a potential @xmath120 periodic in time",
