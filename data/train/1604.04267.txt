    "one known problem of our age is the environmental pollution . this problem is increasingly reduce the quality of our water",
    "scientists are benefiting from the solution of the advection - diffusion equation ( ade ) in modelling this problem .",
    "since both advection and diffusion terms exist in the ade , it also arises very frequently in transferring mass , heat , energy , velocity and vorticity in engineering and chemistry .",
    "thus , the heat transfer in a draining film , dispersion of tracers in porous media , the intrusion of salt water into fresh water aquifers , the spread of pollutants in rivers and streams , the dispersion of dissolved material in estuaries and coastal sea , contaminant dispersion in shallow lakes , the absorption of chemicals into beds , the spread of solute in a liquid flowing through a tube , long - range transport of pollutants in the atmosphere , forced cooling by fluids of solid material such as windings in turbo generators , thermal pollution in river systems and flow in porous media , etc .",
    "are modeled by ade @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the solution of the advection - diffusion boundary value problem displays sharp boundary layers . to cope with the sharp solutions , some of the spline based methods for the numerical solution of ade",
    "are suggested such as the quasi - lagrangian cubic spline method pepper , okamoto , the characteristic methods integrated with splines szym , tsai , the cubic b - spline galerkin method @xcite , the quadratic b - spline subdomain collocation method @xcite , the spline approximation with the help of upwind collocation nodes @xcite , the exponential spline interpolation in characteristic based scheme @xcite , the cubic spline interpolation for the advection component and the crank - nicolson scheme for the diffusion component @xcite , the meshless method based on thin - plate spline radial basis functions boztosun , the least - square b - spline finite element method @xcite , the standard finite difference method @xcite , the cubic b - spline collocation method @xcite , the quadratic / cubic  b - spline taylor - galerkin methods @xcite , the cubic / quadratic b - spline least - squares finite element techniques @xcite , the cubic b - spline differential quadrature method @xcite , the quadratic galerkin finite elements method @xcite .    the exponential b - spline basis functions are used to establish the numerical methods .",
    "thus the exponential b - spline based collocation method are constructed to solve the differential equations .",
    "numerical solution of the singular perturbation problem is solved with a variant of exponential b - spline collocation method in the work @xcite , the cardinal exponential b - splines is used for solving the singularly perturbed problems @xcite , the exponential b - spline collocation method is built up for finding the numerical solutions of the self - adjoint singularly perturbed boundary value problems in the work @xcite , the numerical solutions of the convection - diffusion equation is obtained by using the exponential b - spline collocation method @xcite . as far as we search , no study exists solving the advection - diffusion problems using the exponential b - spline galerkin method .",
    "thus advection - diffusion equation is fully integrated with combination of the exponential b - spline galerkin method ( ebsgm ) for space discretization and crank - nicolson method for time discretization .",
    "the study is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "exponential b - splines are introduced and their some basic relations are given . in section 3 , the application of the numerical method to the ade is given .",
