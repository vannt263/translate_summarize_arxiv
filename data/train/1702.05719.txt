    "a nash equilibrium assigns a strategy to alice and bob such that no player has any incentive to unilaterally change his strategy @xcite .",
    "it is proven that if the players can randomize on their pure strategies set according to _ any _ probability distribution , then the game has at least one nash equilibrium in the randomized mixed strategies .",
    "however , assume that alice has restrictions on implementing probability distributions when choosing his mixed strategy .",
    "more specifically , assume that alice can only choose a mixed action with entropy at most a given number @xmath0 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath1 , alice is only allowed to play pure actions .",
    "we are interested in the maximum payoff that alice can secure with mixed actions of entropy at most @xmath0 ( regardless of the action of bob ) .",
    "let us denote this by @xmath2 .",
    "equivalently , we may ask : in order to guarantee average payoff of @xmath3 , how much randomness needs to be utilized by alice ? let us denote the minimum entropy of the randomness consumed by alice to guarantee payoff @xmath3 by @xmath4 . we may call @xmath4 , the _ min - entropy function_. observe that @xmath5 is the inverse function of @xmath6 .",
    "even though @xmath2 is defined in a one - shot setting , the ( upper concave envelope ) of @xmath2 finds an operational meaning in @xcite in the context of repeated games as the payoff that alice can secure in the long run .",
    "for instance , gossner and vieille @xcite study a repeated game in which alice can not randomize freely , but has access to an external i.i.d .",
    "source @xmath7 which are revealed symbol by symbol ( causally ) to alice as the game is played out .",
    "they show that the entropy of the source @xmath8 characterizes the payoff that alice can secure in the long run , and the answer is given in terms of @xmath9 .",
    "this is similar to shannon s compression formula @xmath8 which is defined on a single copy of the source ( _ single letter _ ) , but gives the ultimate compression limit when multiple copies of the source are observed .",
    "another motivation for @xmath2 is given in @xcite , arguing that limitation on random strategies of players stems from simplicity of humans ; that ",
    "humans are known to be bad at generating random - like sequences \" .    to compute @xmath4",
    ", one has to first consider the set of distributions on the action of alice that would secure a payoff @xmath3 for her .",
    "this set will be a polytope in the space of all probability distributions .",
    "then , one should solve an entropy minimization problem over this polytope in the space of probability distributions .",
    "in fact , minimizing and maximizing entropy arises in a wide range of contexts .",
    "computing maximum entropy under a set of linear constraints is a well - studied problem with a wide range of applications , _",
    "see @xcite@xcite and the principle of maximum entropy .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that computing the minimum entropy can be also quite important . furthermore , many algorithms for clustering and pattern recognition are essentially solving entropy minimization problems @xcite .",
    "an important special case of the entropy minimization problem ( with its own applications ) is that of finding a joint probability of minimum entropy given its marginal distributions ( the marginal distribution is a linear constraint on the joint probability distribution ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the quantum version of the entropy minimization problem is of key theoretical importance.@xcite    while the calculation of the function @xmath4 has received attention in the game theory literature , entropy minimization problem are known to be an np - hard non - convex optimization problem @xcite .",
    "since the entropy is a concave function over the probability simplex , its minimum occurs at a vertex of the feasible domain . as a result ,",
    "computation of @xmath10 leads to a search problem over an exponentially large set . even though the algorithm of @xcite can be used to compute @xmath4 , but it has no guarantee of success .    our contributions can be summarized as follows :    * we study the properties of @xmath10 and give a number of easy - to - compute bounds on the value of @xmath10 .",
    "one of the bounds on @xmath10 is expressed in term of a linear program ; this linear program has a quite general form .",
    "we employ _ probabilistic tools _ to study this linear program to prove the following explicit lower bound on @xmath4 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the minimum and maximum entries of the entries of the payoff table ; @xmath14 is the payoff that alice can guarantee with deterministic strategies ( pure - strategy security level ) and @xmath15 is the nash value of the game for alice ( payoff that alice can guarantee with no restriction on her action s entropy ) . because the linear program we consider has a quite general form ( and can be converted to other linear programs with a change of variables ) , our use of probabilistic tools for studying linear programs is novel .",
    "* we give and utilize new results on the set of mixed strategies that guarantee a certain security level . while the literature on game theory makes extensive use of total variation distance between distributions , we propose and illustrate the use of the @xmath16divergence ( or the tsallis divergence of order two ) in game theoretic contexts .",
    "the @xmath16divergence is defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are two probability distributions . to see the applicability of this divergence measure ,",
    "consider a zero - sum game between alice and bob .",
    "fix an arbitrary ( mixed ) strategy for bob .",
    "let @xmath20 and @xmath21 be two probability distributions for the action of alice .",

    "we simplify and generalize the proof of gossner and vieille in section [ sec:5op ] .",
    "the generalized setup considers the possibility of leackage of alice s random source sequence to bob in the zero - sum game .",
    "more specifically , we assume an i.i.d",
    ".  sequence of pairs @xmath28 , @xmath29 distributed according to a given @xmath30 . the sequence @xmath31 is revealed symbol by symbol ( causally ) to alice as the game is played out , while the sequence @xmath32 is revealed symbol by symbol to bob .",
    "we can view @xmath33 as the side information that bob obtains about alice s observation .",
    "as before , alice can not randomize freely and can only use the randomness in the sequence @xmath31 .",
    "we show that the upper concave envelope of @xmath2 , at @xmath34 is the maximum payoff that alice can secure regardless of bob s actions ; furthermore , bob can ensure that alice does not get more than this payoff .",
    "this result is a generalization of the result of gossner and vieille since when @xmath35 is a constant random variable , the conditional entropy @xmath36 reduces to the unconditional entropy @xmath8 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section  [ s : prob_state ] we give a mathematical definition of the problem under study ; in section  [ s : results ] we express the main results . finally , in section  [ s : proofs ] we give the proofs .",
    "some of the details are left for the appendices .",
    "add notation of @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "consider a zero - sum game between players alice ( @xmath39 ) and bob ( @xmath40 ) with respective pure strategy sets @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are natural numbers .",

    "the set of all randomized strategies of players @xmath39 and @xmath40 are denoted by @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively which are probability simplexes on sample spaces @xmath51 and @xmath52 respectively .",
    "thus , alice s strategy corresponds to a probability mass function ( pmf ) @xmath53 , which can be also illustrated as a column vector with non - negative entries that add up to one .",
    "assume that player @xmath39 uses randomized strategy @xmath37 .",
    "then the payoff of alice if bob plays @xmath54 is @xmath55 .",
    "we say that alice secures payoff @xmath3 with randomized strategy @xmath37 ( regardless of the action of player @xmath40 ) if @xmath56 for all @xmath54 .",
    "thus , the set of all distributions that guarantee payoff @xmath57 for player @xmath39 can be expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the transpose of the column vector @xmath37 , @xmath60 is a column vector of all ones and @xmath61 means any element of @xmath62 is greater than or equal to the corresponding element at @xmath63 .",
    "we define @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the shannon entropy of probability mass function ( pmf ) @xmath37 , defined as @xmath66 where all the logarithms in this paper are in base two .",
