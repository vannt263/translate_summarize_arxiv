    "the star formation rate ( sfr ) of galaxies can be seen as some kind of sesame that opens up the door of a quantitative understanding of the formation and the evolution of galaxies at all redshifts .",
    "it is one of the main tools of modern extragalactic astrophysics and astronomers world - wide have been looking for the best one(s ) for several decades .",
    "all young stars in galaxies emit ultraviolet ( uv ) photons that can be collected by telescopes to estimate the sfr of these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however young stars might be embedded in dust that prevents part of the uv photons to reach our telescopes .",
    "these uv photons are scattered and absorbed by dust grains and reprocessed into infrared ( ir ) photons ( e.g. @xcite ) which poses a problem to obtain a reliable sfr than can be seen as a total one .",
    "several methods have been proposed to evaluate the total amount of sfr , including that part hidden in dust which can not be measured by uv / optical telescopes .",
    "@xcite proposed a version based on a correction for the dust attenuation that would be applied to the uv flux .",
    "this correction relies only on uv data and is estimated from the uv slope @xmath15 ( assuming @xmath16 ) : the redder the uv slope the larger the correction .",
    "however , this method seems not to be fully reliable for any type of galaxies ( @xcite ) or , at least , provides an estimate that is not very accurate .",
    "usually , the calibration is performed from infrared far - ir ( fir ) data but this happens not to be that simple because of various technological challenges : the low transparency of the atmosphere that implies to launch space telescopesl to observe above a few micrometers , the necessity to develop efficient detectors in this wavelength range and , of course , the mandatory cooling of these telescopes . moving from the fir to the mid - ir ( mir ) looks like a good idea since the mir emission is easier to measure but , again , there might be issues that need to be carefully checked .",
    "first , the mir range can be subject to a contamination from stellar emission ( especially when observing high redshift objects ) .",
    "next , some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) emission features are present in this range that are correlated to the metallicity ( @xcite ) . then , most of the sfr relationships have been calibrated from ( or at least mostly rely on ) observations of local galaxies",
    ". we can wonder whether they are also valid at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of galaxies can evolve with the redshift and we do not definitely know , for instance , whether or not low and high redshifts share the same pah emissions in the mir .",
    "moreover , even when higher redshift objects have been accounted for ( e.g. @xcite ) , these galaxies are not uv - selected galaxies .",
    "so , we have to check whether the relationships developped from ir samples are valid for uv - selected samples .",
    "our objective , in this paper , is to use two samples of galaxies : one selected from deep @xmath0 observations of the chandra deep field south ( cdfs ) and one sample of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at @xmath1 from galex ( @xcite and @xcite ) to compare estimates of the dust luminosities ( computed from rest - frame @xmath7  i.e. akari observations at @xmath0  using formulae provided by several authors ) to the ones evaluated from spitzer observed flux densities at @xmath2 ( i.e. rest - frame @xmath8 at @xmath17 ) .",
    "then , we will test the mir seds through a comparison of the observed @xmath11 flux ratio with several libraries of seds .",
    "recent works by @xcite and @xcite suggest that the dust - to - uv luminosity ratio ( @xmath12 ) would decrease from @xmath18 to @xmath19 for a galaxy with a given luminosity @xmath9 . however , this effect is based on a comparison of datasets at different redshifts and we need to revisit this effect after checking the conversions from mir luminosites to @xmath9 .    in sect .",
    "2 , we will present the observations of the chandra deep field south with akari / irc camera through the l15 filter centered at @xmath0 .",
    "3 will present the two samples that we will use in this paper .",
    "then , we will test several calibrations of @xmath7 mir luminosities to total dust luminosities . in sect .",
    "4 , we will study the evolution of ir - to - uv luminosity ratio with the redshift by accounting for the results found in the paper . finally , sect .",
    "5 will present the spectral energy distribution libraries that we will use .",
    "we will try to understand better the physics of the two galaxy samples by analysing the @xmath11 ratio by a comparison with the models and templates .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the akari satellite @xcite is a japanese space mission dedicated to infrared astrophysics and was launched on board jaxa s m - v8 launch vehicle on february 22 , 2006 japan standard time , jst .",
    "akari has a 68.5 cm cooled telescope with two focal plane instruments , the far - infrared surveyor ( fis ) @xcite and the infrared camera ( irc ) .",
    "the irc consists of three cameras , the irc - nir , mir - s & mir - l covering 1.7 26 @xmath23 m in 9 bands with fields of view ( fov ) of 10@xmath24 @xmath25 10@xmath24 @xcite .",
    "although the nir / mir - s cameras share the same field of view , the mir - l camera is separated on the sky by 20 arcmin .",
    "akari observations are segregated into large surveys ( ls ) and guaranteed time mission programs .",
    "in addition , 10@xmath26 of the total observation time was reserved for open time observations from esa member institutes . in this work",
    ", we report on our open time program ( irlbg , p.i .",
    "d. burgarella ) to image the chandra deep field south ( cdfs : ra=53.0465 , dec=-27.8307 , j2000 ) in the akari - irc @xmath27 m band ( the l15 band covering the wavelength range 12.6 ",
    "19.4@xmath23 m ) .",
    "a total of 5 pointed observations were taken on the 31st january and 1st february 2007 , using the irc astronomical observing template ( aot ) designed for deep observations ( irc05 ) in the configuration @xmath28 , corresponding to the l15 filter on the irc - mir - l camera ( see table [ tab : obslog ] ) . in this configuration ,",
    "each pointing consists of approximately 10 exposure cycles .",
    "each exposure cycle consists of a single short ( 0.6s ) exposure frame and three long ( 19s ) exposure frames . for deep imaging ,",
    "the short exposure frames are insignificant and are often discarded .",
    "note that , for a target centered on the fov of the mir - l , data is also taken in the nir / mir - s cameras , albeit offset by @xmath2920 arcmin with the fov rotating around the mir - l target position .",
    "the irc05 aot has no explicit dithering built into the aot , therefore dithering is achieved by carrying out at least three pointed observations with this aot at any given position .",
    "the dithering is achieved from the natural slight offset movement and slight rotation of the field of view between any pair of pointed observations    the data were reduced by the standard irc imaging pipeline ( version 070911 ; see irc data user manual by @xcite ) .",
    "the pipeline corrects basic instrumental effects , performing dark subtraction , linearity correction , distortion correction and flat fielding . the superdark frame version 061109 and super flat version 070912 were used . in order to reduce the effect from the numerous hot pixels in the mir - l detectors ,",
    "hot pixels were identified and set to a very large numeric value such that they would be identified and removed as cosmic ray events in a later processing stage of the pipeline .",
    "the pixel values were then interpolated using the surrounding pixel values after the flat fielding .",
    "akari observations suffer from the effects of stray light from earthshine and we have rejected any frames whose sky value had a measured standard deviation significantly larger than the mean between frames . before combining the image from individual exposure frames for a single pointing , the frames have a median sky subtracted .",
    "alignment of the frames for co - addition is usually determined by the position of bright point sources in each frame . however , in case of the mir - l channel , the number of the point sources which had sufficient signal - to - noise were too few .",
    "therefore , in order to align the mir - l frames , we identified common objects in our mir - l frame and in the spitzer @xmath2 fidel image ( http://ssc.spitzer.caltech.edu/legacy/ ) .",
    "spurious events , such as cosmic rays and electronic ghost images are removed at the co - addition stage using a 3 sigma clipping technique .",
    "for our data , given the large number of frames available for co - addition , we used the ccdclip option in the pipeline , where the detector noise performance is assumed as opposed to the default option sigclip where the noise performance is estimated from the data itself .",
    "the average rather than the median value among the frames , for each pixel was used in order to further improve the signal - to - noise of the final image . for every pointing a total of 30 exposure frames were co - added corresponding to a total exposure time of 570s .",

    "@xcite and @xcite found a decrease of the @xmath12 ratio of ultraviolet - selected galaxies with the redshift from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "however , since we found in the previous section that @xcite over estimated @xmath9 , we must revisit the evolution of @xmath12 assuming another conversion . note that with the updated calibration , the median and mean @xmath9 for reddy et al.s sample are respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we also find in the previous section the conversion given by @xcite provides under estimated @xmath9 , probably because of some missing emission too deeply enshrouded in dust .",
    "we will therefore use @xcite conversion instead of @xcite in the following to compute a new estimate of @xmath12 at @xmath19 .",
    "this new conversion means that @xmath32 decreases by @xmath33 for ultraviolet - selected galaxies in the luminosity range corresponding to lirgs .",
    "the @xmath17 @xmath12 was computed by @xcite by using @xcite conversion and we are , therefore , in the optimum case where both estimates from @xmath10 and @xmath8 @xmath9 are fully consistent . note that replacing @xcite conversion by @xcite one would change @xmath9 estimated from the rest - frame @xmath8 luminosityes by @xmath34 .",

    "together with the addition of a point at @xmath38 from the upper limit on the gravitational lens hcm 61 studied by @xcite .",
    "it is important to notice that the dust luminosity of this very high redshift object is @xmath39 .",

    "<S> deep observations of the chandra deep field south have been secured at @xmath0 with akari / irc infrared space telescope . from these observations , </S>",
    "<S> we define a sample of mid infrared - selected galaxies at @xmath0 and we also obtain @xmath0 flux densities for a sample of lyman break galaxies at @xmath1 already observed at @xmath2 with spitzer / mips . </S>",
    "<S> number counts for the mid infrared - selected sample show a bump around a @xmath0 flux density of @xmath3 that can be attributed to galaxies at @xmath4 and at @xmath5 for the fainter part of the bump . </S>",
    "<S> this bump seems to be shifted as compared to other works and a possible origin can be the cosmic variance . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to this dataset , we have tested , on the two above samples @xmath1 , the validity of the conversions from monochromatic luminosities @xmath6 at a rest - frame wavelength of @xmath7 by a comparison with total dust luminosities estimated from spitzer rest - frame @xmath8 data that we use as a reference . we find that the @xmath7 dust luminosities are not all consistent and that some of them are better when compared to @xmath9 evaluated from longer wavelength luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the rest - frame @xmath10 luminosities provide globally good estimates of @xmath9 . by comparing our data for the two samples to several libraries of spectral energy distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we find that models can explain the diversity of the observed @xmath11 ratio quite reasonably for the mir - selected sample and better for the lbg sample which are less dispersed than the mir selection . </S>",
    "<S> however , when we analyse the luminosity dependence of this ratio , we find important discrepancies . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we revisit the evolution of @xmath12 ratio with the redshift @xmath13 by re - calibrating previous @xmath9 at @xmath14 based on our results and added new data points at higher redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> the decreasing trend is amplified as compared to the previous estimate . </S>"
