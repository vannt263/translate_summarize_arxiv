    "in the era of precision cosmology , the star formation history of the universe can be studied accurately as one can detect evolutionary effects in the observables on top of the global expansion . in particular ,",
    "the restframe ultraviolet luminosity of galaxies has proven to yield a good handle on the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "a number of galaxy surveys have probed the history of star formation at different redshifts . while most studies agree on a relatively rapid rise in the star formation rate ( sfr ) out to redshift of @xmath5 , significant uncertainties remain even at lower redshifts @xcite .",
    "the restframe uv continuum of local galaxies is not accessible from the ground .",
    "the balloon - borne telescope of the foca experiment @xcite had been the best window onto the uv sky until last year , when the _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) satellite was successfully launched to orbit .",
    "this paper is one in the first series of luminosity function papers on galex sources and focuses on galaxies at redshifts between @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "we use photometric redshifts to boost our sample size by a factor of 20 compared to spectroscopic data available . throughout the paper , we assume a flat @xmath8cdm cosmology with @xmath9 and @xmath10 km s@xmath11 mpc@xmath11 .",
    "the galex telescope has two photometric bands at 1530 ( ) and 2310 ( ) and a 1.2 degree field of view . for a detailed description of survey and performance ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite in the present volume .",
    "our sample consists of medium imaging survey ( mis ) fields overlapping with the data release one coverage of the sdss @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the depth of the mis fields is well matched to sdss and this unique 7-band multicolor dataset provides a good basis for various statistical studies .",
    "we select the 57 fields with more than @xmath12 second exposure times and no objects with higher extinction than @xmath13 .",
    "we use 36 arcmin radius circles in the center of the fields to ensure uniform image quality .",
    "the intersection of the unique area of these mis fields with the sdss dr1 footprint is 43.9 square degrees .",
    "our catalog contains only objects that are classified as galaxies by the sdss photometric pipeline based on their morphology .",
    "we use total magnitudes corrected for foreground extinction : sextractor s mag_auto for galex and model magnitudes from sdss . for the limiting magnitudes , we elect to choose a safe @xmath14 cut in both bands to ensure completeness @xcite .",
    "photometric redshifts are utilized to fully exploit the data set .",
    "we choose empirical photometric redshifts over template based estimates because currently the galex photometric system is only known to about 10% accuracy and sed fitting is sensitive to zeropoint errors .",
    "following @xcite , a third order polynomial formula was applied to map the galex and sdss @xmath15 magnitudes to photometric redshifts .",
    "note that the magnitude was excluded from the fitting formula as the observations go deeper and not all galaxies have measurements .",
    "this way there is only one redshift estimator that can be used for both and limited samples .",
    "we find that the empirical fit yields reliable redshift estimates out to redshift of 0.25 .",
    "for the training set of 6295 galaxies , the rms scatter is @xmath16 and there is about 2% outliers .",
    "this accuracy is about 15% better than sdss alone using the same technique .",
    "a more detailed analysis and a photometric redshift catalog will be published elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we expect the uncertainty in the photometric redshifts to be a significant source of error in our statistical analysis , so we adopt a conservative nominal redshift error of @xmath17 .",
    "figure  [ fig : zz ] compares the spectroscopic and photometric redshifts as a function of redshift .",
    "one of the disadvantages of the empirical photometric redshifts is that the method does not provide a direct measurement of the spectral types or k - corrections . to overcome this",
    ", we fit synthetic model spectra with full wavelength coverage from the uv to the ir to the sdss photometry and pick the best fitting template for each galaxy .",
    "our template set has 10 interpolated spectra from ell to irr of @xcite .",
    "for each of these templates , the k - correction is calculated as a function of redshift .",
    "in addition to the galaxy templates , we also include a series of qso spectra in an attempt to identify agns in the sample .",
    "those objects which are best fitted with quasar templates , roughly 10% , are removed from the sample .",
    "our photometric redshift catalog contains 190,489 mis galaxies out of which 9,356 pass the area , magnitude , redshift and sed cuts in the and 6,174 in .",
    "there are several methods for calculating the luminosity function @xcite .",
    "we use the @xmath18 method @xcite to calculate the lf in 0.1 magnitude wide bins , first , we derive the absolute magnitude using the distance modulus and the k - correction , then the maximum redshift where the object could be observed from .",
    "the lf is then calculated as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 for a flat universe , @xmath21 is the areal coverage and @xmath22 is the comoving distance .    to estimate the uncertainty in the lf , we create 50 monte - carlo ( mc ) realizations of the catalogs drawing the redshifts randomly from gaussian distributions with means of the originally estimated redshifts and widths of @xmath17 .",
    "we coadd the mc realizations for a more robust estimate of the true lf .",
    "this method allows us to propagate the errors .",
    "the errorbars plotted in the figures are combinations of the variations among the mc realizations and the poisson errors added in quadrature .",
    "to study the evolution of the uv lf as a function of redshift , we split the sample into three redshift shells . these low",
    ", medium and high redshift subsamples have galaxies in the 0.070.13 , 0.130.19 and 0.190.25 intervals .",
    "figure  [ fig : lfz ] shows the and lfs for the three redshift slices along with their best fitting @xcite functions .",
    "the absolute magnitude range over the luminosity functions can be fitted is limited at the faint end by the lower redshift cutoff in the more distance shells and also at the bright end at @xmath23 , where the measurements depart from the schechter function .",
    "the latter is due to residual contamination from qso light that the sed fitting could not eliminate completely .",
    "the insets show the @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 confidence regions on the @xmath27 plane .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : lfz ] , there is a modest evolution in @xmath4 with redshift in both bands but the leverage is not enough to constrain @xmath2 to high accuracy at higher redshifts . in all cases ,",
    "the slope is consistent with @xmath28 .",
    "table  [ tbl : lf ] lists the schechter parameters .",
    "we further divide the lowest redshift and limited samples into two spectral classes based on the assigned seds .",
    "the early type galaxy class consists of objects with the five reddest templates and late type galaxies with the five bluer seds , which corresponds to a restframe color cut of @xmath29 .",
    "this technique is expected to be more robust than the actual @xmath30 discriminator as all multicolor information is used .",
    "figure  [ fig : lftype ] shows the and luminosity function for the early and late type galaxies .",
    "we find that @xmath4 is brighter for the red population by approximately 0.2 magnitudes in and by 0.4 in and @xmath2 is shallower than for the blue population by 0.3 , see table  [ tbl : lf ] .",
    "the marginalized errors on both @xmath4 and @xmath2 are large but the difference between the joint distribution of parameters is significant ( see insets of figure  [ fig : lftype ] . ) when using the restframe colors to split galaxies into red and blue , the plots exhibit the same features ; the lfs at the faint end ( @xmath31 ) are essentially indistinguishable and the bright end is also consistent with the template based results although the difference is slightly less pronounced as expected due to the larger scatter . the inverse concentration indices , simply the ratios of the radii containing 50% and 90% of the petrosian @xmath32 fluxes , scatter significantly but on average they are larger for galaxies in the blue class than the red ones , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the red value is noticeably higher than that of the elliptical sdss galaxies , @xmath35 @xcite , which indicates that our redder class too contains spiral galaxies .",
    "we derive the mean luminosity density ( ld ) by integrating the luminosity with the schechter function , @xmath36 in fact , the integral is calculated for not just the optimal fit but over the whole range of parameters .",
    "weighting the results by the probability , @xmath37 , is essentially the same as using monte - carlo realizations for estimating the errors , @xmath38 .",
    "since the redshift range is limited , the errorbars on the higher redshift bins are rather large .",
    "table  [ tbl : lf ] shows the ld measurements along with the statistical errors and estimates for the systematics due to cosmic variance that were derived similarly as in @xcite .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : zevol ] , both @xmath39 and @xmath40 increase with redshift and are consistent with @xmath41 as well as @xmath42 .",
    "the errorbars in the figure are the combinations of the two sources of errors added in quadrature .",
    "they do not include errors from calibration uncertainties of @xmath43 that may account for @xmath44 in both bands .",
    "using 2df redshifts , the local galex studies by @xcite and @xcite derived very consitent results with the present findings . in the corresponding redshift ranges , the schechter fits are mostly within the 68% confidence regions with perhaps the one exception of @xmath4 in , which seems to be brighter based on this photometric sample .",
    "the reason is that the different magnitude cuts in the uv yield slightly different galaxy populations and our sample has more redder galaxies , which makes @xmath4 brighter .",
    "the ld measurements are also in good agreement with @xcite , and the observed trend is consistent with the galex deep imaging survey results by @xcite and @xcite probing the higher redshift universe out to @xmath45 .",
    "the evolution , in turn , is also consistent with results by @xcite , who find it to be proportional to @xmath46 for galaxies out to @xmath47 at restframe 2500 .",
    "going from the observed uv luminosity function to a sfr function is complicated by dust and the fact that the and light trace stars forming on different timescales .",
    "we will address this problem in subsequent galex papers .",
    "galex ( galaxy evolution explorer ) is a nasa small explorer , launched in april 2003 .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge nasa s support for construction , operation , and science analysis for the galex mission , developed in cooperation with the centre national detudes spatiales of france and the korean ministry of science and technology .",
