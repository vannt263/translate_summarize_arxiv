    "in addition to being nonlinear , many components in a signal processing or communication system have a dynamic range constraint .",
    "for example , light emitting diodes ( leds ) are dynamic range constrained devices that appear in intensity modulation ( i m ) and direct detection ( dd ) based optical wireless communication ( owc ) systems  @xcite@xcite . to drive an led",
    ", the input electric signal must be positive and exceed the turn - on voltage of the device .",
    "on the other hand , the signal is also limited by the saturation point or maximum permissible value of the led .",
    "thus , the dynamic range constraint can be modeled as two - sided clipping .",
    "the same situation may happen in other applications such as digital audio processing  @xcite .",
    "both nonlinearity and clipping result in distortions which may cause system performance degradation .",
    "sndr is a commonly used metric to quantify the distortion that is uncorrelated to the signal  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "previous work in this area mainly concentrated on a family of amplitude - limited nonlinearities that is common in radio frequency ( rf ) system design involving nonlinear components such as power amplifiers ( pas ) and mixers .",
    "different from the previous work , our study discusses the class of nonlinearities with a two - sided dynamic range constraint that is more commonly found in optical and acoustic systems .",
    "authors in  @xcite-@xcite illustrated the impact of led nonlinearity and clipping noise in owc systems .",
    "some predistortion strategies were proposed in  @xcite-@xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge , the optimal nonlinear mapping under the two - sided dynamic range constraint has not been studied .",
    "there are two major differences from the amplitude - limited nonlinearity .",
    "first , the signal will be subject to turn - on clipping and saturation clipping to meet the dynamic range constraint .",
    "second , dc biasing must be used to shift the signal to an appropriate level to minimize distortion . in this paper",
    ", we will show that the ideal linearizer that maximizes the sndr is a double - sided limiter that has an affine response .",
    "the parameters of the response can be calculated from the distribution of the input signal and the noise power .    in additional to deriving the sndr - optimal predistorter",
    ", we also relate a lower bound on channel capacity to the sndr , further motivating the sndr considerations .",
    "finally , we employ another common distortion metric , dynamic signal - to - noise ratio ( dsnr ) to provide an upper bound on the double - sided clipping channel .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : section ii introduces the system model for dynamic range limited nonlinearity and the corresponding sndr definition . in section iii",
    ", we derive the optimal nonlinear mapping that maximizes the sndr and illustrate some examples . in section iv",
    ", we related the sndr to the capacity of the nonlinear channel . finally , section vii concludes the paper .",

    "<S> many components used in signal processing and communication applications , such as power amplifiers and analog - to - digital converters , are nonlinear and have a finite dynamic range . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity associated with these devices distorts the input , which can degrade the overall system performance . </S>",
    "<S> signal - to - noise - and - distortion ratio ( sndr ) is a common metric to quantify the performance degradation . </S>",
    "<S> one way to mitigate nonlinear distortions is by maximizing the sndr . in this paper , we analyze how to maximize the sndr of the nonlinearities in optical wireless communication ( owc ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we answer the question of how to optimally predistort a double - sided memory - less nonlinearity that has both a `` turn - on '' value and a maximum `` saturation '' value . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sndr - maximizing response given the constraints is a double - sided limiter with a certain linear gain and a certain bias value . </S>",
    "<S> both the gain and the bias are functions of the probability density function ( pdf ) of the input signal and the noise power . </S>",
    "<S> we also find a lower bound of the nonlinear system capacity , which is given by the sdnr and an upper bound determined by dynamic signal - to - noise ratio ( dsnr ) . </S>",
    "<S> an application of the results herein is to design predistortion linearization of nonlinear devices like light emitting diodes ( leds ) .    </S>",
