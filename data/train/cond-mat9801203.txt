    "progress in materials synthesis has allowed to study a variety of two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems such as thin films , surfaces , and semiconductor quantum wells .",
    "these systems as well as the nearly 2d cuprates have lead to much interest in 2d quantum magnetism .",
    "it has been found that 2d electron gases in quantum wells in the quantum hall regime are novel itinerant ferromagnets.@xcite the strong external magnetic field quenches the kinetic energy , leading to widely separated landau levels , but because of band structure effects it couples only weakly to the electron spins .",
    "thus low - energy spin fluctuations play an important role .",
    "these 2d continuum ferromagnets exhibit topological excitations called skyrmions@xcite in analogy to the skyrme model of nuclear physics.@xcite in the quantum hall system these excitations carry electrical charge.@xcite at filling factor @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , if the spin - up states in the lowest landau level are just filled , skyrmions only appear as thermal excitations of the form of skyrmion - antiskyrmion pairs . at filling factors away from unity , however , skyrmions appear even in the ground state.@xcite at all filling factors , low - energy spin fluctuations are also present .",
    "the combination of spin fluctuations and skyrmions dramatically alters the magnetization@xcite and the specific heat.@xcite    for a quantitative understanding it is useful to first study the case of @xmath0 to isolate the effect of low - energy spin fluctuations , which are expected to be well described by a heisenberg model , at least at low enough temperatures . at higher temperatures",
    "higher order gradient terms neglected in the heisenberg model could become important .",
    "renormalization group arguments@xcite show that in @xmath4 dimensions the magnetization @xmath5 of the quantum hall ferromagnet at @xmath0 is a universal function , @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the spin , @xmath8 is the exchange coupling , and @xmath9 is the external magnetic field . for @xmath10",
    "this universality is violated by logarithmic corrections.@xcite in the heisenberg model the magnetization only depends on the _ three _ dimensionless quantities @xmath7 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 . read and sachdev@xcite have evaluated the magnetization using su(@xmath1 ) and o(@xmath1 ) schwinger boson formulations of mean field ( mf ) theory , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath13 , for the heisenberg model . in a recent communication@xcite",
    "we have presented analytic results for the leading @xmath2 corrections to the magnetization and results of extensive quantum monte carlo simulations . in the present paper we present details of the @xmath2 theory .",
    "details of the monte carlo simulations are given elsewhere.@xcite an alternative microscopic approach which includes spin - wave corrections to the electronic self - energy has also recently been developed.@xcite    schwinger boson theories@xcite have proved useful in finding mf theories which respect the symmetry of the hamiltonian .",
    "formal results to any order in @xmath2 have also been obtained.@xcite however , numerically evaluating the first order ( @xmath2 ) corrections is not an easy task .",
    "et al_.@xcite have evaluated various ground - state quantities of a frustrated antiferromagnet in the absence of external fields .",
    "although they are not using the large @xmath1 formalism , their method is equivalent to a @xmath2 expansion to first order .",
    "there are a number of subtle pitfalls in the @xmath2 calculations , _",
    "e.g. _ , regarding normal ordering of operators .",
    "it seems worthwhile to present the calculations in some detail for the benefit of readers interested in using @xmath2 expansion methods .",
    "we also hope to make the physical interpretation of these theories clearer and shed some light on the level of accuracy of @xmath2 expansions .    in the following we give an overview of this work .",
    "first , the heisenberg hamiltonian is mapped onto an equivalent boson system .",
    "there are several ways of doing this .",
    "one is the holstein - primakoff representation,@xcite which has a number of disadvantages , _",
    "e.g. _ , the square root of operators it introduces , and we do not employ it here .",
    "instead we introduce schwinger bosons@xcite in two different ways .",
    "the first , presented in sec .",
    "[ 2.1 ] , makes use of the su(2 ) symmetry in spin space of the heisenberg model ( which is explicitly broken by an external field ) .",
    "the second utilizes the local equivalence between the groups su(2 ) and o(3 ) to write down an equivalent o(3 ) boson model ( sec .  [ 3.1 ] ) .",
    "subsequently , the two models are generalized to su(@xmath1 ) and o(@xmath1 ) , respectively , which contain @xmath1 bosons at each site . at this point",
    "a remark may be in order on what we do _ not _",
    "mean by the o(@xmath1 ) model .",
    "it is not an @xmath1 component vector model , _",
    "e.g. _ , an @xmath1 component quantum non - linear sigma model .",
    "rather , the spin operators are generators of the lie group o(@xmath1 )",
    ". only for @xmath14 are the generators antisymmetric @xmath15 matrices , which are dual to ( axial ) vectors .",
    "thus our results are not easily compared to expansions in the number of components of the spin vectors , as developed by garanin@xcite for a classical system .",
    "it is now possible to expand in @xmath2 as a small parameter .",
    "mf theory becomes exact for both su(@xmath16 ) and o(@xmath16).@xcite the @xmath2 expansion is a saddle - point expansion around this mf solution , not a perturbative expansion in the interaction .",
    "for this reason it is , in principle , equally valid at all temperatures . also , it does respect the symmetry of the heisenberg model .",
    "this property makes even the mf results qualitatively correct . in particular , the absence of long range order if no external field is present is correctly predicted .",
    "after rederiving the mf magnetization in sec .",
    "[ 2.2 ] for the su(@xmath1 ) model and in sec .",
    "[ 3.2 ] for o(@xmath1 ) , we calculate the @xmath2 corrections using a diagrammatic approach@xcite ( secs .  [ 2.3 ] and [ 3.3 ] ) .",
    "these corrections take fluctuations around the mf result into account .",
    "we will make use of gauge invariance to simplify our task .",
    "here we also have to discuss the effect of normal ordering . in principle , terms to any order in @xmath2 can be obtained in the same way .",
    "the system without exchange interaction can be solved exactly for any value of the spin @xmath7 and for any @xmath1 in both the su(@xmath1 ) and the o(@xmath1 ) model .",
    "it can be used to check the @xmath2 expansion .",
    "however , the interaction introduces a number of additional complications .",
    "we start from a heisenberg model with nearest - neighbor interaction on a square lattice in a constant magnetic field , @xmath17 where the sum over @xmath18 is over all nearest - neighbor bonds .",
    "a factor of @xmath19 has been absorbed into the field @xmath9 .",
    "the total spin at each site is @xmath7 ; @xmath20 .",
    "we express the spins in terms of bose operators using a schwinger boson representation , where two bose fields @xmath21 and @xmath22 are introduced according to@xcite @xmath23 to restrict the hilbert space to the physical states , the constraint @xmath24 is introduced , which corresponds to @xmath25 for the original hamiltonian .",

    ", the spin operators expressed in terms of bosons have to have the correct commutation relations .",
    "this is easily shown to be the case .    utilizing the su(2 ) symmetry group of the spins we write the hamiltonian in a more compact form by first defining a su(2 ) spin matrix @xmath27 with the constraint @xmath28 .",
    "the hamiltonian is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a pauli matrix and summation over repeated indices is implied . here , the spin matrices @xmath31 should be infinitesimal generators of the su(2 ) group , _",
    "i.e. _ , elements of the corresponding algebra .",
    "this is not the case since the generators are traceless . however ,",
    "if we had defined @xmath32 as an element of the algebra , the hamiltonian would only change by a constant and we use the more convenient definition  ( [ 11s3 ] ) .",
    "the group su(2 ) is generalized to su(@xmath1 ) for any even @xmath1 .",

    "( ii ) the @xmath345 contribution has a typical energy scale of @xmath390 since excitations of energy @xmath390 ( and higher ) are removed by the second constraint ( [ 21c4b ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the @xmath142 integral over @xmath381 is well - behaved for large @xmath142 so that a cutoff , which is necessary for the @xmath124 and @xmath174 contributions , does not change the result appreciably but would complicate the calculations .",
    "figure [ fig232 ] shows the magnetization for @xmath254 and @xmath255 as a function of @xmath256 .",
    "the @xmath345 fluctuations win over the other contributions ; the magnetization is larger than the mf result .",
    "we see that the o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 expansion gives much better results than the su(@xmath1 ) model except at low temperatures . at small @xmath256",
    "the magnetization seems to be unphysically large , especially for smaller fields . at moderate temperatures the o(@xmath1 )",
    "@xmath2 magnetization is better than both mf results . at high temperatures ,",
    "the monte carlo data consistently fall slightly below the o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 and , for @xmath391 , even below the o(@xmath1 ) mf results .",
    "recall that the su(@xmath1 ) mf approximation works well at low temperatures because it coincides with the non - interacting magnon approximation for the heisenberg model , whereas the o(@xmath1 ) mf magnetization does not .",
    "the @xmath2 corrections for the o(@xmath1 ) model ( predominantly from @xmath345 at low @xmath107 ) are large and in fact overcompensate for the error made at the mf level .",
    "there is a distinct crossover to the moderate @xmath107 regime , where su(@xmath1 ) mf becomes too large , su(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 becomes quite wrong , and o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 is rather good .",
    "in fact it is surprisingly good considering that @xmath2 is not really small .",
    "it is not fully clear why the o(@xmath1 ) model works better than the su(@xmath1 ) model at moderate and high temperatures .",
    "the reason may lie in the different behavior of gauge ( @xmath174 ) fluctuations in the two models.@xcite in the su(@xmath1 ) model they are massless in general , whereas for o(@xmath1 ) they are massless only because the mf value of @xmath299 happens to vanish for this particular system . in both cases",
    "the zero mass leads to an overestimate of fluctuations at the @xmath2 level .",
    "however , in the o(@xmath1 ) model fluctuations in @xmath299 are available to compensate for this , thereby partly restoring the effect a massive gauge field would have .",
    "one might think that o(@xmath1 ) should be worse since the o(@xmath1 ) model for @xmath392 does not have skyrmions , whereas the su(@xmath1 ) model has them for all @xmath1.@xcite however , the @xmath2 expansion does not contain these non - perturbative effects anyway . on the other hand",
    ", they are , in principle , captured by the monte carlo simulations.@xcite    the deviations between o(@xmath1 ) results and monte carlo data at high temperatures and @xmath391 or larger ( see fig .",
    "[ mfig ] ) are probably due to thermally created skyrmions or to the fact that the simulations are done on a lattice , whereas the @xmath2 calculations use a continuum approximation .",
    "the dispersion of the former is a cosine band if bosonized , whereas the latter has parabolic dispersion .",
    "both effects should become important for temperatures @xmath393 since both the band width and the typical skyrmion energy are of the order of @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , the deviations start at @xmath394 .",
    "( in the same region higher order gradient terms not included in the heisenberg model should become important . )",
    "we have also investigated the universal dependence on @xmath103 and @xmath104 . whereas the mf results exhibit this universality , it is violated by small logarithmic corrections at the @xmath2 level for both models , as expected.@xcite    our results can be compared with the microscopic approach of kasner and macdonald,@xcite which includes spin - wave corrections to the electronic self - energy .",
    "this approach is microscopically better justified than the heisenberg model .",
    "however , the magnetization from ref .",
    "is consistently too large and even mf su(@xmath1 ) and o(@xmath1 ) results agree better with monte carlo data .",
    "comparison to nmr experiments by barrett _",
    "et al_.@xcite shows a number of discrepancies . at low temperature ,",
    "the experimental data look flat , whereas at high @xmath107 they drop well below the theoretical results .",
    "these discrepancies are mainly due to the scaling of the data , which is done by setting the measured magnetization , which is reduced by disorder , to @xmath7 in the limit @xmath395 .",
    "recent magnetoabsorption measurements by manfra _",
    "et al_.@xcite show better agreement with our results . in fig .",
    "[ mfig ] we compare data of ref .   with su(@xmath1 ) , o(@xmath1 ) , and quantum monte carlo results . in the calculations",

    "the experimental data show more noise but lie mostly above the o(@xmath1 ) @xmath2 curve .",
    "this discrepancy for @xmath397 is probably due to neglected higher gradient terms in eq .",
    "( [ 11h1 ] ) .",
    "the experimental system is a continuous itinerant magnet , which probably explains the deviations from monte carlo lattice simulations .",
    "we have calculated @xmath2 corrections to large @xmath1 schwinger boson mean field theories for the two - dimensional ferromagnetic heisenberg model , meant to describe a quantum hall system at filling factor @xmath0 .",
    "normal ordering of operators has to be carefully taken into account to obtain the corrections . using a o(@xmath1 ) model",
    ", we find reasonable agreement of the @xmath2 corrected magnetization with both quantum monte carlo simulations@xcite and experiments@xcite at moderate and higher temperatures . at low temperatures ,",
    "the su(@xmath1 ) model works better since it reproduces the correct low - energy physics .",
    "however , the su(@xmath1 ) model does not describe the data anywhere else , confirming auerbach s remark that large @xmath1 methods are `` either surprisingly successful or completely wrong.''@xcite effects of thermally created skyrmions , which are not included in our approach , are small . away from filling factor @xmath0 , skyrmions are present in the ground state and should be important .",
