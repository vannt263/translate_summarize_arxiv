    "it has become widely accepted that dusty protoplanetary disks are heated by radiation from the central star , and that this heating mainly determines the physical structure of the outer regions of these disks . observed infrared spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of the t tauri disks imply that their effective temperatures @xmath0 decreases with disk radius @xmath1 more slowly than @xmath2 .",
    "this temperature distributions is usually explained by a model in which the thermal structure of the disk is assumed to be geometrically flared , i.e. , the surface height @xmath3 where stellar radiation is absorbed curves away from the midplane ( or equivalently @xmath4 , with @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "the outer regions of these disks are irradiated by the central star @xcite and the flaring enables the disks to absorb more radiation from the central star . in a steady state , the flaring index @xmath6 of a purely irradiated optically - thick disk can be obtained from the balance between intercepted stellar flux @xmath7 incident on the surface at a low angle @xmath8 and emitted blackbody flux from the disk interior , under the assumptions that 1 ) the surface height @xmath3 is everywhere proportional to the vertical gas scale height @xmath9 , 2 ) the intercepted fraction of stellar radiation is the sine of the local grazing angle ( @xmath10 ) , and 3 ) the central star is a point source . under these circumstances , there is a self - consistent power - law solution with @xmath11 , which corresponds to @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition to this particular power - law solution , there exists an one - parameter family of solutions for the disk structure , including the diverging aspect - ratio solutions and the asymptotically conical ( in which @xmath13 ) solutions @xcite .",
    "small variations in the values of @xmath3 at inner radii where the integration starts can cause large differences in the disk structure at large radii .",
    "@xcite speculated that such a sensitive nature of the steady solutions is suggestive to an intrinsic instability which must be analyzed with time - dependent governing equations .",
    "more realistic steady solutions can be obtained numerically or semi - analytically to take into account the effects of the finite values of stellar radius , the disk optical depth , and the viscous dissipation associated with the mass - accretion flow ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the most important novel feature of these series of second - generation models is the assumed presence of superheated surface dust layers above and below the disk midplane @xcite .",
    "grains in these layers are directly exposed to the stellar flux .",
    "grains much smaller than the peak wavelength of the self emission are superheated because of their low emissivity .",
    "the disk interior is heated by the superheated dust of the layers rather than directly by the central star .",
    "the two - layer disk model clearly explain the silicate and water - ice emission bands in observed seds of herbig ae / be stars and t tauri stars @xcite .",
    "but , in spite of their triumph in the modeling of the observed seds , these models self - consistently , but these calculations are based on the grazing - angle approximation and the assumption that @xmath14 changes slowly with radius . ] are based on the assumption that @xmath3 is proportional to the gas scale height @xmath9 , with a fixed constant of proportionality @xmath15 @xcite . while this assumption has been justified by estimates which suggest that changes of @xmath14 is small throughout the disk , the amount of dust in the superheated layer is very sensitive function of @xmath14 .",
    "this dependence arises because the dust spatial density at @xmath16 is proportional to @xmath17 $ ] .",
    "thus , the fixed-@xmath14 assumption may cause large discrepancy in determined values of @xmath3 .    in previous analyses , the magnitude @xmath7 is directly determined from the grazing angle @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this approximation justified only in the case that the length of absorption layer ( say , where the optical depth to the starlight changes from 0.1 to 1 ) along the starlight is smaller than the lengths of radial variations of surface density or temperature .",
    "this condition would not be satisfied if the disk surface contains fluctuations resulting from the growth of short - wavelength perturbations ( see   [ sec : simple ] ) .    in principle",
    ", @xmath3 is determined by the condition that the visual optical depth , which can be obtained by a direct integration along the rays of starlight , is unity and the surface filling factor @xmath18 of the irradiated dust grains can be calculated through the vertical ( in the direction normal to the disk plane ) integration of geometrical opacity times mass density from @xmath3 to infinity .",
    "this global procedure yields @xmath3 at any given radius which depends not only on the local value of @xmath9 but also the disk structure interior to that radius .",
    "thus , @xmath19 varies both in space and time . following this procedure",
    ", we can check for self consistency by recalculating @xmath3 based on the temperature distribution obtained from the steady , constant-@xmath14 model . with this inductive approach ,",
    "we demonstrate that there are substantial differences between the iterated values of @xmath3 and the initial , assumed values of @xmath20 .",
    "we also find that @xmath18 calculated from the deduced values of @xmath3 is substantially different from the values of @xmath21 extrapolated from the constant-@xmath14 model .",
    "since the irradiation heating can play such a major role in determining the vertical structure of protoplanetary disks , it is important to investigate the stability of such disks against the excitation of ripples on their surfaces . under the assumption that the thermal timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale in protostellar disks",
    ", @xcite investigated the thermal stability of the irradiation - dominated disks , using a simple cooling equation .",
    "they found the vertically isothermal disk to be stable against finite amplitude perturbations .",
    "the initial temperature perturbations propagate inward and damp out quickly . however , in their analysis , they assumed that @xmath14 is constant throughout the disk and @xmath7 is given by @xmath8 as in the grazing angle approximation .",
    "the inferred stability in that study may depend on these assumptions . as we will see in ",
    "[ sec : simple ] , changes in @xmath14 may lead to an instability .    with a linear perturbation analysis",
    ", @xcite showed that the flaring disk solution may become unstable to infinitesimal hydrodynamic perturbations when the cooling time of the disk is much shorter than the dynamical time ( the opposite limit of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the amplitude of inwardly propagating waves grows exponentially with a rate that is a decreasing function of the wavelength .",
    "subsequently , @xcite constructed a series of numerical models to examine the two - dimensional structure and evolution of protoplanetary disks around herbig ae / be stars . in these simulations , they studied the radiative transfer process under the assumption that the disk always maintains a hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "( this assumption would not be appropriate for the limit that the time scale of cooling is shorter than that of dynamics . )",
    "they found two sets of asymptotically steady - state results which include the monotonically flaring solutions and the self - shadowed solutions .",
    "for the second set of solutions , the disk has a puffed - up inner rim .",
    "they stated that their iteration procedure , in which the hydrostatic equilibrium and the radiative transfer are treated separately in alternate steps , may not , under some circumstances , lead to a set of converged solutions . in their simulations ,",
    "some wave - like disturbances appear to propagate over the disk from one iterative step to the next and these transitory features are never damped out completely .",
    "although they limited their presentations on disks around herbig ae / be stars , where the perturbation on the disk structure by these waves are relatively minor , they revealed that this problem appears to be more serious for disks around t tauri stars .",
    "we speculate that this perturbation may be related to the above - mentioned instabilities operating in the irradiation - dominated outer regions of protostellar disks .    in this paper , we attempt to address two issues : 1 ) are the steady - state solutions of irradiated disks constructed by the previous one - dimensional models self - consistent and stable ?",
    "2 ) do these regions of disks tend to undergo quasi - periodic oscillations rather than attain an asymptotic steady state ? in principle , these questions should be addressed with comprehensive two- or three - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "such an approach is , however , fairly complicated , time consuming , and often plagued with problems in the algorithm which implements the radiative transfer processes ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "prior to these detailed simulations , it is useful to identify the dominant effects which regulate the dynamics of irradiated disks with a set of one - dimensional time - dependent analyses on the thermal evolution of protostellar disks .",
    "since thermal timescale is much shorter than viscous diffusion timescale , most previous studies adopted the assumption of thermal equilibrium during the course of disks global evolution .",
    "nevertheless , there have been a few investigations on the thermal evolution of protoplanetary disks .",
    "@xcite investigated the cooling and quasi - static contraction of the protoplanetary disks from an initial high - temperature state .",
    "they performed vertical one - dimensional numerical calculations and found that the cooling times are well estimated by a simple two - temperature ( surface and interior temperatures ) prescription . in this paper , we utilize this two - layer disk - temperature prescription to examine the stability and thermal evolution of irradiated disks .",
    "the simplest treatments for the thermal evolution of the irradiated disk are radial one - dimensional models in which the vertical structure of the disk at each radii is analyzed independently . in order to take into account of the irradiated surface and the disk interior ,",
    "we evaluate the surface height directly from the location where the visual optical depth along the straight lines from the star is unity .",
    "we show that such disks evolve to quasi - periodic states in which thermal waves propagate inward through intermediate disk radii , where planets are formed .",
    "a simple discussion about the nature of thermal instability is given in ",

    ". the basic assumption of our model and its governing equations are presented in ",
    "[ sec : basic ] .",
    "the results of our numerical calculations are presented in   [ sec : results ] for both simple and realistic opacities",
    ". finally , we summarize our findings and discuss some possible evolutionary scenarios .",
    "in this section , we discuss some potential causes for irradiation - dominated regions of disks to become thermally unstable . for illustration convenience , we adopt the following simplifying assumptions : 1 ) the star is a point source , 2 ) the disk s internal heat sources such as turbulent viscous heating as well as external heating other than the stellar radiation are negligible , 3 ) the optical depth of the disk is much larger than unity for both stellar radiation and its own emission , and 4 ) the transport of energy in the radial direction is much smaller than that in the vertical direction .",
    "note that these assumptions are adopted only in this section for the purpose of pinpointing the physical process which leads to the thermal instability .",
    "all of these idealized assumptions will be relaxed in the numerical simulations to be presented below .    under these assumptions ,",
    "we consider the heat balance in a geometrically thin disk which is irradiated by the central star .",
    "the energy equation reduces to @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the specific heat per unit disk mass , @xmath24 is the surface density of the disk , and @xmath25 is the temperature of the disk interior . under assumption 2",
    ", the disk interior has an approximately isothermal structure and @xmath26 is the disk blackbody emission given by @xmath27 and @xmath7 is the intercepted stellar flux given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , @xmath30 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath1 is the cylindrical radial coordinate , and @xmath18 is the total emitting area - filling factor of superheated dust grains .",
    "the factor 1/2 in the right - hand side of equation  ( [ eq : fs1 ] ) comes from the fact that surface irradiated dust re - radiate half of the absorbed stellar flux toward the disk interior ( the rest toward infinity ) . assuming a homogeneous mixing of gas and dust , we can obtain @xmath18 from ( see appendix  [ sec : estimate ] ) @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the complimentary error function",
    ", @xmath33 is the geometrical optical depth of the disk midplane , and @xmath3 is the surface height where stellar radiation is absorbed .",
    "the ratio of the surface height @xmath3 to the gas scale height @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath34 . in a hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the gas scale height @xmath9 is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the disk sound speed , @xmath37 is the keplerian angular velocity , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath39 is the molecular weight of disk gas , @xmath40 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath41 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath42 is the stellar mass .",
    "figure  [ fig : fmfs ] displays the @xmath26 and @xmath7 ( at @xmath43 ) as functions of @xmath25 .",
    "assuming that the initial state is in a thermal equilibrium ( corresponding to the point where three thick lines cross ) with @xmath44 , we impose a small positive temperature perturbation .",
    "we consider two extreme cases : 1 ) if @xmath3 is determined by the local disk structure , @xmath19 would retain a constant value during the increase of @xmath25 such that @xmath18 would also be constant ( see eq .",
    "[ [ eq : assec2 ] ] ) and @xmath7 would not change ( _ dot - dashed line _ ) . in this case the system would be stabilized because @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "2 ) if @xmath3 is determined mostly by the attenuation by dust in the inner regions of the disk , @xmath3 would remain constant despite changes in the local disk temperature and @xmath9 such that @xmath18 would increase rapidly and @xmath7 would increase much faster than @xmath26 ( _ thick dash curve _ ) . in this case the system would be unstable because @xmath47 for @xmath48 .    in their stability analysis , @xcite assumed a constant @xmath14 .",
    "based on the above analysis , this assumption naturally leads to stable solutions .",
    "in fact , most of the analysis on the structure of irradiated disks are based on the constant-@xmath14 assumption ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the usual procedure to determine @xmath3 is based on a geometrical consideration , i.e , @xmath49 where @xmath8 is the grazing angle ( i.e. , the angle between the starlight and the disk surface ) .",
    "we refer this procedure to be the grazing - angle approximation .",
    "most previous steady - state disk models are constructed with equation  ( [ eq : astheta ] ) under the assumption that @xmath14 is constant throughout the disk .",
    "however , the magnitude of @xmath14 is generally determined by the radial structure of the disk as well as its local properties .",
    "the surface height @xmath3 is determined by the optical depth integrated through a ray of the stellar radiation .",
    "we derive a ray integral and check the validity of equation  ( [ eq : astheta ] ) in   [ sec : basic ] and appendix  [ sec : estimate ] . in principle , equations  ( [ eq : assec2 ] ) and ( [ eq : astheta ] ) must be resolved simultaneously @xcite . however , this set of equations is fairly unstable to solve numerically because they do not contain contributions which may reduce any steep temperature gradients in the radial direction .",
    "steep temperature gradient , if present , would invalidate the constant @xmath14 and the grazing - angle approximations .",
    "physically , the radial transport of heat suppresses the radial temperature gradient , but such a process through the opaque regions of the disk must be analyzed with multi - dimensional numerical simulations .",
    "one of the most efficient process of the radial heat transport is the radiative transfer from the superheated dust grains at the surface of any radial location to the disk midplane at adjacent radial regions . using a simple one - dimensional model",
    ", we can take this oblique radiative transfer of heat into account .",
    "following the approaches of @xcite and @xcite , we construct numerical models to study the thermal evolution of a protostellar accretion disk .",
    "the surface of the disk is illuminated by the central star . exposed to the stellar radiation ,",
    "sub - mm dust grains in the surface layers of the disk are superheated .",
    "we consider the case that dust mass of the disk is so large that the disk midplane ( except for an innermost region where silicates are evaporated ) is optically thick to the stellar radiation .",
    "in contrast to the previous section , the heat sources for the disk interior in these numerical models include both irradiation from the superheated grains on the disk surface and the viscous dissipation associated with the accretion flow .",
    "we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath50 in which the @xmath51 plane represents the disk midplane and the origin is at the location of the central star .",
    "since the star - and - disk system is symmetric with respect to the midplane , we describe our results for the upper half of the disk only .    in order to simplify the problem",
    "we adopt the two - layer axisymmetric disk model proposed by @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the disk consists of a surface superheated layer where the dust temperature is @xmath52 and a disk interior where the dust and gas temperature is assumed to be uniform at @xmath53 .",
    "this model is simple to use and includes all the essential ingredient to analyze the onset , evolution , and stabilization of thermal instability in protostellar disks .",
    "however , such a simplification would be invalid if the disk optical depth @xmath54 to its intrinsic radiation is much larger than unity and viscous heating rate is larger than surface heating rate .",
    "however , the dust optical depth may be self - limited by their rapid growth through cohesive collisions , so that @xmath55 throughout the disk ( see fig .  6 in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "thus , the two - layer model is valid even in the inner disk where dust surface density is larger .",
    "the two - layer model is invalid at the inner edge of the disk , where disk is irradiated not only from the top but from the radial direction .",
    "the disk may have a puffed - up inner rim ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but a set of two - dimensional radiative transfer calculations is needed to determine the structure of the innermost region . in this work",
    "we simply assume that disk within @xmath56 is optically thick in the radial direction and has no puffed - up rim that might cast shadows over the outer regions of the disk .",

    "along a ray from the surface of the star , the superheated layer extends outward until the position where visual optical depth has reached unity .",

    "<S> protoplanetary disks are mainly heated by radiation from the central star . </S>",
    "<S> since the incident stellar flux at any radius is sensitive to the disk structure near that location , an unstable feedback may be present . </S>",
    "<S> previous investigations show that the disk would be stable to finite - amplitude temperature perturbations if the vertical height of optical surface is everywhere directly proportional to the gas scale height and if the intercepted fraction of stellar radiation is determined from the local grazing angle . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these assumptions may not be generally applicable . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we calculate the quasi - static thermal evolution of irradiated disks by directly integrating the global optical depths to determine the optical surface and the total emitting area - filling factor of surface dust . </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in disks with modest mass accretion rates , thermal waves are spontaneously and continually excited in the outer disk , propagate inward through the planet - forming domains , and dissipated at small radii where viscous dissipation is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> this state is quasi - periodic over several thermal timescales and its pattern does not depend on the details of the opacity law . </S>",
    "<S> the viscous dissipation resulting from higher mass accretion stabilizes this instability such that an approximately steady state is realized throughout the disk . in passive protostellar disks , especially transitional disks , </S>",
    "<S> these waves induce significant episodic changes in seds , on the time scales of years to decades , because the midplane temperatures can vary by a factor of two between the exposed and shadowed regions . the transitory peaks and troughs in the potential vorticity distribution </S>",
    "<S> may also lead to baroclinic instability and excite turbulence in the planet - forming regions . </S>"
