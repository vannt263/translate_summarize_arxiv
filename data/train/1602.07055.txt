    "the time evolution of the higgs mode in the collisionless , dissipationless regime was studied intensely .",
    "it was revealed that the higgs mode oscillates at a frequency of @xmath3 with a @xmath0 decaying property in the weak coupling limit , where @xmath4 is the asymptotic value of superconducting gap @xcite . however , previous works all assume that the density of states ( dos ) near the fermi level is almost a constant within the debye cut - off energy @xmath5 .",
    "this assumption obviously fails for honeycomb lattice or dirac semimetals at half filling .",
    "their dos is either linear ( 2d ) or quadratic ( 3d ) at low energy , respectively , and vanishes at the dirac point@xcite .",
    "since superconductivity is strongly affected by the dos near the fermi level , it would be theoretically interesting to study the time evolution of higgs mode in those systems .",
    "on the experimental side , the availability of the honeycomb optical lattice@xcite and the tunable attractive interaction by feshbash resonance@xcite give a possible test ground for this study .",
    "besides , the expected unique feature of the higgs mode in superconducting dirac semimetal can be used as an important experimental characterization to distinguish it from the normal superconductors@xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the quenched dynamics in the weak coupling limit by using the anderson pseudo - spin formalism@xcite .",
    "we find that the higgs mode has a log - decay behaviour in the half - filling honeycomb lattice .",

    "therefore , for the two instances of time separated by @xmath100 , the whole pseudo - spins configuration is identical . since @xmath49 depends explicitly on the sum of @xmath101 component of all the pseudo - spins , it must be periodic and undamped .",
    "compared with 2d case at half filling , the particle - hole continuum most responsible for the damping consist a even smaller fraction of the whole phase space .",
    "therefore , the damping originating from the interaction with those states is negligible .",
    "we note that the above discussion is for the singlet pairing case .",
