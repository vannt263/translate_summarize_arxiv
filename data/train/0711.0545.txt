    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ) is an on - going project conducted at the arecibo observatory . using the 305 m telescope and the seven - beam alfa receiver",
    ", the survey aims at covering 7000 deg@xmath0 of high galactic latitude sky in order to detect some 20,000 extragalactic hi - bearing objects @xcite .",
    "as first illustrated in @xcite , the survey makes significant improvement over previous blind hi surveys in terms of sensitivity , resolution , and number of detections .",
    "earlier this year , in a first alfalfa data release , we presented a catalog of 730 hi detections for the northern virgo cluster region @xcite .",
    "of these detections , only @xmath8 are present in the northern hipass catalog @xcite over the same area of the sky , and @xmath9 of the cataloged sources are new hi detections .",
    "clearly , the contribution of alfalfa is significant .",
    "the survey was designed to cover a wide variety of cosmic environments .",
    "the `` spring '' alfalfa survey covers the right ascension range from 7.5 to 16.5 hours , which includes several nearby overdensities such as the virgo cluster , the coma cluster and the leo group , while the `` fall '' survey maps the region from 22 to 3 hours of right ascension over most of the declination range accessible from arecibo ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this region includes the pisces - perseus supercluster and also a large nearby cosmic void in its foreground .",
    "we present in this paper a first catalog of galaxies from this `` fall '' survey . during the first season of alfalfa observing ,",
    "all observations necessary to obtain full coverage over a @xmath11 wide strip were completed .",
    "this specific region of sky , centered on @xmath12 and stretching from @xmath13h to @xmath14h , was chosen to begin the survey observations because it was already targeted during the alfalfa precursor observations @xcite , it goes through the very nearby galaxy group ngc672 , it covers the southernmost portion of the pisces - perseus supercluster ridge , and surveys a large nearby void .",
    "the scientific goals and applications of alfalfa are very broad and diverse @xcite ; an important one is the determination of the hi mass function ( himf ) , and its dependence on environment .",
    "several blind hi surveys have been used to address this question , both using single dish telescopes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and synthesis arrays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while there is no consensus yet on the slope of the faint end of the himf ( for a recent compilation of the different results , see *",
    "* ) , the different surveys measure an abundance of low - mass hi systems that is far less than the number of low - mass dark matter halos produced by numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . with its sensitivity and large sky coverage , alfalfa should detect hundreds of galaxies with hi masses less than @xmath15m@xmath16 , compared to the handful contained in other surveys , and should therefore help determine with high confidence the abundance of low - mass hi systems in the local universe and put constraints on the `` missing satellites '' problem .",
    "there is another related problem when it comes to comparing observations of galaxies with the predicted abundances from simulations , which can also be addressed by alfalfa .",
    "this problem concerns the abundance of low - mass systems in underdense regions of space and has been coined as the `` void phenomenon '' @xcite . using numerical simulations",
    ", @xcite find that voids are filled with dark matter filaments , just like denser environments , except that the amplitudes of the perturbations are much smaller .",
    "they predict that a void with a diameter of 20 @xmath17 mpc should contain almost 1000 dark matter haloes with masses of @xmath18 m@xmath16 and about 50 with masses of @xmath19 m@xmath16 .",
    "unless there are mechanisms at play that would inhibit the formation of galaxies in underdense regions of space , there should therefore be a significant population of dwarf galaxies in voids .",
    "such a population has so far not been observed .",
    "@xcite have built a luminosity function of void galaxies using data from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "they do not find any significant dependence of the slope of the faint end of the luminosity function on environment . a steeper slope in the voids would have revealed the existence of a more important population of dwarfs .",
    "if we accept the predictions of the numerical simulations , there are two main avenues to explain the discrepancy with the results of the optical surveys : ( 1 ) the processes that are required to trigger the star formation process in galaxies are not available in voids , or ( 2 ) there is no material out of which these stars could be formed . while the second scenario implies that some physical processes have suppressed star formation in dwarf galaxies by removing their reservoirs of cool gas , according to the first scenario the voids should contain a large number of halos that are filled with hi but devoid of stars , the so - called `` dark galaxies '' .",
    "so far , such a population has not been observed , though a few candidates have been reported @xcite .",
    "after further investigation , these have however all been found to be either associated with or the companions of a faint optical counterpart , or part of the tidal features of neighboring galaxies ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* haynes et al .",
    "2007 in preparation ) .",
    "the largest blind hi survey to date , the hi parkes all sky survey ( hipass , * ? ? ? * ) has failed to find any truly dark galaxies . with a sensitivity greater than that of hipass by a factor of eight ,",
    "alfalfa promises to either find a population of dark galaxies if they exist , or at least to put a much stronger constraint on their abundance . in this paper , we provide a new catalog of hi detections from alfalfa which provides first insight on a slice through the pisces - perseus foreground void and allows us to investigate in a preliminary manner what alfalfa may be telling us about the void phenomenon .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the large - scale structure present in the sky area studied , give an overview of the alfalfa observing and data reduction processes and present a catalog of 488  hi detections . in  3 , we present the properties of the sample and a description of the high velocity cloud population .",
    "finally , in  4 we discuss the implications of the data for the void problem . a value for the hubble constant of 70 km s@xmath20  mpc@xmath20 has been assumed throughout the paper .",
    "we present data for a @xmath11-wide strip of the alfalfa survey , covering a total of 135 deg@xmath0 .",
    "the strip is centered at @xmath21 declination and covers the right ascension range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",
    "observations were made between august and november 2005 and required just over 100 hours of telescope time .",
    "the declination strip to be first observed as part of the alfalfa `` fall '' survey and to be presented in this data release was selected both for technical and scientific reasons .",
    "the part of this strip between @xmath24 to @xmath25 was surveyed in a shared - risk mode during fall 2004 as part of the alfalfa precursor observations @xcite .",
    "this specific region was selected then , because with a moderate zenith angle of @xmath26 , both sensitivity and pointing accuracy of the telescope were maximized .",
    "for these same reasons , to complete the coverage over the full ra range , and to assess the performance of the full alfalfa infrastructure that was perfected during these precursor observations , the strip was retargeted when the full survey was initiated .    in order to get some early science results ,",
    "this declination range was also chosen because it allows the study of interesting features of the local universe , the nearby galaxy group ngc672/ic1727 for example .",
    "it also allows us to start studying several important features of the large scale structure .",
    "the pisces - perseus supercluster ( pps ) is one of the most prominent nearby extragalactic features .",
    "the main ridge of the cluster stretches for at least @xmath27mpc , has a very large axial ratio with a width in the plane of the sky of only @xmath28mpc @xcite , and stretches almost perpendicularly to the line of sight .",
    "the southernmost part of the ridge crosses the sky area studied here . in the late-80 s",
    ", a large project was undertaken to obtain redshifts for a large number of spiral galaxies in the pps region .",
    "hi 21 cm spectra were obtained using the arecibo telescope @xcite for these galaxies selected from the _ catalog of galaxies and clusters of galaxies _ ( cgcg * ? ? ?",
    "redshift measurements show a significant enhancement in the distribution of galaxies at @xmath29 km s@xmath20 , and a large underdensity in the foreground over the entire pps area they surveyed .",
    "radio synthesis observations were also conducted over a set of twelve selected field in the direction of the pps by @xcite , these authors concluded that the properties of the galaxies in their hi - selected sample did not differ substantially from those of late - type galaxies found in optical surveys .",
    "they also report that while 16 objects were detected in the supercluster region , none were detected over the same volume and down to the same mass sensitivity limit of @xmath30m@xmath6  in the foreground void .",
    "this void in the foreground of pps was first identified by @xcite . using a total of nearly 3000 galaxies with redshifts",
    ", they recognized the filamentary structure in the distribution of galaxies in and around pps , the presence of narrow structures appearing to connect pps and the local supercluster , but mostly the void nature of a major portion of the foreground between pps an the local supercluster .",
    "that void is most prominent at declinations between @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where most of the volume between 22h and 3h and extending from @xmath33 km s@xmath20  to @xmath34 km s@xmath20  is empty . at lower declinations , there also appears to be underdense regions at @xmath35 km s@xmath20  ( see fig.2 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "alfalfa observations are conducted at the arecibo telescope and the 7-feed alfa receiver . as described elsewhere @xcite , data acquisition for alfalfa",
    "is done in a fixed azimuth drift scan mode .",
    "each sky tile is covered in two partly - overlapping drifts at two different epochs in order to achieve better than nyquist sampling . moreover , since the two passes are separated in time by several months , comparing the data from the two epochs can help in ruling out spurious detections . when data acquisition is completed over a given region of the sky , the individual drift scans are assembled and regridded to form three - dimensional data cubes or `` grids '' .",
    "these grids are @xmath36 in size with 1  sampling , and have 1024 channels along the spectral axis .",
    "since the velocity resolution is @xmath37 km s@xmath20(before hanning smoothing ) , in order to cover the full alfalfa velocity range which extends from -2000 to 18,000 km s@xmath20 , each grid is separated in four redshift subgrids , respectively covering the ranges : -2000 to 3300  km s@xmath20 , 2500 to 7900  km s@xmath20 , 7200 to 12800  km s@xmath20 , and 12100 to 17900  km s@xmath20 .",
    "we present here the detections made in 38 such grids .",
    "the full data reduction and gridding process will be presented in detail in giovanelli et al .",
    "( 2008 , in preparation ) .",
    "signals were identified using the alfalfa automated signal extraction tool , that creates a catalog of candidate detections by convolving in fourier space the data with templates build from a combination of hermite functions @xcite .",
    "galactic emission is fitted and subtracted to allow for the detection of objects with very low recession velocities . in cases where an extragalactic signal straddles the spectral window contaminated by galactic emission ,",
    "an interpolation tool is used before parameters such as width and flux can be measured .",
    "each of the candidate detections was then examined , measured , and cross - correlated with dss2 , ned , and the agc ( `` arecibo general catalog '' , a database of galaxies maintained by m.p.h and r.g . ) .",
    "no data is available from the _ sloan digital sky survey _ over this part of the sky .",
    "optical counterparts were at this point assigned to the hi detections , mostly unambiguously due to the pointing accuracy and good spatial resolution of the survey .",
    "figure [ pointing ] shows the pointing offsets between measured hi coordinates and the positions of the optical counterparts , in four different @xmath38 bins .",
    "a correction has been applied to account for the systematic pointing errors of the telescope by comparing the observed positions of continuum sources with those given in the nvss catalog @xcite .",
    "after this correction , the median pointing offsets for all detections in the catalog is 19 , while the error is reduced to 14  for detections with @xmath39 .",
    "the outliers seen in figure [ pointing ] are detections made in the vicinity of other systems , where the centroiding process is complicated by this external contamination . in all cases , a note to that effect",
    "is made in  [ cat ] . given the @xmath40 size of the beam and the spatial resolution of previous large blind hi surveys , the accuracy of the coordinates of the hi detections in the gridded alfalfa data cubes is excellent .",
    "three different types of detections are presented here .",
    "we include in the catalog any detection with @xmath3 made in regions of the data cubes that are not affected by radio frequency interference and where the survey coverage is good .",
    "alfalfa catalogs are better than 95% reliable above this threshold @xcite , and such detections do not require any corroborating follow - up observations ( code 1 in tab .",
    "[ params ] ) .",
    "the second class of objects presented in this catalog has @xmath4 , but a previously measured optical redshift with which the hi measurement agrees ( code 2 in tab .",
    "[ params ] ) .",
    "we consider that this prior information significantly increases the reliability of these detections , to the point where they can also be included in this catalog without further observations .",
    "finally , we also include high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) , which in this part of the sky are all found to have large negative recession velocities ( code 9 ) .",
    "these hvcs are discussed in more detail in  [ hvc ] .",
    "figure 2 of @xcite shows examples of hi line profiles corresponding to the different code assignments .",

    "finally , column 7 gives two estimates of the hi mass , based on each of the distance values , and column 8 the group membership .",
    "we note that the distances produced by the peculiar velocity model are inferior to the primary distances , which leads to an underestimate of the hi masses .",
    "since the primary distances should be trusted over the peculiar velocity - inferred ones , this second mass estimate is adopted .",
    "the total mass in hi contained in the six galaxies of the ngc672 group detected by alfalfa is @xmath91 m@xmath6 , of which 97% is contained in the two large members of the group , ngc672 and ic1727 .",
    "the ngc672 group is briefly considered by @xcite in a study of neighboring galaxy groups , even though no mass estimate is given on the grounds that accurate distances for individual members of groups located within 5 and 10 mpc are not of satisfactory quality .",
    "there is a second group , or rather association of dwarfs , in the vicinity of the ngc672 group .",
    "the main member of this group is the dwarf galaxy ngc784 , which is estimated to be at a distance of 5.0 mpc , based on the luminosity of the brightest blue stars @xcite .",
    "the dwarf agc111977 is located @xmath92 to the east of ngc672 and @xmath93 to the south - west of ngc784 ( see figure [ groups_plot ] ) . with a recession velocity of 207 km",
    "s@xmath20  and a tip of the red giant branch distance of 4.7 mpc @xcite , it is identified as a member of the ngc784 group @xcite . in table [ ngc672tab ] we give the parameters for three confirmed members of the ngc784 group , including two which are not found in table [ params ] because their declination is outside of the range studied here .",
    "they are ngc784 itself , and its satellite companion agc111164 .",
    "these three members of the ngc784 group are plotted as filled symbols in figure [ groups_plot ] . in their study of nearby dwarf galaxies associations , @xcite identify another galaxy with the ngc784 group , ugc1281 which is located 4.5 degrees ( which is @xmath94 kpc at the distance of the group ) away from ngc784 and far out of the declination strip surveyed here . using information on distances and redshifts for these four members ,",
    "they derive a virial mass of @xmath95 m@xmath6  for the ngc784 group , but not without saying that such a group is unlikely to be in dynamical equilibrium and therefore shedding some doubt on the validity of any mass calculations for these small associations . furthermore ,",
    "as seen in figure [ groups_plot ] , the groups have very few members , and these few members do not seem to form relaxed structures .",
    "@xcite identifies galaxies of the ngc672 and ngc784 groups to the triangulum spur , suggesting that they may all be part of a larger structure .",
    "just as it did for the very low mass , low surface brightness dwarf agc112521 , we are hoping that alfalfa will detect additional members of these groups , outside of the sky area covered here , to help us trace the relation between the different groups in this region of space .",
    "as an example of that , we note that we also detect in the vicinity of ngc784 several hi clouds with recession velocity in the range of 30 to 50 km s@xmath20 .",
    "just like ngc784 and agc111164 , these detections are made outside of the declination range covered in this data release and therefore are not included in table [ params ] .",
    "the two most interesting candidate extragalactic objects are however presented as the last two items in table [ ngc672tab ] . the first detection is made only 1.1  to the north of the 2mass galaxy j02034519 + 2910528 , but due to the relatively large size of the offset ( see fig . [ pointing ] ) and the significant spatial extent of the hi emission , the association is most likely coincidental .",
    "the other candidate detection has no apparent optical counterpart .",
    "if at the distance of ngc784 , these two objects would have hi masses consistent with those of the known members of the group .",
    "follow - up observations to come will try to corroborate the association of these two systems with the ngc784 group , even though the relatively large velocity offset between these two clouds and the other members of the group as well as the known population of galactic clouds with similar velocities seem to argue against such an association .",

    "we distinguish between high negative velocity ( filled symbols ) and low velocity ( open symbols ) detections for each of the four catalogs ( alfalfa : circles , ww91 : squares , dbb02 : triangles , l02 : star , bt04 : upside - down triangles ) .",
    "there are three detections reported by ww91 in and around the alfalfa sky area analyzed here , and eight by dbb02 , which are all summarized in table [ hvctab ] .",
    "the detections of both ww91 and dbb02 just above @xmath110 and below @xmath98 are confirmed by alfalfa but not included in this data release .",
    "the northernmost feature is the main body of wright s cloud .",
    "the third cloud from ww91 , ww432 , is also found in the alfalfa data ( object 2 - 283 in tab.[params ] ) .",
    "however , there is a significant discrepancy with the rest of the detections of dbb02 . their three reported detections with @xmath111 km s@xmath20   ( hvc293 , hvc395 and hvc499 in the dbb02 catalog ) are not detected by alfalfa .",
    "in fact , alfalfa makes no detections of high velocity clouds with positive recession velocity in this region of the sky . with the fluxes given by dbb02 all in excess of 30 jy km s@xmath20",
    ", these sources should have easily been detected in our survey .",
    "the same is true for hvc286 reported by dbb02 to be at @xmath112 km s@xmath20 , though in this case given the poor spatial resolution of the survey of dbb02 it is not entirely impossible that alfalfa would have detected the cloud if it s coverage had extended below 22h in ra .",
    "finally , we observe hi emission consistent with hvc408 , which seems part of a large filament that blends in with the main galactic emission , and as such has not been measured and reported in table [ params ] as an hvc .",
    "only three of the lines of sight observed by l02 go through our surveyed sky area .",
    "they report one detection , which is confirmed by alfalfa and measured as sources 2 - 414 and 2 - 417 .",
    "these ultra compact hvcs are typical of the clouds detected in our survey , with dimensions of about @xmath113 or less .",
    "the alfalfa @xmath114 hi column density limit for a cloud resolved by the beam , having a velocity width of 20 km s@xmath20  and observed at a spectral resolution of 10 km s@xmath20  is @xmath115 atoms @xmath116 , which is close to that achieved in the very high sensitivity , though small area survey of l02 .",
    "there is a much better agreement between our hvc detections and those of bt04 , who report several detections over the sky area covered here .",
    "our observed distribution of hvc corresponds to the large filaments and loops of hi reported in this study that they associate with the magellanic stream .",
    "we however detect a significant number of knots in the distribution of hi between 22h and 23h that are uncatalogued by bt04 .",
    "these 10 alfalfa detections have integrated fluxes in the range between 0.5 and 1.5 jy km s@xmath20 , while the faintest source in the catalog of bt04 has a flux of 2.8 jy km s@xmath20 .",
    "when alfalfa is completed , it will therefore be possible to extend the detailed hvc survey of bt04 to a sky area 4 times as large and provide a much needed high sensitivity map of the high velocity hi emission .",

    ", we will be able to put strong constraints on the abundance of gas - rich dwarf galaxies in voids to ease the comparison with the predictions of theoretical models and numerical simulations . due to its proximity",
    ", the pisces - perseus foreground void is an excellent environment to look for such dark galaxies .    in figure",
    "[ voidplot ] , we show the distribution of all alfalfa detections and galaxies with optical redshifts smaller than 5000 km s@xmath20 .",
    "first of all , we notice how the distribution of the hi - selected sample closely follows the distribution of the galaxies optically detected .",
    "secondly , we can clearly see a large void region both in the optical and alfalfa data sets .",
    "this region which roughly extends from @xmath22 to @xmath117 and from between @xmath33 to @xmath118 km s@xmath20  contains no galaxies that could be detected either through the optical surveys or with alfalfa .",
    "we used the density field from the iras pscz redshift survey @xcite to confirm the void nature of the selected volume of space .",
    "all the pscz grid points within the volume are underdense compared to the cosmic mean ( @xmath119 ) , with density contrasts in the range of @xmath120 and a median value of @xmath121 , where @xmath122 .    while the size of the dataset currently available does not allow for a reliable quantitative analysis of the situation , because only a fraction of one nearby void has been surveyed , we can already suspect that alfalfa is not going to reveal a large population of dark galaxies in the voids .",
    "the fact that no galaxies were detected by alfalfa in a large volume of 460 mpc@xmath123 of a nearby void , throughout which it is sensitive to objects with hi masses of @xmath7m@xmath6  is a good indication of that . for comparison , by scaling down the predictions for the large voids simulated by @xcite to the volume sampled by our current observations and assuming that @xmath124 of the mass of the dark halos is in the form of hi ( which is admittedly probably a very enthusiastic estimate )",
    ", alfalfa should have detected 38 galaxies with m@xmath125m@xmath6 .",
    "these results for the void phenomenon are also exacerbated by the fact that five of the six lowest mass objects in our sample are satellites of the nearby galaxies ngc672 and ngc784 .",
    "based on these results , there does not seem to be a tendency for low - mass systems to be more uniformly distributed than their more massive counterparts . there is also the fact that all hi detections with @xmath67 have been matched with optical counterparts . unless a number of the hvcs detected are extragalactic as discussed by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is no evidence so far for dark galaxies either as satellites of massive halos or in underdense regions of space .",
    "we present a catalog of 488  hi detections from the alfalfa survey over 135 deg@xmath126 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) . of these ,",
    "49  are identified as hvcs while the remaining 439  are extragalactic and all associated with an optical counterpart .",
    "these matches are made with great confidence due to the relatively high pointing accuracy and spatial resolution of the survey .",
    "of the extragalactic objects , @xmath68 are new detections made by alfalfa and @xmath69 are new redshift measurements .",
    "five of the six objects detected with @xmath82 are satellites of either the galaxy pair ngc672/ic1727 or of their neighbor , the dwarf irregular galaxy ngc784 .",
    "we find no evidence for low - mass optically - dark systems in the vicinity of these large nearby galaxies .",
    "we also do not find them in a 460 mpc@xmath123 slice through a nearby local void in the foreground of the pisces - perseus supercluster .",
    "the non - detection suggests that a large population of hi - rich yet optically - dark galaxies is unlikely to reconcile the discrepancies between the observed abundance of dwarf galaxies in voids and the predictions made on the basis of numerical simulations .",
    "we have also used the alfalfa data to study the hvc population .",
    "in addition to large bright clouds previously cataloged @xcite such as the southern extension of wright s cloud , we detect a large number of ultra compact hvcs which correspond to the large filaments observed by @xcite and associated with a northern extension of the magellanic stream . when completed",
    ", alfalfa and its commensal galactic - alfa survey will be the most sensitive large scale surveys for high velocity clouds , as evidenced by comparing the hvcs found in this catalog to previous detections .",
    "while the data presented here are extracted from only @xmath127 of the full area alfalfa will survey , we have been able to show the potential of the survey not only to significantly increase the number of galaxies for which hi redshifts are available , but also to better our understanding of the population of gas - rich galaxies , to put strong constraints on the abundance of hi - rich but optically - dark galaxies , and even to study the population of hvcs .",
