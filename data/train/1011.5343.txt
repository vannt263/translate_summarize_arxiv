    "financial bubbles are generally defined as transient upward accelerations of price above a fundamental value @xcite .",
    "fundamental value reflects the intrinsic value ( and is sometimes called this ) of the asset itself .",
    "it is ordinarily calculated by summing the future incomes generated by the asset , which are discounted to the present . however , as the future income flow is uncertain and not known in advance , and since the interest rates that should be used to discount future cash flows are bound to change in ways not yet known at the time of the calculation , the fundamental value of the asset is usually hard to estimate . in this sense , identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble remains an unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches @xcite .",
    "the johansen - ledoit - sornette ( jls ) model @xcite provides a flexible framework to detect bubbles and predict changes of regime in the price time series of a financial asset .",
    "it combines ( i ) the economic theory of rational expectation bubbles , ( ii ) behavioral finance on imitation and herding of investors and traders and ( iii ) the mathematical and statistical physics of bifurcations and phase transitions .",
    "the model considers the faster - than - exponential ( power law with finite - time singularity ) increase in asset prices decorated by accelerating oscillations as the main diagnostic of bubbles .",
    "it embodies a positive feedback loop of higher return anticipations competing with negative feedback spirals of crash expectations .",
    "our group has made many successful predictions using jls model , such as the 2006 - 2008 oil bubble @xcite , the chinese index bubble in 2009 @xcite , real estate market in las vegas @xcite , south african stock market bubble @xcite and us repos market @xcite .",
    "we also have recently developed new methods based on this model for forecasting rebounds of the stock market rather than crashes @xcite .    in this paper , we generalize the standard jls model by inferring fundamental value of the stock and crash nonlinearity from bubble calibration .",
    "the new models can not only detect the crash time but also estimate the fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity .",
    "this means that our new model has the ability to identify the presence of a bubble , thereby addressing the problem stated at the beginning of this paper . with the estimated fundamental value",
    ", another famous unsolved problem becomes easier : distinguishing between an exponentially growing fundamental price and an exponentially growing bubble price .",
    "furthermore , the new models can also detect the dynamics of crash after the bubble by specifying how the price evolves towards the fundamental value during the crash .",
    "we test the models using data from three historical bubbles from different markets that ended in significant crashes .",
    "they are : the hong kong hang seng index 1997 crash , the s&p 500 index 1987 crash ( black monday ) and the shanghai composite index 2009 crash .",
    "all results suggest that the new models perform very well in describing bubbles , forecasting their ending times and estimating fundamental value and the crash nonlinearity .",
    "the performance of the new models is tested under both the gaussian residual assumption and non - gaussian residual assumption . under the gaussian residual assumption , nested",
    "hypotheses with the wilks statistics are used and the p - values suggest that models with more parameters are necessary . under non - gaussian residual assumption , we use a bootstrap method to get type i and ii errors of the hypotheses .",
    "all tests confirm that the generalized jls models provide useful improvements over the standard jls model .",
    "the paper is constructed as follows . in section [ sec : jls ] , we introduce the standard jls model and our new generalized jls models .",
    "we then analyze three historical bubbles with the new models in section [ sec : case ] . in section [ sec : stats ] , we compare the generalized models statistically to confirm that these new models provide useful improvements over the standard jls model .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : con ] .",
    "in the jls model @xcite , the dynamics of a given asset is described as @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the asset price , @xmath2 is the drift ( or trend ) and @xmath3 is the increment of a standard wiener process ( with zero mean and unit variance ) .",
    "the term @xmath4 represents a discontinuous jump such that @xmath5 before the crash and @xmath6 after the crash occurs . the loss amplitude associated with the occurrence of a crash",
    "is determined by the parameter @xmath7 .",
    "each successive crash corresponds to a jump of @xmath8 by one unit .",
    "the dynamics of the jumps is governed by a crash hazard rate @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath10 is the probability that the crash occurs between @xmath11 and @xmath12 conditional on the fact that it has not yet happened , we have @xmath13   = 1 \\times h(t ) dt + 0 \\times ( 1- h(t ) dt)$ ] and therefore @xmath14 = h(t)dt.\\ ] ] under the assumption of the jls model , noise traders exhibit collective herding behaviors that may destabilize the market .",
    "the jls model assumes that the aggregate effect of noise and fundamental traders can be accounted for by the following dynamics of the crash hazard rate @xmath15 if the exponent @xmath16 , the crash hazard may diverge as @xmath11 approaches a critical time @xmath17 , corresponding to the end of the bubble .",
    "the second term in the r.h.s . of ( [ eq : hazard ] ) takes into account the existence of a possible hierarchical cascade of panic acceleration punctuating the course of the bubble , resulting either from a preexisting hierarchy in noise trader sizes @xcite and/or the interplay between market price impact inertia and nonlinear fundamental value investing @xcite .",
    "the no - arbitrage condition reads @xmath18=0 $ ] , which leads to @xmath19 . taking the expectation of ( [ eq : dynamic ] ) with the condition that no crash has yet occurred gives @xmath20 . using the crash hazard rate defined in ( [ eq : hazard ] ) and integrating yields the so - called log - periodic power law ( lppl ) equation for the price : @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "note that this expression ( [ eq : lppl ] ) with ( [ lpplforgen ] ) describes the average price dynamics only up to the end of the bubble .",
    "the jls model does not specify what happens beyond @xmath17 .",
    "this critical @xmath17 is the termination of the bubble regime and the transition time to another regime . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the crash hazard rate accelerates up to @xmath17 but its integral up to @xmath11 , which controls the total probability for a crash to occur up to @xmath11 , remains finite and less than @xmath26 for all times @xmath27 .",
    "it is this property that makes rational for investors to remain invested knowing that a bubble is developing and that a crash is looming @xcite . indeed",
    ", there is still a finite probability that no crash will occur during the lifetime of the bubble , including its end .",
    "the excess return @xmath28 is the remuneration that investors require to remain invested in the bubbly asset , which is exposed to a crash risk .",
    "the condition that the price remains finite at all time , including @xmath17 , requires that @xmath29 .    within the jls framework ,",
    "a bubble is identified when the crash hazard rate accelerates . according to ( [ eq : hazard ] )",
    ", such accelerates occur when @xmath16 and @xmath30 , hence @xmath31 since @xmath32 by the condition that the price remains finite .",
    "we thus have a first condition for a bubble to occur : @xmath33 this condition is the mathematical embodiment of our definition of a financial bubble , characterized by a faster - than - exponential growth as time approaches the critical time @xmath17 .",
    "indeed , it is straightforward to verify that the first - order and higher - order derivatives of the log - price diverge at @xmath17 , in contrast with their finiteness for the standard exponential price model .    by definition , the crash rate should be non - negative .",
    "this imposes @xcite @xmath34      in an effort to study the fundamental price , we modify and generalize the jls model as follows .",
    "we now write the price dynamics of an asset as @xmath35 where the first two items of the right hand side define the standard geometrical brownian motion and the third term is the jump .",
    "when the crash occurs at some time @xmath36 ( implying @xmath37 ) , the price drops abruptly by an amplitude @xmath38 .",
    "the motivations and the interpretation of the three parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 are as follows .    * for @xmath41 , the price drops from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , i.e. , the price changes from its value just before the crash to a fixed well - defined valuation @xmath44 . in the spirit of fama s analysis of the 19 october 1987 crash @xcite , if one interprets the asset price after the crash as the `` right '' price , i.e. , the price discovery towards rational equilibrium without mispricing , the crash is nothing but an efficient assessment by investors of the `` true '' or fundamental value , once the panic has ended .",
    "hence , @xmath44 can be interpreted as the fundamental price which is discovered during the crash dynamics . *",
    "then , @xmath7 can be thought of as a measure of market efficiency , that is , @xmath45 is the relative inaccuracy of the discovery of the fundamental price by the market .",
    "if , say , @xmath46 , this means that the price has dropped by only half of its bubble component , and remains over - valued compared with its fundamental component .",
    "* when different from @xmath26 , the exponent @xmath40 can be interpreted as embodying a nonlinear ( i ) over - reaction for small variations and under - reaction for large deviations ( @xmath47 ) or ( ii ) under - reaction for small variations and over - reaction for large deviations ( @xmath48 ) from the fundamental value .",
    "since @xmath44 is a fixed parameter , the generalized jls model implies that we should measure the price dynamics in the frame moving with the fundamental price . in other words",
    ", @xmath44 is the fundamental price at the beginning @xmath49 of the time period over which the bubble develops . in order to compare in a consistent way the realized price to this fixed parameter , it is necessary to discount the asset price continuously by the rate of return of the fundamental price .",
    "if @xmath50 denotes the empirical price observed at time @xmath11 , this means that the price @xmath51 that enters in expression ( [ eq : dyna2tgmic ] ) is defined by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the annualized growth ( risk free ) rate of the fundamental price . in our empirical analysis",

    "<S> identifying unambiguously the presence of a bubble in an asset price remains an unsolved problem in standard econometric and financial economic approaches . </S>",
