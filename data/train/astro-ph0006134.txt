    "1999 ) , provide strong support for the general theoretical paradigm on which this model was based . such cold dark matter ( cdm )",
    "universes are in excellent agreement with observed large - scale structure , but may be inconsistent with the observed structure of _ nonlinear _ dark matter dominated systems .",
    "navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 , nfw hereafter ) claimed that the density profiles of virialized cdm halos are reasonably approximated by a `` universal '' form with singular behavior near it center .",
    "more recent simulations with higher resolution have confirmed this result , suggesting that the central cusps may be even steeper than the nfw profile ( moore et al .",
    "1999b ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 , see also jing & suto 2000 ) .",
    "such structures appear inconsistent with published data on the rotation curves of dwarf galaxies ( moore 1994 ; flores and primack 1994 ) although this inconsistency may reflect limitations of the data rather than of the theory ( van den bosch et al .",
    "1999 ; van den bosch & swaters 2000 ) .",
    "there may also be a discrepancy between the rich substructure seen in simulations of cdm halos and the relatively small number of satellite galaxies observed in the milky way s halo ( moore et al .",
    "1999a ; klypin et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "spergel & steinhardt ( 2000 ) suggested that a finite cross - section for elastic collisions , such that the mean free path of cdm particles is short in halo cores but long in their outer parts , might alleviate these difficulties .",
    "their proposal has attracted considerable attention .",
    "ostriker ( 2000 ) argued that the massive black holes could grow naturally at the centers of galactic spheroids through the accretion of such dark matter .",
    "miralda - escude ( 2000 ) pointed out that collisional dark matter might produce galaxy clusters which are rounder than observed .",

    "( 2000 ) and yoshida et al .",
    "( 2000 ) simulated cluster evolution in a cosmologically realistic context but in the fluid limit ( very short mean free path ) . in this limit collisonal dark matter produces more cuspy profiles than collisionless cdm , and so gives even poorer fits to published rotation curves for dwarf galaxies .    in this _",
    "letter _ we continue exploring how collisions affect the structure of dark halos .",
    "we simulate the formation of a massive halo in a @xmath0cdm universe assuming scattering cross - sections varying over a wide range .",
    "the inclusion of the infall and merging which occur when halos are embedded in their proper cosmological context leads to core evolution which is considerably more complex than the expansion followed by collapse seen in the simulations of burkert(2000 ) and kochaneck & white(2000 ) .",
    "cross - sections which would significantly modify the core structure of dwarf galaxies produce galaxy cluster cores which are inconsistent with observation .",
    "our simulations use the parallel tree code gadget developed by springel ( 1999 , see also springel , yoshida & white 2000 ) .",
    "we study the same cluster as yoshida et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who resimulated the second most massive object in the @xmath0cdm simulation of kauffmann et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . in order to simulate elastic scattering of cdm particles we adopt the monte carlo method introduced by burkert ( 2000 ) .",
    "we implement this scheme in the following manner . at each time step",
    "we evaluate the scattering probability for particle @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the local density at the particle s position , @xmath5 is the scattering cross - section per unit mass , @xmath6 is the relative velocity between the particle and its nearest neighbour , and @xmath7 is the time step .",
    "this prescription is similar to burkert s , but uses the relative velocity rather than the absolute velocity of particle @xmath2 .",
    "kochaneck & white ( 2000 ) use a similar scheme but estimate the scattering rate more accurately by looping over a certain number of neighbours .",
    "however , the larger smoothing involved in such a procedure can itself introduce difficulties in regions with significant velocity gradients ( meiburg 1986 ) , and so we prefer our simpler scheme which should be unbiased even if somewhat noisier .",
    "we choose timesteps small enough to ensure that a particle travels only a minor fraction of its mean free path within @xmath7 .",
    "we assume each collision to be elastic , of hard - sphere type , and to have a cross - section independent of velocity .",
    "scattering is assumed isotropic in the center - of - mass frame , so that relative velocities are randomly reoriented in each collision .",
    "we carry out simulations for three values of @xmath8 differing by factors of ten .",
    "most of our simulations employ 0.5@xmath9 particles in the high resolution region , with a mass per particle @xmath10 .",
    "the gravitational softening length is set to 20@xmath1kpc , which is @xmath111.4% of the virial radius of the final cluster .",
    "we ran one simulation with 5 times better mass resolution and 7 times better spatial resolution to check for numerical convergence .",
    "all of our resimulations start from the same initial conditions .",
    "the background cosmology is flat with matter density @xmath12 , cosmological constant @xmath13 and expansion rate @xmath14 km@xmath15mpc@xmath15 .",
    "it has a cdm power spectrum normalised so that @xmath16 .",
    "the virial mass of the final cluster is @xmath17 , determined as the mass within the radius @xmath18mpc where the enclosed mean overdensity is 200 times the critical value .",
    "the large - scale matter distribution in all our simulations looks very similar . because we start from identical initial conditions , the particle distributions differ only in regions where collisions are important .",
    "figure 1 shows that the final cluster is more nearly spherical and has a larger core radius for larger collision cross - section .",
    "the quoted axial ratios are determined from the inertia tensors of the matter at densities exceeding 100 times the critical value .",
    "miralda - escude ( 2000 ) argues that the ellipticity of cluster cores , as inferred from gravitational lensing observations , can be used to limit the interaction cross - section . among our final clusters , s1w - b and s1w - c",
    "are severely constrained by the limits he quotes .    in figure 2",
    "we show density profiles for all of our simulations .",
    "also plotted in the bottom panel is the mean collision number per particle .",
    "( we counted collisions for each particle throughout the simulation . )",
    "figure 2 clearly shows the presence of a core whose extent depends on the cross - section . for our intermediate cross - section case ( s1w - b ) , we also carried out a higher resolution simulation .",
    "the two density profiles agree very well ( see figure 2 ) showing that our simulations have converged numerically on scales larger than the gravitational softening length .",
    "the mean collision count at cluster center is 3 for s1w - a , 8 for s1w - b , and 35 for s1w - c .",
    "thus only a few collisions per particle in a hubble time suffice to affect the central density profile , and about 10 collisions per particle result in a core with @xmath19 @xmath20 100@xmath1kpc .",
    "( we define the core radius as the point where the density profile becomes steeper than @xmath21 .",
    "core radii by this definition are given on the right of figure 1 . )",
    "+    unlike an isolated system , our cluster grows through successive mergers .",
    "thus the material in its central region is a mixture of the material from a number of its progenitors .",
    "figure 3 , a time sequence of density profiles for our s1w - c simulation , shows clearly how merger events interrupt the core evolution and produce low density cores .",
    "we let this simulation run beyond the present time to a=1.72 , where @xmath22 is the expansion parameter normalised to its present value .",
    "during the time interval plotted , the cluster experiences major mergers at @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "each of these events is associated with an increase of the core radius .",
    "subsequent relaxation causes the core to shrink again and the central density to rise . for this relatively large cross - section",
    ", relaxation - driven core expansion does not occur within the time interval shown .",
    "in contrast to this complex behavior , the virial mass of the cluster grows quite smoothly , approximately doubling between @xmath25 and @xmath26 . clearly , the core radius of the cluster at @xmath27 results from an interplay between collisional relaxation driven by particle collisions and violent relaxation caused by mergers .",
    "+     +    in figure 4 we compare the amount of substructure within @xmath28 in our various simulations .",
    "we use the subfind algorithm by springel ( 1999 ) to identify subhalos in the final cluster .",
    "this identifies gravitationally self - bound sets of particles that are at higher density than the smooth background of cluster material .",
    "local density is defined at each particle s position in a sph fashion . using this procedure",
    "we find that 3.7% , 3.6% , 2.5% , and 0.7% of the cluster mass is included in subhalos in s1 , s1w - a , s1w - b and s1w - c respectively .",
    "although low mass substructures are somewhat less abundant for larger cross - sections , massive subhalos are _ not _ substantially disrupted in s1w - a and s1w - b .",
    "many of the massive subhalos are @xmath29mpc from the cluster center , where particle collisions are rare in these models ( see the bottom panel of figure 2 ) . hence",
    " dark matter evaporation \" ( spergel & steinhardt 2000 ) is ineffective for them . on the other hand , the massive subhalos in s1w - c are totally disrupted .",
    "infalling halos are rapidly stripped by collisions with `` diffuse '' cluster dark matter in this case .",
    "our simulations of cluster formation in a @xmath0cdm universe made of self - interacting dark matter show that collision rates exceeding one or two per particle per hubble time at cluster center are sufficient to produce a constant density core .",
    "observations of strong lensing by clusters require their cores to be dense and small . thus to fit",
    "the cluster cl0024 + 1654 tyson et al ( 1998 ) needed a core radius of @xmath30  kpc and a central surface density of @xmath31  m@xmath32pc@xmath33 .",
    "recent hst observations of an unbiased sample of x - ray luminous clusters at @xmath34 find thin giant arcs at similar radii ( 10 to 25 arcsec ) in almost all of them ( j .- p .",
    "kneib , private communication ) showing cl0024 + 1654 to be quite typical .",
    "we find core radii of this order in our simulations for a cross - section of 0.1 cm@xmath33/g ( see figure 1 )",
    ".    predicted collision rates in dwarf galaxy cores are much smaller than in clusters for the core radii usually inferred from rotation curve data .",
    "thus for the archetypal example ddo154 , carignan and beaulieu ( 1989 ) give as best fit parameters a core radius @xmath36  kpc and a central surface density @xmath37   m@xmath32pc@xmath33 .",
    "( note the lack of @xmath38 dependence because the distance is measured directly . )",
    "the central collision rate scales as @xmath39 , so collisions are inferred to be 60 times less frequent in ddo154 than in cl0024 + 1654 ( for @xmath40 ) . since particles in the cluster core have no more than a couple of collisions in a hubble time ( see figure 2 ) it is difficult to see how collisions could produce the large apparent core in ddo154 .",
    "this agrees with the recent results of dav et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who concluded from their own simulations that cross - sections of order 5 cm@xmath33/g are needed to produce good agreement with the apparent cores of dwarf galaxies ; they found at best marginal consistency for 0.5 cm@xmath33/g , a value which is still 5 times the upper limit we find to be consistent with cluster data .",
    "a possible solution might seem to be a cross - section about two orders of magnitude larger than in s1w - c .",
    "dwarf galaxy haloes would then look similar to a scaled version of s1w - c , with a core radius of about @xmath41kpc for the parameters considered above , while rich clusters would be highly collisional and might have profiles approaching that in our `` fluid '' simulation .",
    "our earlier work confirmed , however , that such clusters would be almost spherical ; such large cross - sections can thus be excluded following miralda - escude s ( 2000 ) argument .",
    "a different resolution might be to introduce an interaction law which implies an energy dependent cross - section such that scattering is less effective in high velocity encounters .",
    "this would reduce the difference between cluster and dwarf galaxy halos .",
    "this idea requires a more detailed physical model for the dark matter , and we do not pursue it further here .",
    "we note that @xmath42 is required to make the collision rate at @xmath43 approximately independent of halo mass .",
    "another loophole might be for the cores of clusters to contain large amounts of baryonic dark matter , perhaps deposited by cooling flows .",
    "the cooling rates inferred from x - ray data appear too small for this to be viable ( see , e.g. peres et al .",
    ".    in summary our results suggest that collisional dark matter can not produce core radii in dwarf galaxy halos as large as those inferred from rotation curve observations without simultaneously producing cluster cores which are too large and too round to be consistent with gravitational lensing data .",

    "the hospitality of the institute for theoretical physics , ucsb , where this work was initiated , is also acknowledged .",
