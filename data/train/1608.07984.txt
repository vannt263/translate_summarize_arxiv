    "power law distribution may suggest that neural networks operate near a non - equilibrium critical point where the phase transition occurs .",
    "however , power laws are not alone sufficient to establish criticality and also non - critical systems may produce power laws @xcite ; implying that many possible mechanisms generate power law distribution @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", authors argue that the power laws observed in avalanche size distributions are actually artifacts , and in an _ in vivo _",
    "study @xcite , no clear evidence of power - law scaling or self - organized critical states was found in the awake and sleeping brain of mammals in monkey , cat and human .    according to the popular view of per bak @xcite criticality",
    "is realized spontaneously by complex systems rather than requiring the fine tuning of a control parameter with a critical value .",
    "they proposed the term self - organized criticality ( soc ) , as an operation of the system at criticality that generates the power law behavior in natural phenomena .",
    "critical point sets a boundary between an ordered and a less ordered state with different scaling behaviors @xcite .",
    "evidence for criticality in the brain has been found _ in vitro _",
    "experiments @xcite , animals @xcite , and humans @xcite .    in our previous study  @xcite , using leaky integrate - and fire model ( lifm ) , we have shown that _ temporal complexity _ is a robust indicator of criticality with which a critical point is introduced .",
    "we found that temporal complexity uncontaminated by periodicity occurs in a narrow range of values of the control parameter , in correspondence of which the information transfer from one network to another becomes maximal .",
    "we argued that if this enhancement of information transport is interpreted as a signature of criticality , then the power law avalanches are a manifestation of super - criticality rather than criticality .",
    "this led us to conclude that if power - law distribution in avalanches is not found in the brain of mammals , that would not conflict with the hypothesis that the brain works at criticality .",
    "so how temporal complexity is connected to power - laws ? if we consider an event in a system , then the waiting time distribution densities , @xmath2 , have the time - asymptotic form    @xmath3    it was proposed that the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is much more accurate to fit the power - law exponents , as well as to identify if the system obeys a power - law @xcite .",
    "hence the corresponding cumulative distributions , or survival probabilities , is defined as    @xmath4    thus the corresponding cdf also behaves as a power - law , but with a smaller exponent @xmath5 .    in this work ,",
    "we show that by replacing the discrete noise with a continuous gaussian noise in the model , avalanche probability distributions display power law behavior at criticality indicated by temporal complexity and phase transition .",

    "each neuron starts from a random value or zero and fires when it reaches the threshold @xmath18 . when a neuron fires , it forces all the neurons linked to it to make a step ahead or backward by the quantity @xmath10 according to whether @xmath19 ( excitatory ) or @xmath20 ( inhibitory ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath10 plays the all - important role of control parameter and is expected to generate criticality when the special value @xmath21 , to be determined using a suitable criticality indicator , is adopted . after firing , each neuron jumps back to the rest state @xmath22 .",
    "when @xmath23 , the vanishing noise condition yields the following expression for the time distance between two consecutive firings of the same neuron @xmath24 if @xmath25 , after a few time steps all the neurons fire at the same time @xcite , thereby generating a sequence of quakes of intensity @xmath13 with the time period @xmath26 given by equation .",
