    "the concept of brownian motion,@xcite or more specifically , langevin equation,@xcite was originally developed under the premise that the system of interest follows fully deterministic paths if left alone and that environmental effects can be accounted for by random forces and frictional drags satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation relationship . how to extend such description to the quantum mechanical regime governing time evolution of quantum operators had remained difficult in practice@xcite or was even considered impossible,@xcite although some advances have been made.@xcite on the other hand , the fokker - planck equation ( fpe),@xcite which considers time evolution of distribution function instead , is more amenable to quantum generalization because the distribution can be obtained naturally from a quantum density operator retaining complete information on the quantum system .",
    "indeed , a few well defined and tractable derivations of quantum fpe ( qfpe)@xcite or hierarchical qfpes@xcite are available now .",
    "one of the most well - known derivation of qfpe was provided by caldeira and leggett ( cl)@xcite based on the feynman - vernon influence functional formalism.@xcite this approach has also been extended to the case of nonadiabatic quantum dynamics by garg , onuchic , and ambegaokar ( goa).@xcite cl s derivation of qfpe invokes high temperature and the markovian approximation for the bath dynamics . although not explicit , an assumption of weak system - bath coupling appears to be implicit in the derivation as well .",
    "indeed , a distinct quantum smoluchowski equation ( qse)@xcite is obtained following a similar approach but taking the effect of strong system - bath coupling properly .",
    "however , this qse still assumes that the bath relaxes much faster than the system , and does not account for the non - markovian effect that can have potentially important effects .",
    "major applications of qfpe include quantum extension@xcite of kramers barrier crossing problem and proton or electron transfer dynamics.@xcite in particular , for the latter case , there has been growing interest in the study of fast photo - induced reaction dynamics that can occur during time scales comparable to those of molecular relaxation and dephasing dynamics.@xcite for these , currently available qfpe or qse are not well suited .",
    "thus , generalization of qfpe to include non - markovian and nonequilibrium effects remains an important and interesting theoretical issue to be addressed .",
    "although more general hierarchical equations@xcite may be used to this end , the benefit of having a single closed form equation , which can account for such non - markovian and nonequilibrium effects , can not be overestated .",
    "in addition , the fact that cl s qfpe@xcite is not positive definite remains a lingering theoretical issue .",
    "although it is true that positive definiteness is not necessary for accurate description of the open system quantum dynamics,@xcite it is still important to understand the source of its violation and how to fix the problem .",
    "disi showed that the non - positivity can result from an inconsistent application of the markovian approximation@xcite and that it can partially be corrected by including next order terms in the intermediate temperature regime .",
    "the present work shows that a a similar consideration can be made in deriving a generalized qfpe ( gqfpe ) and that the resulting equation is of the dekker form,@xcite which has a well - defined condition for positive definiteness .",
    "a detailed consideration of this equation for ohmic spectral density with drude cutoff shows that the lindblad s positive definiteness condition@xcite can indeed be satisfied in the steady state limit under reasonable physical condition .",
