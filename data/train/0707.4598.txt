    "type - ia supernovae ( sne - ia ) play a central role in astrophysics , not only as distance indicators for cosmography , but also as major contributors to cosmic metal production and distribution .",
    "the occurrence of some sn - ia explosions in early - type galaxies , having no trace of a young stellar population , implies that at least some of these events are derived from old stars , likely low - mass stars or white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "detailed analysis of the optical spectra and light curves of sne - ia ( e.g. , mazzali et al .",
    "2007 ) , and of some nearby sn remnants thought to have been sne - ia ( e.g. , badenes et al .",
    "2006 ) , are consistent with a scenario in which a c+o wd approaches or passes the chandrasekhar mass limit , @xmath4 , initiating carbon ignition under degenerate conditions .",
    "this leads to thermonuclear runaway and incineration of much of the wd into iron - peak elements , among which the radioactive ones power the optical light curve ( see , e.g. , hillebrandt & niemeyer 2000 , for a review )",
    ".    however , the nature of the process behind the growth toward the chandrasekhar mass is not known .",
    "the two leading competing scenarios are accretion from a close binary companion ",
    "the single - degenerate ( sd ) scenario ( whelan & iben 1973 ; nomoto 1982 ) or merger with another wd , following loss of orbital energy and angular momentum by emission of gravitational waves  the double - degenerate ( dd ) scenario ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) .",
    "both scenarios envision passage of the binary through at least one common - envelope phase .",
    "the complex physics of this stage are a major obstacle in calculations of the binary evolution of sn - ia progenitors . in the sd case , it is also unknown what is the nature of the companion  a main sequence , giant , or sub - giant star , and what is the form of the accretion flow ",
    "roche lobe overflow or a wind .",
    "once conditions for runaway have been reached ( and these could be sub - chandra , chandra , or super - chandra ) , there are various possibilities for where in the wd ignition occurs , and how the burning front propagates  various combinations of subsonic ( `` deflagration '' ) and supersonic ( `` detonation '' ) propagation have been considered .",
    "a number of authors have computed , for the various possible progenitor scenarios , the `` delay time distributions '' for the time between the formation of a stellar population and the explosion of some of its members as sne - ia ( e.g. , greggio & renzini 1983 ; jorgensen et al .",
    "1997 ; sadat et al . 1998 ; madau et al . 1998 ; ruiz - lapuente & canal 1998 ; yungelson & livio 2000 ; matteucci & recchi 2001 ; han & podsiadlowski 2004 ; greggio 2005 ; belczynski et al . 2005 ) .",
    "the actual co - existence of several different channels that lead to sne - ia is possible .",
    "in fact , evidence has surfaced recently for two different types of sne - ia , in young and in old stellar populations ( see  [ localratio ] , below ) .",
    "a better , observationally guided , understanding of what objects explode in sne - ia , and how it happens , is clearly desirable for the confident use of these objects as standard candles , and for a coherent picture of metal enrichment . in this paper ,",
    "i revisit the exploding fraction , a simple parameter that can be derived from observations , and which can place constraints on the sn - ia progenitor population .",
    "any measurement implying a total sn - ia number from some stellar population , relative to some parameter that permits normalizing the initial mass function ( imf ) of that population , combined with an assumption about the functional form of the imf , can give a direct estimate of the fraction @xmath0 of stars with initial masses in the range @xmath5 that eventually explode as sne - ia .",
    "i compile here five types of such measurements , and the explosion fractions that they imply , which are also summarised in table  1 .    in the dd scenario , a minimum zero - age main - sequence ( zams ) mass above @xmath6",
    "is probably required for each of the members of a sn - ia progenitor binary system if , after the mass loss involved in post - main - sequence and binary evolution , a total wd mass of at least @xmath4 is to be attained ( e.g. , branch et al .",
    "1995 ; weidemann 2000 ; tutukov & yungelson 2002 ) . the maximum initial mass of the primary in the binary , @xmath7 , equals the minimum initial mass for eventual core - collapse , generally thought to be in the range @xmath8 ( timmes et al .",
    "it is possible that binaries with one or both masses somewhat outside the @xmath9 range can also produce sn - ia explosions .",
    "for example , in the model calculations by tutukov & yungelson ( 2002 ) , the wds descended from binaries with primaries of zams mass @xmath10 and secondaries of zams mass of only @xmath11 can still sometimes merge and surpass the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "tutukov & yungelson ( 2002 ) also assume a relatively high minimum mass for core collapse , @xmath12 , and therefore quite massive primaries also contribute to their calculated sn - ia rate .",
    "the observationally identified progenitors of several core - collapse sne have best - fit masses of @xmath8 , but the model uncertainties permit masses as high as @xmath13 ( maund & smartt 2005 ; li et al .",
    "2006 ; hendry et al .",
    "nevertheless , among all the dd mergers with total mass @xmath14 in the tutukov & yungelson ( 2002 ) simulations , 85% originate from binaries in which both members had zams masses between @xmath15 ( l. yungelson , private communication ) , and therefore this is a useful range to consider for the progenitors of the large majority of sne - ia .",
    "i will henceforth use the following notations .",

    "the imf , @xmath17 , is given in terms of stars per unit mass interval .",

    "the upper mass limit is 50 , since more massive stars may collapse directly to black holes without a sn explosion . lowering the upper limit to 25 reduces @xmath0 by 14% , and raising it to 100 increases it by 9%",

    "the luminosity and colors of a stellar population at a given time is dominated by the most massive stars that are evolving off the main sequence at that time , while the mass of the population is dominated by the least massive , but most numerous , stars , the derivation of a star formation rate therefore requires the assumption of an imf for the largely unobserved low - mass population . for self - consistency , the right side of eq .",

    "first , we can consider the possibility that the various observational estimates of sn - ia rates have systematically erred on the high side .",

    "in fact , such contamination may be behind some of the discrepant sn - ia rates measured at @xmath213 by several groups ( see discussion in poznanski et al .",

    "however , i have shown that even the lower estimates of @xmath0 are still high , compared with the theoretical expectations , and furthermore there is consistency with intermediate values of @xmath3 from a variety of independent methods ( not all of them involving sn rates ) .",
    "sn rates can also be overestimated if the sensitivity times of the surveys are underestimated , i.e. , the surveys are more sensitive to faint sne than they assume , which is quite unlikely to always be the case .",
    "a flat distribution in the binary mass - ratio , @xmath149 , was assumed for close binaries in the tutukov & yungelson ( 2002 ) simulations , while in the observational analysis i considered distributions that are either flat or mildly rising toward low @xmath158 .",
    "an inverted mass ratio distribution that favors large ( @xmath214 ) values of @xmath158 would raise @xmath167 , and thus lower the `` observed '' @xmath186 ( in an extreme version , @xmath149 would be a @xmath47 function at @xmath215 , i.e. , all close binaries are `` twins '' ) . in the simulations ,",
    "such `` twinness '' would increase the rate of occurrence of super - chandra mergers ( although such equal - mass mergers would also be more prone to dynamical instability leading to core collapse , rather than a sn - ia ; nomoto & iben 1985 ) .",

    "however , their twins all have primaries in the @xmath216 mass range , so even if this is not a selection effect , the relevance to the present study is not certain .",
    "a similar type of solution is to assume that there are more close binaries than indicated by modern studies , and this would again work toward making the observational and theoretical estimates of @xmath186 more consistent with each other . again",

    "an alternate approach to solve the problem may be to hypothesize a quite different form for the imf .",

    "nayakshin & sunyaev ( 2005 ) have used the low level of x - ray emission to deduce a factor-10 deficiency in the number of @xmath238 stars , compared to the orion nebula cluster , and to expectations from a standard imf . near - infrared observations by maness et al .",
    "( 2007 ) lead to similar conclusions .",
    "however , this case of top - heavy star formation is thought to be a peculiarity related to the proximity of the sag a * cluster to the galaxy s supermassive black hole .",
    "thus , it appears that direct and persistent evidence for a non - standard imf is scarce , and this is unlikely to be the solution the sn - ia formation efficiency problem .      turning to the theoretical calculations ,",
    "as noted above , tout ( 2005 ) has made the point that values of @xmath195 sufficiently larger than unity can improve dramatically the efficiency of both the sd and dd channels . in his simulations , raising @xmath195 from 1 to 3 increases the sn - ia rate by an order of magnitude , in some cases .",
    "if such an assumption is valid , this could be a solution to the problem .    finally , we may consider the more radical possibility that some of the more basic assumptions about sn - ia progenitors are wrong .",
    "both the dd and sd scenarios are not free of theoretical and observational problems .",
    "it has long been argued that the final stage of a dd merger will lead to an accretion - induced core collapse , rather than a sn - ia ( e.g. , nomoto & iben 1985 ; saio & nomoto 2004 , guerrero et al .",
    "2004 ) , although there are opposing views that invoke rotation of the stellar surface to prevent this outcome ( e.g. , piersanti et al .",
    "2003 ) . an observational search for dd progenitor systems ( napiwotzki et al . 2004 ; nelemans et al . 2005 ) has turned up , among @xmath239 wds surveyed , few or no potential dd systems with a total mass exceeding @xmath4 that will merge within a hubble time .",
    "it is not yet clear if this low detection rate is significantly smaller than expected if the dd scenario is to explain the galactic sn - ia rate ( which is , itself , quite uncertain ) .",
    "for example , if the galactic rate is @xmath240 , there should be @xmath241 progenitor systems that will merge within @xmath242  yr .",
    "if there are @xmath243 stars in the galaxy , then , assuming a kroupa ( 2001 ) imf , of order 10% , or @xmath242 , will be wds . only one in a thousand wds surveyed would therefore be expected to be a sn - ia progenitor , which is consistent , at this order - of - magnitude level , with the current survey .",
    "a more detailed calculation , taking into account galactic structure and star formation history , survey completeness , and selection effects , is required in order to determine whether or not the observations are in conflict with the dd scenario .",
    "the sd scenario , in turn , has been criticized for its assumptions about the existence of _ ad hoc _ mechanisms that regulate the accretion flow on to the primary ( e.g. , cassisi et al . 1998 ; piersanti et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "observationally , badenes et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have noted the absence , in seven nearby sn - ia remnants , of the signatures of the strong wind from the accretor that supposedly stabilises the accretion flow , and permits reaching @xmath4 in the hachisu et al .",
    "( 1996 ) model .",
    "prieto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have pointed out that a subtantial number of sne - ia have been discovered , by now , in low - metallicity galaxies , in contrast to to the prediction by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 1998 ) that sne - ia can not explode in such environments , due to a minimum metallicity that is required for the wind regulation mechanism to be effective .",
    "( yoon et al .",
    "2004 have proposed wd rotation as an alternative or additional mechanism for stabilising high accretion rates . ) while evidence for circumstellar material , consistent with expectations from a wind from a red - giant companion , has been found in one recent normal sn - ia ( patat et al .",
    "2007 ) , such material is not observed in another event ( simon et al .",
    "2007 ) . for the remnant of tycho s sn , which was a type - ia ( badenes et al . 2006 ) ,",
    "there have been conflicting claims about the identification and nature of a remaining companion star ( ruiz - lapuente et al .",
    "2004 ; fuhrmann 2005 ; ihara et al . 2007 ) .",
    "if , in the end , no companion is found , this would be another problem for the sd picture .",
    "a speculative direction that may be worth considering is that , perhaps , sne - ia are not descended from binary systems .",
    "iben & renzini ( 1983 ) have reviewed several stellar evolution studies of intermediate - mass stars , in which mass loss has not reduced the remaining stellar mass below @xmath244 at the time of carbon ignition in the core . such single stars may undergo a thermonuclear runaway that disrupts the star , but iben & renzini ( 1983 ) concluded that , due to the many assumptions and approximations , `` one is not left with an overwhelming sense of confidence in the detailed results '' . such an explosion would be expected to take place still within a hydrogen - rich envelope , and hence would not resemble a normal sn - ia . however , tout ( 2005 ) has sketched the possibility that some not - fully understood aspect of stellar evolution leads all stars in some initial mass range to avoid mass loss on the red giant branch , but to then completely lose their hydrogen envelopes on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) , proceeding then to a chandra - mass thermonuclear runaway of their cores in such a `` single - star '' sn - ia channel . in a variant of this idea , waldman , yungelson , & barkat ( 2007 ) have postulated that interaction with a binary companion is responsible for the stripping of the envelope , but the stripped star then goes on to explode as a single star .",
    "observationally , recent metal abundance measurements in kepler s sn remnant strongly suggest a type - ia explosion ( e.g. , blair et al . 2007 ; reynolds et al . 2007 )",
    ". however , the @xmath245  km  s@xmath78 velocity of the remnant as a whole away from the galactic plane , together with evidence for a circumstellar medium from a massive progenitor , are difficult to understand in the context of a binary progenitor system ( reynolds et al .",
    "aubourg et al .",
    "( 2007 ) have modeled the stellar populations of sn - ia host galaxies , and concluded that the prompt sn - ia component explodes within 70  myr of star formation , implying a primary initial mass range of @xmath246 .",
    "for such a narrow and high range , all of the estimates of @xmath0 through the prompt channel will become even higher than found earlier .",
    "for example , @xmath247 will be @xmath248 .",
    "even with the most conservative binary parameters ( including a substantial `` twin '' population , which could raise @xmath167 , but at the same time would restore the duplicity factor , @xmath180 ) , it is then difficult to avoid an excess of sne - ia compared to progenitor binary systems . a single - star channel would solve this problem .    a good place to test for the existence of such single - star progenitors could be the lmc .",
    "taking a value of @xmath249 for the sn - ia rate per star formation rate ( see  2.2 ) , which should be appropriate for star - forming dwarf galaxies like the lmc , and a @xmath250 value of @xmath251 ( kennicutt et al .",
    "1995 ) , an lmc sn - ia rate of @xmath252 is obtained .",
    "another estimate can be made if the 2:1 to 4:1 ratio ( mannucci et al . 2005 ) of core - collapse to sn - ia rates in star - forming galaxies holds for the lmc , then amongst the 45 to 76 sn remnants in the lmc ( sasaki , haberl , & pietsch 2000 ; bojicic et al .",
    "2007 ) , roughly @xmath253 should be the remnants of sne - ia .",
    "divided by a typical @xmath254  yr lifetime of a remnant , this gives a sn - ia rate of @xmath255 .",
    "the agb stage of zams @xmath139 stars lasts of order @xmath256  yr ( e.g. , girardi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "thus , if sn - ia progenitors are agb stars that have lost their hydrogen envelopes , there could be a few tens or hundreds of such stars in the lmc .",
    "calculated colors and spectra of such objects could be compared to observations by searching for candidate progenitors in photometric catalogues of luminous stars in the lmc ( cioni et al .",
    "2000 ; nikolaev & weinberg 2000 ) .    to summarize ,",
    "i have collected measurements pertinent to five independent methods for estimating the fraction of potential sn - ia progenitors that explode as sne - ia .",
    "i have compared them self - consistently , and studied the dependence of the fraction on the assumed imf and on other parameters .",
    "modern measurements of sn rates and related observables leave little doubt that a large fraction of the intermediate - mass stellar population explodes as sne - ia , larger than would be expected based on most sd and dd models",
    ". a critical reappraisal of our ideas about sn - ia progenitors may be in order .",
    "i thank lev yungelson for providing some unpublished statistics from his simulations , and carles badenes , wolfgang hillebrandt , mordecai mac low , tsevi mazeh , paolo mazzali , jacco vink , and dennis zaritsky for comments and advice .",

    "<S> type - ia supernova ( sn - ia ) explosions are thought to result from a thermonuclear runaway in carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( wds ) that approach the chandrasekhar limit , either through accretion from a companion or a merger with another wd . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is unknown which of these channels operates in reality , and what are the details of the process . </S>",
    "<S> i compile from the literature observational estimates of the fraction @xmath0 of intermediate - mass stars that eventually explode as sne - ia , supplement them with several new estimates , and compare them self - consistently . </S>",
    "<S> the estimates are based on five different methods , each utilising some observable related to the sn - ia rate , combined with assumptions regarding the initial mass function ( imf ) : the ratio of sn - ia to core - collapse explosions in star - forming galaxies ; the sn - ia rate per unit star - formation rate ; the sn - ia rate per unit stellar mass ; the iron to stellar mass ratio in galaxy clusters ; and the abundance ratios in galaxy clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the five methods indicate that a fraction in the range @xmath1 of all stars with initial masses of @xmath2 ( the progenitors of the wds generally thought capable of exploding through the above scenarios ) explode as sne - ia . </S>",
    "<S> a fraction of @xmath3 is consistent with all five methods for a range of plausible imfs . </S>",
    "<S> considering also the binarity fraction among such stars , the fraction of binaries with the appropriate mass ratios , the fraction in close initial orbits , and duplicity ( every binary can produce only one sn - ia explosion ) , this implies that nearly every intermediate - mass close binary ends up as a sn - ia , or possibly more sne - ia than progenitor systems . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically expected fractions are generally one to two orders of magnitude lower . the problem could be solved : if all the observational estimates are in error ; or with a `` middle - heavy '' imf ; or by some mechanism that strongly enhances the efficiency of binary evolution toward sn - ia explosion ; or by a non - binary origin for sne - ia .    </S>",
