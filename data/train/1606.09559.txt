    "taxis is the biased movement of bacteria , somatic cells , or multicellular organisms in response to external stimuli such as light , electric currents , gravity and chemicals .",
    "taxes are classified based on the type of activating stimulus and on whether the organism s resultant drift is oriented towards ( positive ) or away from ( negative ) the stimulus source @xcite .",
    "tactic cell migration plays a crucial role in biological pattern formation and the organization of complex biological organisms . for instance , bacteria find food ( e.g. , glucose ) or flee from poison ( e.g. , phenol ) by swimming respectively up ( positive chemotaxis ) or down ( negative chemotaxis ) the concentration gradient of the sensed chemical @xcite .",
    "a biomimetic counterpart of cellular motility is the ability of specially designed synthetic microparticles to propel themselves by harvesting kinetic energy from an active environment @xcite .",
    "self - propulsion is fueled by stationary non - equilibrium processes , like directional  power - strokes \" from catalytic chemical reactions or self - phoresis by short - scale ( electric , thermal , or chemical ) gradients , produced by the particle itself , in virtue of some built - in functional asymmetry @xcite .",
    "similarly to bacteria , artificial microswimmers are also known to diffuse up or down long - scale monotonic gradients of the active medium @xcite .",
    "however , bacteria regulate their response to an external stimulus by adapting their ( complex ) tactic signal transduction pathways @xcite , which thus operate like sensor - actuator loops . in contrast , due to their often sub - micron size and lack of an internal structure , synthetic swimmers are unable to process the tactic signal @xcite , i.e. their response being strictly local .        in most circumstances",
    "the tactic stimulus is modulated in space and time in the form of single or entrained active pulses that sweep through the suspended swimmer .",
    "certain microorganisms are able to locate the source of the pulses and move towards it , no matter what the sign of their response to a monotonic active gradient .",
    "a study case is the chemotactic aggregation of the amoebae of the cellular slime mold ( dictyostelium discoideum ) @xcite .",
    "this process is directed by periodic sequences ( or waves ) of _ symmetric _ concentration pulses of a chemoattractant , irradiating from the aggregation center outwards . as amoebae exhibit positive chemotaxis",
    ", one would expect a cell movement towards the center in the wave - front and away from it in the wave - back . as a consequence",
    ", amoebae would spend more time in the back - wave than in the front - wave , thus undergoing a net drift in the direction of the active wave propagation .",
    "most remarkably , the conclusion of this argument ( first proposed by stokes in a more general fluidodynamics context @xcite ) does not change by reversing the sign of amoeba chemotaxis : according to stokes wave fore - rear asymmetry argument and contrary to experimental observations , swimmers with definite chemotaxis ( positive or negative , alike ) would always surf active density waves ( adw ) , thus moving away from the the wave source @xcite .",
    "a proposed resolution of this apparent paradox ( termed  chemotactic wave paradox \" in ref .",
    "@xcite ) for cellular microorganisms requires the standard model for cell chemotaxis to be modified so as to account for a _",
    "finite _ adaptation time of the chemotactic pathways to temporally varying stimuli @xcite .",
    "this approach can not be extended to the case of artificial swimmers diffusing across a traveling adw because these respond to the instantaneous activation properties of the surrounding medium with no temporal memory @xcite . however , controlling the transport of synthetic sub - micron particles , self - propelling in a spatio - temporally modulated active medium , is key to the success of nanorobotics in technological applications , like environmental monitoring , intelligent drug delivery , or even more challenging biomedical tasks @xcite . with this goal in mind",
    ", we numerically investigated the diffusive dynamics of artificial microswimmers at low reynolds numbers , subjected to traveling symmetric active pulses of different waveforms .",
    "we observed that swimmers with positive taxis in a monotonic active gradient , actually drift towards or away from the pulse source , depending on the pulse sequence .",
    "moreover , chiral swimmers , which due to some configurational asymmetry tend to move in circles @xcite , may also drift orthogonally to the incoming active wave .",
    "the variability of swimmers tactic response is proven to result more from the spatio - temporal modulation of their active motion within a traveling pulse , than the pulse fore - rear gradient asymmetry .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ results ] we introduce the model of the artificial microswimmer that is to be considered .",
    "already in this section , without resorting to the finer technical details ( given later ) , a qualitative presentation of the key results will be given . here",
    "the tactic responses of the swimmer to single wave pulses and also to active density waves are discussed . a more quantitative discussion of these results is given in sec",
    ".  [ discussion ] , where , in addition , related analytical results will be presented . finally , in sec .",
    "[ methods ] , the details of the methods used to obtain the results will be explained , including the numerical schemes applied to integrate the langevin and corresponding fokker - planck equations .",
    "regardless of the details of the self - propulsion mechanism , at low reynolds numbers the diffusion of an artificial microswimmer on a surface is conveniently modeled by a set of simple langevin equations ( le ) @xmath0 three sources of fluctuations are explicitly incorporated in the model : two translational of intensity @xmath1 , and one orientational of intensity @xmath2 .",
    "all noises are gaussian and stationary , with zero - mean and autocorrelation functions @xmath3 , with @xmath4 .",
    "as such noises result from a combination of thermal fluctuations in the suspension fluid and randomness of the propulsion mechanism , we treat the intensities @xmath1 and @xmath2 as independent parameters . finally , depending on their geometry , 2d swimmers often experience an additional torque , @xmath5 , which makes them rotate counter - clockwise or clockwise .",
    "positive and negative chiral effects impact the transport properties of both biological and synthetic active swimmers @xcite .",
    "when the swimmer floats in a homogeneous active suspension , its propulsion speed is a constant , @xmath6 . as detailed in sec .",

    "this amounts to inserting in eqs .",
    "( [ le1 ] ) an appropriate function @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the pulse s speed and the waveform @xmath15 is chosen so as to describe single or entrained traveling pulses @xcite with amplitude @xmath16 . like in ref .",
    "@xcite , here we restrict our analysis to spatially symmetric waveforms , @xmath17 , in order to avoid additional ratchet effects @xcite . the exact mechanism underlying the tactic stimulus modeled by the spatio - temporal function @xmath11",
    "does not , in principle , need to be specified ; it can , for instance , be of    electro- or thermophoretic nature .    a proof of concept of the tactic effects predicted in this work is sketched in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) . in this ideal experiment a thermophoretic swimmer , floating on a planar substrate , is irradiated by a defocused laser beam @xcite .",
    "a traveling train of laser intensity pulses is created by inserting a slit screen between the light source and the substrate and sliding it at a constant speed .",
    "since the self - propulsive speed of a thermophoretic swimmer is approximately proportional to the laser intensity @xcite , one can thus tailor at will the spatio - temporal modulation of the velocity field , @xmath11 .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , in the following we adopt the term positive or negative chemotaxis to mean the drift of an active swimmer parallel or anti - parallel to the direction of a generic incoming active pulse or wave , regardless of its nature .",
    "moreover , we remind the reader that , like in the experimental setup of fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) , the propulsion speed of most artificial chemotactic swimmers grows linearly with the concentration of the chemoactivants in the active suspension , whereas , as assumed in eqs .",
    "( [ le1 ] ) , their angular diffusion stays almost the same @xcite .",
    "such swimmers , when placed in a static velocity field , that is for @xmath18 , are known to diffuse up the velocity gradient @xcite .",
    "other authors @xcite have detected the dependence of the rotational diffusion on the active density wave to be generally weaker than of the propulsion speed . extending our analysis to an @xmath12-dependent @xmath2 would not alter the general conclusions of the present work , except for some more laborious technical details @xcite .",
    "finally , we stress that in the ideal experiment of fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) hydrodynamic effects can be largely suppressed , at least in the absence of activant gradients .",
    "indeed @xcite , ( i ) swimmers freely diffuse in the bulk away from the container s walls ; ( ii ) their density can be lowered so as to avoid clustering @xcite    ; and ( iii ) they can be fabricated rounded in shape and so small in size ( i.e. , pointlike ) to minimize hydrodynamic backflow effects . on the contrary , the activant gradients considered in the present work surely cause additional hydrodynamic effects in the form of a polarizing torque that tends to align the particle s velocity parallel or anti - parallel to the gradient , depending on the swimmer s surface properties @xcite .",
    "our simulations show that chemotaxis is enhanced for swimmers aligned against the activant gradient and suppressed in the opposite case , as also reported in ref .",
    "however , we numerically checked that the chemotactic effect persists even in the latter case , solely its magnitude slightly diminishes . to keep our discussion as simple as possible ,",
    "polarization effects will be neglected here and fully investigated in a follow - up technical report .",
    "we now qualitatively discuss the numerical results of figs .",
    "[ f2]-[f4 ] , that were obtained by numerically integrating the les ( [ le1 ] ) and the corresponding fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) ( see sec .  [ methods ] ) .",
    "a more technical analysis of these results will be presented in sec .",
    "[ discussion ] .      in figs .",
    "[ f2](b)-(d ) and supplementary movies 1 and 2 @xcite we illustrate the effects of an active gaussian pulse of amplitude @xmath16 traveling from left to right across a swimmer at rest in the absence of translational fluctuations , @xmath19 . the swimmer undergoes a net longitudinal shift , @xmath20 : most notably , @xmath21 is markedly negative for slow pulses , @xmath22 , and positive for fast pulses , @xmath23 , see figs .",
    "[ f2](c),(d ) .",
    "we explain the existence of opposite chemotactic regimes by noticing that a swimmer with @xmath19 diffuses only across the width of the incoming active pulse .",
    "suspended inside a slow travelling pulse with @xmath24 , the particle quickly diffuses either against the front or the rear of the pulse . upon reaching either pulse s edge ,",
    "its diffusivity gets suppressed , that is its self - propulsive velocity , @xmath15 , grows smaller than the pulse speed , @xmath14 .",
    "the ensuing behaviour at the two sides of the pulse is different .",
    "after hitting the r.h.s . , the particle is caught up again by the advancing pulse and resumes diffusing , whereas upon hitting the l.h.s . , it is left behind and comes to rest .",
    "the two pulse s edges behave , respectively , like travelling reflecting and adsorbing walls . as a result",
    "we expect , on average , a net shift of the particle to the left . in the opposite regime of a fast travelling pulse , @xmath25 ,",
    "the particle comes almost immediately to rest when hitting the left pulse wall , while it can travel a much longer distance to the right without bouncing against the right pulse wall . in the optimal case ,",
    "@xmath26 , such a distance is of the order of the persistence length , @xmath27 .",
    "accordingly , for a fixed pulse width , @xmath21 attains a positive maximum around @xmath28 , and vanishes monotonically in the limit @xmath29 .",
    "consistent with our interpretation , in figs .",
    "[ f2](c)-(d ) the transition from negative to positive chemotaxis occurs when the time the particle takes to diffuse a length of the order of @xmath27 , grows longer than the corresponding pulse crossing time , namely for @xmath30 . of course , under realistic experimental conditions , the apparent divergence of the shift , @xmath31 , at vanishingly slow pulse speeds , fig .",
    "[ f2](c ) , would be offset by the inevitable translational fluctuations with @xmath32 , neglected in the simulations of fig .",
    "moreover , for narrow pulses , @xmath33 , the swimmer can not diffuse much inside the pulse , but crosses it _ ballistically_. consequently , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f2](d ) , its positive drift is more pronounced than in the case @xmath34 .",
    "vice versa , for large pulse widths the particle s dynamics is dominated by active diffusion and its displacement grows increasingly negative at small @xmath14 .",
    "of course , for @xmath35 the activant gradient becomes negligible and @xmath21 vanishes .",
    "thus , in the regime of negative @xmath21 , for any chosen @xmath14 there exists an optimal pulse width where the negative particle displacement is ma ! ximum .",
    "more generally , active pulses are generated in random or periodic sequences .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we consider here the case of periodic adws with waveform @xmath36 like in most experimental setups , we assume that the parameters that regulate the swimmer s dynamics , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath27 , are fixed , whereas the adw parameters , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , can be tuned at the experimenter s convenience .",
    "we checked that the swimmer s chemotactic response is not appreciably modified by varying the sequence or waveform of the active pulses .",
    "in the stationary regime , chemotaxis of achiral swimmers with @xmath41 is characterized in terms of the drift velocity , @xmath42 .",
    "this is plotted in fig .",
    "[ f3 ] for different values of the wave parameters .",

    "negative chemotaxis is induced by slow adws only , with @xmath45 ( supplementary movies 3 - 6 @xcite ) . indeed , for fast adws",
    ", the distance a swimmer can travel without crossing a minimum of @xmath15 is longer to the right than to the left .",
    "hence , one can expect that @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , the distance the swimmer can surf a wave with @xmath26 is limited solely by its persistence time , @xmath38 , so that here positive chemotaxis is the most pronounced .",
    "vice versa , for @xmath47 , the swimmer crosses the adw troughs , with reduced self - propulsion speed , both left and right . as the adw propagates to the right",
    ", the time the swimmer takes to cross a trough to its left is shorter than to its right , hence @xmath48 ( supplementary movies 3 and 4 @xcite ) .",
    "this argument certainly holds for @xmath19 , where  provided @xmath49the particle can never cross a trough to the right , see fig .  [",
    "f3](b ) and supplementary movies 4 and 6 @xcite .    the translational fluctuations , @xmath32 , help the swimmer diffuse across the adw troughs , suppressing the velocity rectification mechanism described above .",
    "thus , with increasing @xmath1 , the negative rectification effect becomes smaller compared to the positive surfing effect , until eventually @xmath50 changes sign .",
    "as the same effect can not only be achieved by raising the noise strength @xmath1 , but also by lowering the pulse periodicity @xmath51 ( translational noise can easily `` kick '' particles out a narrow pulse ) , the separatrix bends downward , almost vertically , at a critical value of @xmath51  see fig.[f3](a ) .",
    "the positive chemotaxis observed in the bottom - left quadrant of fig .",

    "[ f5](c ) clearly shows that @xmath54 grows linearly with @xmath44 , independently of @xmath27 .",
    "this implies that the vertical branch of the separatrix can be shifted to lower @xmath51 either by lowering @xmath1 or increasing @xmath44 .",

    "we conclude that negative chemotaxis is a robust property of the system , since it sets in under the most affordable experimental conditions of adws traveling with low speed , @xmath47 , and long wavelength , @xmath59 .      an intrinsic rotational torque of the swimmer can be either the accidental result of fabrication defects or the desired effect obtained , e.g. , by bending an active nanorod @xcite . in any case",
