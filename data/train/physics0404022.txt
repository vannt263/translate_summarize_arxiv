    "x - waves , originally introduced by lu and greenleaf in acoustics,@xcite can be simply described as a non - monochromatic superposition of plane - waves with the same wavevector component along a given direction of propagation .",
    "the resulting pulsed beam can travel undistorted without neither diffraction or dispersion , even in the absence of a nonlinear self - action .",
    "such x packets have been the subject of intense research in several fields , as recently reviewed in @xcite .",
    "the first experimental evidence of x - wave formation during nonlinear optical processes was reported in @xcite .",
    "subsequently , x - related results have appeared in @xcite , including a theoretical analysis and discussion on the generation and existence of this class of spatially and temporally localized waves in nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned experimental and theoretical results have stimulated further investigations on the role of x - waves in nonlinear processes , as well as their description in terms of linear waves with a convenient envelope approach , @xcite and their extension to quantized fields .",
    "@xcite within the active field of optical self - invariant pulsed beams ( see among others @xcite ) , it was recognized that x - waves may play a fundamental role in all the nonlinear processes encompassing spatio - temporal mechanics , well beyond the realm of quadratic frequency mixing where they had been originally observed .",
    "x - waves have been also predicted in periodic media and bose condensed gases .",
    "@xcite    x- or _ progressive undistorted waves _ in focusing or defocusing kerr media can be associated to the instability of wide beams propagating in the presence of a refractive index linearly dependent on intensity .",
    "@xcite this effect has also been investigated in quadratically nonlinear media @xcite .",
    "very recently light filamentation with femtoseconds pulses in water , @xcite was explained by the `` nonlinear x - wave paradigm '' .",
    "@xcite the authors pointed out that these spatio - temporal packets can be highly dynamic , i.e. they are continuously generated , undergoing splitting and replenishment with an `` average '' invariant propagation .",
    "such a picture points out the robustness of x - waves with respect to the numerous non - trivial effects that may take place in 3 + 1d nonlinear processes . on the contrary , self - trapped light bullets , which do not exist in the absence of a nonlinear response , are extremely sensitive to the specific model .",
    "x - wave dynamics seems strongly connected to pulse splitting during self - focusing in normally dispersive media , as originally predicted in 1992 @xcite , and later investigated by several authors .",
    "@xcite experimental investigation of splitting / replenishment has been reported in @xcite .",
    "the generation of x - waves may also be taken as the basis for the interpretation of the conical emission observed during the propagation of powerful ultrashort laser pulses in air , or water .",
    "@xcite    in this manuscript a preliminary settlement of x - wave nonlinear dynamics is attempted .",
    "while the forthcoming theory is developed with reference to nonlinear optics , as outlined in @xcite it applies to bose einstein condensation ( i.e. to `` matter x - waves '' ) , as well .",
    "the central idea is that , if these wave - packets can be considered somehow as `` modes of free space '' , with a given direction of propagation @xmath0 , then their nonlinear evolution is essentially two dimensional , involving @xmath0 and time .",
    "thus , under certain conditions , the problem can be reformulated and strongly simplified by adopting the well known approach of guided wave nonlinear optics .",
    "once an appropriate x - wave expansion is determined , it is not straightforward to write down `` coupled x - wave equations '' , in analogy with coupled mode equations , for the simple reason that these spatio - temporal beams are not normalizable .",
    "the first step is then to build finite energy solutions , and then use the resulting superposition of x - waves to investigate nonlinear dynamics .",
    "section i and ii cover the early stages of this approach . in section",
    "iii nonlinear regimes are addressed via a perturbative expansion .",
    "this is legitimated by the fact that progressive undistorted waves do exist in the absence of nonlinearity .",
    "the analysis clarifies in which sense x - waves are robust , and may constitute a `` paradigm '' for nonlinear 3d+1 dynamics . in section iv",
    "i consider the highly nonlinear regime .",
    "this is possible while limiting to a specific x - wave .",
    "if the wave packet is spontaneously generated during a nonlinear process ( e.g. from a bell shaped pulsed beam ) the resulting picture , for example the emergence of breathing solutions , provides a relevant insight for interpreting reported numerical and experimental findings .",
    "the last sections deal with some corollaries : compression and chirp of x - waves , and the relation with the integrable 1d nonlinear schroedinger equation .",
    "the appearance of an integrable model , enforcing the use of categories such as `` breathers '' , and its effectiveness in interpreting experimental and numerical investigations , points to an intriguing connection between nonlinear x - waves and solitons .",
    "the wave equation ( at angular carrier frequency @xmath1 ) describing paraxial propagation in normally dispersive media , at the lowest order of approximation , can be cast as @xmath2 where @xmath3 and its derivatives provide the dispersion . in a reference system traveling at the group velocity of the medium , @xmath4 , it is @xmath5 for the sake of simplicity hereafter i will consider radially symmetric beams , with @xmath6 , .    progressive undistorted waves , propagating with inverse differential velocity @xmath7 @xcite can be retrieved by looking for solutions of the form @xmath8 , thus ( @xmath9 ) @xmath10 if @xmath11 is written as a superposition of monochromatic bessel beams , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 in frequency units , the corresponding spatio - temporal dispersion relation is @xmath14 in order to have a continuous spectrum along @xmath15 , the left - hand side must be positive , thus ensuring the absence of evanescent waves .",

    "@xmath211 is a quadratic function of @xmath7s ; if @xmath212 is the velocity bandwidth ( @xmath213 ) , and observing that the spectrum of the fundamental x - waves decays as @xmath214 ( thus , roughly , @xmath215 ) , the validity of this approximation leads to a constrained maximization of @xmath211 .",
    "after a simple analysis , it must be @xmath216 while , if @xmath217 , _ the soliton regime _ : @xmath218 and , if @xmath219 , _ the chirp regime _ : @xmath220 as expected , the smaller @xmath221 , the larger @xmath222 .",
    "the above can be recast in a much simpler and more insightful formulation by introducing the dispersion ( @xmath223 ) and the diffraction ( @xmath224 ) lengths .    if @xmath225 is the s - width of @xmath201 , which in general does not correspond to the on - axis temporal duration of the pulsed beam ( this holds approximately only in the soliton regime , see ( [ avscsemplified ] ) ) , it is @xmath226 .",
    "if @xmath227 is the beam waist at the center of the pulse , with @xmath228 the spatial spectrum , by the general properties of x - waves it is ( @xmath215 ) @xmath229 , and @xmath230 .",
    "when @xmath67 is much smaller than @xmath231 , the x - wave dominates the whole spatio - temporal beam profile , this is _ the chirp regime_. conversely , when @xmath232 , _ the soliton regime _ is attained . in this case , the on - axis temporal duration is also affected by the envelope @xmath201 , while the x - wave mainly determines the spatial profile ( see ( [ avscsemplified ] ) ) .",
    "for instance , assuming to be in the soliton regime ( as witnessed by non - trivial nonlinear dynamics ) , taking a beam waist of @xmath233 and an on - axis temporal duration @xmath234 it is @xmath235 , taking @xmath159 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 , a value far beyond the propagation distances reported in experiments .",
    "@xcite @xmath222 is typically of the order of the smallest between @xmath223 and @xmath224 , because it measures the distance after which the x - wave packet starts to spread due to its finite energy .",
    "therefore one expects the approximations leading to the 1d nls model eq.([1dnls ] ) to remain valid at least in the early stages of the dynamics , a few centimeters in experiments .",
    "when @xmath0 increases , the nonlinear response gets reduced because of the sliding between the component x - waves , and the propagation becomes in essence the linear evolution of the generated x - wave pattern .",
    "once the validity of ( [ 1dnls ] ) is ascertained , the corresponding nonlinear dynamics is determined by considering the the _ effective nonlinear length _ @xmath238 , with @xmath239 , which relates to the input peak intensity , omitting inessential numerical factors , by @xmath240 ( i.e. @xmath241 is approximately given by the peak power , see below ) . in the definition of @xmath242 ,",
    "the value of @xmath196 is considered at @xmath243 , because prominent nonlinear effects are expected near the peak of the pulsed beam .",
    "the depth of focus of the progressive undistorted wave is such that the on - axis intensity keeps constant in propagation , thus enhancing nonlinear effects .",
    "this is quite similar to the nonlinear dynamics of guided modes , where the tightly confined light may favor nonlinear phenomena .    when the temporal duration @xmath231 of the envelope @xmath201 is smaller than the duration of the modulated x - wave , approximately @xmath67 , as far as @xmath244 the nonlinearity will mainly play as a self phase modulation .",

    "however , it can be readily seen that @xmath250 ( in the previous example @xmath251 ) , hence the x - wave dynamics dominates the dispersion .",
    "even if a @xmath246 soliton emerges , it essentially behaves as a non - dispersing non - diffracting x - wave .    the situation can be completely different when the peak power increases and @xmath242 reduces . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath247 , given by @xmath252 , becomes greater than unity , and hence higher - order solitons and breathers are foreseen .",
    "they will be discussed below .",
    "under suitable conditions , satisfied in the early stages of propagation , the nonlinear dynamics of an x - wave in a kerr medium can be described by the 1d nonlinear schroedinger equation with a non - uniform nonlinearity profile @xmath196 , determined by the spatial ( self-)overlap of the progressive undistorted wave .",
    "as i have shown earlier , the whole x - wave space is spanned by the fundamental x - waves .",
    "the fundamental x - shaped profile , integrable with respect to @xmath104 and typically observed in simulations and experiments , is given by @xmath253 ( see ( [ fundamentalxwavespectrum ] ) ) .",

    "the effective nls can thus be approximately rewritten as @xmath262 so that the effective nonlinear coefficient has an additional factor , roughly given by @xmath263 ( or equivalently @xmath264 ) , if compared to the plane wave value .",

    "@xmath196 resembles the mode - overlap in a waveguide and the corresponding support to the nonlinear response along propagation .",
    "this holds valid as long as @xmath265 , i.e. as long as the nonlinearity is not averaged out by the `` sliding '' of the x - waves .",
    "the fundamental soliton ( when @xmath266 ) can be expressed in terms of the peak @xmath241 of the energy distribution function ; it reads @xmath267\\xi_\\slash^{(0)}(r , t , z , s)ds\\text{,}\\ ] ] which , using ( [ avscsemplified ] ) and ( [ sigma0simplified ] ) , can be approximated by @xmath268 as anticipated , from the expression of @xmath269 , the peak intensity @xmath270 relates to @xmath271 by @xmath272 ( omitting inessential factors )",

    "conversely , in spite of this remarkable difference with solitary waves , the ( approximate ) validity of an integrable model such as ( [ 1dnlssimplified ] ) seems to establish a strong link with solitons .",
    "clearly this analysis is far from being a rigorous settlement of this conclusion , but could stimulate further research . in the following section",
    "i will discuss some additional consequences of ( [ 1dnls ] ) and ( [ 1dnlssimplified ] ) , pointing out non - trivial nonlinear dynamics of x - waves .",
    "the fundamental x - wave / fundamental soliton discussed above is of limited physical interest , because its invariant propagation is already `` embedded '' in its linear counterpart . if @xmath78 is a very narrow function , or equivalently the @xmath273width @xmath231 of @xmath274 is much wider than @xmath67 , the on - axis profile of the 3d - beam is mainly determined by the x - wave .",

    "even an idealized x - wave ( corresponding to @xmath78 proportional to a dirac delta with respect to @xmath7 , and hence to a constant @xmath201 ) is chirped in a nonlinear medium because of its spatial profile ( reflected in @xmath278 ) .",
    "since the earliest work on pulse splitting in normally dispersive kerr media , it has been known that , at the initial stages , the on - axis temporal spectrum exhibits a double peak .",
    "@xcite figure [ figurefreqshift ] shows the instantaneous frequency @xmath279 for higher order basis x - waves , more complicated spectral modulations can be expected .",
    "it is natural to identify the origin of this spectral splitting as a consequence of the self - phase modulation considered here .",
    ".[figurefreqshift],width=302 ]    it is also well stated that a chirped pulse may compress when propagating under anomalous dispersion .",
    "with reference to the two frequencies at the peaks in figure [ figurefreqshift ] , they propagate according to eq .",
    "( [ 1dnls ] ) with opposite velocities , such that the pulse gets compressed in the temporal domain . in the pulse",
    "splitting considered in @xcite , on - axis temporal compression immediately follows the spectral splitting .",
    "thus , taking the whole process of pulse - splitting and admitting that an x - wave is formed in the initial stage ( as in @xcite ) , the origin of the spectral splitting can be attributed to self - phase modulation of an x - wave .",
    "nonlinear processes are therefore well suited for generating chirped x - waves , such as those recently addressed in @xcite .",
    "while the fundamental soliton and the chirp provide the simplest corollaries of eq .",
    "( [ 1dnls ] ) , the self - trapped behavior of the 3d beam is fundamentally due to the x - shape .",
    "more interesting dynamics can be described referring to multi - soliton solutions ( obviously in _ the soliton regime _ ) .",

    "( [ nlsdimensional3 ] ) , the most relevant features are somehow taken into account by this `` simple '' model , with plasma formation and higher order dispersion playing a perturbative role .",
    "@xcite highly nonlinear phenomena , such as the shocks considered in @xcite , are expected at very high fluences and will be neglected hereby .",
    "for example , the n=2 soliton @xcite provides the approximate _ breathing nonlinear x - wave _ @xmath281^{3/2}}\\text{,}\\ ] ] with @xmath282    figure [ fbx ] shows a typical spatio - temporal profile obtained after eq .",

    "two isosurfaces are displayed : the darkest ( red ) corresponds to higher intensity.[fbx],height=302 ]    in propagation , the two - solitons , or breather- , solution pulsates and the beam evolves retaining most of its energy localized , but exhibiting the non - trivial nonlinear dynamics of the x - wave .",
    "the generation of a breather can also be thought at the origin of splitting in the first stages of propagation .",
    "it is also noticeable that higher order solitons exhibit the spectral splitting typically described in numerical simulations .    before concluding , it is fruitful to summarize the picture of the splitting / replenishment phenomenon . at the beginning a wide bell - shaped pulsed beam evolves into an x - wave , owing to the spatio - temporal pattern formation of x - wave instability @xcite",
    "then , an effective anomalous dispersion is experienced by the envelope of the finite - energy x - wave packet , and the _ chirp regime _ is entered with spectral splitting and on - axis compression .",
    "once the envelope width is sufficiently reduced , the _ soliton regime _ starts , and the increased intensity through compression feeds the generation of a higher order soliton , or breather . after some spatio - temporal oscillations , several mechanisms may intervene to stop the periodic behavior , e.g. losses ( eventually of nonlinear origin , such as two - photon absorption ) or simply that , for large propagation distances , the nonlinear response average out due to the sliding between components of the finite energy x - wave packet .",
    "progressive undistorted waves , a generalization of the non - monochromatic realm of self - invariant beams , seem to emerge as a valuable tool in numerous fields of applied research , from telecommunications to biophysics ( supported by the recent experiments in water ) .",
    "their natural appearance in nonlinear processes , analyzed hereby in the optical domain but also available in acoustics as well as in bose einstein condensation , can be considered a fundamental result .",
    "the formation of x - waves during frequency generation appears as natural as the use of their paradigm in interpreting 3d+1 nonlinear dynamics .    while x - waves are known to carry infinite energy , and their superposition has been previously employed to build finite energy solutions , in this paper for the first time i have attempted to establish a general -albeit preliminary- theoretical framework for the extension of this approach to the nonlinear case .",
    "the various steps of a basic nonlinear process , such as pulse - splitting in normally dispersive media , can be revisited in terms of x - wave nonlinear dynamics : from the initial pulse compression to splitting / replenishment .",
    "the results open the way to the investigation of elastic collisions between nonlinear x - waves , as well as to establishing a link with parametric solitary waves in quadratic media .    according to standard textbooks , a soliton ( or a bullet )",
    "is a non - perturbative solution of a nonlinear wave equation . in this sense",
    ", the non dispersive and non diffracting wave - packets analyzed here can not be considered solitons , because they exists even when a nonlinear susceptibility lacks .",
    "nevertheless , an intriguing connection between progressive undistorted waves and solitons seems to be at the inner stem of numerically and experimentally investigated phenomena . in this respect",
