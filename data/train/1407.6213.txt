    ", the ati combs of different channels give a direct measurement of their relative ionization potentials .",
    "in polyatomic molecules , where electronically excited cation states tend to undergo field - free fragmentation , different ionization channels can yield different fragments .",

    "in general , if the energy difference between two ionization channels matches the photon energy of the driving laser , the ati combs will be overlapping .",
    "more specificallyn , if the frequency of the driving laser field is resonant with a single- or multi - photon transition in the neutral or the ion , the ati combs will also be overlapping .",
    "therefore , in order to resolve the sfi channels , we varied the laser wavelengths between 400 and 800 nm ( see methods ) .",
    "this enabled us to follow the position of the ati combs as a function of wavelength .",

    "clearly , multiple channels are present at all wavelengths . however , for the 800 nm driving field , the multi - channel nature of the strong - field ionization process is obscured by the cation electronic states having energy level spacings which happen to be multiples of the driving field frequency .",
    "therefore , for the case of sf@xmath0 , the variation of the driving field frequency was required in order to resolve the multiple sfi channels involved .",
    "the crati measurements show that four main channels are involved in strong field ionization of sf@xmath0 , at all wavelengths .",
    "quantifying the relative weight of these different channels would require knowledge of the branching ratios to each associated fragment .",
    "unfortunately , these are unknown . in order to theoretically determine these weights , we calculated the tunnel ionization probability @xmath11 for each channel @xmath8 by using a previously described approach @xcite and averaging over all molecular orientations .",
    "ionization calculations used a 1/2-cycle 800-nm sin@xmath12 pulse at 10@xmath13 w / cm@xmath12 peak intensity .",

    "two main factors determine the channel sfi rates : ( i ) the ionization potential of the channel  the ionization rate decreases exponentially with @xmath15 ; ( ii ) the topography of the ionizing molecular orbital  nodes in the plane perpendicular to the laser polarization tend to suppress the ionization probability .",
    "the first effect was long considered to be dominant : sfi mainly occurs from the highest occupied molecular orbital , even though deeper channels can be observed under specific conditions , such as in aligned molecules .",
    "however , in a crati study of n - butane @xcite , it was shown that excited state channels dominate over the ground state channel , despite their higher i@xmath3s .",
    "the results from fig . [ figcrati](b ) are alike due to geometrical effects in sfi of sf@xmath0 which overcome the exponential dependence on @xmath15 , even for unaligned targets .",
    "sfi involving multiple channels generates multiple interfering pathways in high - order harmonic generation .",
    "the harmonic signal is determined by the coherent sum over all possible channels ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in the following , we present a simple model of hhg in which the sfi channels are considered to be uncoupled .",
    "specifically , we assume that there are no sub - cycle non - adiabatic multi - electron transitions ( nme ) which would coherently couple cation states : an electron leaving a given cation electronic state will recombine to the same state .",
    "the harmonic dipole moment is determined by the sfi probability , the propagation of the electron in the continuum , and the recombination cross section @xcite .",
    "the propagation in the continuum induces a dephasing of the harmonic emission , corresponding to the phase accumulated by the molecule between ionization and recombination .",
    "this is given by @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the difference between the ionization potential of the channel under consideration and the ground state ionization channel ( x ) , and @xmath18 is the electron propagation time in the continuum , which increases with harmonic order from 0.6 fs to 1.7 fs for short trajectories at 800 nm .",
    "we make the approximation that the recombination dipole moment @xmath19 is equal to the field free xuv photoionization dipole moment .",

    "the picture , which is very complex in the case of photoionization where many channels have similar cross sections ( fig .",
    "[ figtheory](a ) ) , appears to be simplified by sfi .",
    "the tunneling probability from the highest occupied molecular orbitals is significantly reduced by the presence of nodes in the orbitals , such that deeper channels are favoured , as illustrated in fig . [ figcrati](b ) . as a result",
    ", the harmonic signal is dominated by two channels , c and a , respectively below and above 25 ev .",
    "this property is quite remarkable : due to its sensitivity to tunnel ionization , high harmonic spectroscopy can isolate channels which may be difficult to distinguish in photoionization experiments ( for instance , the a and b channels are not distinguished in xuv ionization ) .",
    "the maxima of the dominant channels are related to resonances in the photoionization cross section : an autoionization resonance for channel c ( 5a@xmath216t@xmath22 ) and a shape resonance ( 1t@xmath23t@xmath24 ) for channel a @xcite .",

    "the sf@xmath0 spectrum extends to higher orders and shows a pronounced minimum at harmonic 17 , as was previously observed at a lower laser intensity @xcite .",
    "varying the laser intensity in our experiment does not modify the position of this minimum , as expected from our simple model .",
    "this minimum is a first indication that points towards a transition between channels c and a at around 25 ev ( fig .",
    "[ figtheory ] ( b ) ) .",
    "however , a definite identification of such a transition requires new methods in high - harmonic spectroscopy . these are discussed below .",
    "how can we identify the involved channels without needing a full theoretical model of the harmonic emission ?",
    "such identification requires a differential measurement , a measurement which reveals the response of the molecular system to a variation of the laser parameters .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the variation of the harmonic signal with laser ellipticity , @xmath27 .",
    "the measured harmonic signal as a function of laser ellipticity in argon and in sf@xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ figellipticity](a - b ) .",
    "the harmonic intensity decays exponentially with @xmath28 @xcite and can be fitted by a gaussian @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the harmonic order and @xmath31 the variation with ellipticity .",
    "the ellipticity - dependent responses of argon and sf@xmath0 are remarkably similar for harmonic 21 whereas that of argon is higher for harmonic 15 .",
    "high - order harmonic emission in an elliptical laser field can be described in a quasi - static semi - classical picture , as follows .",
    "first , electrons tunnel out of the molecule with a finite transverse momentum distribution .",
    "this distribution is dictated by the molecular orbital structure , filtered through the tunneling process @xcite .",
    "if the electron wavepacket at the exit of the tunnel is spatially localized , then the momentum distribution is broad .",
    "the transverse momentum distributions associated with argon and the a and c channels in sf@xmath0 , calculated using the approach described in @xcite , are shown in fig . [ figellipticity](c ) .",
    "the distributions have a gaussian profile , with the same width for argon and the a channel , while the c channel shows a broader distribution .",
    "this is consistent with the more localized character of the homo-3 ( c ) rather than the diffuse homo-1 ( a ) . during propagation in the continuum",
    ", the electron wavepacket spreads transversly .",
    "the spread of the returning electron wavepacket depends on the time spent in the continuum ( and thus on the harmonic order , the lowest harmonics being emitted before the highest harmonics @xcite ) , but also on the initial transverse momentum distribution : the broader the initial transverse momentum distribution , the broader the returning wavepacket . with an elliptically polarized driving field , the orthogonal component of the field shifts the electron in the lateral direction , leading to a suppression of the recollision probability .",
    "such suppression depends on both the trajectory length and the initial channel - specific transverse momentum .",
    "therefore , the harmonic response @xmath32 as a function of ellipticity serves as a fingerprint of the molecular orbital , i.e. of the sfi channel .",
    "the variation of @xmath33 with harmonic order is shown in fig .",
    "normalization to the response of argon suppresses the linear dependence of the ellipticity response with harmonic order , which simply reflects the change in electron trajectory length . above h17 ,",

    "rabbit is based on photoionization of a target gas by high - order harmonics , in the presence of a weak fundamental laser field .",

    "the phase of this oscillation @xmath37 encodes the relative phase between the neighbouring harmonics @xmath38 and @xmath39 : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the phase difference between harmonics @xmath38 and @xmath39 and @xmath42 is a scattering phase intrinsic to the target ( the atomic phase , i.e. the phase accumulated by the photoionized electron in the atomic scattering potential @xcite ) .    in figure [ figrabbit](b ) , we show the measured harmonic phase difference obtained using sf@xmath0 as a generating gas and argon as a detecting gas .",
    "the harmonic phase difference increases with harmonic order but a clear deviation is observed at sb16 , reflecting a specific phase difference between harmonic 15 and 17 .",
    "a similar behavior was reported in @xcite .",
    "calculations of the harmonic phase , within the strong - field approximation and using the saddle point method , were performed for the two channels expected to dominate the harmonic emission in this energy range : the a ( green ) and c ( purple ) channels .",
    "the resulting harmonic phase difference shows a similar increase with harmonic order for the two channels , reflecting the temporal dispersion of electron trajectories leading to emission of different harmonics @xcite .",
    "the calculations are in good agreement with the experiment for sb 18 to 22 , associated with channel a , and for sb 12 - 14 , associated with channel c. we note that a transition from the c to a hhg channels between harmonic 15 and 17 would produce a shift in the phase of sideband 16 .",
    "the electron trajectory leading to a given harmonic order slightly differs between the two channels , and this difference is enough to induce a significant effect on the phase accumulated along the whole trajectory .",
    "however , the results from this model do not agree with the experimental data : the calculated @xmath43 for sb16 is around 1.3 rad while the measured phase shift is 4.8 rad .",
    "this shows that there is an additional dephasing of the harmonic emission between channels a and c which is directly measured by experiment .",

    "the phase of the emission from the a channel seems insensitive to @xmath48 and dominated by @xmath50 .",
    "the complete calculation of the harmonic emission from vibrating molecules is beyond the scope of this article . as a first step",
    ", we evaluated the modifications of the strong field ionization yield resulting from molecular vibrations in the two dominant modes seen in the experiment : @xmath50 and @xmath46 .",

    "<S> two of them , identified by monitoring the ellipticity dependence of the high - harmonic emission , are found to dominate the harmonic signal . </S>",
    "<S> a switch from the homo-3 to the homo-1 channel at 26 ev is confirmed by a phase jump in the harmonic emission , and by the differing dynamical responses to molecular vibrations . </S>",
    "<S> this study demonstrates a _ modus operandi _ for extending high - harmonic spectroscopy to polyatomic molecules , where complex attosecond dynamics are expected .    in the simplest view of molecular strong - field ionization , the most probable valence electron to be removed by a strong laser field is the most weakly bound one , namely that from the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is based on quasi - static , single active electron pictures and the exponential decay of the tunnel ionization probability through a field - suppressed coulomb barrier @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , even in a quasi - static picture , the tunnel ionization probability also depends on the spatial structure of the molecular orbital @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , more than one electron could get driven coherently by the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> the time scales of electron motions in molecules may not be fast compared to the laser period and the adiabatic approximation inherent to the quasi - static picture may fail : non - adiabatic multi - electron ( nme ) dynamics can ensue @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , strong field ionization of molecules is significantly more complex than from atoms , with possible contributions from multiple channels , leaving the ion in a coherent superposition of electronic states . </S>",
    "<S> such ionic excitation can result in multi - electron processes and ultra - fast charge migrations on an attosecond timescale @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the signatures of multi - channel ionization in above threshold ionization ( ati ) @xcite and high harmonic generation ( hhg ) @xcite are fundamentally different . in ati , </S>",
    "<S> different channels produce different electron energy combs . </S>",
    "<S> the relative energy shifts of these combs depend on both the ponderomotive energy , reflecting the laser intensity , and the vertical ionization potential of the channel in question . the contributions of different channels , </S>",
    "<S> each leading to an energy - shifted ati comb , are incoherently summed in the detected photoelectron signal . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in hhg , the different ionization channels connect the same initial and final states ( _ i.e. _ neutral ground electronic state ) and therefore their contributions are coherently summed in the harmonic emission ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hhg mechanism can thus be described as a multi - channel interferometer . </S>",
    "<S> the weights of the interfering paths are determined by the ionization yields and the recombination dipole moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> resonances in the recombination process ( e.g. due to the presence of an auto - ionizing state or a shape resonance ) strongly increase these dipole moments in specific energy ranges . </S>",
    "<S> the relative phases of the interfering paths are complex and have important contributions from all steps of the process . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the hhg mechanism can serve as an extremely sensitive probe which coherently encodes the contribution of the different quantum paths involved in the process  providing rich spectroscopic signatures of the strong field light matter interaction .        </S>",
    "<S> since the contribution of small amplitude channels is enhanced by the interferometric nature of the process , high - harmonic spectroscopy has the potential to resolve strong field multi - electron phenomena with extremely high sensitivity . </S>",
    "<S> however , this task imposes significant challenges . to date </S>",
    "<S> , the identification of channels in hhg has been demonstrated in small linear ( diatomic or triatomic ) molecules via the manipulation of the molecular alignment angle with respect to the generating laser polarization @xcite . for polyatomic molecules , </S>",
    "<S> field - free 3d alignment is achieveable @xcite but remains challenging in general . </S>",
    "<S> therefore we propose a more direct control over the multi - channel interferometer , illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig0 ] . </S>",
    "<S> can we control the relative contributions from each arm ? </S>",
    "<S> can we identify the phases associated with the different paths ? in the following , we directly address these issues .    in this letter , we combine complementary strong field measurements to develop a _ multi - modal _ high - harmonic spectroscopy . to illustrate this , we chose a polyatomic system in which many channels can contribute to the harmonic emission : sf@xmath0 , whose four highest occupied molecular orbitals ( each multiply degenerate ) lie within less than 3 ev . due to its symmetry ( o@xmath1 point group ) </S>",
    "<S> , this system can not be aligned in the laboratory frame . </S>",
    "<S> the identification of the channels contributing to hhg and the measurement of multi - channel ionization dynamics is thus particularly challenging .    in order to discern the ionization mechanism , we performed channel - resolved ati ( crati ) measurements on sf@xmath0 @xcite for laser wavelengths ranging from 800 to 400 nm , revealing that at least four channels contribute to the strong - field ionization ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig0 ] ) . using high - harmonic spectroscopy </S>",
    "<S> , we introduce a new experimental method for identifying channels based on hhg with elliptically polarized light . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of this reveals a clear transition between two dominant channels around 26 ev . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we used rabbit measurements ( resolution of attosecond beating by interference of two - photon transitions @xcite ) to reveal the possible influence of resonances in the hhg process @xcite . finally we induced vibrational dynamics in the ground electronic state of sf@xmath0 ( via stimulated raman pumping ) in order to explore the influence of molecular geometry on the different channels . </S>",
    "<S> the results of these experiments , corroborated by state - of - the - art ab - initio calculations ,    allowed us to identify the homo-1 and homo-3 ionization channels as the major contributors to hhg in sf@xmath0 . </S>"
