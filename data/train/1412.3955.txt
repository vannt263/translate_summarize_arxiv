    "another avenue of research is lower - bounds on cyclability of graphs in restricted families .",
    "for example , every 3-connected claw - free graph has cyclability at least 6 @xcite and every @xmath10-connected cubic planar graph has cyclability at least 23 @xcite .",

    "hypohamiltonian graphs appear in combinatorial optimization and are used to define facets of the traveling salesman polytope @xcite .",
    "curiously , the computational complexity of deciding whether a graph is hypohamiltonian seems to be open .    to our knowledge",

    "finally , we prove that even for the planar case , the following negative result holds .",
    "[ thm : no - kernel ] cyclability , parameterized by @xmath0 , has no polynomial kernel unless @xmath4 when restricted to cubic planar graphs .",
    "the above result indicates that the cyclability does not follow the kernelization behavior of many other problems ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) for which surface embeddability enables the construction of polynomial kernels .",
    "+ _ our techniques_. theorem [ thm : w ] is proved in section  [ hardness ] and the proof is a reduction from the standard parameterization of the clique problem .",
    "the two key ingredients in the proof of theorem  [ mainalgs ] are a new , two - step , version of the _ irrelevant vertex technique _ and a new combinatorial concept of _ cyclic linkages _ along with a strong notion of _ vitality _ on them ( vital linkages played an important role in the graph minors series , in  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ mainalgs ] is presented in section  [ profsalg ] .",
    "below , we give a rough sketch of our method .",
    "we work with a variant of cyclability in which some vertices ( initially all ) are colored .",
    "we only require that every @xmath0 colored vertices lie on a common cycle .",
    "if the treewidth of the input graph @xmath1 is `` small '' ( bounded by an appropriate function of @xmath0 ) , we employ a dynamic programming routine to solve the problem .",
    "otherwise , there exists a cycle in a plane embedding of @xmath1 such that the graph @xmath43 in the interior of that cycle is `` bidimensional '' ( contains a large subdivided wall ) but is still of bounded treewidth .",
    "this structure permits to distinguish in @xmath43 a sequence @xmath44 of , sufficiently many , concentric cycles that are all traversed by some , sufficiently many , paths of @xmath43 . our first aim is to check whether the distribution of the colored vertices in these cycles yields some `` big uncolored area '' of @xmath43 . in this case",
    "we declare some `` central '' vertex of this area _ problem - irrelevant _ in the sense that its removal creates an equivalent instance of the problem .",
    "if such an area does not exists , then @xmath42 is `` uniformly '' distributed inside the cycle sequence @xmath44 .",
    "our next step is to set up a sequence of instances of the problem , each corresponding to the graph `` cropped '' by the interior of the cycles of @xmath44 , where all vertices of a sufficiently big `` annulus '' in it are now uncolored .",
    "as the graphs of these instances are subgraphs of @xmath43 and therefore have bounded treewidth , we can get an answer for all of them by performing a sequence of dynamic programming calls ( each taking a linear number of steps ) . at this point",
    ", we prove that if one of these instances is a -instance then initial instance is a -instance , so we just report it and stop .",
    "otherwise , we pick a colored vertex inside the most `` central '' cycle of @xmath44 and prove that this vertex is _ color - irrelevant _ ,",
    "i.e. , an equivalent instance is created when this vertex is not any more colored . in any case , the algorithm produces either a solution or some `` simpler '' equivalent instance that either contains a vertex less or a colored vertex less .",
    "this permits a linear number of recursive calls of the same procedure . to prove that these two last critical steps work as intended , we have to introduce several combinatorial tools .",
    "one of them is the notion of strongly vital linkages , a variant of the notion of vital linkages introduced in  @xcite , which we apply to terminals traversed by cycles instead of terminals linked by paths , as it has been done in  @xcite .",
    "this notion of vitality permits a significant restriction of the expansion of cycles which certify that sets of @xmath0 vertices are cyclable and is able to justify both critical steps of our algorithm .",
    "the proofs of the combinatorial results that support our algorithm are presented in section  [ linkagelems ] and we believe that they have independent combinatorial importance .    the proof of theorem  [ thm : no - kernel ] is given in section  [ hardness ] and is based on the cross - composition technique introduced by bodlaender , jansen , and kratsch  in  @xcite .",
    "we show that a variant of the hamiltonicity problem and - cross - composes to cyclabilty .",
    "_ structure of the paper_. the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ defakl ]",
    "we give a set of definitions that are necessary for the presentation of our algorithm .",
    "the main steps of the algorithm are presented in section  [ profsalg ] and the combinatorial results ( along with the necessary definitions ) are presented in section  [ linkagelems ] .",
    "section [ dp ] is devoted to a dynamic programming algorithm for cyclability and section [ hardness ] contains the co - w[1]-hardness of cyclability for general graphs and the proof of the non - existence of a polynomial kernel on planar graphs .",

    "this prompts us to conjecture the following :      moreover , while we have proved that cyclability is co - w[1]-hard , we have no evidence which level of the parameterized complexity hierarchy it belongs to ( lower than the xp class ) .",
