    "we solve the radial poisson equation iteratively and finally obtain a self - consistent free electron density which forms a polarization cloud close to the nucleus and dilutes for larger radii .",
    "due to the screening of the free electrons the energy levels and hence the emission energies are shifted .",

    "[ shift ] , we obtain line shifts to lower energies in the order of some ev depending on both the plasma temperature @xmath22 and the average free electron density @xmath23 .",
    "this effect is referred to as plasma polarization shift and can be explained as follows @xcite : the free electrons screen the nucleus resulting in lower values of binding energies . as the 1s level is localized closer to the nucleus than 2p , it is more affected by the screening of the nucleus and",
    "thus experiences the larger shift . since the emission energy is given by the difference of the two involved levels the spectral line is red shifted to lower energies . the red shift increases with rising free electron density as the screening of the nucleus rises as well .",
    "however , the red shift decreases with rising plasma temperature .",
    "this is due to the fact that the self - consistently determined free electron density within the ion sphere is not constant but radially dependent .",
    "a screening cloud of free electrons is formed around the nucleus and the density dilutes for larger radii . the higher the temperature the more this screening cloud",
    "is spatially extended ( smeared out ) and the actual free electron density close to the nucleus decreases , resulting in a lower red shift .",

    "plasma polarization is not only important to calculate the accurate emission line positions but also to determine the plasma composition itself .",
    "in contrast to emission lines , a single level surrounded by plasma is shifted to higher energies , i.e. closer to the continuum .",
    "depending on the plasma parameters this shift can be that large that the continuum is reached and the bound electron is set free ( pressure ionization , mott effect @xcite ) .",
    "hence , we obtain another free electron and a new ion species . in the following",
    "we will outline how we calculated the plasma composition taking into account the polarization shifts we determined within the ion sphere model . for more details see again @xcite .    assuming a local thermal equilibrium",

    "let us now consider the electronic partition function @xmath35 .",
    "as for the electrons no internal degrees of freedom have to be taken into account , we split the partition function into the ideal part represented by the statistical weight and a boltzmann factor containing the interaction energy , @xmath36 as we take into account different ionization stages the statistical weight of the @xmath29-th successive ionization step will add up to @xmath37 .",
    "the electron interaction energy @xmath38 is treated as a rigid , momentum independent quasi - particle shift of the free particle energies and divided into an electron - ion interaction term and electron - electron interaction term . according to @xcite",

    "@xcite obtained from the flychk code @xcite ( black dashed line , fwhm of charge state distribution in gray ) .",
    "we see a sharp rise of the charge state and a rapid sequence of ionization stages are passed through for temperatures below 40 ev .",
    "this is the regime of m - shell ionization , binding energies are rather low and pressure ionization plays an important role .",
    "our results for the average ion charge match the upper fwhm of the charge state distribution of neumayer _ et al .",
    "_ , i.e. , at the same temperature our calculations give not only a higher charge state but also larger energy shifts of the emission energies .",
    "the differences arise from the different treatment of the variety of bound states and pressure ionization within the approaches . as there are several hundred transitions closely distributed for lower charge states",
    "usually a simplification is applied for better handling .",
    "flychk uses super - configuration transition arrays ( effective bound states ) weighted by respective transition rates rather than the complete level structure@xcite .",
    "we do not average over several levels , but take only low lying excited states with rather high probability of occupation into account .",
    "further , in the flychk code continuum lowering is treated within a stewart - pyatt like model to implement medium corrections to the ionization energies .",
    "the model interpolates between the two limiting cases : debye screening for dilute and hot plasma on the one hand and screening within an ion sphere model with constant free electron density for dense and cool plasmas an the other hand@xcite .",
    "if bound states merge into the continuum the calculations get discontinuous since these states suddenly disappear from the implemented rate equations . using effective bound states",
    "reduces these events . within our approach",
    "there is no such discontinuity thanks to the use of the planck - larkin renormalization of bound states .",
    "as shown above we also use an ion sphere model to calculate the continuum lowering , however , the free electron density within the sphere is not constant but radially dependent .",
    "all in all we observe several mott transitions in solid density argon at temperatures below 50 ev which lead to a higher degree of ionization .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ mon ] sodium , neon and flour like states seem to be rather stable .",
    "hence , the slope of the charge state in fig .  [ total ] flattens for rising plasma temperatures from about 40 ev to 120 ev .",
    "our results arrive at the values obtained by neumayer _",
    "_ as the ion charges rise and pressure ionization becomes less important .",
    "to construct synthetic spectra from the shifted emission energies every line as well as its fine structure components is assigned a lorentz profile with natural line width @xmath49 and maximum intensity @xmath50 , @xmath51 the central line position @xmath52 is given by the plasma shifted line positions .",
    "typically the @xmath53 component of the k@xmath54 transition provides the main contribution and we identify our emission energies obtained so far with these line components . to take into account fine structure splitting , we add the @xmath55 components semi - empirically . from nist tables",
    "@xcite it is known that the fine structure splitting of ar k@xmath54 is 2.01 ev .    the maximum intensity is mainly given by the emitter abundance in the plasma .",
    "we determine all intensities relatively with respect to a reference state , @xmath56 for the electron transitions considered here , we assume nearly constant dipole matrix elements @xmath57 with respect to excitation and ionization of outer shells since the one particle wave functions @xmath58 ( initial state , 2p ) and @xmath59 ( final state , 1s ) change only very slightly @xcite .",
    "hence , the einstein coefficients for spontanious emisssion is simply @xmath60 .",
    "the lorentzians are summed up and convoluted with a gaussian profile of width @xmath61 to take into account instrumental broadening of the measurements .    according to neumayer _",
    "@xcite we varied the broadening parameters within the range of some ev and found the most suitable combination in a natural linewidth of @xmath62 ev and a gaussian width of @xmath63 ev .",
    "a selection of spectra for different plasma temperatures is shown in fig .",
    "[ 4spektren ] . keeping the total density and plasma temperature fixed , the free electron density is given by the composition calculations . shown",
    "are some typical spectra : at low temperatures up to some 10 ev we are again in the regime of m - shell ionization . since the emission energies vary only slightly the lines of from ar@xmath64 to ar@xmath65 group within one large main peak which shifts to higher energies with rising temperatures .",
    "with further increase of the temperature we enter the regime of l - shell ionization , the main peak becomes less prominent and several distinguishable peaks appear corresponding to the separated emission energies of the respective ions .",
    "we calculated spectra up 160 ev where the last l - shell satellite is dominant",
    ".    experimentally observed higher emission energies mainly arise from ions with only one or two electrons ( ly-@xmath66 , he-@xmath66 , intercombination line ) and represent the conditions of the blow - off plasma instead of bulk properties .",
    "we apply a superposition of our spectra for different temperatures to model the experimental results obtained by neumayer _",
    "_ @xcite . to obtain the best fit the weight of the different spectra",
    "is determined within a variational approach using the method of least squares .",
    "results for the best fit and the corresponding temperature distribution are shown in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] and fig .",
    "[ temperaturedistribution ] , respectively .",
    "the superimposed spectrum shows a good agreement especially for the m - shell satellites .",
    "the position of the main peak is rather sensitive to the plasma temperature . the nearly same contribution of 20 ev and 30 ev and the slightly overestimated width in fig .",
    "[ bestfit ] suggest an intermediate temperature of about 27 ev to best represent the m - shell peak . at a first glimpse",
    "the agreement with the l - shell satellites is less satisfying .",
    "the peaks are at correct positions but the widths seem to small .",
    "we attribute this to our approximation of the natural line widths .",
    "we use a single value of @xmath49 which implies the same lifetime for all considered states .",
    "but especially highly ionized and excited states experience shorter lifetimes and hence show a larger natural width . accordingly",
    "the l - shell emission lines would blur and give a better fit of the energy spectrum above 2980 ev .",
    "the temperature distribution we obtain is similar to the theoretical results of neumayer _ _ et al.__@xcite : a two - peaked curve with the first focus at lower temperatures of some 10 ev , the second focus at more than 100 ev higher temperatures and a less pronounced region in between .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between the distribution of neumayer _ et al . _ and the results shown here : our first focus lies at about 20 ev lower plasma temperature .",
    "this difference is due to the different results of the composition calculations .",
    "the results for undisturbed peak positions are rather the same , showing blue shifted emission energies as described above .",
    "but as we obtain higher degrees of ionization at lower temperatures , we also see the blue shift of emission energies at lower temperatures and hence we obtain a temperature of about 27 ev instead of 50 ev to fit the main peak of the measured spectrum .",
    "_ discussed several mechanisms like resistive heating or radiative heating that might help to explain the absence of temperatures below 50 ev .",
    "however , our results suggest that these influences might not be as substantial as the authors assumed .",
    "we see that the details of the synthetic spectra need further discussion .",
    "firstly , the unperturbed spectra calculated by different approaches here and in ref.@xcite show differently distributed transitions for the l - shell excitations .",
    "our close lying ar@xmath67 and ar@xmath68 states are in contrast to the data used by neumayer _",
    "_ where these states are more separated . secondly , the distribution of transitions as a function of the energy is broader in ref.@xcite so that the l - shell peaks in the final spectrum merge . whereas we obtain clearly separated structures .",
    "the calculation of atomic states and transitions is a question of the used codes and surely needs special consideration in future works .",
    "furthermore , the broadening of the lines is different in both approaches .",
    "using the same parameter values for the broadening of all lines overestimates the width for the main peak ( ar@xmath69 to ar@xmath65 ) and underrates the width for the higher lying peaks as pointed out above .",
    "a more detailed discrimination of the widths would improve the agreement between theory and experimental data .",
    "in particular , the low minima between the theoretical peaks will possibly be smeared out .",
    "a quantum statistical approach to the line width would be desirable which is well elaborated for h - like systems but needs further development for mid-@xmath70 materials .",
    "the inclusion of plasma effects , especially shifts and the merging of bound states with the continuum , is important to discuss the composition of the plasma and the density of free electrons .",
    "we have shown that such effects have significant influence on the inferred temperature distribution . however , in order to describe the origin of the inferred temperature profile , kinetic codes and hydrodynamic simulations are inevitable . in general we have shown that k - alpha spectroscopy is an interesting means for plasma diagnostics and allows an estimate of the temperature profile in warm dense matter .",
