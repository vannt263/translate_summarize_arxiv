    "quark masses are fundamental parameters of the standard model but due to confinement they can not be measured directly by experiment and therefore any mass quoted always depends on the scheme ( and scale ) in which it was computed .",
    "the present world average value for @xmath1 has an error of approximately 17%  @xcite .",
    "this should be compared to the value quoted for the experimental mass of the @xmath2 meson which is accurate to within less than 0.1% .",
    "the mass of the charm quark is a difficult quantity to compute since it is light enough to be challenging for heavy quark methods and yet heavy enough such that the lattice spacing may be too coarse for the compton wavelength .",
    "there has recently been several calculations of this quantity from the lattice @xcite . in particular , a detailed study by rolf and",
    "sint @xcite has been presented in the continuum limit , thus eliminating the error arising from lattice artifacts .",
    "however , the effects of including quark loops within these calculations has so far been omitted .",
    "this work is an attempt to estimate these effects and obtain a result in full qcd ( albeit at fixed lattice spacing ) . in the interest of reducing errors resulting from a finite lattice spacing ,",
    "we investigate several different formulations of @xmath0 on the lattice .",
    "we have previously published results from this data set on the hyperfine and p - wave mass splittings  @xcite .",
    "the mass splittings between the p - wave and s - wave mesons have been compared to the mass of the @xmath3 meson recently discovered by babar .",
    "in this section we outline the definitions of bare quark mass used in this study and discuss some aspects of the renormalisation and improvement procedures .",
    "we use three different definitions , the first of which is the vector ward identity ( vwi ) , given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hopping parameter , the subscript @xmath6 denotes the heavy quark and the subscript crit denotes the value of @xmath5 which corresponds to zero quark mass .",
    "the second definition arises from the pcac relation ( avwi ) and is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 label the heavy and light quark respectively , @xmath10 is the local axial current and @xmath11 is the pseudoscalar density . the axial current has been @xmath12 improved .",
    "the scaling studies of rolf and sint  @xcite show that @xmath13 lattice artifacts of the non - perturbative renormalisation scheme can be large . as some of the required coefficients",
    "have not been computed non - perturbatively at the parameter values used in this study , we use the ( boosted ) perturbative values , thus the lattice artifacts are @xmath14 . as the lattice spacing is relatively coarse ,",
    "we utilise an alternative definition of @xmath0 .",
    "this is obtained by using the bare value obtained from the vwi , which is then identified as the `` rest mass '' in the fnal formalism  @xcite . at tree level , this is defined as @xmath15 we use the one loop expression to connect the vector mass to the quark mass from ref .",
    "@xcite . in this work",
    "we use the rest mass of the hadron to compare with experiment , in the fnal formalism the kinetic mass of the hadron is used .",
    "this is planned in future work .",
    "matching onto the @xmath16 scheme is performed at one loop in perturbation theory for all definitions of the quark mass at the scale @xmath17 and the associated systematic uncertainty is estimated by matching at @xmath18 .",
    "there are four ensembles of gauge configurations available for computing the meson correlation functions but here we present details and results for the dynamical and coarsest quenched set only .",
    "the dynamical ensemble was generated with two degenerate flavors of sea quarks with a mass around the strange quark .",
    "furthermore , the lattice spacing for the dynamical set was matched to that of the coarsest quenched ensemble ( presented here ) to facilitate the study of effects due to sea quarks without ambiguities arising from different lattice spacing errors .",
    "all ensembles were generated using a wilson gauge action and the non - perturbatively @xmath12 improved fermion action was used to generate the quark propagators .",
    "these details are summarised in table  [ table:1 ] and further details of the procedures for generating the dynamical ensemble and matching to the quenched data set can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    ".lattice parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +",
    "there is no clear evidence of the effects of the sea quarks on the mass of the charm quark .",
    "this is almost certainly due to the unphysically heavy sea quark masses .",
    "however , large systematic uncertainties make it difficult to compare the quenched and dynamical results .",
    "one major hurdle in reducing the systematic error is the size of the lattice spacing .",
    "the dynamical results have been obtained at a fixed lattice spacing which is coarse . in comparison with the quenched case , it is very expensive to reduce the spacing in unquenched simulations and therefore we are unable to take the continuum limit which would enable us to control the systematic error . in response to this , we are investigating which formulation of @xmath0 on the lattice minimizes discretization errors .",
    "the mass independent renormalisation scheme suffers from large lattice artefacts of @xmath19 for quark masses at coarse lattice spacings  @xcite .",
    "some of the coefficients required for this scheme have large @xmath12 ambiguities themselves .",
    "moreover , not all of these coefficients are known non - perturbatively for the dynamical case and so we have resorted to one - loop perturbation theory in this scheme .",
    "the only way to control errors further is to take the continuum limit which , as discussed , is unfeasible with the current generation of computers .",
    "an alternative approach is that of heavy quark methods such as the fnal formalism , which removes mass dependent lattice artefacts of @xmath20 . with careful application of this formalism",
    ", we may be able to make a comparison between the quenched and dynamical case .",
    "this is the subject of future work , as well as taking the continuum limit in the quenched case to control remaining lattice artefacts .",
