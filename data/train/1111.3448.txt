    "physical phenomena described by reduced or effective non - hermitian hamiltonians are often encountered in a wide class of quantum or classical systems , for example in nuclear or condensed - matter physics of open systems @xcite or in optical systems in presence of optical gain or losses @xcite . among non - hermitian hamiltonians",
    ", great interest has been devoted in the past two decades to study the properties of parity - time ( @xmath0 ) invariant hamiltonians , which possess a real - valued energy spectrum below a symmetry - breaking point in spite of non - hermiticity .",
    "such a class of non - hermitian hamiltonians has been originally introduced by carl bender in the framework of non - hermitian extensions of quantum mechanics and quantum field theories @xcite , and found recently an increasing interest since the proposal of physical systems described by @xmath0-symmetric hamiltonians , including optical @xcite and electronic @xcite systems .",
    "complex periodic potentials @xcite realize a kind of synthetic complex crystals , which show rather unusual scattering and transport properties as compared to ordinary crystals .",
    "complex crystals have been investigated in different areas of physics , ranging from matter waves @xcite to optics @xcite . in optics , a complex crystal with @xmath0 invariance",
    "is realized by introduction of index and balanced gain / loss modulations in a dielectric medium @xcite .",
    "complex crystals can be also realized in atom optics experiments exploiting the interaction of near resonant light with an open two - level system .",
    "scattering of matter waves from purely absorbing optical lattices was reported in a few earlier experiments refs.@xcite . as noticed by berry @xcite ,",
    "although in such experiments on matter waves @xmath0 symmetry is not strictly realized and the complex potentials are purely absorptive , the analysis is essentially the same , since the mean loss simply represents an overall exponential decay of the wave . from the theoretical side , bragg scattering , diffraction and transport properties",
    "have been extensively investigated for sinusoidal @xmath0-symmetric complex crystals @xcite , revealing some interesting properties such as violation of the friedel s law of bragg scattering @xcite , double refraction and nonreciprocal diffraction @xcite , and unidirectional bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "in particular , in a recent work @xcite it was predicted that a sinusoidal @xmath0-symmetric sinusoidal crystal of finite length near the spontaneous @xmath0-symmetry breaking point can act as a unidirectional invisible medium , i.e. the crystal is almost reflectionless when probed from one side , and transmission occurs as if the crystal were absent .",
    "such an unidirectional invisibility of @xmath0-symmetric bragg scatters near the symmetry - breaking point was previously predicted to occur in ref.@xcite for waveguide bragg gratings which combine matched periodic modulations of refractive index and loss / gain yielding asymmetrical mode coupling . in these previous studies @xcite , invisibility was explained on the basis of a coupled - mode theory describing bragg scattering and coupling of counter - propagating waves in the crystal , which is rather common in the optical context @xcite .",
    "such an analysis predicts that , for a shallow grating near the @xmath0 symmetry breaking point , the sinusoidal crystal appears to be invisible when probed from one side _",
    "independently _ of the crystal length .    in this work we re - consider the scattering properties of the sinusoidal @xmath0-symmetric potential and derive _ exact _ analytical expressions for reflection and transmission coefficients .",
    "the analysis shows that application of the coupled - mode theory in the standard form fails to predict the correct scattering properties in case of long crystals .",
    "in particular , as at short lengths the crystal is reflectionless and invisible when probed from one side ( according to previous studies @xcite ) , at intermediate lengths the crystal remains reflectionless but not invisible . at even longer crystal lengths , both unidirectional reflectionless and invisibility properties",
    "are broken .",
    "let us consider the stationary schrdinger equation for a quantum particle in a locally periodic and complex potential v(x ) , which in dimensionless form reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the energy of the incident particle and @xmath3 is the complex scattering potential with period @xmath4 , which is nonvanishing in the interval @xmath5 .",
    "the crystal length @xmath6 is assumed to be an integer multiple of the lattice period @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of unit cells in the crystal . as mentioned in the introduction , eq.(1 ) describes bragg scattering of matter waves from a complex potential in the non - interacting regime , which applies e.g. to a dilute cold atomic beam ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in this case , the complex potential arises from the interaction of near resonant light with an open two - level system , and it is generally absorptive . in this work we will mainly focus our attention to the @xmath0-symmetric sinusoidal potential , assuming @xmath9\\ ] ] for @xmath5 , and @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the lattice amplitude and @xmath14 measures the strength of the non - hermitian part of the potential .",
    "the spectral properties of the @xmath0-symmetric sinusoidal potential ( 3 ) have been investigated in refs.@xcite . for the infinitely - extended crystal ,",
    "the energy spectrum remains real - valued for @xmath15 , and breaking of the @xmath0 phase is attained at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "here we consider bragg scattering of incoming waves with momentum @xmath17 close to the bragg value @xmath18 , i.e. with energy @xmath19 close to @xmath20 , and typically will assume a modulation @xmath13 of the potential much smaller than the energy @xmath2 .",
    "+ it should be noted that bragg scattering of optical waves in one - dimensional bragg grating structures , considered in refs.@xcite , is basically analogous to bragg scattering of matter waves in the framework of eq.(1 ) . in fact , the electric field amplitude @xmath21 of an optical wave at frequency @xmath22 that propagates along a dielectric medium with a spatially - dependent relative dielectric constant @xmath23 $ ] , where @xmath24 is the refractive index of the lossless medium and @xmath25 accounts for the index and gain / loss modulation , satisfies the scalar helmholtz equation , which can be written in the form @xmath26 where we have set @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "note that eq.(3 ) formally reduces to the schrdinger equation provided that the following formal substitutions @xmath29 are made , with a complex scattering potential @xmath3 related to the modulation of the dielectric constant @xmath30 by the simple relation @xmath31 hence , the only difference between scattering of matter waves in complex optical potentials and light waves in complex bragg gratings is that , in the latter case , the complex scattering potential @xmath32 in the equivalent schrdinger equation depends on the energy @xmath2 of the incidence particle .",
    "however , for shallow gratings bragg scattering occurs solely for optical fields with frequencies @xmath22 very close to the bragg frequency @xmath33 ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and thus one can safely assume @xmath34 , leaving out the dependence of the scattering potential from the energy . in the following , we will mainly focus our analysis to the determination of the reflection and transmission coefficients for scattering of matter waves in the framework of eq.(1 ) , however similar results hold _ mutatis mutandis _ for reflection and transmission of optical waves in bragg grating structures .      since @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 ,",
    "the continuous spectrum of the hamiltonian @xmath35 is the semi - infinite real axis of energies @xmath36 , and the corresponding eigenfunctions are the scattered states , defined by the relations @xmath37 \\ ; \\ ; x",

    "such amplitudes are related by the algebraic equation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath41 where the @xmath42 transfer matrix @xmath43 is unimodular , i.e. @xmath44 . for a @xmath0-symmetric potential , the further relation @xmath45 holds .",
    "the transmission ( @xmath46 ) and reflection ( @xmath47 ) coefficients for left ( @xmath48 ) and right ( @xmath47 ) side incidence are related to the coefficients of the transfer matrix by the usual relations ( see , for instance , @xcite ) @xmath49 note that the transmission coefficient does not depend on the incidence side like in an ordinary crystal , whereas generally one has @xmath50 , i.e. in reflection a complex crystal behaves differently for left and right incidence .",
    "this is a rather general result of wave scattering from a complex potential barrier which was previously discussed e.g. in @xcite .",
    "if we indicate by @xmath51 the fundamental matrix of eq.(1 ) from @xmath52 to @xmath53 which relates the values of @xmath54 and @xmath55 at the planes @xmath52 and @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 it can be readily shown that the transfer matrix @xmath58 can be calculated as @xmath59 where we have set @xmath60 from a numerical viewpoint , the fundamental matrix @xmath61 can be computed as follows .",
    "let us cut the crystal into a sequence of @xmath62 thin slices , of thickness @xmath63 , and let us indicate by @xmath64 the fundamental matrix associated to the propagation at the @xmath65-th slice ( @xmath66 ) , i.e. from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "then the fundamental matrix @xmath61 can be calculated as the ordered product @xmath69 if @xmath70 is much smaller than @xmath4 , the potential @xmath3 is almost constant in the interval @xmath71 , and thus @xmath64 can be approximated as @xmath72 where we have set @xmath73 note that , because of the periodicity of the crystal , one can limit to compute the fundamental matrix for the unit cell , @xmath74 , i.e. from @xmath52 to @xmath75 .",
    "the fundamental matrix of the crystal is then given by @xmath76 , which can be computed using the relation @xcite @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the @xmath79 identity matrix , @xmath80   / \\sin \\theta$ ] , and the complex angle @xmath81 is defined by @xmath82 .",
    "besides scattering states , the hamiltonian @xmath35 can possess bound states belonging to the point spectrum , which are determined by the zeros of @xmath83 ( i.e. the poles of the transmission coefficient @xmath46 ) in the half complex plane @xmath84 .",
    "the zeros of @xmath83 in the half complex plane @xmath85 are resonance states .",
    "the onset of @xmath0 symmetry breaking is detected by the appearance of a divergence ( for some real value @xmath86 of the momentum ) in the transmission coefficient as the non - hermiticity parameter @xmath87 is increased from zero .",
    "in fact , for @xmath88 the transmission and reflection coefficients are bounded from above and the zeros of @xmath83 lie in the lower half complex plane @xmath85 , i.e. they are resonances .",
    "as @xmath87 in increased , the resonances move toward the real axis @xmath89 , until at a critical value @xmath90 a resonance crosses the real axis , say at @xmath86 ( real ) .",
    "correspondingly , the transmission coefficient @xmath91 diverges at @xmath92 . just above @xmath93",
    ", a bound state with complex energy @xmath94 thus appears , which is the signature of @xmath0 symmetry breaking . for a sinusoidal crystal of _ finite _ length , the transmission and reflection coefficients at @xmath95",
    "are bounded , and numerical calculations of the transfer matrix @xmath58 ( using the procedure outlined above ) indicate that symmetry breaking is attained at a value @xmath93 _ larger _ than one , with @xmath96 as @xmath97 .      for a rather general class of @xmath0-symmetric complex potentials",

    "is generally referred to as the coupled - mode theory of bragg scattering , which is known to provide accurate description of transmission and reflection coefficients for index - modulated shallow gratings ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "such an analysis applies to bragg scattering of particles with momentum @xmath17 close to @xmath98 ( first - order bragg scattering ) provided that the particle energy @xmath99 is much larger than the characteristic modulation depth @xmath13 of the complex crystal . for the sinusoidal crystal defined by eq.(2 ) , this means that the parameter @xmath100 should be much smaller than one . in ref.@xcite",

    "such equations clearly indicate that , for left - side incidence , the crystal appears to be fully invisible , i.e. there are not reflected waves and the transmitted ones propagate as if the crystal were absent @xcite .",
    "conversely , for right - side incidence as the transmitted wave propagates again as if the crystal were absent , a reflected wave is generated , with a reflectance @xmath103 that grows quadratically with the crystal thickness @xmath6 at bragg resonance @xmath104 , i.e. for @xmath105 .",
    "such a physically relevant behavior was referred to as _",
    "unidirectional invisibility _ in ref.@xcite .",
    "as it is shown in the appendix a and briefly mentioned in ref.@xcite , in the framework of the coupled - mode theory unidirectional invisibility is predicted to occur for a rather general class of complex potentials with zero mean , @xmath106 , provided that the condition @xmath107 ( or similarly @xmath108 ) is satisfied .",
    "note that the @xmath0-symmetric sinusoidal potential ( 2 ) at @xmath95 belongs to such a general class of complex potentials .",
    "+ in the next section , we will derive _ exact _",
    "expressions for transmission and reflection coefficients for the @xmath0-symmetric sinusoidal crystal , and will show that the invisibility property of the crystal , as predicted by eq.(15 ) , occurs solely for short crystals , and breaks down for long crystals . here",
    "we discuss the reasons of failure of eq.(15 ) to predict the correct expressions of transmission and reflection coefficients in long crystals , and propose an _ extended _ version of coupled - mode theory to properly describe bragg scattering in complex crystals .",
    "the derivation of coupled - mode equations is routinely done by means of averaging or multiple - scale asymptotic techniques , which is detailed in the appendix a for the general case of a complex potential @xmath109 with zero mean .",
    "here we give explicit analytical results for the sinusoidal @xmath0-symmetric crystal at @xmath95 , however as shown in the appendix a similar results are obtained for a more general complex crystal provided that the condition @xmath107 is satisfied . for a small value of @xmath110 , a solution to eq.(1 ) can be searched as a power series expansion @xmath111 and multiple spatial scales @xmath112 , @xmath113 , ... are introduced to satisfy solvability conditions at the various orders in the asymptotic analysis .",
    "if the analysis is pushed up to the order @xmath114 , the solution to eq.(1 ) inside the crystal for a small value of @xmath102 ( of order @xmath115 ) can be written as @xmath116 where we have set @xmath117 and where the amplitudes @xmath118 and @xmath119 satisfy the coupled - mode equations @xmath120 from eqs.(20 ) and ( 21 ) , it follows that the amplitudes @xmath118 and @xmath119 at the planes @xmath52 and @xmath53 are related by the relation @xmath121 , where the matrix @xmath122 reads explicitly @xmath123 in standard coupled - mode theory @xcite , only the leading order term @xmath124 in the expansion ( 17 ) is considered for the computation of the transfer matrix @xmath58 , and one simply has @xmath125 where we have set @xmath126 using eq.(23 ) for the expression of the transfer matrix , one then obtains eq.(15 ) for the reflection and transmission coefficients",
    ". however , for a complex crystal such an analysis can fail even if the correction term @xmath127 , given by eq.(19 ) , remains smaller than @xmath128 . to understand why this may happen ,",
    "let us consider as an example the case of left - side incidence .",
    "this case requires the absence of incident waves from the right side , which formally implies @xmath129 at @xmath56 , where @xmath17 is the momentum of the incident wave from the left side .",
    "if the approximation @xmath130 is made , the appropriate boundary conditions would be @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",
    "the key point is that , if the expression ( 17 ) of @xmath54 up to the order @xmath114 is now considered , the boundary condition @xmath132 does not exactly correspond to the absence of incident waves from the right side , just because of the ( small ) additional contribution to @xmath54 given by @xmath133 [ eq.(19 ) ] .",
    "hence a more accurate procedure should use the boundary conditions @xmath131 and @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is a small parameter ( of order @xmath110 ) to be determined such that @xmath129 at @xmath56 .",
    "it is obvious that , if the solution to the coupled - mode equations ( 20 - 21 ) with the boundary conditions @xmath136 and",
    "@xmath137 ( corresponding to probing the crystal from the _ right _ side with a small amplitude @xmath135 ) would remain small uniformly in the interval @xmath138 , the additional contribution to the solution arising from taking @xmath139 would just introduce a small correction to the solution corresponding to the boundary conditions @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "hence a small correction to the transmission and reflection coefficients eq.(15 ) would be obtained .",
    "this case always occurs for short enough crystals .",
    "however , if the crystal length @xmath6 is long enough such that the reflection @xmath142 for right - side incidence becomes large ( of the order or larger than @xmath143 ) , then the correction arising from the solution to the coupled - mode equations ( 20 - 21 ) with the boundary conditions @xmath136 and @xmath137 can not be neglected anymore , and thus should be accounted for when calculating the reflection and transmission coefficients with the appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the crystal length @xmath6 at which failure of eq.(15 ) is expected to occur can be estimated by imposing @xmath144 . taking for @xmath145 its peak value at @xmath104 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath146 , one then expects failure of eq.(15 ) for @xmath147 , where @xmath148 hence , for @xmath6 of the order of larger than @xmath149 , eq.(15 ) can not be used to calculate the transmission and reflection coefficients of the crystal .",
    "a more appropriate procedure to compute the transfer matrix , and thus the transmission and reflection coefficients , is to use eq.(10 ) , in which the fundamental matrix @xmath150 is calculated using for @xmath54 the expression given by eqs.(17 - 19 ) , i.e. _ including _ the first - order correction term @xmath133 .",
    "such an extension of the ordinary coupled - mode theory will be referred to as the _ extended _ coupled - mode theory .",
    "exact expressions for the reflection and transmission coefficients can be derived for the sinusoidal potential ( 2 ) at @xmath95 in terms of modified bessel functions of firts kind .",
