    "noncommutative geometry provides a particularly elegant way to derive and describe the structure and the lagrangian of the standard model in curved spacetime and its coupling to gravitation  @xcite .",
    "the main ingredients of this approach are an algebra @xmath0 ( where @xmath1 is a riemann spin manifold and @xmath2),@xcite a hilbert space @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 is the spinor bundle and @xmath5 is 96-dimensional ) , and a dirac operator @xmath6 .",
    "the elements @xmath7 of the algebra are represented by bounded operators @xmath8 over @xmath9 . in this approach ,",
    "the gauge bosons are described by gauge potentials ( i.e. noncommutative one - forms ) in @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the differential graded algebra ( dga ) constructed from @xmath12 , whose differential is calculated by using the commutator with @xmath6 .    from the physical point of view , a striking success of the noncommutative geometric approach is that the algebra , the hilbert space and the dirac operator of the standard model can be derived from a few simple axioms , including the condition of order zero , the condition of order one and the condition of massless photon .",
    "@xcite then , the lagrangian of the standard model coupled to ( riemannian ) gravity is obtained by counting the eigenvalues of the dirac operator @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite    still , this approach is not completely physical because it is formulated in the riemannian ( instead of lorentzian ) signature and is not quantized .",
    "therefore , the original ncg approach was variously modified , by using lie algebras  @xcite , twisted spectral triples  @xcite or lie algebroids and derivation - based ncg,@xcite to deal with models that do not enter into the standard ncg framework ( e.g. quantum groups or grand symmetry).@xcite    however , to discover the mathematical framework most suitable for the physical standard model , it might also be useful to go the other way and find an approach where the standard model is still more constrained ( i.e. deduced from less axioms ) than in ncg .",
    "boyle and farnsworth@xcite recently used eilenberg s algebra extension method to build an algebra @xmath13 where the universal dga @xmath14 built on @xmath12 ( see section  [ ncdiform ] ) is extended by the hilbert space @xmath9 .",
    "this is physically more satisfactory because the gauge field , the field intensity , the curvature and the lagrangian densities are noncommutative differential forms , which belong to @xmath14 up to an ideal described below .",
    "they observed that the associativity of the algebra @xmath13 imposes a new condition ( of order two ) which is satisfied by the finite part @xmath15 of the standard model and removes a somewhat arbitrary axiom in chamseddine and connes derivation.@xcite this axiom requires the dirac operator @xmath16 of the finite algebra to commute with a specific family of elements of @xmath15 .",
    "it is called the condition of massless photon because it ensures that the photon has no mass .",
    "however , as noticed by boyle and farnsworth , this approach has two drawbacks : i ) it is not valid for a spin manifold ( i.e. the canonical spectral triple @xmath17 does not satisfy the condition of order two ) ; ( ii ) it uses the dga algebra @xmath14 in which gauge fields with vanishing representation ( i.e. @xmath18 such that @xmath19 ) can have non - zero field intensity ( i.e. @xmath20 ) .",
    "this makes the yang - mills action ill defined.@xcite a consistent substitute for @xmath14 is the space @xmath21 of noncommutative differential forms which is a dga built as the quotient of @xmath14 by a differential ideal @xmath22 usually called the _",
    "junk_.    to solve both problems , we define an extension @xmath13 of the physically meaningful algebra @xmath21 of noncommutative differential forms by a representation space @xmath23 that we build explicitly .",
    "since the algebra @xmath21 is a dga , we require the extension @xmath13 to be also a dga and we obtain that @xmath23 must be a differential graded bimodule over @xmath21 ( see below ) .",
    "the most conspicuous consequence of this construction is a modification of the condition of order two proposed by boyle and farnsworth , which provides exactly the same constraints on the finite part of the spectral triple of the standard model , but which is now consistent with the spectral triple of a spin manifold . as a consequence ,",
    "the full spectral triple of the standard model ( and not only its finite part ) now satisfies the condition of order two and enables us to remove the condition of massless photon .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe the extension of an algebra by a vector space , first proposed by eilenberg  @xcite and used by boyle and farnsworth .",
    "we discuss the modification required to take the differential graded structure into account .",
    "then , we describe the construction by connes and lott of noncommutative differential forms , we build a space @xmath23 that can be used to extend @xmath21 into a dga @xmath13 and we show that the spectral triple of the standard model fits into this framework if and only if the condition of massless photon is satisfied . finally , we add a fundamentaly symmetry that makes the model compatible with the lorentz signature of the spin manifold @xmath1 , thus reaching the fully physical standard model .",
    "the cohomology of lie algebras plays a crucial role in the modern understanding of classical  @xcite and quantum  @xcite gauge field theories .",
    "this cohomology theory mixes the gauge lie algebra and its representation over a vector or spinor bundle . shortly after the publication of the cohomology of lie algebras , eilenberg generalized this idea to the representation of any algebra",
