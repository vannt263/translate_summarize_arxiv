    "for the first time in the history of cosmology , the variety and quality of current cosmological data provide the possibility of testing some fundamental hypotheses of the standard cosmological model .",
    "one of these hypotheses is the validity of the so - called cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) , which is derived from etherington reciprocity theorem ( etherington , 1933 ) .",
    "the cddr , expressed as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath14 is the luminosity distance to a given source at redshift @xmath3 , holds if photons follow null ( unique ) geodesic and the geodesic deviation equation is valid , along with the assumption that the number of photons is conserved over the cosmic evolution ( bassett & kunz , 2004 ) .",
    "the cddr plays an essential role in observational cosmology and any departure from it could point to exciting new fundamental physics or unaccounted systematic errors ( for a general discussion , see ellis , 1971 ) .    in recent years , several authors have proposed methods to test the cddr . generally speaking , we can roughly divide them in two classes , cosmological model - dependent tests , usually performed within the cosmic concordance @xmath15cdm model , and model - independent ones .",
    "for instance , uzan et al .",
    "( 2005 ) showed that the combination of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sze ) plus x - ray observations , used to measure angular diameter distance to galaxy clusters , is dependent on the cddr validity . by using 18 measurements of @xmath13 to galaxy clusters described by a spherical model and the @xmath15cdm concordance model these authors showed",
    "that the cddr validity was only marginally verified .",
    "( 2010 ) and meng _ et al . _",
    "( 2012 ) , also using sze / x - ray observations of galaxy clusters , showed that triaxial ellipsoidal model is a better geometrical hypothesis describing the structure of the galaxy cluster compared with the spherical model if the cddr is valid in cosmological observations .",
    "( 2010 ; 2012 ) adopted a modified expression of the cddr , @xmath16 , to constrain , in the context of a flat @xmath15cdm model , the cosmic opacity from type ia supernova ( sne ia ) and @xmath17 data .",
    "they found @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) . in this line ,",
    "holanda & busti ( 2014 ) probed the cosmic opacity at high redshifts with gamma - ray bursts and @xmath17 data and showed that this combination of data is compatible with a transparent universe ( @xmath20 ) at @xmath21 level , regardless of the dark energy equation - of - state parameter @xmath22 assumed in the analysis .",
    "on the other hand , several cosmological model - independent tests for the cddr have also been proposed .",
    "de bernardis , giusarma & melchiorri ( 2006 ) , holanda _ et al . _",
    "( 2011 ) and li , wu & yu 2011 confronted @xmath13 measurements to galaxy clusters with sne ia data obtaining that the cddr is verified at 1@xmath10 when the galaxy clusters are described by ellipsoidal model . by showing that the x - ray gas mass fraction ( @xmath23 ) of galaxy clusters also depends on the cddr validity , gonalves",
    "( 2012 ) proposed a test involving samples of gas mass fractions and sne ia observations .",
    "another test using exclusively gas mass fractions was proposed by holanda _",
    "these authors showed that the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath25 observations is given by @xmath26 , where @xmath27 quantifies departures of the cddr validity .",
    "no violation was found .",
    "it was shown no violation of the cddr .",
    "santos - da - costa _ et al . _",
    "( 2015 ) , applying gaussian process , proposed a test based on galaxy clusters observations and @xmath17 measurements and no evidence of deviation of the cddr validity was found . by using measurements of the cosmic microwave background black - body spectrum , ellis _",
    "( 2013 ) showed that the reciprocity relation can not be violated by more than @xmath28 between decoupling and today .",
    "recently , liao _ et al . _",
    "( 2015 ) introduced a new method to test the cddr based on strong gravitational lensing systems ( cao et al .",
    "2015 ) and the most recent sne ia compilation ( betoule et al . 2014 ) .",
    "although most of the results so far have been consistent with the validity of the cddr , new methods with different astronomical observations and redshift range offer a path to validate the whole cosmological framework as well as to detect unexpected behaviour or systematic errors .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we propose a new test which uses the strong gravitational lensing effect and luminosity distances from type ia supernovae .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we describe our new method to test the cddr , while in section 3 the observational quantities used in this work are discussed .",
    "the corresponding constraints on the departures of the cddr are investigated and discussed in section 4 .",
    "we end this paper by summarizing our main results in section 5 .",
    "strong gravitational lensing ( sgl ) is a powerful astrophysical effect to probing both gravity theories and cosmology .",
    "it occurs whenever the source ( @xmath29 ) , the lens ( @xmath30 ) and the observer ( @xmath31 ) are so well aligned that the observer - source direction lies inside the so - called einstein radius of the lens ( for a complete discussion on this effect , see schneider , ehlers & falco , 1992 ) . in a cosmological context",
    "the source is usually a galaxy or quasar with a galaxy acting as the lens .",
    "recent papers have explored strong gravitational lensing systems for measuring cosmological parameters ( biesiada , malec , & piorkowska 2011 ; yuan & wang 2015 , cao et al .",
    "2015 ) .",
    "the einstein radius @xmath32 , under assumption of the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) model for the lens , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the speed of light , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the angular diameter distances between lens - source and source - observer , respectively , and @xmath37 is the velocity dispersion due to lens mass distribution.@xmath37 is not to be exactly equal to the observed stellar velocity dispersion @xmath38 , there is a strong indication that dark matter halos are dynamically hotter than the luminous stars based on x - ray observations . in order to account for this difference",
    "it is introduced a phenomenological free parameter @xmath39 , defined by the relation : @xmath40 , where @xmath41 ( ofek et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in our cddr test we are interested in the ratio between angular distances : @xmath42 if one assumes the cddr validity it is possible to transform the above expression into a luminosity distance ratio . for the angular diameter distance of the source @xmath29",
    "we have @xmath43 whereas the luminosity and angular distances between lens and source are linked by ( bartelmann & schneider , 2001 ) @xmath44 from the above expressions , one may show that @xmath45 where @xmath46 therefore , obtaining @xmath47 from observations , the expression ( [ razao ] ) can be modified to investigate the cddr validity . in order to obtain @xmath47",
    "it is necessary to know @xmath48 at the same redshift of source in the lensing system and @xmath49 , the luminosity distance between lens and source .          in our work @xmath50",
    "is obtained as follows : we first estimate the luminosity distance @xmath51 for each sne ia of the sample by using their distance modulus measurements .",
    "the relation between the distance modulus @xmath52 and the luminosity distance is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the absolute magnitude of the source and @xmath55 is the apparent magnitude ( @xmath56 is for the @xmath56-band ) .",
    "it is important to stress that the distance moduli were obtained fitting some sne ia light - curve parameters in a flat @xmath15cdm model , which makes them model dependent .",
    "however , this dependence is much smaller than the errors coming from the gravitational lensing modelling , so it does not affect our results strongly .",
    "applying the transformation from distance modulus to luminosity distance , we perform a polynomial fit to @xmath51 of the sne i data ( see fig .",
    "( 1a ) and the discussion in the next section ) .",
    "thus , we can calculate @xmath50 at each point of interest ( source in the lensing system ) .",
    "previous papers used pairs of sne ia with some other astronomical object whose the redshifts difference between them were smaller than @xmath57 .",
    "the advantage of using polynomial fit on the sne ia data is to avoid any redshift difference as well as to minimize the bias from the objects in the same redshift but in different direction on the sky .    the distance @xmath49 , the luminosity distance between lens and source , is obtained by using two cosmological models : flat @xmath15cdm concordance model from the planck collaboration ( ade et al .",
    "2015 ) and flat @xmath58cdm from wmap9 satellite results ( hinshaw et al .",
    "the @xmath49 expressions for these models are @xmath59 where @xmath60 for @xmath15cdm model is @xmath61 and for @xmath58cdm is @xmath62 where the dark energy equation - of - state parameter is assumed to be given by @xmath63 .    combining temperature and lensing data",
    ", the planck collaboration found , for a flat @xmath15cdm universe , @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath66 .",
    "for a flat @xmath58cdm model , we use the following values to parameters at 1@xmath10 obtained from wmap 9 years ( hinshaw et al .",
    "2013 ) : @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in fig .",
    "( 1b ) we plot @xmath71 and @xmath47 using the gravitational lensing and sne ia data . for simplicity",
    ", we only show these quantities for the @xmath15cdm scenario .",
    "recently , the supernova cosmology project reported the discovery of the most distant sne ia ( rubinet al . 2013 ) : the sne ia scp-0401 at @xmath72 and distance modulus of @xmath73 ( statistical errors ) . in our analysis we added this sne ia to union 2.1 sample ( suzuki et al . 2012 ) , comprising 581 data points .",
    "the curves shown in fig .",
    "1a stand for the polynomial fit of @xmath74 points from sne ia data and the corresponding 1@xmath10 error .",
    "the open circle corresponds to the most distant ( @xmath75 ) spectroscopically confirmed sne ia .",
    "we also use 95 data points from 118 sgl systems from sloan lens acs survey ( slacs ) , boss emission - line lens survey ( bells ) , lenses structure and dynamics survey ( lsd ) and strong legacy survey sl2s surveys ( cao et al .",
    "we discarded systems with sources redshifts higher than @xmath76 .",
    "it is important to stress that cao et al .",
    "( 2015 ) assumed a spherically symmetric mass distribution in lensing galaxies , but relaxed the rigid assumption of sis model in favor of more general power - law index @xmath77 ( plaw ) , @xmath78 , where the distribution becomes a sis for @xmath79 . under this assumption",
    "the einstein radius is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the stellar velocity dispersion inside the aperture of size @xmath82 and @xmath83 ^ 2.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath84 the sample used here is compiled and summarized in table 1 of cao et al .",

    "in this work we assume the following general expressions : @xmath85 ( linear parametrization ) and @xmath86 ( non - linear parametrization ) , which avoids divergences at high-@xmath3 .",
    "the constraints to the @xmath87 parameter are derived by evaluating the likelihood distribution function , @xmath88 , with @xmath89 ^ 2}{\\sigma^2 }                                                                 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the observed @xmath91 ratio and @xmath92 stands for the statistical errors associated to sne ia , gravitational lensing obtained using standard propagation errors techniques . for the gravitational lensing error",
    "one may show that @xmath93 in order to explore the influence of the model used to describe the lens we perform our analysis by using the eqs .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 13 ) where the following flat priors on @xmath39 and @xmath94 were used : @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the results of our statistical analysis are shown in figs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .    in figs . ( 2a ) and ( 2b ) we plot the results for the linear parametrization .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 describing possible departures from the cddr is constrained in the regions : @xmath97 and @xmath98 for @xmath15cdm model using sis and plaw sgl models , respectively . for @xmath58cdm model",
    "we obtain : @xmath99 and @xmath100 using the sis and plaw models , respectively .    in figs .",
    "( 3a ) and ( 3b ) we plot the results for the non - linear parametrization .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 is constrained in the regions : @xmath101 and @xmath102 for @xmath15cdm model using sis and plaw sgl models , respectively . for @xmath58cdm model",
    "we obtain : @xmath103 and @xmath104 using the sis and plaw models , respectively . as on",
    "may see , the validity of the cddr is fully compatible with the data regardless the @xmath105 parametrization or cosmological model adopted in the analysis .",
    "finally , in table i we show an extensive list of current bounds on a possible departure from the cddr obtained from different techniques .",
    "it is worth observing that the validity of the cddr is verified at 2@xmath10 in all cases .",
    "although the uncertainties in our analysis are larger than previous works , given the large scatter of distance measurements in the lensing observations , the advantage of using these systems are the few astrophysical assumptions and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the cosmic distance - duality relation ( cddr ) , which relates in a simple way the luminosity and the angular diameter distances at a given redshift @xmath3 , plays an essential role in observational cosmology .",
    "its validity has a direct impact on several cosmological probes , from gravitational lensing studies to the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background and galaxy clusters observations .",
    "any source of attenuation , such as gray intergalactic dust or exotic photon interaction , contributes to violate the cddr since its proof is based on the conservation of the average number of photons . on the other hand , deviations from the cddr",
    "can also indicate that light does not propagate on null geodesics or that a metric theory for gravitation is inadequate .",
    "therefore , given the importance of the underlying hypotheses which hold the cddr , tests of the cddr are an important task for cosmology .    in this paper we have discussed a new test of the cddr in terms of the ratio of angular diameter ( @xmath106 ) and luminosity ( @xmath5 ) distances , where the subscripts 1 and 2 correspond to redshift @xmath6 and @xmath7 . by allowing departures of the cddr we have proposed @xmath107 , where @xmath108 , and placed constraints on @xmath87 by using strong gravitational lensing and type ia supernovae data .",
    "more specifically , we used 95 @xmath71 measurements from various gravitational lens and @xmath47 from 581 sne ia ( union 2.1 sample plus the most distant sne ia to date , i.e. , the scp-040 at @xmath72 ) .",
    "we have explored the influence of the model used to describe the lens by performing the fits under the assumption of the singular isothermal sphere and singular isothermal sphere with the general power - law index @xmath94 .",
    "we have obtained no violation of the cddr .",
    "the results derived here show an excellent agreement with those originated from very different astrophysical environments ( see table i ) and reinforce the theoretical pillars of the cddr .",
