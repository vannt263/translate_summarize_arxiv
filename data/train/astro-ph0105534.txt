    ", the pdf simply retains its gaussian shape , with the variance scaling up as the square of the growth factor . in the nonlinear regime , however , @xmath14 $ ] diverges away from its ( presumably gaussian ) initial shape .",
    "a number of recent studies have been undertaken to predict analytically the evolution of the pdf .",
    "kofman et al .",
    "( 1994 ) calculated the pdf produced by the zeldovich approximation . given a formalism to calculate the cumulants of the evolved distribution ( peebles 1980 ; fry 1984 ; bernardeau 1992a , hereafter b92 ) , the edgeworth expansion can be employed to derive an approximate expression for the pdf ( juszkiewicz et al .",
    "1995 , bernardeau & kofman 1995 ) .",
    "a better alternative is to derive a similar expansion around the gamma pdf ( gaztaaga , fosalba & elizalde 2000 ) . unlike the edgeworth expansion ,",
    "the gamma expansion always yields positive densities . the generating function for these cumulants",
    "can be used to derive the fourier transform of the pdf , which can be inverted to give the pdf in the form of an integral ( bernardeau 1994 ) .",
    "alternatively , this generating function can be transformed into a local lagrangian mapping which , when applied to the initial gaussian density field , gives a pdf with the desired tree - level hierarchical amplitudes ( protogeros & scherrer 1997 , hereafter ps ; protogeros , melott , & scherrer 1997 ) .",
    "fosalba and gaztaaga ( 1998a , hereafter fg ) showed that when shear is neglected , the equations of motion automatically produce a local lagrangian mapping which exactly reproduces the tree - level hierarchical amplitudes ( also fosalba and gaztaaga 1998b , gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 ) .",
    "it is this approach , neglecting shear in the cosmological equations of motion , which we will utilize here .",
    "fosalba & gaztaaga dubbed their approximation the  spherical collapse \" ( sc ) approximation ; although we adopt their terminology , it would perhaps be more accurate to refer to this approximation as  shear - free collapse \" .",
    "the sc model has also been used to model the pdf of qso ly-@xmath16 absorbers ( gaztaaga & croft 1999 ) .    of course , the three - dimensional distribution of galaxies is observed in redshift space rather than real space , with the radial coordinate distorted by the peculiar velocities of the galaxies .",
    "hence , the most physically relevant quantity is not the pdf in real space , but the redshift - space pdf . while the evolution of the hierarchical amplitudes in redshift space has been examined in some detail ( bouchet et al .",
    "1995 ; hivon et al .",
    "1995 ; scoccimarro et al .",

    "1 assumes that the bias parameter is unity .",
    "we make this assumption throughout , although bias can be incorporated into our formalism if the form of the bias is prescribed ) .",

    "the most detailed treatments thus far have been given by hui , kofman , and shandarin ( 2000 ) , who calculated the redshift - space pdf in the context of the zeldovich approximation , and by watts and taylor ( 2000 ) who calculated the redshift - space pdf in second - order perturbation theory .    in the next section ,",
    "we derive the local lagrangian mapping corresponding to the sc model , and apply it to gaussian initial conditions to derive the real - space density distribution function . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive an approximation to the redshift distortion of the density field based on the sc approximation .",
    "we calculate the corresponding redshift - space hierarchical moments and the redshift - space pdf in the sc approximation and compare the pdf to numerical simulations in redshift space .",

    "these two effects seem to cancel each other so that the values of the dimensionless skewness @xmath151 and kurtosis @xmath168 in real and redshift space are quite similar .",
    "this suggests some additional cancellation of the redshift distortions which is not accounted for by the sc model , most likely due to nonlinear effects .",
    "because of the potential significance of this result , we have repeated this calculation for a flat @xmath12cdm model with @xmath175 ( while this value for @xmath176 is somewhat larger than that suggested by recent observations , this model and the scdm model should serve to bracket the likely effect of redshift distortions ) .",
    "our results are displayed in fig .",
    "again , we see that , to a good approximation , @xmath169 d(\\delta/\\sigma)$ ] is identical in real and redshift space .",
    "the agreement here is even better than for the scdm model ; the two distributions are nearly identical for @xmath10 as large as 0.8 .",
    "the spherical collapse ( sc ) approximation for the pdf can provide good agreement with both the real - space and redshift - space pdf from numerical scdm simulations , but it fails at a much smaller value of @xmath4 in the latter case . in real space , we get good agreement with the numerical results for @xmath3 , while in redshift space , good agreement can be obtained only for @xmath5 .",
    "this is most likely due to nonlinear effects in the redshift - space pdf .",
    "an interesting advantage of the sc approach to derive the pdf is the possibility of extending the results to the case of non - gaussian initial conditions ( see also gaztaaga & fosalba 1998 , gaztaaga & croft 1999 ) .",
    "we only need to replace @xmath61 in equation ( [ pdf1 ] ) by the corresponding non - gaussian initial pdf .",
    "we also find an unexpected result in our simulations : the redshift space pdf , @xmath177 $ ] , is , to a good approximation , a simple rescaling of the real space pdf , @xmath141 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath169 d[\\delta/\\sigma ] = p\\left[\\delta_{(z)}/\\sigma_{(z)}\\right ] d\\left[\\delta_{(z)}/\\sigma_{(z)}\\right]$ ] .",
    "this rescaling provides an excellent approximation to the redshift - space pdf for @xmath178 in both the scdm and @xmath12cdm models .",
    "we have not found an entirely satisfactory explanation for this .",
    "while it would be an obvious result from linear theory , its validity extends well beyond the linear regime .",
    "for example , this rescaling applies very well to the regime for which @xmath141 $ ] is highly non - gaussian and the kaiser prediction for @xmath11 from linear theory ( eq . [ kaiser ] ) breaks down .",
    "this result seems to stem from a cancellation between the linear effect given by eq .",
    "( [ redshift ] ) and the nonlinear redshift distortions .",
    "it is perhaps ironic that this simple - minded rescaling gives a much better prediction for the redshift - space pdf than our sophisticated perturbation - theory approximation .",
