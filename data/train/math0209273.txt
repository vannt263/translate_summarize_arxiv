    "the cores of the handles ( viewed in surgered @xmath25 ) are capped off with the disks bounded by @xmath20 , @xmath21 in @xmath15 , slightly pushed out of the ball @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath26    this gives two spheres @xmath27 , @xmath28 , transverse to @xmath3 , @xmath6 respectively . they are embedded , but intersect in a single point , figure [ cobord ] . the strategy for using them in @xcite is the following .",
    "consider the clifford linking tori , one for each pair of `` extra '' double points of @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "these tori are geometrically dual to the whitney disks for @xmath29 , and they have caps provided by @xmath30 .",
    "when @xmath31 is assumed to be @xmath8-null in @xmath5 , the resulting capped surfaces are used embedded whitney disks , thus solving the embedding problem for @xmath29 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the cores of the @xmath4-handles attached to @xmath5 may be capped off by disks parallel to @xmath32 , which are now embedded .",
    "the resulting embedded @xmath4-spheres intersect the respective co - cores in a single point , and are used to attach @xmath33-handles .",
    "the union of @xmath22 and @xmath4- and @xmath33-handles is an @xmath1-cobordism since the boundary map computing the relative homology with @xmath34-coefficients is given by the identity matrix .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for the definition and basic properties of capped gropes . the ( iterated ) splitting operation from @xcite will be used later in the paper , and is briefly reviewed in this section .",
    "a disk - like grope is _ dyadic _ if all component surfaces are either disks or punctured tori .",
    "this means each non - cap surface has exactly one pair of dual subgropes attached to it .",
    "a grope has _ dyadic branches _ if all of the subgropes above the base level are dyadic .    in a grope with dyadic branches ,",
    "the caps are in one - to - one correspondence with the _ dyadic labels _ : for each dual pair of surfaces in the grope , label one by @xmath35 and the other by @xmath7 .",
    "a cap gets a label by reading off the sequence of @xmath35s or @xmath7s encountered in a path going from the base surface to the cap .",
    "the splitting operation splits a surface into two pieces , at the cost of doubling the dual subgrope .",
    "it can be used to decompose branches into dyadic branches , and can separate intersection points distinguished by properties unaffected by the dual doubling . in particular , it is used to separate double points that have different dyadic labels , or that represent different group elements in @xmath36 .",
    "suppose @xmath3 is a component surface of a grope , not part of the base .",
    "let @xmath6 be the surface it is attached to , and @xmath16 the dual subgrope",
    ". now suppose @xmath37 is an embedded arc on @xmath3 , with endpoints on the boundary , and disjoint from attaching circles of higher stages . in the 3-dimensional model , sum @xmath6 with itself by a tube about @xmath37 ( the normal @xmath38 bundle ) , and discard the part of @xmath3 that lies inside the tube .",
    "this splits @xmath3 into two components .",
    "@xmath16 is a dual for one component ; obtain a dual for the other by taking a parallel copy of @xmath16 .",
    "the following lemma is proved by an inductive application of this idea , descending from the caps downward to the first stage surface .",

    "all caps intersecting the given one have the same label ; and 3 .",
    "the fundamental group classes of the loops through the intersection points are the same .",
    "further , the subset of @xmath39 occuring as double point loops is the same as that of the original grope .",
    "we will need an iterated version of this lemma , where the intersections are uniformized to distance @xmath40 .",
    "this is made precise by the notion of an @xmath40-_type_. we refer to @xcite for the formal definition of an @xmath40-type , and of a _ collision _ at distance @xmath40 .",

    "there are no collisions at distance @xmath41 .    given an integer @xmath40 and a capped grope , its splitting to distance @xmath40 ( outcome of lemma [ n splitting ] )",
    "has the following algebraic - combinatorial description .",
    "consider any cap of the split grope .",
    "its intersections going out through chains of @xmath40 branches are encoded by a tree , whose valence equals the class of the grope , and whose edges are labelled by a finite collection of group elements represented by the intersections of the original grope .",
    "the paths in this tree are mimicked by geometric moves on the caps : the resulting double point loop represents the group element equal to the product of the labels along the path in the tree .",
    "however , this combinatorial graph is not , in general , mirrored geometrically as a tree of gropes , due to the existence of cycles .",
    "this is the subject of section [ cycles ] .",
    "this is a preliminary step showing that there is an analogue of splitting of capped surfaces ( lemma [ just splitting ] above ) for transverse pairs of spheres , up to @xmath1-cobordism .",
    "the @xmath1-cobordism is completed when eventually the immersed spheres are homotoped to embeddings .",
    "an extension to transverse pairs with higher whitney disk data is discussed in section [ splitting towers ] .",
    "let @xmath29 be a framed transverse pair in @xmath42 , and suppose @xmath3 has two intersection points @xmath43 , @xmath44 that need to be separated .",
    "consider two parallel copies @xmath18 , @xmath45 of @xmath6 , and let @xmath46 be the distinguished intersections between @xmath18 and @xmath3 , and between @xmath45 and @xmath3 , respectively .",

    "attach a @xmath4-handle to @xmath51 along @xmath52 , thus surgering the @xmath0-manifold along the curve @xmath37 .",
    "now both disks @xmath47 , @xmath48 are capped with copies of the core of the attached handle , giving immersed spheres @xmath17 , @xmath53 .",
    "this is similar to the argument in section 6.3 of @xcite , which converts a disk - embedding problem into a sphere problem .",
    "@xmath54    this creates two transverse pairs @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where @xmath17 and @xmath53 each inherits one of the intersections @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",

    "if one of the spheres @xmath17 , @xmath53 is homotopic to an embedding , then we will attach to it a @xmath33-handle , which together with the @xmath4-handle attached earlier yields an @xmath1-cobordism . to complete this @xmath1-cobordism , and also to solve the original surgery problem , one needs to work with both pairs of transverse spheres @xmath55 , @xmath56 .    as in lemma",
    "[ n splitting ] , given any @xmath58 , there is an iterated splitting of @xmath59 so that each sphere has an @xmath40-type , and there are no collisions at distance @xmath41 .",
    "this is the analogue of splitting of capped surfaces .",
    "here we show that there is an extension of the arguments above from transverse pairs of spheres ( dually : capped surfaces ) to transverse pairs together with layers of whitney disks ( dually : capped gropes ) .",
    "let @xmath12 be a transverse pair with algebraically trivial intersections , so all extra intersection points are paired up by whitney disks .",
    "given @xmath60 , it may be arranged that : there are @xmath61 layers of whitney disks for the intersections of the spheres , and for each @xmath62 the interiors of whitney disks at height @xmath63 are disjoint from all surfaces below that height ( i.e. we have a transverse pair of whitney towers of height @xmath61 . ) this may be done , for example , by converting @xmath59 into a transverse pair of capped gropes of height @xmath61 , and then contracting some of the surface stages .     @xmath64    the splitting of transverse pairs described in section [ splitting spheres ] will be applied to _",
    "pairs _ of intersections , rather than individual intersections .",
    "thus at all times the intersections will stay paired up , and whenever a parallel copy of a surface ( sphere or whitney disk ) is taken , it acquires also a parallel copy of the whole corresponding higher whitney data .",
    "the remaining ingredient is the splitting of whitney disks .",
    "suppose two intersections of some surfaces @xmath20 , @xmath21 are paired up with a whitney disk @xmath65 , and the interior of @xmath65 contains two collections @xmath43 , @xmath44 of points that need to be separated .",
    "consider a curve @xmath37 in @xmath65 with one endpoint in @xmath20 and the other one in @xmath21 , separating @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "perform a finger move on one of the surfaces , say @xmath20 , along @xmath37 , so that two new @xmath20 ",
    "@xmath21 intersections are created .",
    "the disk @xmath65 is replaced by two whitney disks , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , containing @xmath43 , @xmath44 respectively .",
    "this pushes the splitting problem to a lower stage .",
    "whitney towers are split , using an inductive application of this step together with the splitting of spheres described in section [ splitting spheres ] .",
    "before introducing the general construction for capped gropes in section [ grope scobordism ] , we illustrate the problem , and our approach to it , in the setting of transverse pairs of spheres .",
    "start with a transverse pair of spheres with algebraically trivial intersections , and split it to distance @xmath40 . in this setup",
    ", the splitting of transverse pairs described above will be applied to _",
    "pairs _ of intersections , rather than individual intersections .",
    "thus at all times the intersections will stay paired up , and whenever a parallel copy of a sphere is taken , its intersections acquire also a parallel copy of the corresponding whitney disks .",
    "@xmath68    perform the @xmath1-cobordism construction ( attach a pair of @xmath4-handles ) in a neighborhood of the distinguished intersection point of each transverse pair of spheres , as described in section [ construction ] .",
    "now each whitney disk has a dual capped torus .",
    "we are going to focus on this collection @xmath69 of capped tori , in the complement of the original spheres .",
    "algebraically we have a line , subdivided into intervals labelled by group elements , encoding the intersections of the spheres , as in @xcite .",
    "( note that this line also encodes , algebraically , the intersections among the @xmath69 . )",
    "one can not assume however that this picture holds geometrically as well , i.e. that there is a different capped torus for each vertex of the line .",
    "this is because of the presence of cycles . by definition ,",
    "a _ cycle _ is a path , embedded in the graph ( in this context , in the line ) whose endpoints correspond to the same capped torus .",
    "for example , suppose two spheres @xmath3 , @xmath6 forming a transverse pair intersect each other , as in figure [ cycle ] , and let @xmath70 be the group element corresponding to the intersections .",
    "no splitting is necessary : both spheres have an @xmath40-type for each @xmath40 , and the corresponding graph is a line , with each edge labelled by the same group element @xmath71 .",
    "however , there is no line of tori geometrically : the caps of the dual capped torus intersect each other , this is a cycle of length @xmath7 .",
    "the following construction is used to unravel cycles , without changing the uniform algebraic pattern of intersections . before considering the general problem , here",
    "is the description for the cycle in figure [ cycle ] .",
    "consider @xmath40 copies of one of the spheres , say @xmath6 , denote them @xmath72 .",
    "now there are @xmath40 whitney disks , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and let @xmath75 denote the corresponding clifford torus , dual to @xmath73 .",
    "@xmath76    perform the construction of section [ construction ] ( attach a pair of @xmath4-handles ) in a neighborhood of the distinguished interesection point of each pair @xmath77 , @xmath74 .",
    "if all spheres @xmath78 are eventually shown to be homotopic to embedding , their parallel copies will be used as attaching maps for @xmath33-handles .",
    "these , together with the @xmath4-handles attached earlier , form an @xmath1-cobordism , since the boundary map @xmath79 is given by an upper triangular matrix .",
    "continue the construction of the capped tori : there is a unique choice for the cap of @xmath80 , intersecting @xmath81 : it has to go over the dual sphere to @xmath81 , provided by the corresponding @xmath4-handle .",
    "there are , however , @xmath40 choices for the other cap of each @xmath80 , intersecting @xmath3 .",
    "we pick a cyclic shift , and it is this choice that is at the core of the construction . for",
    "each @xmath82 let the cap of @xmath80 go over the @xmath4-sphere , dual to @xmath3 near the intersection with @xmath83 , and finally the cap of @xmath84 goes over the sphere dual to @xmath3 near the intersection with @xmath85 .",
    "all caps are disjoint from each other , except for the unavoidable intersections that are inherited from the dual spheres in the @xmath1-cobordism construction .",
    "figure [ unravel ] illustrates the case @xmath86 .    the outcome is a cyclic chain of capped surfaces @xmath87 , with the caps of @xmath80 intersecting @xmath88 and @xmath89  the @xmath40-cyclic cover of the capped torus in figure [ cycle ]",
    "this is a geometric realization , with injectivity radius @xmath90 , of the algebraic graph encoding the intersections of the spheres .",
    "we now continue the construction in the general case , for an arbitrary transverse pair of spheres , split to distance @xmath40 .",
    "the solution here is going to be an implant of a segment of length @xmath40 of the universal cover of figure [ unravel ] . more precisely ,",
    "pick one of the transverse pairs , @xmath91 , and look at the algebraic graph of intersections up to radius @xmath40 .",
    "it corresponds to a sequence of pairs of spheres , @xmath92 ( actually , multiple parallel copies due to splitting ) .",
    "we assign the labels @xmath93 to the spheres respecting their linear order .",
    "the edges of the graph correspond to the intersections between @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "moreover , some of the pairs coincide ( precisely in the presence of cycles . )",
    "@xmath96    recall that just like in the capped surface case , the spheres in a pair are assigned dyadic labels .",
    "the notation may be misleading , as @xmath3 , @xmath6 do not correspond to such labels : @xmath97 , @xmath98 may have the same dyadic label .",
    "replace @xmath97 with @xmath40 copies : @xmath99 .",
    "since @xmath97 may occur elsewhere in the chain , say @xmath100 for some @xmath63 , all such @xmath94 are replaced with @xmath40 copies as well .",
    "note that @xmath94 can never coincide with @xmath101 for any @xmath63 , @xmath102 , as this would imply a collision at distance @xmath103 , and would contradict the splitting assumption .",
    "if @xmath104 has not been affected , replace it with @xmath40 copies .",
    "continue this procedure until each @xmath105 is replaced with @xmath40 copies .",
    "now we have a segment of the infinite cyclic cover of figure [ unravel ] , and we follow the same construction as in that example : assign caps to the capped tori with a cyclic shift .",
    "the claim is that the result is a sequence of length @xmath40 of capped tori , _ without cycles _ , exactly mimicing the algebraic line of intersections of the spheres .",
    "if there were no cycles to begin with , our construction just replicates the chain of capped surfaces , without altering the algebraic intersections .",
    "if there were cycles , they are eliminated .",
    "this is the analogue of the @xmath1-cobordism construction for transverse pairs of spheres ( desrcibed in section [ construction ] . )",
    "the new feature of the construction for capped gropes is that it can be applied at every surface stage . at the end of this section",
    "we give the proof of theorem [ geometric tree ] .",
    "recall that every surface ( including the caps ) , above the first stage , in a capped grope has a transverse grope .",
    "it is constructed using two copies of the dual surface , cf section 1.4 in @xcite . to fix notations , suppose @xmath106 is a surface in a capped grope , and let @xmath3 , @xmath6 be surfaces attached to a symplectic pair of circles @xmath107 in @xmath106 .",
    "then the transverse capped grope @xmath108 for @xmath3 is built of two parallel copies of @xmath6 ( and everything attached to @xmath6 ) , and analogously the transverse grope @xmath109 for @xmath6 is made of two copies for @xmath3 .",
    "the transverse gropes @xmath110 are used to resolve intersections of surfaces with @xmath3 and @xmath6 ( and with other surface stages and caps attached to @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) respectively .    the base surfaces",
    "@xmath111 , @xmath112 of @xmath108 , @xmath109 intersect in two points near the intersection point @xmath113 of the circles @xmath107 in @xmath106 .",
    "consider a @xmath0-ball @xmath13 around the intersection point @xmath113 in @xmath106 .",
    "the ball @xmath13 is chosen so that @xmath114 and @xmath115 are disks , and @xmath13 contains the two intersection points @xmath116 . consider the circles @xmath117 , @xmath118 of intersection of @xmath111 , @xmath112 with @xmath15 .",
    "as in the construction of section [ construction ] , attach two @xmath4-handles to @xmath22 along @xmath119 , @xmath120 .",
    "the cores of the @xmath4-handles ( viewed in the surgered @xmath0-manifold ) are capped with the disks @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "the result is a pair of spheres , geometrically dual to the surfaces @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "each of these two spheres is embedded , but they intersect in two points .    consequently , the spheres may be used to resolve intersections with @xmath3 , @xmath6 and with other surfaces attached to @xmath3 , @xmath6 , but the price is the presence of new intersections between the surfaces pushed off @xmath3 and @xmath6 .",
    "these spheres are useful for finding embedded caps for the grope .",
    "the crucial observation is that once the caps of the grope are improved to embeddings , then the @xmath33-handles can be attached to complete the @xmath1-cobordism .",
    "the attaching @xmath4-spheres are constructed as follows : a parallel copy of the core of each @xmath4-handle is capped off by an embedded disk built of two parallel copies of the dual capped grope ( an embedded disk may be found now , since the caps are assumed to be embedded . ) attaching the @xmath33-handles completes the construction of an @xmath1-cobordism , since the boundary map @xmath123 computing the relative homology with @xmath34-coefficients is the identity matrix .",
    "we conclude with the proof of theorem [ geometric tree ] . starting with a transverse pair of spheres ,",
    "convert one of them into a capped grope ",
    "a capped grope of height @xmath4 suffices , and we assume for simplicity that this is the case . let @xmath40 be a positive integer .",
    "split the grope to the distance @xmath40 ( lemma [ n splitting ] . )",
    "fix a cap @xmath124 of the split grope ; as explained in section [ grope splitting ] , the intersections among the caps of the split grope are encoded algebraically by a tree @xmath125 , up to the distance @xmath40 from @xmath124 .",
    "the goal is to convert this into a geometric picture where the capped gropes correspond to the vertices of the tree , and the intersections between their caps are encoded by the edges .",
    "consider all genus @xmath7 pieces of the base surface ( branches ) that appear in the tree @xmath125 .",
    "the gropes have two surface stages and caps .",
    "the split grope has dyadic branches ; fix a genus one piece of the base surface .",
    "it branches into two second stage surfaces , and then into four caps .",
    "adapting to the setting of gropes the cyclic construction of section [ cycles ] , consider @xmath40 parallel copies of one of the second stage surfaces , and then @xmath40 parallel copies of one in each dual pair of caps .",
    "the @xmath1-cobordism construction described above will be applied at each intersection point of the attaching circles of all surfaces ( second stage surfaces and caps ) present in the picture .",
    "this is the model that will be applied at each branch of the split capped grope .",
    "finally , the construction for resolving cycles in section [ cycles ] is generalized from the the context of transverse pairs of spheres ( intersections encoded by a line ) to capped gropes ( intersections encoded by a tree . )",
    "the intersections between the caps are pushed down and off the grope using the transverse spheres provided by the @xmath1-cobordism construction .",
    "this is done with cyclic shift with respect to the numbering of the parallel copies of the caps , and of the dual spheres .",
    "the stage , to which the intersection is pushed down to , is determined based on the dyadic labels of the caps .",
    "the proof that the cycles are resolved is analogous to the sphere case , in section [ cycles ] ."
