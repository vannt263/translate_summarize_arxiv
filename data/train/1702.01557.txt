    "the existence of a pair of observables which is not jointly measurable is one of the most important properties of the quantum theory .",
    "it is , however , known that this peculiar property is not specific to the quantum theory in a general framework called generalized probability theories ( gpts)@xcite .",
    "this framework focuses on the operational aspect of probability theories and is broad enough to include both the classical and quantum theories . according to a recent result obtained by @xcite ,",
    "a gpt is the classical theory if and only if every pair of observables is jointly measurable .    for a given gpt ,",
    "it is interesting to study its closeness to the classical theory ( and the quantum theory ) . for this purpose",
    "jointly measurable pairs of observables may play important role .",
    "unfortunately , the problem to find any necessary and sufficient conditions for a pair of observables to be jointly measurable seems to be an intractably hard problem even in the quantum theory .",
    "an important partial result was given by busch @xcite in 1986 .",
    "in this paper he treated the so - called unbiased binary observables whose povm element ( effect ) is traceless ( i.e. , unbiased effect ) on a qubit and obtained a simple necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of such observables to be jointly measurable .    in this paper , we study gpts which have a certain symmetry .",
    "the symmetry allows us to introduce a natural generalization of the unbiased binary observable . as we study only binary observables , the notion of jointly measurable observables coincide with that of coexistent effects .",
    "the gpts we treat has even - sided regular polygon theories ( gpts specified by regular polygon state spaces ) as its main examples .",
    "we first study the even - sided regular polygon theories and show that the corresponding effect space has a nice symmetry which allows the existence of a hyperplane so that this plane has all the extreme effects except for trivial ones ( zero and unit ) and divides the whole effect space into two subsets which are related to each other by reflection symmetry .",
    "we call such a hyperplane a _ reflecting hyperplane_. we generalize the notion of unbiased effects to a gpt with a reflecting hyperplane .",
    "we obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a pair of unbiased effects of even - sided regular polygon theories to be coexistent .",
    "furthermore , we show that an effect space has such a reflecting hyperplane if and only if its corresponding state space has the point symmetry .",
    "we examine general systems ( other than regular polygons ) which have the reflecting hyperplane and show that the volume of the set of all effects coexistent with a nontrivial extreme effect is vanishing .",
    "the gpts provide a general framework for description of probabilistic physical experiments .",
    "we prepare a measured object and perform a measurement to obtain an outcome . a preparation of a measured object",
    "is called a _",
    "state_. once a state is fixed , a measurement process assigns a probability to each possible outcome .",
    "this probability assigning map whose range is @xmath0 $ ] is called an _ effect_. as an experiment is determined by possible classes of preparation and measurements , a gpt is specified by a state space @xmath1 and an effect space @xmath2 .    any statistical ensemble of states is also a state in quantum mechanics .",
    "this property is applied also to gpts .",
    "that is , if we have two states @xmath3 then @xmath4 ( for @xmath5 ) is also a state .",
    "since this @xmath6 is interpreted as a statistical mixture of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , this implies @xmath9 for all effects @xmath10 .",
    "the effect space is also closed under the statistical mixture . in other words , for effects @xmath11 and @xmath5 , their statistical mixture @xmath12 becomes an effect . for simplicity",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath1 ( and hence @xmath2 ) is embeddable into a finite dimensional vector space on @xmath13 .",
    "in addition as we assume that @xmath1 ( and hence @xmath2 ) is compact with respect to a natural induced topology and thus has sufficiently many extremal points . an extremal point in @xmath1",
    "is called a pure state .",
    "a generalized probability theory ( gpt ) is a doublet @xmath14 satisfying the following properties .    *",
    "the state space @xmath1 is a compact convex set embedded in a finite dimensional vector space . *",
    "the effect space @xmath2 is a ( convex ) sub space of the dual space of @xmath1 and satisfies @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "an affine function @xmath17 satisfying @xmath18 for all @xmath19 is called a unit .",
    "hereafter we assume each effect space has the unit as its element .",
    "we call an effect space @xmath20 _ corresponding _ to a state space @xmath1 , which is the maximal set as an effect space for a given state space @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we study @xmath21 in which @xmath2 is corresponding to @xmath1 unless otherwise stated .",
    "we define the measurement with @xmath17 as follows :    an observable ( measurement ) @xmath22 is a set of effects with @xmath23 .    for @xmath10 ,",
    "its _ complement _ effect @xmath24 is also an element of @xmath2 .",
    "we call @xmath25 a zero effect .",
    "then it is easy to see @xmath26 where @xmath27 is natural order , i.e. @xmath28 means @xmath29 for all @xmath16 . for any effect @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 holds .",
    "thus , the effect @xmath32 is called a _ center _ of effect space .    the lower set of an effect @xmath30 is often used in this paper .",
    "we denote this set by @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 . the upper one is similarly defined , i.e. @xmath35 . the following proposition shows an important property of extremal effects .",
    "the complement of an extremal effect @xmath30 is also extremal effect .",
    "if @xmath36 is not extremal point then there exists @xmath37 such that @xmath38 .",
    "its complement is @xmath39 , because @xmath40 .",
    "this is contradiction to @xmath30 is extremal .",
    "in this section we study the structure of effect spaces corresponding to regular polygon state spaces . in particular we will show that the effect space corresponding to every even - sided regular polygon state space has a reflection symmetry . to clarify this point",
    ", we first introduce a special hyperplane in an effect space .    a _",
    "central hyperplane _ is a hyperplane in an effect space which contains the effect @xmath32 .",
    "a _ reflecting hyperplane _ is a central hyperplane which contains all extremal effects except for zero and unit effects .    as we will see below",
    ", the effect space corresponding to every even - sided regular polygon state space has a reflecting hyperplane . for simplicity",
    ", we often use a coordinate @xmath41 of an effect space so that its reflecting hyperplane is @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath43-level classical theory has a state space as a simplex with @xmath43 vertexes .",
    "one of the simple ways to parametrize a simplex in a vector space is to represent its extremal points as @xmath44 ( only @xmath45th element is 1 ) .",
    "the corresponding effect space is restricted by @xmath15 , hence we know it is @xmath46 .",
    "it has the extremal points @xmath47 , and it shapes hypercube in @xmath43-dimensional space .",
    "its unit and zero effects are obviously represented as @xmath48 , @xmath49 respectively .",
    "now we construct an important theory called _",
    "square bit _ ( or gbit ) by restricting the effect space .",
    "this method is introduced in [ @xcite ] .",
    "we treat the four - level classical effect space , and restrict it to a subset @xmath50 satisfying @xmath51 .",
    "the extremal points of effect space are reduced to six points as @xmath52 , zero , and unit effects .",
    "this new space shares the zero and unit effects with the original , thus @xmath50 is sub effect space .",
    "two states @xmath53 in the four - revel classical state space are equivalent ( i.e. , can not be distinguished by effects in @xmath50 ) if @xmath54 where @xmath55 , since @xmath56 for all effects @xmath30 in @xmath50 .",
    "this equivalence also allows us to reduce the dimension of state space because the state is an equivalent class of preparations .",
    "we project the original state space to a surface @xmath57 and obtain the extremal points , i.e. @xmath58 .",
    "we show the probability table of the square bit theory at table .",
    "[ tb : gbit ] .",
    "it shows that this theory is neither classical nor quantum one .",
    "these results tell us that the state space is a square and the effect space forms an octahedron . the ( normalized ) state space lives in a two - dimensional space and the effect space",
    "lives in a three - dimensional space .",
    ".square bit probabilities [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tb : poly ]    the zero effect is on the origin and unit one is on @xmath59 . for even - sided polygons , there exists a reflecting hyperplane @xmath60 .",
    "we call this parametrization a _",
    "normal _ parametrization .",
    "the different parametrization can be obtained by an affine transformation of the normal parametrization .",
    "an affine map on a @xmath61-dimensional space is described by a ( @xmath62)-dimensional augmented matrices , which are consisted from @xmath63 matrix , zero column @xmath61-vector and row @xmath64- vector with 1 at the end . if an affine map @xmath65 has its inverse @xmath66 then the dual pairs preserve the value , i.e. @xmath67 . namely , another parametrization on a state space gives the inverse translation to effect space .",
    "for @xmath68 the state space is a rectangle and the effect space forms an octahedron .",
    "this means that the four - sided regular polygon theory is equivalent to the square bit space through an affine mapping which translates unit effect to unit effect .",
    "therefore , these two represent the same system .",
    "the following proposition shows that the existence of a reflecting hyperplane is related to a symmetry of its corresponding state space .",
    "[ prop : esandss ] an effect space has a reflecting hyperplane if and only if its corresponding state space is point symmetric .",
    "we write the state as the column vector @xmath69 and the effect as the row vector @xmath70 , where @xmath71 are @xmath61-dimensional row vector .",
    "we begin with the necessity .",
    "each nontrivial extremal effect is described as @xmath72 and its complement as @xmath73 , thus a state @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath76 .",
    "therefore , if @xmath77 is a state then @xmath78 is also a state .",
    "we then show the sufficiency .",
    "we label extremal states as @xmath79 .",
    "let us assume that the state space is point symmetric with respect to the origin @xmath80 .",
    "the effects must satisfy the inequalities @xmath81 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath82 the extremal effects are cross sections of subsets of hyperplanes @xmath83 . if chosen sets contain only @xmath84 hyperplane , its corresponding effect is zero effect .",
    "similarly , if they have only @xmath85 then the effect is unit one , or else we have @xmath86 for a pair @xmath87 , hence @xmath88 .",
    "it means @xmath89 from ( [ eq : er ] ) .",
    "then , all extremal effects are on the hyperplane @xmath90 .",
    "a quantum bit ( qubit ) state and its effect spaces are both represented in bloch spheres .",
    "that is , these spaces are @xmath91 and @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a vector composes pauli matrices . to see the connection between this qubit system and the regular polygon theories",
    ", we neglect @xmath94-direction .",
    "that is , we consider a quantum - like system whose @xmath95 is only on the span of @xmath96 . in this situation ,",
    "the state and effect spaces are regarded as the circle and the bi - cone respectively .",
    "note the effect space has parameter @xmath97 to radius direction , then the effect spaces vertexes are at @xmath98 .",
    "on the other hand , the state spaces of regular polygon theories are close to a circle whose radius is @xmath99 at the limit of @xmath100 . similarly , the effect space close to a bi - cone whose vertex on @xmath101 .",
    "it , however , does not coincide with former one while is homomorphic .",
    "this difference occurs from how we earn the probability from state and effect .",
    "the probability is calculated as @xmath102 in quantum theory with the bloch sphere , and it is just @xmath103 in normally parametrized gpts . for reducing this differences ,",
    "we translate the spaces so that @xmath6 equals the state vector @xmath104 with the added element 1 at the end , and @xmath30 equals the half of the effect vector @xmath105 with @xmath97 at the end .",
    "finally , through these reduction and translation , the limit of @xmath100 is regarded as quantum limit .",
    "two quantum effects are called _ coexistent _ if one can obtain them in a single measurement scheme .",
    "while the study on coexistent effects has a long history @xcite , their complete characterization has not been known yet . on a qubit system , after a beautiful result on unbiased effects by busch @xcite , the complete characterization for general effects have been obtained @xcite .",
    "we study a possible generalization of the former result in gpts .",
    "the notion of coexistence can be easily translated to gtps .",

    "its singular focuses are @xmath119 and @xmath121 . through the translation from quantum theory to the normal parametrization , shown in [ sssec : ql ] ,",
    "the criteria is equivalent to an inequality , @xmath122 where @xmath123 are corresponding effects to @xmath117 respectively .",

    "we have shown that the existence of a reflecting hyperplane enables a generalization of the unbiased effects in the quantum theory and the coexistence problem between such generalized unbiased effects are treatable .",
