    "the type ia supernova ( sn ia ) observations indicate that the expansion of our universe is accelerating today [ 1,2 ] , which can be explained by an exotic component , referred to as dark energy , with a large negative pressure .",
    "the most obvious candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant [ 3 ] .",
    "in addition , many other cosmological models such as the quintessence [ 4 ] , the chaplygin gas [ 5 ] , the braneworld models [ 6 ] , the cardassian models [ 7 ] are proposed to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "recently , cohen et al . [ 8 ] suggested the holographic dark energy model to reconcile the breakdown in quantum field theory caused by the conflict between the effective field theory and the so - called bekenstein entropy bound [ 9,10 ] . for an effective field theory , in a box of size @xmath11 with uv cut - off @xmath12 ,",
    "the entropy @xmath13 scales extensively , @xmath14 .",
    "but for the bekenstein entropy bound , @xmath13 is non - extensive , @xmath15 .",
    "this is postulated from the peculiar thermodynamics of a black hole .",
    "cohen et al . also pointed out that , if the zero - point energy density @xmath16 is related to a uv cut - off , the total energy of the whole system with size @xmath11 should not exceed a black hole of the same size , i.e. @xmath17 .",
    "it means that the maximum entropy is in order of @xmath18 .",
    "a short distance uv cut - off and a long distance ir cut - off have been connected together .",
    "if we apply this to the universe , the vacuum energy related to the holographic principle [ 11 ] is called the holographic dark energy . thus the holographic dark energy density @xmath16",
    "is written as @xmath19 where @xmath5 is a numerical constant . as proposed by li",
    "[ 12 ] , we take the scale @xmath11 as the size of the future event horizon @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath1 is the cosmic time and @xmath22 is the hubble parameter .",
    "such a dark energy model has been constrained through many kinds of astronomical observations , including sn ia [ 13 ] , x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters [ 14 ] and a joint analysis of sn ia and cmb and lss observational data [ 15 ] .",
    "it is noted that @xmath5 is one key parameter in the holographic dark energy model [ 13 - 15 ] , which determines the evolutionary behavior of the space - time and the ultimate fate of the universe .",
    "huang et al . [ 13 ] suggested @xmath23 through a direct fit to the present available sn ia data .",
    "zhang et al . [ 15 ] showed @xmath24 by combining sn ia and cmb and lss .",
    "kao et al .",
    "[ 16 ] showed that the reasonable result is @xmath25 by calculating the average equation of state and the angular scale of the oscillation from the boomerang and wmap data on the cmb observation . unlike the observational data mentioned above , simon et al .",
    "[ 17 ] used the relative ages of a sample of passively evolving galaxies and supernova data to reconstruct the potential of dark energy .",
    "they showed that the reconstructed potentials from galaxy ages and sn are consistent . in this paper , we attempt to apply the differential ages of galaxies [ 17,18 ] to the constraint on the holographic dark energy model . if we take some fixed values @xmath5=0.6 , 1.0 and 1.4 , the corresponding results of @xmath26 and @xmath27 are not too far from each other . if we set all the parameters free , the best fitting result is @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath6 , corresponding to a quintom - type dark energy at the @xmath9 level .",
    "this result is consistent with some other independent cosmological tests .",
    "in addition , we attempt to test the fitting results using another independent method based on the data for the lookback time to galaxy clusters [ 19 ] and the age of the universe . it is shown that our method is acceptable .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    ", we briefly review the holographic dark energy model .",
    "differential ages of galaxies and constraints on holographic dark energy model are presented in sec.3 , while another independent method based on the lookback time to galaxy clusters and the age of the universe is used to test our conclusions in sec.4 .",
    "the deceleration parameter @xmath28 and equation of state @xmath29 are discussed in in sec.5 .",
    "conclusions and discussions are given in the last section .",
    "recent observations indicate that our universe has a flat geometry [ 20 ] . here",
    "we consider a spatially flat friedmann - robert - walker universe with a matter component @xmath30 ( including both baryon mater and cold dark matter ) and a holographic dark energy component @xmath31 , which means @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , the friedman equation reads @xmath33 or taking this form equivalently @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 km s@xmath39 mpc@xmath39 is the hubble constant . combining eq.([eq1 ] ) and eq.([eq2 ] ) , we derive @xmath40 meanwhile we notice that eq.([eq4 ] ) can be deduced to @xmath41 substituting eq.([eq6 ] ) into eq.([eq5 ] ) and taking derivative with respect to ln@xmath21 on both sides , we get    @xmath42    which describes the dark energy s evolution along with the factor ln@xmath21 completely . and it can also be solved analytically as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 can be determined by given @xmath45 and @xmath5 . from eq.([eq4 ] ) , it is easy to get the theoretical hubble parameter @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a function of @xmath45 and @xmath5 , i.e. , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the hubble parameter depends on the differential age of the universe as a function of @xmath0 in this form @xmath50 so @xmath3 can be directly measured through a determination of @xmath51 . by comparing the measured hubble parameter at different redshifts with the theoretical one containing some free cosmological parameters",
    ", we can constrain current cosmological models .    in this paper , we adopt data from [ 17 ] where the new publicly released gemini deep survey ( gdds ) survey [ 21 ] and archival data [ 22 - 26 ] were used to infer @xmath52 and the shape as well as redshift dependence of dark energy potential were constrained .",
    "the data contain the absolute ages of 32 passively evolving galaxies , which are further divided into three subsamples .",
    "the first subsample was composed of 10 field early - type galaxies , after discarding galaxies for which the spectral fit indicated an extended star formation .",
    "the ages of this sample were derived using the speed models [ 27 ] .",
    "the second subsample was composed of 20 old passive galaxies from gdds .",
    "the gdds old sample was reanalyzed using speed models and the ages of this sample were obtained within 0.1gyr of the gdds collaboration estimate .",
    "the third subsample consisted of two reddest radio galaxies 53w091 and 53w069 in the survey of windhorst et al .",
    "[ 24 - 26 ] . then",
    "8 numerical values of differential ages @xmath52 , equivalently @xmath3 , were obtained .",

    "we can see that the result of @xmath57 is roughly consistent with chang et al : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 by x - ray gas mass fraction of galaxy clusters [ 14 ] . for the case of @xmath61 , huang & gong [ 13 ]",
