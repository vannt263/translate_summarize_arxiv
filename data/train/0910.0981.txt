    "the mysterious normal state pseudogap phase may hold the key to understanding the origin of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprate superconductors .",
    "the basic phenomenology of the pseudogap state is that of a partial suppression of the density of states ( dos ) around the fermi energy leaving only a residue of the expected fermi surface.@xcite the gap as mapped out by angle resolved photoemission ( arpes ) has an angular dependence which is similar to the @xmath2 form that is realized in the superconducting state with the exception of a remaining partial section of fermi surface ( so - called fermi arc@xcite ) in the `` nodal '' part of the brillouin zone ( bz).@xcite therefore the pseudogap is `` antinodal '' in the sense that it has a maximum amplitude corresponding to the maximum amplitude of the superconducting gap . because of these similarites and because of the low superfluid density of these materials",
    ", it is natural to interpret the pseudogap in terms of phase disordered superconductivity.@xcite this scenario agrees with a large nernst signal detected at temperatures above t@xmath3.@xcite however , the fact that the pseudogap extends up to temperatures well above t@xmath3 where no evidence of fluctuating superconductivity is found seems to rule out this scenario as an explanation of the overall pseudogap phenomenon .",
    "another natural candidate for the opening of a spectral gap is generation of ordered phases , possibly in competition with the superconducting state .",
    "a different interpretation of the pseudogap is that it originates from a singlet - triplet gap , or spin gap , due to strong nearest neighbor spin correlations related to the fact that the system is a doped mott insulator.@xcite this is the resonating valence bond ( rvb ) scenario.@xcite along these lines it has also been argued that stripes , which are unidirectional spin and charge modulations , may play a key role and that the pseudogap would be a signature of a singlet pair correlation gap on the hole rich stripes.@xcite such a correlated state would be similar to the doped rvb state but with the distinction of being preconditioned by the charge inhomogeneity .    the existence of stripes is well established in la@xmath4ba@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lbco ) and la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 ( lsco ) [ with e.g. nd co - doping ] where both spin and charge bragg peaks associated with the stripe order can be clearly identified , presumably enhanced by a structural transition in these materials.@xcite more recently , however , evidence is accumulating that also other cuprates exhibit similar stripe correlations.@xcite in this regard the universal hour - glass spin excitation spectrum appears particularly striking,@xcite and has a simple explanation within stripe models.@xcite nevertheless , the importance and ubiquity of stripe correlations remain controversial , partly because of the complex disorder present in materials like bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( bscco ) which is , however , very amenable to spectroscopic probes like arpes and scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) .",
    "it is well - known that arpes finds a so - called momentum - space dichotomy consisting of coherent ( incoherent ) nodal ( antinodal ) quasiparticle states in the underdoped cuprates.@xcite recent arpes measurements have revealed the presence of two gaps in momentum space : 1 ) an antinodal ( pseudo)gap which persists above @xmath9 , and 2 ) a gap in the nodal region which exists only at @xmath10 and exhibits a temperature dependence consistent with a standard bcs gap.@xcite more recently yang _",
    "et al._@xcite found effectively two different types of gaps in the normal state at @xmath11 , a particle - hole symmetric gap in the antinodal part of the bz and a gap without particle - hole symmetry in the near nodal region .",
    "they also found evidence for a back bending dispersion in agreement with other recent work showing evidence for a nodal pocket instead of a disconnected arc.@xcite consistent with a possible pairing origin of the antinodal gap , kanigel _ et al._@xcite identified the existence of particle - hole symmetric bogoliubov bands in the pseudogap state .",
    "stm experiments have consistently reported significant nano - scale gap modulations in the superconducting state with large - gap regions dominant in the underdoped regime where the pseudogap is known to be significant.@xcite using the quasiparticle interference ( qpi ) technique , recent stm measurements on both bscco and ca@xmath4na@xmath5cuo@xmath7cl@xmath7 ( na - ccoc ) have revealed an electronic dichotomy similar to that found by arpes : in the low - energy sector `` conventional '' dispersing quantum interference@xcite is detected from elastic scattering of coherent states near the nodal region , whereas incoherent states at energies near the antinodal gap give rise to a reduced set of non - dispersive peaks.@xcite in real - space the low - energy local density of states ( ldos ) is largely homogeneous whereas higher bias real - space maps reveal characteristic heterogeneous checkerboard or locally stripe - like ldos modulations .",
    "this data strongly suggests the presence of extended bogoliubov states near the fermi arc and quasi - localized states near the antinodal regions.@xcite the spatially averaged dos evolves smoothly from the superconducting state into the pseudogap phase above @xmath9,@xcite where spatial nano - scale ( pseudo)gap variations persist.@xcite finally recent pseudogap low - energy qpi stm studies of underdoped bscco@xcite find a gapless fermi arc and a particle - hole symmetric antinodal gapped region in qualitative agreement with the above mentioned arpes experiments.@xcite    theoretically , a stripe ordered pseudogap state was described in the extreme ( and unrealistic ) limit of decoupled one - dimensional correlated electron liquids.@xcite although such an approach can successfully classify the possible low temperature phases , it can not readily incorporate a more realistic band structure in order to calculate a spectral function that can be compared to arpes and tunneling experiments .",
    "however , within various approximate schemes , many calculations of the spectral distribution of a striped density wave have been performed.@xcite recently , these have attracted considerable interest in the context of high magnetic field transport measurements showing quantum oscillations possibly due to severe fermi surface reconstruction from stripe ordering.@xcite this interpretation rely on electron - like single particle properties of bands which have predominant spectral weight in the antinodal region which seems at odds with the existence of an antinodal pseudogap.@xcite it should also be noted that with realistic values of the coulomb repulsion @xmath12 , both standard mean - field theory and more sophisticated approaches seem to indicate that there is no nodal spectral weight but only antinodal weight related to states centered on the hole rich stripes.@xcite    the more unsettling problem with these studies is the antinodal spectral weight itself .",
    "this is expected to be a robust feature , arising from the `` stripe bands '' which are the midgap states induced by the anti - phase domain walls in the antiferromagnetic spin texture . for finite hole doping",
    "the spectral weight from these domain walls is antinodal for bond aligned stripes as we consider here , at least in mean - field .",
    "( for realistic stripe periodicity versus hole doping . )",
    "thus , even though there is plenty of evidence that stripe correlations may be a generic feature of these materials it seems clear that such spin and charge density wave correlations will not give rise to an antinodal pseudogap .    in this work we approach the pseudogap problem by formulating a non - correlated single - particle caricature of a striped pseudogap state by including a bcs pair term with finite amplitude only on the hole rich stripes and which is decoupled by phase disorder between stripes . in hartree - fock theory of the hubbard model a striped state",
    "is realized by solving self - consistently for a collinear spin density wave ( sdw ) and a charge density wave ( cdw ) with the periodicity of the former being twice the latter.@xcite it is in this framework that we will introduce a pairing term acting only in the high hole density regions of the cdw , which is meant to mimic the actual singlet pair correlations below @xmath13 of a strongly correlated system .",
    "our main result is that such a phenomenological model with stripe order and phase disordered on - stripe pairing is in fact broadly consistent with the salient spectroscopic features found by arpes and stm .",
    "there is an approximately particle - hole symmetric antinodal spectral gap and a nodal region fermi surface ( fermi arc ) in the form of a hole pocket .",
    "in the near nodal region , just outside the pocket , the gap is due to sdw order and therefore not particle - hole symmetric .",
    "the dos is suppressed in accordance with the antinodal gap and within an energy scale corresponding to the on - stripe pair potential . in this pseudogap state",
    "the gap is positioned at the fermi level , and the dos is roughly particle - hole symmetric but may have a minimum slightly above the fermi energy due to the band dispersion giving the nodal pocket.the low - energy states that make up the fermi surface are extended while states near the pseudogap energy are strongly localized on the order of the inter - stripe spacing .",
    "finally , we also model a @xmath0-wave superconducting state coexisting with the spectral pseudogap and find a sub - gap peak in the dos which is a result of gapping the nodal arc , and a coherent pair density that is concentrated to the nodal region .",
    "we consider a tight - binding model in a static field corresponding to unidirectional ( striped ) sdw order and a spatially modulated bcs pair field which is uniform along the stripe direction but not , in general , periodic in the direction transverse to the stripes .",
    "we will consider only bond centered charge period four stripes ( spin period eight ) and , in order to reduce the number of parameters , we do not include an explicit field that couples to the charge density.@xcite here we will choose parameters such that there is a nodal hole pocket for realistic doping levels .",
    "in addition there will be antinodal weight in the form of open orbits or electron pockets .    on a square lattice with nearest neighbor hopping @xmath14 , next - nearest neighbor hopping @xmath15 , and",

    "the spin potential will generate a cdw which has slightly higher hole density on the sites with aligned spin potential , which we will refer to as the stripes .",

    "note that the pair creation and anihilation terms are symmetrized in real space coordinates and consequently spin singlet .",

    "so far we have considered only phase disordered pairing , suggesting that this is a caricature of a correlated pseudogap state with local pair correlations in the form of an on - stripe spin gap .",
    "the most obvious extension of this model to a state with long - range superconducting order would be to lock the phases between stripes .",
    "such a state would correspond to the mean - field theory of a stripe ordered superconductor with a periodically modulated superconducting order parameter , with finite components at @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( not @xmath106 for bond - centered stripes ) .",

    "for the particular case considered here ( with pairing only on the bond centered stripes ) we find a nodal line at @xmath107 thus resulting in a point node that is shifted slightly away from that of an actual @xmath0-wave superconductor with intact fourfold rotational symmetry .",

    ", in addition to the phase disordered pairing on stripes , also includes a uniform @xmath0-wave pair potential .",
    "the motivation for studying such a state comes from considering a glassy stripe state with static but only short range stripe order . in the superconducting state",

    "[ sc_dos ] .",
    "the origin and position of this peak is set by the transition of the contours of constant energy from separated `` bananas '' at low energy@xcite to a pocket at higher energy .",
    "this is similar to what has been discussed recently in the case of coexisting @xmath0-wave superconductivity and commensurate antiferromagnetism.@xcite the energy of the subgap peak , @xmath117 , depends on band - structure and is not simply linearly related to the magnitude of @xmath122 as seen in fig . [ sc_dos ] which shows the evolution of the dos with increasing magnitude @xmath122 .",
    "the pseudogap energy scale , @xmath66 , that follows from the phase disordered pairing is maintained even in the presence of the homogeneous term as long as the latter is smaller in magnitude .",
    "in contrast , a stripe ordered state with only a homogeneous pair potential has strong coherence peaks at twice the gap magnitude in addition to the smaller peak from the gapped nodal pocket as seen from the thin line in fig .",

    "figure [ ldos ] shows the dos spatially averaged over sites on ( off ) the charge stripes only , i.e the solid curve displays the dos spatially averaged over sites that contain pseudogap bonds ( see fig .",

    "one sees a low - energy `` universal '' ldos consistent with homogeneous real - space sts spectra at low ( sub - gap ) bias , but deviations in the ldos at higher energies resulting in spatially modulated ( in this case stripy ) ldos real - space maps .",
    "the fourier transform of the ldos at a @xmath46 vector corresponding to the charge order , @xmath123 , is proportional to the difference between the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ ldos ] , and hence roughly particle - hole symmetric , even in the pseudogap state .",
    "interestingly , a plot of the actual zero momentum pair density , @xmath124 , shown in fig . [ pair_density ] reveals that this quantity is dominated by weight in the nodal region on the hole pocket even though we consider a @xmath0-wave gap with larger magnitude in the antinodal regions .",
    "the reason for this is of course the coexisting antinodal pseudogap .",
    "this is consistent with a recent analysis of arpes data by kondo _",
    "et al._@xcite in which it was found that most of the coherent weight in the superconducting state is near the node .",
    "similar conclusions about a coherent smaller gap below @xmath9 on top of the pseudogap have also been reached in earlier stm , arpes and @xmath16sr work.@xcite such a two gap phenomenology is naturally suggestive of a competition between a pseudogap state of non - pairing origin and a more traditional superconducting state . in the present model where the pseudogap is a pairing gap we have in mind an alternative scenario in which the pairing arises on the stripes which then infects the extended nodal",
    "states where the actual phase coherent pair density is formed .",
    "although this mechanism is not contained in the model we may speculate that the antinodal spectral weight can not couple coherently , possibly because the pseudogapped states are too localized or because the corresponding local pair density has most of the weight in finite momentum components .",
    "the model proposed in this paper does not fall into the conventional separation of scenarios for the pseudogap state : either preformed pairs or competing order .",
    "our scenario contains both an order ( sdw and cdw stripes ) and concomitant local singlet pairing states which give rise to the spectroscopic antinodal pseudogap .",
    "surprisingly , however , the fermi arc on the nodal hole pocket is unaffected by this pseudogap mechanism irrespective of whether the local pairing symmetry is of @xmath1- or @xmath0-wave type . for the ordered sdw stripes",
    "studies here , the fermi arc is the front side of the nodal hole pocket .",
    "however , in a more realistic short - range glassy phase the pocket is wiped out and replaced by a single arc.@xcite    as mentioned above , the phase disorder has negligible effects on the extended nodal states since the effective pairing potential averages to zero for these states .",
    "one can get additional understanding of the role of phase disorder by comparing to a stripe state with non - zero pairing and fixed phase [ i.e. @xmath125 for all @xmath33 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) ] . in such a phase - ordered stripe state ,",
    "the pairing leads to nodal points at the fermi energy , and from this respect the phase disorder is crucial for generating a fermi arc . the origin of this increased spectral weight at the fermi level can be traced to the fact that significant phase differences ( e.g. @xmath112-phase shifts ) between @xmath0-wave superconducting regions separated by antiferromagnetic regions generates low - energy states.@xcite    a recent study of thermal phase fluctuations of a @xmath0-wave superconductor also found the presence of a fermi arc.@xcite in that work too , the phase disorder is crucial for generating the arc , but contrary to the present approach , no pocket exists in the nodal region from sdw ordering .",
    "even though the pocket could be destroyed by disorder one may be able to distinguish these scenarios for the fermi arc by searching for particle - hole symmetry in the near nodal region , a property that should be absent in that region of momentum space within the approach presented here .",
    "( the latter in agreement with the recent analysis of arpes measurements by yang",
    "_ et al._@xcite )    experimentally it has also been found that the fermi arc length scales with @xmath126.@xcite even though extension of the present model to a self consistent study of finite @xmath127 effects is beyond the scope of this paper , we remark that a model of granular antiferromagnetic and @xmath0-wave superconducting islands found that the phase disorder can indeed generate a @xmath127-dependence of the fermi arc,@xcite similarly to the work by altman _",
    "et al._@xcite for the present model it is natural for the arc length to vary inversely to the magnitude of the sdw potential which in mean field is expected to grow with decreasing temperature .",
    "whether or not such a variation can quantitatively reproduce the experimentally observed variations of arc length with temperature remains to be explored in more detail.@xcite    because the pseudogap proposed here remains at the fermi level ( modulo a possible small shift ) it explains the smooth evolution of the spatially averaged dos as a function of temperature from the superconducting state into the pseudogap state.@xcite as we have shown , nodal states are extended whereas antinodal states are localized effectively on individual stripes in overall agreement with recent conclusions from e.g. tunneling spectroscopy.@xcite the nodal band can cause a slight shift of the dos minimum to positive bias in the pseudogap state similar to what has been seen by recent stm measurements at @xmath11.@xcite from the arpes evidence of a quasiparticle band dispersion through the fermi level together with an antinodal gap , this shift is something we expect on general grounds , and should be explored further by future tunneling experiments .",
    "the superconducting @xmath104 condensate at @xmath10 essentially `` lives on top of '' the pseudogap phase and its main spectroscopic effect is to gap the states at the fermi arc .",
    "the superconducting gap gives rise to a sub - gap structure at @xmath10 within the pseudogap dos .",
    "interestingly , sub - gap features in the spatially averaged dos which disappear above @xmath9 have been recently pointed out by several stm experiments of underdoped cuprates.@xcite a very interesting aspect of the present model for the superconducting state is that it naturally incorporates the existence of spatially varying local pairing amplitudes .",
    "this aspect was previously proven successful in describing salient features of the ldos gap modulations measured by stm at @xmath10.@xcite specifically , it reproduces the presence of sharp coherence peaks in small gap regions@xcite and the granular transition through @xmath9 observed by gomes _",
    "et al._@xcite it is an interesting future study to extend the present model to include more realistic disorder configurations and determine whether the spatially resolved ldos is in further agreement with stm data . in the superconducting state",
    "we have seen that the low - energy ldos is roughly constant ( in space ) within this approach but it is known that correlations which penalize charge fluctuations will further stabilize nodal ldos universality.@xcite also it will be interesting to see whether the present approach can reproduce the @xmath128-space dichotomy seen by fourier transformed stm maps between the low- and high - energy momenta.@xcite in addition an essential aspect of the model is that the antinodal `` stripe '' states are localized by disorder in the phase of the local pair potential . an interesting question is whether similar localization may perhaps more realistically be caused by stripe density wave disorder .",
    "lastly , since the present model assumes sdw order it includes per construction local moments which , as shown recently , are present even in the magnetic response of the bscco materials.@xcite the overall hour - glass neutron response is therefore fully compatible with the present model even though one may have to include glassy disorder and/or soft fluctuations to reproduce details of the measured low - energy magnetic fluctuations .",
    "we presented a phenomenological model for the pseudogap state consisting of stripe spin- and charge density wave order with phase decoupled on - stripe singlet pairing .",
    "this phase is characterized by extended states giving rise to a nodal hole pocket and gapped antinodal states that are localized transverse to the stripes .",
    "the spectral function exhibits particle - hole symmetry characteristic of a pairing gap in the antinodal region whereas in the near nodal region just outside the hole pocket the gap is due to stripe order and does not display particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the nodal dispersion has the appearance of a normal metal at the fermi level but contains a kink and broadening below the pseudogap energy scale .",
    "the spatially averaged dos has a gap at the fermi level and is also roughly particle - hole symmetric in the pseudogap state even though a small shift arising from the nodal band may be observable .",
    "finally we also discussed a superconducting state coexisting with the pseudogap where the nodal pocket becomes gapped . here",
    "we find a characteristic sub - gap peak in the dos and a coherent pair density with most of the weight in the nodal region .",

    "<S> we study the electronic structure within a system of phase - decoupled one - dimensional superconductors coexisting with stripe spin and charge density wave order . </S>",
    "<S> this system has a nodal fermi surface ( fermi arc ) in the form of a hole pocket and an antinodal pseudogap . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral function in the antinodes is approximately particle - hole symmetric contrary to the gapped regions just outside the pocket . </S>",
    "<S> we find that states at the fermi energy are extended whereas states near the pseudogap energy have localization lengths as short as the inter - stripe spacing . </S>",
    "<S> we consider pairing which has either local @xmath0-wave or @xmath1-wave symmetry and find similar results in both cases , consistent with the pseudogap being an effect of local pair correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this state is a stripe ordered caricature of the pseudogap phase in underdoped cuprates with coexisting spin- , charge- , and pair - density wave correlations . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we also model a superconducting state which 1 ) evolves smoothly from the pseudogap state , 2 ) has a signature subgap peak in the density of states , and 3 ) has the coherent pair density concentrated to the nodal region . </S>"
