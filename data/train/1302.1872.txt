    "the standard model ( sm ) is extremely successful and has passed numerous experimental tests .",
    "moreover the last missing piece , the higgs particle , has recently likely been seen by the atlas and cms collaborations @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the sm is for a number of theoretical reasons incomplete .",
    "it also does not explain three known experimental facts , namely the tiny active neutrino masses , the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the existence of dark matter .",
    "a simple yet elegant way to solve two or even all of these problems is to supplement the sm by three singlets : @xmath3 where @xmath4 are majorana fields , @xmath5 are the lepton doublets , @xmath6 is the conjugate of the higgs doublet , and @xmath7 are the corresponding yukawa couplings .",
    "this is a small modification of the sm , also because so far the principles which select the fermionic representations in a given theory are ( besides for anomaly conditions ) unknown .",
    "nevertheless , this modification allows to accommodate those three experimental facts : first , after breaking of the electro - weak symmetry the active neutrinos acquire masses via the type - i see - saw mechanism @xcite .",
    "second , within the same setup the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe can be naturally explained by leptogenesis @xcite . according to this scenario the lepton asymmetry which is produced by the heavy neutrinos",
    "is converted into the baryon asymmetry by anomalous electro - weak processes @xcite .",
    "depending on the values of the masses and couplings in the generation of the asymmetry proceeds either through decays @xcite or via oscillations of the heavy neutrinos @xcite .",
    "the extension of the sm spectrum by sterile neutrino states may even provide a solution to the third problem , since sterile neutrinos are a perfect dark matter candidate ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a further possible implication of sterile neutrinos is a modified active neutrino flux in reactor experiments @xcite .",
    "this could explain the observed reduced electron antineutrino fluxes @xcite .",
    "note that the addition of singlets to the sm has actually important consequences .",
    "not only are there many new parameters , but also the global symmetries are changed , since lepton number is broken .",
    "furthermore the single scale of the sm , namely the electro - weak vev , is amended by the new mass scales @xmath8 . within",
    "the type - i see - saw the sterile neutrinos pick up masses proportional to @xmath8 and these could in principle have any value which is not excluded by experiment .",
    "it is therefore interesting to study implications of sterile neutrinos assuming any mass .",
    "some effects exist even for ultra heavy sterile neutrinos , while some are only phenomenologically important for not so heavy states , which are in the mass range of several tev or lower .",
    "the existence of majorana neutrinos has well known consequences on the phenomenology below the electro - weak scale .",
    "in particular , the new states can contribute to the amplitude of the neutrinoless double - beta decay @xcite and induce rare charged lepton decays @xcite .",
    "furthermore , they can affect the electro - weak precision observables ( ewpos ) via tree - level as well as loop contributions and thus provide an explanation for anomalies in the experimental data .",
    "in particular , the tree - level effects result in non - unitarity of the active neutrino mixing matrix @xcite and lead to a suppression of the invisible @xmath1-decay width .",
    "this is in agreement with the long standing fact that the lep measurement of the invisible @xmath1-decay width is two sigma below the value expected in the sm @xcite .",
    "furthermore the neutral - to - charged - current ratio in neutrino scattering experiments can be changed thus providing an explanation for the nutev anomaly @xcite .",
    "also a slight shift of the @xmath2 boson mass from the value derived from other sm parameters is induced , reducing the tension between the input parameters of the electro - weak fit and the experimentally observed value @xcite .",
    "these electro - weak observables are affected not only at tree - level but also by loop effects .",
    "the latter can be taken into account in the form of the oblique corrections and can partially ` screen ' the tree - level contributions , as we will see later .",
    "the impact of oblique corrections on models with non - universal neutrino gauge coupling has been studied in @xcite . in these",
    "works the tree - level effects ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and oblique ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) corrections have been treated as independent parameters .",
    "however , in the model described by the lagrangian they are functions of the majorana masses and yukawa couplings and are therefore not independent .    encouraged by the fact that sterile neutrinos are very well motivated we study their phenomenological impact in this paper .",
    "specifically we consider tev - scale sterile neutrinos with a sizable active - sterile mixing and determine their over - all contributions to the ewpos and to indirect detection experiments in the framework of the see - saw type - i extension of the sm .",
    "in contrast to the previous studies we derive expressions for the @xmath0-parameters in terms of the masses and mixing angles of the majorana neutrinos , thus all quantities effecting the observables are functions of the parameters in . our approach is therefore completely self - consistent . in sec.[lowenergyobservables ] we discuss the influence of heavy majorana neutrinos on the phenomenology below the electro - weak scale and provide expressions for the @xmath0-parameters .",
    "next we perform in sec.[fit ] a likelihood fit to the ewpos taking into account up - to - date experimental constraints including neutrino oscillation data and limits from the non - observation of rare charged lepton decays and neutrinoless double - beta decay .",
    "we find that tev - scale sterile neutrinos improve the overall fit by bringing the invisible @xmath1-decay width , the charged - to - neutral current ratio for neutrino scattering and the @xmath2 boson mass in agreement with the experimentally observed values within the experimental precision .",
    "the best - fit regions provide testable experimental signatures . for the normal- and quasi - degenerate light neutrino mass spectra",
    "we find that @xmath15 decay rates are close to the current experimental sensitivities .",
    "for the inverted hierarchy the mass region is such that part of the parameter space can be tested at the lhc after the 14 tev upgrade .",
    "finally , in sec.[summary ] we summarize the obtained results and present our conclusions .",

    "the active - sterile mixing can in particular improve the global fit and reduce some anomalies in the experimental data : first , it results in a decreased value of the invisible @xmath1 boson decay width , which is preferred by the current data ; second , it slightly increases the mass of the @xmath2 boson and brings it in the one sigma interval around the observed value .",
    "furthermore , in the case when @xmath10 is not suppressed , the model affects the charged - to - neutral current ratio for neutrino scattering and brings @xmath75 in agreement with the values observed by the nutev experiment .    in our analysis",
    "we have taken into account tree - level contributions of sterile neutrinos as well as their one - loop effects on gauge boson propagators .",

    "this finding is one of the main results of the present work .",
    "the @xmath79 is lowest for the normal hierarchy scenario and slightly higher for the inverted hierarchy and the case of the quasi - degenerate mass spectrum .",
    "we have also studied the experimental signatures of the best - fit points for each mass hierarchy . for all mass spectra the effective electron neutrino mass @xmath80  the quantity relevant for the neutrinoless double - beta decay",
    " reaches at many best - fit points values that are close to the sensitivity threshold of current experiments .",
    "the expected active - sterile mixing is of the order of @xmath161 in all three scenarios .",
    "the lightest sterile neutrino mass for normal- and quasi - degenerate mass spectra is around 2 tev .",
    "this ranges might become accessible at electron - proton colliders with energies above 6 tev . for the inverted hierarchy the majorana masses can be as low as 300 gev",
    "thus , given the predicted mixing , this scenario can be partially tested at the lhc after the 14 tev upgrade .",
    "the fit might improve in a type i+ii see - saw extension of the sm , since the vev of the additional higgs triplet also contributes to the @xmath2 boson mass .",
