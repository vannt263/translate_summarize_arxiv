    "there has been an increasing interest in the index coding problem ( icp ) because of its potential to afford throughput gain in ad hoc wireless networks .",
    "it finds commercial application in dissemination of popular multimedia content as in iptv , dvb , p2p file sharing .",
    "an instance of icp , @xmath0 , comprises a single source / transmitter possessing a set of messages , @xmath1 , and a set of clients / receivers , @xmath2 .",
    "each client , @xmath3 , knows a subset of messages , @xmath4 , a priori , and demands to know another subset of messages , @xmath5 , where , @xmath6 .",
    "these two sets are respectively named the _ has - set _ and the _ want - set _ of the client .",
    "the transmitter can broadcast functions of messages in @xmath7 to the clients via a noiseless channel .",
    "the objective is to equip the transmitter with the minimum number of encoding functions such that the demands of all the clients is satisfied upon reception of the same .",
    "such a situation may arise , for example , when a satellite or a broadcasting station wishes to transmit a large file ( message set ) to many receivers by breaking it into multiple fragments ( messages ) .",
    "some receivers may miss out certain messages due to multitude of reasons including bad or intermittent signal reception , interference from other sources , channel noise , power outage , temporary equipment failure , and bad weather .",
    "instead of retransmitting missed out messages , the transmitter can take cognizance of what the receivers already have in their cache and transmit fewer coded messages so that the demand of each receiver is satisfied .",
    "alternatively , the icp can be posed as a problem of source coding with side information available at receivers and objective is to design a code of minimum size .",
    "for example , consider the icp depicted in table[table1 ] , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     an optimal linear fic of length @xmath10 is @xmath11 and the transmissions of an optimal @xmath12-fic are @xmath13 .",
    "the matrices @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16- and @xmath12-fic respectively are given below .",
    "@xmath17 as stated before , the minimum distance of these codes are 1 and 3 respectively .",
    "@xmath18    for the ficp of table  [ tab_fldsz ] , for coding over @xmath19 , a @xmath20 $ ] code ( obtained by shortening the @xmath21 $ ] hamming code ) can be used to obtain an optimal @xmath12-fic ( @xmath15 ) ; the matrix representations of the linear code given in ( without parentheses ) are @xmath22 where @xmath23",
    ". this code does not satisfy the singleton bound .    for coding over @xmath24",
    ", we use the codewords of a @xmath25 $ ] mds code over @xmath24 ( @xmath26 ) instead of those mentioned in to obtain an optimal @xmath12-fic ( @xmath15 ) ; the codewords are @xmath27 ; the matrix representations are @xmath28 where @xmath23 .",
    "this code satisfies the singleton bound .    for coding over @xmath29 , the @xmath21 $ ] hamming code ( @xmath26 )",
    "can be concatenated to the @xmath16-fic ( @xmath14 ) to get a @xmath12-fic ( @xmath15 ) ; the matrix representations are @xmath30 where @xmath23 .",
    "this code also does not satisfy the singleton bound .",
    "a novel extension of the icp was proposed wherein client nodes can hold as side information and demand functions of messages generated by the transmitter .",
    "an fic should be such that , given the coded transmissions by source and the side information , each client should be able to resolve what the value of its demanded information is .",
    "the restriction posed by each client on the fic was formulated via gels .",
    "based on these gels , a graph was constructed and it was shown that a vertex coloring of this graph gives a valid fic .",
    "some properties of the confusion graph and bounds on the optimal code size were subsequently obtained .",
    "illustrations were provided to attest that the devised method to obtain a fic provides an optimal solution over the given alphabet .",
    "transmission over noisy broadcast channel was then studied and a necessary and sufficient condition for an fic to be @xmath31 error - correcting and lower bound on length of a @xmath31-fic were subsequently obtained .",
    "topics of further study include method of obtaining linear fics ( not necessarily optimal ) , identifying ficps with efficiently colorable confusion graphs and studying and exploiting the structure of confusion graphs to facilitate coloring and applying heuristic and approximation algorithms for the same .              y. birk and t. kol , `` informed - source coding - on - demand ( iscod ) over broadcast channels , '' in proc .",
