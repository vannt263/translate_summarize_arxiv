    "non - classical states of light such as continuous - mode fock states @xcite and their mixtures and superpositions arouse an interest because of their potential application in quantum metrology @xcite and quantum communication @xcite . theoretical description of optimal excitation of quantum system by wave packet traveling in space became one of the essential aspects of the subject @xcite .",
    "to examine excitation as well as process of storing information in a single ion , atom or quantum dot master equations description are usually considered .",
    "but instead of one equation we have here sets of coupled differential equations .",
    "derivation of master equations for a quantum system interacting with a wave packet of light prepared in a single photon state one can find , for instance , in @xcite . and for a wave packet taken in a continuous - mode fock states in @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of the phenomena of excitation of quantum system by wave packet traveling in space requires consideration of individual quantum trajectories conditional on the results of measurement of the light emitted or scattered by the system .",
    "the main theme of this paper will be determination of stochastic differential equations for quantum system interacting with chosen non - classical states of light .",
    "we will use the theory of quantum state estimation based on the idea of the non - demolition observation @xcite developed in the framework of quantum stochastic calculus @xcite . in this approach",
    "we deal with a quantum system interacting with an environment modeled by the bose field @xcite . the bose field , being an approximation of the electromagnetic field , disturbs the free evolution of the quantum system but at the same time it allows for an indirect and continuous in time observation of the system .",
    "observation of the field after interaction with the system ( the output field ) provides us with the information about the system .",
    "stochastic equation describing the time evolution of the quantum system conditioned on the results of the continuous in time measurement of the output field is called quantum filtering equation .",
    "derivation of the filtering equation for the bose field in the vacuum state one can find , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "determination of the conditional dynamics of the system interacting with the bose field in the squeezed gaussian state was given in @xcite , and for multi - channels case in @xcite .",
    "problem of derivation of filtering equations for non - gaussian states such as continuous - mode single photon state or continuous - mode cat states one can find in @xcite .    in this paper , we describe derivation of the filtering equation for two cases : for the case when the bose field is taken in a combination of the vacuum and single photon states and for the case when the bose field is in a mixture of two coherent cases . in order to specify the conditional evolution of the system we use the idea of introducing an ancilla being a source of the desired non - classical signals @xcite .",
