    "we are motivated by one of the above applications , eden growth , to obtain an analogous equation to the kpz equation in the case when the growth is radial from a seed , rather than from the usual substrate .",

    "the kpz equation comprises three terms ; surface tension , lateral growth and noise .",
    "the surface tension acts to smooth out the interface by rounding off bumps and filling in hollows .",
    "it is assumed that the time rate of change in the local height function due to surface tension is proportional to the surface curvature @xmath9^{\\frac{3}{2}}}.\\ ] ] the basis of the lateral growth contribution in the kpz equation is the assumption that all points on the growing interface move with uniform speed @xmath10 in a direction normal to the interface .",
    "the geometry underlying lateral growth in the kpz equation is shown in fig .",
    "the lateral growth contribution to the time rate of change of the height function is found by projecting the outwards normal growth in a direction orthogonal to the substrate . ignoring overhangs , the result which follows from the pythagorean theorem ( fig .",

    "( [ kpzeq ] ) , is acheived by making a small gradient approximation @xmath15 and transforming to a co - moving frame .",
    "we now consider surface tension , lateral growth and noise in a radial geometry . in this case",
    "the interface is characterized by its radial position @xmath16 at angle @xmath17 .",
    "we assume that @xmath16 is single valued so that there are no ` overhangs ' along a direction of constant @xmath17 .",
    "the noise term is now a function of @xmath17 rather than @xmath2 but otherwise it is identical to eqs .",

    "( [ radkpz ] ) has radially symmetric solutions @xmath21 where @xmath22 in the absence of surface tension the radially symmetric solutions have the form @xmath23 whereas with the inclusion of surface tension @xmath24 satisfies the transcendental equation @xmath25 another class of deterministic ` solutions ' are polygons defined by straight line segments @xmath26 where the parameter @xmath27 is fixed between the vertices of the polygon .",
    "these solutions have zero curvature along the faces however they break down at the vertices where they are not differentiable .",
    "a special class are the regular @xmath28 sided polygons @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "we mention these ` solutions ' here because exact regular polygons are obtained in on - lattice zero - noise simulations of the eden a model from a seed , where on the square lattice , @xmath31 and on the triangular and honeycomb lattices @xmath32 .",
    "the linear stability of solutions @xmath33 to the continuum model for radial growth can be investigated by substituting the perturbed solution @xmath34 into the growth equation , eq .",
    "( [ radkpz ] ) , and retaining terms to first order in the perturbation @xmath35 .",
    "this results in a linear partial differential equation to solve for the perturbation . in the special case where @xmath36 are the radially symmetric solutions the perturbation satisfies @xmath37 assuming a separable solution @xmath38 where @xmath39 now results in @xmath40 where @xmath41 is strictly positive . the coefficients @xmath42 are determined by the initial conditions @xmath43",
    ". in particular , @xmath44 hence if @xmath45 then the perturbation will decay in time and the radially symmetric solutions will be asymptotically stable .",
    "we can use the above analysis to investigate the linear stability of the regular polygon solutions .",
    "the idea is to consider an initial regular polygon profile as an initially perturbed radially symmetric solution @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the perturbation initially satisfies @xmath47 where @xmath48 is defined in eq .",
    "( [ poly ] ) .",
    "it is a simple exercise to verify that the conditions in eq .",
    "( [ cc ] ) are met in this case and thus the starting regular polygon will relax to the radially symmetric solution .",
    "this is a direct consequence of surface tension suppressing growth at the vertices .",
    "the persistence of regular polygon solutions in zero noise eden growth is due to a balance between this surface tension and the underlying lattice anisotropy .",
    "in general the stability of arbitrary profiles can be investigated directly by numerically integrating the continuum equation for radial interface growth with the given profile as an initial condition . in the numerical studies reported below",
    "we have employed the simple discretizations @xmath49    fig .",

    "the diamond profile is smoothed out and approaches a circular profile in agreement with the predictions of the linear stability analysis above . in the integration with surface tension",
    "this approach to the circular profile is faster .",
    "4 shows time ( number of iterations ) snapshots of the growing interface starting from a circle in a stochastic integration with @xmath56 a random number in the range @xmath57 $ ] and physical parameters @xmath58 . in this simulation @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",

    "5 shows a log - log plot of the surface width versus time ( number of iterations ) , averaged over five stochastic integrations , with parameters as in fig .",
    "4 . also shown on this plot is a straight line of best fit with slope @xmath61 .",
    "this suggests that the continuum equation , eq .",
    "( [ radkpz ] ) , for radial interface growth is in the same universality class as the kpz equation .",
    "we have derived the stochastic partial differential equation , eq .",
    "( [ radkpz ] ) , for the evolution of a growing interface in a radial geometry .",
    "the equation has regular polygon solutions as well as radially symmetric solutions in the deterministic limit .",
    "linear stability analysis reveals that the regular polygon solutions are unstable in favour of the radially symmetric solutions .",
    "the numerical solution of the fully stochastic equation indicates that the width of the interface scales with the same exponent , @xmath62 , as the kpz equation . presumably this result can be obtained exactly and thus",
