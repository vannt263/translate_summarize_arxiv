    ". this may be due to the periodic boundary conditions and the simulation box as well as a system size , which is much smaller ( @xmath77 ) compared to the nanocrystals ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "+ since all the simulations are performed in a box with 2048 particles and periodic boundary conditions , it has to be ensured , that finite size effects do not play a decisive role concerning the structures , energetics and transition temperatures . to this end , the system size was varied between 500 and 32000 particles , whereupon the only differences were observed in shifts of the transition temperatures @xmath79 ( b19@xmath0@xmath2b2 ) of about 5  k and @xmath80 ( b2@xmath2@xmath66 ) of about 10  k when going to the larger systems ( see fig.[f10 ] ) .",

    "+      it is a well - known experimental fact , that temperatures , at which the structural changes between martensite and austenite in niti take place , are very sensitive to small deviations of the ni / ti concentration from the ideal one with 50% ni and 50% ti @xcite .",
    "the effect , that b19@xmath0@xmath2b2 transition temperatures in niti decrease with increasing ni- or ti - concentration is reasonable in a sense , since the crystallographic ground states of the pure materials ni ( fcc ) and ti ( hcp ) differ from a monoclinic structure corresponding to the alloy phase b19@xmath0 .",

    "the measured decrease of @xmath84 seems to be yet steeper than in the simulations , which is confirmed by the experiments of hanlon _ et al .",
    "it was pointed out by several authors @xcite , that experimental transition temperatures in niti depend strongly on the processes of material preparation before the actual measurement , since varying ageing temperatures and durations as well as quenching rates can lead to precipitation effects of intermediate phases .",

    "because of a constant number of particles , a lowering in height is equivalent to a broadening of the peaks , or more and more lengths @xmath100 differing from the ideal one at @xmath16=@xmath17  k. this is located at the peak maximum , which itself is shifted by about 0.2 @xmath23 per ni - percent , resulting in smaller monoclinic shear angles @xmath42 . heating the system leads to thermal peak broadening and small horizontal shift , but the effect of concentration to the relative peak structure remains unchanged .",

    "khalil - allafi and amin - ahmadi measured austenitic start- and end - temperatures ( @xmath124 ) as well as enthalpies @xmath125 in b19@xmath0@xmath2b2 transitions for niti with ni content between 50.3% and 51.0% @xcite . @xmath79=@xmath89 and @xmath125 show nearly linear behavior with composition in this range and can therefore be extrapolated to 50% ni , what leads to @xmath126=@xmath127=0.044  @xmath128 , in good agreement with the value obtained in the simulation of 0.045  @xmath128 .",
    "ab initio _",
    "studies @xcite state an entropic stabilization of the high temperature phases in niti by vibrational entropy and phonon mode softening , respectively .",
    "if , in the present simulation , the temperature is decreased again , a jump of @xmath40 at @xmath16=@xmath80 back to the b19@xmath0-curve is not observed , because the system does not transform to b19@xmath0 upon cooling , as explained in sec.[sec3a ] .",
    "nevertheless , investigation of @xmath116 and @xmath119 shows the occurence of a phase transition ( b2@xmath2@xmath66 ) by revealing the contrary behavior to the heating process : the energetically more favorable structure with lower entropy is adopted by the system .",
    "+ moreover , with the help of free energy calculations it is possible to detect free energy barriers in transformation paths between the occurring structures , which are typical in first - order phase transitions and responsible for hysteresis . as an example , a linear path between b19@xmath0 and b2 is modeled , and at each intermediate step , the free energy is calculated by a simulation as above . to this end",
    ", the system is set up in a structure between b19@xmath0 and b2 with edge lengths @xmath41 and an angle @xmath42 of the unit cells [ see fig.[f1](a ) ] according to : @xmath129 with a parameter @xmath130 varying from 0 ( b19@xmath0 ) to 1 ( b2 ) , and values for the reference structures obtained in this work ( see tab.[tab1 ] ) .",
    "the angles @xmath53 ( between @xmath44- and @xmath45-edge ) and @xmath131 ( between @xmath45- and @xmath46-edge ) remain at 90@xmath132 . the system is forced to stay in this structure by a stiff simulation box with edge lengths and angles according to the unit cells values , but the larger the system size , the less is a stiff box able to hold the system into a defined structure .",
    "therefore the number of particles is reduced to 500 in this study .",
    "fig.[f8 ] shows the results at different temperatures @xmath16 and ni concentrations @xmath94 in form of @xmath133 .",
    "thus , the differences in @xmath40 can be seen along the transformation path and compared for varying @xmath16 and/or @xmath94 , without accounting for the absolute @xmath40 values .",

    "the error bars at the values for @xmath94=@xmath96 result from averaging over 3 randomly assembled systems . ]",
    "+ regarding the system with @xmath94=@xmath105 , a free energy barrier can be detected for @xmath16=@xmath134  k , which flattens when going to higher temperatures .",
    "the b2 structure lies in a minimum of @xmath123 , too , but this is not surprisingly , since the potential parameters were determined by fitting to material properties of b2 at @xmath16=@xmath17  k. nevertheless , at low temperatures , b19@xmath0 exhibits a lower @xmath123 , but already at @xmath16=@xmath135  k , more than 100  k below the phase transition , b2 would be more stable , and only the barrier in @xmath123 prevents the system from transforming . upon cooling ,",
    "the barrier does not disappear , which explains , why a b2@xmath2b19@xmath0 transition is not observed in the simulations .",
    "increasing the ni content to 51% leads to a less pronounced free energy barrier at @xmath16=@xmath134  k with a more kinked curve shape , which is caused by slight reorientations of the initially set up structures , and to considerable uncertainties when averaging over 3 differently assembled systems .",
    "this behavior reflects the result of sec.[sec3b ] , where a more unstable and thus more fluctuating lattice structure has been obtained by varying the ni concentration away from 50% . as a consequence , transition temperatures decrease ,",
    "what is confirmed here , too , since the @xmath123 barrier vanishes already at about 200  k.",
    "in this work , md simulations of the temperature driven structural phase transitions in niti alloys with equi- or nearly equiatomic composition were carried out by using a semi - empirical model potential from the literature @xcite ( tbsma ) , since this is known to predict a monoclinic structure to be energetically more favorable than a cubic one at @xmath16=@xmath17  k. + it could be shown , that a b19@xmath0 structure is stable within this model at low temperatures , and a slight modification concerning the cutoff behavior of involved functions leads to good agreement of lattice parameters and energetics with _ ab initio _ and experimental results . by analyzing simulation box shape , radial distribution function ( rdf ) and nearest neighbor ( nn ) environments during an increase followed by a decrease of the imposed temperature , structural phase transitions were observed . while at @xmath16=@xmath79 during heating ( 318  k for ni@xmath83ti@xmath83 ) the system adopts a nearly cubic structure closely related to b2 , at a temperature @xmath16=@xmath80 upon cooling , a structure denoted @xmath66 emerges .",
    "this has nearly the same rdf than b19@xmath0 , but the nn s belonging to the rdf peaks are resorted , resulting in a larger cohesive energy of about 0.04% .",
    "so it can be stated , that the tbsma approach predicts a stable b19@xmath0 , which is very close to the martensitic ground state @xmath66 of this model .",
    "+ the experimentally known fact , that transition temperatures ( tt ) vary strongly with nickel concentration was confirmed qualitatively at the ni - rich side and even quantitatively in the range between 50% and 51% nickel . at the ti - rich side , there exist only a few and partly conflicting experimental results , which do not fit well with the simulated curves .",
    "the discrepancies may be due to precipitation effects in the material processing before the measurements , which do not emerge in the simulations . by investigation of nn distances for systems with @xmath94@xmath95@xmath105 during heating",
    ", it could be shown , that the strong decrease of the austenitic tt is attended by a destabilization of the b19@xmath0 lattice structure .",
    "this destabilization results from the bonding part of the cohesive energies in the direct vicinity of a ni-``impurity '' , which is lower than in a perfect b19@xmath0 niti .",
    "a relation between lattice stability and tt values was also proposed by lu _",
    "@xcite , who performed _ ab initio _",
    "charge density calculations of b2 ni - rich niti .",
    "+ thermodynamic calculations gave more insight into the phase transition process by confirming that the high temperature phase is entropically stabilized , with a jump of @xmath137 at @xmath16=@xmath79 fitting well with recent experimental results @xcite .",
    "free energy barriers suppressing the phase transitions were determined along a linear path between b19@xmath0 and b2 , and it could be shown , that the heights of these barriers are lowered by increasing on the one hand temperature and on the other hand nickel concentration from 50% to 51% ."
