    "since the discovery of the so called magnetic superconductors rusr@xmath2rcu@xmath16o@xmath17 ( ru-1212 ) and rusr@xmath2(r , ce)@xmath2cu@xmath2o@xmath5 ( ru-1222 ) , with r = gd , eu,@xcite considerable effort has been devoted to the understanding of the interplay between the ferromagnetic ( fm ) component , emerging from the long - range order of the ru moments , and the onset of the superconducting ( sc ) state.@xcite among several important topics , the possibility of @xmath18-phase formation across the ruo@xmath2 layers,@xcite the itinerant or localized character of the magnetism of the ru moments , mccrone01,tallon02,mccrone02 the magnetic phase separation scenario of nanoscale fm clusters with superconductivity nucleating only in the surrounding antiferromagnetic matrix,@xcite and the possibility of triplet paring,@xcite have been considered to explain how this puzzling coexistence may occur . on the other hand ,",
    "some important superconducting parameters have been less thoroughly investigated .",
    "reports include the determination of the coherence length @xmath19 and the higher critical field @xmath20,@xcite and the intragrain london penetration length @xmath21,@xcite and rough estimations of the lower critical field of the grains , @xmath0.@xcite in relation to the determination of @xmath0 , a diamagnetic signal has been observed in a few cases at the low field range of the @xmath22 magnetization loops in ru-1222 , with a negative minimum at about 25 oeawana and 50 oe.@xcite    there are also fewer studies on relevant intrinsic superconducting properties , such as the intragrain critical current density , @xmath1,felner ijmp mainly because the strong fm contribution to the magnetization from the ru sublattice makes impracticable the use of the magnetic hysteresis loops to determine both @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the present study",
    "we overcome this intrinsic difficulty and present a reliable method to determine these magnitudes and their temperature dependencies in ru-1222(gd ) , through a systematic study of the hysteresis in the isotemperature magnetoresistance @xmath23 curves .",
    "since no single crystals are available for this compound , polycrystalline materials were used in the present investigation .",
    "two different ru-1222(gd ) samples were studied , obtained under different partial oxygen pressures . at variance with the behavior of the high - t@xmath13 cuprates , a monotonic increase without saturation in both @xmath0 and @xmath1 on cooling",
    "was observed , reaching values as high as @xmath0 @xmath24 1000 oe and @xmath1 @xmath24 10@xmath11 a/@xmath25 , at @xmath26 = 7.5 k. a comparison with yba@xmath2cu@xmath27o@xmath28 ( ybco ) and with the results reported for modeling the magnetic properties of ru-1212 on the basis of the theory of the sc / fm multilayers is presented .",
    "polycrystalline rusr@xmath2gd@xmath3ce@xmath4cu@xmath2o@xmath5 was prepared by conventional solid - state reaction using an oxygen flow in the final heat treatment .",
    "the room temperature x - ray diffraction pattern corresponds to ru-1222(gd ) , with no spurious lines .",
    "scanning electron microscopy revealed a dense grain packing , with an average grain size d @xmath29 0.5 - 1 @xmath30 m .",
    "more details on sample preparation and microstructure can be found elsewhere.@xcite after characterization , the as - prepared ( _ asp _ ) sample was annealed for 24 hours at 600@xmath31c under 50 atm of pure oxygen [ high oxygen pressure ( _ hop _ ) sample ] .",
    "magnetotransport and ac magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite reproduce the behavior of good quality samples.@xcite bars of @xmath29  10 mm in length and 0.6 mm@xmath32 cross sectional area were cut from the sintered pellet .",
    "the resistance was measured with a standard four contacts probe using a quantum design ppms system , at @xmath26 = 7.5 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11.25 , 12.5 , and 15 k for the _ asp _ sample ; the _ hop _ sample was also measured at 8.5 k. a large number of @xmath23 curves were collected for each temperature to accurately follow the different characteristic regimes found in the magnetoresistance response ( as described below ) , and to warrant a reliable quantitative determination of the fields at which the transition from one regime to another occur . the most relevant experimental parameter varied experimentally is the maximum applied field within the @xmath33 curves , @xmath34 , which ranged from a few tens of oe up to 60 koe .",
    "in order to characterize the transport behavior of the studied samples we initially measured the temperature dependence of the resistivity .",
    "it is clear from the data shown in fig .",
    "1 that oxygenation under pressure strongly reduces the absolute resistivity values , enlarges the linear behavior of the normal - state region , and reduces the width of the sc transition .",
    "in addition , the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath35 , as determined from the peaks in the derivative of the resistivity for the as prepared ( _ asp _ ) sample , increases by approximately 3 k in the _ hop _ sample .",
    "these features agree with previous reports in good quality materials.@xcite the present         + study concentrates in results of resistance as a function of field , @xmath23 , measured at fixed temperature with different maximum fields , @xmath34 , in each sweep .",
    "four different behaviors were identified in the @xmath23 curves as @xmath34 is increased : a ) a zero resistance region , typically for @xmath36 @xmath37 100 oe ; b ) an interval of reversible dissipation up to an irreversible field @xmath38 , from about 150 oe to 1500 oe for the _ asp _ sample and up to 3000 oe for the _ hop _ sample ; c ) an @xmath34-dependent hysteretic behavior , and d ) an hysteretic response independent of @xmath34 .",
    "figure 2 shows selected magnetoresistance hysteresis loops for the _ hop _ sample with @xmath34 = 5000 oe , measured at @xmath26 = 7.5 and 10 k , normalized to the @xmath39 values .",
    "for each temperature , loops similar in shape but broader were obtained for the _ asp _ sample . in the hysteretic region",
    "the resistance curves measured with decreasing external field , @xmath40 , are always below the corresponding virgin curves , @xmath41 , measured with increasing field .",
    "when the difference @xmath42 is plotted , a peak is always obtained at a certain intermediary value of the applied field , @xmath43 . with the rise in @xmath34 , the peak gradually increases its amplitude , @xmath44 , and shifts to higher @xmath43 values until a certain field @xmath34 @xmath45 @xmath46 is reached , that we denote as a saturation field . for @xmath47 @xmath48",
    "@xmath46 the peak in @xmath49remains unchanged . to illustrate this behavior , fig .",
    "3 plots @xmath50 as a function of @xmath43  for different values of @xmath34 , for the _ hop _ sample at @xmath26 = 12.5 k.        we focus our attention on a careful determination of @xmath38 and @xmath46 .",
    "since @xmath40 diverge smoothly from @xmath51 , it is necessary to implement a method for this evaluation .",
    "we proceeded as follows : a ) the error @xmath52 in the determination of @xmath23 was taken as the average of the standard deviations of each measured experimental point in a given loop ; we found that successive @xmath23 curves measured at each temperature for different @xmath34 ( typically 15 - 20 curves ) always fell inside this @xmath52 criterion ; b ) for each temperature , @xmath53 was plotted as a function of @xmath34 , as shown in fig .",
    "4 for the _ hop _ sample         + at @xmath26 = 12.5 k , and the data fitted using a polynomial function ; the error in the determination of @xmath53 is @xmath54 ; c ) @xmath40 is considered reversible if @xmath53(@xmath34 ) does not exceed the @xmath52 threshold , as indicated by a dotted line above the zero resistance level in the inset of fig .",
    "4 ( low @xmath34 region ) ; the irreversibility field , @xmath38 , is determined from the intersection of the fitted polynomial function with the @xmath52 level ( fig .",
    "4 , inset ) ; d ) the plateau observed for @xmath44 for the high @xmath34 range was fitted by a straight line parallel to the @xmath34 axis ( continuous line in fig .",
    "4 , main panel ) ; e ) the saturation field , @xmath46 , was determined as the field for which the polynomial function diverges in @xmath54 from the fitted straight line , ( intersection with the dashed line , parallel and below the plateau level in fig .",
    "4 , main panel ) . as we discuss below , @xmath55  is a good estimation of the lower critical field of the grains , @xmath0 .",
    "the temperature dependencies of @xmath0 and @xmath46 for the _ asp _ and _ hop _ samples are plotted , in fig . 5 and in the inset of fig . 6 , respectively .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 for ybco ( with the field parallel to the sample s _ c _ axis ) is also shown for comparison in the inset of fig .",
    "the @xmath14 and @xmath56 curves for both samples monotonically decrease with the increase in temperature and smoothly merge at about 15 k. the values of @xmath1 at different temperatures , determined by using the bean critical state model,@xcite as described below , are shown in fig . 6 .",
    "a systematic increase of @xmath1 on cooling is found , with slightly higher values for the _ hop _ sample .",
    "a key point to understand the features of the @xmath23 curves is to recognize that the magnetization in the grains contributes to the effective local field at the intergranular junctions .",
    "hysteresis in the magnetoresistance was recently observed in ceramic ru-1222 samples,@xcite and a preliminary analysis evidenced that the granular character of the material is relevant . unlike ru-1212 , in ru-1222 the coercive field and the remanent magnetization vanish at the sc transition , @xmath57 @xmath7 @xmath58 @xmath59 , for both gd@xcite and eu@xcite based compounds , even though the magnetic transition temperatures are much higher . since the gd ions are decoupled from the ru moments,@xcite no changes in the irreversibility behavior are observed when gd is replaced in ru-1222 by eu .",
    "the essential feature governing the irreversibility response in ru-1222 is the thick ( r , ce)@xmath2o@xmath2-fluorite - type blocks separating the ruo@xmath2  planes .",
    "the large separation distance strongly weakens the superexchange interactions between the magnetic layers , which are weakly coupled through dipole - dipole interaction.@xcite  therefore , the hysteretic behavior of the @xmath23 curves has a sc origin in ru-1222 .        for a low applied magnetic field , @xmath43 ,",
    "the net local field at the intergranular junctions is not strong enough to destroy all the sc percolative paths across the weak - linked network , leading to the observed zero resistance region in @xmath23 . for @xmath43 @xmath48 @xmath36 ,",
    "the connectivity of the network is affected in such extent that the current across the sample can not flow without dissipation , and a sizable resistance appears .",
    "the existence of a reversible         + dissipation section in the @xmath23 curves evidence that the grains have not yet been penetrated at this field range , and there is no intergranular pinning .",
    "irreversible @xmath23 loops appear when the local field at the junctions penetrates the grains . for polycrystalline high - t@xmath13 cuprates",
    "this local field is higher than @xmath60 due to flux compression associated to diamagnetic shielding , leading to an underestimation of @xmath0 . for ru-1222",
    ", the contribution of the fm magnetization to the local field at the intergranular network , @xmath61 , is oriented in opposition to @xmath43 , diminishing the flux compression effect .",
    "it was recently determined that @xmath62 is approximately 15 oe at @xmath63= 0 k for ru-1222.@xcite since @xmath64 varies from 100 to 3000 oe , any possible difference between the local penetration field of the grains and @xmath43 due to the contribution of @xmath62 is approximately 10% or less .",
    "therefore , by determining @xmath55 one obtain a good estimation of @xmath0 .",
    "let us consider the effects of the flux trapped in the grains on the @xmath23 loops .",
    "for a given @xmath34 @xmath48 @xmath0 , a fraction of the grain volume is penetrated .",
    "when @xmath43 is decreased different field profiles are created inside the grains due to pinning , gradually evolving as @xmath43 diminishes.@xcite each field profile represents a spatial circulation of currents , i.e. , a certain sc magnetization , contributing with a local field @xmath65 at the intergranular junctions .",
    "the lowest value of @xmath60 at which full reversal is obtained is @xmath66.@xcite until the fully reversed profile is not attained , the exact value of @xmath65 for a given @xmath43 in the returning curve changes as @xmath47 increases , because a different field profile is obtained for that external field .",
    "the extent of the compensation between @xmath43 and @xmath65 at the junctions as the returning curves are collected is clearly evidenced by the changes in the maxima of @xmath67 the amplitude of the peak in @xmath68 , as shown in fig .",
    "the peaks correspond to a maximum average compensation of the local fields in the polycrystal , a relative maximum in the connectivity of the weak - linked network , as @xmath43 is decreased .",
    "the increase in amplitude of the peaks for higher @xmath34  is associated to a narrowing of the distribution of local fields in the sample as the sc magnetization of the grains rises .",
    "the position of the peaks is shifted to higher fields with the rise in @xmath34 up to @xmath46 , because the field profile inside the grains becomes reversed in a larger extent , gradually leading to a higher @xmath65 in opposition to @xmath43 ; the maximum compensation occurs at higher @xmath43 .",
    "once the external field is high enough to reach the fully reversed profile there will be no further increase in @xmath65 with the rise in @xmath34 , and the @xmath44 maxima remain unchanged . therefore @xmath69 . since the fm contribution to the local field is not hysteretic",
    ", it has no effect on @xmath46 .",
    "let us compare the absolute values and temperature dependence of @xmath0 in ru-1222 with ybco .",
    "due to the wide sc transition width in the former , the higher temperature for which @xmath0 was determined is @xmath26 = 15 k ( @xmath70 @xmath7 0.3 ) . for this @xmath6 value , the lower critical field in ybco",
    "has already reached its saturation value , @xmath0(ybco ) @xmath29 850 oe@xcite ( with @xmath71 parallel to the _ c_-axis ) , while it is only 150 oe for both ru-1222 samples . however , due to its monotonic increase on cooling , @xmath0 reaches a value twice larger than ybco for the ru-1222 _ asp _ sample , and even higher for the _ hop _ one ( 3000 oe ) at 7.5 k ( @xmath6 @xmath7 0.2 ) .    at this point",
    "it is important to consider whether there is a possible contribution from surface barriers in the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "it should be noted that ru-1222 exhibits a monotonic increase of @xmath72 on cooling without saturation down to @xmath26 = 5 k,@xcite at variance with the high - t@xmath13 cuprates .",
    "this implies a reduced efficiency of any possible barrier shielding with the decrease in temperature , since a decrease in @xmath73 favours the flux penetration through weak spots at the grain surface .",
    "another important point is the strong decrease in @xmath74 in samples with higher partial oxygen pressure during the final heat treatment.@xcite therefore , flux penetration through the weak spots must be easier for the _ hop _ sample in comparison to the _ asp _ one , and the higher @xmath0 values obtained for the former can not be explained as due to surface barriers .",
    "in addition , ru-1212 and ru-1222 present a very distinctive structural feature : the existence of sharp antiphase boundaries with local distortions separating structural domains of coherently rotated ruo@xmath75 octahedra .",
    "a high density of quite sharp boundaries , of several tens of unit cells in length , have been observed in high resolution transmission electron microscopy images.mclaughlin in ceramic superconductors , long - range distortions , as twinning planes@xcite and columnar defects,@xcite are known to act as channels for flux penetration , dramatically suppressing surface barriers shielding .",
    "antiphase boundaries should work very similarly .",
    "these considerations strongly indicate that surface barriers effects are not the source of the observed @xmath0 dependence in polycrystalline ru-1222 .",
    "the large @xmath0 values obtained at low temperatures are somewhat unexpected since , as mentioned above , previous reports based on @xmath22 curves inferred @xmath0 values as low as 25 - 50 oe in ru-1222.awana,felner01,felner02 nevertheless , clear evidence that these reports greatly underestimate the magnitude of @xmath0 comes from measurements in samples with partial substitution of ru by non - magnetic elements .",
    "the negative diamagnetic minimum in @xmath76is shifted to @xmath24 300 oe for 30% substitution of ru by sn,@xcite and 40% substitution by nb,@xcite even though @xmath57 is decreased in both cases .",
    "moreover , the zero net magnetization point in the virgin @xmath22 curves ( for which a significant diamagnetic signal is still present ) is observed for @xmath43 @xmath10 800 oe in both systems .",
    "these results indicate that the masking effect of the fm background is strong , and that the actual magnitude of @xmath77 is in fact considerably higher .",
    "further evidence of @xmath78values of the order of several hundreds oe in ruthenate - cuprates comes from the magnitude of the internal ru magnetization and the local fields at different points of the cell .",
    "it has been determined that the in - plane magnetization at the ruo@xmath2 layers is @xmath79 kg , yielding a macroscopic ( cell volume average ) dipolar internal field @xmath80",
    "@xmath81@xmath37@xmath82@xmath48@xmath83 oe.@xcite the latter value is confirmed by gd@xmath84-electron spin resonance@xcite and muon spin rotationbernhard01 measurements , giving internal fields of @xmath24 600 - 700 oe at the gd site and near to the apical oxygen of the cuo@xmath85 pyramid , respectively .",
    "flux expulsion from the grains can occur only if , at a certain sufficiently low temperature , @xmath14 exceeds the magnetization value of @xmath86 .",
    "this internal  meissner effect has been previously observed in ru-1222 at @xmath26 = 16 k , which is about 30 k below @xmath57 , in samples made using an oxygen flow.@xcite    the temperature dependence of @xmath0 can be understood when the magnetism of the ru sublattice is properly considered . a model for the magnetic properties of the ru-1212 system that incorporates the theory of the superconducting / ferromagnetic multilayers predicts an increase in @xmath0 with the decrease in temperature.@xcite this response was obtained assuming @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath57 , which is the case for both ru-1222 and ru-1212 compounds , and ascribed to the decrease of the effective josephson coupling between the sc planes due to the exchange field at the fm layers .",
    "in addition , the mentioned @xmath89 dependence for ru-1222 supports the increase of @xmath0 as the temperature diminishes , within the framework of a bcs - type behavior . under this assumption ,",
    "the strong increase in @xmath89 with the rise of the oxygen pressure supports a significant increase of @xmath0 for the _ hop _ sample .",
    "the order of magnitude of @xmath1 was determined using the expression @xmath90 , corresponding to the bean critical state model for an infinite sc slab,@xcite with @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93  and @xmath94 .",
    "the expression for an infinite slab gives the highest possible values for @xmath1 according to the geometry of the sc grain . for a cylindrical geometry",
    "there will be a decrease by one order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , the calculated values @xmath1",
    "@xmath24 10@xmath11 a/@xmath12 should be considered as an upper limit .",
    "this large order of magnitude can be explained in terms of the magnetic phase separation scenario.@xcite ferromagnetic nanoclusters in the normal state are embedded in an antiferromagnetic matrix in which superconductivity nucleates . since the sc coherence length @xmath19 for ru-1222 is about the same size as the magnetic clusters,@xcite they can effectively act as pinning centers .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath1 with the decrease in temperature can also be qualitatively explained in terms of the segregation of fm clusters .",
    "it has been demonstrated for ru-1222(eu ) that the saturation magnetization of this magnetic species monotonically increases on cooling down to 10 k,@xcite well inside the sc region .",
    "this result _ _  _ _ is due to an increase of the density of fm clusters and/or to variation of their sizes with the decrease in temperature .",
    "as the number of magnetic clusters increases at lower temperatures , the average matching between the abrikosov lattice and the spatial arrangement of pinning - cluster centers is gradually improved .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that while oxygenation under pressure increases the values of @xmath0 by nearly a factor of two at low temperatures , the increase in @xmath1 is moderate .",
    "these results suggest that the oxygen treatment has a larger effect in the region near the grain boundaries .",
    "flux penetration begins at lower fields for the _ asp _ sample because a larger deviation from the oxygen stoichiometry at the grain borders locally depresses superconductivity .",
    "since @xmath1 is influenced by the properties of the grain as a whole it is less affected by the oxygenation process .",
    "the significant decrease of the absolute resistivity values and the reduction in the width of the sc transition for the _ hop _ sample in comparison to the _ asp _ one , while the intragrain sc transition temperature increases only by @xmath24 3 k , confirm that the intergranular connectivity is greatly improved with oxygenation under pressure , while the core of the grains change in a much less extent .",
    "in summary , fundamental characteristic properties of ru-1222 , the lower critical field of the grains and the intragrain critical current density , were determined after a detailed processing of magnetoresistance loops , @xmath33 .",
    "the @xmath0 values at low temperatures in well oxygenated samples are about fifty times larger than the naive estimation obtained from magnetization measurements at low magnetic fields ; the magnitude of @xmath1 is similar to the high - t@xmath13 cuprates .",
    "the possible segregation of normal - state ferromagnetic nanoclusters provides a natural scenario to explain the monotonic increase of both @xmath14 and @xmath15  on cooling .",
    "we thank s. smansunaga and r. jardim for assistance with sample oxygenation under high pressures , and e. altshuler for useful comments .",
