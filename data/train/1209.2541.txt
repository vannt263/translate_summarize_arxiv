    "throughout human history epidemic diseases have been a constant threat .",
    "the plague of athens wiped out 25 - 35 percent of the city s population as early as 430 bc @xcite . a bubonic plague epidemic killed between 75000 and 100000 inhabitants of london between april 1665 and january 1666 , as its population was about 460000 @xcite .",
    "smallpox became a constant threat to europe throughout the eighteenth century , where growing cities like london were especially vulnerable to the disease on account of providing incessant susceptible immigrant hosts to the virus @xcite .",
    "after a brief respite during the 20th century epidemics are on the rise again .",
    "for instance in 2010 , around 655000 people died of malaria @xcite .",
    "combating such epidemic diseases efficiently in the mega - cities of the future is likely to require a heightened understanding of the dynamics of the diseases and the social networks on which they spread .",
    "the horrendous examples above illustrate that epidemic diseases can have devastating effects on populations .",
    "it is easily conceivable that this has a drastic effect on population structure and specifically on the structure of social contact networks in the population .",
    "simultaneously , the fate of epidemics strongly depends on properties of the contact networks , leading to a complex interplay .    in the past two decades",
    ", epidemic spreading has been extensively studied on different complex networks to understand the influence of the social contact network structure on the disease prevalence @xcite . in particular",
    ", it has been shown that a crucial determinant of epidemic spreading is the _ degree distribution _ of the contact network , i.e. the probability distribution of finding an agent with a given number of contacts .",
    "if the variance of this distribution is finite then there is generally a threshold of infectiousness , which the disease has to exceed to persist in the network @xcite .",
    "by contrast , if the variance of the degree distribution is infinite , such as in certain scale - free networks , then the epidemic threshold vanishes @xcite and diseases can persist by hierarchical spreading from hub nodes of high degree @xcite .",
    "thus scale - free networks allow unlikely diseases with low infectiousness to spread and become endemic .    today",
    ", the structure of social networks is recognized as a key factor with direct implications for epidemic dynamics and potential counter measures @xcite .",
    "this insight has motivated the integration of real world network data into epidemic models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , theoretical models have been extended by including several properties of real world networks such as degree constraints @xcite , clustering @xcite , information filtering @xcite , social hierarchy @xcite , and nonuniform transmission probabilities @xcite .",
    "a relatively recent addition is to consider also the feedback of the epidemic on the social network structure , which can be indirect , e.g. by triggering behavioural changes of agents @xcite , or direct by removing agents due to hospitalization , quarantine or death .",
    "modelling the network response to an ongoing epidemic leads to an adaptive network , a system in which a dynamical interplay between the dynamics of the network and the dynamics on the network takes place @xcite .",
    "epidemics on adaptive networks can exhibit complex emergent dynamics @xcite ( e.g. sustained oscillations , bistability , and hysteresis ) and emergent topological properties @xcite ( e.g. heterogeneous degree distributions and assortative degree correlations ) .",
    "furthermore , the study of the social response to epidemics is interesting from an applied point of view because it could enable enhanced vaccine control @xcite and effective quarantine strategies @xcite .    in comparison to social responses to the epidemics @xcite , direct topological feedback via the removal of nodes",
    "has received less attention .",
    "previous works considered the case where network growth and death processes are balanced and thus the population stays in equilibrium and fluctuates around a fixed system size @xcite . the case of continuous growth",
    "was studied in @xcite , where new nodes attach preferentially to high degree non - infected nodes .",
    "it was observed that a transition from a scale - free topology to an exponential one takes place as the infectiousness decreases . in another study ,",
    "network growth and node removals have been incorporated in a single model @xcite .",
    "however , the authors focused on the epidemic oscillations and did not consider topological effects in detail .",
    "another related work focused on the interplay between network growth and dynamical behaviour in the context of evolutionary game theory @xcite , where new players preferentially attach to those receiving higher payoffs .    here",
    ", we consider the growth of a network by preferential attachment from which nodes are simultaneously removed due to a susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) epidemic .",
    "the appeal of this model lies in its paradoxical nature , in absence of the disease preferential attachment will lead to the formation of scale - free topologies in which the epidemic threshold vanishes , such that the disease can invade .",
    "however , an established sir disease will quickly infect and remove nodes of high degree such that the variance of the degree distribution is decreased and epidemic thresholds reappear , potentially leading to the extinction of the disease .",
    "one can attempt to guess the outcome by the following ( slightly naive ) line of reasoning : observing a scale - free topology implies that the epidemic is extinct .",
    "but an extinct epidemic implies scale - free structure and hence vanishing epidemic threshold precluding extinction .",
    "logically , the only possible solution is that the epidemic persists ( unconditionally ) in a network that is not scale free . in other words",
    ", one would expect that the coevolution of epidemic state and network structure should lead to a vanishing epidemic threshold in an exponential network .",
    "one could argue that the naive reasoning is wrong because the paradox above can be resolved temporally , such that the epidemic goes extinct while the network is exponential , whereas a disease - free scale - free network develops at later times .",
    "subsequently the network can not be re - invaded by the disease because all infected have been removed . however , this temporal resolution is only feasible in finite networks . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "it can be easily shown that a finite number of infected survive even below the epidemic threshold , which precludes complete extinction and thus is sufficient to reignite the epidemic at a later stage .    in the remainder of this paper we present a detailed dynamical analysis of the epidemic model showing that the naive reasoning presented above is actually correct in the thermodynamic limit . here",
    ", high infectiousness elevates the prevalence of the disease but at the same time limits epidemic spreading by causing a transition from scale - free to exponential topologies .",
    "thus a balance is reached where the finite variance of the degree distribution is matched to the finite infectiousness , such that the epidemic persists .",
    "we use a novel analytical approximation scheme to understand this balance in detail , and also identify a small parameter region , where , after all , a temporal resolution of the paradox is observed .",
    "we study the spreading of a susceptible - infected - removed ( sir ) disease @xcite on an evolving network . in this network",
    "a given node is either susceptible ( state s ) or already infected with the disease ( state i ) .",
    "we start with a fully connected network of @xmath0 nodes and consider three dynamical processes : a ) the arrival of nodes , b ) disease transmission , and c ) the removal of nodes .    in the following",
    "we measure all rates per capita , including the arrival rate .",
    "this implies that larger populations have a proportionally larger influx of agents .",
    "this assumption is necessary to keep the model well - defined in the thermodynamic limit and appears plausible e.g.  for growing cities , where the attractivity increases with size .",
    "new nodes arrive in the population at a constant rate @xmath1 and are already infected with the disease with probability @xmath2 . arriving nodes immediately establish links with @xmath3 of the nodes selected according to the preferential attachment rule @xcite : a new node establishes a link with an existing node of degree k with probability @xmath4 , where @xmath5 denotes the degree distribution ( the probability that a randomly picked node has degree @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 is the mean degree .",
    "disease transmission occurs at rate @xmath8 on every link connecting a susceptible and an infected node .",
    "therefore , nodes with higher degree are proportionally more likely to catch and spread the disease .",
    "removal of infected nodes take place at rate @xmath9 . because we describe a fatal disease",
    "from which recovery is not possible , removed nodes and their links are entirely deleted from the simulation and do not re - enter at a later stage .",
    "unless mentioned otherwise , the following set of parameter values is used throughout the paper : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 . in agent - based simulations",
    "the network is simulated until @xmath13 reaches @xmath14 ( the scale of present mega cities ) , or the network has stopped growing and the time reaches @xmath15 .",
    "the dynamics on and of complex networks can be captured by a set of coupled ordinary differential equations , in so - called moment - closure approximations @xcite . here , we develop a heterogeneous node approximation @xcite , where the network evolution is captured in a set of equations for the node densities in different degree - classes .",
    "we define @xmath16 $ ] as the density of nodes of state @xmath17 and degree k among all nodes in the network .",
    "furthermore , the total density of s - nodes is denoted as @xmath18 $ ] , @xmath18=\\sum_{k}[s_{k}]$ ] .",

    "similarly , nodes in the @xmath31 class pass into the @xmath27 class at the rate @xmath32/\\langle k \\rangle$ ] .",
    "additionally , we need to renormalize the density @xmath20 $ ] when a node arrives .",
    "this corresponds to a loss of the @xmath20 $ ] density of @xmath33 $ ] .    at rate @xmath8 ,",
    "nodes within the @xmath27 class become infected through their links with infected nodes causing them to pass into the @xmath34 class .",

    "the finite - size extinction of the epidemic is demonstrated explicitly in figure  [ fig : survivefrac ] , which shows that the fraction of agent - based simulation runs in which the epidemic persists increases with the initial network size @xmath90 .     as a function of the initial network size @xmath90 .",
    "the fraction of surviving runs increases as the initial network size @xmath0 increases . in order to ensure the same initial average degree @xmath3 , the barabsi - albert growth model with @xmath91 and @xmath92",
    "is iterated until the network reaches size @xmath90 .",
    "then nodes are assigned states and the infection , removal , and network growth processes take place simultaneously .",
    "parameters : @xmath57 , @xmath69 , @xmath10 , @xmath58.,width=377 ]    -\\langle k \\rangle$ ] plane for high removal rate @xmath9 . at high infectiousness @xmath8",
    ", the observed behaviour resembles a homoclinic trajectory .",
    "the network grows from a healthy initial state until an infected eventually arrives and the disease quickly spreads over the network and the infected individuals subsequently die .",
    "homogeneous approximation ( red circles ) fails to capture this behaviour and predicts a stable equilibrium .",
    "parameters : @xmath12 , @xmath93 , @xmath10 , @xmath58 , @xmath94.,width=377 ]    precluding the finite - size effect described above , simulation runs in the parameter range considered so far approach a finite prevalence for any positive value of infectiousness .",
    "the paradox outlined above is thus resolved by alternative a ) the model does not have an epidemic threshold although the evolving topologies remain exponential . as a final step in our exploration we now search for evidence of the temporal resolution of the paradox , the alternative b ) .    up to now",
    "we have considered relatively small removal rates @xmath9 . at sufficiently high removal rate ,",
    "the evolution of the disease and the topology exhibits dynamics different from the convergence to a stationary state .",
    "figure  [ fig : approximation_failure ] shows a representative evolution at non - zero fraction of infected arrivals @xmath2 . at the combination of high infectiousness @xmath8 and high removal rate @xmath9 ,",
    "the dynamics resembles a homoclinic trajectory in the @xmath95 $ ] plane .",
    "the disease spreads quickly over the network and it covers the whole population immediately .",
    "then disease - induced removals dominate and the population becomes extinct until new healthy individuals arrive and the disease spreading restarts , which leads to cycles of population growth and collapse .",
    "when all arrivals are susceptible , i.e. @xmath69 , the epidemics in the finite population disappears entirely and the collapse - and - growth cycle can not be completed . a disease - free scale - free network then emerges .",
    "based on the arguments above one can suspect that the same behaviour can not occur in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "instead it is likely that the observed dynamics forms part of a homoclinic cycle , where long phases of very low disease prevalence are disrupted by sharp outbreaks .",
    "similar dynamics have for instance been studied in an adaptive - network model of cooperation among agents @xcite . in the present model , the moment closure approximation fails to capture this behaviour and predicts a stable steady - state solution for high values of @xmath9 .",
    "the observed dynamics at high removal rates would correspond to diseases with very high mortality where infected individuals die almost immediately .",
    "this is reminiscent of the massive pandemics in history , where humanity was exposed to new pathogens with very high virulence .",
    "while such diseases could lead to the deaths of large fractions of populations , continuous supply of healthy individuals through immigration provided new hosts to the disease and introduced new bursts of disease spreading which caused repeated epidemics cycles .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated the dynamics of a fatal disease in a growing population .",
    "our main finding is that no epidemic threshold exists in this model although the variance of the degree distribution remains finite .",
    "thus even in evolving exponential network topologies  unlikely \" diseases with very low infectiousness can persist indefinitely .",
    "we presented a detailed analytical exploration for the case of low removal rate , where the prevalence of the disease reaches a stationary level . in the growing population",
    "the ongoing epidemic dynamics eliminates the nodes of high degree and thus leads to the formation of exponential topologies for which the variance of the degree distribution is finite .",
    "however , this mechanism only reduces the width of the degree distribution so far that the epidemic can still persist .",
    "thus for any finite value of the infectiousness the network adapts its topology such that the variance of the degree distribution is lower to point where the epidemic can still be sustained , which explains the observed absence of the epidemic threshold .    when the removal rate is sufficiently high , we observed a much more dynamic picture , where degree variance acts as a supply of fuel that slowly builds up before being burned in large epidemic outbreaks .",
    "these dynamics are reminiscent of the massive deaths from epidemic diseases in newly forming urban areas .",
    "a detailed analysis thus appears as a promising target for future work .",
    "the dynamical feedback between the population structure and the epidemic disease has been so far studied in a number of articles in the past five years @xcite .",
    "however , models captured mostly social interactions in non - fatal diseases . a significant obstacle to progress in this line of work is that the network evolution in most models is driven by behavioural changes of individuals ( whom to meet , how often to wash hands ) .",
    "however , for behaviour often no records exist such that model predictions can not easily be compared with real world data .",
    "by contrast , in the model proposed here , the social network evolves due to demographic processes such as migration and death on which data may be easier to obtain .",
    "we believe that the proposed model is relevant for epidemics in rapidly growing cities , especially in the developing countries .",
    "we hope that in this context connecting the model to real world data will be feasible in the future .",
    "one can easily imagine extensions of the present model that incorporate policy measures such as vaccination , quarantine , or regulation of migration .",
    "we hope that this will in the future lead to the formulation of more efficient policies for combating epidemic diseases .",
