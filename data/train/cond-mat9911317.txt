    "in this contribution we present a novel study of chaos and anomalous diffusion in the dynamics of the single - particle motion in the hamiltonian mean field ( hmf ) model .",
    "this model describes n classical particles moving on the unit circle and interacting through an infinite range potential .",
    "it has been recently studied both analitycally and numerically  @xcite . at low energy the particles",
    "are clustered and , as the energy is increased , the system undergoes a second - order phase transition , reaching a high temperature  gaseous \" phase where the particles are homogeneously distributed on the circle . the motion is chaotic and the lyapunov exponent reaches a maximum at the critical point .",
    "particle motion is superdiffusive for a range of energies close to the critical point , but only in a transient quasi - stationary regime preceeding equilibration .",
    "particles can evaporate from the cluster showing lvy walks .",
    "close to the critical point , if the continuum ( @xmath0 ) limit is performed before the @xmath1 limit , canonical equilibrium is never reached and quasi - stationary superdiffusive states live forever  @xcite .",
    "though anomalous diffusion and lvy walks have been widely studied in the recent literature in models with a few degrees of freedom  @xcite , there are very few studies for many - degrees - of - freedom systems  @xcite .",
    "the hmf model has the advantage of having an exact solution in the canonical ensemble , and therefore microscopic dynamics can be put in connection to macroscopic features , thus offering a very interesting perspective  @xcite .    in the following sections we remind the reader the details of the model and then we discuss superdiffusion in connection to microscopic chaotic dynamics .",
    "hmf describes a system of @xmath2 classical particles moving on a circle , characterized by the angles @xmath3 and the conjugate momenta @xmath4 .",
    "each particle interact with all the others according to the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6\\ ] ]    are the kinetic and potential energy . if we define a spin vector associated to each particle @xmath7 $ ] and",
    "a total magnetization @xmath8 the hamiltonian then describes @xmath2 classical fully coupled spins , similarly to the xy model . with this interpretation ,",
    "the system is a ferromagnet at low energy   and shows a second - order phase transition  at the critical energy   @xmath9 ( corresponding to the critical temperature @xmath10 in the canonical ensemble )  @xcite ) .",
    "we show in fig.1 the total magnetization vs. energy @xmath11 .",
    "numerical simulations ( dots ) are compared with the canonical ensemble result ( full line ) .",
    "pictorial views of the low energy ferromagnetic ( clustered ) phase and high energy paramagnetic ( gaseous ) phases are shown in the insets .",
    "the equations of motion for the @xmath2 particles are @xmath12 where @xmath13 are respectively the modulus and the phase of the total magnetization vector @xmath14 .",
    "these equations are formally equivalent to those of a perturbed pendulum . to study relaxation to canonical equilibrium , we solve these equations on the computer using fourth order symplectic algorithms ( the details can be found in refs  @xcite ) .",
    "we start the system in a given initial state and we compute @xmath15 at each time step , and from them the total magnetization @xmath16 and temperature @xmath17 ( through the relation @xmath18 ) .",
    "we consider systems with an increasing size @xmath2 and different energies @xmath11 .",
    "the single - particle motion is given by eq .",
    "(  [ eqmoto ] ) , if we consider the mean - field pair @xmath13 as an _ external _ time dependent forcing . in the next section",
    "we focus our attention on the dynamics of the single - particle motion and we show that it is chaotic and superdiffusive .",
    "in this section we discuss the numerical results . in fig .",
    "2 we show single - particle phase spaces for three different energies : below ( 2a ) , close to ( 2b ) and above ( 2c ) the critical energy @xmath19 . while for @xmath20 the particle never escapes the cluster and moves on the chaotic web near the center of the nonlinear resonance , close to the critical point ( at @xmath21 ) it escapes frequently from the cluster and is then trapped again , exhibiting the well known phenomenon of _ separatrix crossing_. above the critical energy one has mainly a ballistic regime , separatrix crossings are rarely observed and particles interact very weakly .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "3 the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath22 for the single - particle motion as a function of the total energy per particle .",
    "the motion is chaotic and has a peak at the critical point , but @xmath22 is much smaller than the largest lyapunov exponent calculated for the full dynamics in refs .",
    "the reason is that in the calculation of the lyapunov of the full system one gets the additional contribution to the instability of the off - diagonal terms of the jacobian .",
    "we show in the inset a log - log plot with a fit at energies less than @xmath23 , which is a power law , i.e. @xmath24 ; again quite far from the @xmath25 law found for the full dynamics .",
    "a very weak @xmath2 dependence is present is this region . in the high energy region @xmath22",
    "vanishes with @xmath2 , with the  universal \" law @xmath26 , which is found in many different contexts  @xcite .",

    "all the processes with @xmath32 are termed anomalous diffusion , namely subdiffusion for @xmath33 and superdiffusion for @xmath34 .    in order to study anomalous diffusion in hmf",

    "we compute the variance of the one - particle angle @xmath36 according to the expression @xmath37 where @xmath38 indicates the average over the @xmath2 particles , and we fit the value of the exponent @xmath39 in eq .",

    "the exponent @xmath39 differs from 1 , as it should be for normal diffusion , and takes values close to 1.4 .",
    "one has therefore superdiffusion , which however turns again into normal after a crossover time .",
    "this behavior does not seem to depend strongly on energy , although the superdiffusion exponent @xmath39 is slightly energy dependent . in ref .  @xcite we have shown that this crossover time coincides with the equilibration one and that by using the model of ref .",

    "superdiffusion is present in a transient out - of - equilibrium regime for energies close to the critical one , where the system is strongly chaotic and quasi - stationary states exist .",
    "the crossover time from enhanced diffusion to normal coincides with the equilibration time which diverges with @xmath2 .",
    "this is true for fully coupled systems , but should appear also if the interaction decays with the distance among the particles with a power law  @xcite .",
