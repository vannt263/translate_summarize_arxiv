    "currently , thousands of exoplanets with diverse characteristics have been detected @xcite .",
    "arguably , one of the most important reasons for studying them is to determine whether they could be habitable .",
    "the habitable zone ( hz ) is broadly defined as the region around a star where a planet can support liquid water for certain values of the atmospheric pressure @xcite , and has been extensively investigated ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as per current estimates , it is expected that there are @xmath0 earth - sized planets that lie within the hz of their stars , in the milky way @xcite .",
    "most of the attention has focused on hz studies of exoplanets around m - dwarfs for two reasons : ( i ) earth - sized planets in the hz are quite common @xcite , and ( ii ) detailed characterizations of their atmospheres are easier since they are situated much closer to the host star @xcite .",
    "hence , there have been numerous hz studies of m - dwarf exoplanets @xcite .",
    "this area received a major impetus recently with the potential discovery of a super - earth ( a planet slightly larger than the earth ) orbiting proxima centauri @xcite , which was christened proxima centauri b ( pcb ) .",
    "the result is significant because proxima centauri is the nearest star to the earth , and plans are already underway for exploring pcb .",
    "exoplanetary atmospheres are an important area of research since spectroscopic analyses can potentially reveal the presence of life via biosignatures @xcite .",
    "this raises an important question : at what rates are the atmospheres of close - in exoplanets ( such as those in the hz of m - dwarfs ) eroded by the stellar wind ? the question is of paramount importance , as high escape rates might deplete the planet of its atmosphere after a short period of time , if one excludes mechanisms such as outgassing @xcite .    in our own solar system , the importance of atmospheric loss mechanisms has been thoroughly documented for mars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the primary scientific goals of nasa s mars atmosphere and volatile evolution ( maven ) mission is to determine the escape rates , which are crucial because of their potential impact on the long - term evolution of the martian atmosphere ( e.g. , loss of water ) . @xcite",
    "estimated a net ion escape rate of @xmath12.5 @xmath2 10@xmath3 s@xmath4 by choosing a spherical shell at @xmath11000 km above the planet with energies @xmath525 ev over a 4-month maven period .",
    "the ion loss increases by more than one order of magnitude during interplanetary corona mass ejection events @xcite .    there exist several papers that have explored atmospheric losses from hz exoplanets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , some of which relied upon _ hydrodynamic _ models . as we have learned from our solar system ,",
    "realistic estimates appear to necessitate sophisticated _ magnetohydrodynamical _ ( mhd ) models for studying the stellar wind - exoplanet interaction , especially for earth - sized ( or above ) planets where neutral losses ( e.g. , thermal and photochemical escape ) are not the dominant mechanism @xcite .",
    "such studies have been quite sparse in exoplanetary research as they necessitate highly detailed numerical codes .",
    "however , recent publications ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on magnetized and unmagnetized exoplanets are notable for tackling this issue .    in this letter , we investigate atmospheric losses arising from stellar wind interaction with a planet that has pcb - like parameters .",
    "since pcb may lack a magnetic field @xcite , we examine both the magnetized and unmagnetized cases .",
    "although our final results are outwardly simple , we note that this interaction process is actually highly complex in nature .",
    "our model self - consistently accounts for the ionospheric chemistries and electromagnetic forces @xcite .",
    "in this section , we describe our code , and the rationale behind our choices of the parameters .",
    "the 3-d block adaptive tree solar - wind roe upwind scheme ( bats - r - us ) multi - species mhd ( ms - mhd ) model was initially developed for mars @xcite and venus @xcite .",
    "the latter is employed herein , and the neutral atmospheric profiles are based on the solar maximum conditions . the ms - mhd model solves a separate continuity equation for each ion species , and one momentum and one energy equation for the four ion fluids h@xmath6 , o@xmath6 , o@xmath7 , co@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most global magnetosphere models applied to earth that start from @xmath8-@xmath9 earth radii , the mars / venus ms - mhd model contains a self - consistent ionosphere , and thus the lower boundary extends down to 100 km altitude above the planetary surface .",
    "the ms - mhd model includes ionospheric chemical processes such as charge exchange and photoionization .",
    "the chemical reactions and rate coefficients are based on @xcite , except the photoionization rates ; the latter are rescaled to pcb values based on the euv estimate in @xcite .",
    "the o@xmath6 , o@xmath7 , co@xmath7 ion densities at the model lower boundary ( i.e. , on the 100 km altitude sphere ) satisfy the photochemical equilibrium condition , where float boundary conditions for the velocity @xmath10 and the magnetic field @xmath11 have been applied .",
    "given the high collision frequency near the inner boundary , ions , electrons and neutrals are expected to have roughly the same temperature .",
    "thus , the plasma temperature ( sum of ion and electron temperatures ) is twice the neutral temperature .    as this code is capable of handling a wide array of chemical and physical processes , and",
    "has been thoroughly benchmarked and validated for venus and mars , we use it for studying the ion escape rates of pcb . as a consequence ,",
    "we assume that the atmospheric composition of pcb is similar to that of venus and mars . in reality , we wish to note there are many possibilities for the atmospheric composition of pcb , provided that it even exists @xcite . a clearer picture regarding the existence and composition of the atmosphere may emerge via the jwst @xcite .    in the model , a nonuniform ,",

    "if we assume that only the gravity changes , the scale height of pcb is @xmath50 and we will express all quantities in terms of the venusian values detailed in @xcite , since the code was calibrated for venus . the second parameter required as an input is the density at the base of the model , which requires the surface atmospheric pressure , p@xmath51 .",

    "furthermore , the scale height of n@xmath27 at 100 km is about 5.8 km which is close to the scale height of co@xmath27 for venus at 100 km , before rescaling it to account for the higher gravity of pcb .",
    "therefore , the reconstructed neutral atmosphere mimics certain features of earth s atmosphere .",
    "the sensitivity of our results to the atmospheric pressure is evaluated by also considering the case with venusian surface pressure ( @xmath57 bar ) .",

    "[ bandu ] . as seen from fig .",

    "2 ) although c1-m has a global dipole magnetic field , the dipole field strength is not strong enough to fully protect the exoplanet from the stellar wind interaction due to the enormous stellar wind dynamic pressure , and the southward stellar wind b@xmath74 that enables dayside magnetic reconnection .",
    "3 ) closed dipole field lines are observed for c2-m , and not c1-m , because the value of p@xmath40 for case 2 ( @xmath1 5 @xmath2 10@xmath75 np ) is five times smaller than that of case 1 ( @xmath1 2.5 @xmath2 10@xmath76 np ) .",
    "4 ) in both c1-m and c2-m , the polar cap regions ( i.e. , the regions poleward of the auroral oval , @xcite , pp .",
    "26 ) are greatly extended to lower latitudes compared to that of the earth .",
    "thus , the escape rates in both cases are expected to be larger than the typical values observed in our solar system .",
    "interestingly , the ionospheric profiles , especially the heavy ions o@xmath7 and co@xmath7 , are not significantly affected by the stellar wind conditions @xmath77 200 km ( i.e. , the photochemical region ) regardless of the stellar wind total pressure - see fig .",
    "[ iono ] . the slight increase in o@xmath6 density ( in both panels of fig .",
    "[ iono ] ) results from the charge exchange ( see table [ table1 ] ) with the enhanced penetrating stellar wind protons ( not shown in the plot ) .    from table",
    "[ table3 ] , we see that the total escape rates for the unmagnetized cases are @xmath78/sec . as expected from fig .",
    "[ bandu ] , the ion escape rates for c1-unm and c1-m are similar , although the dipole fields are responsible for reducing the total ion losses to some extent . however , the total ion escape rate for the magnetized case c2-m ( compared to c2-unm ) is decreased by about one order of magnitude ( mainly caused by decrease in o@xmath6 ) and is on the order of @xmath79/sec .",
    "this is consistent with the notion that a global dipole magnetic field protects venus - like exoplanets from the stellar wind to some extent , although the final rates are still _ higher _ than those observed in our solar system .",
    "but , this conclusion is not necessarily valid for exoplanets with different sizes , neutral atmosphere profiles and stellar wind parameters .    in fig .",
    "[ iono ] , co@xmath7 is one of the major ion species in the pcb s ionosphere as a direct consequence of the photoionization of co@xmath27 .",
    "however , co@xmath7 quickly reacts with neutral o to produce mostly o@xmath7 which becomes the other major ion at a similar altitude as co@xmath7 . due to the large scale height of neutral o ( because of the lighter mass ) , the o@xmath6 ionospheric peak is located at a relatively high altitude , and is thus picked up first by the stellar wind . due to momentum conservation , if the stellar wind picks up a large number of light ions , it can not pick up too many heavy ions .",
    "in addition , the electromagnetic shielding caused by the high - altitude ionized o@xmath6 ions ( e.g , as a conductor layer ) also helps in preventing the stellar wind and imf from penetrating deeply into the planetary ionosphere and picking up the heavy ions .",
    "this helps explain why there are _ higher _ o@xmath6 but _ lower _ heavy ion losses in c1-unm@xmath69 , as compared to c1-unm .",
    "c1-unm@xmath69 is the unmagnetized case with the venusian surface pressure of @xmath57 bar instead of the earth value of @xmath52 bar with the scale height chosen in accordance with ( [ schpcb ] ) .",
    "overall , the total ion escape rate does not change too much , indicating that the surface pressure does not significantly affect the ion escape rates under extreme stellar wind conditions .",
    "in contrast to our preceding discussion , it is noteworthy that the terrestrial planets in our solar system exhibit loss rates that are typically @xmath110@xmath68/sec @xcite .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that approximately @xmath80 of the atmospheric oxygen had been lost over 3 billion years on earth . as the escape losses for proxima centauri b ( pcb ) in the _ unmagnetized _ case are about two orders of magnitude higher , all of the atmosphere could be depleted much faster - possibly in a span of @xmath81 years . in turn , this has very important ramifications for surface - based life - as - we - know - it , given the importance of elements such as oxygen @xcite .",
    "if gases such as oxygen are depleted on these short timescales , sufficient time may not exist for complex life to evolve .",
    "our simulations indicate that the escape rates for pcb in the _ magnetized _ case are higher than that of the earth , implying that some of the above conclusions for the unmagnetized case are also valid here .",
    "but , it is equally important to recognize that the magnetized case is quite sensitive to the values of the stellar wind parameters ( see table [ table3 ] ) .",
    "the atmosphere depletion could occur over @xmath81 and @xmath82 years for c1-m and c2-m , respectively .",
    "thus , our results appear to indicate that pcb , and other similar m - dwarf exoplanets , are not generally capable of supporting an atmosphere over long ( gyr ) timescales in both the unmagnetized or magnetized cases when the total stellar wind pressure is _",
    "high_. in contrast , for lower values of the pressure , the magnetized case can potentially sustain an atmosphere over gyr timescales .",
    "it has been widely established that the hz of m - dwarfs evolves over time @xcite .",
    "if the stellar wind pressure was higher at earlier epochs , this would have led to increased escape rates .",
    "hence , even with a dipole field , the atmosphere may be eroded on sub - gyr timescales .",
    "we have also demonstrated that the ionospheric profiles ( especially the heavy ions o@xmath7 and co@xmath7 ) are mostly unaffected by the stellar wind conditions at @xmath77 200 km .",
    "this is important because the stellar wind pressure is highly variable , as noted in @xcite .",
    "hence , the fact that the stellar wind variability does not greatly influence the lower regions lends some credence to the hypothesis that the surface biology may not be significantly affected @xcite .",
    "there are some important caveats , with regards to the above conclusions , that must be reiterated at this stage .",
    "most of the parameters for pcb and proxima centauri are currently unknown .",
    "the composition and thickness of the atmosphere could be different , enabling the retention of the atmosphere over longer periods of time .",
    "the existence of processes , such as outgassing which occurs on titan @xcite , may counteract the atmospheric losses by serving as _",
    "sources_. thus , a complete understanding of this problem necessitates a knowledge of both source and loss mechanisms .",
    "our model does not include kinetic processes , which contribute to the ion loss mechanisms @xcite .    finally , as observed in sec .",
    "[ secintro ] , there are @xmath0 exoplanets in the hz around m - dwarfs .",
    "thus , even if our parameter choices are invalidated by future observations of pcb , these values would , in all likelihood , be valid for other m - dwarf hz exoplanets whose parameters are similar to the ones considered herein .",
    "to summarize , this letter sheds light on atmospheric losses from m - dwarf exoplanets in the hz such as pcb , and clearly delineates the role of the planetary magnetic field and the stellar wind parameters .",
    "we have shown that venus - like exoplanets ( with pcb - like parameters ) are characterized by high escape rates in the unmagnetized limit , but these values are reduced to an extent when a dipole magnetic field exists .",
    "hence , pcb may undergo significant atmospheric erosion over gyr timescales in both the magnetized and unmagnetized cases , but this statement must be taken with due caution since there are many inherent uncertainties .",
    "future missions such as jwst will be essential in placing constraints on stellar winds and exoplanet atmospheres , thereby paving the way for more accurate estimations of atmospheric losses .",
