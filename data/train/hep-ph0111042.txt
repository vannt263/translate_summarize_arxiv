    "<S> if , on the other hand , larger ultrahigh energy neutrino fluxes on the level of the upper limit from `` hidden '' hadronic astrophysical sources are realized in nature , then the first signs of black hole production may be observed at auger . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in this case , the fly s eye constraints , although more model - dependent , turn out to be competitive with other currently available constraints on tev - scale gravity which are mainly based on interactions associated with kaluza - klein gravitons .    </S>",
