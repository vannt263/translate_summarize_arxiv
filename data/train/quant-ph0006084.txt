    "the mechanical interaction between a moving mirror and a radiation field has been an important topic for the study of very high precision optical interferometers in which radiation pressure effects can not be ignored .",
    "this interaction is at the basis of the interferometric detection of gravitational waves , where the tiny displacement of a mirror can be detected as a phase shift of the interference fringes @xcite .",
    "another interesting application is the atomic force microscope @xcite , where an image of a surface at atomic resolution is obtained from the measurement of the force between the surface and a probe tip mounted on a microcantilever .",
    "a cavity with a movable mirror is of interest also for cavity qed studies , which usually involves the quantum coherent interaction between high - q cavity modes at low photon number and single atoms . in this case , the atomic degrees of freedom are replaced by the motional degree of freedom of the movable mirror .",
    "interesting quantum effects , as the generation of sub - poissonian light @xcite , of schrdinger cat states of both the cavity mode @xcite and even of the mirror @xcite have been already illustrated .    in these applications",
    "one needs a very high resolution for position measurements and a good control of the various noise sources , because one has to detect the effect of a very weak force . as shown by the pioneering work of braginsky @xcite ,",
    "even though all classical noise sources had been minimized , the detection of gravitational waves would be ultimately determined by quantum fluctuations and the heisenberg uncertainty principle .",
    "quantum noise in interferometers has two fundamental sources , the photon shot noise of the laser beam , prevailing at low laser intensity , and the fluctuations of the mirror position due to radiation pressure , which is proportional to the incident laser power .",
    "this radiation pressure noise is the so - called `` back - action noise '' arising from the fact that intensity fluctuations affect the momentum fluctuations of the mirror , which are then fed back into the position by the dynamics of the mirror .",
    "the two quantum noises are minimized at an optimal , intermediate , laser power , yielding the so - called _ standard quantum limit _ ( sql ) , which coincides with mean square fluctuations of the harmonic oscillator ground state @xmath0 ( @xmath1 is the mirror oscillation frequency ) .",
    "real devices constructed up to now are still far from the standard quantum limit because quantum noise is much smaller than that of classical origin , which is essentially given by thermal noise .",
    "in fact , present interferometric gravitational wave detectors are limited by the brownian motion of the suspended mirrors @xcite , which can be decomposed into suspension and internal ( i.e. of internal acoustic modes ) thermal noise .",
    "therefore it is very important to establish the experimental limitations determined by thermal noise and recent experiments @xcite have obtained interesting results . with this respect",
    "it is also important to establish which is the most appropriate formal description of quantum brownian motion .",
    "in fact , even though the classical understanding of the phenomenon is well established , relying on langevin or fokker - planck equations @xcite , its quantum generalization is still the subject of an intense debate ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in particular , the recent paper by jacobs _",
    "@xcite has shown that the standard description of quantum brownian motion , which is the straightforward generalization of the classical case @xcite , gives an inadequate description since it generates a non - sensical term in the optical phase noise spectrum in the case of a cavity with a movable mirror .",
    "the authors of @xcite adopt therefore a corrected quantum langevin equation , based on the disi master equation @xcite , and suggest that , even if it is quite challenging , the corresponding modifications of the phase noise spectrum could be revealed using miniature high - frequency mechanical oscillators and ultra - low temperatures . in the present paper",
    "we shall reconsider the same system , i.e. a driven cavity with a movable mirror , and shall show that the inadequacy shown in @xcite has to be traced back to the inadequacy of the quantum noise commutation relations and correlation functions which are dictated by the standard brownian motion master equation .",
    "we shall see that , differently from the master equation approach , a consistently applied quantum langevin equation @xcite provides a flexible approach , valid at _ any temperature _ and therefore also in the fully quantum regime of very low temperatures .",
    "this however does not mean that the quantum langevin equation approach is generally superior than the master equation approach , but simply that in the case under study , which is a linearized , non - markovian problem , the quantum langevin description is more convenient and powerful .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the appropriate quantum langevin equations for a brownian particle are derived starting from the usual model based on the coupling with a reservoir of harmonic oscillator , and its consistency is shown . in sec .",
    "iii the quantum langevin approach is applied to the case of a cavity mode with a movable mirror and the homodyne spectrum of the reflected light , showing the thermal and quantum fluctuations of the mirror , is studied .",
    "iv is for concluding remarks .",
    "the system studied in the present paper consists of a coherently driven optical cavity with a moving mirror .",
    "this opto - mechanical system can represent one arm of an interferometer able to detect weak forces as those associated with gravitational waves @xcite or an atomic force microscope @xcite .",
    "the detection of very weak forces requires having quantum limited devices , whose sensitivity is ultimately determined by the quantum fluctuations . for this reason we shall describe the mirror as a _",
    "quantum _ mechanical harmonic oscillator with mass @xmath2 and frequency @xmath1 . the optomechanical coupling between the mirror and the cavity field is realized by the radiation pressure .",
    "the electromagnetic field exerts a force on the movable mirror which is proportional to the intensity of the field , which , at the same time , is phase - shifted by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the wave vector and @xmath5 is the mirror displacement from the equilibrium position . in the adiabatic limit",
    "in which the mirror frequency is much smaller than the cavity free spectral range @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the cavity length ) @xcite , one can focus on one cavity mode only because photon scattering into other modes can be neglected , and one has the following hamiltonian @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the cavity mode annihilation operator with optical frequency @xmath10 and @xmath11 describes the coherent input field with frequency @xmath12 driving the cavity . the quantity @xmath11",
    "is related to the input laser power @xmath13 by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the cavity decay constant due to the input coupling mirror . since we shall focus on the quantum and thermal noise of the system",
    ", we shall neglect all the experimental sources of noise , i.e. , we shall assume that the driving laser is stabilized in intensity and frequency .",
    "this means neglecting all the fluctuations of the complex parameter @xmath11 . including these supplementary noise sources is however quite straightforward and a detailed calculation of their effect is shown in ref .",
    "moreover recent experiments have shown that classical laser noise can be made negligible in the relevant frequency range @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic regime @xmath16 we have assumed in eq .",
    "( [ hparte ] ) implies @xmath17 , and therefore the generation of photons due to the casimir effect , and also retardation and doppler effects are completely negligible .",
    "the dynamics of the system is not only determined by the hamiltonian interaction ( [ hparte ] ) , but also by the dissipative interaction with external degrees of freedom .",
    "the cavity mode is damped due to the photon leakage through the mirrors which couple the cavity mode with the continuum of the outside electromagnetic modes .",
    "for simplicity we assume that the movable mirror has perfect reflectivity and that transmission takes place through the other `` fixed '' mirror only ( see fig .  1 for a schematic description of the system ) .",
    "the mechanical oscillator , which may represent not only the center - of - mass degree of freedom of the mirror , but also a torsional degree of freedom as in @xcite , or an internal acoustic mode as in @xcite , undergoes brownian motion caused by the uncontrolled coupling with other internal and external modes at the equilibrium temperature @xmath18 .",
    "the dissipative dynamics of the optical cavity mode is well described by the so - called vacuum optical master equation @xcite @xmath19 for the time evolution of the density matrix of the whole system @xmath20 .",
    "in fact , the mean thermal number of photons at the optical frequency @xmath21 is extremely small and thermal excitation is therefore completely negligible .",
    "the time evolution generated by eq .",
    "( [ vome ] ) presents no ambiguity .",
    "in fact it is of lindblad form @xcite and therefore it preserves the positivity of the density matrix .",
    "moreover it is completely equivalent to the time evolution for the operators in the heisenberg representation driven by the following quantum langevin equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the input noise operator associated with the vacuum fluctuations of the continuum of modes outside the cavity , having the following commutation relation @xmath24=\\delta(t - t ' ) \\label{commu}\\ ] ] and correlation functions @xmath25    the description of the quantum brownian motion of a massive particle in a potential is instead not so well established .",
    "the standard brownian motion master equation ( sbmme ) has been first derived by caldeira and leggett @xcite in the high temperature limit and reads @xmath26 -\\frac{i\\eta}{2 m \\hbar}\\left[q(t),\\ { p(t ) , \\rho(t ) \\}\\right ]   -\\frac{\\eta kt}{\\hbar^{2 } } \\left[q(t ) , [ q(t ) , \\rho(t ) ] \\right ] , \\label{cl}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the uncoupled particle hamiltonian , @xmath28 is its momentum and @xmath29 is the friction force .",
    "this master equation is the direct generalization of the fokker - planck equation for the classical brownian motion but , since it is not of lindblad form , it has the drawback that it does not ensure the positivity of the density operator @xcite",
    ". this fact has stimulated many authors who have amended the sbmme with additional terms so to cast it into the lindblad form @xcite .",
    "these corrected master equations preserve the positivity of the density matrix but also them are valid in the high temperature limit only , as the sbmme , because they necessarily provide a markovian description of brownian motion which instead becomes highly non - markovian in the low temperature limit @xcite .",
    "in fact , in this limit , the reservoir correlation time is no more negligible because it is essentially determined by the `` thermal time '' @xmath30 .",
    "an alternative description of quantum brownian motion is provided by the quantum langevin equations for the heisenberg operators @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which , in analogy with the classical case , should read @xmath33   \\label{qleqbm0}\\\\ \\dot{p}(t)&=&\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[h_{\\cal",

    "@xcite has shown that they give inconsistent results even in this limit because they do not preserve the commutation relation @xmath36=i\\hbar$ ] and they yield a spurious term in the phase fluctuation spectrum .",
    "in fact , in spectral measurements , the fourier transform of correlation functions of the form @xmath37 are measured , where @xmath38 is an appropriate output field .",
    "this correlation function depends only on @xmath39 because of stationarity , and moreover it is an even function of @xmath39 because @xmath38 commutes with itself at different times .",
    "this implies that the observed spectrum has to be an _ even _ function of the frequency @xmath40 , while the adoption of the quantum langevin equations ( [ qleqbm0])-([qleqbm ] ) yields a term which is an",
    "_ odd _ function of @xmath41 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite these inadequacies of the quantum langevin equations ( [ qleqbm0])-([qleqbm ] ) have been traced back to the fact that they are equivalent to the sbmme ( [ cl ] ) , which is not of lindblad form and therefore does not preserve positivity .",
    "for this reason they consider the amended master equation of the lindblad form proposed by disi in @xcite , and derive the set of quantum langevin equation equivalent to it , @xmath42 + \\epsilon ( t)\\\\ \\dot{p}(t)&=&\\frac{i}{\\hbar}\\left[h_{\\cal   s},p(t)\\right]-\\frac{\\eta}{m}p(t ) + \\xi(t ) \\ ; , \\label{qledio}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] having the additional noise term @xmath43 .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions are @xmath44 it is then possible to see that the phase noise spectrum associated with this dynamical description of quantum brownian motion has no spurious term and that it is an even function of the frequency , as it must be .",
    "however , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite can be questioned for two reasons .",
    "first of all the master equation of ref .",
    "@xcite has been derived by disi with heuristic arguments and in a later paper @xcite disi himself corrected it by considering a more rigorous medium temperatures extension of the sbmme .",
    "the master equation of ref .",
    "@xcite would lead to a different set of quantum langevin equations ; more generally speaking , the lindblad form condition does not uniquely determine the master equation , and therefore the form of the quantum langevin equations neither .",
    "furthermore , the added noise term @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ qledio0 ] ) is not present in the classical case and it has an unclear physical origin .",
    "for this reason we reconsider here the problem , assuming a different starting point .",
    "most of the derivations of the brownian motion master equations are based on the independent oscillator model for the reservoir , whose quite general validity has been extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , rather than first deriving the master equation from this reservoir model and then considering the quantum langevin equations associated to it , we derive the quantum langevin equations directly from the reservoir oscillator model , as it is shown in @xcite .",
    "let us neglect for the moment the presence of the cavity mode and consider a particle undergoing brownian motion , with hamiltonian @xmath27 .",

    "@xcite coincides with the high temperature expansion ( at first order in @xmath133 ) of eq .",
    "( [ terzo19 ] ) except for the additional factor @xmath134 .",
    "however , in typical experiments , mechanical oscillators with a very good quality factor are always used , so that the term @xmath135 will be in practice always negligible with respect to @xmath136 in eq .",
    "( [ compar ] ) .",
    "this means that an appreciable discrepancy between the two expressions of the thermal noise term manifests itself only when @xmath137 , which means prohibitively small temperatures , or alternatively , very large frequencies ( larger than 1 thz at liquid he temperatures ) .",

    "( [ terzo19 ] ) is important because it shows that the standard quantum langevin equations ( supplemented with the appropriate commutation relations ( [ secondo6 ] ) and correlation functions ( [ primo16])-([primo18 ] ) of the random langevin force ) do give an adequate description of quantum brownian motion , which is even more general than that associated with the master equation , which is not valid at very low temperatures .",
    "we have considered in this paper the dynamics of a cavity mode with a movable mirror , which is often used for the interferometric detection of very weak forces .",
    "we have focused in particular on the description of the quantum brownian motion of the mirror , which is responsible for the thermal noise term in the measured phase noise spectrum of the light reflected from the cavity .",
    "we have shown that the standard quantum langevin equations ( [ qleqbm0])-([qleqbm ] ) provide an adequate and consistent description of quantum brownian motion .",
    "we have derived the quantum langevin equations directly from the independent oscillator model ( providing the commonly used description for the oscillator reservoir , see @xcite ) , and we have seen that they provide a quite general description of quantum brownian motion , valid at any temperatures .",
    "this is instead not true for master equation - based approaches , which can not be applied in the low - temperature limit @xcite .",
    "the inadequacies found in the quantum langevin approach are to be traced back to the fact that the quantum langevin force appearing in it is different from the standard input noise terms of the input - output formalism @xcite , since it is characterized by a different commutation relation ( see eq .",
