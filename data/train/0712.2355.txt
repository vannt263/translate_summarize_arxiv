    "the top quark is unique among the so - far - discovered matter constituents : it is the only fermion whose mass is very close to the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) , @xmath3 , and therefore it has a naturally strong coupling , @xmath4 , to the higgs boson in the standard model .",
    ", with somewhat less inspirational effects .",
    "] it is because of this large coupling , for instance , that the higgs mass can be predicted via precision measurements , and the higgs can be copiously produced at hadron colliders operating at the tev scale , via its top - loop mediated interactions to gluons .",
    "thanks to its large mass , the top quark has also been exploited in many scenarios that go beyond the standard model ( bsm ) .",
    "the simplest one is susy , where top has the important role of triggering ewsb and the historical merit of having escorted the mssm to the lhc era by allowing the higgs mass to survive to the lep bounds .",
    "top has also been the source of inspiration for many alternative mechanisms of ewsb , where it has a direct or indirect role in the boson as well as fermion mass generation : topcolor  @xcite , top see - saw  @xcite and other refinements  @xcite .",
    "more recently , in other theoretical constructions that aim at the stabilization of the higgs mass , the presence of the top quark requires a mechanism that compensates for its large ( negative ) radiative corrections to the higgs mass . in general such mechanisms",
    "entail the existence of new particles , _",
    "i.e. _ , top partners , that can be scalars , like in susy , as well as fermions , like in the little higgs  @xcite or models with extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "in addition , in many such models gauge interactions exist whose coupling with the third generation quarks and in particular to the top quark are enhanced .",
    "these include kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the graviton  @xcite as well as the weak  @xcite and the strong gauge bosons  @xcite which couple to top quarks .",
    "such particles could show up as resonances in the @xmath5 production channel and not in other channels , like di - jets or di - leptons , due to their small couplings to light particles .    if on the one hand , the fact that many rich and theoretically motivated models predict new physics in connection with the top quark provides a strong motivation for detailed experimental investigations , on the other it makes difficult to perform the analyses corresponding to all the suggested scenarios .",
    "a way to avoid such an `` explosion '' of models is a bottom - up approach , where first a physical observable , which carries some potential for bsm studies , is identified and then the effects due to the existence of new physics are systematically explored .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present such a model independent approach to the discovery and identification of new physics in @xmath6 , the top - antitop invariant mass distribution .",
    "we do not focus on specific models , instead we assume the existence of heavy particles , whose masses and quantum numbers are unknown but are such that interactions with the top quark are privileged , a feature common to many scenarios where the top quark plays a role in the ewsb , as discussed above . to simulate the physics associated with the new states , we have developed a dedicated `` model '' in the multipurpose monte carlo generator madgraph / madevent  @xcite .",
    "the strategies and the difficulties associated to the accuracy which will be needed for the reconstruction of @xmath6 have been the subject of several investigations  @xcite and are left to dedicated experimental studies .",
    "however , we briefly comment on them in appendix a.    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : sm ] , we perform an analysis of the theoretical uncertainties on the qcd predictions for @xmath6 , in the low- as well as high - mass regions . we find that the shape of the @xmath6 distribution has very little theoretical uncertainties ( in contrast to its normalization , _",
    "i.e. _ , the total cross section ) and we argue it could provide a new handle on the top mass determination .",
    "in sections  [ sec : bsm ] , [ sec : spin_info ] and  [ sec : spin_corr ] we explore a three - step analysis . in section  [ sec : bsm ] the effects on @xmath6 induced by new heavy resonances in the s - channel , @xmath7 , from the presence of simple peaks , to non - trivial patterns arising from interference between signal and sm background . in the following section we assume that a resonance is found and study how the spin structure of a resonance affects the angular distributions of the top and anti - top quarks . in section  [ sec : spin_corr ] we discuss how spin - correlations are affected by nature of the coupling of the resonances to sm particles , by simulating the full matrix elements including the decay , @xmath8 .",
    "we leave to section  [ sec : con ] the discussion of the results and our conclusions .",
    "in this section we study the theoretical uncertainties on the available predictions for the invariant mass spectrum and their dependence on the top mass .",
    "we mainly focus on the lhc and refer to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the tevatron .",
    "we start by considering the invariant mass spectrum of the @xmath9 pair calculated up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) , as implemented in mcfm @xcite .",
    "we use the cteq6 m pdf - set @xcite and do not apply cuts on the final state particles . here and in the following we always assume that the invariant mass can be fully reconstructed , see also the appendix . in fig .",
    "[ scale_pdf ] results at the lhc are plotted for three different top quark masses with uncertainty bands associated to the pdf errors and renormalization and factorization scale variations .",
    "the pdf uncertainty is estimated by running the 41 members of cteq6 pdf set , with the scales set equal to @xmath10 , and found to be about @xmath11% .",
    "the scale uncertainty is obtained by varying independently the renormalization and factorization scales in the region between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the associated total scale uncertainty at nlo is about @xmath14% .",
    "thus , the theoretical errors at the lhc are completely dominated by the scale uncertainty .",
    "this is contrast to the tevatron where scale and pdf errors are comparable , of the order @xmath15%  @xcite .",
    "nll resummed calculations suggest that the dependence on the scales could go down to @xmath16% @xcite , however in that analysis the scales were not varied independently .",
    "a more recent study suggests that changing the scales independently might increase the error to a size similar to that estimated through the nlo fixed order calculation  @xcite .",
    "next we compare the nlo shapes for the invariant mass distribution with those obtained at lo and mc@nlo @xcite , fig .",
    "[ scale_pdf_mcatnlo ] , both at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we find that the differences are minimal at the lhc , and well within the uncertainty bands of the theoretical errors on the nlo cross section . on the other hand , at the tevatron the differences between lo and nlo , fixed and dynamic renormalization and factorization scales are larger .    in the high invariant mass region for the lhc , fig .",
    "[ scale_pdf_high ] , the lo approximation starts to deviate from the nlo order and clearly underestimates the nlo distribution ( note that curves here are normalized to the total cross section at nlo ) .",
    "also , as expected , the pdf uncertainties start to increase and dominate the theoretical errors as the most important contributions come from the large @xmath17 region .",
    "next - to - leading order electroweak corrections to the lo distribution are also included in this figure  @xcite .",
    "their effect is to decrease the cross section by a few percent for invariant masses below 1000 gev and up to 15% for invariant masses around 4 tev ( the higgs mass dependence is mild ) .",
    "this means that ew effects on this distribution are negligible compared to the current pdf uncertainties and give only a minor deviation from the lo curve .",
    "we conclude this section by mentioning the other sources of potentially large uncertainties in the determination of the @xmath9 invariant mass .",
    "the first is related to its reconstruction from the decay products . in general",
    "the uncertainty on the @xmath18 distribution will depend on the final state signature ( fully - hadronic , single - lepton and double - lepton final states ) , which determine the reconstruction technique and , more importantly , on the detector efficiencies and resolutions . for completeness",
    "we briefly discuss the current proposals for reconstruction in the various decay channels in the appendix .",
    "the second is due to both qcd backgrounds , _",
    "i.e. _ multi - jet , @xmath19+jets and @xmath20+jets , and top backgrounds , _ i.e. _ single - top and @xmath21 itself as coming from a final state different signature than the one considered . while the qcd backgrounds at the tevatron are severe but very well studied , it has been shown that at the lhc their impact at low @xmath9 invariant mass is negligible when at least one lepton is present in the final state  @xcite . in the high invariant mass tail ,",
    "some qcd backgrounds , and in particular @xmath22 + one or two jets , become important due to the fact that the tops are highly boosted and can give rise to single jet - like topologies when they decay hadronically .",
    "the interested reader can find a detailed study for the single lepton final state signature in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as can be clearly seen from fig .",
    "[ scale_pdf ] , the normalization , as well as the shape of the @xmath9 invariant mass distribution depends on the mass of the top quark .",
    "it is then natural to wonder whether such a rather strong dependence could provide another way to determine the mass of the top quark .",
    "the aim of this subsection is to provide a quantitative answer , based only on the theoretical uncertainties .    in fig",
    ".  [ cross ] we have plotted the @xmath9 production cross section @xmath23 as a function of the top quark mass at the tevatron ( a ) and the lhc ( b ) .",
    "the scale uncertainties , even at the nlo , are rather large . neglecting non - linear terms",
    ", a fit to the central curve gives @xmath24 this equation relates the relative uncertainty on the measurement of the @xmath9 cross section to the relative uncertainty on the top quark mass : the @xmath25 term represents the slope and the constant term the horizontal spread , _",
    "i.e. _ , the scale uncertainty , of the curves in fig .",
    "[ cross ] .",
    "this means that a measurement of the cross section with an uncertainty of 5% would lead to a @xmath26 uncertainty of the top quark mass , the error being mainly associated with scale variations . at the tevatron the situation is slightly different .",
    "the scale dependence is milder , @xmath27 and known to be reduced at nll  @xcite , but the pdf errors , which are not included in the plot , are not negligible and are found to be of a similar size  @xcite .",
    "we can therefore conclude that the accuracy of an independent extraction of the top mass from a measurement of the cross section is limited by the nlo theoretical uncertainties .",
    "recent work suggests that inclusion of nnlo corrections could reduce the scale uncertainties sizably  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore worth investigating whether information on the top mass can be extracted from some other quantity besides the total cross section . in fig .",
    "[ normalized ] the @xmath9 invariant mass distributions normalized to unity , @xmath28 , are plotted for five different top quark masses , @xmath29 gev in steps of 5 gev .",
    "the bands spanned by the red lines show the left - over scale uncertainties which are sizably reduced compared to fig .",
    "[ scale_pdf ] .",
    "we find that the shape of the @xmath30 distribution is quite insensitive to theoretical uncertainties , while retaining a strong dependence on the top quark mass .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider whether the invariant mass distribution could provide an independent measurement of the top quark mass .",
    "one way to quantify to which extent the shape is sensitive to the top mass vs.  the theoretical uncertainties is to perform an analysis based on the first few moments of the normalized @xmath9 invariant mass distributions @xmath28 .",
    "this approach has the virtue of being simple and systematic .",
    "needless to say , alternative quantities , such as the peak position , or more sophisticated techniques , such as kolmogorov tests , could also be employed .    in fig .",
    "[ moments ] we present the mean value @xmath31 , standard deviation @xmath1 , skewness @xmath32 and kurtosis @xmath33 of the @xmath9 invariant mass distributions as a function of the top quark mass @xmath34 for various scales at the lhc .",
    "we remind that the skewness ( kurtosis ) is a dimensionless quantity that gives a measure of asymmetry ( peakedness ) of a distribution .",
    "these quantities are defined as @xmath35 respectively . the central moments @xmath36 are defined as @xmath37 in our analysis we focus on the low invariant mass region and",
    "therefore we have limited the @xmath30 integrals to @xmath38 .",
    "the aim of this cut is just to mimick an experimental analysis where the precision on the higher moments would be limited by the statistics .",
    "since our purpose is only for illustration we do not consider these effects further .",
    "however , we stress that our numerical results do retain a significant dependence on this cutoff .    due to the small scale uncertainty and the strong linear correlation , the mean of the @xmath9 invariant mass distribution , @xmath31 , fig .",
    "[ moments](a ) , appears to be an excellent estimator of the top quark mass . from the experimental point of view",
    ", one can also hope for smaller uncertainties than those associated to the measurement of total cross section .",
    "in fact , to measure the mean , many systematics , such as those coming from luminosity or tagging efficiencies , are much less important .",
    "a fit to the mean value shows that @xmath39 .",
    "so , for instance , if the mean value is measured with a 1% uncertainty , the uncertainty of the top quark mass is only 1.3% , including the scale uncertainties .",
    "the standard deviation , fig .  [ moments](b ) , is almost constant and therefore is not suitable for a top quark mass measurement . in figs .",
    "[ moments](c ) and [ moments](d ) the skewness and the kurtosis for the @xmath9 invariant mass are plotted , respectively . also here ,",
    "the scale uncertainty is reduced , while still slightly larger than for the mean value , fig .",
    "[ moments](a ) .",
    "the slopes of the lines are promising , in particular for the kurtosis , which means that a relatively large experimental error on the measurement of the kurtosis leads to an only small error on the top mass measurement .    at this point",
    ", we have to stress that the above simple analysis does not include neither statistical nor systematics effects in the data , which should also be carefully considered .",
    "in particular , the higher monents such as the skewness and the kurtosis are more sensitive to the tail of the @xmath40 distribution then the lower moments and therefore more sensitive to statistical and systematic effects that affect more strongly this tail .",
    "eventually , the final uncertainty on the top quark mass will depend on how well the above quantities can be measured .",
    "it is plausible to expect that a combined analysis based on the above quantities might lead to an even smaller uncertainty for the top quark mass .    for completeness",
    "we show the same analysis performed at the tevatron energies , see fig .",
    "[ moments_tev ] .",
    "also in this case , we have used a fixed order nlo calculation to estimate the scale uncertainties . however , as we have already mentioned , at the tevatron the @xmath41 pairs are produced almost at threshold , hence a resummed calculation which predicts a smaller scale uncertainty , is preferred  @xcite .",
    "the tevatron results ( fig .",
    "[ moments_tev ] ) are similar to those obtained in the lhc study , but the reduction in the scale uncertainties by analyzing the ( higher ) moments is smaller compared to the lhc .",
    "the first moment , _ i.e. _ , the mean value , is probably the best estimator for the top quark mass among all the moments , due to its small constant value of @xmath42 , and the reasonably good proportionality factor of @xmath43 .",
    "the higher moments are more sensitive to statistical fluctuations and might be less suitable with a limited sample",
    ". the lack of events in the higher invariant mass regions might give rise to larger errors for the skewness and worse the kurtosis .",
    "in these plots we restrict the @xmath9 invariant mass to below @xmath44 gev .",
    "we mention that even though using the fixed order nlo calculation we have overestimated the scale uncertainties , we have neglected the pdf errors which at the tevatron can reach the 6 - 7%  @xcite and errors coming from the reconstruction of the @xmath9 invariant mass from the ( anti-)top quark decay products , see the appendix .    finally , we comment about the definition of the top quark mass . as in the more standard top mass measurements where the top mass is reconstructed from its decay products ,",
    "also the top quark invariant mass is sensitive to extra radiation and to non - perturbative effects due to confinement , typical of a pole mass  @xcite . in this respect",
    "the same issues and problems in associating a theoretically well - defined mass to the measurement remain .",
    "this is at variance with an extraction of the top mass from a cross section measurement which can be directly related to a short distance mass and does not suffer from the same non - perturbative or extra radiation effects .",
    "we stress , however , that @xmath40 is at least twice the top quark mass , which would decrease the relative impact of the ambiguities due to extra radiation .",
    "in addition , typical combinatorial systematics associated to the assignment of the jets to the `` right '' tops , are absent for @xmath40 . in this respect ,",
    "more experimental work on the systematics affecting such a measurement would be certainly welcome .",
    "in this section we investigate the effects of ( model - independent ) new resonances on the @xmath9 invariant mass spectrum .",
    "all the numerical results presented here have been obtained with madgraph / madevent , through the implementation of a dedicated `` model '' , topbsm , which is publicly accessible on the madgraph servers for on - line event generation and for download .",
    "topbsm offers the possibility of studying a wide range of new physics resonances and efficiently exploits the flexibility and the possibilities of madgraph :    * sm effects are consistently included , _",
    "i.e. _ , possibly non - trivial interference effects between new resonances and the @xmath9 background are taken into account . as it will be shown in the following",
    ", in some cases such effects can be important and might lead to very distinctive signatures ( cf . the case of the peak - dip structure arising in @xmath6 due to the presence of a ( pseudo-)scalar state ) . in general , they should be always included . * the full matrix elements @xmath45 including the decays of the top quarks can be generated , which is crucial for spin correlation studies .",
    "* the generated events can be automatically interfaced to parton showers programs , such as pythia  @xcite or herwig  @xcite , to shower and hadronize the events after which these events can be processed by a detector simulation for full experimental analyses .",
    "we have considered @xmath1-channel spin-0 , spin-1 and spin-2 resonances , of different color and @xmath46 parity , as listed in table  [ table_bsm ] .",
    "the parameters related to each resonance are simply the mass , the width and the relevant values of the couplings to standard model particles which enter in the production process ( to the partons and to the top quark ) .",
    ".the bsm particles included in the topbsm `` model '' . [ cols=\"^,^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the second angle , which is commonly considered when studying spin correlations in @xmath9 production is @xmath47 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the angle between the directions of the @xmath48 and @xmath49 in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 rest frames , respectively .",
    "the distribution @xmath52 for this angle is plotted in fig .",
    "[ phi ] for a resonance mass of 800 gev .",
    "the distributions for the angle @xmath47 are the same for production through a scalar and a vector boson .",
    "the distribution for the pseudo - scalar , on the other hand , is completely different from the one for the scalar and the vector boson  @xcite . also , the angular distribution for sm @xmath9 production is different from the other production mechanisms . in the case of a spin-1 state ,",
    "the @xmath47 distribution is independent of the type of coupling to the top : it makes no difference whether it is pure vector , an axial - vector , a left - handed or right - handed couplings .",
    "top physics is entering the precision phase at the tevatron and will be one of the leading priorities at the lhc .",
    "the importance of the top quark in the quest for the mechanism of ewsb and new physics is due to the convergence of two factors .",
    "first the lhc will be a top factory with tens of millions of top quarks produced in the first years of running at the nominal low luminosity , @xmath53 @xmath54 s@xmath55 , allowing studies at an unprecedented level of accuracy .",
    "second , due to its large mass , top is the optimal probe for new physics at tev scales .",
    "many different models , including the sm , predict the existence of heavy states that preferably couple to the top quark , and that could affect its sm couplings via loop corrections or be directly produced at the lhc .    given the large number of the models proposed and their complexity , a `` top - down '' approach , _",
    "e.g. _ , model parameter scanning , will not be practical , in particular if comparison of many different channels and observables at once will be necessary .",
    "as an alternative , a simpler and more pragmatic `` bottom - up '' approach could be employed , whereby one identifies specific observables which can be developed as tools for discriminating generic features of new physics resonances , thus keeping the analysis as model independent as possible .    in this paper",
    "we have presented an example on how such a study could be performed for the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath21 pair .    as a first step",
    "we have assessed the accuracy of the best theoretical predictions available for @xmath2 production at hadron colliders .",
    "we have found that the shape of the distribution is under good theoretical control , especially at low invariant mass values , suggesting also the possibility of a precise top mass extraction .",
    "we have then identified the features of new physics scenarios , namely the existence of heavy bosonic resonances of various spin , color and parity , that could show up in the @xmath6 distribution , and implemented them in the madgraph / madevent package .",
    "the full matrix elements , @xmath56 , @xmath57 being a spin-0 , spin-1 or spin-2 particle , particles with arbitrary masses , width , color and couplings , have been automatically generated by madgraph .",
    "the effects due to the interference with the @xmath58 sm process are included when relevant .",
    "the strategy to gain information on new physics is then straightforward and consists of three successive steps :    1 .   the discovery of the resonance ( and the determination of its mass and width ) which could appear as a sharp or broad peak or as a more distinctive peak - dip structure in very specific cases . in this measurement",
    "the key aspect will be the experimental resolution in the @xmath6 reconstruction .",
    "the identification of the spin of the resonance , which can be inferred from the angular distribution of the top and the anti - top .",
    "3 .   information on the couplings of the resonance to the the top anti - top pair , which can be obtained by measuring the spin correlations of the top anti - top pair ( for this last step the full matrix matrix element @xmath59 is required ) .    in conclusion",
    ", we have outlined a simple strategy and provided the necessary monte carlo tools to search for new resonances in @xmath2 events .",
    "we look forward to more detailed experimental analyses .",

    "where the final state particles masses are known , 16 independent variables are needed to determine the kinematics of the event : the six final state particle three - momenta , @xmath60 , the two energy fractions carried by the initial state partons , @xmath61 , minus the overall momentum conservation which reduces the number of independent variables by 4 , leads to @xmath62 .    from the measured angles and energies of the final state particles , together with constraints from @xmath22",

    "the single lepton in the final state greatly improves the possibility for triggering on these events and extracting it from backgrounds compared to the fully - hadronic decay mode .",
