    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the couplings between gauge bosons and leptons are independent of lepton flavor .",
    "therefore , the branching ratio @xmath6 should basically not depend on the lepton @xmath7 considered .",
    "the quantity :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , is thus expected to be very near to one , the discrepancy from unity being due to small lepton - mass effects ( for instance , the greatest correction should turn out in @xmath10 ) .    beyond the sm , deviations of @xmath11 from this expectation are possible .",
    "in particular , in the next to minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm )  @xcite scenario , there is the hypothesis of existence of a light pseudo - scalar higgs boson , namely @xmath12 , which could be escaped to lep bounds  @xcite .",
    "for instance , considering the leptonic decays of the @xmath13 , such a boson could mediate the decay chain of the resonance in one of the following modes  @xcite :    @xmath14    or @xmath15 the latter decay implies a mixing between @xmath16 , i.e. the ground state of the bottomonium family , recently discovered by  @xcite , and which does not have the right quantum numbers to decay in a pair of leptons , and the light higgs @xmath12 .",
    "if the photon was present but remained undetected because of its softness , the lepton pair would be ascribed to the @xmath13 .",
    "this would result in a deviation of @xmath11 from the sm expectation , that is in a lepton universality violation .",
    "similar considerations hold on for the higher - mass @xmath17 resonances too .",
    "the coupling between @xmath12 and the lepton being proportional to the lepton mass , this effect should be more evident when one of the leptons is a @xmath18 . theoretical calculations  @xcite foresee effects up to an order of @xmath19 .",
    "the cleo collaboration has studied the decays @xmath20 , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 , using a sample of about 1 fb@xmath23 of data taken at each @xmath24 peak , corresponding to about @xmath25 @xmath17 resonances .",
    "in particular , for the @xmath13 , they measured the branching fraction ratio :    @xmath26(stat.)@xmath27(syst . ) ,    deriving :    @xmath28    at the @xmath29 of confidence level  @xcite .",
    "we present a measurement of @xmath2 in @xmath13 decays exploiting the sample of @xmath0 decays collected by the  detector at the pep - ii asymmetric @xmath30 collider at the slac national accelerator laboratory .",
    "the available statistics ( @xmath31 fb@xmath23 , corresponding to @xmath32 events ) represents the largest sample of @xmath0 decays ever collected .",
    "the 2.4 fb@xmath23 of data collected 30 mev below the @xmath0 resonance ( _ off - resonance _",
    "sample ) are also used for background studies .",
    "the  detector is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "charged - particle momenta are measured in a tracking system consisting of a five - layer double - sided silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) and a 40-layer central drift chamber ( dch ) , both situated in a 1.5-t axial magnetic field .",
    "charged - particle identification is based on the @xmath33 measured in the svt and dch , and on a measurement of the photons produced in the synthetic fused - silica bars of the ring - imaging cherenkov detector .",
    "a csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter is used to detect and identify photons and electrons , while muons are identified in the instrumented flux return of the magnet .",
    "we use the geant  @xcite software to simulate interactions of particles traversing the  detector , taking into account the varying detector conditions and beam backgrounds .",
    "the signal events ( @xmath34 or @xmath21 ) are tagged through the transition @xmath35 , whose branching fraction is @xmath36  @xcite .",
    "we consider all the decays of @xmath18 to one charged track plus undetected neutrals : this choice leads to a very clear environment for our study , since both the typologies of final states ( @xmath37 and @xmath21 ) contain four charged tracks , allowing for a better handling of backgrounds and a good trigger performance .    because of the presence of neutrinos in the final state , the @xmath35 ,",
    "@xmath38 decays are not fully reconstructed , and suffer from a larger contamination from background with respect to the @xmath34 events .",
    "for this reason the event selections are mostly different for the two categories of final states .",
    "the event selections are tuned using monte carlo simulated samples .",
    "the main sources of background are @xmath39 ( with @xmath40 ) and @xmath41 continuum events , bhabha events and generic @xmath13 decays ; the latter produce a peaking yield .",
    "the two typologies of signal events ( @xmath37 and @xmath21 final states ) are separated thanks to a cut on the difference between the visible and the reconstructed energy , calculated in the @xmath30 center of mass frame ( cm ) : indeed , no missing energy is expected in @xmath34 events , that are completely reconstructed , while an amount of missing energy is actually present in @xmath38 decays .    moreover , to further reduce the background in the @xmath21 final states , a boosted decision tree  @xcite exploiting several shape and kinematic variables is used .",
    "the performance of the classifier is assessed using signal monte carlo simulations and _ off - resonance _ data .",
    "after the application of the multivariate approach , the separation between signal and background is sensitively improved , as visible in figure  [ fig : mva ] .",
    "additional cuts are applied for the @xmath37 selection on the cosine of the angle between the two - lepton candidates calculated with respect to the cm frame , for the @xmath21 selection on the difference in the energy of the @xmath0 and the @xmath13 , and for both the selections on the momentum of each of the two pions , as well as of the pair of them .",
    "the signal extraction efficiency is @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) for @xmath37 ( @xmath21 ) final states .",
    "the signal extraction is performed using an extended and unbinned maximum - likelihood fit ; the likelihood for the @xmath34 events is 2-dimensional and based on the variables @xmath44 , that is the difference between the invariant masses of the two @xmath17 resonances involved in the decay chain , and @xmath45 , the invariant dimuon mass . instead , for the @xmath38 events",
    ", the signal extraction can not be performed in the same way : the partial reconstruction of the final state , due to the presence of neutrinos from the @xmath18 s decays , means that neither @xmath46 nor the dilepton invariant mass can be used to discriminate between signal and background .",
    "therefore , we extract the signal yield performing a 1-dimensional fit to the recoil mass of the pair of pions involved in the decay chain , defined as :    @xmath47    where @xmath48 indicates the nominal cm energy  @xcite , @xmath49 indicates the invariant mass of the two pions , and @xmath50 is the momentum of the two pions calculated in the cm frame .",
    "because this variable is related only to the @xmath51 transition , it can not distinguish between @xmath38 events and other @xmath13 decays or the higgs - mediated events of eq .",

    "[ eqn : a0_etabmix ] .",
    "we use a simulated sample of inclusive @xmath13 decays to verify that this background becomes negligible when the event selection is applied .",
    "additional tests are performed with the data sample to prove this conclusion , as discussed in detail below .",
    "an enhancement of the @xmath38 yield would thus constitute a possible signal of new physics .",
    "the two fits are performed simultaneously , and the value of @xmath2 is returned .",
    "the likelihood is written as    @xmath52    where @xmath53 is : @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 indicate the number of the signal events extracted in the @xmath37 sample , the number of background events extracted in the @xmath37 sample and the number of background events extracted in the @xmath21 sample , respectively .    in the fit ,",
    "the probability density functions ( pdfs ) for the signal components in @xmath34 sample are taken from a subset of data ( about one tenth of the complete available statistics , which is discarded from the eventual result in order to avoid any possible bias ) ; the @xmath46 distribution is described by a triple gaussian function with uncommon means , while the @xmath45 distribution is modeled by an analytical function approximating a gaussian with mean value equal to @xmath58 and different left and right widths @xmath59 , plus asymmetric non gaussian tails @xmath60 , defined as :    @xmath61    in @xmath38 events , the pdf for the signal component is taken from the data sample @xmath34 sample ( where the dipion recoil mass is not used as a variable for the signal extraction and is therefore independent of the fit procedure ) ; the @xmath62 distribution is described by the function defined in eq .",
    "[ eqn : cruijff ] .",
    "all the parameters of the signal pdfs are fixed in the fit , while the background shapes ( flat functions in @xmath37 sample and polynomial function of first order in @xmath21 sample ) are floated in the fit .",
    "we use the _ off - resonance _ sample to verify that the analytic description of the background shapes is appropriate .",
    "the result of the simultaneous fit procedure is shown in figure  [ fig : fit ] , while table  [ tab : fit ] shows the results for the signal and background yields , along with the results of the @xmath63 tests , made to compare the data distribution with the curve chosen to describe it ( where @xmath64 indicates the number of degrees of freedom , namely equal to the number of histogram bins minus the number of parameters fixed in the pdf ) .",
