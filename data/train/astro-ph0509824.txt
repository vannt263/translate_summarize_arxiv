    "the study of the early type galaxies has allowed the discovery of a plane in the 3-d space of intrinsic properties of galaxies .",
    "this plane is known as the fundamental plane ( fp ) and is expressed as the relation between luminosity , size and intrinsic kinetic energy ( dressler et al . , 1987 ;",
    "djorgovski & davis , 1987 ; guzmn et al . ,",
    "1993 ) . from the analysis of the fp , information about physical properties , formation and evolution of systems can be obtained . moreover , the fp has been extensively used as a distance indicator playing an important role in the determination of the hubble constant ( @xmath2 ) .    the fp concept has also been extended to other systems such as galaxy clusters .",
    "schaeffer et al . ( 1993 ) , adami et al . ( 1998 ) , fujita & takahara ( 1999 ) and fritsch & buchert ( 1999 ) have confirmed the existence of a fundamental plane for these large systems .",
    "another topic to be considered when the fp is analysed is the dynamical state of the sample .",
    "fritsch & buchert ( 1999 ) claim that clusters with less substructures ( more relaxed ) are the strongest tracers of the fp and suggests that the dispersion around the fp is the result of systems of galaxies with a lower degree of relaxation . beyond these preliminary results ,",
    "all these authors agree that a larger sample is necessary to have significant statistical weight .    at present , the largest redshift survey of galaxies is the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) dr3 .",
    "recently , merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 ) have identified groups of galaxies in this survey , providing the largest sample of groups . using a sub - sample of this group catalogue , the present work studies the fundamental plane of galaxy groups and their mass to light ratio .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section 2 , we describe the data sample ; in section 3 , we briefly describe the set of parameters used to define the fundamental plane , while the fit itself is presented in section 4 .",
    "the mass to light ratio analysis is detailed in section 5 .",
    "we summarise our results and conclusions in section 6 .",
    "the present work is based on a subsample of the groups identified in the sdss dr3 by merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 ) . due to the nature of the present work , a very reliable and homogeneous sample of groups is required .",
    "therefore , we only select those groups with at least 10 members .",
    "since the parameters that define the fp can be sensitive to the selection of the groups centre , we implemented the iterative method described by daz et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , which reduces the contamination by substructure .",
    "the final sample ( hereafter mzdm sample ) consists of @xmath3 groups .",
    "the median redshift , 3-d velocity dispersion and number of members are @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "the distribution of velocity dispersions shown in the left panel of figure [ fig0 ] indicates that our sub - sample includes both low and high mass systems of galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of a group of galaxies identified within a magnitude - limited galaxy sample needs to be corrected for incompleteness effects . in order to correctly compute the luminosity of each group identified in the mzdm sample we use the method described by moore et al.(1993 ) . according to these authors ,",
    "the group optical luminosity is defined by the following expression : @xmath7 where @xmath8 with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 is the luminosity function of galaxies in groups . throughout this work we use luminosities in the r - band .",
    "the absolute magnitudes @xmath13 are calculated using the @xmath14 corrections as a function of redshift , following a method similar to that described by norberg et al .",
    "this method uses the bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) stellar population synthesis code .",
    "the luminosity functions of galaxies in groups are estimated following the procedure described by martnez et al .",
    "( 2002 ) . using the complete sample of galaxies in groups identified by merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 )",
    ", we found the following schechter parameters : @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the adopted absolute solar magnitude is @xmath17 ( blanton et al .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig0 ] shows the distribution of our group luminosities which extends from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "we adopt an upper limit to the measurement error of @xmath20 in the luminosities as recommended by adami et al.(1998 ) .",
    "= 0.5      the velocity dispersion of each group is calculated using the standard technique described by beers et al .",
    "we apply the biweight estimator for groups with richness @xmath21 and the gapper estimator for poorer groups .",
    "the median 3-d velocity dispersion for the complete sample of groups is @xmath22 .",
    "the error in the 3-d velocity dispersion is around of @xmath23 as stated by beers et al.(1990 ) .",
    "the group characteristic radii is calculated as suggested by eke et al.(2004a ) .",
    "these authors compute the projected group size using the rms projected physical separation of the galaxies respect to the group centre : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the projected distance between the centre position and the @xmath26 galaxy and ngal is the number of group members .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig0 ] shows the distribution of group radius .",
    "the median radii of the sample is @xmath27 .",
    "the error in the radius @xmath28 was estimated using monte carlo realisations of mock groups with a given density profile .",
    "the procedure takes into account the number of members used to compute the radius and includes uncertainties in the centre position .",
    "considering possible differences between mock and real groups , we adopt a 20% as a conservative upper limit for the error in the group s radius .",
    "= 0.5    a simple way to start the study of the fundamental plane is by analysing its different projections .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 projections of the fp . as can be appreciated in the left and right upper panels , both , the @xmath29 and the @xmath30 show a clear correlation in the sense that groups that have large radii or high velocity dispersions tend to be more luminous than those that are smaller or dynamically colder .",
    "we fit the @xmath29 relation using a method that minimises the sum of the squared weighted orthogonal distances to an analytical curve ( or surface ) . throughout this work",
    ", we perform the fitting procedures using the routines of odrpack ( boggs et al . , 1992 ) , which takes into account errors in all the coordinates involved .",
    "the errors assigned to each coordinate are : @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "the best fit is shown in the left upper panel of figure [ fig1 ] ( solid line ) .",
    "filled squares are the median luminosities per bin of velocity dispersion , the error associated with the median is the semi - interquartile range .",
    "the best fitting relation is : @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the right upper panel shows the @xmath30 relation , the best fit is : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "left lower panel of figure [ fig1 ] shows the projection of the fp in the @xmath31 plane .",
    "larger groups tend to have higher velocity dispersions ; however , the correlation is marginal . due to the poor correlation ,",
    "the fitting routine does not produce an acceptable relation between radius and velocity dispersion .",
    "finally , the right lower panel shows the @xmath41 relation .",
    "the fit to the data corresponds to the plane equation @xmath42 the best - fitting parameters given by the odrpack subroutines are : @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    even though a good correlation is found , one of the key questions is the origin of the observed dispersion , which could be a consequence of the contribution of groups with different characteristics .",
    "several authors have found that clusters lie in a plane in the 3-d space of @xmath46 .",
    "nevertheless , they still discuss how the fundamental plane must be defined .",
    "should all the groups lie in the same plane ? or , is the fundamental plane only well defined for groups with some particular physical properties ?",
    "the assumption of virial state implies that clusters have a constant mass to light ratio , which suggests that groups should lie in a plane defined by @xmath47 .",
    "nowadays , we know that not all the clusters are virialized , and that the dynamical equilibrium is less common in groups .",
    "a more realistic determination of the dynamical state of groups is thus necessary .",
    "the size of our group sample gives us a unique opportunity to test whether group dynamical state is one of the factors responsible for the observed dispersion .",
    "= 0.3    the dynamical state of a group can be studied in different ways .",
    "taking into account the available information , we apply two complementary parameters : a dimensionless crossing time , @xmath48 , and the early type fraction in groups , @xmath49 .",
    "\\(i ) the dimensionless crossing time , used by hickson et al ( 1992 ) , reflects the dynamical evolution since it is proportional to the inverse of the number of times that a galaxy could have traversed the group from its formation to the present time .",
    "@xmath48 is defined by :    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the mean projected galaxy separation in a group , and @xmath52 is the 3-d velocity dispersion .",
    "\\(ii ) if the morphology of galaxies in groups and clusters are the result of environmental processes that subsequently transform galaxies between different morphological classes , early type galaxies should be more numerous in evolved clusters than in young less evolved systems.the fraction of early type galaxies per group is computed after splitting the galaxy sample into 3 spectral types , following daz et al .",
    "the fraction @xmath49 is : @xmath53 , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 group total number of members and the number of early type galaxies , respectively .",
    "@xmath49 should reflect the degree of relaxation of a system .",
    "neither @xmath48 nor @xmath49 are strongly correlated with the redshift nor with the group mass , which is calculated following eke et al .",
    "( 2004a ) : @xmath56    we study the dependence of the fundamental plane on these dynamical parameters .",
    "first at all , we define subsamples according to their corresponding @xmath48 values : ( 1 ) more evolved : @xmath57 , ( 2 ) intermediate evolution : @xmath58 , and ( 3 ) less evolved : @xmath59 .",
    "upper panel of figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath48 distribution .",
    "vertical lines are the @xmath60 and @xmath61 values .",
    "we fit a plane ( eq . [ fp ] ) for each subsample .",
    "we find no differences between these planes and the defined by the whole sample .",
    "we measure the orthogonal scatter around the fp .",
    "this orthogonal scatter quantify the aloofness from the fp .",
    "neither of the 3 subsamples shows differences in the scatters .",
    "we split the group sample into the following subsamples , according to their fraction of early type galaxies : ( 1 ) less evolved @xmath62 , ( 2)intermediate evolution @xmath63 , and ( 3 ) more evolved @xmath64 .",
    "the quoted values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 where selected in order to have subsamples of similar size .",
    "the middle panel in figure [ fig2 ] shows the @xmath49 distribution , and the @xmath65 and @xmath66 values . applying the same analysis used for @xmath48",
    ", we find no differences in the fitted fps as in the orthogonal dispersions for the three different subsamples .",
    "finally , we seek for a correlation between @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "it is shown in the lower panel of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the relation is not injective .",
    "we perform a linear fit in logarithmic axes which is shown as solid line in the figure .",
    "then , we combine both parameters to pick up two subsamples , corresponding to the more ( narrow hatched region ) and less ( wide hatched region ) evolved groups : ( 1 ) @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and ( 2 ) @xmath69 and @xmath70 . again , we compute the plane and the orthogonal scatters around the fp for each subsample .",
    "the results are the same found before .",
    "both subsamples have the same behaviour .    from the analysis performed in this section ,",
    "we conclude that , using the parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 to study the group dynamical state , the fundamental plane does not show signs of evolution .",
    "we also study the dependence of the fundamental plane on the group redshifts .",
    "we define 2 subsamples corresponding to the lowest and the highest redshift ranges .",
    "the resulting planes have no differences with the fp defined by the whole sample , and the orthogonal scatters around the fp are very similar for both subsamples .",
    "however , this result is not conclusive since our sample spans only a small redshift range ( @xmath71 ) , wherein only minor dynamical evolution is expected .    finally , in order to show that the fundamental plane expected from the virial assumption is rejected by the mzdm sample ,",
    "the upper panel of figure [ fig3 ] shows the @xmath72 relation .",
    "solid line is the best fit to the data ( filled squares : @xmath73 per bin of @xmath52 ) , and dashed line is the relation expected when assuming virial state .",
    "lower panel of this figure shows the ratios between the median values and the linear relations ( best fit : filled squares - virial relation : filled circles ) .",
    "it can be seen that the virial relation is not a good description to the observational data .",
    "= 0.4    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "= 0.4    the fact that the fp we measure is different from the one expected assuming virial equilibrium ( @xmath74 ) means that the mass to light ratio must vary .",
    "girardi et al.(2000 ) calculate the @xmath75 relation and find that the luminosity has a tendency to increase slower than the mass ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "these authors also suggest that this result is independent of the photometric band , which was confirmed by popesso et al .",
    "( 2004 ) . figure [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath77 scatter plot ( points ) corresponding to the complete sample of groups .",
    "filled squares are the median luminosity per bin of mass , errors in the median luminosities are computed as the semi - interquartile range , and the mass errors are computed by error propagation ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "solid line corresponds to the best fit to @xmath79 , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "this result is in agreement ( within 2 @xmath82 ) with the results obtained by girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and it is also comparable ( within @xmath82 ) with the results of popesso et al .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath83 varies almost linear with @xmath52(@xmath84 ) ( quadratic in the virial case ) , then the @xmath85 ratio must increase with @xmath52 , it means with @xmath86 .",
    "several authors have stated that is not correct to search for the best fitting relation of @xmath87 ratio versus @xmath86 or @xmath83 ( eke et al .",
    ", 2004b , popesso et al . , 2004 , girardi et al . 2002 )",
    ", then it is more suitable to infer the relations from the @xmath88 directly . therefore , our previous result implies @xmath89 , it means that the mass to light ratio of galaxy groups is not constant , @xmath85 varies up to a factor of @xmath90 from low to high mass groups .",
    "the group sample analysed in our work presents a steeper slope of the @xmath85 vs @xmath86 relation , in comparison with previous works on groups and clusters of galaxies ( @xmath91 girardi et al . , 2000 ,",
    "adami et al . 1998 ; @xmath92 popesso et al . 2004 ) , but they are in good agreement within 1 @xmath52-level .",
    "the median mass to light ratio of our sample is @xmath93 .    in order to check the stability of our results against a different choice of the group size",
    ", we repeated our analysis using the group standard virial radius and the virial mass provided by merchn & zandivarez 2005 .",
    "the median virial radius of the sample under study is @xmath94 .",
    "the relation between the virial radius and the radius used in this work is linear ( @xmath95 ) with a small dispersion , but it has a non zero intercept . then , the fundamental plane fitted using the virial radius slightly differs from the fit derived in the previous section .",
    "the @xmath96 relation does not depend on the definition of the radius or mass .",
    "comparing the orthogonal scatter produced by the two different selection of the size parameters , we find that the characteristic radius proposed by eke et al .",
    "( 2004a ) produces the smaller scatter in both , the fundamental plane and the @xmath96 fits , and it also produces smaller errors in the fitted parameters .",
    "table 1 shows the results corresponding to the two size parameters .",
    "in this work we study whether the more numerous galaxy systems , the galaxy groups , lie in the so - called `` fundamental plane '' , defined by their physical properties .",
    "we analyse a subsample of the merchn & zandivarez ( 2005 ) catalogue of groups ( mzdm sample ) .",
    "the use of this large and homogeneous sample allows us to obtain results that are statistically reliable .",
    "we find that these groups define a plane given by @xmath97 which is different from the plane that is expected if one assumes virial equilibrium .",
    "we also analyse the aloofness from the plane as a function of the dynamical state of groups and their redshifts.we find that none subsample has a tendency to lie farther or closer from the fp .",
    "we also find that the mass to light ratio increases with group mass as @xmath98 . over the mass range of our sample ( two orders of magnitude ) ,",
