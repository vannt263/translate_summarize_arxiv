    "the mathematical theory used by economists up to now is probability theory and optimization theory .",
    "these theories can not explain significant changes brought about by computerization just as , at the beginning of the 20th century , the classical physics could not interpret new experiments .",
    "nowadays the mathematical background of economics is the so - called complexity theory ( a.  n.  kolmogorov , 1956 ) and the closely - related theory of mathematical prediction ( r.solomonoff , 1964 ) as well as some other arithmetic ( addition rules ) introduced by the author @xcite .",
    "the threshold values guaranteeing economic security , which are cited by the economists , are rather nebulous ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "these values correspond to the violation of economic security , while it is of interest to find the threshold values beforehand so that correction measures can be taken .",
    "let me give a simple example of a critical number .",
    "recall the `` trick '' of korovjev , aka fagot , in the novel `` master and margarita '' by mikhail bulgakov .",
    "banknotes of 10-ruble denomination were scattered among the spectators at a variety show .",
    "we assume that all the variants of permutation of @xmath0 banknotes among @xmath1 spectators are equiprobable ( the chaos assumption ) . in that case , if the number of spectators is greater than @xmath2 , then there is a large probability that @xmath3 spectators will not get anything at all .",
    "but if the spectators are combined into groups so that the number of groups is @xmath4 , then there is a large probability that all the groups will get some banknotes , which will be than divided in a friendly manner among all the members according to the rules of ordinary arithmetic .",
    "this represents the amount of intervention of ordinary arithmetic ( state management ) into the arithmetic of a chaotic market , which is determined by the excess of indicators over the corresponding critical number .    in real economics , corporate bodies ( firms ) , not natural persons ,",
    "are analogs of the spectators .",
    "laws of ordinary arithmetic and planning act within each firm where there is no economic competition .",
    "but there is economic competition among firms .",
    "state regulatory intervention is necessary in cases where the critical number is exceeded and some firms go bankrupt .    in the case of the bankruptcy of a firm ,",
    "its employees become unemployed . and , in that case",
    ", it is up to the state to take care of them , otherwise , there may be trouble for the employed citizens .",
    "therefore , the state must intervene in free economic relations and plan the corresponding actions where necessary .",
    "the amount of such intervention depends on the excess of the predicted value over the critical number .    as i have already pointed out on numerous occasions , another way to fight the `` inexorable law of numbers ''",
    "is to introduce a multi - currency system , which increases the barter component .",
    "let me give an example",
    ".    suppose we want to deposit two kopecks in two different banks ( see @xcite ; then we can say that there are three possibilities : ( 1 ) put both kopecks into one of the banks ; ( 2 ) put both kopecks into the other bank ; ( 3 ) one kopeck in one bank , the other , in the other one . here",
    "it is of no consequence which of the two coins we deposit in the first bank and what is its year of issue .",
    "now imagine a situation in which we are depositing one kopeck and one pence instead of two kopecks . in that case , we have four options rather than three , because it is significant which coin we placed in what bank , and so the variant in which the coins are placed in different banks yields two different options : ( a ) one kopeck to bank  1 and one pence to bank  2 ; ( b ) one kopeck to bank  2 and one pence to bank  1 .",
    "the first case corresponds to the bose ",
    "einstein statistics that leads , as is well known , to the bose ",
    "einstein condensate . in financial mathematics ,",
    "this phenomenon  @xcite yields threshold values . in the second case",
    ", the number of variants corresponds to the boltzmann statistics , which , however , does not encompass such a phenomenon .",
    "let me give a second example .",
    "the members of a family wish to change their flat into two flats .",
    "nowadays , in russia , the flat in question is sold and then two flats are bought with the help of real - estate agencies .",
    "this procedure takes at least two months . in soviet times , there were long exchange chains , which can now be optimized using computers and data bases .",
    "if the price of flats rapidly changes during the flat - exchange process , then , due to the uniform variation of prices , the parties do not lose anything if all the flats are exchanged at the same time .",
    "since such an exchange chain corresponds to the boltzmann statistics , there is no bose condensate .",
    "there is yet another method , which was described in bulgakov s novel : the 10-ruble banknotes turned into sweet wrappers .",
    "but , in that case , there is no more trust in 10-ruble banknotes , which leads to a downturn in the economy , as is happening now in our country where the banks are afraid of giving out ruble credits .",
    "if the government does not intervene , then such processes may occur spontaneously , leading to undesirable losses .",
    "there is no way to avoid mathematical laws . as admiral kolchak put it , there is `` this inexorable law of numbers '' by which he apparently meant superiority in numbers .",
    "the separation of the money supply from the debt total is an approximation just as the quantum statistical physics of bosons is an approximation of scalar quantum field theory in its hamiltonian version@xcite . in the latter theory ,",
    "particles and holes can be created and annihilated in the same way as money annihilates debts .",
    "there is also a rapid turnover in debts ; they are annihilated and created anew . however , in the mean , both debts and assets are quite obvious even more so than money and money turnover .",
    "if we use an electronic bank card for payments , then this increases the rate of turnover in the same way as e - mail increases the postal delivery rate .",
    "however , we must find the weak limit with respect to these rapid variations so as to obtain threshold values to be discussed in what follows .",
    "the concept of the mean rate of turnover defined in textbooks in economics as the ratio of gdp to the amount of the available money was meaningful only in the case of gold coins .",
    "but , nowadays , it is the same weak limit , which is practically used when in estimating bank assets .    in the same way , in the thermodynamic limit of the total system ,",
    "the number of particles @xmath5 and holes @xmath6 is preserved ( the model of ions  electrons in a plasma ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "hence the sum @xmath7 is also preserved .",
    "but if we consider a subsystem in which the number  @xmath6 has increased due to external action , then , in the first equilibrium approximation , it turns out that @xmath8 is preserved , and hence @xmath5 is decreased . at the same time",
    ", the total energy after deduction of the infinite energy of vacuum is preserved .",
    "approximately , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the total energy , @xmath11 is the energy of one particle , and @xmath12 making the replacement @xmath13 , we obtain @xmath14 taking   into account , we can write @xmath15    here the term @xmath16 tends to infinity as @xmath17 .",
    "this is the analog of the energy of vacuum , which must be deducted .",
    "a rigorous proof of passages to the limit with deduction of infinities is difficult .",
    "an attempt to justify these passages mathematically ( such as the passage to nonrelativistic quantum field theory ) was made in  @xcite ,  @xcite , and  @xcite .    how to interpret the law of conservation of the sum @xmath18 ( the sum of assets and liabilities ) in economics ?",
    "although a significant role in economics is played by the psychological factor , this law , nevertheless , corresponds to mathematical laws in the mean ( after averaging over subjects and time ) .",
    "let us assume that a young family borrows some money for education , mortgage , and a car .",
    "this stimulates the family to earn more money .",
    "if one - half of the increased income is used to repay the loan , and the other half goes toward increasing the assets , then we have @xmath19 .",
    "debts and assets treated separately are , in fact , the result of averaging over rapid transitions `` credits@xmath20incomes . ''    in practice , both debts ( liabilities ) and money ( assets ) are calculated , although , as pointed out above , they are averaged over rapidly varying turnovers `` money@xmath20debts . ''",
    "therefore , pre - crisis american banks can be associated with , for example , the time series of their assets and they can be classified according to the size of their assets .",
    "the journal `` forbes '' classifies the richest people by the mean size of their fortune . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", we are not interested in the names of persons or banks , but in their numbers ordered in the same way as in `` forbes , '' beginning with the greatest fortune , and also their variation over sufficiently large time intervals . only from these time series , can we determine economic threshold values by using the theorems given below in this paper .",
    "let us begin by considering debts .",
    "in addition to other features of a debt , such as the percentage , each debt  @xmath21 is characterized by its period of repayment ( pay - out period )  @xmath22 .",
    "the ratio of the debt size to its pay - out period is the quantity of immediate interest to the borrower , because it determines the amount of extra effort per day needed to repay the debt in time .",
    "if there are debts @xmath23 , @xmath24 , with pay - out periods  @xmath25 , then the sum of the ratios of debts to their pay - out periods represents the amount of extra money to be earned each day .",
    "the ratio of @xmath26 to the amount of all the debts @xmath27 is the mean period of repayment of all debts .    here",
    "we present a criterion and a certain critical constant ( threshold level ) .",
    "if the mean period of repayment of debts is greater than this level , then the borrower is bankrupt .",
    "this quantity is just as precise as the number of spectators at koroviev s performance ; the important thing is that it depends on quantities specified by the series @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this looks like a mathematical mystery .",
    "however , this phenomenon is related to a remarkable physical fact , namely , the existence of the bose ",
    "einstein condensate for a bose gas .",
    "in our case , this means that if this number is greater than the critical number , then the debts turn out to be long - term ones , which usually are mortgages .",
    "people did not believe in this physical phenomenon for a long time , but , finally , got used to it . and there",
    "exist many experiments that confirm this phenomenon . in deterministic physics",
    ", it has no easy explanation .",
    "but there is an explanation in economics .",
    "there are few experiments involving a crisis : it seems that there is just one such world - wide experiment . in this sense",
    ", economics can enrich physics , just as it helped the author to explain the so - called @xmath30-point in the bose condensate of helium-4 and the thiess  landau model ( see below ) .",
    "the war in iraq required substantial loans , mostly internal ones ( such as from insurance companies ) and a subsystem ( financial bodies and the defence industry ) having received @xmath6 credits ( debts , holes ) decreased the number of particles ( the total energy being constant ) according to the law  ; this means that the turnover of particles ( the bose - gas temperature ) increased or , as the economists put it , the subsystem has heated up and there began an abrupt upturn in the economy of the subsystem . naturally , this resulted in an increase of mortgage ( floating ) interests , while most of the people living in mortgaged houses was not involved in the system where incomes were growing .",
    "hence the mortgage crisis occurred and this was followed by the crisis of insurance companies dealing with mortgages ( and also long - term credits ) , etc .",
    "this is a rather deterministic explanation of bose condensate .",
    "it is up to physicists and , especially , specialists in mathematical physics to try to carry over this explanation to scalar hamiltonian field theory and use it for the deduction of the bose - condensate phenomenon .",
    "let us now turn to the opposite phenomenon , inflation ( it is opposite in the sense that , as shown above , the debt crisis leads to deflation ) .",
    "here the situation is more complex , but it easily explains inflation at the time when the currency was in the form of gold coins .",
    "one could also calculate the gdp at that time , but , in contrast to the present time , one could calculate the number of gold coins in circulation more precisely ( although bills of credit were also used , but they could hardly be used to buy goods in a shop ; they could be bought up in order to bring about a bankruptcy ) . at present , banknotes are seldom used in shops abroad , mostly bank cards and cheques , which , in fact , are bills of credit .",
    "therefore , in textbooks on economics , there is a tradition of long standing to state the main law of economics as follows : the mean rate of turnover of money ( gold coins ) is equal to the ratio of the gdp to the total number of gold coins .",
    "the gdp of a country is composed of similar quantities associated with its constituent parts ( regions ) and these quantities , in turn , involve quantities corresponding to finer structures .",
    "in such series , one can precisely calculate the threshold turnover rate possessing the following property : if the mean turnover rate is less than this threshold value , then inflation occurs , as a result of which smaller coins ( copecks in russia ) are no longer used , while gold coins disappear into money boxes or chests .",
    "all the critical constants given above are highly sensitive to a phenomenon called `` protectionism . ''",
    "suppose that , in our example , koroviev took pity on those spectators that did not get any banknotes and he gave them one banknote in `` aid . ''",
    "thus , he changed the situation by equating such people to those who got one banknote by the `` market '' law .",
    "this is the same as if the unemployment benefit were raised to the level of the wages of some categories of workers .",
    "then these workers would find themselves to be on the same `` zero '' level of unemployed persons .",
    "if the debts of the debtors are restructured to a longer period , then those who took credits ( such as mortgage ) for such long periods are threatened .",
    "then the kind koroviev should have added some money to those spectators who had grabbed just one banknote .",
    "thus , if credit owners suffer as a result of `` protectionism , '' they should be the ones to get help in the first place .    since the law of conservation of energy in the physics of particles",
    "photons that are created and annihilated at a great rate is valid in the mean , it follows that the number of particles and holes is preserved in the mean , too . despite a tremendous rate of debts ",
    "money transitions , in modern computer economics , assets and liabilities are preserved in the mean in the weak limit , and we can consider the time series of these quantities .",
    "let us return to koroviev s trick .",
    "assume that there were @xmath0 banknotes and @xmath1 persons in the audience , where @xmath31 we certainly assume that all versions of distributing @xmath0 banknotes among @xmath1 persons are equiprobable . terms are equiprobable .",
    "] let us state a theorem of number theory .",
    "let @xmath0 be a positive integer . by a _",
    "_ p__artition of @xmath0 we mean a way to represent a natural number @xmath0 as a sum of natural numbers .",
    "let @xmath32 be the total number of partitions of  @xmath0 , where the order of the summands is not taken into account , i.e. , partitions that differ only in the order of summands are assumed to be the same",
    ". the number @xmath33 of partitions of a positive integer @xmath0 into @xmath1 positive integer summands is one of the fundamental objects of investigation in number theory .    in a given partition ,",
    "denote the number of summands ( in the sum ) equal to 1 by @xmath34 , the number of summands equal to 2 by @xmath35 , etc . , and",
    "the number of summands equal to @xmath36 by @xmath37 .",
    "then @xmath38 is the number of summands , and the sum @xmath39 is obviously equal to the partitioned positive integer .",
    "thus , we have @xmath40 where the @xmath37 are natural numbers not exceeding  @xmath1 .",
