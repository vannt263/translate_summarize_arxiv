    "the aim of this paper is to study derived equivalences for a class of finite - dimensional algebras defined from triangulations of punctured surfaces with boundary .",
    "the algebras we consider in this paper arose from the connections between fomin and zelevinsky s cluster algebras @xcite and two subjects : triangulations of riemann surfaces and representation theory of algebras .    on one hand , given a triangulation of an orientable surface ( possibly with boundary ) with marked points",
    ", one can consider the adjacency quiver of this triangulation .",
    "it was proved in @xcite that the combinatorics of the flips of the triangulation are closely related to the combinatorics of mutation in the cluster algebra associated to the quiver .    on the other hand",
    ", it was discovered in @xcite that the representations of a quiver allow us to explicitly recover the generators of cluster algebras .",
    "the most general results are obtained by considering quivers with potentials ( as introduced in @xcite ) ; the combinatorics of the associated cluster algebra is then encoded in a triangulated category , the generalized cluster category , defined by the first author in @xcite .    these two approaches to cluster algebras",
    "can be linked in the following way : to the quiver of a triangulated surface , the second author associated a potential in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) , and proved , in broad terms , that the combinatorics of the two approaches agree .",
    "the process of mutation in the cluster category bears many similarities to tilting theory ; in particular , it was proved in @xcite that to any tilted algebra given by a quiver with relations , one can associate a cluster - tilted algebra defined by a quiver with potential ; the new quiver is obtained from the original one by adding arrows .",
    "surface cut algebras ( or surface algebras ) , introduced in @xcite , are defined by the inverse process of removing arrows from a quiver with potential arising from a triangulation of a surface .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath1 be the quiver with potential associated to a triangulation @xmath2 of a marked surface @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a degree map assigning degree @xmath5 or @xmath6 to each arrow of @xmath7 , in such a way that the potential @xmath8 is homogeneous of degree @xmath6 .",

    "@xmath9 is the degree zero subalgebra of the jacobian algebra of @xmath10 , provided it has global dimension @xmath11 .",
    "equivalently , the cut algebra is obtained from the jacobian algebra by quotienting by the ideal generated by all arrows of degree @xmath6 ( in other words , by `` removing '' these arrows ) , hence the similarity with the process in @xcite where arrows are added to tilted algebras .    since tilted algebras of a given type",
    "are derived equivalent , it becomes natural to ask whether surface cut algebras arising from the same marked surface are also derived equivalent .",
    "our main result characterizes the cases where this is true .",

    "this generalizes results obtained in @xcite ( for unpunctured spheres and @xmath22 ) and in @xcite ( for unpunctured surfaces in general ) .",
    "the proof of the main theorem relies heavily on the cluster category defined in @xcite for algebras of global dimension @xmath11 . for this reason ,",
    "the assumption that the surface cut algebras have global dimension @xmath11 is essential . while not all algebras constructed in this way have this property , we prove the following    any marked surface with non - empty boundary admits a triangulation and a cut such that the resulting cut algebra has global dimension @xmath11 .",
    "finally , we show that triangulations of punctured surfaces do not necessarily admit admissible cuts , which contrasts with the situation in the unpunctured case .",
    "@xmath23    * if @xmath3 has empty boundary and is not a sphere with less than @xmath24 punctures , and if @xmath2 is an ideal triangulation of @xmath3 for which every puncture has valency at least @xmath25 , then @xmath1 admits no admissible cuts . *",
