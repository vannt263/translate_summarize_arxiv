    "the signatures of host galaxys young stars and star formation are also present in optical and mid - ir spectra .",
    "these type 2 agn are therefore ideal laboratories for studying the connection between agn and star formation , provided that the tracers of this activity can be disentangled .",
    "multi - wavelength star formation indicators have been extensively studied in samples of quiescent star forming galaxies ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "star formation rates ( sfrs ) have been calibrated in the optical based on h@xmath1 emission , which results from recombination following ionization due to energetic photons from massive o and b stars , and in the uv based on the continuum which provides a window into emission from young stars .",
    "dust in the galaxy reprocesses optical and uv photons and re - radiates in the infrared ( ir ) , thus revealing obscured star formation .",
    "other ir indicators include emission from fine structure lines excited by starburst activity , such as [ neii ] 12.81@xmath2 m and [ neiii ] 15.56@xmath2 m @xcite , as well as spectral emission features associated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , since these macro - molecules / small - grains can be ionized by single optical or uv photons @xcite and are prominent in ir spectra of star - forming galaxies @xcite .",

    "then becomes a necessary intermediate step in using continuum ir emission as a tracer of star formation in active galaxies , and such a process can be plagued with uncertainties .",

    "we plot the [ nev]/[neii ] detections and stacked [ nev]/[neii ] upper limits against the optical d value , pah ew ( for the sub - set of sources where the pah luminosity was detected above the 5@xmath15 level ) and @xmath5 . for the stacked [ nev]/[neii ] ratios",
    ", we calculate the average d , pah ew and @xmath29 value in each bin .",
    "the [ nev ] stacked detection is illustrated by the triangle in the subsequent figures .",
    "figures [ nev_ne2_d_alpha ] - [ nev_ne2_ew ] illustrate the trends between [ nev]/[neii ] and the other diagnostics of radiation field hardness . as expected , [ nev]/[neii ] is significantly correlated with d and significantly anti - correlated with @xmath5 and pah ews , as seen in the correlation coefficients ( @xmath30 ) and associated probabilities that the two quantities are uncorrelated ( @xmath31 ) reported in table [ rel_agn_sfr ] .",
    "we note that one galaxy classified as a quiescent star - forming galaxy based on its optical ( sdss ) spectrum has a [ nev ] detection .",
    "this suggests that it is harboring a `` hidden '' agn , i.e. an agn embedded in very dusty host galaxy that attenuates the optical signatures used to identify agn .",
    "however , we note that this source has other ir parameters ( i.e. @xmath5 , pah ews ) more consistent with those of typical star - forming galaxies .",
    "this may argue against `` hidden '' agn interpretation , which may then call into question using solely [ nev ] detection as an unambiguous signature of agn activity .",
    "_ in any case , we emphasize that the optical and mid - ir classifications of galaxies as being dominated by star formation or by a type 2 agn agree in the overwhelming majority of cases .",
    "_ this is good news , since it shows that sdss classifications ( which are available for roughly one million galaxies ) are highly reliable .",
    "we do not find a large population of optically hidden agn , as found by goulding & alexander ( 2009 ) . over half of the [ nev ] detected sources in their volume limited sample of nearby galaxies",
    "are not optically classified as agn .",
    "however , they do not include optically classifed liners or composites as `` optically classified agn , '' while we do consider these to contain agn .",
    "the fraction of [ nev ] detected sources in their sample that are classified optically as quiescent star - forming galaxies is 24% ( 4 of 17 ) , which is still a substantially larger fraction than what we find .      the mid - ir spectral slope index , @xmath5 , increases with the relative amount of star formation @xcite .",
    "we plot @xmath5 as a function of the optical d parameter in figure [ alpha_d ] which shows that a wide range of @xmath5 values are present for the star - forming galaxies .",
    "consequently , there is no significant anti - correlation present in the full sample , with correlation coefficient ( @xmath30 ) of -0.195 .",
    "however , if we consider just the agn , a significant trend is apparent : @xmath30=-0.474 .",
    "this correspondence likely drives the significant anti - correlation found for [ nev]/[neii ] vs @xmath5 .",
    "the ir spectral index is thus useful in parameterizing the relative contribution of star formation in active galaxies but this appears to break down in the quiescent galaxy regime .",
    "consequently , we do not utilize @xmath5 as a tracer of ionization field hardness in the subsequent analysis .",
    "previous studies have indicated that the pah equivalent widths ( ews ) are anti - correlated with the presence of increasing agn activity .",
    "this can be due to two effects .",
    "first , as the agn becomes increasingly dominant energetically , the emission due to warm dust heated by the agn will rise .",
    "even if the intrinsic pah emission is unaffected , this increase in the mid - ir continuum flux will cause the pah ews to decrease .",
    "a second possible effect would be due to the actual destruction of dust grains by the hard ionization field from the agn central engine @xcite .",
    "our new expanded data set that spans the range from quiescent systems to strong agn provides the opportunity to test these processes over a full range of ionization field hardness and to test which features may be most sensitive to agn activity .",
    "figure [ ew_d ] plots the pah ew at 7.7 @xmath2 m , 11.3 @xmath2 m and 17@xmath2 m as a function of the optical d parameter .",
    "the relationship between d and the pah ews is significant , with @xmath32 - 0.65 ( table [ ew ] ) .",
    "however , if we focus on just the star - forming galaxies and composites , this significant anti - correlation disappears : @xmath30=-0.227 , -0.125 and -0.230 for the 7.7@xmath2 m , 11.3@xmath2 m and 17 @xmath2 m features , respectively .",
    "hence , it appears that only in the objects that are optically classified as agn is the pah ew appreciably affected , suggesting the agn contributes a significant fraction of the mid - ir continuum or perhaps destroys pahs .",
    "as noted above , the pah ew are sensitive to both the relative amount of mid - ir continuum from the agn as well as effects on the pah emission itself . a complementary approach that isolates",
    "the effect of the agn directly on the pah emission is to consider changes in the ratios of the different pah features as the agn becomes more dominant .",
    "thus , similar to the work of @xcite and @xcite , we investigate the relationship between radiation field hardness ( parameterized by [ nev]/[neii ] and d ) and the ratios of the pah fluxes in figures [ ratios_nev_ne2 ] and [ ratios_d ] .",
    "since the [ nev ] line is only detected in the optically - classifed agn ( with few exceptions ) , we compare d to the pah ratios for the agn subset alone , as well as for the full sample ( including star - forming and composite systems ) .",
    "qualitatively , it appears that the distribution of the agn are different in these figures from the star forming and composite objects . for the most agn - dominated sources ( d @xmath28 1.2 and log(l@xmath33}$]/l@xmath23}$ ] ) @xmath34 ) , there is a subset of the population that has abnormally low ratios of pah 11.3 @xmath0 to 17 @xmath0 and abormally high ratios of pah 7.7 @xmath0 to 11.3 @xmath0 .",
    "a similar but weaker effect is seen in the pah 7.7 @xmath0 to 17 @xmath0 ratios .",
    "these distributions do not appear to take the form of a gradual correlation across the whole galaxy population , but rather appear as a threshold effect at high values of d and log ( l@xmath33}$]/l@xmath23}$ ] ) .    despite this caveat , we have quantified the statistical significances of overall trends that may be present .",
    "we emphasize that the correlations may be weak , but the trends found can be quantified as statistically significant as indicated by the correlation coefficients ( @xmath30 ) listed in table [ pah_ratio ] .",
    "l@xmath35/l@xmath36 displays no significant trend with ionization hardness , regardless of the radiation field parameterization used and whether the full sample or agn only are considered .",
    "using [ nev]/[neii ] as a probe of the ionization field , a significant trend becomes apparent with l@xmath37/l@xmath36 ( @xmath30=-0.564 ) and l@xmath35/l@xmath37 ( @xmath30=0.611 ) .",
    "however , with d as a diagnostic of the incident radiation , the l@xmath37/l@xmath36 relationship becomes less significant in the full sample ( @xmath30=-0.364 ) and even less correlated for the agn sub - sampple ( @xmath30=-0.247 ) .",
    "l@xmath35/l@xmath37 is not significantly correlated in the full sample ( @xmath30=0.179 ) , but becomes more signficant in the agn sample ( @xmath30=0.431 ) .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that the pah feature at 11.3@xmath2 m is suppressed in agn - dominated systems relative to the 7.7 and 17 @xmath0 features .",
    "this disagrees with the results of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite who find that ratio of l@xmath35/l@xmath37 is smaller in agn than in star - forming galaxies .",
    "the disagreement with the first three studies listed above could result from the inclusion of a greater number of high - luminosity agn - dominated in our analysis .",
    "clearly , agn affect pah macro - molecules and this effect could be more pronounced in more luminous agn .",
    "the inconsistency with @xcite could be due to their seyfert sample being systematically closer .",
    "perhaps the agn effect on pahs are different in the region hundreds of parsecs around the central engine , as probed by the @xcite analysis , rather than the kiloparsec to galaxy - wide scale that we are investigating where there is a greater interplay between host galaxy star formation and agn activity .",
    "different screening effects at different physical scales may play an important role .",
    "more advanced theoretical work on the effect of the agn ionization field on pah macro - molecules would help to understand the physical causes of these inconsistencies .    because we have combined a number of different samples selected in different ways , our agn systems ( mostly drawn from the sdss [ oiii ] and 12@xmath2 m samples ) are typically at lower redshift than most of the star - forming and composite systems ( drawn from ssgss and s5 ) .",
    "could any of the results above be influenced by the systematic differences in the physical sizes being probed ( i.e. smaller scale nuclear emission in closeby agn versus larger scale host galaxy emission for sources further away ) ? to test this , we impose a redshift cut of z@xmath160.03 , which corresponds to the lowest redshift source in the ssgss sample .",
    "this cut eliminates most of the 12@xmath2 m sources and almost half of the [ oiii ] sample .",
    "however , since we do retain a handful of [ oiii]-selected agn which are strong agn , we are able to test the relationship between pah ews and ionization field hardness over a wide range of nuclear galactic activity .",
    "figure [ ew_d_z_cut ] and [ ratios_d_z_cut ] illustrate that the trends found for the full sample still hold for this pared down sample .",
    "the agn at higher d values are associated with suppressed pah ews at a statistically significant level even when the host galaxy is more fully sampled ( see table [ ew ] ) .",
    "the only change in the pah ratio analysis is the significant anti - correlation of l@xmath37/l@xmath36 with respect to d in the agn sub - sample ( see table [ pah_ratio ] ) .",
    "we note that though the l@xmath35/l@xmath37 trend is driven by a handful of agn , the relationship is similar to the parent dataset where the parameter space of high l@xmath35/l@xmath37 values is more fully sampled . the thresholds in d and [ nev]/[neii ] for changes in the pah ratios noted above",
    "are still present .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that some care be used when using the pah luminosities to estimate star formation rates in galaxies with dominant agn . the 11.3 @xmath0 feature appears to be rather strongly suppressed in the most agn - dominated systems .",
    "mid - infrared emission in active galaxies results from both the toroidal obscuring medium , accounting for @xmath1420% of the bolometric agn flux @xcite , and host galaxy star formation .",
    "we define l@xmath38 as the rest - frame luminosity at 13.5@xmath2 m averaged over a 3@xmath2 m window : this region is free from strong pah features and provides a reliable estimate of the mir continuum emission . using quiescent galaxies as a baseline to estimate the amount of mir emission due to star formation , we can empircally separate the contributions of starburst activity and toroidal emission . to quantify the relative importance of these two effects ,",
