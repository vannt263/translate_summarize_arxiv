    "carbon nanotubes ( cnts ) have been the focus of intense study in the last decades as they exhibit remarkable properties that make them good candidates for molecular electronic devices .",
    "@xcite lately their application as building blocks in spintronics has also been addressed .",
    "@xcite nonetheless the importance of spin - orbit coupling in these systems has been for a long time underestimated . the spin - orbit interaction ( soi )",
    "was believed to be very weak , due to the low atomic number @xmath0 of carbon . as a result",
    "spin degenerate states were assumed .",
    "only recently it was proven experimentally  @xcite that in the spectrum of ultraclean cnts the effects of this coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom are clearly visible .",
    "this observation is in agreement with previous theoretical predictions  @xcite which argued that soi could be significant in cnts owing to their curvature .",
    "understanding the effects of this coupling on the spectrum of cnts is essential for the successful manipulation of the different degrees of freedom of these systems .",
    "signatures of spin - orbit coupling in the magnetic field dependence of the spectrum have been further identified in measurements  @xcite of relaxation and dephasing times in a cnt quantum dot and more recently in magnetoconductance experiments  @xcite performed on open cnt - wires , showing a double - peak feature caused by a spin splitting of the conduction bands due to the soi .",
    "the observed spin - orbit energy splitting is compatible with previous experimental and theoretical values  @xcite and further supports the relevance of spin - orbit effects in these systems .",
    "moreover new transport measurements  @xcite in cnt quantum dots with magnetic fields both parallel and perpendicular to the nanotube serve to analyze the influence of soi also in the cotunneling regime .",
    "the application of a parallel magnetic field modulates the distribution of the electronic spectrum of nanotubes ,  @xcite as has been confirmed experimentally in several optical and transport measurements .",
    "@xcite further theoretical studies  @xcite reveal that the transport properties are directly related to the magnetic - field modulated density of states .",
    "the soi -modified band structure and its implications on the electronic properties of cnts in a magnetic field has been in the focus of extensive theoretical work  @xcite",
    ". however , at present only few theoretical works exist  @xcite which investigate quantum transport through cnts including magnetic field , curvature and soi effects .",
    "in this paper we analyze the transport properties of finite - size carbon nanotubes in a parallel magnetic field in the regime of strong nanotube - lead coupling , using a tight - binding hamiltonian for the nanotube system and green function techniques .",
    "@xcite a magnetic field parallel to the tube axis is included via the aharonov - bohm phase and zeeman effect , and we take into account the spin - orbit coupling , which is responsible for the appearance of a spin - splitting and of spin - flip processes . the spin - splitting may allow for preparation of states with controlled spin and valley ( the so - called isospin ) degrees of freedom .",
    "the inclusion of the soi and the magnetic field leads furthermore to the breaking of the electron - hole symmetry , as we notice in our analysis of these systems . without an electron - hole symmetry spin - up and spin - down states",
    "may cross the fermi energy at different magnetic fluxes giving rise to peaks in the magnetoconductance corresponding to spin - polarized currents around the fermi energy similar to those experimentally observed in ref .   and as identified in the present work .    for zigzag and chiral nanotubes",
    "the finite size of the systems leads to a localization of the states in the magnetic field with a consequent suppression of current .",
    "@xcite we show that , as a consequence of the soi , this localization starts at a threshold value of the magnetic field which is different for the two spin species .",
    "this value can be further tuned with the chirality , radius or length of the tube , allowing for controlled polarized states .",
    "furthermore we find that numerical transport calculations in finite - size cnts are to a very good extent reproduced by using an analytical model hamiltonian in the reciprocal space .",
    "the proper boundary conditions are crucial for the understanding of finite - size effects .",
    "the analytical approach provides as well a fundamental insight into the nature of the states taking part in the transport processes .",
    "part of the discussion on localization was presented in abridged form in ref .  .",
    "the scope of the present work is to analyze various consequences of soi on the transport characteristics of cnts strongly coupled to leads .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_theory ] we introduce the tight - binding approach that we use for modelling our system , where we keep the interactions to nearest neighbors only because , despite its simplicity , this approximation is known to provide a good agreement with experiments .",
    "@xcite our original tight - binding hamiltonian is modified to consecutively include the effects of an applied axial magnetic field , the curvature of the nanotube and the spin - orbit coupling . starting from this generalized tight - binding model for the real - space description of the cnts , an effective hamiltonian for the @xmath1 bands is obtained , which is formally the same as the one derived previously by other groups .",
    "@xcite this hamiltonian will allow us in sec .",
