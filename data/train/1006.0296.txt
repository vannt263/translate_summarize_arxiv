    "the observation of the supernovae of type ia ( sn ia ) @xcite provides the evidence that the universe is undergoing accelerated expansion . jointing current cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropy measurement from wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and the data of the large scale structure ( lss ) from sdss @xcite ,",
    "one concludes that there exists an exotic energy component with negative pressure , dubbed dark energy , whose density accounts for two - thirds of the total energy density in the universe at present .",
    "the simplest but most natural candidate of dark energy is the cosmological constant @xmath11 , with the constant equation of state @xmath12 .",
    "in fact , the observational data is mostly consistent with the predictions of the @xmath10 model @xcite .",
    "however , it suffers the so - called fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problems . to avoid these problems ,",
    "dynamic dark energy models are considered as an alternative scenario , such as quintessence @xcite , phantom @xcite , quintom @xcite and holographic dark energy @xcite etc .",
    "although more and more dark energy models have been presented , the nature of dark energy is still a conundrum . under such circumstances , the models which are built according to some fundamental principle are more charming , such as holographic dark energy model and agegraphic dark energy model @xcite .",
    "the former one is on the basis of holographic principle , and the latter one is derived from taking the combination between the uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics and general relativity into account . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the holographic dark energy model , which is considered as a dynamic vacuum energy and constructed by considering the holographic principle and some features of quantum gravity theory .",
    "according to the holographic principle , the number of degrees of freedom in a bounded system should be finite and has relations with the area of its boundary . by applying the principle to cosmology ,",
    "one can obtain the upper bound of the entropy contained in the universe . for a system with size @xmath13 and uv cut - off @xmath14 without decaying into a black hole , it is required that the total energy in a region of size @xmath13 should not exceed the mass of a black hole of the same size , thus @xmath15 .",
    "the largest @xmath13 allowed is the one saturating this inequality , thus @xmath16 where c is a numerical constant and @xmath17 is the reduced planck mass @xmath18 .",
    "it just means a duality between uv cut - off and ir cut - off .",
    "the uv cut - off is related to the vacuum energy , and ir cut - off is related to the large scale of the universe , for example hubble horizon , event horizon or particle horizon as discussed by @xcite .    in the paper @xcite , the author took the future event horizon @xmath19 as the ir cut - off @xmath13 .",
    "although this model is confronted with the causality problem , as pointed out in @xcite , it can reveal the dynamic nature of the vacuum energy and provide a solution to the fine tuning and cosmic coincidence problem .",
    "when @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the holographic dark energy behaves like quintessence , cosmological constant and phantom respectively .",
    "therefore , in this model , the value of parameter @xmath23 plays an important role in determining the property of holographic dark energy .",
    "then , a model with holographic dark energy proportional to the ricci scalar was proposed by gao , et .",
    "al . in @xcite , called the ricci dark energy ( rde ) . in that paper @xcite , it has shown that this model can avoid the causality problem and naturally solve the coincidence problem of dark energy after ricci scalar is regarded as the @xmath24 cut - off @xmath25 : @xmath26    an fascinating aspect in the study of dark energy is that the cosmological parameters in a given model can be constrained by the increasing observational data .",
    "it is found that the best way to constrain is using the combination of a thorough observation .",
    "now we give a brief review of the previous works on the combined observational constraints of the ricci dark energy model . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we constrained the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 using 192 sn ia data @xcite from the essence @xcite and gold sets @xcite , the cmb shift parameter @xmath29 from three - year wmap data @xcite , and the bao parameter @xmath30 from sdss @xcite , obtaining the best - fittings : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "subsequently , the authors in ref . @xcite utilized the latest 307 union snia data from the supernova cosmology project ( scp ) , the updated shift parameter @xmath29 from the five - year wmap data @xcite , and the independent form of the sdss bao parameter @xmath30 @xcite to constrain the parameters @xmath27 and @xmath28 , whose best - fit values are given by @xmath33 and @xmath34 in @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the sdss bao parameter @xmath30 is replaced by the measurement of @xmath35 from sdss @xcite to investigate the generalized ricci dark energy model . then li , et .",

    ", we will revisit the rde model and make a thorough investigation on this model with a completely consistent analysis of the combined observations . comparing with the previous works , we use the more complete combinations of the observational datasets from the x - ray gas mass fraction in clusters of galaxies ( cbf ) @xcite , 397 sn ia @xcite data , the bao measurement on the values of @xmath39 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix in @xcite , the cmb observation @xcite on the maximum likelihood values of @xmath37 $ ] and their inverse covariance matrix and the observational hubble data at fifteen different redshifts , including the three more observational data @xmath40 and @xmath41 in @xcite and the observational data @xcite .",
    "we carry out the global fitting on the rde model using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method .",
    "in addition , in this paper we do not only perform the constraint on the parameters in the flat rde model , but also in the non - flat rde model , comparing with the constraint results in the standard concordance model by using the same combined datasets .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in next section",
    ", we briefly review the rde model . in section iii , we describe the method and data .",
    "after we perform the cosmic observation constraint , the results on the determination of the cosmological parameters are presented .",
