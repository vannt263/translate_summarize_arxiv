    "quarks and gluons have never been observed as free particles , a phenomenon known as color confinement .",
    "a widely accepted idea in the 1960 s was that a limiting temperature exists for hadronic matter@xcite , the hagedorn temperature @xmath1 : increasing the energy density just below @xmath1 would result in production of particles , rather than in an increase of temperature . in ref.@xcite it was suggested that a phase transition could exist to a plasma of quarks and gluons ( deconfining transition ) .",
    "big experiments to explore this possibility in heavy ions collisions have not yet given conclusive results@xcite .",
    "the only existing source of information are montecarlo simulations of the theory on the lattice .",
    "the partition function of a system of fields at temperature t @xmath2 is equal to the euclidean feynmann integral of the theory extending in time from 0 to @xmath3 , with periodic boundary conditions in time for bosons , antiperiodic for fermions . in the lattice formulation",
    "this corresponds to simulate the theory on a lattice @xmath4 , with the spatial extension @xmath5 , the time extension .",
    "the temperature is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the lattice spacing in physical units .    to explore the deconfining transition a signature for confinement - deconfinement",
    "must be defined . in quenched qcd ( @xmath9 , no dynamical quarks",
    ") this is done as follows .",
    "consider the polyakov line @xmath10 the correlator @xmath11 is related to the static @xmath12 potential by the relation @xmath13 on the other hand at large distances cluster property requires @xmath14 when @xmath15 eq([eq5 ] ) gives a linearily rising potential at large distances , @xmath16 which is taken as a definition of confinement .",
    "when @xmath17 , @xmath18 and there is no confinement .",
    "@xmath19 is an order parameter for confinement , the corresponding symmetry being @xmath20 .",
    "a deconfining phase transition is indeed observed in lattice simulations , corresponding to the above definition , both in @xmath21 and in @xmath22 pure gauge theories : @xmath19 grows rapidly from 0 to 1 by increasing @xmath23 at some @xmath24 . in a finite lattice ,",
    "however , the growth of @xmath19 is smooth : no phase transition can take place in a finite system @xcite .",
    "the raise of @xmath19 becomes sharper and sharper as the volume increases .",
    "the infinite volume limit can be studied by a technique used in statistical mechanics @xcite , known as finite size scaling analysis .",
    "the susceptibility of the order parameter @xmath25 can be defined at a given spatial size @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath25 gives a measure of the slope of the increase of @xmath28 at @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath29 it diverges with some critical index @xmath30 when approaching @xmath24 from below @xmath31 the correlation length @xmath32 of the order parameter @xmath28 also diverges at the critical point with a critical index @xmath33 @xmath34 assuming that the ratio @xmath35 is an analytic function , as @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the scaling law follows @xmath38 or @xmath39 the dependence on @xmath26 is dictated by the critical indices of the transition .",
    "in particular the value of @xmath25 at the peak @xmath40 scales as @xmath41 a similar discussion gives for the specific heat @xmath42 @xmath43 with @xmath44 the corresponding critical index and @xmath45 an additive term due to the presence of an additive renormalization . by studying numerically the dependence of @xmath25 and @xmath42 on @xmath26 the critical indices @xmath44 , @xmath30",
    ", @xmath33 can be determined and the order of the transition and the universality class with them .",
    "a weak first order transition is a limiting case when @xmath46 and @xmath47 with @xmath48 the number of spatial dimensions .",
    "for quenched @xmath21 it is found that the universality class is that of the @xmath49 ising model , and @xmath50@xcite . for quenched @xmath22",
    "the transition is weak first order @xcite and @xmath51 .",
    "an alternative order parameter @xmath52 is the vev of a magnetically charged operator@xcite .",
    "this operator will be described in some detail in the next section for full qcd .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis of @xmath53 gives results consistent with those obtained by using @xmath19 and @xmath54 for @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath57 .    since @xmath58 signals dual superconductivity , this result can be considered as evidence that dual superconductivity of the vacuum is the mechanism of confinement .",
    "in the presence of dynamical quarks a clear way to define and to detect confinement does not exist .",
    "@xmath19 is not a good order parameter , since the corresponding symmetry @xmath20 is broken by the quark coupling .",
    "in addition string breaking is expected to occur : the static potential energy converts into dynamical @xmath59 pairs at large distances so that the potential is not linear any more with the distance , even if there can be confinement .    at @xmath60",
    "chiral symmetry exists , which is spontaneously broken at @xmath61 , the pseudoscalar mesons being the corresponding goldstone particles and the quark condensate @xmath62 the order parameter . at some critical temperature @xmath63",
    "mev chiral symmetry is restored .",
    "it is not well understood what is the interplay of chiral symmetry with confinement .",
    "moreover at @xmath64 chiral symmetry is explicitely broken and @xmath62 is not a good order parameter either .",
    "however if one looks at susceptibilities like @xmath65 they all show in numerical simulations a maximum for a @xmath66 as functions of @xmath23 , along a line in the plane @xmath67 , which is assumed by convention as a critical line , with the confined phase below it and the deconfined phase above it@xcite@xcite .          a renormalization group analysis of the chiral transition at @xmath69 @xcite leads to the following predictions , based on the hypothesis that the golstone particles are the relevant degrees of freedom at the transition .",
    "for @xmath70 or @xmath71 the transition is first order , and such is expected to be for @xmath72 . for @xmath0",
    "the transition is first order both at @xmath73 and at @xmath74 if the axial @xmath75 broken by the anomaly is restored at a lower temperature than chiral symmetry , it is second order if the anomaly persists up to the chiral transition , and in that case the line in fig.1 is a crossover .",
    "there exists no precise numerical analysis of the order of the transition , but for some reason the second possibility is usually accepted",
    ".    one can assume dual superconductivity of the vacuum as a criterion for confinement .",
    "this criterion works in the quenched case , where it is consistent with the one based on @xmath19 @xcite . to be rigorous one should prove that dual superconductivity implies confinement of any colored particle . in the same way , however , one should prove that @xmath15 implies confinement of any colored particle .",
    "dual superconductivity is detected by a disorder parameter @xmath76 , the vev of an operator carrying non zero magnetic charge@xcite.a non zero vev of @xmath77 signals higgs breaking of magnetic u(1 ) symmetry , or dual superconductivity .",
    "we shall recall below the definition and some properties of @xmath77 .",
    "numerical simulations show indeed that vacuum is a dual superconductor in the region of fig  1 below the critical line , and is normal above it@xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath77 is defined@xcite by the orbits @xmath78 in the gauge group of the symmetric space defined by the co - roots @xmath79 the definition is @xmath80 each choice of @xmath81 defines an abelian projection@xcite , and with it monopoles .",
    "the operator @xmath77 creates a monopole in the given abelian projection .",
    "it can be shown@xcite@xcite , however , that the property of @xmath82 of being non - zero or zero is abelian projection independent , if the number density of monopoles is finite .",
    "numerical simulations show that this is indeed the case .",
    "if one looks at the distribution of the difference of eigenvalues of operators in the adjoint representation on the lattice sites , the number of sites in which that difference vanishes is zero .",
    "that difference is equal to zero at the locations of monopoles . a large sample of configurations , lattice spacings , and operators",
    "have been studied .",
    "a finite size scaling analysis allows to determine the critical indices and the order of the transition@xcite the problem has two scales , the correlation length and the quark mass so that neglecting the ratio of the lattice spacing to the correlation length , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the anomalous dimension of @xmath85 . by choosing values of @xmath85 and @xmath26 such that the second argument is constant",
    "a scaling law follows for the susceptibility @xmath86 whence @xmath33 can be extracted .",
    "the result is consistent with a first order thansition ( @xmath51)@xcite",
    ".    this determination should be consistent with the scaling of the specific heat eq(12 ) .",
    "preliminary data show that this is the case indeed@xcite .",
    "further numerical work is on the way to put the result on a firm basis .",
    "this would definitely legitimate the assumption of @xmath52 as an order parameter for confinement , and confirm dual superconductivity as a mechanism for color confinement .",
    "it would also imply@xcite that either axial @xmath75 symmetry is restored before chiral symmetry , or that goldstone particles are not the relevant degrees of freedom at the critical point .",
    "the first possibility can also be tested on the lattice .",
