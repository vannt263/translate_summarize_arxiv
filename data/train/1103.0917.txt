    "nematic liquid crystals ( nematics ) are materials which prefer in some temperature range a uniaxial mean orientational ordering of their non - spherical molecules , while the positional order is fluid - like . the locally preferred axis is described by the director field @xmath2 with @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the basic equilibrium state , in the absence of external stresses , corresponds to a spatially uniform director configuration , where the orientational elastic free energy , @xmath4 , with respect to @xmath5 takes a minimum .",
    "thus spatial variations of @xmath2 , which can be decomposed into splay , twist and bend distortions with the elastic constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , respectively , lead to an increase of @xmath4 , i.e. , to torques on @xmath2 to restore equilibrium . in the presence of an electric field , @xmath9 , and in non - equilibrium configurations electric torques on the director",
    "have to be considered as well .",
    "they originate from a nonzero electric polarization , @xmath10 , which contains at first the standard dielectric contribution @xmath11 .",
    "the dielectric tensor , @xmath12 , which depends on the local director orientation , is governed by the two dielectric permittivities @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath9 parallel and perpendicular to @xmath2 , respectively ; @xmath15 denotes the vacuum permittivity .",
    "furthermore , in a rough analogy to the piezo - electric polarization of certain insulators due to mechanical strains , director distortions lead also to the so called flexo polarization , @xmath16 , characterized by the two flexo coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "if the electric field is strong enough the balance of electric and elastic torques may even require spatially periodic director variations where typically the flexoelectric torques play a crucial role .",
    "the main goal of this paper is a detailed study of the resulting patterns , which are easily detected by optical means due to the accompanying variations of the refraction index .",
    "our analysis is restricted to the mostly used _ planar _",
    "director configuration , which is very convenient for experimental and theoretical studies . in this case a uniform basic state is achieved by sandwiching a thin nematic layer between two plates ( parallel to the @xmath19 plane ) , which may also serve as electrodes for the application of a transverse electric field @xmath9 . by a suitable treatment of the plate surfaces",
    "the same in - plane director orientation @xmath20 is enforced at the confining plates , which then persists throughout the whole layer in the basic state . before concentrating on the impact of the flexo torque we will briefly touch on the familiar consequences of the dielectric torque .",
    "it is destabilizing for a _ positive _ dielectric anisotropy , @xmath21 , in the planar case . thus above a certain field",
    "amplitude the compensation of the dielectric torque by the stabilizing elastic one becomes impossible and the _ freedericksz transition _ takes place : the director experiences a distortion in the @xmath22 plane , maximal at the midplane of the nematic layer @xcite .",
    "the resulting director variation is in most cases uniform in the plane of the layer and varies only in the @xmath23-direction . only in some exceptional cases , when @xmath24 , the homogeneous freedericksz transition for @xmath25 is replaced by the so called splay - twist freedericksz transition which leads to director distortions in the form of stripes parallel to @xmath26 .",
    "we are only aware of one experimental realization @xcite , since almost exclusively @xmath27 for nematics . just for completeness , we mention that during the temporal evolution of the homogeneous freedericksz state _ transient stripe patterns _ parallel to the @xmath28-axis have also been described @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the effect of a finite flexo polarization , which provides a robust mechanism ( independent on the sign of @xmath29 ) to generate stripe patterns ( _ flexodomains _ ) parallel to @xmath26 as well .",
    "the pattern forming instability of the basic state takes place when the flexo torque ( @xmath30 ) is sufficiently strong compared with the elastic and dielectric torques @xcite .",
    "flexodomains are indeed observed in several nematic materials ; also for @xmath31 , where a freedericksz transition is excluded @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present a comprehensive analysis of the flexodomains in the presence of an electric field @xmath32 , both in the dc - case ( circular frequency @xmath33 ) and the ac - case for small @xmath0 .",
    "unfortunately a previous analysis of the dc - case @xcite suffers from a serious error .",
    "so far we have concentrated on _ equilibrium transitions _ driven by an electric field , which are governed by a minimization principle of the free energy . in nematics , however , we find often under the term electro - hydrodynamic convection ( ec ) a _ non - equilibrium , dissipative transition _ from the basic state towards a periodic arrangement of convection rolls .",
    "since the resulting stripes run rather perpendicular to the initial director orientation @xmath26 they are easily distinguishable from the flexodomains .",
    "the mechanism of ec , which has been first elucidated by carr and helfrich @xcite in pioneering papers , has been comprehensively discussed in a number of reviews in the last years ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . some new aspects of the effect of flexoelectricity on ec will be given in section  [ sec : ec ] of this paper .",
    "an interesting feature of our system is the possibility to switch between an equilibrium pattern - forming instability ( flexodomains ) and the dissipative ec instability just by tuning the ac - frequency @xmath0 .",
    "this scenario has indeed been observed in recent experiments on certain nematics @xcite : in the dc - case and at very small @xmath0 one finds flexodomains , before ec takes over at increasing @xmath0 .",
    "systematic theoretical analyzes , however , are practically missing so far . to provide",
    "those has been an important issue of our work . in section",
    "[ sec : basic_eqns ] we will briefly comment on the mathematical background of our theoretical investigations . section  [ sec : pikin ] is devoted to the flexodomains . in section",
    "[ sec : ec ] we concentrate on ec at low frequencies in comparison with the transition to flexodomains .",
    "it will become obvious that in particular the limit @xmath1 is far from trivial and requires a careful analysis .",
    "the paper concludes with some final remarks .",
    "our starting point is a nematic layer ( parallel to the @xmath19 plane ) of thickness @xmath34 under the action of the applied potential @xmath35 in the @xmath23-direction . in the quiescent basic state",
    "the director field is homogeneous throughout the layer ( @xmath36 ) and flow is absent .",
    "pattern forming instabilities are associated with a distortion , @xmath37 , of @xmath26 .",
    "they lead often to flow ( @xmath38 ) and to a perturbation , @xmath39 , of the applied voltage @xmath40 . since both the planar director orientation at @xmath41 and @xmath40 are considered to be fixed , the conditions @xmath42 and @xmath43 have to be fulfilled at the confining plates ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "this applies also to @xmath44 under the realistic assumption of no - slip at the boundaries .",
    "the general theoretical framework to analyze electrically driven pattern forming instabilities in nematic liquid crystals is well established in terms of the standard nemato - hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "the electric field distribution is determined by the maxwell equations in the electro - quasi - static approximation . as material parameters",
    "we need the dielectric permittivities @xmath13 , @xmath14 , the electric conductivities @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( for @xmath2 parallel and perpendicular to the electric field @xmath9 ) , and the flexo coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the director dynamics is driven by elastic and electric torques ; in the presence of flow also viscous torques have to be taken into account .",
    "the velocity field is determined by the ( generalized ) navier - stokes equation , where the viscous stress tensor depends on the orientation of @xmath2 with respect to @xmath44 and its gradients . for explicit calculations",
    "one needs the values of the elastic constants @xmath47 and furthermore the five independent viscosity coefficients @xmath48 to quantify the stress tensor and the viscous torques .",
    "it is natural to introduce dimensionless material parameters of order one ( labeled by primes ) .",
    "they appear then in the non - dimensionalized basic equations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) and are usually defined as follows : @xmath49 with @xmath50 for quantitative calculations in this paper we refer to the standard nematic mbba @xcite , which has been used in many experimental investigations in the past",
    ". the material parameters of mbba are well known ; for instance , for the analysis of flexodomains we use the following dimensionless elastic and electric constants ( the primes are omitted ) : @xmath51 by using eq .",
    "( [ eq : scale ] ) it is conventional to measure lengths in units of @xmath52 , time in units of @xmath53 , and to introduce a dimensionless control parameter @xmath54 instead of the voltage amplitude @xmath55 , where @xmath56 to describe the onset behavior of the pattern forming instabilities the nemato - hydrodynamic equations are linearized about the basic state . as a result we arrive at a linear system of coupled partial differential equations in the variables @xmath28 , @xmath57 , @xmath23 , @xmath58 for the perturbations @xmath59 , @xmath44 , and @xmath39 .",
    "since the lateral extensions of the nematic layer are much larger than the layer thickness @xmath34 , periodic boundary conditions in the layer plane are appropriate . by switching accordingly with respect to",
    "the planar coordinates @xmath60 to fourier space @xmath61 , one gets the linear equations in the form to be found in the appendix of @xcite ; a simplified version to analyze the flexodomains will be presented explicitly in section  [ sec : pikin ] . as already explained ,",
    "the perturbations @xmath37 , @xmath44 , @xmath39 are assumed to vanish at @xmath62 ; this is guaranteed by expanding these fields in terms of a complete set of galerkin trial functions which vanish at @xmath63 in dimensionless units .",
    "for instance the director component @xmath64 is represented as : @xmath65 with @xmath66 $ ] .",
    "we have tested that using a truncation parameter @xmath67 yields already data to an accuracy of better than @xmath68 ; in many cases even @xmath69 is sufficient .",
    "introducing the symbolic vector @xmath70 for the expansion coefficients @xmath71 , @xmath72 [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : nzq ] ) ] and the corresponding ones for @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 we arrive after projection onto the trial functions at a linear system of coupled ordinary differential equations of the following form : @xmath76 the matrices @xmath77 and @xmath78 are periodic with the ac - voltage period @xmath79 .",
    "the general solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) have the floquet representation @xmath80 with @xmath81 , where @xmath82 defines the floquet exponent .",
    "we are interested in time - periodic solutions @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath82 has to be purely imaginary of the form @xmath84 with co - prime integers @xmath85 . as a result",
    "the period of @xmath83 is given as @xmath86 if @xmath87 and as @xmath88 if @xmath89 .",
    "for a given @xmath90 periodic solutions exist only for a discrete set of control parameters @xmath91 etc .",
    "minimizing @xmath92 with respect to @xmath90 yields the critical wavevector @xmath93 and the critical control parameter @xmath94 at which the quiescent basic state becomes unstable . in the context of the present paper",
    "the destabilizing modes at onset had always the period @xmath88 , i.e. , they are characterized by @xmath95 .",
    "we have used two methods to calculate the periodic solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) .",
    "one option is to expand @xmath96 into a ( truncated ) fourier series in terms of @xmath97 with @xmath98 .",
    "then eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) transforms into an algebraic linear eigenvalue problem for the fourier coefficients , from which we obtain @xmath92 ( for more details see @xcite ) . as will be documented below the time variations in @xmath83",
    "become increasingly sharper with decreasing @xmath0 ; consequently many fourier modes up to @xmath99 had to be eventually kept . thus , in an alternative , less time consuming approach , we construct numerically the matrix solution @xmath100 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) for the initial condition @xmath101 where @xmath102 denotes the unit matrix ( see , e.g. , @xcite and for a recent application @xcite ) .",

    ". a periodic solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) with period @xmath88 exists when @xmath106 .",
    "the smallest @xmath54 to fulfill this condition yields again @xmath107 . as demonstrated in @xcite , the general nemato - hydrodynamic equations as used in this paper ,",
    "are invariant against a reflection @xmath108 at the midplane combined with a translation in time by half a period @xmath109 .",
    "thus the solution manifold of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vsym ] ) naturally splits into separate classes with different parity @xmath110 , for which the notions `` conductive '' ( @xmath111 ) and `` dielectric '' ( @xmath112 ) , respectively , have been introduced . for instance with respect to the director component @xmath113",
    "one finds @xmath114 ( for more details , see @xcite ) .",
    "this means that for the dielectric symmetry the time average of @xmath115 vanishes , while it is finite for the conductive symmetry .",
    "in the following we will investigate the bifurcation to flexodomains which leads to stripe patterns with the wavevector @xmath116 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath40 is not modified , i.e. , @xmath117 .",
    "inspection of the full nemato - hydrodynamic equations ( for instance in @xcite ) , shows that time variations of the director at nonzero @xmath0 lead in principle to a `` back flow '' which acts back onto the director in the form of viscous torques .",
    "they lead to small corrections to the dielectric and flexo torques of the order @xmath118 , with the miesowicz coefficient @xmath119 .",
    "since @xmath120 for mbba and similar nematics , the viscous torques are safely neglected in this paper , which also facilitates the quasi - analytical approaches in section  [ sec : acflexo ] below . moreover ,",
    "this approximation has been validated by full numerical studies of the basic equations .",
    "it is convenient to introduce instead of the elastic constants @xmath6 , @xmath7 their average value , @xmath121 , and their relative deviation , @xmath122 , from @xmath121 as follows : @xmath123 where obviously @xmath124 .",
    "in contrast to the rod - like nematics like mbba where @xmath125 , i.e. , @xmath126 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : mat ] ) ] , discotic nematics are characterized by @xmath127 ( @xmath128 ) @xcite .",
    "thus our analysis will cover negative @xmath122 for completeness as well . neglecting the back flow effects ( @xmath129 ) the director dynamics in flexodomains",
    "is only determined by dielectric and flexo torques .",
    "we start from the linear perturbations @xmath130 of the basic state in position space and switch to fourier space using the ( real ) ansatz : @xmath131 as a consequence the general equations ( [ eq : vsym ] ) reduce to the following linear system of coupled partial differential equations ( pde s ) in the variables @xmath23 and @xmath58 for the fourier components @xmath132 and @xmath133 :    [ eqn : nyz ] @xmath134 \\bar{n}_y   \\nonumber \\\\ & + p \\left [ { \\text{sgn}}(e_1 -e_3 ) u \\cos(\\omega t )      - 2 \\delta k \\partial_{z } \\right ] \\bar{n}_z \\ ; , \\label{eq : ny}\\\\   \\partial_t \\bar{n}_z & =   -\\left [ p^2 ( 1 - \\delta k ) - \\mu u^2 \\cos^2(\\omega t )   - ( 1 + \\delta k ) \\partial_{zz } \\right ] \\bar{n}_z \\nonumber \\\\ & + p \\left [ { \\text{sgn}}(e_1 -e_3 ) u \\cos(\\omega t )      + 2 \\delta k \\partial_{z } \\right ] \\bar{n}_y \\;. \\label{eq : nz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    instead of the time scale @xmath135 and the main control parameter @xmath54 [ eq .",

    "thus the whole system is represented as an equivalent circuit diagram ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) where the total voltage applied to the cell is different from `` theoretical '' results like @xmath425 , which represent only the voltage drop over the nematic layer .",
    "the necessary corrections to @xmath425 are not easy to model and would also require systematic measurements on the empty cell . finally the coexistence between flexodomains and ec pattern in the nonlinear regime when their linear thresholds are comparable has to be investigated .",
