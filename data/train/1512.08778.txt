    "first , given a complex @xmath123 with a filtration @xmath14 , we introduce the filtered dual complex @xmath207 , equipped with a filtration @xmath208 by taking @xmath209 where @xmath210 is the subspace of @xmath211 consisting of all the linear functionals that are zero over @xmath212 .",

    "hence , the reflection induces a filtered isomorphism @xmath223 where the shifts are given by the fact that @xmath224 and @xmath225 .",
    "now , from lemma 14.1.11 in @xcite , we have the filtered quasi - isomorphism @xmath226 combining these two relations and observing that @xmath227 leads to the filtered quasi - isomorphism @xmath228    proposition [ prop : mirror ] says that @xmath229 for every @xmath30",
    ". then we can prove equation : @xmath230 if we define @xmath231 as the unique integer such that @xmath232 then we have proved that @xmath233 in particular for a knot @xmath38 , where @xmath234 , we have @xmath235",

    "@xmath23 and @xmath24 , the function @xmath28 of the connected sum @xmath22 is the convolution product of the @xmath28 functions of @xmath23 and @xmath24 ; in other words @xmath241 this equation is very hard to prove in the grid diagram settings , but it has been proved quite easily using the holomorphic definition of link floer homology .",
    "in fact ozsvth and szab proved that , if @xmath7 is a heegaard diagrams for @xmath8 and @xmath242 denotes the link floer complex , there is a filtered chain homotopy equivalence @xmath243 which gives that @xmath244 .",
    "see section 7 in @xcite .",
    "we see immediately that the homology and the @xmath28 function of @xmath22 are independent from the choice of the components used to perform the connected sum ; moreover the @xmath0-invariant is additive : @xmath245      the disjoint union of two links @xmath23 and @xmath24 is equivalent to @xmath246 .",

    "moreover , quasi - alternating links are both khovanov and link floer homology thin ; which means that their homology is supported in a line and it is completely determined by the signature and the jones ( alexander in the hat version of link floer homology ) polynomial .",
