    "the sample of @xmath0 pairs produced in z decays at lep has been extensively mined as a source of data for precision electroweak measurements as well as searches for anomalies , including cp violation arising from sources other than the ckm matrix .",
    "the short lifetime of the @xmath0 and the rather large catalog of decay modes open up analysis possibilities which are not available for the other leptons at lep energies . in this note",
    ", we survey the measurements of @xmath0 couplings to the z , the w , and the photon carried out using about @xmath1 of data collected near the z peak by the l3 detector from 19911995 .",
    "measurements of the vector and axial - vector coupling constants of the @xmath0 provide a crucial test of the hypothesis of lepton universality , and , if universality holds , may be combined with other electroweak data to extract a precise measurement of the weak mixing angle .",
    "in addition , new physics , possibly including cp violation , may appear in @xmath2 couplings as unexpectedly large values of weak magnetic and electric dipole moments .",
    "the partial width and forward - backward asymmetry measurements for @xmath3 are described in great detail elsewhere  @xcite , and here we reiterate only a few points . the partial width , @xmath4 ,",
    "is related to the effective vector and axial - vector couplings by , @xmath5 the forward - backward asymmetry , @xmath6 is defined as , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the angle between the @xmath9 and beam electron .",
    "this asymmetry is related to the coupling constants by @xmath10 , where the polarization parameter @xmath11 is defined by , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an electron or @xmath0 .",
    "measurements of these quantities are combined with the @xmath0 longitudinal polarization measurement described below to determine @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",

    "thus from this single measurement it is possible to determine almost independently the couplings of the z to both the @xmath0 and the electron .",
    "also note that the polarization parameters contain products of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which means that , in contrast to the measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath6 , this measurement is sensitive to the relative sign of these coupling constants .",
    "the strategy of the measurement is to use the energy and angular distributions of the decay products to infer the longitudinal polarization based upon the assumption that @xmath0 decays proceed via purely @xmath25 interactions .",
    "the l3 analysis  @xcite employs three complementary approaches .",
    "first , a selection of exclusive decays is carried out , where we consider the channels @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) . the polarization for each channel",
    "is evaluated independently .",
    "second , an analysis of inclusive hadronic decays is performed which recovers some of the information lost for cases in which exclusive identification in hadronic modes is not successful .",
    "third , the polarization is determined from the acollinearity between decay products for events in which there is at least one @xmath30 decay .",
    "results from the three methods are combined accounting for the correlations among them .",

    "this is consistent with lepton universality .",
    "2.5 truein    -.2 cm    assuming universality and combining the longitudinal polarization results with the couplings determined from @xmath4 and @xmath6 yields the following preliminary results  @xcite : @xmath35      correlations between transverse and normal spin components of the two @xmath0 s in a @xmath3 event are also sensitive to @xmath0z couplings . in terms of the spin components depicted in figure  [ fig : spin ] ,",

    "these moments are zero at tree - level but acquire small contributions from loops , leading to the following predictions  @xcite : @xmath52 such tiny values are beyond the experimental reach of lep , but observation of a significant non - zero value would unambiguously signal new physics .",
    "in particular , a non - zero value of @xmath53 would imply cp violation in the decay @xmath3 .",

    "semileptonic decays can be described in a similar way : @xmath72 where in the case of @xmath73 , @xmath74 is a quantity constructed from the energies and angles of the @xmath75 decay products which maximizes sensitivity to @xmath76  @xcite .",
