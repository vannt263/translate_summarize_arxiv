    "the well established model of the interaction of elementary particles , the standard model ( sm ) , is incomplete as it can not explain some of the well known phenomena of fundamental physics .",
    "one such phenomenon is the dominance of matter over antimatter in our universe , although the sm treats matter and antimatter exactly in the same way @xcite .",
    "the violation of two fundamental symmetries : inversion symmetry ( p ) and charge conjugation ( c ) , is one of the several conditions that can explain the matter antimatter asymmetry @xcite .",
    "the cp violation within the sm originating from the complex quark mixing kobayashi - maskawa matrix is too weak to explain such an asymmetry .",
    "therefore , the search for an extra cp violation ( flavour - diagonal cp violation ) , which is absent in the sm is needed to explore new physics beyond the conventional sm @xcite .",
    "another fundamental symmetry is the time - reversal ( t ) symmetry , which is also violated with the violation of cp symmetry though a direct observation of the violation of t symmetry is yet to observe @xcite .",
    "the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of any elementary particle is a consequence of violation of both t and p as dipole moment is odd under p and even under t but spin is even under p and odd under t @xcite .",
    "according to sm , the electron edm is too small ( less than 10@xmath2 ) to observe experimentally @xcite .",
    "therefore , a measurable non zero edm of electron would be the proof of an extra cp violation and the first direct observation of t violation @xcite .",
    "however , the intensive search for the electron edm over the period of half a century have not drawn any conclusion to the final value of electron edm , which would have out - turned in the upper bound limit of the electron edm for different quantum systems . till date , the best limit of electron edm in an atomic system is achieved from the tl atom experiment ( @xmath3 e cm ) @xcite .",
    "however , the discovery of sandars @xcite reveals that the effective internal electric field experienced by an electron is profoundly enhanced in heavy - atom containing polar molecule which makes these polar diatomics very promising candidate in the search of the p- and p , t -violating experiments and creates a dimension to explore new physics .",
    "the latest best upper limit of electron edm is set from the tho experiment ( @xmath4 e cm ) by acme collaboration @xcite .",
    "this limit is one order lower in magnitude than the previous best limit ( @xmath5 e cm ) , which is obtained from the molecular ybf experiment @xcite .",
    "another advantage of using diatomic molecules in the search of electron edm is the @xmath6 doublet structure of the ground and metastable state of such polar diatomic molecules , which gives an additional enhancement and due to this reason different molecules having @xmath7 ground state ( ybf @xcite , hgf @xcite , hgh , baf @xcite ) , @xmath8 ground state ( pbf @xcite ) , @xmath9 metastable state ( tho @xcite , thf@xmath10 @xcite , hfh@xmath10 @xcite , pth@xmath10 @xcite , wc @xcite ) et cetera have been proposed . among these molecules ,",
    "pbf has some interesting characteristics , which make it a strong candidate in the search of electron edm .",
    "pb is neither a lanthanide or actinide f element nor a transition d element and pbf has a @xmath8 ground state , which means the unpaired electron is in the @xmath11 orbital while in most of the other molecules , the unpaired electron is in the @xmath12 orbital in their ground state .",
    "pbf , being a @xmath8 ground state molecule , the spin angular momentum of the unpaired electron contributing to the magnetic moment almost cancels the orbital angular momentum contribution to the magnetic moment .",
    "this leads to a smaller g - factor in the @xmath8 state of pbf .",
    "the smaller g - factor @xcite makes it very insensitive to the background magnetic field and this leads to reduction in some systematic errors in the experimental observation of electron edm @xcite .",
    "the other molecules having small g - factor like pbf are tho , thf@xmath10 , hfh@xmath10 , pth@xmath10 , wc , et cetera but that is in their metastable @xmath9 state . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath8 state of pbf is a ground state , which is easy to synthesize experimentally as compared to the metastable states .",
    "the energy shifts of the levels of opposite parity in the ground rotational state of @xmath1pbf due to the @xmath6 doubling is canceled by the magnetic hyperfine interaction as a repercussion the gap between two opposite parity levels is very small ( almost degenerate ) @xcite .",
    "therefore , the molecule can be polarized very easily with the application of a weak electric field and opposite sign of the @xmath6 doublet component leads to the cancellation of some systematic error",
    ". the effective electric field ( @xmath13 ) experienced by the electron in an atom or a molecule , which is equally known as p , t - odd interaction constant ( w@xmath14/@xmath15 ) is a non - measurable quantity . on the other hand",
    ", it is very important to set the upper bound limit in the search of electric dipole moment of electron .",
    "therefore , one has to rely on a very accurate theoretical method to calculate @xmath13 , precisely .",
    "the calculation of e@xmath16 of a heavy diatomic molecule is not a trivial task as it requires simultaneous inclusion of both the effect of special relativity and electron correlation due to the intertwined nature of these two effects .",
    "the relativistic coupled cluster method using four - component wavefunction meets these requirements to fulfill the purpose @xcite .",
    "there are two alternate choice to evaluate one electron response properties in the normal coupled cluster framework : ( i ) the expectation value approach and ( ii ) the derivative approach .",
    "the energy derivative approach is superior to the other one as the calculated property value is very close to the property value calculated using full configuration - interaction ( fci ) method .",
    "the z - vector method is a technique in the derivative framework , which simplifies the complexity associated with it .",
    "it calculates the energy derivate in a size extensive manner and capable of rendering accurate wave function both in the near nuclear region and apart from the nucleus and its performance has already been tested @xcite . in this article , we have chosen z - vector method in the coupled - cluster single- and double- excitation approximation ( ccsd ) for the calculation of effective electric field , @xmath13 , experienced by the unpaired electron in the ground state of pbf molecule . the parallel magnetic hyperfine structure ( hfs ) constant of @xmath1pb in pbf molecule",
    "is also calculated to judge the accuracy in the calculated @xmath13 values , since both of these properties need an accurate wavefunction in the near nuclear region .",
    "further , we have calculated molecular dipole moment of pbf molecule and both the calculated hfs constant and molecular dipole moment are compared with the experimental value and all these results are compared with the values calculated by means of other theoretical methods .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",

    "the subscript @xmath42 means only the connected terms exist in the contraction between h@xmath41 and t , which ensures the size - extensivity .",
    "as , the normal coupled cluster ( ncc ) is not a variational method , the energy is not optimized with respect to the determinantal coefficients in the expansion of the many electron correlated wavefunction and the molecular orbital ( mo ) coefficients for a fixed nuclear geometry .",

    "if we include more electrons in correlation calculation ( for tz , from a to b and for qz , from c to e ) , the @xmath59% decreases as the more number of correlated electrons includes more orthogonal space to dirac - hartree - fock space and thus includes more correlation contribution to the property value .",
    "it is also interesting to see that in tz basis , when we go from a to b , the addition of 18 electrons ( i.e. , 4s+3d+4p core electrons of pb ) improves the parallel magnetic hfs constant by 97 mhz . in qz basis , as we go from c to d and d to e , the addition of 18 electrons ( i.e. , 4s+3d+4p and 1s-3p core electrons of pb , respectively ) improves the a@xmath58 value by 75 mhz and 78 mhz , respectively . from this observation",
