    "in the present absence of a sensitive 21 cm signal from reionization , investigating the redshift evolution of the `` ly@xmath2 fraction '' , the fraction of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) which exhibit strong ly@xmath2 emission , has served as a valuable and feasible means of providing constraints on the ionization state of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "spectrosopic follow - up of lbgs has revealed that the ly@xmath2 fraction ( typically defined as lbgs with rest - frame ly@xmath2 ew @xmath13  ) steadily increases from @xmath14 to @xmath15 , reaching @xmath1650% for faint galaxies ( @xmath17 ) at @xmath18 @xcite . at higher redshifts of @xmath19 , however , initial expectations and attempts based on an extrapolation of the trend of the increasing ly@xmath2 fraction seen at lower redshifts found a reverse of the trend , showing only 20%30% of faint galaxies with ly@xmath2 emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "this steep decrease beyond @xmath18 is in line with measurements of gunn  peterson troughs @xcite in the spectra of distant quasars @xcite , which signal the ( near ) completion of reionization by @xmath18 .",
    "several attempts have been made to interpret the observed drop in the ly@xmath2 fraction in connection with the neutral fraction of the igm or different models of reionization .",
    "earlier works suggested , assuming that the observed drop in the ly@xmath2 fraction from @xmath18 to @xmath19 is entirely driven by the change in the igm transmission , that it requires a steep increase in the volume - averaged neutral fraction of @xmath20 0.40.5 over @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "alternatives have subsequently been proposed that account for the possibility of other sources of ly@xmath2 attenuation which alleviate the amount of the required increase in the neutral fraction .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that the change in the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies such as an increase in the escape fraction of ionizing photons can explain the observed drop with a mild increase in the neutral fraction of @xmath22 0.10.2 , and @xcite argued that the rise of the neutral fraction of only @xmath22 0.1 by @xmath23 is sufficient when accounting for self - shielding absorption systems ( lyman limit systems ; llss ) in the igm , which are expected to be abundant near the end of reionization ( though see @xcite ) . at @xmath19 , a sufficient sample has been assembled to start discerning between ` patchy ' and ` smooth ' models of ly@xmath2 attenuation .",
    "@xcite found from a compilation of observations at @xmath19 that the ` patchy ' model of ly@xmath2 attenuation ( which does not necessarily literally mean a patchy reionization process but may instead signal the abundant llss ; @xcite ) , is favored over the ` smooth ' attenuation model .",
    "although the interpretation is not straightforward , these studies all highlight the potential of studying the ly@xmath2 fraction as a valuable probe of reionization .",

    "normally , we expect an asymmetric line profile with a sharp blue edge and gradually declining red tail for ly@xmath2 emission at high redshift due to absorption by neutral hydrogen in the interstellar and intergalactic medium .",
    "however , most of the proposed ly@xmath2 detections in other @xmath0 candidates have not shown highly significant evidence for asymmetry , possibly due to the low s / n for most of the detections .",
    "we find that our detected line displays an asymmetric line profile , making this object one of the first notable detections of asymmetry for a @xmath39 ly@xmath2 line candidate .",
    "however , the significance is not strong due to the low s / n : the gaussian line width on the blue and red side of the line is @xmath84   and @xmath86  , respectively . due to the vicinity of a sky line located blueward of the line , the uncertainty in the line width on the blue side of the line ( @xmath83 ) is large , yielding a weak constraint on the ratio between the line width on the red and blue side ( @xmath107 ) .",

    "figure [ fig : sed ] shows the model fit and stamp images .",
    "the results of our sed fitting analysis show that the high-@xmath3 solution is preferred over the low-@xmath3 solution , albeit mildly . for the high - z interpretation , because we did not fit bands shortwards of the ly@xmath2 line due to the large uncertainty in modeling the igm attenuation , and because the source is highly contaminated by a nearby bright source in irac channels , only four bands ( _ y@xmath55 , j@xmath56 , h@xmath58 _ , and @xmath124 ) were used to constrain the fit , which can be perfectly matched by sps models with a certain combination of free parameters and nebular emission strengths , yielding @xmath127 .    for the low-@xmath3 interpretation , the non - detection in the deep optical bands detection in @xmath128 band .",
    "however , the @xmath129-band stamp image shows that all identifiable emissions are off - center and do not line up with near - infrared emission , indicating that they are likely background noise or from another unresolved faint source . using a smaller , circular 04 diameter aperture centered on the near - infrared emission",

    "the comparison quantified using a kolmogorov ",
    "smirnov test @xcite indicates that the likelihood that the normalized residuals come from the normal distribution is less than 20% , implying that the low-@xmath3 solution is not a preferred model for this galaxy .",

    "the measured stack flux is @xmath136 lower than the prediction from the low-@xmath3 solution , further indicating the preference for the high-@xmath3 interpretation of the source .",
    "we conclude that the detected line is ly@xmath2 .",
    "z7_gsd_3811 is a galaxy bright in the uv with the rest - frame uv absolute magnitude of @xmath6 , about two times brighter in luminosity than the characteristic uv magnitude of the rest - frame uv luminosity function at @xmath137 of @xmath138 @xcite .",
    "other physical properties inferred from our sed fitting analysis indicate that z7_gsd_3811 is a typical galaxy at @xmath11 78 _ for its uv magnitude _",
    ", with a moderately blue uv slope ( @xmath139 ) , dust - corrected uv - based star formation rate ( sfr ) of @xmath100 @xmath48 yr@xmath42 , and stellar mass of @xmath140/@xmath48)@xmath141 .",
    "this galaxy was noted as a promising @xmath142 candidate by several other previous _ hst _ imaging studies as well @xcite .",

    "even with our deep integration of 10 hr , we detected only one ly@xmath2 emission line with a moderate rest - frame ly@xmath2 ew of 16  . to put this result in context , we computed the number of detections expected from our observations , with the aim of placing constraints on the evolution of the ly@xmath2 visibility with redshift .",
    "first , we quantified the limiting sensitivity of our observations by simulating ly@xmath2 lines in our mosfire spectra .",
    "we modeled the ly@xmath2 line as an asymmetric gaussian , similar to the detected line in z7_gsd_3811 .",
    "then , we inserted the lines with varying line fluxes into each of the actual 1d spectra in our mask at varying positions between the mosfire @xmath61-band wavelength coverage ( 980011200  ) , to find the line flux as a function of wavelength that ensures an @xmath143-@xmath1 detection ( @xmath144 ) .",
    "the upper left panel of figure [ fig : simul ] presents the results , showing that our deep spectroscopy reaches a median 5@xmath1 limiting sensitivity in line flux of @xmath165 @xmath110 erg s@xmath42 @xmath43 between sky lines . scaling our limiting sensitivity by @xmath145 , where @xmath146 is the integration time",
    ", we find it consistent with the quoted limits of other mosfire @xmath61-band observations reported by @xcite .    for each object in our mask",
    ", we computed the @xmath143-@xmath1 limit in the rest - frame ew(ly@xmath2 ) as a function of redshift ( i.e. , observed wavelength ) for our observations .",
    "this was done via 1000 monte carlo realizations of the photometry for each object , for which we performed sed fitting . in each realization , the redshift was randomly drawn from the @xmath60 distribution ( thus the contaminant fraction , which is given by our @xmath60 , is accounted for in our results ) , and the corresponding continuum flux density redward of the ly@xmath2 was calculated from the best - fit sps model .",
    "the ratio of the limiting sensitivity , for which we take the median value at each wavelength as all the targets were observed in the same conditions in one mosfire mask , to the continuum flux density in each realization gives the rest - frame @xmath143-@xmath1 ew limit as a function of redshift ( bottom left panel of figure [ fig : simul ] ) .    by assuming an intrinsic rest - frame ew distribution for ly@xmath2 before being processed by the neutral gas in the igm , we can compute how many sources are expected to be detected above our @xmath143-@xmath1 ew limit .",
    "for the intrinsic rest - frame ew distribution for ly@xmath2 , @xmath147(ew@xmath148 , we adopted a log - normal form given by @xcite , which is based on the compilation of observations at @xmath10 when the universe is ionized .",
    "then , @xmath147(ew@xmath148 and our @xmath143-@xmath1 ew limit inferred from our fake source simulation at the corresponding wavelength is compared , to estimate the probability that the line is detected . here",
    ", we assumed that the @xmath147(ew@xmath148 does not evolve as a function of redshift from @xmath10 to @xmath11 78 .",
    "our analysis takes into account the effect of a sensitive wavelength dependancy due to sky lines and the incomplete spectral coverage of the redshift probability distribution ( @xmath60 ) , and is properly weighted by @xmath60 .",
    "the resulting probability distribution of the expected number of detections from our observations is shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : simul ] .",
    "depending on the detection threshold adopted , our results show a 12@xmath1 deviation from the null hypothesis of no evolution .",
    "for example , based on the ly@xmath2 ew distribution at lower redshift of @xmath9 36 ( assuming no evolution with redshift ) , we expect to detect @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) objects with @xmath151 ( @xmath152 ) significance , for which our observations weakly reject at the 1.3@xmath1 ( 2@xmath1 ) confidence level .",
    "our results are conservative in the sense that had we assumed a zero low-@xmath3 interloper fraction or used an extrapolation of the ew(ly@xmath2 ) distribution from lower redshifts to @xmath153 78 , the inferred deviation from the expectation ( and thus the implied decline in the ly@xmath2 fraction ) would be higher .",
    "fraction '' , z7_gsd_3811 is not regarded as a ly@xmath2-emitting galaxy , as the rest - frame ew is below the cutoff of 25 or 55  .",
    "thus , the inferred ly@xmath2 fraction from our observation at @xmath154 with ew @xmath112 25 or 55   is @xmath155 for the uv - bright galaxies ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath157 for uv - faint galaxies ( @xmath158 ; @xmath159 ) . ]",
    "we have presented results from deep near - infrared @xmath61-band spectroscopy targeting 12 galaxy candidates with @xmath64 78 in the goods - s field .",
    "our long integration of @xmath1610 hr with keck / mosfire enabled us to probe the ly@xmath2 emission down to a median 5@xmath1 rest - frame ew(ly@xmath2 ) limit of 28   ( ranging [ 1255 ]  ; listed in table [ tab : target ] ) .",
    "despite our deep spectroscopy , out of our 30 targets , we identified only one emission line at 6.5@xmath1 significance .",
    "we claim that the detection is real , given that @xmath160 ) it was detected independently on more than one night , @xmath161 ) at the expected spatial location , and @xmath162 ) with two negative peaks at the positions expected from our dithering pattern .",
    "this line is likely ly@xmath2 emission from a galaxy at @xmath163 , based on @xmath160 ) its asymmetric line profile characteristic of ly@xmath2 at high redshift , @xmath161 ) the non - detection in the optical bands as well as an optical stack ( _ v@xmath50_+_i@xmath51_+_i@xmath52_+_z@xmath53 _ bands ) , and @xmath162 ) the inferred redshift in good agreement with its photometric redshift .",
    "while we can not completely rule out the possibility that the detected line is an unresolved [ oii ]  doublet from a galaxy at @xmath114 , we find that it is unlikely , as a serendipitious [ oii ]  emitter at @xmath164 that falls in one of the slits , with the redshift difference of only @xmath165 and with a similar s / n to that of z7_gsd_3811 , shows clearly resolved double peaks both in our final stack and on individual nights . however , although rare , it is still feasible that the detected line is one of the two peaks of a broad [ oii ]  doublet indicative of an agn or strong outflows .",
    "the detected ly@xmath2 line has a modest rest - frame ew of 16   and a line flux of @xmath166 erg s@xmath42 @xmath43 .",
    "this galaxy is bright in the uv ( @xmath167 ; @xmath168 ) , and is a typical for its uv brightness in terms of uv slope ( @xmath169 ) and stellar mass ( @xmath170 ) .    identifying its nature via follow - up observations would be challenging but not impossible . assuming this galaxy is an [ oii ]  emitter at @xmath114 , other strong rest - frame optical emission lines ( h@xmath92 , [ oiii ] , and h@xmath2 ) all fall in between ground - based near - infrared bands",
    ", thus deep spaced - based grism may be the only possibility to detect those lines before the advent of the _ james webb space telescope_. if this galaxy is indeed at @xmath163 ( with a normal stellar population ) , other emission features ( e.g. , ciii]@xmath1131907 , 1909 ) would be too weak to be detected in currently available data sets ( e.g. , _ hst _ grism ) based on the typical flux ratio , unless ly@xmath2 is attenuated more than a factor of 15 by the igm .",
    "however , this is unlikely given the ly@xmath2 ew distribution found by @xcite and @xcite for its uv luminosity in galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "additional integration in @xmath61-band ( for ly@xmath2 ) or deep @xmath171-band observations ( for ciii ] ) can help verifying its identity .",
    "alternatively , the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) provides an opportunity to detect the [ cii ]  line at 158 @xmath125 m with less than an hour of integration , assuming that the empirical relation between sfr and [ cii ]  158 @xmath125 m luminosity found for normal star - forming galaxies at high redshift @xcite holds .",
    "the rest of the targeted galaxies remain undetected , showing a @xmath172 ( @xmath173 ) deviation from the expected number of detections ( with @xmath1125@xmath1 ( @xmath1123@xmath1 ) significance ) when assuming no evolution in the ly@xmath2 ew distribution from lower redshifts of @xmath10 to @xmath11 78 .",
    "our observations thus support the decline in the ew of ly@xmath2 at @xmath12 of earlier studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may be due to the increase of neutral gas in the igm . however , the evidence from our observations alone is not conclusive due to the large statistical uncertainties .",
    "the addition of our sample to the compilation of previous data would be only incremental , thus we defer a detailed analysis on the evolution of the igm neutrality to future studies with a larger statistical sample .    however , our results from very deep spectroscopy have implications for future observations . recently ,",
    "several studies @xcite have claimed a high ly@xmath2 visibility in bright galaxies at @xmath5 in the egs field , which were selected based on red irac [ 3.6]@xmath24[4.5 ] colors indicative of strong [ oiii ]  emission .",
    "combined with the recent discovery of lyman continuum leakers among strong [ oiii ]  emitters at low redshifts @xcite and the lack of significant ly@xmath2 detections in the goods - s field at comparable redshifts ( before this study ) , this may signal the inhomogeneity of the reionization process on large scales . indeed , while laes at lower redshifts of @xmath10 show that faint laes on average have a larger ly@xmath2 ew than bright ones @xcite , most spectrosopic campaigns at higher redshift targeting @xmath39 galaxy candidates have only succeeded in detecting ly@xmath2 emission in bright galaxies @xcite .",
    "our results are in line with these studies , yielding one ly@xmath2 detection from a bright ( @xmath174 ) galaxy .",
    "however , it is noteworthy that our sole detection in z7_gsd_3811 is among those with the lowest ew limit ( cyan circles in the bottom left panel of figure [ fig : simul ] ) .",
    "this indicates that current spectroscopic campaigns at @xmath39 are only reaching a sufficient depth for the brightest galaxies , leaving the possibility of detecting several galaxies in ly@xmath2 emission with modest ly@xmath2 ew in fainter galaxies open with deeper spectroscopy .",
    "extremely deep spectroscopy ( either by performing long integrations on blank fields or by utilizing magnification due to gravitational lensing ) to better quantify the ly@xmath2 ew distribution , along with quantifying large - scale spatial fluctuation in the reionization process from spatial clustering of ly@xmath2 emission from wide area surveys , will remain as a valuable probe of reionization in the near future .",
