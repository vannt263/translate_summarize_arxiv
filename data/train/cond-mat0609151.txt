    "organic conductors have been of considerable interest because of their characteristic properties in low - dimensional electronic system.@xcite the quasi - two dimensional ( 2d ) triclinic ( space group p@xmath20 ) salt , @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 , where bets is bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene ( c@xmath21s@xmath10se@xmath10h@xmath22 ) , has been one of the most attractive materials among various organic conductors.@xcite below a magnetic field ( @xmath23 ) of about 14 t , as the temperature ( @xmath6 ) is lowered , it has a transition from a paramagnetic metal ( pm ) to an antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) phase , and at higher fields and low @xmath6 there is a pm to a field - induced superconducting ( fisc ) phase.@xcite although it has been suggested@xcite that the fisc phase can be explained by the jaccarino - peter compensation effect,@xcite one problem with this interpretation is that the fisc state in @xmath24-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 could be destroyed by a very small amount of out - of - plane magnetic field.@xcite    an important aspect of the pm to afi transition in @xmath24-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 , which is one of the main topics of this paper , is that the metal - insulator ( m - i ) transition and that of the paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic order occur at the same @xmath6 , i.e. , @xmath25 = @xmath26 , ( @xmath25 is the n@xmath27el temperature and @xmath26 is the m - i transition ) .",
    "this coordination of properties is confirmed by electrical resistivity , heat capacity , and magnetic susceptibility measurements where a high spin @xmath14 = 5/2 state for the fe@xmath13 is observed.@xcite it has been stated that in this material the af ordering of the fe@xmath13 ion spins is mediated by the @xmath28-electrons , while the direct magnetic dipole - dipole interaction between the fe@xmath13 @xmath7 fe@xmath13 spins is negligible because the neighboring fe@xmath13 are more than @xmath12 6 @xmath29 apart.@xcite it should be noted that the phase diagram of the iso - structural nonmagnetic and non-3@xmath30-electron analog @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9gacl@xmath10 is completely different from that of @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10.@xcite so far , the role of the @xmath31-d interaction for the pm - afi phase transition has not been investigated with direct experimental evidence .    in this paper , we report proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( @xmath0h - nmr ) spin - echo measurements in an applied magnetic field @xmath32 = 9 t aligned along the @xmath5-axis for 2.0 k @xmath33 @xmath34 180 k on a single crystal of the organic conductor @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 .",

    "one important result of this investigation is that @xmath1 has large , slow beats that are explained by the proton@xmath7proton dipole interaction .",

    "an important property of @xmath65(2@xmath36 ) is that its shape depends on both @xmath6 and which spectral peak is measured .",
    "the main features of @xmath65(2@xmath36 ) are : ( 1 ) an overall exponential decay rate 1/@xmath2 and ( 2 ) for some of the spectral lines a slow oscillation with the beat frequency @xmath58 .",

    "an interpretation of this effect is given in section iv .",

    "two important features seen in figs .",
    "2@xmath75 are that the shape of @xmath1 depends on both @xmath6 and the peak number .    an alternative way to obtain @xmath58 is to apply the fast fourier transform ( fft ) algorithm to @xmath65(2@xmath73 .",
    "this was done by mirroring @xmath65(2@xmath73 into the @xmath74 domain , using a cubic spline interpolation to obtain equally spaced linear time intervals , and applying the fft algorithm to this array .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "6 , where the normalized fft of the amplitude of the spin - echo decay is plotted as a function of frequency @xmath75 .    there",

    "higher @xmath6 , these peaks are smeared out by the progressively wider distribution , which corresponds to the shortening of @xmath2 . even with this smearing , it is seen in fig .",
    "5 that the beats persist to relatively high @xmath6 .",
    "an important property of @xmath58 is that it does not change across the pm - afi phase transition .",
    "this behavior implies that the internal source that generates the beats is independent of this phase transition .",
    "the slow beat fit parameters @xmath11 and @xmath71 for the spectral peak 4 , obtained using eq .",
    "( 1 ) , are shown as a function of @xmath6 in fig .",
    "our best estimate of the uncertainty in the parameters is approximately the size of the symbols below 10 k and the error bars at higher @xmath6 .",
    "figure 7 shows in more detail than fig . 6",
    "that @xmath11 = ( 7.0 @xmath41 0.3 ) khz below 18 k and that there is no obvious change in @xmath11 across the pm - afi phase transition .    on the other hand @xmath71",
    "does increase from @xmath71 = 0.40 @xmath41 0.05 at 4 k to 0.73 @xmath41 0.02 at 2 k when @xmath6 is lowered through the pm - afi transition . also , above @xmath12 18 k both @xmath11 and @xmath71 increase slightly with temperature .",
    "it is noticeable that the temperature at the minimum of @xmath37 ( fig .",
    "1 ) also matches these features for the slow beat fit parameters .",
    "although their physical origins are not fully understood , an interpretation of these features is presented in sec .",
    "iv a.      the upper curve in fig .",

    "later are the @xmath0h - nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath16 ( lower curve ) and 1/@xmath16 @xmath7 1/@xmath2 ( middle curve ) vs @xmath6 at the same field and orientation for the same @xmath8-(bets)@xmath60fecl@xmath10 sample .",
    "measurements using increasing and decreasing values of @xmath6 do not show hysteresis in 1/@xmath2 at @xmath26 = 3.5 k. the mechanisms for these properties of 1/@xmath2 are discussed in sec .",
    "the main challenge here is to identify and apply the various interactions responsible for the details of the measured @xmath1 .",
    "usually , the main considerations for @xmath1 are the dipolar interactions among identical and different nuclei , the static and fluctuating magnetic fields from nearby electron moments , and 1/@xmath16 of the nuclei under study.@xcite another important point is whether the nmr spectrum is strongly inhomogeneously broadened on a microscopic distance scale , which can cause many of the spins of one nuclear species act as `` inequivalent '' , or `` detuned '' spins.@xcite the latter case applies to our work , where the @xmath12 8 mhz width of @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "3 ) from the fe@xmath13 moment is very large in comparison to the homogeneous line width 1/(@xmath79 ) @xmath12 5 khz ( fig .",
    "an important question is : what is the physical origin of the slow beats observed in @xmath1 ?",
    "since the static field from the fe@xmath13 moments provides the large splitting that detunes the protons , it is not possible for this field to directly generate the small value obtined for @xmath58 .",
    "there can be an indirect effect because it determines @xmath69 for the each proton site , and therefore to which spectral peak it contributes .",
    "also , since the correlation time of the fe@xmath13 moments is expected to be very short because of their large interactions,@xcite their fluctuations are not expected to determine @xmath58 .",
    "a promising mechanism to produce the slow beats in @xmath1 is the dipole - dipole interaction between the nuclei in the presence of strong inhomogeneous broadening , as reported by ansermet et al @xcite in their work on a co layer chemisorbed on pt particles .",
    "below , their model is adapted to the conditions of our measurements .",
    "in addition to the inhomogeneous broadening , these conditions are : ( 1 ) every proton site ( @xmath80 ) is occupied and ( 2 ) each site has one nearest neighbor from the same ch@xmath9 unit ( @xmath81 = 1 ) , two other near neighbors from the adjacent ch@xmath9 group ( @xmath81 = 2 , 3 ) at the same end of the bets molecule , and many more distant neighbors from other ch@xmath9 units ( @xmath81 @xmath82 3).@xcite    because the inhomogeneous broadening detunes the spins at the fifteen other sites in a unit cell , the probability of mutual spin flips is greatly reduced for calculating @xmath58 for a given @xmath80 .",
    "thus , it will be assumed that all proton pairs are detuned .",
    "the hamiltonian ( @xmath83 ) which produces a frequency contribution ( @xmath84 ) to the slow beat frequency ( @xmath85 ) from the dipolar coupling between two detuned protons , using the quantization direction @xmath86 , is then @xcite @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the vector connecting sites @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath89 is the angle between @xmath90 and @xmath32 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the @xmath93-components of the nuclear spin operators ( @xmath94 ) , and @xmath95 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nuclei ( for protons , @xmath91 , @xmath92 = @xmath41 1/2 ) . for proton @xmath80 , the dipole frequency contribution from proton @xmath81",
    "is @xmath96 and the total echo amplitude [ @xmath97 associated with this term for spin @xmath80 is @xcite @xmath98 this approximation is used for the summation because the near neighbor spins ( @xmath81 @xmath99 4 ) have a large number of small terms with alternating signs resulting a negligible effect on @xmath100 .",
    "the term @xmath101 can have both large and small values , depending on which proton site it represents .",
    "the reason for this is that the different values of @xmath89 for the different nearest neighbor protons can give both larger and smaller values of @xmath101 ( figs . 2 and 4 ) .",
    "a simple way to handle this situation is to interpret @xmath71 as the fraction of nuclei in the echo for which @xmath102 0 and the term 1 @xmath7 @xmath71 as the fraction for the rest with the evolved phase @xmath103 .",
    "this then gives the ensemble average contribution ( @xmath104 ) @xmath105\\ ] ] to @xmath1 .",
    "in addition to these terms , there is a multiplicatve factor @xmath106 .",
    "when these items are combined , one obtains eq .",
    "( 1 ) , which provides an excellent fit to the data ( figs . 2 and 5 ) .",
    "it turns out that a resonably good fit to the echo modulation of peak 4 at 3.2 k can be obtained using the above model and the proton - proton dipolar coupling of site h14 with its three nearest neighbors .",
    "two of the justifications for this approach are : ( 1 ) as seen in the bottom of fig .",
    "3 , it is reasonable to consider that proton sites 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 can contribute to the signal in peak 4 , and ( 2 ) because the frequency range used for the echo has been narrowed to @xmath41 60 khz , which is smaller than the typical calculated shift between these sites , it is expected that a single proton site will dominate the echo signal obtained from the measurements .",
    "when one calculates the 8 values of @xmath58 associated with the up / down alignment of the 3 nearest neighbors ( not shown in detail here ) for proton sites 1 , 3 , 7 , and 14 , it turns out that the best fit to the data comes from the proton site 14 , whose values for @xmath58 are @xmath41 1.02 khz , @xmath41 1.57 khz , @xmath41 9.39 khz , and @xmath41 9.94 khz , all of which are much smaller than the shifts from the dipolar field of the fe@xmath13 .",
    "a comparison of this model to the observed echo decay at 3.2 k in the frequency domain for the peak 4 is shown in fig .",
    "9 . there , normalized fft of the measured ( solid line ) and model ( dashed line ) @xmath1 at 3.2 k are plotted as a function of the frequency @xmath75 for @xmath32 = 9 t @xmath38 @xmath5 . for this model , the value 1/@xmath2 = 2.4@xmath42 10@xmath107 s@xmath78 has been chosen to provide the best fit to the data .",
    "several features of our measurements can be discussed in terms of this kind of model .",
    "one is that there is a large variation of @xmath58 across the spectrum ( figs . 2 and 4 ) .",
    "it is attributed to variations in @xmath84 ( mainly from variations in @xmath89 ) for the different proton sites .",
    "another is the variation in @xmath71 as the pm - afi boundary is traversed ( fig .",
    "one possible mechanism for that ( and the change in 1/@xmath2 , fig .",
    "8) is that because of the change in the fe@xmath13 polarization across the pm - afi phase transition , the contributions of the proton sites responsible for the peak 4 are changed .",
    "because of the complexity of the mechanisms for 1/@xmath2 , it is difficult to give a precise interpretation of the results . in general , the mechanisms that may contribute to the value of 1/@xmath2 obtained from the fits to the data are the proton - proton dipolar interactions in a strongly inhomogeneously broadened spectrum , the proton spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/@xmath16 ( from the power spectrum of the transverse magnetic field fluctuations of the fe@xmath13 moments at @xmath50 ) , and the magnetic field fluctuations from the fe@xmath13 moments parallel to @xmath23 on the time scale of @xmath2 . because of the relatively large spin - spin interactions among the fe@xmath13 moments , which correspond to a fluctuation correlation time @xmath108 @xmath12 3 @xmath42 10@xmath109 s from the dipole - dipole interaction ( @xmath12 20 g ) and @xmath108 @xmath12 5 @xmath42 10@xmath110 s from the total exchange interaction ( @xmath12 1.7 k),@xcite it is expected that the field fluctuations from the fe@xmath13 moments parallel to @xmath23 will not contribute significantly to @xmath39 .",
    "figure 10 shows the large variation of 1/@xmath2 , along with the values of @xmath58 , and 10@xmath111 , plotted as a function of the frequency shift ( @xmath112 ) from the center of the peak 4 at 5.2 k with @xmath32 = 9 t @xmath76 .",
    "these data were obtained by averaging 10 @xmath7 15 points ( bandwidth = 122 @xmath7 183 khz ) of the fft of the spin echo signals for each @xmath112 by fits using eq .",
    "the bandwidth of 122 khz is shown as the typical measured width at the bottom and the vertical error bars are the variance obtained from the fit .",
    "figure 10 indicates that as @xmath112 is varied from left to right , @xmath58 increases by about 12 @xmath19 , @xmath72 increases by about 33 @xmath19 and 1/@xmath2 increases by a factor of 2.17 .",
    "the latter is about 7.5 times larger than the reduction in 1/@xmath2 at the pm - afi phase boundary ( fig . 8) .",
    "there are at least two kinds of contributions to 1/@xmath2 from the proton dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "one is a dynamic interaction from the mutual spin flips between protons that are not detuned . because of the large inhomogeneous broadening throughout the sample , it is expected that only the protons at the same site , which have the same local field , can participate in this process .",
    "this contribution is examined in more detail below .",
    "the other contribution is static .",
    "it comes from the variations in @xmath100 for a given site .",
    "that leads to a distribution of frequencies in the time domain that corresponds to a broadening of the fft in the frequency domain .",
    "it can include peaks at @xmath58 = 0 and finite @xmath58 whose width corresponds to the value of 1/@xmath2 obtained from the fit of the experimental data with eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 5 ) .    from fig .",
    "8 , it is seen that in the pm phase up to 30 k , 1/@xmath2 @xmath7 1/@xmath16 is constant . at higher",
    "@xmath6 it is constant , but with a large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , we assume that in the pm phase @xmath113 where the constant @xmath114 @xmath12 2.3 @xmath42 10@xmath107 s@xmath78 . in the afi phase ,",
    "the same relation applies , but with @xmath114 @xmath12 1.6 @xmath42 10@xmath107 s@xmath78 . in many cases , eq .",
    "( 6 ) is a valid representation of experimental results .",
    "@xcite    following the discussion above , it is assumed that @xmath114 = @xmath115 + @xmath116 , where @xmath115 is the static contribution from the detuned protons [ eq .",
    "( 2 ) ] and @xmath116 is from the mutual spin flips of protons at the same site on different molecules that remain tuned in the pm phase . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian ( @xmath117 ) is @xcite @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the raising and lowering operators .    a calculation of eq .",
    "( 7 ) for one site h14 proton with its five nearest neighbors ( details not shown ) provides a direct contribution of @xmath12 0.7 @xmath42 10@xmath77 s@xmath78 to @xmath116 , which is very small compared to the measured value @xmath12 2.3 @xmath42 10@xmath107 s@xmath78 .",
    "however , it is also expected that there is an indirect dynamic contribution to @xmath116 that comes from the mutual spin flips of the near neighbors of a given site , which will also increase its echo decay rate .",
    "this contribution is difficult to calculate and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , @xmath12 0.7 @xmath42 10@xmath77 s@xmath78 is a lower limit for the value of @xmath116 for site h14 , and the actual value could be substantially larger . under these circumstances , it is straightforward to obtain @xmath114 from the experimental results , but it is difficult to separate it into @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "the next point is how to interpret the discontinuity in @xmath114 for the peak 4 at the pm - afi transition , where it drops by @xmath121 @xmath12 7.0 @xmath42 10@xmath107 s@xmath78 ( @xmath12 34 @xmath19 ) .",
    "it is expected that the overall mechanism for @xmath122 @xmath123 is related to the small reorientation of the fe@xmath13 moments that occurs at the transition , but whose details are not presently known . even though this reorientation should be small because the zeeman splitting ( @xmath12 12.1 k at 9 t ) is large compared to @xmath26 and the total interaction between the fe@xmath13 moments ( @xmath12 1 k),@xcite it could still have a significant effect through changing the local field at each of the proton sites .    under these circumstances ,",
    "one possible mechanism is that at the transition the spatial period for the dipole field of the fe@xmath13 moments is increased , thereby reducing the density of tuned spins and reducing @xmath116 .",
    "another possibility follows from the variation of @xmath39 across the peak 4 ( fig .",
    "it is expected that such a change in the fe@xmath13 dipole field will change the distribution of sites that contribute to the part of the peak 4 at which the measurement was made .",
    "since the change of @xmath39 across the peak 4 is more than a factor of two , the @xmath12 34 @xmath19 drop in @xmath39 should correspond to a relatively small redistribution of source sites and could be the main mechanism for @xmath121 .",
    "although these mechanisms are possible ones , they can not be verified within the framework of the present results .",
    "it is also possible that a different mechanism is responsible for @xmath121 .",
    "in summary , from the measurements of 1/@xmath2 over all @xmath6 , it is seen that the proton - proton dipole interactions dominate 1/@xmath2 in @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 below 20 k. at higher @xmath6 , there is a significant contribution from @xmath40 and it is likely that the proton dipolar part is independent of @xmath6 throughout the pm phase .",
    "there are also large variations in 1/@xmath2 as a function of the spectral peak ( fig .",
    "4 ) and across the peak 4 ( fig .",
    "10 ) . at the pm - afi transition ,",
    "measurements on the center of the peak 4 show a @xmath12 34 @xmath19 drop in 1/@xmath2 .",
    "two possible main mechanisms for this drop are : ( 1 ) that the small change in the local field from the reorientation of the fe@xmath13 reduces the number of protons that can undergo mutual spin flips , and ( 2 ) that the proton sites responsible for the center of the peak 4 are changed by the change in the local field . the discontinuity in 1/@xmath2 and",
    "the lack of thermal hysteresis in its change at 3.5 k is evidence that the pm - afi transition is weakly first order .",
    "nmr measurements of the proton spin echo decay in a small ( @xmath12 4 @xmath43@xmath124 ) single crystal of the organic conductor @xmath8-(bets)@xmath9fecl@xmath10 are reported for @xmath23 = 9 t along the @xmath5 axis over the range 2.0 k @xmath33 @xmath34 180 k. also , the electrical resistivity as a function of @xmath6 at several values of @xmath125 @xmath5 on the same sample is reported .",
    "the form of the echo decay is analyzed using a simple model to obtain 1/@xmath2 and @xmath58 for the nmr spectrum peak 4 as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "it is found that below @xmath126 k , where it can be well identified , @xmath58 @xmath12 7 khz independent of @xmath6 . its origin is from the dipole - dipole interaction among the protons , which are strongly detuned by the large , inhomogeneous local magnetic field from the fe@xmath13 moments .",
    "it is also found that there is a large variation in 1/@xmath2 for the six different spectral peaks and a large variation across the peak 4 .    in the pm phase , the results for 1/@xmath2 show a temperature independent part that is attributed to the dipole - dipole interaction of both tuned and detuned proton pairs and a @xmath6-dependent part from 1/@xmath16 .    on going from the pm to afi phase at 3.5 k",
    ", there is a discontinuous 34@xmath19 drop in 1/@xmath2 that is evidence that the transition is first order , in agreement with prior work .",
    "@xcite two possible mechanisms for this drop are presented .",
    "one involves the reduction of proton pairs that conserve energy in mutual spin flips because of the additional field inhomogeneity caused by the fe@xmath13 realignment at the transition .",
    "the other is related to a change in the proton sites that contribute to the echo of the peak 4 caused by the shift in local field at the transition .",
