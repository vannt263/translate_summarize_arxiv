    "it has been known for many years that the effective lagrangian of pions and and @xmath2 mesons accounts for the correct @xmath7 coupling @xcite , and guarantees unitarity of @xmath11 scattering for energies below @xmath12 . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that a proper description of @xmath11 scattering beyond @xmath12 requires introducing the scalar singlet @xmath1 , with a mass around 500 mev . recently , seeking for similarities between the @xmath1 meson and the 125 gev resonance observed at the lhc , it has been pointed out that the @xmath13 coupling , in units of the pion decay constant , is equal to unity with remarkable accuracy @xcite . in general",
    ", the physics of @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be described in terms of a linear representation of the chiral group , with the @xmath14 isospin triplet and the @xmath1 singlet forming a bi - doublet of @xmath15 .",
    "in fact the vertices with multiple @xmath0 and @xmath1 legs can be made independent of each other by taking an arbitrarily large number of higher dimensional chiral invariants in the effective lagrangian .",
    "however the experimental result @xmath16 suggests that the higher dimensional operators are suppressed , and the linearly - realized effective lagrangian of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions is approximately invariant under classical scale invariance ( csi ) , the latter being only broken by a dimension - two mass term . in other words ,",
    "experimental data suggest that the ordinary linear sigma model ( lsm ) is a good description of @xmath0 and @xmath1 interactions .",
    "one could think of extending the particle content of the lsm to include the @xmath2 meson , and thus successfully account for the elastic @xmath11 scattering below @xmath12 with a simple linear lagrangian .",
    "this , however , does not work as smoothly as one could hope .",
    "the reason is that a linear @xmath15 lagrangian with vectors must also include the axial - vector meson @xmath3 .",
    "if the the @xmath3 mass is assumed to be infinitely large , low - energy @xmath11 data can be reproduced quite well within a linear model @xcite . however",
    ", a finite @xmath17 introduces a non - zero @xmath5 quadratic mixing term , which can only be removed by shifting the axial - vector field .",
    "this modifies the @xmath18 and @xmath13 vertices , and makes the agreement with experimental data possible but problematic : the @xmath6 coupling turns out to equal to one by accident , rather than symmetry , and the longitudinal vector meson scattering amplitudes grow like @xmath19 rather than @xmath8 .",
    "as we shall see , a possible way to protect the @xmath6 coupling from contamination by the @xmath5 mixing is to extended the ordinary custodial isospin symmetry to include a larger _ custodial chiral symmetry _ ( ccs ) , which constrains the interactions between the spin - zero and spin - one resonances @xcite .",
    "this forbids the @xmath5 mixing , and , together with csi , implies @xmath20 .",
    "unfortunately , as we shall see , ccs also implies @xmath21 , in clear contrast with experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we show that a linear model including spin - one resonances may account for the experimental data if chiral quark dynamics is added on top of the meson lagrangian .",
    "this introduces running couplings in the lagrangian of meson interactions , and allows setting the @xmath5 mixing to zero at zero momentum . with zero mixing for on - shell ( or nearly on - shell )",
    "pions , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 couplings receive no contribution from the corresponding vertices with one or both pions replaced by the axial - vector meson . as a consequence , and after imposing csi , we obtain @xmath20 , while still having @xmath22 at @xmath2 momenta greater than zero .",
    "we further require the longitudinal vector meson scattering amplitudes to grow at most like @xmath8 , which allows us to impose an additional constraint on the parameters . as a result",
    "we are able to make accurate predictions for the axial decay constant @xmath10 and the @xmath7 coupling , which turn out to be in excellent agreement with data . extrapolating these results to theories other than qcd",

    "the prediction for @xmath10 agrees with the experimental value ( [ eq : faexp ] ) at the 1@xmath1 level , whereas @xmath7 agrees with the values shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : rhopipi ] at the 2@xmath1 level . in order to obtain an even more accurate result",
    ", we should take into account , in the effective lagrangian , the pion mass and other sources of explicit chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "this , however , would force us to fit , rather than predict .",
    "alternatively , we can assume that small departures from the chiral limit , in two - flavor qcd , affect the pion mass and decay constant , but nearly leaves the other observables unaffected .",
    "in this case we can use as input the value of @xmath24 extrapolated to the chiral limit , @xmath199 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 decay constant is unaffected , whereas for @xmath7 this gives @xmath200 in excellent agreement with the experimental value .",
    "this result for @xmath7 is especially interesting , since the coupling grows from zero at zero momentum , because of the condition ( [ eq : nomix ] ) , to its correct experimental value at @xmath198 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : grpp ] .",
    "this and the result for @xmath10 suggest that the ansatz ( [ eq : nomix ] ) is a correct one .",
    "we finally notice that @xmath10 and @xmath7 are rather sensitive to @xmath140 .",
    "for instance , setting @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) leads to a central value @xmath203 mev ( @xmath204 mev ) .",
    "therefore , the @xmath205 constraint appears to be satisfied to a good degree of accuracy .",
    "this implies that the @xmath2 and @xmath3 meson behave like true gauge bosons .",
    "coupling , as given by ( [ eq : grpprunning ] ) .",
    "a zero momentum this is zero , because of the condition ( [ eq : nomix ] ) , but grows to its correct experimental value at @xmath198.,width=240 ]",
    "in a strongly - coupled theory with near - conformal dynamics , the vector and axial - vector mesons corresponding to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively , are expected to be near - degenerate : @xmath206 @xcite . from ( [ eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : a1 ] ) we obtain @xmath207 here @xmath208 , @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath211 and @xmath212 are quantities in all equivalent to their qcd counterparts , respectively @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath192 , @xmath213 , @xmath159 , and @xmath160 . the vector - axial near - degeneracy implies @xmath214 near - conformal dynamics also suggests that the @xmath170 functions run slowly . since @xmath115 is small at scales near @xmath215 , we expect it to be small for all external momenta .",
    "furthermore , we still expect @xmath116 to vanish at zero momentum , that is , for @xmath216 : as we have seen this appears to be the proper way to remove the unwanted @xmath217 mixing , where @xmath218 are the pseudoscalars equivalent to the qcd pions .",
    "near - conformal dynamics suggests that @xmath219 for all values of @xmath135 between @xmath209 and the compositeness scale . since @xmath220",
    ", we see that ccs is expected to be an approximate symmetry of strongly - coupled theories with near - conformal dynamics .",
    "this has important physical consequences .",
    "for instance , we immediately obtain that , unlike qcd , @xmath221 for the @xmath222 coupling , where @xmath223 is the scalar singlet equivalent to the @xmath1 meson , we still obtain @xmath224 as this is a consequence of csi in the meson lagrangian . in technicolor theories @xmath223 is identified with the composite higgs boson , whereas @xmath225 and @xmath226 are , respectively , the goldstone boson eaten by the longitudinal component of the @xmath227 and @xmath185 boson . equation ( [ eq : hpp ] ) suggests that the composite higgs has standard coupling to the @xmath227 and @xmath185 boson @xcite , in agreement with observation .",
    "this is particularly interesting , since near - conformal technicolor theories are expected to feature a lighter scalar singlet than qcd - like technicolor .",
    "including the large and negative radiative corrections to its mass from the top quark @xcite , such a state could be as light as the observed 125 gev resonance .",
    "if the technicolor scenario is realized in nature , ( [ eq : grppwalking ] ) tells us that the spin - one resonances might be difficult to find at the lhc , since the typically dominant di - boson decays are suppressed .",
    "in this note we have discussed the possibility that the qcd @xmath14 pseudoscalar triplet and the @xmath1 singlet form a linear bi - doublet of the chiral group @xmath15 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the @xmath6 coupling , as implicitly defined in ( [ eq : a ] ) , is , to a very good approximation , equal to one . while a lsm lagrangian with pions and @xmath1 does lead to @xmath20 ( neglecting small corrections from explicit chiral symmetry breaking )",
    ", the situation is very different when the lightest @xmath15 resonances are included .",
    "the quadratic mixing between pion and axial - vector meson requires a shift of the latter .",
    "this , in turn , introduces contamination of the @xmath13 vertex from @xmath98 and @xmath228 , and leads , in general , to @xmath229 .",
    "furthermore , agreement with data for the @xmath7 coupling requires the inclusion of @xmath230 operators other than the ones containing the kinetic terms .",
    "this spoils the special relationship between trilinear and quartic vector couplings leading to cancellation of the term growing like @xmath19 , in longitudinal vector meson scattering amplitudes , and is therefore potentially problematic for unitarity .",
    "setting the axial - pion mixing to zero does lead to @xmath20 , but also @xmath21 , in clear contrast with experimental data .",
    "the scenario changes radically when chiral quark dynamics is added on top of the meson lagrangian .",
    "working in the large-@xmath4 approximation , we have shown that fermion loops introduce momentum dependence on the couplings , and allows setting the axial - pion mixing to zero at zero momentum only . as a consequence",
    "the @xmath13 vertex receives no more contribution from @xmath98 and @xmath228 .",
    "then , allowing for classical scale invariance to be only broken by dimension - two mass terms implies @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , requiring the longitudinal vector meson scattering amplitudes to grow at most like @xmath8 leads to sensible predictions for @xmath7 and the axial - vector decay constant @xmath10 , which turn out to be in excellent agreement with experimental data .",
    "we finally argued that the vanishing of the axial - pion mixing at zero momentum suggests that meson lagrangians of strongly - coupled theories with near - conformal dynamics are expected to feature an approximate chiral custodial symmetry , in addition to the ordinary custodial isospin symmetry .",
    "this has interesting phenomenological consequences when applied to near - conformal technicolor , such as , for instance , a small coupling of the spin - one resonances to the weak bosons .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the search for spin - one resonances at the lhc might be harder than expected .",
