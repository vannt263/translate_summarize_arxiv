    "in the quasi - elastic regime ( qe ) , the doubly - differential cross section , in which a neutrino carrying initial four - momentum @xmath2 scatters off a nuclear target to a state of four - momentum @xmath3 can be written in born approximation as follows : [ elem ] = l _ w_a^  , where @xmath4 is the fermi constant and @xmath5 is the ckm matrix element coupling @xmath6 and @xmath7 quarks .",
    "the leptonic tensor is completely determined by lepton kinematics , whereas the nuclear tensor @xmath8 , containing all the information on strong interactions dynamics , describes the response of the target nucleus , @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the initial and final hadronic states carrying four momenta @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 is the nuclear electroweak current operator ; the sum includes all hadronic final states . in the impulse approximation ( ia ) scheme ,",
    "the nuclear current can be written as a sum of one - body currents , i.e. @xmath15 , while the final state reduces to the direct product of the hadronic state produced at the weak vertex ( with momentum @xmath16 ) and that describing the @xmath17-nucleon residual system , with momentum @xmath18 : @xmath19 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the final expression of the hadronic tensor can be cast in the following form : w_a^&= & d^3pde p(*p*,e ) w^(p , q )  , [ hadtensor ] where @xmath20 and the function @xmath21 is the target _ spectral function _",
    "i.e. the probability distribution of finding a nucleon with momentum @xmath22 and removal energy @xmath23 in the target nucleus .",
    "the quantity @xmath24 is the tensor describing the weak interactions of the @xmath25-th nucleon in free space ; the effect of nuclear binding of the struck nucleon is accounted for by the replacement @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the second argument in the hadronic tensor is @xmath28 .",
    "the rfg @xcite model , widely used in montecarlo simulations , provides the simplest form of the spectral function , @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the fermi momentum and @xmath31 is the average binding energy , introduced to account for nuclear binding .",
    "thus , in this model @xmath30 and @xmath31 are two parameters that are _ adjusted _ to reproduce the experimental data . for oxygen , the analysis of electron scattering data yields @xmath32 mev and @xmath33 mev .      within the relativistic mean field approximation we refer to the model described in @xcite , where , like in the previous cases , the nuclear current is written as a sum of single - nucleon currents",
    "the wave functions for the target and the residual nuclei are described in terms of an independent - particle model .",
    "then , the transition matrix elements can be cast in the following form : @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the wave functions for initial bound and final outgoing nucleons , respectively , and @xmath37 is the relativistic current operator . in particular",
    ", the relativistic bound - state wave functions ( for both initial and outgoing nucleons ) are obtained as a solution of the dirac equation , in the presence of the same relativistic nuclear mean field potential , derived from a lagrangian containing @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons .",
    "the last model we want to take into account has been introduced in @xcite , where the hadronic tensor is expressed in terms of the nuclear response functions treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "the response functions are related to the imaginary part of the corresponding full polarization propagators and the introduction of the rpa approximation means that the polarization propagators are the solutions of integral equations involving the bare propagators and the effective interaction between particle - hole excitations . within this formalism",
    ", the authors of @xcite were able to show that multinucleon terms sizably increase the genuine charged current qe cross section in such a way to reproduce the miniboone results @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the enhancement that brings the theoretical cross section into agreement with the data is multi nucleon knock out , leading to two particle - two hole ( 2p2h ) nuclear final states . in the following",
    ", we will refer to this `` generalized '' qe cross section as rpa-2p2h whereas we adopt the short rpa for the genuine qe cross section .      to summarize this section , we present in fig.[fig : xsect ] a comparison of the five total qe cross sections for the @xmath41 process ( left panel ) and @xmath42 ( right panel ) , in the energy range @xmath43 $ ] gev .",
    "the curves have been computed using the dipole structure of the form factors and , in particular , a value of the axial mass close to @xmath44 gev .",

    "the inclusion of 2p2h contributions largely enhances the qe cross section in the rpa approximation for energies above @xmath48 gev , although it is smaller than the rfg at smaller energies . for antineutrinos ( right panel )",
    "the observed pattern is almost the same .",
    "to estimate the impact of different models of the cross section on the measurement of @xmath0 and leptonic cp violation we choose a @xmath49 @xmath50-beam facility as a representative example because the neutrino flux from such a facility spans up to @xmath51 gev with the peak around @xmath52 gev and is thus mostly sensitive to the quasielastic region explored here .",
    "details of the detector response can be found in ref .",
    "it is important to notice that we are only using the quasielastic contribution to the neutrino cross section depicted in fig.[fig : xsect ] . as an illustration we have focused on the dependence on the nuclear model adopted of two different observables , namely the _ cp and @xmath0 discovery potentials _ , defined as the values of the cp - violating phase @xmath53 and @xmath0 for which respectively the hypothesis of cp conservation @xmath54 or @xmath55",
    "can be excluded at 3@xmath38 after marginalizing over all other parameters .",
    "the cp discovery potential is shown in the left panel of fig.[fig : disc ] , where we superimposed the results obtained using the rfg cross section and the sf , rmf and rpa calculations .",
    "_ left panel : cp discovery potential in the @xmath56 plane .",

    "right panel : @xmath0 discovery potential._,title=\"fig : \" ]    we clearly see that , for @xmath57 ( where the sensitivity is maximal ) the rfg model gives a prediction which is around a factor 2 better than the sf , rmf and rpa models ( which , as expected , behave almost in the same way ) in @xmath58 and around a @xmath59 better than the rpa-2p2h .",
    "this is not surprising because the @xmath50-beam facility used in our simulations mainly probes energies smaller than @xmath60 gev , where the rfg is still larger than any other model ( see fig.[fig : xsect ] ) . for the other points in the parameter space , the difference is less evident but still significant .",
    "the difference in the sensitivity to @xmath0 can be seen in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : disc ] where we show the results in the @xmath61-plane . in this case",
    "the predictions of the sf , rmf and rpa models differ by up to a factor of @xmath62 compared to the rfg model for @xmath57 while the difference is less pronounced for @xmath63 .",
    "the rpa-2p2h results are more similar to the rfg for @xmath63 and to the other models for @xmath64 .",
    "this is also evident in the right panel where we show the cp fraction .    finally , it is interesting to comment on the effect of using different nuclear models also in the simultaneous determination of @xmath0 and @xmath53 .",
    "we have performed such an analysis for the input value @xmath65 ( not including degenerate solutions coming from our ignorance of the octant of @xmath66 @xcite and in the neutrino mass ordering ) finding that , using the rfg and rpa-2p2h models , we are able to reconstruct the true values of @xmath0 and @xmath53 within reasonable uncertainties , whereas with the other models we can only measure two distinct disconnected regions ( the fake one around the value of @xmath0 and @xmath64 ) , which worsen the global sensitivity on those parameters . in conclusion",
    ", we have analyzed the impact of five different theoretical models for the neutrino - nucleus charged current qe cross sections on the forecasted sensitivity of the future neutrino facilities to the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath53 .",
    "we have found that the sensitivities computed with the fg are better , by up to a factor of 2 , with respect to the other models .",
