    "in quantum information processing ( qip ) and in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) it is essential to be able to decouple the quantum bit or the spin , respectively , from its environment .",
    "both fields of research are of wide - spread interest and relevance . in the former",
    "the ultimate goal is to realize reliable long - time storage of quantum information with as low as possible error rates .",
    "this is a prerequisite for qip @xcite . in the latter ,",
    "the high - precision measurement of nuclear spin dynamics is a long - standing goal @xcite .",
    "besides choosing well - isolated systems the application of appropriately tailored sequences of control pulses @xcite , i.e. , dynamic decoupling ( dd ) , is one of the promising routes to this goal .",
    "the basic idea goes back to hahn s spin echo pulse which averages a static perturbance to zero @xcite . for a dynamic environment , or bath ,",
    "sequences of pulses are required @xcite .",
    "the early suggestions are essentially periodic in time .",
    "recently , the additional advantages of sequences with non - equidistant pulses were discovered .",
    "concatenation ( cdd ) can suppress unwanted couplings in a high power @xmath6 of the length of the sequence @xcite .",
    "but for the method used in ref .  , the required number @xmath0 of pulses grows exponentially with @xmath7 . for pure dephasing",
    ", it was shown that this growth can be reduced decisively to a linear one @xmath8 if the instants of @xmath1 pulses were chosen according to @xmath9 which is called udd ( uhrig dd ) .",
    "the relation was derived for a spin - boson model @xcite where it was observed that no details of the model entered . on the basis of numerical evidence and finite order recursion",
    "it was conjectured that is applicable to any dephasing model @xcite .",
    "this claim was finally proven@xcite for any order in @xmath3 .",
    "for various simulated classical noise spectra the experimental verification of the theoretical results was achieved @xcite by microwave control of the transition in be ions .",
    "the suppression of the decoherence of the electron spin of hydrogen radicals was investigated by electron spin resonance in crystals of irradiated malonic acid @xcite .",
    "the decoherence was due to the quantum noise induced by nuclear spins .",
    "again , the udd proved superior to standard sequences .    for general decoherence , concatenation of the udd sequence ( cudd ) can be used @xcite . for a suppression of the decoherence up to @xmath10 ,",

    "called quadratic dd ( qdd ) , which requires only a quadratically growing number of pulses , has been proposed very recently based on numerical @xcite and analytical evidence @xcite .",
    "all these sequences ( periodic dd @xcite , cdd @xcite , udd @xcite , cudd @xcite , and qdd @xcite ) rely on instantaneous , thus idealized , pulses .",
    "this problem was realized early on and ongoing research investigates pulses of finite duration @xmath12 @xcite and sequences of such pulses @xcite .",
    "eulerian dd @xcite is designed to annihilate the first order of a magnus expansion over the whole sequence .",
    "thus corrections of the order of @xmath13 are not excluded .",
    "similar caveats apply to many other sequences @xcite .",
    "also the experimental realizations in refs .",
    "have to take into account that real pulses can not be instantaneous because the control amplitudes are necessarily bounded .",
    "our aim here is to derive an optimized sequence with udd properties which relies on realistic pulses of finite duration and which is adapted to these real pulses .",
    "we do not provide a general scheme to use pulses of bounded control for arbitrary dd sequences .",
    "if the shape is appropriately designed , the pulse can be approximated as an instantaneous one up to @xmath14 .",
    "for @xmath15 explicit results were derived in ref .   while a recursive scheme for arbitrary @xmath16 has been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "as far as the correction @xmath14 is negligible , the proposed sequence displays the same exact analytic properties as the udd sequence of ideal , instantaneous pulses .",
    "we approach the problem hierarchically .",
    "that means that we use the pulses and the periods of free evolution as building blocks for the sequence .",
    "first , the properties of the pulses are derived and discussed .",
    "second , these properties are used in the sequence . to this end , we exploit scaling in two independent variables , namely the durations @xmath17 of the pulses , whose maximum is @xmath18 , and the total duration of the sequence denoted by @xmath3 .",
    "note that these two time scales are largely independent , both in theory and in experiment , because the pulses are not applied back to back .",
    "the only constraint is that @xmath3 must be larger than the sum of the pulse durations @xmath19 ( belonging to pulse @xmath20 ) @xmath21 relying on pulses , which cancel all orders @xmath22 , the whole sequence avoids all mixed terms @xmath23 , where @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "hence important progress over existing proposals @xcite is achieved .",
    "we start from the hamiltonian @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the @xmath27 component of the pauli matrices .",
    "it is acting on the @xmath28 spin or , generally , on the two - level system which represents a qubit .",
    "the operators @xmath29 act on the bath only ; they may also be c - numbers .",
    "we consider any kind of bath with bounded operators for the sake of the mathematical argument @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is any appropriate operator norm which remains invariant under unitary transforms .",
    "we expect that the order of suppression of the decoherence holds for any bath which can be approximated by bounded baths , i.e. , the bath should have a hard high - energy cutoff .",
    "no spin flip terms are included in implying an infinite spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath32 .",
    "it is an excellent approximation if @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the dephasing time .",
    "such a situation is achieved in the rotating reference frame of a system where the two levels with eigenvalues @xmath35 of @xmath26 lie energetically far apart .",
    "longitudinal relaxation and general decoherence will be addressed below .    moreover , is the effective hamiltonian in the interaction picture of the short control pulses @xcite",
    ". thus the switching function @xmath36 appears .",
    "the simplest example is an instantaneous @xmath1 pulse at @xmath37 which realizes a rotation about an axis perpendicular to @xmath26",
    ". then @xmath38 changes its sign at @xmath37 abruptly while it is constant elsewhere . a sequence of such pulses at the instants @xmath39 with @xmath40 implies @xmath41 for @xmath42 where we define @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "our derivation is based on the bounded quantum model .",
    "thereby , classical gaussian noise is treated to the extent that it can be approximated by the quantum model @xcite .",
    "certainly , non - gaussian classical noise , see for instance ref .",
    ", should be considered separately which is beyond the scope of the present article .",
    "optimization of the sequence means to ask the question which switching instants @xmath45 make the sequence @xmath39 most efficient . for ideal instantaneous pulses , it was shown that the udd instants are optimum in the sense that the time evolution depends on the spin weakly @xcite .",
    "the time evolution operator @xmath46(t_{j+1}-t_j)}\\ ] ] for the eigenstates of @xmath26 with eigenvalues @xmath47 depends on the spin only in a high power of @xmath3 @xmath48 the analytical derivation of is achieved by direct time - dependent perturbation theory ( tdpt ) @xcite in powers of @xmath49 .",
    "thus , if the @xmath50st power does not vanish it is of order @xmath51 .",
    "the iterated time integrations of tdpt are conveniently expressed by the substitution @xmath52 as integrations over the variable @xmath53 .",
    "the instants are equidistant if expressed in @xmath53 because for @xmath54 we have @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "allowing @xmath20 to take all integer values @xmath57 the function @xmath58 becomes an odd function with @xmath59 .",

    "the coefficients are @xmath64 . from this property , is derived by exploiting trigonometric addition theorems recursively @xcite .    the power of the udd sequence has been demonstrated experimentally @xcite . the noise , i.e.",
    ", the coupling to the bath @xmath65 , is simulated , so that it can be switched off during the pulse .",
    "thereby , a partial solution of the finiteness of the pulse amplitudes is achieved .",
    "but generally decoherence processes can not be switched off .",
    "using pulses of duration @xmath12 with constant amplitude instead of instantaneous pulses introduces an unwanted term of the order @xmath66 at each rotation , i.e. , linear in the pulse length . for a sequence of length @xmath0",
    "these corrections can accumulate to @xmath67 unless the contributions of subsequent pulses cancel each other .",
    "an improvement by one order in @xmath66 is achieved by the ersatz @xmath1 pulse which makes the linear correction vanish",
    ". then the time evolution operator @xmath68 for a pulse reads    [ eq : ansatz - dd ] @xmath69    where @xmath70 .",
    "it is understood that @xmath71 marks the beginning of the pulse and @xmath72 its end .",
    "it is important that @xmath73 is the hamiltonian of the total system , i.e. , spin , bath , and their mutual coupling , @xmath74 is the ideal pulse with @xmath75 , and @xmath76 is the instant when the approximated ideal pulse occurs . in a sequence @xmath39 ,",
    "the instant @xmath76 is to be identified with the switching instants @xmath45 .",
    "no adjustment of the sequence takes place .",
    "relation can be achieved by shaping the pulse appropriately @xcite .",
    "hence we can set up a udd sequence with more realistic pulses of the kind for which the deviations read @xmath77 with @xmath70 .",
    "the additivity of the corrections is a straightforward property of the unitary evolution operators .",
    "if we denote the udd sequence made from the ideal pulses @xmath78 in by @xmath79 , we know from @xmath80 for @xmath0 pulses .",
    "the unitary invariance of the norm @xmath81 is used for each pulse .",
    "next , we know from the properties of the udd sequence @xcite @xmath82 combined with this equation implies .",
    "the bound @xmath51 resulting from the sequence can be improved systematically by enlarging @xmath0 .",
    "the bound @xmath83 resulting from the pulses can be improved by making it shorter .",
    "but if this is not possible , one is stuck because the exponent of 2 can not be incremented for @xmath75 pulses as implied by mathematical no - go theorems @xcite .",
    "hence we are facing here a serious conceptual obstacle .",
    "recently a variant of    [ eq : ansatz - av ] @xmath84    with @xmath15 was shown @xcite to reduce the correction to @xmath85 .",
    "note that in only the hamiltonian @xmath86 of the bath occurs without coupling to the spin .",
    "hence @xmath87=0 $ ] holds and no @xmath76 needs to be introduced .",
    "explicit solutions are obtained for pure dephasing @xcite .",
    "the correlation time of the dephasing bath should not be much smaller than @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , no no - go theorem was found which prevents to achieve higher orders as well .",
    "indeed , a recursive scheme based on concatenation is proposed which achieves arbitrary order @xmath16 at exponential cost @xcite , i.e. , each composite @xmath1 pulse consists of @xmath88 elementary pulses .",
    "this demonstrates that in principle arbitrary @xmath16 can be achieved though the exponential cost may spoil its practical usefulness .",
    "but due to the shortness of the pulses compared to the whole sequence ( @xmath89 ) we do not expect that particularly large values of @xmath16 are required .",
    "the property is promising , but it _ can not _ be used in standard dd , or in udd in particular , as ersatz for an instantaneous pulse .",
    "this is so because any standard dd sequence presupposes that between the pulses @xmath90 the full hamiltonian @xmath73 , not only @xmath86 , is active .",
    "this conceptual obstacle can not be solved by pulse shaping because the no - go theorems block further progress@xcite .",
    "to overcome this obstacle is the main achievement of the present paper .",
    "we find that an adjustment of the sequence to the pulses of finite duration is required .",
    "our present fundamental observation is that relation translates to @xmath38 for a single realistic pulse between @xmath91 and @xmath92 in the form @xmath93 the @xmath1 pulse implies the inversion of the sign .",
    "but during the pulse itself the relation implies that the coupling between spin ( qubit ) and bath is effectively averaged to zero up to @xmath94 .",
    "this is so since @xmath86 in does not comprise the spin - bath coupling ; it only comprises the bath dynamics .",
    "this implies that the switching function @xmath38 takes the value zero during the pulse .",
    "note that there are jumps in the switching function even though the pulse is generated by bounded control .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that unitary time evolution is considered over _ finite _ time intervals , not over infinitesimal intervals .",
    "this means that from the hierarchical level of the sequence we do not look into the pulses .",
    "the description with @xmath38 is only valid on the level of the sequence , not within the pulse interval .",
    "furthermore , the correction term in eq .   may not be forgotten .",
    "next we look for a sequence with @xmath95 which corresponds to an odd function @xmath96 with the antiperiodic behavior @xmath97 .",
    "such a sequence , rudd ( realistic udd ) , allows for the same mathematical argument as udd ensuring that the effective time evolution of the spin is the identity up to corrections of the order @xmath51 .",
    "the reason is the antiperiodicity of the switching function which is the fundamental reason for the annihilation of the preceding orders @xcite .",
    "note that this argument holds only for udd and similar optimized sequences .",
    "hence we do not provide a general scheme for the incorporation of pulses of finite duration into arbitrary sequences .",
    "the sequence fulfilling the requirement of antiperiodicity reads @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "the fourier series comprises only the odd @xmath61 harmonics @xmath62 with coefficients .",
    "the parameter @xmath100 determines the duration of the pulses . except for the given inequality it is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "note that pulses of equal duration in @xmath53 do not correspond to pulses of equal duration in time @xmath71 @xmath101 with @xmath102 $ ] .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] where also the necessary time - dependent amplitudes @xmath104 defining the control hamiltonian @xmath105 are shown ; @xmath106 is the @xmath107 component of the pauli matrices . for instances",
    ", the amplitudes can be parametrized by @xmath108    there is one subtlety about the beginning and the end of the sequence . in order to generate the switching function",
    "there must be a first and a last pulse which averages the coupling between spin and bath to zero while inducing _ no _ net rotation .",
    "for this purpose @xmath109 can take any multiple of @xmath110 . solving the equations derived in ref .  ,",
    "which imply that the pulse fulfills the relation , leads to the parameters given in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] .",
    "( black solid and blue short - dashed lines ) for pulses rotating about axes in the @xmath111 plane and the resulting switching functions @xmath38 ( red dashed lines ) for @xmath112 @xmath1 pulses . for clarity ,",
    "fairly large values @xmath113 are chosen for the sake of clarity .",
    "for rendering purposes , @xmath114 is chosen here to depend on @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig : illustration ] ]    the duration of the pulses is shortest towards the ends of the interval @xmath3 for which the quantum state of the spin is to be stored . concomitantly , the amplitudes are largest for the first and the last pulse . in practice ,",
    "the initial and the final pulse can be combined with the pulses by which the quantum state of the spin ( the qubit ) is generated , for instance a @xmath124 pulse ( for solutions see ref .  ) .",
    "what has been achieved by the sequence depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] ?",
    "this sequence is an optimized dynamic decoupling scheme made from pulses of finite duration and finite amplitudes with analytically founded properties .",
    "bounded control is a crucial aspect for realistic sequences , so that the proposed sequence is an important step closer to a realistic scenario . nevertheless , the sequence is still optimized in the sense that it shares the same power law property as the udd built from instantaneous pulses .",
    "there are two sources for corrections in the unitary time evolution @xmath125 of the rudd sequence .",
    "the first kind of corrections stems from the pulses which are only close to @xmath126 but not identical to it , see eq .  .",
    "denoting the time evolution of the rudd sequence made from the pulses @xmath126 in by @xmath127 we know from @xmath128 for @xmath0 pulses .",
    "the second kind of corrections stems from the sequence itself .",
    "the time evolution @xmath127 is rigorously governed by @xmath129 defined in .",
    "then we know from ref .   that @xmath130 the total correction is given by the sum of both kinds of corrections because their norm is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "so in analogy to we obtain @xmath131 we stress that this relation excludes mixed terms @xmath132 with @xmath24 and @xmath22 because each pulse complies with separately .",
    "we point out that @xmath16 does not need to be as large as @xmath0 because the pulses are much shorter anyway .",
    "so the relatively short and simple pulse found in ref .",
    "realizing @xmath15 may often be completely sufficient .    for later reference , we point out that the above derivation also holds if we allow for an explicit analytic time dependence of the operators @xmath86 and @xmath65 in .",
    "this was recently shown by us in the context of optimized dynamic decoupling for time dependent hamiltonians@xcite relying only on the mathematical properties of the switching function @xmath133 .",
    "hence the same argument also applies to the rudd sequence if the pulses are shaped to realize zero coupling during their duration , see eq .   .",
    "this is definitely the case if there is no time dependence _ during _ the pulses because the pulses suggested in refs .   and can be used .",
    "this is indeed a relevant case as we will discuss below .",
    "we emphasize that the rudd with provides an efficient scheme for dynamic decoupling based on bounded control .",
    "it is the main result of our paper .",
    "the previously obstructive no - go theorems @xcite can be circumvented by the rudd approach .",
    "the qualitative novel finding in the present work is that the sequence has to be adjusted in a precise way in order to allow for realistic pulses while preserving the properties of the sequence of ideal pulses .",
    "above we constructed a precise prescription which achieves the necessary adjustment .",
    "we expect that this observation extends beyond the case of udd and rudd .",
    "this expectation is illustrated in the next section .",
    "we emphasize that the number of pulses @xmath0 can not be made infinite without using shorter and shorter pulses with larger and larger amplitudes .",
    "hence a given bound to the available power of the control pulses limits the maximum possible number of pulses for a given interval @xmath3 .",
    "but such limits exist in any experimental setup anyway @xcite and we expect that the rudd approach will prove its usefulness for a moderate number of pulses .",
    "the limit @xmath134 is studied here to characterize the mathematical properties of the idealized situation .",
    "the achievement of the rudd over the udd sequence is that for any finite duration @xmath3 and finite number of pulses @xmath0 only pulses of finite amplitude are needed .",
    "in view of the above we expect that the famous cpmg sequence @xcite can be improved for realistic pulses as follows .",
    "the cpmg is given by the @xmath135-fold iteration of the two - pulse cycle @xmath136 , where @xmath1 stands for a @xmath1 pulse and @xmath71 for free evolution of time @xmath71 .",
    "this two - pulse cycle is the udd sequence for @xmath137 pulses @xcite .",
    "hence for pulses of finite duration the iteration of the @xmath137 panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : illustration ] suggests itself .",
    "a slight modification is possible by replacing two @xmath110 pulses , where two cycles meet , by one @xmath110 pulse of double the length .",
    "hence it is promising to use the sequence @xmath138^{n-1}- \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\qquad -t_2-\\pi_{\\tau_\\mathrm{p}}-2t_2-\\pi_{\\tau_\\mathrm{p}}- t_2-(2\\pi)_{t_1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath139 , @xmath140 , and @xmath141 .",
    "the subscripts indicate the pulse durations .",
    "we iterate that the advocated recipe to account for bounded control only applies to udd - type sequences .",
    "the advocated rudd sequence relies on its mathematical properties which have a certain beauty in themselves .",
    "but the ultimate check will be its experimental usefulness . a crucial step on this route",
    "is an experiment with simulated noise such as the one performed for udd @xcite .",
    "there , the simulated noise was switched off during the pulse .",
    "the theoretical calculations took this dead time of the noise into account .",
    "but variable pulse lengths such as in rudd were not considered .",
    "we propose to implement the rudd according to with pulses of finite , constant amplitudes during the intervals where @xmath142 .",
    "no pulse shaping is required if the noise is switched off during the pulse so that @xmath142 is fulfilled by construction .",
    "hence we have @xmath143 for this particular experiment instead of .",
    "the pulse intervals have to be chosen as in .",
    "concomitantly the amplitudes have to vary to ensure that the pulses are @xmath1 pulses . in this way any deviation resulting from the pulses is eliminated .",

    "a udd sequence can also suppress longitudinal relaxation @xcite .",

    "the pulse @xmath149 induces an inversion of the sign of the couplings along @xmath145 and @xmath106 .    to see this one has to modify the specific calculation for a rotation about a fixed axis in ref .",

    "these conditions are exactly the same as those reported in ref .   for pure dephasing .",
    "hence they have the same solutions and the pulses depicted in fig .",
    "1 make the first and the second order corrections vanish also for longitudinal relaxation .",
    "no changes in the pulse shapes are required . up to the third order ,",
    "the transverse coupling is suppressed and only the @xmath27-coupling survives unaltered .",
    "between two subsequent pulses the sign of the @xmath144 and @xmath107 coupling is inverted . for pulses corrected in higher order @xmath174 corrections",
    "we again refer to ref .   for a proof - of - principle construction .",
    "hence , the rudd sequence is equally applicable for the suppression of longitudinal relaxation .",

    "the decohering coupling along this axis is not suppressed .",
    "the case of pure dephasing can be seen as special case of the more general case discussed here : there is no coupling along the axis of rotation and only one ( out of two possible ) perpendicular coupling .",
    "to tackle general decoherence the combination of at least two sequences of rotations about perpendicular spin axes are used .",
    "available schemes rely on recursive concatenation as for cdd @xcite or cudd @xcite or on a single step concatenation as for qdd @xcite .",
    "hence it is natural to consider concatenation of rudd sequences of rotations about two perpendicular spin axes .    for simplicity",
    "we consider the qdd scheme which comprises two levels . on the first level two ( e.g. , @xmath175 and @xmath176 ) of the three couplings @xmath177 to the components of @xmath178",

    "this is exactly what is achieved by a rudd of @xmath179 rotations about @xmath27 for longitudinal relaxation as discussed in the previous section .- coupling and eliminate them first .",
    "but we stress that in our theoretical treatment no spin axis is special .",
    "thus the first suppression can also be done by @xmath144- or @xmath107-rotations suppressing the corresponding perpendicular couplings , i.e. , the @xmath107 and @xmath27 couplings or the @xmath144 and @xmath27 couplings , respectively . ] up to the corrections @xmath180 of the primary level , the resulting time evolution is given an effective hamiltonian which implies dephasing only .",

    "the effective hamiltonian is of the form given in eq .   , but with time dependent operators @xmath182 and @xmath183 . the time dependence of these operatores is analytical since it results from the time evolution for the time interval @xmath181 given by the schrdinger equation on the primary level .",
    "note that it is understood that all the switching instants are chosen relative to @xmath181",
    ". then a udd sequence of duration @xmath184 can be applied on the secondary level@xcite which consists of @xmath185 rotations about the spin @xmath144 or @xmath107 axis to suppress dephasing up to corrections @xmath186 .",
    "this means that general decoherence can be suppressed by a rudd on the primary and a udd on the secondary level .    to obtain a quadratic scheme using pulses of finite duration we use a rudd also on the secondary level , calling the resulting scheme qrudd",
    "this is possible since in the derivation of the rudd for pure dephasing in sect .",
    "[ sect : dephasing ] we mentioned that the initial hamiltonian may display an analytic time dependence .",
    "this effective time dependence results here from the pulse sequence on the primary level .",
    "thus it is by construction not present _ during _ the secondary pulses .",
    "these secondary pulses have to be constructed in the presence of general decoherence @xmath187 so that the explicit solution in ref .   can not be used .",
    "but the equations to be solved are given in sufficient generality in this reference . for a proof - of - existence",
    "we refer to the work by khodjasteh _",
    "_ where concatenated solutions for such pulses are constructed recursively @xcite .",
    "hence , the known mathematical properties of udd sequences and of @xmath1 pulses suffice to conclude that even general decoherence can be efficiently suppressed by dynamic decoupling with bounded control by means of this qrudd scheme .",
    "it is a quadratic scheme of udd sequences of bounded , and thus essentially realistic , control pulses .",
    "we derived in this paper that an optimized sequence of realistic pulses ( rudd ) , i.e. , of finite duration and amplitude , can be set up which suppresses dephasing or longitudinal relaxation up to @xmath188 in the length of the sequence and up to @xmath189 in the maximum duration of the pulses , avoiding all mixed terms in contrast to previous proposals .",
    "this statement is based on rigorous analytical calculations for bounded baths and it is expected to apply to systems with hard high - energy cutoff . our argument is based on the fundamental mathematical property of the optimized sequences of udd - type , namely a certain antiperiodicity in the auxiliary variable @xmath53 .",
    "thus it only applies to such sequences and not to arbitrary sequences .",
    "we introduced and exploited the concept of double scaling in the durations @xmath12 of the pulses _ and _ in the duration @xmath3 of the whole sequence .",
    "we emphasize that both scales can be varied independently except for a certain constraint , see eq .  .",
    "the key achievement is to establish a precise prescription how the sequence has to be adjusted to allow for the use of pulses with bounded amplitudes , which are thus decisively more realistic . only the adjustment of the sequence to the use of tailored pulses of finite duration allowed us to circumvent no - go theorems @xcite concerning the properties of tailored pulses .",
    "the proposed rudd can be used for suppressing pure dephasing , i.e. , suppressing coupling of the bath to one spin component , or for suppressing longitudinal relaxation , i.e. , suppressing coupling of the bath to two spin components .",
    "general decoherence , i.e. , suppressing coupling of the bath to all three spin components , can not be suppressed by a single rudd but by a quadratic concatenated scheme ( qrudd ) of two rudds , made from rotations about two perpendicular spin axes .",
    "based on the known properties of udd @xcite and qdd @xcite , we think that the design of the sequences is very close to its optimum .",
    "but we expect that the design of the pulses can still be improved . while for @xmath15 ( leading non - vanishing correction is cubic in @xmath12 )",
    "rather simple pulse shapes are known @xcite , for higher order pulses with @xmath174 recursive concatenation provides a recipe for their construction at the expense of an exponential increase in the number of elementary pulses @xcite .    certainly , further research is called for to determine the performance of rudd and qrudd for specific models .",
    "one important issue is to determine the size of the prefactors of the neglected terms .",
    "another issue on the way to the experimental application of rudd and qrudd is to investigate the robustness of both the tailored pulses and the sequences to imperfections such as imprecise timing .    to stimulate further research on the experimental side we proposed an experimental setup to verify the rudd for simulated noise which can be switched off @xcite so that a rudd can be checked without pulse shaping"
