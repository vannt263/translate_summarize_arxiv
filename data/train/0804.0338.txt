    "in this paper we propose a new attempt to study motions in interfaces of fluid mixtures .",
    "first , we recall the study of interfaces between mixture bulks in equilibrium .",
    "we remind problems for an interface moving in a single fluid and extend them to cases of mixtures .    how to calculate the proportions of constituents in each bulk of a n - components mixture ?",
    "this problem is solved in the case of isothermal equilibrium for mixtures whose free energy is known [ 7 ] .",
    "a simple calculus consists in writing the total free energy of the mixture is minimum .",
    "practically , calculus are available only if :    - the container has a simple shape allowing one dimension calculus ( cylinder or sphere )    - the mixture has a few number of components    - the mixture free energy is not a too complex function of component densities and temperature .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 the density of constituent _ i _ ; @xmath1 is the density of the mixture , @xmath2 the specific volume and @xmath3 the concentration of constituent _ i_. the volume free energy at temperature @xmath4 is in the form @xmath5 the total free energy is the sum of the thermodynamic free energy and the interfacial energy .    the determination of the function @xmath6 is certainly of first importance , but it is not the topic of this paper .",
    "this is both a theoretical and an experimental problem and an equation of state with coefficients given by experiments is used for calculations .",
    "the free energy must be independent of the proportion of constituents when the density is vanishing [ 5,15,18 ] .    in the case of flat interface ,",
    "the knowledge of interfacial energy is not necessary for the calculation of balance equations between the bulks .",
    "the knowledge of interfacial energy is necessary to study spherical interfaces ( bulks , drops , aerosols ... ) . a landau - ginzburg model consisting in a quadratic form of density gradients representing the interfacial energy [ 12 ]",
    ". coefficients of the quadratic form are assumed to be constant ( in the case of a single fluid , this corresponds to a _",
    "mean field theory _ [ 16 ] ) .",
    "a quadratic form of the gradients of specific volumes can be also used ; nevertheless , assuming that the coefficients of the quadratic form are constant , it has a different physical meaning .",
    "in fact , the choice of a model is of no consequence outside of the interfacial layer .",
    "the landau - ginzburg model represents an interface and the bulks and builds a complete theory of the mixtures in dynamics [ 8,9,13 ] .    in this paper ,",
    "we apply the model to motions through interfaces for both single fluids and mixtures .",
    "because of physic scales , motions can be often considered as permanent [ 4 ] .",
    "interface moving in a single fluid was investigated by slemrod [ 20 - 21 ] as a traveling wave whose image in a reference space is propagating with the constant velocity @xmath7 .",
    "it is equivalent to say the fluid crosses a stationary interface with the flow @xmath8 [ 4 ] ( @xmath8 is the product of velocity and density ) .",
    "when dissipative phenomena are neglected , the problem boils down to equilibrium with a specific free energy increased with @xmath9 .",
    "the general study of mixtures in dynamics can be applied in the case of interfaces [ 9 ] .",
    "the constituent _ i _ crosses the interface with the flow @xmath10 .",
    "we are back to a static problem with the same specific free energy and an additional term in the form @xmath11 each constituent of the mixture has its own reference space [ 1,9,17 ] . due to the fact that the interface has different velocities in each reference space ,",
    "the generalization of traveling wave is less intuitive .    for a @xmath12-component mixture , a permanent motion through an interface yields @xmath13 equations of _ dynamical _ equilibrium .",
    "the equations represent a linear system of the @xmath14 variables @xmath15 and @xmath4 . when the specific volume @xmath16 and the concentrations @xmath17 are given in each bulk , a simple calculus yields the temperature of the mixture and the flow for each constituent .",
    "obviously , solutions are acceptable only if values @xmath15 and @xmath18 are positive .    surprisingly , the problem of an interface in equilibrium is more difficult to study than the dynamical problem . it is more difficult to choose @xmath15 and @xmath4 ( @xmath19 is null in equilibrium case ) and to deduce concentrations and specific volume than to choose concentrations and specific volume in each bulk and to deduce @xmath15 and @xmath4 from a system of linear equations",
    "let us consider the one dimensional motion of van der waals like fluid .",
    "we notice that the same equations describe a traveling wave of dynamic phase transition and a flow through an interface in the case of permanent motion .",
    "m. slemrod [ 21 ] consider the one - dimensional motion of fluid possessing a specific free energy of the form ] : @xmath20where @xmath21 is the lagrangian mass variable , @xmath22 is a small positive parameter . in the referential space ,",
    "the balance laws of motion may be written in the form :    @xmath23    where @xmath24 denotes the velocity of the fluid , @xmath25 the viscosity , @xmath26 the pressure , @xmath27 the specific total energy , @xmath28 the coefficient proportionality between the heat flux and the gradient of temperature in the fourier law and @xmath29 . the traveling wave theory of phase transitions attempts to determine when",
    "two homogeneous phases may be joined by a traveling wave solution @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 of equations ( 1 ) .",
    "slemrod finds that the volume mass is solution of the equation : @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath35 denotes the values of @xmath26 and @xmath16 in the bulks . because of the physical scales far from critical conditions , we established in [ 4 ] the motions of van der waals fluids crossing interlayers can be considered as permanent . in the case of permanent motion of inviscid fluid , eq .",
    "( 1)@xmath36 yields @xmath37where @xmath38 denotes eulerian variable and @xmath39 [ 20 ] . from @xmath40 where @xmath8 denotes the constant flow of the fluid for an unidimensional permanent motion ,",
    "we deduce : @xmath41at @xmath42 given , the form of the equation is similar to eq . ( 2 ) , which allows to obtain interpretations about dynamical maxwell rule as in [ 20 - 21 ] .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we study a mixture of two fluids .",
    "the method can be immediately extended to any number of constituents .",
    "no assumption has to be done about composition or miscibility .",
    "the motion of a two - fluid continuum can be represented with two surjective differentiable mappings : @xmath43 ( subscripts 1 and 2 are associated with each constituent of the mixture )    @xmath44 and @xmath45 denote the positions of each constituent in reference spaces @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the lagrangian of the mixture is : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the velocity vectors of each constituent , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the densities , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the extraneous force potentials depending only on @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the volume internal energy .",
    "the expansion of the lagrangian is in a general form .",
    "in fact dissipative phenomena imply that @xmath49 is almost equal to @xmath50 and we do not take into account some kinetic energy associated with the relative velocity of the components .",
    "because of the interaction between the constituents , @xmath57 does not divide into energies related to each constituent of the mixture , like for _ simple mixtures of fluids _ [ 14 ] .",
    "the mixture is supposed to be no chemically reacting .",
    "conservations of masses require : @xmath58    where subscript i belongs to @xmath591,2@xmath60 . at t fixed ,",
    "the jacobian associated with @xmath61 is denoted by @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the reference specific mass in @xmath64 .    in differentiable cases , eq .",
    "( 3 ) is equivalent to : @xmath65 the volumic internal energy @xmath57 is given by the thermodynamic behavior of the mixture .",
    "each constituent has a specific mass ; in the same way , two specific entropies @xmath66 and @xmath67 are supposed to be associated with constituents 1 and 2 .    for an internal energy depending on gradients of densities ,",
    "the volume internal energy is : @xmath68 the quantity @xmath69 _ defines the specific enthalpy of the constituent i of the mixture_. subscript @xmath70 corresponds to the spatial derivatives associated with gradient terms ; as usually , summation is made on repeated subscript @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath71 _ defines the temperature of the constituent i of the mixture_.    in practise we use the expression @xmath72    where @xmath73 is a quadratic form with constant coefficients : @xmath74 and @xmath75 is the value of internal energy in the homogeneous bulks .    to obtain the equations of motions , we used variational principle whose original feature is to choice variations in reference spaces ( fig .",

    "1 ]    0.25 cm    figure 1    variations @xmath76 and @xmath77 of motions of particles are deduced from @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "they are associated with a two - parameter family of virtual motions of the mixture .",
    "the real motion corresponds to @xmath80 and @xmath81 . obviously , a classical variation of function in space @xmath82 ( as serrin s p. 145 , [ 19",
    "] ) with only one parameter can not give as many informations as the ones given by any two - parameters family of virtual displacements .",
    "the equation of the motion of each constituent of the mixture is : @xmath83 let us note that the motion of each constituent is described by the same equation that for a single fluid [ 10,19 ] . in applications ,",
    "the motions are supposed to be isothermal and @xmath84 ( @xmath85 common temperature value for all the components ) .",
    "this case corresponds to strong heat exchange between components .",
    "( 5 ) yields : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the free specific enthalpy ( or chemical potential ) of constituent i. in the bulks , the volumic free energy associated with @xmath88 is denoted by @xmath89 a complete study of the barycentric motion of the mixture and of the equation of energy is given in [ 9 ] .",
    "this generalizes results for single fluid [ 3,6,11 ] .",
    "an interface in a two - phase mixture is generally schematized by a surface without thickness . far from critical conditions , this layer is of molecular size and density and entropy gradients are very large .",
    "a continuous model schematizes such areas by using an energy in form ( 4 ) extending forms given in [ 2,16 ] for compressible fluids .    for the same reasons than for a single fluid",
    ", motion is supposed to be isothermal , stationary and one dimensional with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "the acceleration of component _ i _ is : @xmath90and the equations of motion yield : @xmath91or : @xmath92    ( the derivatives along the motion axis are denoted by @xmath93 ) .",
    "combination of the last two equations yields the first integral : @xmath94 in each bulk , densities have zero - gradients . eliminating constants @xmath95 , dynamical conditions through the interfacial layer yield : @xmath96=0 \\\\",

    "in fact , a complete study of the thickness of the interfacial layer or of spherical interfaces of microscopic size requires the non - linear model .",

    "one deduces : @xmath149    other equations of state are proposed for example @xmath150 ( particularly in petroleum industry [ 5,15,18 ] ) or by changing the form of the mixing rules ( other expressions than @xmath151 can be considered ) .",
