    "the radio galaxy 3c  120 ( redshift @xmath7=0.033 ) is a powerful and variable emitter of radiation at radio to x - ray frequencies , probably powered by a central black hole of at least @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "it was among the first radio jets in which apparent superluminal motion was detected @xcite .",
    "previous observations using the very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 22 and 43 ghz @xcite reveal a very rich inner jet structure containing up to ten different superluminal components .",
    "coordinated millimeter vlbi array ( cmva ) observations at 86 ghz @xcite , at an angular resolution of 54 @xmath9as , provide an upper limit to the size of the core of @xmath10 lt - month .",
    "results from long - term milliarcsecond - scale monitoring at 1.7 , 5 , and 10.7 ghz @xcite allowed determination of superluminal motions up to at least 150 pc in projection from the core , as well as evidence for stationary features suggestive of a helical pattern viewed in projection .",
    "further monitoring at a higher frequency , consisting of 16 monthly polarimetric 22 ghz vlba observations of 3c  120 @xcite , explored a more compact region in the jet , where superluminal components undergo variations in total and linearly polarized flux densities on timescales of months .",

    "we observed 3c  120 with the 10 antennas of the vlba at a frequency of 43 ghz at the following epochs : 1997 nov . 10 , 1997 dec . 11 , 1998 jan .",

    "the data were recorded in 1-bit sampling vlba format with 32 mhz bandwidth per circular polarization .",
    "reduction of the data was performed with the aips software in the usual manner ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "opacity corrections were introduced by solving for receiver temperature and zenith opacity at each antenna .",
    "the instrumental polarization was determined using the feed - solution algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "the feed d - terms ( instrumental polarization ) were found to be very consistent over all sources observed and to remain stable .",
    "the absolute phase offset between right- and left - circularly polarized data ( which determines the polarization position - angle calibration ) was obtained by comparison of the integrated polarization of the vlba images of several compact sources ( 0420 - 014 , oj287 , bl  lac , and 3c  454.3 ) with 14 very large array ( vla ) observations at epochs 1997 nov .",

    "the images , plotted in fig . [ 43ghzims ] , reveal a rich , variable structure in both total and linearly polarized intensity . in order to identify and follow discrete features across epochs , we performed model fits of the _ u - v _ data with circular gaussian components using the software difmap @xcite , which was also used to edit the data and make the final images .",
    "figure [ modfits ] shows the positions and magnetic polarization direction for the fitted components at all epochs .",
    "inspection of this figure reveals that , at a distance of approximately 2 mas from the core ( the closest distance at which we can resolve the jet across its width ) , bright features usually lie near the edge of the jet , suggesting limb brightening .",
    "this stratification is even more apparent in polarization : magnetic vectors on the northern side of the jet are oblique to the jet axis but constant in orientation , while those on the southern side rotate as the polarized emission features move downstream ( e.g. , components _ h _ and _ l _ in fig .",
    "[ modfits ] ) .",
    "this is similar to the behavior observed at 22 ghz @xcite .",

    "the initially perpendicular magnetic vector at epoch 1998 march 9 is observed to align with the jet axis by 1998 may 8 .",

    "the magnetic vector subsequently rotates more slowly in components _",

    "opacity effects , which can produce a rotation of 90@xmath11 ( as observed in oj  287 ; * ? ? ?",

    "o1 _ and _ o2 _ have steep , optically thin spectra .",
    "although faraday rotation could contribute to the observed rotation of the magnetic polarization vectors , an alternative interpretation would be the existence of an underlying helical magnetic field with a progressively increasing pitch angle until the magnetic field becomes aligned ( as observed at larger scales , * ? ? ?",
    "this would be in agreement with the observed variation in the position angles of the core - component separations   and the twisted internal structure of component _ o _ , the latter of which is most clearly visible at epochs 1998 june 11 , july 11 , and august 13 ( see fig . [ 43ghzims ] ) .",
    "this interpretation would also agree with the suggested helical pattern at larger scales @xcite .      by epoch 1998",

    "the subsequent evolution of these two emission regions is significantly different : while _ o1 _ and _ o2 _ move with a relatively constant proper motion , fig .",

    "m2_. by epoch 1998 september 16 a similar split takes place , leading to the appearance of components _ m _ and _ m1_. the evolution of the jet following the disturbance that created component _ o _ therefore involves steady , fast superluminal motion at the front , followed by the ( in some cases temporary ) appearance of slower secondary features in the wake .",
    "the last epochs in figs .",
    "[ 43ghzims ] and [ trlcp ] show that the strongest feature in the wake of component _ o _ is that labeled _",

    "this is a factor @xmath6 slower than any of the other moving components detected in 3c  120 ( see fig .",

    "images at 22 ghz @xcite also contain component _ m _ , but with a proper motion compatible with stationarity ( @xmath160.35@xmath31.10 mas yr@xmath2 ) ; however , the resolution was about twice as coarse as that at 43 ghz .",
    "the polarization of _ m _ is strong at 22 ghz , with magnetic vector direction ( relative to the direction between _ m _ and the core ) of 24 , 19 , and 27@xmath11 and degree of polarization of 25 , 20 , and 15% , at epochs 1999 january 10 , 1999 february 10 and 1999 march 19 , respectively .",

    "the nature of the components that appear on the wake of component _ o _ is consistent with the characteristics of the trailing   features that appear behind a major flow disturbance in relativistic time - dependent hydrodynamical and emission simulations of jets @xcite .",
    "these simulations show that strong jet perturbations ( which we associate with bright superluminal knots ) interact with the underlying jet and external medium as they propagate .",
    "this leads to the formation of recollimation shocks and rarefactions in the wake of the main perturbation .",
    "these formations are triggered by pinch body jet instabilities .",
    "@xcite predict that trailing components should appear to split from the primary component rather than emerge from the core , and to have significantly slower proper motions than that of the leading strong knot .",
    "the apparent velocities of the trailing features should range from subluminal closest to the core to more superluminal near the leading knot .",
    "this is in good agreement with the nature of component _ m _ , which indeed appears to split from component _ o _ and to move at a slower speed .",
    "alternatively , component _ m _ may correspond to a reverse shock of component _ o _ that is slower than the forward shock represented by subcomponents _",
    "o1 _ and   _ o2 _ in this interpretation .",
    "the subluminal motions of components _ r _ and _ s _ are also consistent with the predictions for trailing components .",
    "the good agreement between the changing emission pattern observed in 3c  120 and the structures predicted by 2-d , relativistic , cylindrically symmetric hydrodynamical and emission simulations @xcite points to the value of such computations for interpreting observations of real jets .",
