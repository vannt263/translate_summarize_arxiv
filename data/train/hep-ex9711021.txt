    "two  photon interactions have been previously studied at @xmath2colliders . heavy ",
    "ion colliders are particularly attractive for investigating these reactions because the electromagnetic fields of the protons add coherently .    in the weizscker ",
    "williams method the electromagnetic field of a relativistic , charged particle is treated as a pulse of photons . for a spherically symmetric charge distribution with radius @xmath3 ,",
    "the photon energy spectrum integrated over impact parameter from @xmath3 to infinity is : @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the photon energy @xcite .    when calculating the @xmath1luminosity in heavy ",
    "ion collisions , it is necessary to exclude the region of nuclear overlap ( @xmath7 ) , as in this region hadronic interactions dominate .",
    "the equivalent two  photon luminosity is@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the single photon distribution ( eq .  1 ) and @xmath10 is a function which takes into account the overlap effect : @xmath11    the two  photon luminosity thus essentially scales as @xmath12 , and this is a major advantage of heavy  ion colliders . figure  1 shows the luminosity for various nuclear systems at rhic@xcite .",
    "the two  photon luminosity will be competitive with that at @xmath2colliders , such as cleo and lepii , up to a center  of  mass energy of about 1.5  gev .",
    "the main detector of the star experiment at rhic will be a large ( @xmath1350  m@xmath14 ) , cylindrical time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the tpc will track and reconstruct momenta of charged particles in the pseudo  rapidity interval @xmath15 .",
    "two smaller forward time projection chambers ( ftpc ) will cover the interval @xmath16 .",
    "one of the major challenges in studying two  photon interactions in a nuclear experiment will be to trigger on these interactions without collecting too many background events .",
    "the star trigger system is well suited for this purpose .",
    "the main tpc will be covered with an array of 240 plastic scintillators , which will measure the charged particle multiplicity in the interval @xmath17 and which will serve as trigger detectors .",
    "the tpc anode wires will provide multiplicity information for @xmath18 for the trigger .",
    "the raw data from the scintillator array and the wire chambers will be available in less than 1  @xmath19s .",
    "more accurate multiplicity information will be available after about 100  @xmath19s . in the highest trigger level , after 10  ms , some tracking and momentum information from the tpc will also be available",
    ". this will enable the primary vertex to be located and the @xmath20 to be determined .",
    "the different trigger levels and their respective time ",
    "scales are summarized in table  1 .",
    "central au+au events will be recorded at a rate of about 1  hz . the data acquisition system will , however , be flexible enough to allow the recording of smaller events , such as two  photon interactions , at a higher rate .",

    "the production and background rates of the following three systems have been studied : a lepton pair ( @xmath24 ) , a single meson decaying into 2 charged particle ( @xmath25 ) and a meson pair decaying into 4 charged particles ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "these systems should thus be representative of a wide selection of two  photon final states .",
    "all three systems were simulated using starlight , a two  photon monte ",

    "photon transverse momenta are generated with a gaussian form factor with width @xmath27 .",
    "four sources of background have been considered : peripheral ( hadronic ) nucleus  nucleus collisions , beam  gas interactions , @xmath0nucleus interactions , and cosmic rays .",
    "cosmic rays and beam  gas reactions are a problem mainly at the trigger stage . off  line",
    ", it will be possible to accurately find the primary vertex and thence minimize the cosmic ray contribution and reduce the background beam  gas interactions .",

    "the largest background component is photonuclear interactions .",
    "the trigger rates can be compared to the trigger rate from muon ",
    "pairs from @xmath1 interactions , 4.7  hz . the ratio of signal to background for @xmath19production will thus be roughly 2:1 , already at the trigger level .    in order to separate signals from background ,",
    "cuts have been developed which utilize the characteristics of two  photon interactions .",
    "the most important of these cuts are : ( a ) multiplicity : many two  photon reactions lead to a final state with either 2 or 4 charged particles , and in the analysis it is required that no additional particles are present in the event .",
    "( b ) transverse momentum : the summed transverse momentum ( @xmath30 ) of the final state will be small ( @xmath31 ) . in the analysis presented here a cut of @xmath32  40",
    "mev / c was used .",
    "( c ) center  of  mass rapidity : the rapidity distribution of the @xmath1 system is centered around 0 with a fairly narrow width ( @xmath33 ) . in the analysis a cut of @xmath34  1.0 was applied .",
    "a cut on @xmath35 reduces the number of beam  gas and photonuclear interactions , since these are characterized by asymmetric particle emission relative to the au+au center  of  mass system .",
    "the expected integrated rates for @xmath36 and @xmath37 near threshold ( 1.5 @xmath38 1.6  gev / c@xmath39 ) for one year of running is presented in table  3 .",
    "one year corresponds to @xmath40  s of beam  time at the rhic design luminosity for au+au ( @xmath41  @xmath42s@xmath43 ) . for the rates in table  3 ,",
    "a cut was also applied in invariant mass of the final state . for @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath44 was required to be within @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the natural width , and for @xmath37 it was required that @xmath47  gev / c@xmath39 .",
    "both of these signals can be clearly separated from background .",
    "the backgrounds estimated by fritiof and venus differ considerably for hadronic a+a interactions .",
    "the reason for this is not entirely understood .",
    "the two models are in general agreement regarding multiplicity .",
    "the differences occur when cuts are applied in for instance @xmath30 . of course ,",
    "neither of these models have been compared with data from heavy ",
    "ion reactions at rhic energies .",
    "the difference between the models can be taken as a measure of the systematic error in the estimate .",
    "as at the trigger level , the largest source of background seems to be photonuclear interactions .",

    "to summarize , we have shown that ultra  relativistic heavy ",
