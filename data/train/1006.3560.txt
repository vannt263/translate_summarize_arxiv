    "long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( lgrbs ) , thought to be generated during the core - collapse of massive stars ( woosley 1993 ) , are among the most energetic phenomena observed in the universe .",
    "lgrbs are typically associated with star - forming host environments and young massive star progenitors . as a result",
    ", a number of studies cite these explosive events as potential unbiased tracers of the star formation and metallicity history of the universe at high redshifts ( e.g. , bloom et al .  2002 , fynbo et al .",
    "2006a , chary et al .",
    "2007 , savaglio et al .  2009 ) .",
    "however , several recent studies have uncovered a connection between lgrbs and low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "such a trend could potentially challenge the use of these phenomena as tracers of star formation in normal galaxies at large look - back times .",
    "much of the previous work on lgrbs and their metallicities has focused on a comparison with the standard luminosity - metallicity ( _ l - z _ ) relation for star - forming galaxies .",
    "stanek et al .  ( 2006 ) examined the host galaxies of 5 @xmath3 lgrbs and found that their metallicities were lower than equally - luminous dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "kewley et al .",
    "( 2007 ) noted that these @xmath3 lgrbs occupied the same position on the _ l - z _ diagram as low - metallicity galaxies , falling below the general relation for dwarf irregular galaxies .",
    "modjaz et al .",
    "( 2008 ) similarly found that lgrb host galaxies had lower metallicities than the host galaxies of nearby broad - lined type ic supernovae .",
    "fynbo et al .",
    "( 2008 ) adopt a theoretical _ l - z _",
    "relation for use with higher - redshift ( @xmath10 ) observations of lgrb hosts , suggesting that these higher - redshift hosts may be good representative samples of higher - redshift star - forming galaxies .",
    "the mass - metallicty ( _ m - z _ ) relation is cited as the fundamental property that drives the observed _ l - z _ relation . while luminosity is often adopted as a proxy for stellar mass , a galaxy s luminosity is also extremely dependent on star formation rate ( sfr ) and star formation history as well as metallicity , and thus does not effectively isolate stellar mass as a parameter . the _",
    "relation for nearby galaxies may be attributable to the larger neutral gas fractions and more efficient stripping of heavy elements by galactic winds in lower - mass galaxies ( mcgaugh & de blok 1997 , bell & de jong 2000 , boselli et al .",
    "2001 , garnett 2002 , tremonti et al .",
    "2004 ) , though this may not be the dominant effect driving the _ m - z _ relation at higher redshifts ( see zahid et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "work on the _ m - z _ relation dates back to lequeux et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , who found a positive correlation between mass and metallicity that agreed with model predictions for six nearby irregular galaxies . more recently , tremonti et al .  ( 2004 ) found a _",
    "m - z _ relation for @xmath1153,000 nearby ( @xmath3 ) star - forming galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "savaglio et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that this correlation extended to higher redshifts , based on observations of galaxies from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds ; abraham et al .",
    "2004 ) at @xmath12 .",
    "erb et al .  ( 2006 ) measured a monotonic _ m - z _",
    "relation for galaxies at a mean redshift of @xmath13 , and found that this relation was offset from the local _ m - z _",
    "relation by @xmath110.3 dex , with galaxies of a given stellar mass having lower metallicities at higher redshifts .    determining an",
    "_ m - z _ relation for lgrb host galaxies , and comparing this relation to the general galaxy population , is critical",
    ". a clearer understanding of the potential metallicity trend in lgrb hosts is key to determining whether they are potential tracers of star formation in the higher - redshift universe , and the _ m - z _ relation is the best means of isolating the effects of metallicity .",
    "if lgrb hosts are found to consistently lie below the general _ m - z _ relation , this result would suggest that lgrbs do occur preferentially in low - metallicity galaxies .",
    "however , it is important to note that a low - metallicity trend would not entirely preclude the use of lgrbs as tracers of star formation in the high - redshift universe .",
    "the metallicity of the star - forming galaxy population is known to evolve with redshift ; galaxies at @xmath14 1 are less enriched and have lower metallicities on average ( e.g. , kobulnicky & kewley 2004 , shapley et al .",
    "2004 , erb et al .  2006 , chary et al .",
    "2007 , dav & oppenheimer 2007 , liu et al .  2008 ) .",
    "furthermore , the _ m - z _ relation is known to evolve with redshift ( savaglio et al .",
    "based on the suggested cut - off metallicity for @xmath15 lgrb host galaxies ( log(o / h ) + 12 = 8.66 from modjaz et al .  2008 ) ,",
    "kocevski et al .  (",
    "2009 ) derive a redshift - dependent upper limit for the stellar mass of a galaxy that can efficiently produce a lgrb .",
    "they predict that the peak of the grb host stellar mass distribution and the stellar mass where sfr peaks should coincide at @xmath13 , suggesting that at higher redshifts lgrbs may indeed be trace the general star - forming galaxy population ( this equality point moves to lower redshifts with a higher metallicity cutoff ) .",
    "in paper i , we presented the first results of our ongoing uniform rest - frame optical spectroscopic survey of nearby ( @xmath0 ) lgrb host galaxies .",
    "we determined ism properties , including metallicity , star formation rate ( sfr ) , and the age of the young stellar population , for 10 lgrb host galaxies .",
    "this work offered additional strong evidence for a low - metallicity trend in lgrb host galaxies . by comparing the paper i host galaxies to a variety of star - forming galaxy samples from the general population on the ( _ l - z _ ) diagram",
    ", we found that at @xmath3 the metallicity offset between lgrb host galaxies and the general population was significant .",
    "however , at higher redshifts ( @xmath4 ) this offset was less robust .",
    "this comparison would benefit greatly from comparing lgrb host galaxies to the general population using the more fundamental _",
    "m - z _ relation rather than the _ l - z _ relation .    in this paper , we continue our survey of lgrb host galaxies from paper i , detailing the observations and host data taken from the literature ( section 2 ) as well as our means of determining the host interstellar medium ( ism ) properties ( section 3 ) .",
    "we have determined stellar masses for our host galaxies , and use this data to construct a _",
    "m - z _ relation for our lgrb host sample , which we compare to general star - forming galaxy populations ( section 4 ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results and the impact on future work in this area ( section 5 ) . throughout this work",

    "we are conducting a uniform rest - frame optical spectroscopic survey of nearby lgrb host galaxies using the keck telescopes on mauna kea and the magellan telescopes at las campanas observatory .",
    "the sample included in this survey was compiled from the ghosts database ( savaglio et al .",
    "2006 ) and the gamma - ray burst coordinates network .",
    "we restrict our sample to confirmed host galaxies of long - duration ( @xmath20 2 s ) grbs with redshifts of @xmath0 , allowing us to obtain rest - frame optical spectra from 3000 - 7000  using optical and near - infrared observations .",
    "eight galaxies from this ongoing survey were presented in paper i ; observations of four new galaxies , along with additional observations of two hosts from paper i , and data from two new host galaxies in the literature , are included here .",
    "we obtained spectra of 5 lgrb host galaxies using the near infrared spectrograph ( nirspec ) and the low - resolution imaging spectrograph ( lris ) on the keck telescopes at mauna kea .",
    "we observed the host galaxies of grb 980703 , grb 010921 , grb 020819 , and grb 070612a in the rest - frame optical using lris on 18 - 19 november 2009 .",

    "these host galaxies are quite dim ( @xmath24 20 to 25 mag ) . to ensure that we successfully placed such dim targets on the slit",
    ", we first centered on a nearby bright star .",
    "we would then rotate the slit to a position angle that would place both the bright star and the host galaxy on the slit , and nod along the slit to ensure that we observed spectra of both objects .",
    "this approach also allowed the bright spectrum to be used as a trace when extracting the dim host spectrum during data reduction . as a result of this method",
    ", we did not observe the host galaxies at the parallactic angle .",
    "the host galaxy of grb 010921 had been previously observed with lris and published in paper i. we obtained additional lris observations in november of 2009 using the newly updated red side of the lris detector , which offered improved sensitivity in the @xmath209500  regime and made it possible for us to observe the key diagnostic emission features h@xmath21 and [ nii]@xmath226584 ( for which we determine an upper limit ) at the host redshift of @xmath25 .",
    "this allowed us to further refine the metallicity and other ism properties of this host .",

    "levesque et al .  ( 2010b ) suggest that this circumburst extinction could in turn be connected to high metallicity .",

    "while we have demonstrated that _ most _ lgrb host galaxies fall below the _ m - z _ relation for the general galaxy population , we have also noted that the high - metallicity hosts of grb 020819 and grb 050826 do show agreement with the standard _",

    ", the specific explosion site was also found to have a high metallicity , demonstrating that the young progenitor itself evolved in a relatively metal - rich environment rather than a metal - poor pocket of the high - metallicity host and highlighting the importance of understanding the role that higher metallicities may play in the formation of dark bursts . finally , the relativistic sn 2009bb ( soderberg et al .",
    "2010 ) was also found to have a high - metallicity explosion site ( levesque et al .",
