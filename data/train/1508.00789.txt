    "quantum antiferromagnets have provided one of the most fertile grounds for discoveries of new states of matter and testing the theoretical models . the one - dimensional heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain of @xmath6 spins ( 1d - haf ) is probably the most studied example of such quantum antiferromagnets where recent advances in the theoretical approaches@xcite have enabled quantitative discussion of experimental data on model systems . among the best realizations of 1d - hafs are kcuf@xmath9,@xcite sr@xmath1cuo@xmath9,@xcite cuso@xmath10d@xmath1o,@xcite cu(c@xmath11h@xmath11n@xmath1)(no@xmath9)@xmath1,@xcite copper - pyrimidine - dinitrate@xcite and cuse@xmath1o@xmath12.@xcite excellent agreement between the extensive experimental and theoretical work established the existence of gapless @xmath13 excitations , the so called spinons,@xcite into which the conventional @xmath14 magnon excitations fractionalize .",

    "electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) is a resonance technique that has been broadly used to study low - dimensional quantum antiferromagnets.@xcite traditionally , temperature dependence of the shift and linewidth of the epr spectra have been discussed with the spectral moment analysis , i.e. , the so - called kubo - tomita theory.@xcite however , this approach was suggested to be inappropriate in the case of 1d - hafs .",
    "instead , oshikawa and affleck employed the sine - gordon quantum - field theory to circumvent some computational difficulties of the quantum spin state in 1d - hafs and to predict the temperature dependence of the epr linewidth for different magnetic anisotropies.@xcite experimental tests on model systems showed an excellent agreement with this theory.@xcite interestingly , exact low - energy solutions for epr spectra in terms of tll exist in the spin channel only for metallic wires@xcite and are still missing for the case of insulating spin - chain systems .",
    "first epr studies of cso@xmath1 single crystals were reported already back in the 1970 s by knzig,@xcite but clearly the experimental data need to be reinterpreted in light of the new findings .",

    "the powder spectra are well fitted with the uniaxial @xmath42factor anisotropy , i.e. , @xmath43 , convoluted with a lorentzian lineshape broadening whose linewidth also has the uniaxial anisotropy , i.e. , @xmath44 . at @xmath45   k",

    "the exact solutions for the dynamic spin susceptibilities were published only later@xcite and here we take a full advantage of these newly made discoveries to calculate exactly the epr spectrum . given the same starting point for the oshikawa - affleck and the tll approaches , it is thus not surprising that both theories equally well describe the epr spectra in the parameter range relevant for cso@xmath1 .",
    "the most important finding of this work is thus that the temperature dependence of the epr lineshape , the epr linewidth , and the epr signal intensity fully comply with the interpretation of the orbitally - ordered phase of cso@xmath1 in terms of tll framework , with @xmath91 consistently converging to the value close to but yet slightly smaller than @xmath110 .",

    "this discrepancy remains puzzling .",
    "however , since epr and nmr probe the low - energy part of @xmath127 in a slightly different way , the features in the excitation spectrum arising from the effects of interchain couplings may echo differently in epr and nmr data .",
    "the origin of the symmetric anisotropic exchange is unclear at the moment , but most likely it directly reflects the fact that the cs@xmath128 ions , characterized by a significant spin - orbit coupling constant , are bridging the superexchange between nearest neighboring o@xmath26 units along the @xmath18axis .",
    "in conclusion , a systematic analysis of the x - band epr spectra in the low - temperature orbitally - ordered phase of cso@xmath1 agrees with the proposed 1d - haf state . using either the oshikawa - affleck or the tll theoretical frameworks , we find a systematic agreement with the experimental epr lineshape , linewidth and signal intensity , thus allowing us a quantitative determination of the anisotropy of the symmetric exchange interaction or , alternatively , of the tll exponent . therefore",
