    "<S> we find that in most of the single fields inflationary models the mean square gauge invariant inflaton fluctuation grows _ </S>",

    "<S> hybrid inflationary models can be an exception : the mean square of a test field can dominate over the gauge invariant inflaton fluctuation one on suitably chosen parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the stochastic growth of quantum fluctuations of a second field , relaxing the assumption of its zero homogeneous value , in a generic inflationary model ; as a main result , we obtain that the equation of motion of a gauge invariant variable associated , order by order , with a generic quantum scalar fluctuation during inflation can be obtained only if we use the number of e - folds as the time variable in the corresponding langevin and fokker - planck equations for the stochastic approach . </S>",
    "<S> we employ this approach to derive some bounds for the case of a model with two massive fields . </S>"
