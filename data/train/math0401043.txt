    "* that function ( 1 ) satisfies ( 2 ) may be seen by inspection of @xmath15 - @xmath16 : @xmath17 + thus @xmath18 only if all the divisors @xmath19 of @xmath13 give non - zero remaninders , which is the definition of primality . *",
    "what constitutes a `` useful function '' @xmath0 is partly subjective [ 1 ] , so we describe our @xmath0 as : simple , compact , transparent , and using only two basic notions ( _ floor _ @xmath20 ) and ( _ ceiling _",
