    "an important aspect of strongly - correlated electron physics is the expectation that some systems may exhibit novel non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "this can present some interesting challenges for theoretical models since non - fermi liquid behavior is known to be rare based on simple renormalization group ( rg ) arguments@xcite .",
    "the best understood example is the luttinger liquid in one spatial dimension , where the non - fermi liquid behavior is essentially attributed to the fact that quartic interactions of dirac fermions are marginal in the rg sense . in higher dimensions quartic interactions of dirac fermions are irrelevant .",
    "these considerations were one of the primary initial motivations for the construction and analysis of a new model of interacting fermions@xcite with non - fermi liquid behavior . like the luttinger liquid",
    ", the model is a continuum field theory of only 4 fermionic fields @xmath7 which carry charge and spin , with a unique quartic interaction due to fermi statistics .",
    "the novelty of the model is the free kinetic term in the hamiltonian which in addition the commonplace term that is second order in spatial derivatives @xmath8 , contains an additional contribution that is second order in time derivatives @xmath9 , and thus has an emergent lorentz symmetry",
    ". the model can be consistently canonically quantized as a fermion , even though this structure of the kinetic term is usually associated with relativistic bosons . in two spatial dimensions",
    "the field @xmath10 has dimension @xmath11 , which implies the quartic interaction has dimension @xmath12 and is thus rg relevant .",
    "the model in fact has a low - energy fixed point , i.e. quantum critical point .",
    "several interesting properties in addition to the non - fermi liquid behavior emerged in the analysis of the model@xcite .",
    "it has a hidden @xmath13 symmetry which contains the spin @xmath14 and electric @xmath15 as commuting subgroups .",
    "the fundamental fields @xmath16 transform in the 4-dimensional spinor representation of @xmath13 and the bilinears decompose as @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath18 vector representation serves as order parameters for the spontaneous symmetry breaking of @xmath14 , i.e. magnetic order , and also contains cooper pair fields of charge @xmath19 which are order parameters for symmetry breaking of @xmath15 , i.e. superconductivity . by deriving separate gap equations and studying their solutions",
    "it was shown that the model can contain an anti - ferromagnetic phase ( af ) and a d - wave superconducting phase ( sc ) . in this model the basic mechanism that leads to a d - wave sc instability is clearly identified as arising from the 1-loop scattering of cooper pairs .",
    "an attractive feature of the model is its simplicity , reflected in the fact that it has very few free parameters : an overall energy scale @xmath20 set by the high - energy cutoff @xmath21 , a fermi velocity @xmath22 , and a single coupling @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore , at low energies @xmath23 is near the low - energy fixed point value of @xmath24 , so that perturbation theory can be reliable .",
    "the above features led us to propose this theory as a toy model of high temperature superconductivity ( htsc ) . here",
    "the @xmath13 symmetry is quite different from the @xmath13 symmetry of zhang in this context@xcite : whereas he postulates an @xmath13 invariant landau - ginsburg theory for the bosonic spin and electric order parameters , our model is a microscopic model of fermions where the bosonic order parameters are composite bilinears in the fermions .",
    "the @xmath13 symmetry was not put in by hand in our model , rather it is accidental and hidden .",
    "in fact , the af and d - wave sc phases are _ not _ related by the @xmath13 in our model . in principle",
    "a landau - ginsburg effective theory can be derived from our model , but like the bcs theory , our underlying microscopic theory is more powerful for deriving gap equations , critical temperatures , etc .",
    "arguments that motivate its application to htsc were given in @xcite , the best one being its relation to the non - linear @xmath25 sigma model effective theory for the @xmath26 heisenberg model description of the af phase , which is also a relativistic theory ; however a rigorous derivation of it from say the hubbard model on the lattice is lacking .",
    "if our model really turns out to correctly capture some essential features of htsc , then it should be viewed as an effective low - energy theory for wavelengths that are long compared to the lattice spacing .",
    "one expects that such a description can be approximately described by a rotationally invariant quantum field theory describing the gas of quasi - particles that sc condenses out of .",
    "the shortcoming of such a theory is that lattice effects , such as features that are dependent on the detailed structure of the fermi surface in the brillouin zone , are necessarily absent in the basic model , although perhaps they can be incorporated with small perturbations of the hamiltonian .",
    "furthermore , our model does not have an explicit fermi surface , as for the @xmath25 sigma model of the af phase at half - filling .",
    "nevertheless , the existence of a simple model of fermions with only repulsive quartic interactions that possesses the all of the main motifs of htsc , which is to say it has clearly identified mechanisms for the d - wave sc , the pseudogap , and anti - ferromagnetism , can be useful for deciding which properties are essential and which are superfluous for the phenomenon .",
    "thus , although it has not been established that our model captures what is really happening in htsc , for the remainder of this paper we will take the liberty to borrow the terminology of the htsc literature where appropriate .",
    "the main purpose of the present article is study in detail the origin and properties of the so - called pseudogap in our model . in the htsc materials",
    ", the pseudogap refers to an energy scale @xmath27 where a cross - over behavior is observed in a variety of physical properties such as electronic specific heat , magnetic susceptibility and conductivity .",
    "the same energy scale can be observed as the onset of a depression in the density of states . in the underdoped region , @xmath28 is considerably larger than the superconducting @xmath3 . for reviews",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the origin and physical interpretation of the pseudogap remains a fundamental question in the physics of htsc , and many researchers feel that a proper understanding of it will be an important key toward unraveling the mysteries of htsc .",
    "two broad classes of theories can be summarized by the schematic phase diagrams shown in figure [ figure1 ] . in the scenario on the left",
    ", @xmath28 goes to zero inside the sc dome , perhaps terminating at a quantum critical point . in this class of theories",
    "the pseudogap is unrelated , and in fact competes with , superconductivity . in the second class of theories ,",
    "the pseudogap indicates pre - formed cooper pairs for example , i.e. is a friendly precursor to sc , and the pseudogap line merges with @xmath3 on the overdoped side .",
    "these opposing scenarios are discussed in some detail in @xcite .",
    "thermodynamic data such as specific heat favors the first scenario@xcite , whereas spectroscopic data seems to support the second@xcite .",
    "[ figure1 ]    in our model there is an obvious identification of the pseudogap : whereas af or sc order are related to the order parameters in the @xmath18 vector of @xmath13 , the pseudogap is naturally associated with the singlet bilinear in the tensor product of @xmath29 , as suggested by tye@xcite , and also more tentatively in @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the operator @xmath30 .",
    "whereas this term is classically zero in the relation with the @xmath25 sigma model , it is dynamically generated in the presence of interactions . as a contribution to the hamiltonian , it corresponds to a relativistic mass @xmath0 , and the 1-particle states have energy @xmath31 .",
    "thus a non - zero mass @xmath0 gives a clean gap in the density of states , i.e. there is nothing `` pseudo '' about it .",
    "as discussed above , the anisotropy of the observed pseudogap is not a feature of this mass - gap since it is a lattice effect ( `` fermi arcs '' ) . in the sequel",
    "we identify this mass with the pseudogap energy scale @xmath32 and will show that its properties closely parallel the phenomenology of the pseudogap in htsc , at least on the underdoped side .",
    "the pseudogap has an entirely different origin than the sc gap in our model , essentially because it corresponds to a dynamically generated vacuum expectation value @xmath33 which preserves the @xmath13 symmetry whereas sc breaks the electric @xmath15 subgroup .",
    "it is an intrinsic property of the normal state density of states . whether it competes with or aids superconductivity",
    "is straightforwardly addressed by incorporating it into the d - wave gap equation derived in @xcite .",
    "as we will see , it clearly competes with superconductivity since if it is too large it destroys the solution to the sc gap equation .",
    "fortunately , the pseudogap goes to zero at the critical point and this makes superconductivity possible ; in fact sc is enhanced near the critical point .",
    "thus our model is in the class of the left figure in figure [ figure1 ] , with @xmath28 terminating at a quantum critical point near optimal doping .",
    "( the proper treatment of temperature presented in this paper led to the identification of the critical point which differs from the original proposal in @xcite . )    our analysis of the pseudogap required two technical improvements of the work presented in @xcite .",
    "in the latter work , temperature was treated crudely as a mass , the idea being that temperature and a mass can both be viewed as an infra - red cutoff ; this is ultimately unreliable for the computation of thermodynamic properties . in the present work ,",
    "since the mass is identified with the pseudogap which is a zero temperature property , temperature must be dealt with properly , and this is accomplished with the matsubara formalism .",
    "a non - zero mass also resolves some infra - red divergences that were present in the previous treatment .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows . in the next section we review the definition of the model and some of its basic properties .",
    "section iii addresses the unitarity of the model , beyond what is contained in our previous work .",
    "section iv describes our rg prescriptions . in section",
    "v we analyze the dynamical generation of a mass , i.e. pseudogap , by deriving a gap equation for the vacuum expectation value @xmath34 .",
    "the pseudogap depends on the variable @xmath35 which up to a scale is the inverse coupling . in section",
    "vi we propose a relation between the variable @xmath35 and hole doping which thus gives the doping dependence of the pseudogap . in section vii",
    "we compute the effect of the pseudogap on the electronic specific heat .",
    "a non - zero magnetic field is introduced in section viii , and we compute the temperature dependent spin susceptibility and the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat . for all of these thermodynamic properties ,",
    "we find crossover behavior at the temperature @xmath36 and its qualitative dependence on doping compares favorably with data . finally in section ix",
    "we derive the finite temperature version of the d - wave gap equation and incorporate the effect of the pseudogap into it .",
    "analysis of this equation clearly shows that the pseudogap competes with sc , and leads to a computation of the superconducting @xmath3 .",
    "as for any second - quantized description of electrons with spin @xmath37 , the fundamental fields of the model are 4 fermionic fields @xmath38 , where the flavor index @xmath39 corresponds to spin and @xmath40 is electric charge . due to the fermionic statistics there is a unique quartic interaction , thus various models are primarily characterized by the free kinetic term .",
    "our model in two spatial dimenions is [ ham ] h = d^2 @xmath41 the above hamiltonian would be a standard second - quantized field theory for fermions interacting via a delta - function potential if it were nt for the term that is second order in time derivatives , and this is the primary novelty of the model .",
    "this choice of kinetic term can be motivated from the phenomenology of htsc , since it leads to the correct temperature dependence of the specific heat @xmath42 at low temperatures ( see sectin vii ) in the abscence of superconductivity , which is characteristic of a relativistic theory , and the mass @xmath0 can correspond to the pseudogap .    as a model of htsc , the above kinetic term can also be motivated as follows@xcite .",
    "suppose one is near the mott - hubbard insulating phase .",
    "the anti - ferromagnetic phase of the heisenberg model has an effective low energy description in terms of a spin 3-vector field @xmath43 constrained to be of fixed length @xmath44 , with lagrangian @xmath45@xcite .",
    "the field @xmath43 is bilinear in the fundamental electron fields , and in our model corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "the constraint on @xmath43 can be imposed by the constraint @xmath47 since [ 1.1b ] = - @xmath48 ^ 2 imposing these constraints one finds that [ 1.1c ] _ _    _ ^- _ ^+   + irrelevant   operators which justifies the kinetic term in our model .",
    "one can then relax the constraint on @xmath49 , and replacing it with a `` soft constraint '' by including a quartic interaction , as is done for the non - linear @xmath25 sigma model in two spatial dimensions .",
    "another motivation for the kinetic term in our model ( at @xmath50 ) was given in @xcite based on the linear dispersion relation @xmath51 one obtains when expanding around a circular fermi surface .",
    "however this involved a modification of , or at best a crude approximation to , the density of states .",
    "canonical quantization and also a path - integral formulation follow from the euclidean action : [ 1.1 ] s = d^2 dt @xmath52 - 8 ^2 g ^-_^+_^-_^+ _ where @xmath53 .",
    "the velocity @xmath22 plays the role of the speed of light , and it was proposed in @xcite that it be identified with the universal nodal fermi velocity@xcite . in the sequel we set @xmath54 except where indicated .",
    "note that the fields @xmath10 are treated as lorentz scalars and spin is simply a flavor .",
    "however it is possible to treat the fields as dirac spinors and thereby achieve complete lorentz invariance@xcite .",
    "the quartic term is unique up to the sign of the coupling by fermionic statistics , and positive @xmath23 corresponds to repulsive interactions .",
    "a consequence of the fermionic statistics is that the model has a hidden @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the appearance of this @xmath13 is quite different from the @xmath13 symmetry proposed by zhang .",
    "this symmetry is manifest if one considers an @xmath55-component version with fields @xmath38 , @xmath56 , which has @xmath57 symmetry ( hence the terminology `` symplectic fermions '' ) . for @xmath58 , since there are 4 fermionic fields and consequently a unique 4-fermion interaction , the theory automatically has @xmath59 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath13 contains @xmath14 and @xmath15 subgroups which commute and can be identified with spin and electric charge respectively .",
    "the conserved electric current then corresponds to [ current ] j^e_= -i _ @xmath60 and the fields @xmath61 have electric charge @xmath62 .",
    "the important order parameters for the study of spontaneous symmetry breaking are composite bilinears in the fermions .",
    "the 4 fields @xmath38 transform under the spinor representation of @xmath13 .",
    "the bilinears can be decomposed as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the singlet , @xmath18 the vector representation , and @xmath65 the adjoint .",
    "the singlet is the field @xmath66 and corresponds to the mass term in the action .",
    "the @xmath18-vector of fields corresponds to [ 1.2 ] = ( , ^+_e , ^-_e ) = ( ^- ^+ , ^+_^+ _ , ^-_^- _ ) where @xmath67 are pauli matrices .",
    "the triplet of fields @xmath43 are electrically neutral and transform as a spin vector under the @xmath14 and serve as magnetic order parameters .",
    "the fields @xmath68 on the other hand are spin singlets but carry electric charge @xmath19 and are thus cooper pair fields for superconducting order .",
    "the @xmath13 invariant product is [ 1.3 ] = - 2 ^+_e ^-_e and the interaction can be expressed in the manifestly @xmath13 invariant manner : [ 1.4 ] _",
    "int = g    the momentum expansion of the free fields is [ momexp ] ^- ( , t ) & = & @xmath69 + ^+ ( , t ) & = & @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the canonical quantization of the theory based on the lagrangian leads to the canonical anti - commutations in momentum space : [ aadag ] \\ { a _ , a^_ } = \\ { b _ , b^_ } = ( 2 ) ^2 ( -  ) and the hamiltonian is [ hamilton ] h_free = _ = , _ @xmath73 the @xmath74 and @xmath75 particles have opposite electric charge and can thus be thought of as particles and holes .",
    "a distinguishing feature of our model , in contrast to quartic interactions of dirac fermions for instance , is that the quartic interaction is relevant in the renormalization group ( rg ) sense : the field @xmath10 has classical mass dimension @xmath11 so that the quartic interaction has dimension @xmath12 and the coupling @xmath23 dimension 1 .",
    "this means that the interactions are important at low energies and can lead to non - fermi liquid behavior .",
    "in fact , the model has a low energy rg fixed point , i.e. a quantum critical point at @xmath76 .",
    "this critical point can formally be understood as an analytic continuation of the familiar wilson - fisher fixed point of the @xmath77 models , where @xmath78 , and some critical exponents , such as the anomalous dimension of the field @xmath10 , can be computed by specializing the known epsilon - expansion results for the @xmath77 model to @xmath78@xcite . however , many of the important operators such as the order parameters @xmath79 are composite fermion bilinears , which changes their structure compared to the magnetic order parameters of the @xmath77 models .",
    "furthermore , @xmath79 includes bilinear order parameters of charge @xmath19 that have no counterpart in @xmath77 physics .",
    "these rg properties are summarized in the next section .    another interesting feature of our model is that whereas the fundamental interaction is repulsive , when one incorporates the momentum - dependent scattering at second order in perturbation theory ( 1-loop ) there is an instability toward the formation of a d - wave superconducting ground state .",
    "this was studied in @xcite by deriving a d - wave gap equation for momentum - dependent vacuum expectation values for the cooper - pair fields @xmath68 .",
    "this is reviewed briefly in section ix where we derive and study the finite temperature version of the d - wave gap equation .",
    "the above free hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) in momentum space is obviously hermitian and defines a unitary theory , in spite of the fact that the klein - gordon type of action normally associated with free bosons was quantized with the `` wrong '' statistics , i.e. as a fermion .",
    "there are no negative norm states in the fock space of @xmath80 particles since there are no unwanted minus signs in eq .",
    "( [ aadag ] ) . in @xmath81",
    "the free massless symplectic fermion model is normally considered a non - unitary @xmath82 conformal field theory . the resolution of this apparent contradiction can be found in @xcite , where it was shown that the symplectic fermion can be mapped onto the @xmath83 unitary theory@xcite of dirac fermions at the level of detailed conformal partition functions . in light of the above results , the latter fact is not surprising since in momentum space the hamiltonians of symplectic and dirac fermions are identically eq . ( [ hamilton ] ) .",
    "the issue of unitarity was further addressed in @xcite , where the main concern is the consistency of the interacting theory . because of the extra minus sign in ( [ momexp ] ) , the fields @xmath61 are not hermitian conjugates of each other , but rather [ unit.1 ] ^+ = c ( ^-)^c where the unitary operator @xmath84 simply distinguishes particles and holes : @xmath85 and @xmath86 , with @xmath87 .",
    "the operator @xmath84 is easily constructed : [ ccons ] c = @xmath88 the interacting theory is thus pseudo - hermitian : @xmath89 .",
    "the free theory is actually hermitian in momentum space since it is quadratic in @xmath75 s . as before there are no negative norm states in the fock space .",
    "a pseudo - hermitian hamiltonian has real energy eigenvalues , and can still lead to a unitary time evolution , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "let us make the following additional remarks concerning this issue in this specific context .",
    "a unitary time evolution follows if one modifies the definition of hermitian conjugation .",
    "define the @xmath84-hermitian conjugate as @xmath90 .",
    "then the s - matrix is unitary with respect to this conjugation : @xmath91 since @xmath92 .",
    "however the @xmath84-conjugate hermitian conjugation implies a modified definition of the inner product : @xmath93 . under this new inner product , states with an odd number of @xmath75 particles",
    "now have negative norm . a completely equivalent description that dispenses altogether with the operator @xmath84 amounts to removing the minus sign in the expansion of @xmath94 in eq . ( [ momexp ] ) .",
    "this gives a hermitian hamiltonian since now @xmath95 .",
    "however this also gives the modified relation @xmath96 and this leads to the same conclusion that the @xmath75 particle sector contains negative norm states .",
    "we now argue that this model can still yield a consistent theory at _",
    "low energy_. let us use the description based on the @xmath84-operator ; the same arguments apply to the manifestly hermitian description without it .",
    "the probability that an initial state @xmath97 evolves to a final state @xmath98 is given by [ prob ] p_if = states can be classified according to their @xmath84 eigenvalue of @xmath99 , where @xmath100 corresponds to negative norm .",
    "one sees from the above formula that the probability @xmath101 is positive so long as the states @xmath102 are both of either positive or negative norm .",
    "the problematic transitions with negative probability thus arise if the matrix element @xmath103 is non - zero for states of mixed norm .",
    "however at low energies compared to the mass @xmath0 , these transitions are forbidden as a result of energy and charge conservation .",
    "for example , suppose the initial state consists of only @xmath74-particles .",
    "because of charge conservation , processes that change the number of @xmath75 particles necessarily involve creation of @xmath104 pairs ; for instance @xmath105 is not allowed .",
    "the process @xmath106 is consistent with charge conservation , but not allowed kinematically , so one needs to consider at least @xmath107 .",
    "energy conservation shows that the energy of the initial @xmath74 particles must be at least @xmath108 in order for the process to be kinematically allowed .",
    "thus at low energies compared to the mass @xmath0 no @xmath75-particles will be produced from a state containing only @xmath74 particles .",
    "a variation of this viewpoint interchanges the role of @xmath75 and @xmath109 , so that particles are created by the @xmath75 s and have negative energy .",
    "one can now imagine that all the negative energy states are filled according to the pauli principle .",
    "since there is a gap of @xmath108 between the negative and positive energy states , at low energies compared to @xmath0 no @xmath110 pairs will be created out of the dirac sea and one can deal only with the @xmath74-particles .    as we describe in the sequel ,",
    "the mass @xmath0 is on the order of the cut - off and can be quite large , typically greater than @xmath111 for htsc materials , so the low energy approximation is expected to be good for a large range of temperatures . at very high temperatures ,",
    "our model necessarily breaks down and must be replaced by another effective theory that restores unitarity .",
    "for instance , the cross - over to ordinary fermi liquid behavior in for example the specific heat is not built into the model .    another way to obtain",
    "a low energy unitary theory involves the introduction of a chemical potential , which is necessary at finite density .",
    "particle number is not conserved here ; instead a chemical potential couples to the electric charge @xmath112 , i.e. @xmath113 .",
    "the free hamiltonian is then [ hmu ] h = @xmath114 because of the difference in electric charge between the @xmath74 and @xmath75 particles , at a given @xmath115 there is a gap of @xmath116 between the energies of the @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s .",
    "let us suppose that @xmath117 is chosen so that all of the @xmath75-states are filled . typically @xmath117 will be comparable to the fermi energy and typically very large . if @xmath117 is large enough , then because of the energy gap @xmath116 at low energies we can effectively deal only with the @xmath74-particle sector .",
    "alternatively , one can view the @xmath74 sector as an in - accessible high energy sector when @xmath117 is large enough , and deal only with the low - energy @xmath75 sector . either way , as discussed above , all probabilities @xmath101 will be positive .",
    "in all approaches to the renormalization group there are two cut - offs , a fixed upper cut - off @xmath21 typically related to the inverse lattice spacing , and a lower cut - off @xmath118 which is the running rg scale .",
    "renormalization effectively removes the degrees of freedom with energy between @xmath119 and @xmath21 . in the high - energy physics context ,",
    "the cut - off @xmath21 is unknown , so one normally performs the renormalization by sending @xmath21 to infinity and incorporating counter - terms to cancel ultra - violet divergences . in @xmath120 spacetime dimensions",
    "this can be conveniently and systematically performed by using dimensional regularization in @xmath121 dimensions , which leads to the epsilon - expansion technique for studying models in @xmath122 . in the present context , since the cut - off @xmath21 is in principle known and physical quantities depend on it , it is more appropriate to perform the rg directly in @xmath122 with explicit cut - offs rather than use the epsilon expansion",
    ".    the dependence of the couplings on the running rg scale @xmath119 can be determined by considering an upper cut - off @xmath119 only .",
    "consider first the coupling constant @xmath23 .",
    "the 1-loop correction to the vertex is cancelled by a shift of @xmath23 , i.e. by defining @xmath123 where [ 2.2 ] g = 16 ^2 g^2 ^ when @xmath124 , @xmath125 . thus [ 2.3 ] _",
