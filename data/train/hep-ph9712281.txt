    "soudan-2 is a fine - grained iron tracking calorimeter located 2100 mwe underground in soudan , minnesota , usa . the experiment has been taking data since 1989 when the detector was one quarter of its full size ; the construction was completed at the end of 1993 .",
    "the experiment continues to take data with 90% live time , having accumulated 3.6 kty up to the date of this conference .",
    "the first result on the ratio of ratios of the atmospheric neutrinos , @xmath2_{data } }   \\over{[(\\nu_\\mu+\\bar\\nu_\\mu)/(\\nu_e+\\bar\\nu_e)]_{mc } } } \\label{eq : r}\\ ] ] was published earlier this year.@xcite",
    "the two main components of the soudan-2 apparatus are the central detector and the active shield . the _ central detector _",
    "consists of 224 @xmath3 m calorimeter modules weighing 4.3 tons each .",
    "the bulk of the mass consists of 1.6-mm - thick corrugated steel sheets which are interleaved with drift tubes .",
    "each half of a 1.5-cm - diam .",
    ", 1-m - long , resistive drift tube is read out by a crossed pair of a vertical anode wire and a horizontal cathode pad that determine two coordinates of a tube crossing ; the third coordinate is deduced from the drift time . readout from the 3.4 million half - tubes is accomplished using 136,000 anode and cathode channels that are multiplexed before the signals are digitized .",
    "the _ active shield _ covers the walls of the soudan-2 cavern enclosing the central detector as hermetically as possible . only the calorimeter s support columns must pass through the shield , adding up to about 5 m@xmath4 , out of the total shield area of 1700 m@xmath4 .",
    "the shield consists of 1529 modules with a typical size of 19 cm @xmath5 7 m , each containing a double layer of proportional tubes with a digital readout .",
    "a coincidence of two adjacent layers is required for a hit in the off - line analysis .",
    "detailed descriptions have been published of the design and performance of soudan-2 calorimeter modules @xcite , and of the active shield system @xcite .",
    "the contained events ( cev ) in an underground detector are expected to be atmospheric neutrino interactions , where the neutrinos originate in decays of mesons and muons in cosmic ray showers in the atmosphere .",
    "it is these interactions that we model in our monte carlo simulation and compare with data .",
    "we use the bartol atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite , and every mc event is overlayed onto a random pulser event to acquire a realistic noise pattern . in the following , we used simulated events corresponding to an 18.3 kty exposure of soudan-2 ; the dependence of the neutrino flux on the solar cycle was taken into account .    during the period april 1989 through december 1996 , we analyzed 75 million triggers , most of which are initiated by throughgoing muons or  noise \" ( both electronic noise and triggers due to local radioactivity in the cavern ) .",
    "75% of the monte carlo events pass the hardware trigger requirement .",
    "all triggers are processed by a two - stage software filter .",
    "the software performs a number of data quality checks , and rejects events that conform to one of the identified noise patterns . to check for event containment",
    ", the software requires that _ ( i ) _ no part of the event is within 20 cm of the detector surface , and that _ ( ii ) _ no track is located and oriented in such a way that it could enter the calorimeter undetected ( e.g. through a crack between modules ) .",
    "the number of events satisfying the software requirements is 15,000 per kty .",
    "about 50% of monte carlo events that satisfy the trigger conditions pass the software filter .",
    "the last step in the data reduction chain is a two - stage physicist scan .",
    "the resulting cev sample contains typically 500 events per kty , representing an overall data reduction of @xmath6 .",
    "the monte carlo events are injected into the data stream before the scanning stage so that physicists scan data and mc simultaneously without knowing which is which . of the remaining monte",
    "carlo events , 70% pass the scan requirements , indicating an overall neutrino cev detection efficiency of about 26% .         in order to measure the @xmath7 flavor composition in as unbiased a way as possible",
    ", it is customary to use a  ratio of ratios \" .",
    "we express @xmath8 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : r ] using our number of tracks , @xmath9 , as a measure of @xmath10 events , and number of showers , @xmath11 , as a measure of @xmath12 events : @xmath13 before the background correction , we obtain @xmath14 using the raw gold sample counts . using the corrected numbers of neutrino events in our gold sample from table 2 , we obtain @xmath15 where the first error is statistical , and the second is systematic .",
    "our value of @xmath8 is consistent with results of underground water detectors reviewed in ref .",
    "the indication is that there are too few single tracks , i.e. too few @xmath10 and @xmath16 events in the underground neutrino flux , usually explained as due to neutrino oscillations .    finally , we present lepton energy distributions for our track sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_t ] and for our shower sample in fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_s ] . in the upper portion of the figures ,",
    "the crosses represent our gold data before any correction , and the solid histogram shows the rock background .",
    "the dashed histograms are the monte carlo distributions . in the lower portion of the figures",
    "we show our corrected data distributions .",
    "we note that the background is confined not only to smaller penetration depths , but also to smaller energies than the neutrino event distributions",
