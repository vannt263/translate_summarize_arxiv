    "more precisely , if two fronts of generation @xmath362 and @xmath361 collide , at most two waves will retain their generation .",
    "if @xmath372 , then the remaining waves will be removed ; however , if @xmath373 , we use the original ( approximate ) solution .",
    "when we remove the fronts , we let the function @xmath374 be equal to the value that has to be the lower of the removed fronts , provided that the removed fronts are not the upmost fronts in the solution of the riemann problem .",

    "we remark that this process of removing ( very ) weak waves in approximate riemann solver in our construction of approximate solutions will not influence the uniform estimates we obtained in  3.23.3 .",

    "we will show that there exists only a finite number of fronts of generation less than or equal to @xmath364 and that , for a fixed @xmath186 , there is only a finite number of collisions / reflections .    for this , as we know that @xmath375 , then the strength of each individual front is bounded by @xmath376 . for later reference",

    "note that , by the construction of the approximate riemann problem , the strength of each split rarefaction front is at least @xmath379 .",
    "given that @xmath380 is uniformly bounded , we find @xmath381    thus , the number of first - generation fronts is finite .",
    "this also means that there will be only a finite number of collisions / reflections between first - generation fronts and free boundary . to see this ,",
    "note first having the assumption of strict hyperbolicity would have implied that each wave family will have speeds that are distinct .",

    "hence , we can still conclude that each first - generation front will remain in a wedge in the @xmath384plane determined by the slowest and fastest speeds of that family .",
    "eventually , all first - generation fronts will have interacted at most finite times , and we can also conclude that there can be only a finite number of collisions between first - generation fronts and free boundary globally , since once a front is reflected , it will never meet the free boundary again .",

    "then , in analogy to , we find @xmath388 consequently , the number of fronts of generation less than or equal to @xmath361 is finite .",
    "we can now repeat the arguments above showing that there is only a finite number of collisions between the first - generation fronts ( and reflections off free boundary ) , just replacing `` first generation '' by `` of generation less than or equal to @xmath361 '' and show that there is only a finite number of collisions producing the fronts of generation of @xmath389 .",

    "<S> for a two - dimensional steady supersonic euler flow past a convex cornered wall with right angle , a characteristic discontinuity ( vortex sheet and/or entropy wave ) is generated , which separates the supersonic flow from the gas at rest ( hence subsonic ) . </S>",
    "<S> we proved that such a transonic characteristic discontinuity is structurally stable under small perturbations of the upstream supersonic flow in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a weak entropy solution and lipschitz continuous free boundary ( i.e. characteristic discontinuity ) is established . to achieve this , </S>",
    "<S> the problem is formulated as a free boundary problem for a nonstrictly hyperbolic system of conservation laws ; and the free boundary problem is then solved by analyzing nonlinear wave interactions and employing the front tracking method . </S>"
