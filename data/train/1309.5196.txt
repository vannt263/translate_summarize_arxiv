    "the equations for standard liquids and gases are well established as the hydrodynamic equations of mass , momentum , and energy density fields , and heat conduction and sound propagation in solids are also well established @xcite .",
    "the validity of the description was carefully investigated in small - scale experiments @xcite , which suggested that the behavior near a solid wall shows deviations from calculation results based on the standard hydrodynamic equations .",
    "furthermore , a stimulating prediction that a liquid droplet is nucleated in a sheared solid may be another example that is not described by the established continuum equations @xcite .    in these examples ,",
    "nontrivial phenomena occur at the interface between a solid and a fluid .",
    "indeed , the description of behavior near the interface has not been established , because its characteristic length scale is too small for macroscopic phenomenological descriptions .",
    "although imposing appropriate boundary conditions at the interface for macroscopic equations often gives a good description , there are cases where the assumptions of the boundary conditions should be seriously considered . in this paper , we study a phenomenon associated with temperature gaps at the interfaces between a solid and gases .    in order to demonstrate our findings clearly",
    ", we employ the special - purpose systems shown in fig .",
    "a solid ( say , silicon ) , which consists of many atoms , is placed in a long tube of cross - sectional area @xmath0 .",
    "dilute gases ( say , helium ) at the same pressure @xmath1 but different temperatures @xmath2 and @xmath3 are contained in the left and right regions , respectively , at an initial time .",
    "the gases are well approximated by ideal gases and can not mix with each other because the solid acts as a separating wall .",
    "it is assumed that the pressure and temperatures of gas particles before colliding with the solid are kept constant over time . in this setup , despite the equal pressure , momentum flows from one gas to the other owing to the energy transfer from the hot side to the cold side .",
    "recently , a phenomenological mechanism for the emergence of a force from such cross - coupling has been proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide a quantitative estimation of the force acting on the solid on the basis of a microscopic description of the system under some assumptions .",
    "an important finding is that the force is determined by the temperature gaps at the interface of the solid and gases .",
    "more precisely , we denote by @xmath4 and @xmath5 the kinetic temperatures of the solid particles at the left and right ends , respectively , which are different from @xmath2 and @xmath3 in general . such a temperature discontinuity at an interface has been measured in experiments @xcite . for the mass of gas particles @xmath6 and the mass of solid particles @xmath7 , we define @xmath8 , which is assumed to be small .",
    "we then show that the temperature gaps @xmath9 and @xmath10 generate the force @xmath11 given by @xmath12 by assuming fourier s law in the solid , we can estimate the temperature gaps in terms of the thermal conductivity of the solid .",
    "surprisingly , the result shows that @xmath11 takes a macroscopically measurable value .",
    "it should be noted that steady - state motion of the solid is observed because the force @xmath11 may be balanced with a friction force induced by collision with gas particles .    in the argument below , we describe the microscopic model that we employ .",
    "we then derive the aforementioned result .",
    "finally , we discuss the possibility of experimental realization of the phenomenon in laboratories . throughout the paper , @xmath13 represents the inverse temperature and @xmath14 the boltzmann constant .",
    "the subscripts or superscripts @xmath15 and @xmath16 represent quantities on the left and right sides , respectively .",
    "we provide a three - dimensional mechanical description of the solid in fig .",

    "we assume that the solid consists of @xmath18 particles of mass @xmath7 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the number of particles along the @xmath17 direction and in a plane perpendicular to the @xmath17 axis , respectively .",
    "a collection of the positions and momenta of @xmath18 solid particles , which we distinguish by subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , are denoted by @xmath25 , which gives the microscopic state of the solid .",

    "the hamiltonian of the solid , @xmath33 , is given by @xmath34 + \\hspace{-3 mm } \\sum_{{\\ensuremath{\\left\\langlei , j;i',j'\\right\\rangle } } } \\hspace{-2 mm } u_{\\rm int}(\\bm{r}_{i , j},\\bm{r}_{i',j ' } ) , \\label{eq : hamiltonian}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 represents the nearest- and second - nearest - neighbor pair of solid particles .",
    "@xmath36 is the interaction potential between two solid particles , and @xmath37 is the potential between a solid particle and the tube wall .",
    "the tube wall is assumed to be frictionless , and @xmath38 does not depend on @xmath28 .",
    "the motion of solid particles except for left and right ends is described by the hamiltonian equations .",
    "next , we provide an effective description of the gases .",
    "we focus on the gas on the left side ; the gas on the right side can be described similarly . employing a dilute gas that consists of particles of mass @xmath6",
    ", we may assume that the characteristic time of the dissipation process inside each gas is much longer than the time during which we observe the steady - state motion of the solid . therefore , gas particles that have yet to collide with the solid are in equilibrium at the temperature @xmath2 , the pressure @xmath1 , and the number density @xmath39 .",
    "we also assume that gas particles elastically and instantaneously collide with the solid only once .",
    "more precisely , the instantaneous collision means that the characteristic time of the solid - gas interaction is much shorter than the relaxation time of all solid particles .",
    "it should be noted that this situation is completely different from a case where the solid is effectively described as a wall with one degree of freedom . for convenience ,",
    "we make a list of characteristic time scales in table  [ tab : time_scales ] .",
    "our assumption means that @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , for simplicity , we assume that the tangent plane at the collision point is perpendicular to the @xmath17 axis , so that the @xmath17 component of the velocity of each solid particle at both ends is independent of the other components at the collisions .",
    ".[tab : time_scales ] characteristic time scales . [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     for this setup",
    ", the interaction between the solid and the gas on the left side can be described by random collisions with the collision rate @xmath41 per unit area for the gas particle velocity @xmath42 and the solid particle velocity @xmath43 .",
    "the collision rate is explicitly written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the heaviside step function and @xmath46 is the maxwell  boltzmann distribution .",
    "the @xmath47-th collision time of a gas particle and the @xmath22-th solid particle at the left end is determined according to the poisson process .",

    "the equation of motion for the @xmath22-th solid particle in the @xmath17 direction is written as @xmath50 with @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the force exerted by the elastic collisions of the gas particles , @xmath53 the impulse of the collision , and @xmath54 the velocity just before the collision when @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , the collision rate of the gas on the right side is given by @xmath55 , and the equation of motion for the solid particles at the right end is determined as well .",
    "the hamiltonian equations in combination with the poisson processes yield a unique steady state .",
    "the expectation value in the steady state is denoted by @xmath56 .",

    "thus , the total force acting on the solid in the @xmath17 direction is generated by the elastic collisions of the gas particles , where the collision rate depends on the velocity of the solid particles . because @xmath59 , we have the force balance equation in the steady state as @xmath60 = 0 $ ] .",
    "here , we note that @xmath61 we then expand the total force @xmath60 $ ] in @xmath62 . defining @xmath63 and @xmath64",

    "we now derive the temperature gaps for the model we consider .",
    "first , we shall find a relation connecting the temperature gap with the heat flux .",
    "let @xmath71 be the heat flux transferred from the gas to the @xmath22-th solid particle at the left end , and @xmath72 be the increasing rate of the kinetic energy per unit area of the @xmath22-th solid particle at the left end .",
    "the energy conservation law leads to @xmath73 .",
    "similarly , @xmath74 @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath75 the change in the kinetic energy of a solid particle for the collision of a solid particle of velocity @xmath76 with a gas particle of velocity @xmath42 , which is given by @xmath77 .",
    "we then calculate @xmath78 as @xmath79 . expanding this expression in @xmath80",
    ", we obtain @xmath81 see appendix [ sec : appendix ] for the derivation .",
    "these equations mean that the heat flux is related to the temperature gap @xcite .",
    "the average heat flux through the solid from the left to the right is written as @xmath82 for any @xmath22 .",
    "second , we consider the heat flux . in general",
    ", the heat flux depends on the interaction potential between solid particles , and it is difficult to calculate it from a microscopic description .",
    "nevertheless , by selecting a proper short - range interaction between solid particles in our model , we may phenomenologically assume fourier s law in the form @xmath83 where @xmath84 and @xmath85 represent the thermal conductivity and the axial length of the solid , respectively , and the temperature dependence of @xmath84 is ignored . from ( [ eq : jl ] ) , ( [ eq : jr ] ) , and ( [ eq : fourier ] ) , we obtain @xmath86 and @xmath87 }   ( t_{\\rm r}-t_{\\rm l } ) + o(\\epsilon ) .",

    "@xcite for an intuitive explanation of the result .     versus the heat flux over the pressure @xmath89 for @xmath90 ( square , red ) , @xmath91 ( circle , green ) , @xmath92 ( triangle , blue ) , and @xmath93 ( diamond , pink ) .",
    "the dotted line represents @xmath94 . ]    in order to directly demonstrate the validity of our theory , we performed numerical experiments by solving the hamiltonian equations in combination with the poisson process . here ,",
    "for simplicity , we consider the case that the system is defined in two dimensions .",
    "concretely , we use the potentials @xmath95 for the @xmath96-th nearest neighbor pair of solid particles ( @xmath97 ) and @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the spring constant , @xmath100 the natural length , and @xmath101 the nearest position of the tube wall from @xmath102 .",
    "all the quantities are converted into dimensionless forms by setting @xmath103 .",
    "we then set the parameter values as @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "because the equations are nonlinear , we observed the temperature gradient inside the solid and the temperature gaps at the surface of the solid .",
    "we then measured @xmath107 and @xmath108 for several values of @xmath1 and @xmath109 , and plotted @xmath110 in fig .",
    "we find that the obtained data is consistent with the nontrivial relation ( [ eq : v - j ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the experimental feasibility of the phenomenon under consideration . as one example of laboratory experiments , we consider silicon and helium of atomic weight 28 and 4 , respectively , where @xmath111 .",
    "the thermal conductivity of silicon at room temperature is @xmath112 , and the density of silicon is @xmath113 .",
    "we set @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath118 . by using ( [ eq :",
    "f_gap ] ) , ( [ eq : j_exp ] ) , ( [ eq : tgap_exp ] ) , and ( [ eq : v - j ] ) , we obtain the velocity of the solid @xmath119 , the temperature gap @xmath120 , and the temperature - gap - induced force @xmath121 .",
    "these estimated values are large enough to be measured in careful experiments .",
    "we next consider several possible difficulties that may arise in experiments .",
    "first , there is the friction between the solid and the tube . because the coefficient of static friction of a lubricant is at most @xmath122 @xcite , the static friction force is about @xmath123 , which is less than @xmath124 .",
    "thus , the effect of the friction can be mitigated by the use of a lubricant .",
    "second , one may worry that the relaxation time of the motion of the solid is longer than the observation time .",
    "however , since the relaxation time is estimated as @xmath125 , the velocity of the solid is rapidly relaxed to the steady - state value .",
    "can be measured in the experiment , while the steady - state motion is not observed . ]",
    "lastly , the most difficult experimental setup may be the control of the temperatures of the gases .",
    "one method is to connect the tube with baths of dilute gas , where the length of the tube is chosen to be shorter than the mean - free path of the dilute gas as shown in fig .",
    "the mean - free path of the helium atoms at @xmath126 and @xmath127 is about @xmath128 and is inversely proportional to the pressure .",
    "therefore , when the length of the tube is @xmath129 , we have to set the pressure at @xmath130 , and @xmath11 becomes very small . on the contrary ,",
    "when the mean - free path is much shorter than the length of the tube , a temperature gradient appears in the gases .",
    "this makes @xmath131 small , and as a result @xmath11 becomes small .",
    "the simplest realization is to control the temperatures from the side wall of the tube . in this case , we immobilize the solid by linking a spring to it ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "because the value of the stall force is equal to @xmath11 , we can measure its value , whereas we can not observe the steady - state motion .",
    "setting aside the quantitative aspects , we may observe phenomena to which @xmath11 makes a dominant contribution .",
    "one example is a brownian particle under a temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "if the thermal conductivity of the particle is much larger than that of a solution , heat flux passes inside the particle .",
    "then , because the temperature gap appears on the solid surface , the force @xmath11 is generated .",
    "it should be noted , however , that other types of forces appear on the particle under a temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "it is a stimulating challenge to separate @xmath11 from the total force .",
    "in this paper , we have predicted that the temperature gap at the interface between a solid and a gas yields the force @xmath11 . because this force is not described by standard continuum theory such as hydrodynamics and elastic theory , further experimental and theoretical studies are necessary so as to obtain a systematic understanding of the nature of the force . before ending the paper ,",
    "we provide a few remarks .    with regard to our setup",
    ", similar models were studied in the context of the so - called adiabatic piston problem @xcite .",
    "indeed , for the case @xmath132 $ ] or @xmath133 , we obtain @xmath134 + o(\\epsilon^2)$ ] and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 .",
    "these expressions for @xmath108 and @xmath107 are identical to those derived in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", it should be noted that @xmath7 in the preceding studies was assumed to be the total mass of the solid , which gives much smaller values of @xmath108 and @xmath107 than ours .",
    "in contrast to the interface case , there exists no force due to temperature differences at the atomic scale in the bulk . in order to clearly understand the difference between the two cases",
    ", we should derive @xmath11 on the basis of a mechanical description of solids and gases .",
    "this fundamental question might be solved by considering hydrodynamics of a binary mixture fluid in the phase separation state . because hydrodynamics may involve the discontinuity of the temperature profile at the interface between the two materials ,",
    "the standard assumption of slowly varying thermodynamic quantities may not be valid .",
    "the derivation may be obtained as an extension of a recent work @xcite in which the hydrodynamic equations for a simple fluid are derived from a hamiltonian description of identical particles . obviously , the experimental measurement of @xmath11 is of great importance even for the theory . by clarifying the mechanism of nonstandard forces ,",
    "we hope to develop the understanding of nonequilibrium systems .",
