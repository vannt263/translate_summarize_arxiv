    "first attempts to measure @xmath9 in this way , which is one of the major goals of several @xmath11-physics experiments starting very soon , have recently been performed by the opal and cdf collaborations @xcite .    in this paper , we will have a closer look at the general structure of the @xmath1 decay amplitude arising within the standard model , and at the one of its @xmath2-spin counterpart @xmath0 .",
    "the two decays are related to each other by interchanging all down and strange quarks , i.e.  through the `` @xmath2-spin '' subgroup of the @xmath12 flavour symmetry of strong interactions . whereas the weak phase factor @xmath13 enters in @xmath1 in a strongly cabibbo - suppressed way ,",
    "this is not the case in @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , there may be sizeable cp - violating effects in this @xmath14 decay , which are due to the interference between current  current and penguin operator contributions .",
    "interestingly , the time evolution of the @xmath0 decay rate allows us to determine @xmath3 . to this end",
    ", we have to employ the @xmath2-spin symmetry to fix the overall normalization of @xmath0 through the cp - averaged @xmath1 rate . this new strategy to extract @xmath3",
    "is not affected by qcd or electroweak penguin effects  it rather makes use of these topologies  and does not rely on certain `` plausible '' dynamical or model - dependent assumptions .",

    "the theoretical accuracy is only limited by @xmath2-spin - breaking corrections .",
    "an analogous strategy is provided by the time - dependent @xmath5 rate , if its overall normalization is fixed through the cp - averaged @xmath6 rate , and if the @xmath15@xmath16 mixing phase , i.e.  @xmath17 , is determined with the help of @xmath18 .",
    "in particular the determination of @xmath3 is an important goal for future @xmath11-physics experiments .",
    "this angle should be measured in a variety of ways so as to check whether one consistently finds the same result .",
    "there are several methods to accomplish this task on the market @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath19 @xmath11-factories operating at the @xmath20 resonance will not be in a position to explore @xmath14 decays , a strong emphasis has been given to decays of non - strange @xmath11 mesons in the recent literature .",
    "however , also the @xmath14 system provides interesting strategies to determine @xmath3 . in order to make use of these methods , dedicated @xmath11-physics experiments at hadron machines , such as lhcb , are the natural place . within the standard model , the weak @xmath21@xmath22",

    "future @xmath11-physics experiments performed at hadron machines should be in a position to resolve these oscillations .",
    "interestingly , in contrast to the @xmath26 case , there may be a sizeable width difference @xmath27 between the mass eigenstates of the @xmath14 system @xcite , which may allow studies of cp violation with `` untagged '' @xmath14 data samples , where one does not distinguish between initially , i.e.  at time @xmath28 , present @xmath29 or @xmath22 mesons @xcite .",
    "in such untagged rates , the rapid @xmath21@xmath22 oscillations cancel .",
    "some of the @xmath14 strategies proposed in the literature are theoretically clean , and use pure `` tree '' decays , for example @xmath30 @xcite . since no flavour - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) processes contribute to the corresponding decay amplitudes , it is quite unlikely that they are significantly affected by new physics .",
    "consequently , the preferred mechanism for physics beyond the standard model to manifest itself in the corresponding time - dependent decay rates is through contributions to @xmath21@xmath22 mixing .",
    "in contrast , the decay @xmath0 discussed in this paper exhibits also cp - violating effects that are due to the interference between `` tree '' and `` penguin '' , i.e.  fcnc , processes .",

    "it can be probed with the help of the decay @xmath108 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
