    "from a strictly theoretical perspective , there exists a significant difference between the octet pseudoscalar mesons@xmath6,k,@xmath7and their singlet counterpart - @xmath8.@xcite the former are legitimate pseudo - goldstone bosons whose masses vanish in the chiral limit while the latter is not due to the anomalous breaking of the axial u(3 ) symmetry down to su(3 ) .",
    "however , in the real world , this does not seem to make much difference .",
    "indeed , the physical eigenstates@xmath1are mixtures of octet and singlet components @xmath9 and the mixing angle @xmath5 is an important quantity in confronting theoretical calculations with experimental results in these systems.@xcite    the mixing angle can be evaluated in various ways but a standard procedure involves the diagonalization of the @xmath10 mass matrix , which at lowest order yields a mixing angle @xmath11 .",
    "this can easily be seen by writing the mass matrix as @xmath12 employing the gell - mann - okubo ( gmo ) relation to fix @xmath13 as@xcite @xmath14 and diagonalizing , one can determine @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath5 , in terms of @xmath17 , yielding @xmath18    however , the gmo relation , eq.[eq5 ] , is valid only at lowest order@xmath19)in chiral perturbation theory .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath20 ) corrections to the relation results in significant changes . characterizing these via @xmath21 a leading logarithm estimate@xcite @xmath22 yields @xmath23 , which yields @xmath24 suggesting a doubling of the mixing angle .",
    "a full one - loop chiral perturbation theory calculation confirms this finding.@xcite it is also interesting that this solution is consistent with the assumptions of simple @xmath25 symmetry wherein @xmath26 have the same wavefunction , leading to @xmath27 note that this result is strongly dependent upon chiral symmetry breaking effects on the gmo prediction .",
    "an alternative and independent approach to the problem involves the use of the chiral anomaly , which is responsible for the well - known @xmath28 decays.@xcite in the case of @xmath29 , at lowest order@xmath30the anomalous ( wess - zumino - witten ) chiral lagrangian predicts@xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the polarization , momenta of the outgoing photons , and @xmath33 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit .",
    "a leading log calculation of the chiral corrections reveals that the dominant effect is simply to replace @xmath33 by its physical value @xmath34 the resulting amplitude is guaranteed by general theorems to remain unchanged in higher chiral orders.@xcite one then finds that the predicted amplitude @xmath35 is in excellent agreement with the corresponding experimental value@xcite @xmath36 thus providing the confidence that one may be able to analyze the @xmath10 decays with a similar precision .    in case of",
    "the @xmath37 decays , one must include both , mixing as well as renormalization of the octet , singlet couplings , yielding the predicted amplitudes effects , where @xmath38 is the chiral scale , are included in the renormalization of the pseudoscalar couplings @xmath3 , @xmath4 and in the mixing angle @xmath5 .",
    "this does not have to be the case , but appears to be borne out by the consistency of the results obtained from treatments of differing manifestations of the anomaly , as we show below and as others have found . ]",
    "@xmath39 from the pdg one extracts experimental values@xcite @xmath40    in order to solve the system , however , we require an additional assumption since there are three unknowns@xmath41and only two pieces of data . the usual approach in this case is to use the leading log prediction of one - loop chiral perturbation theory to predict@xcite @xmath42   \\approx 1.30   \\label{eq15}\\ ] ] and then solve for @xmath43 , yielding @xmath44 it is interesting to note that these results are quite consistent with those obtained from the one - loop analysis of the mass matrix_i.e . _",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 consistent with the value  unity  which one would have if the singlet state and the pion were to have the same wavefunction .",
    "while this agreement is satisfying , the extraction of these mixing parameters requires certain theoretical inputs , either eq .",
    "[ eq15 ] or eq .",
    "[ eq : aa ] , and it is interesting to inquire whether one can predict the mixing angle purely phenomenologically . as we shall show , the answer is yes , provided one utilizes the additional information available from the anomalous decays @xmath47.@xcite    in the next section then we show how the decays @xmath47 can be analyzed in order to isolate the chiral anomaly .",
    "this involves a careful study of final state interactions and unitarity constraints in order to realistically extrapolate to zero four - momenta , as required by the anomaly . in the concluding section",
    ", we apply these results to evaluate @xmath48 in an essentially model independent fashion .",
    "our goal is to use the experimental data on @xmath47 in order to isolate the value of the anomaly in these decays .",
    "the resulting numbers can then be fit to the appropriate theoretical expressions , thus allowing extraction of the renormalized mixing angle and coupling constants . to this end",
    ", we define @xmath49 where @xmath50 , k are the outgoing 4-momenta , @xmath51 is the photon polarization vector , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the chiral anomaly ( _ cf . _ figure 1(a ) ) requires @xmath54    note , however , that the chiral anomaly , strictly speaking , only constrains the form factors @xmath55 at zero four momentum@xmath56while the experimental input occurs at @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "one indication of this fact is that , using the simple energy - independent form given in eq .",
    "[ eq : ww ] to calculate the decay rate , one obtains for the @xmath59-channel the value @xmath60 ev compared to the experimental rate of @xmath61 ev . for the @xmath62 channel things",
    "are even worse@xmath63 kev while the theoretical value arising from use of the simple anomaly amplitude is a factor of twenty less !",
    "we conclude that in order to extract values for the anomaly in these transitions , it is absolutely essential to correctly model the energy dependence of the amplitude in the physical region .",
    "this problem is not unique , of course , to the @xmath64 system and has been addressed previously in the extraction of the anomaly in @xmath65 from the primakoff - effect data of antipov et al.@xcite in this case , one also has a clear prediction of the chiral anomaly.@xcite writing @xmath66 where @xmath67 , the chiral stricture demands @xmath68 the effects of p - wave pi - pi interactions at low and moderate energies are known to be reasonably described by vector dominance.@xcite in particular , the models described in ref.@xcite , which incorporate vector dominance and chiral symmetry , when applied to the @xmath65 reaction , provide a form @xmath69\\ ] ] which matches on to the anomaly at zero four - momentum but also offers a plausible extension into the physical region .",
    "this form must be modified , of course , in order to confront real data since unitarity demands the presence of branch cuts and consequent imaginary components in the form factor .",
    "this is clear from a one - loop chiral perturbation theory calculation , which yields@xcite @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 here we note that the imaginary component of the function @xmath72 is given in terms of the energy - dependent width of the rho meson via @xmath73 where @xmath74    this one - loop form is no doubt appropriate in the near threshold region .",
    "however , once @xmath75 or so , one does not anticipate that a simple one - loop description will be adequate . in order to address these difficulties ,",
    "the use of an n / d form has been suggested.@xcite in this approach , one utilizes the omnes function , which encodes information concerning the pi - pi interaction@xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the ( @xmath78 ) p - wave pi - pi phase shift at center of mass energy @xmath79 .",
    "there are two ways to proceed at this point .",
    "* one can use the experimental phase shifts , with some assumptions made about their asyptotic form . in our case",
    "we took the values quoted by froggatt and peterson,@xcite which are given up to @xmath79 = 1 gev and assumed a constant value after that .",
    "we label the omnes function obtained in this way as @xmath80 .",
    "* one can employ a simple analytic form@xcite @xmath81 which has been shown to provide an approximate description of the empirical @xmath82 p - wave phase shifts in the low energy region.@xcite we label the omnes function obtained via this procedure as @xmath83 .    using either of these forms , and postulating an n / d form of the @xmath65 amplitude as @xmath84\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\left({1-{s\\over m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(s)}\\right ) \\left({1-{t\\over",
    "m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(t)}\\right)\\left({1-{u\\over m_\\rho^2}\\over d_1(u)}\\right ) \\label{eq35}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see that eq .",
    "[ eq35 ] matches onto the one - loop chiral result in the limit of low energies _ and _ onto the vector dominance form when unitarity inspired logarithms are dropped .    whether such an n / d form accurately describes the data for @xmath65 awaits the arrival of sufficiently precise information from cebaf and cern",
    "however , it certainly appears to satisfy the various criteria which nature demands , and suggests the treatment of the related @xmath47 decay amplitudes in a parallel fashion .    in the case of the @xmath85",
    "decays we can proceed similarly . in this case , the one - loop chiral perturbation theory calculation gives @xmath86\\ ] ] while vector dominance ( _ cf .",
    "_ figure 1(b , c))yields @xmath87\\ ] ] certainly , in order to treat the decay of the @xmath62 , one must go further and include unitarity effects via final state interactions .",
    "one very simple approach is to include the ( energy - dependent ) width of the rho - meson in the propagator via @xmath88 this use of vector width - modified vector dominance already makes an important difference from the simple anomaly  tree level ",
    "results ( especially in the case of the @xmath62 ) , changing the predicted decay widths from the values 35 ev and 3 kev quoted above to the much more realistic numbers @xmath89 if the parameters @xmath90 are employed .",
    "however , this approach does not reproduce the one - loop chiral form in the low energy limit .    in order to determine a form for the final state interactions which matches onto both the one - loop chiral correction _ and _ to the vector dominance result in the appropriate limits",
    ", we postulate an n / d structure , as in the related @xmath91 case @xmath92\\label{eq : ii}\\ ] ] where for the omnes function we use one of the two forms itemized above and @xmath93 are free parameters to be determined . in order to reproduce the coefficient of the @xmath94 function , which contains the rho width , we require @xmath95 . on the other hand , matching onto the vmd result at @xmath96 can be achieved by the choice @xmath97 .",
    "thus in the case of the @xmath59 the form is completely determined . since the @xmath62 spectrum is closely related and",
    "is dominated by the presence of the rho we shall assume an identical form for the @xmath62 case .",
    "using these forms we can then calculate the decay widths assuming the theoretical values for the anomaly . using the parameters given in eq .",
    "[ eq : hh ] one finds , for example , @xmath98 there is a tendency then for the numbers obtained via the analytic form of the omnes function to be somewhat too high .",
    "we can also compare the predicted spectra with the corresponding experimentally determined values . as shown in figure 2",
    ", we observe that the experimental spectra are well fit in the @xmath59 case in terms of both the n / d or the vmd forms , but that the one - loop chiral expression does not provide an adequate representation of the data.@xcite in the case of the corresponding @xmath62 decay the results are shown in figure 3 , wherein we observe that either the unitarized vmd or the use of @xmath99 provides a reasonable fit to the data ( we get @xmath100/dof=32/17 and 20/17 , respectively ) , while the use of the analytic form for the omnes function yields a predicted spectrum ( @xmath100/dof=104/17 ) which is slightly too low on the high energy end .",
    "however , for both @xmath59 and @xmath62 we see that our simple ansatz  eq.[eq : ii]provides a very satisfactory representation of the decay spectrum .",
    "our conclusion in the last section was that if the mixing angle and pseudoscalar coupling constants were given values consistent with present theoretical and experimental leanings , then the predicted widths and spectra of both @xmath101 are basically consistent with experimental values .",
    "our goal in this section is to go the other way , however . that is , using the assumed n / d forms for the decay amplitude , and treating the pseudoscalar decay constants @xmath102 as well as the @xmath103 mixing angle @xmath5 as free parameters , we wish to inquire as to how well they can be constrained purely from the experimental data on @xmath104 and @xmath85 decays , with reasonable assumptions made about the final state interaction effects in these two channels .    on theoretical grounds , one is somewhat more confident about the extraction of the threshold amplitude in the case of the lower energy @xmath105 system .",
    "indeed , in this case the physical region extends only slightly into the tail of the rho unlike the related @xmath62 decay wherein the spectrum extends completely over the resonance so that there exists considerable sensitivity to details of the shape .",
    "thus a first approach might be to utilize only the two - photon decays together with the @xmath105 width in order to determine the three desired parameters . in this fashion one",
    "finds the results shown in table 1 .",
    ".values of the renormalized pseudoscalar coupling constants and the @xmath103 mixing angle using the @xmath106 and @xmath107 amplitudes in a three parameter fit . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we observe that the central values stay fixed but that the error bars are somewhat reduced .",
    "the conclusions are the same , however  substantial renormalization for @xmath108 , almost none for @xmath109 , and a mixing angle @xmath110 .",
    "these numbers appear nearly invariant , regardless of the approach .",
    "before summarizing the results of our above analysis , it should certainly be emphasized that we are not the first to undertake the program of isolating the anomaly from the @xmath111 data .",
    "indeed , there has been considerable work in this regard , both on the theoretical side @xcite as well as experimentally , including the most recently published @xmath112 data.@xcite the recent analysis of ref.@xcite leads to results quite different from ours in both the mixing angle as well as the renormalization of the pseudoscalar couplings . on the other hand , ref.@xcite ( at least for the model labeled @xmath113 )",
    "finds a somewhat smaller mixing angle ( @xmath114 ) and pseudoscalar renormalization ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "however , there is an important difference between these analyses and our own . in refs.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the decay amplitude is written in terms of a piece due to the anomaly ( parametrized by @xmath116 ) and a component due to the rho pole ( parametrized by @xmath117 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath118 is then fitted , through a minimization procedure , to produce the experimental spectrum and partial widths . in our analysis ,",
    "the parameters of the two pieces are fixed @xmath119 to reproduce the results of one - loop chiral perturbation theory @xcite ( by fixing @xmath95 ) and vmd @xcite ( by fixing @xmath120 ) .",
    "( indeed a recent analysis of other i=1 @xmath121 processes found that only within a model such as ref.@xcite , which links chiral symmetry and vmd , could the data be fit consistently @xcite ) .",
    "however , following the picture of ref.@xcite , we do not include a non - resonant coupling in @xmath122 ( as considered in models @xmath113 and @xmath123 of @xcite ) .",
    "our successful fits of the experimental data speak for themselves .    in previous treatments of the @xmath124 system via the anomaly , which have omitted @xmath111 constraints , the mixing angle @xmath5 has generally been determined only at the cost of theoretical assumptions about the renormalization of the octet pseudoscalar coupling constant @xmath3 with respect to @xmath125 .",
    "we have in this paper asked whether it is possible to obtain the mixing angle in a fashion relatively independent of such theoretical assumptions by simultaneously fitting @xmath104 as well as @xmath85 decays . as shown above",
    ", the answer is affirmative .",
    "however , one must incorporate _ some _ sort of model for the final state interactions of the pi - pi system in order to extrapolate down to zero four - momentum where the anomaly obtains .",
    "we have argued that the @xmath99 form given in eq .",
    "[ eq : ii ] is reasonable both on theoretical grounds  matching both the requirements of vmd and of low energy chiral symmetry  and via successful fitting of the experimental spectra . using this form and the pdg values for @xmath104 and @xmath126 amplitudes we have obtained values @xmath127 which are quite consistent with those obtained in previous analyses which required assumptions about chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "one can then assess these results in two different ways .",
    "although it is our contention that the assumptions made above concerning pion - pion interactions are relatively model - independent and that the numbers given thereby in eq .",
    "[ eq : qq ] are quite solid , one could also take a contrary view that the forms utilized for final state interactions _ do _ require critical dynamical assumptions . in this case , however , we would argue that via three quite different routes    * mass matrix analysis including gmo breaking * @xmath104 analysis with assumptions made about @xmath128 * simultaneous analysis of @xmath104 and @xmath85 with ( minimal ) assumptions concerning final state pi - pi interactions    one finds virtually the same value of the mixing angle@xmath129and for pseudoscalar couplings@xmath130 . in any case",
    ", we would assert that these values are now strongly ( and independently ) confirmed from within the chiral anomaly sector .",
