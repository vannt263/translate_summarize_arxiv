    "quantum interference and its suppression caused by interactions with external degrees of freedom have been central subjects of mesoscopic physics for more than a decade  @xcite .",
    "these subjects deal with the transition from quantum to classical phenomena in mesoscopic scales . in particular ,  which - path \" ( wp ) detection in mesoscopic quantum interferometers provides an ideal playground for studying the complementarity ( which is often identified with ` wave - particle duality ' ) in quantum theory .",
    "experiments on the controlled dephasing have been performed in mesoscopic structures based on quantum dots ( qd )  @xcite .",
    "a prototype experimental setup for this kind of study  @xcite is as follows .",
    "coherent transmission of electrons is monitored by using an aharonov - bohm ( ab ) interferometer with a qd inserted in one of the interferometer s arms  @xcite .",
    "a mesoscopic detector is electrostatically coupled to the qd .",
    "because of electrostatic interactions , the electron state in the detector depends on the charge state of the qd , which results in a quantum correlation ( i.e. ,  entanglement \" ) between the qd and the detector .",
    "the ab oscillation of the conductance through the interferometer is suppressed because of the wp information transferred to the detector .",
    "this  measurement - induced dephasing \" is controlled through the voltage applied across the mesoscopic detector .",
    "the controlled dephasing experiments were carried out also without an ab interferometer  @xcite , because it is possible to study the coherence by the resonant transmission through a qd .",
    "various theoretical approaches were used to study this problem  @xcite .",
    "the controlled dephasing experiment was also performed in the kondo limit of the qd  @xcite .",
    "a kondo singlet is formed between the localized spin in a qd and electrons in the leads  @xcite , which gives rise to enhanced transport through the qd  @xcite .",
    "it was shown that a nearby quantum point contact ( qpc ) capacitively coupled to the qd plays a role of a  potential detector \" and suppresses the kondo resonance  @xcite .",
    "however , characteristics of the measured suppression were very different from the theoretical prediction of ref .",
    "the most significant deviation from the theory is that the measured suppression strength is much larger ( about 30 times ) than expected .",
    "dependence on the transmission probability ( @xmath0 ) and on the bias voltage ( @xmath1 ) across the qpc were also inconsistent with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the analysis of the experiment  @xcite was based on a theory  @xcite of dephasing of the kondo resonance as a result of path detection by the qpc through the change of the transmission _",
    "probability _ , @xmath2 .",
    "it was pointed out that this kind of treatment does not fully take into account the wp information acquired in the detector  @xcite .",
    "it is because scattering of electrons at the qpc is a quantum mechanical phenomenon with complex transmission and reflection amplitudes .",
    "therefore , in general , _ phase - sensitive _",
    "information should also be taken into account  @xcite .    in this paper , first we present a theory of the entanglement of the kondo singlet with a mesoscopic detector ( section 2 ) .",
    "the formulation is based on the variational ground state of the kondo singlet  @xcite correlated with the charge - dependent detector state .",
    "we , then , report on our investigations of dephasing in the kondo state controlled by charge detection ( section 3 )",
    ". discussions in section 2 and 3 are mainly extension of the study in ref .  @xcite . in addition , a refined model for the detector is introduced which explains the importance of the phase - sensitive wp information . in section 4",
    ", we introduce the concept of the  conditional evolution \" of the kondo singlet under projective measurement on the detector .",
    "we show that the phase - sensitive information is erased and the kondo state suffers relaxation in a way that depends on the charge sensitivity of the detector current .",
    "conclusion is given in section 5 .",
    "also , the relation between the scattering matrix and the parallel shift of the one - dimensional potential is derived in the appendix .",
    "the model system we investigate is schematically drawn in figure  1 .",
    "first , to describe the kondo singlet of the qd , we adopt the variational ground state for the impurity anderson model  @xcite .",
    "this variational ground state captures the essential kondo physics in a simple but effective way .",
    "furthermore , this approach can be easily applied for describing the entanglement of the kondo singlet with the detector .",
    "the hamiltonian for the qd + two electrodes + tunneling is given by @xmath3 the left ( l ) and the right ( r ) leads are described by the noninteracting fermi sea as [ eq : hamil ] @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 is an annihilation ( creation ) operator of an electron with energy @xmath7 , momentum @xmath8 , and spin @xmath9 on the lead @xmath10 .",
    "the interacting qd is represented by @xmath11 given as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the qd electron annihilation and creation operators , respectively , and @xmath15 .",
    "the parameters , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , stand for the energy of the localized level and the on - site coulomb interaction , respectively .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath18 has the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is responsible for the tunneling between the qd and the lead @xmath10 . in the absence of interaction between the qd and the detector , the variational ground state for the hamiltonian @xmath21 ( @xmath22 limit )",
    "is written as  @xcite @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the fermi sea for the leads with an empty qd state , and @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the average occupation number of the qd level and @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the ground state energy determined by the equation @xmath31 the kondo temperature ( @xmath32 ) , the characteristic energy scale of the system , is given as a difference between the qd level ( @xmath16 ) and the ground state energy ( @xmath30 ) : @xmath33 .",
    "in fact , the states @xmath24 and @xmath34 have different occupation numbers for the qd : @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively . a detector ( usually a mesoscopic conductor ) near to the qd is able to detect the charge state , since the potential of the detector depends on the charge state of the qd . so the transmission and reflection amplitudes of the detector also depend on @xmath37 .",
    "this correlation can be described by an entangled state for the composite system as @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) denotes the detector state when the kondo system is in the state @xmath42 . here , a two - terminal single - channel conductor is considered as the detector .",
    "then , an injected electron from the left electrode of the detector can be described by the state @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the @xmath46-dependent reflection and transmission coefficients , respectively .",
    "the state @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) corresponds to the state of reflection ( transmission ) for an injected electron .",
    "it is important to note that the scattering coefficients are complex numbers that can be expressed as @xmath49 and satisfy the unitarity relation @xmath50 .",
    "dephasing of the kondo singlet takes place when an observer ( detector ) monitors the kondo system ( which is a part of the composite system ) .",
    "this can be described in terms of the reduced density matrix approach . before interaction of the two subsystems , the density matrix of the kondo singlet",
    "is given as @xmath51 .",
    "upon a single scattering event with the detector , the reduced density matrix @xmath52 of the kondo system is given as @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes a trace over the detector degree of freedom .",
    "it is found that the diagonal elements of @xmath52 do not change upon scattering at the detector . on the other hand ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements are modified by @xmath55 where @xmath56 this quantity represents the information of the charge state in the qd transferred to the detector .",
    "that is , @xmath57 implies that the two states are orthogonal .",
    "thus , a complete charge - state information is transferred to the detector . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the two charge states are identical which means that the detector does not obtain any information on the qd state .",
    "dephasing of the kondo singlet takes place for @xmath59 .",
    "it is obvious from equation  ( [ eq : lambda ] ) that the dephasing is associated not only with the current sensitivity but also with the phase sensitivity of the scattering coefficients of the detector .",
    "we consider the weak continuous measurement limit where the scattering through the detector takes place on a time scale much shorter than the relevant time scales in the kondo singlet . in our case , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 denotes the average time between two successive scattering events with @xmath1 being the voltage applied across the detector .",
    "the parameter , @xmath62 , is the dephasing time of the kondo singlet .",
    "this assumption allows us to use the markov approximation that neglects the memory effect in the detector . then after the scattering of @xmath63 electrons through the detector the off - diagonal component of the density matrix is given as @xmath64 where @xmath65 .",
    "note that the time evolution of the density matrix here is written in the heisenberg picture in order to eliminate the less important dynamical phase factor .",
    "this equation can be rewritten in the form @xmath66 where the two parameters , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , represent the phase shift and the dephasing rate , respectively , caused by the detection processes .",
    "one can find that @xmath69 on the other hand , the diagonal terms are independent of time .",
    "this implies that no relaxation takes place in the kondo singlet .    in the weak measurement limit , @xmath70 , @xmath68 and @xmath67",
    "can be expressed in terms of the changes in the magnitude and phase of the scattering amplitudes of the detector as @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 here , @xmath74 ( @xmath75 ) is the transmission probability in the absence ( presence ) of an extra electron in the qd .",
    "@xmath76 represents the change in the transmission probability .",
    "the phase shift @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 , where @xmath79 ( @xmath80 ) is the change in the transmission ( reflection ) amplitude resulting from the different charge states : @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "the effect of dephasing can be investigated through electron transport in the kondo system . the best way for studying",
    "the dephasing would be to compose a two - path ab interferometer with a kondo - correlated qd inserted in one arm of the interferometer  @xcite ( figure  2 ) . in this case , the total transmission probability ( @xmath83 ) through the interferometer is given as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 stand for the transmission amplitudes through the reference arm and through the qd , respectively .",
    "the relative phase shift @xmath87 is controlled by the external ab flux @xmath88 as @xmath89 the magnitude of the ab oscillation in equation  ( [ eq : tab ] ) , denoted by @xmath90 , is given as @xmath91 the measurement - induced dephasing is expected to reduce @xmath92 .",
    "for a more quantitative study , we use the following relationship between @xmath86 and green s function for the qd , @xmath93 , at the fermi energy ( @xmath94 ) as  @xcite @xmath95 where @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) is the tunneling rate of an electron between the qd and the left ( right ) electrode .",
    "green s function for the mixed state described by the reduced density matrix @xmath52 ( see the previous section ) is defined by @xmath98_+    \\right ) \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath99_+$ ] denotes the anti - commutator .",
    "green s function can be evaluated in a similar way to the one in ref .",
    "we need to use the equations of motion for various green s functions and truncate higher order terms of @xmath100 with @xmath101 being the spin degeneracy . neglecting the incoherent background and the energy shift @xmath67 ,",
    "we obtain the following expression in the kondo limit ( @xmath102 ) @xmath103 therefore we find that the magnitude of the ab oscillation is reduced by the dephasing when the voltage @xmath1 is applied in the detector by the factor @xmath104 note that the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath90 comes through the relation  ( [ eq:1/td ] ) .",
    "alternatively , one can study the dephasing of the kondo singlet through direct transport through the qd without interferometry ( figure  1 ) .",
    "the phase coherence of the kondo state appears in the resonant transport through the double - barriers which is an electronic analogue of the fabry - perot interferometer  @xcite .",
    "the experiment carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite used this geometry . in this case , the conductance is proportional to @xmath105 , leading to the suppression of the conductance at a finite detector bias @xmath1 , by the factor @xmath106      from our discussion , it is obvious that the kondo resonance is reduced by the charge detection of the qd through the coherent scattering at the detector .",
    "this coherent scattering is described by the complex transmission and reflection coefficients . in the weak measurement limit",
    ", the dephasing rate is given by the phase - sensitive ( @xmath77 ) as well as the current - sensitive ( @xmath2 ) detection .",
    "the phase - sensitive contribution to dephasing @xmath107 was not taken into account in the experimental report of ref .",
    "the much stronger dephasing rate than expected in the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite which takes only @xmath108 into account suggests a large contribution from the phase - sensitive dephasing , i.e. , @xmath109 .",
    "one of the authors ( k.  k. ) has pointed out previously  @xcite that phase - sensitive dephasing might be dominant in a generic situation if the asymmetry in the charge sensitivity of the detector potential is taken into account . here , we provide a refined version of the detector model for demonstrating this behavior .",
    "first , @xmath110 if the detector potential and its variation resulting from an extra qd electron have inversion symmetries  @xcite and thus the phase - sensitive contribution vanishes  @xcite",
    ". however , in reality , there is no reason to believe that the response of the detector potential to the qd charge should be symmetric .",
    "we take into account the asymmetric as well as the symmetric variation of the detector potential . the potential profile",
    "@xmath111 depends on the charge state of the qd @xmath112 .",
    "we use a one - dimensional inverse harmonic potential for the detector as ( see figure  3 ) @xmath113 the parameter @xmath114 corresponds to the symmetric component of the charge sensitivity .",
    "its asymmetry is accounted for by the parallel shift @xmath115 of the potential profile .",
    "the transmission probability @xmath116 ( @xmath117 ) can be exactly calculated in this model  @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath118 where the dimensionless variables @xmath119 and @xmath120 are defined by @xmath121 in the weak measurement limit ( @xmath122 ) , we find that @xmath123 @xmath114 , the symmetric component of the potential response , does not contribute to the phase - sensitive dephasing  @xcite",
    ". then the phase sensitivity of the detector is purely given by the parallel shift @xmath115 of the potential as ( see appendix ) @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the fermi wave vector .",
    "therefore , for the potential profile used in equation  ( [ eq : qpc - potential ] ) , the dephasing rates are given by @xmath126     depending on the charge state @xmath46 ( @xmath127 ) of the quantum dot .",
    "the symmetric and the asymmetric responses to an extra electron of the quantum dot are taken into account via @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively . ]    in the case where the asymmetric response of the potential is comparable to the symmetric response , the following relation will be satisfied : @xmath128 where @xmath129 characterizes the length scale of the detector potential .",
    "this relation implies that the changes of the energy scales resulting from the symmetric and the asymmetric responses are comparable . with this condition",
    ", we get @xmath130 in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermi wavelength ( @xmath131 ) and the length scale of the detector potential are about @xmath132 nm and @xmath133 nm ) , respectively . therefore , @xmath134 and we find that @xmath135 because @xmath136 in our description , the condition @xmath109 can be achieved if the asymmetric response in the detector potential is not negligible .",
    "this conclusion can also be understood as follows .",
    "the transmission probability is affected across the region @xmath137 , while the phase is affected through a relatively wide region , so that the phase - sensitive detection is more effective .",
    "this leads to a large contribution of phase - sensitive dephasing and can be a natural explanation for the anomalously large dephasing rate observed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that our discussion on the large phase - sensitive dephasing is not restricted to the kondo limit .",
    "however , in the kondo limit , electrons in the kondo cloud may interact with the electron in the detector .",
    "we expect that this interaction rarely affects the transmission probability .",
    "but it contributes to the phase - sensitive dephasing .",
    "interactions with the kondo cloud is expected to increase the asymmetric response of the detector potential .",
    "this argument could explain why the phase - sensitive dephasing is more pronounced in the kondo limit than in the coulomb blockade limit .",
    "we also briefly remark on the @xmath138-dependence of @xmath68 . for the simple model of the detector considered here , @xmath68",
    "is expected to be proportional to the partition noise ( @xmath139 ) of the ideal single - channel detector .",
    "however , the experimental @xmath68-@xmath138 curve shows a double peak behavior  @xcite in contrast to the theoretical model .",
    "this qualitative discrepancy might be related to the so called  0.7 anomaly \"  @xcite where the shot noise is also suppressed  @xcite or to the charge screening effect  @xcite .",
    "this issue requires more careful experimental and theoretical analysis on the correlation between the dephasing of the kondo state and the shot noise of the detector .",
    "in this section , we investigate the time evolution of the kondo singlet _ conditioned on the observation of a particular measurement _ on the detector . the conditional dynamics of a state are obtained by an operation on a part of the system that corresponds to a specific classical outcome of measurement and renormalizing the reduced wave function so that it has a total probability of one ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of a two - terminal mesoscopic detector ,",
    "there are two possible outcomes of measurement on the detector , that is , transmission and reflection , for each of the injected electrons  @xcite .",
    "these measurement processes are described by the operators @xmath140 and @xmath141 defined as @xmath142 upon a measurement @xmath140 the state @xmath143 of equation  ( [ eq : psi_tot ] ) is reduced to @xmath144 as @xmath145 where @xmath146 unlike the state @xmath143 , the state @xmath144 of equation  ( [ eq : psi_t ] ) is not entangled but expressed as a product state of the kondo system and the detector .",
    "that is , under the projective measurement of the detector , the two subsystems are disentangled .",
    "this is because the measurement @xmath140 selects one of the two possible outcomes of the detector and the detector electron is collapsed onto the state @xmath48 .",
    "this means that we can describe the kondo state under measurement @xmath140 by a pure state @xmath147 .",
    "therefore , under a continuous weak measurement , we can write the conditional evolution of the kondo singlet as @xmath148 where the time evolution of the amplitudes @xmath149 and @xmath150 satisfy the relations ( upon a mean time interval @xmath151 between successive transmissions of electrons in the detector ) @xmath152 or simply one can find that @xmath153 this relation gives the time evolution of the ratio between the two coefficients as @xmath154 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath155 therefore the relative probability of the two states @xmath156 goes to zero at @xmath157 as @xmath158 this result implies that the kondo state evolves into the state @xmath24 at @xmath157 with its relaxation rate @xmath159 .",
    "in the weak measurement limit @xmath160 must be much smaller than unity and the relaxation rate is simplified as @xmath161    several interesting observations can be made from equations  ( [ eq : bovera],[eq : gamma_rel ] ) .",
    "first , the relaxation rate is sensitive only to the change of the transmission probability .",
    "it is independent of the phase shift .",
    "this is in strong contrast with the dephasing rate @xmath68 of equations  ( [ eq : gamma_d]-[eq : gamma_phi ] ) where the charge - state information is contained both in the change of the transmission probability and the phase shift . in other words ,",
    "the measurement @xmath140 on the state @xmath143 washes out part of the charge - state information encoded in the phase shift .",
    "indeed , for a detector sensitive only to the scattering phases ( that is , for @xmath162 ) , the kondo singlet of equation  ( [ eq : psi_g ] ) remains unchanged ( aside from the phase factor @xmath163 ) . in this case the phase coherence of the kondo singlet is fully preserved .",
    "in fact , this corresponds to the quantum erasure of the charge - state information by a particular measurement ( @xmath140 in our case ) on the detector  @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the kondo singlet , conditioned on the measurement @xmath140 , does not show any relaxation if the detector current is not sensitive to the charge state of the qd .    in an experiment ,",
    "this conditional evolution and relaxation of the kondo singlet can be investigated by correlating the transport of the electron through the qd and detection of electron at the output lead of the detector .",
    "for instance , let us consider an ab interferometer with a qd embedded in one of its arms and a detector nearby the qd as discussed in section 3 ( figure  2 ) .",
    "the kondo - resonant transport under the measurement @xmath140 can be studied through the zero - frequency cross - correlation measurement between the two output leads , one from the interferometer and the other from the detector ( see e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this case",
    ", the interference in the cross - correlation will be reduced in proportion to the relaxation rate @xmath159 . as discussed above",
    ", the suppression of the interference is related to the charge sensitivity of the detector in transmission probability .",
    "the phase - sensitive information would not affect the visibility in the joint detection of the electrons at the two output electrodes .",
    "we also point out that the cross - correlation measurement is able to resolve the anomaly observed in a controlled dephasing experiment of the kondo - correlated qd  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results show unusually larger than expected dephasing rate with theory  @xcite based on ` current - sensitive ' dephasing which is equivalent to @xmath108 in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_t ] ) . as we have shown in section 3.4 ,",
    "the phase - sensitive contribution of dephasing can be dominant ( that is , @xmath109 ) by taking into account asymmetry in the potential response .",
    "the relaxation rate @xmath159 does not contain the phase shift of the scattering coefficients .",
    "therefore , by measuring the conditional count on the kondo - resonant transmission , one can extract the value @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , by combining the cross - correlation and the usual current measurement , we can get the two different contributions of dephasing @xmath108 and @xmath107 .",
    "this would be a direct way to confirm the theoretical prediction on the importance of the contribution of asymmetry in the detector .    aside from the phase - sensitive contribution to dephasing , @xmath107 ,",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath164 .",
    "let us consider a system with perfect inversion symmetry ( thus @xmath165 ) in the detector .",
    "for the weak continuous measurement considered in our study , we can find that @xmath166 .",
    "in other words , the interference in the kondo - assisted transmission under the measurement @xmath140 is reduced much faster than in the case without the measurement .",
    "this can be regarded as an interesting manifestation of the nonlocality of quantum theory .",
    "so far in this section we have discussed conditional evolution under the measurement @xmath140 . the same kind of investigation can be done for the measurement @xmath141 .",
    "one can find that the kondo singlet under this measurement ( denoted by @xmath167 ) evolves into the state @xmath34 as @xmath168 where the two coefficients @xmath169 and @xmath170 satisfy the relation @xmath171 with its relaxation rate @xmath159 being equivalent to the one obtained in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_rel ] ) : @xmath172    an important point from our observation is that the present charge detection process should not be considered as an irreversible phase randomization which may be present because of some uncontrollable degrees of freedom .",
    "as described above , cross - correlation measurements can be used to recover the interference and therefore clarify that it can not be attributed to irreversible phase randomization .",
    "another kind of interferometer+detector setup has also been investigated that is able to confirm this point of view  @xcite .",
    "we have described the kondo singlet in a quantum dot entangled with a mesoscopic charge detector . without any ` measurement ' on the detector ,",
    "the ` coherence ' of the kondo singlet is reduced .",
    "the dephasing rate is sensitive to the charge - state information encoded both in the magnitude and in the phase of the scattering coefficients of the detector .",
    "a detector model is introduced to account for the two different contributions of dephasing and to provide a possible solution to a recent experimental puzzle  @xcite . in the case",
    "that projective measurements are performed on the detector electrodes , the kondo singlet is disentangled from the detector state . in this case , the kondo singlet evolves into a particular state with a fixed number of electrons in the quantum dot .",
    "its relaxation rate is shown to be sensitive only to the qd - charge dependence of the transmission probability in the detector .",
    "this implies that the phase information is erased in the conditional evolution process .",
    "this kind of relaxation can be investigated by a cross - correlation measurement on the two output electrodes , one from the kondo system and the other from the detector .",
    "here we discuss the relation between the scattering matrix and the translation of a 1d potential , and derive equation  ( [ eq : delta - phi ] ) .",
    "first , let us consider an arbitrary 1d potential @xmath173 that leads to the corresponding scattering matrix @xmath174 then the wave function @xmath175 for the electron initially injected from @xmath176 can be written as ( at the asymptotic region ) @xmath177 where @xmath8 is the wave number of the electron .",
    "now assume that the potential is shifted by @xmath115 , that is , the potential is given as @xmath178 where @xmath179 .",
    "it is obvious that the wave function in the shifted potential @xmath180 has the same form with @xmath175 given in equation  ( [ eq : psi-1d ] ) .",
    "that is , @xmath181 using the original coordinate @xmath182 instead of @xmath183 , one can find that @xmath184 where @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "in other words , the transmission amplitude is invariant under translation of the potential , but the reflection amplitude suffers phase shift of @xmath187 .",
    "applying the result derived here for discussion of phase - sensitive dephasing in section 3.4 , we get equation  ( [ eq : delta - phi ] ) .",
