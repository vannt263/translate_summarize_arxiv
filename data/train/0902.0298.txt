    "rare charmless nonleptonic b meson decays provide us with a lot of information on weak interactions of quarks and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "yet , since quarks are forever confined , this information is necessarily blended with strong interaction effects .",
    "additionally , there may be contributions from new physics beyond the standard model .",
    "since this new physics is by definition unknown , proper disentangling of all three effects requires a thorough understanding of the strong interaction part .",
    "unfortunately , the calculation of low - energy quark - confining strong interaction effects from first principles is at present impossible .",
    "consequently , the only way to achieve a reliable understanding of these effects is through their parametrization and subsequent extraction of relevant parameters from the experimental data .",
    "for example , simple quark - level arguments suggest that the ratio @xmath4 of the so - called colour - suppressed ( @xmath5 ) and tree ( @xmath6 ) diagrammatic amplitudes ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) should be small . yet , since the time of the theoretically clean analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , it is known that the effective tree and colour - suppressed amplitudes in @xmath7 decays are roughly equal in absolute magnitudes , thus contradicting simple quark - level expectations .",
    "hence , additional quark - level @xcite and/or hadron - level @xcite effects must be important .    in fact , as various authors have argued , the effective tree ( @xmath8 ) and colour - suppressed ( @xmath9 ) amplitudes involve contributions from penguin diagrams as well ( see eg .",
    "@xcite ) . disentangling this ` second ' penguin contribution from the ` true ' @xmath5 and @xmath6 amplitudes is not possible on the basis of @xmath7 data alone .",
    "for this reason , ref.@xcite considered @xmath10 decays in conjunction with @xmath11 and @xmath12 processes . since under very reasonable assumptions it may be shown that both @xmath0 and @xmath13 processes depend on the _ same _ _ ratio _ of @xmath4 , the number of equations constraining @xmath4 increases , thereby enabling extraction of the latter from the data . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was then shown that the data allow a solution for @xmath4 which is in agreement with the simple quark - level expectations .    alternatively , one may supplement the data on @xmath7 decays with those on @xmath2 .",
    "this was the route attempted in ref .",
    "the problem with that route is that one has to know how to treat @xmath3 breaking .    in this paper , we analyse @xmath0 and @xmath2 decays in conjunction with @xmath14 processes , and under a specific assumption concerning the pattern of @xmath3 breaking .",
    "the assumption on @xmath3 breaking adopted by us has been experimentally known to be correct since the mid - seventies of the last century .",
    "we show that the data on @xmath15 point then unambiguously toward a small @xmath16 ratio , of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 our main definitions and conventions",
    "are set and the basic analysis of the @xmath7 sector @xcite is repeated with the new , more precise data .",
    "section 3 contains the analysis of the @xmath18 decays .",
    "this involves a regge estimate of @xmath3 breaking in the hadronization stage , which is crucial in bringing the extracted value of @xmath16 into agreement with the expectations .",
    "we conclude in section 4 .",
    "below we employ the notation used in ref . @xcite .",
    "the diagrammatic approach gives the following expressions for the amplitudes in the @xmath10 decays : @xmath19 where we have kept the leading terms only , i.e. the contributions from effective tree @xmath8 , colour - suppressed tree @xmath9 , and penguin amplitudes @xmath20 .",
    "the effective amplitudes present in eq .",

    "if @xmath56 is not neglected , then  as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite  using information on @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays and making a very reasonable physical assumption concerning the creation of the @xmath60 pair in the final hadronization process , one can try to extract the true ratio @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that there exists a solution with a small value of @xmath16 ( of the order of 0.3 ) .",
    "extraction of @xmath4 is thus possible with the help of additional information available from other data .",
    "the method of ref .",
    "@xcite uses for that purpose the data on @xmath61 . under the assumption of exact @xmath3",
    "it shows that the true @xmath4 may indeed be small .",
    "however , when a specific way of @xmath3 breaking is considered , ref.@xcite predicts significantly increased central values of @xmath4 ( albeit the corresponding errors also increase ) .",
    "the problem with the method of ref .",
    "@xcite is that it assumes either exact @xmath3 , or - as we will show - an inadequate estimate of @xmath3 breaking . in the following ,",
    "we show how @xmath3 breaking in the hadronization stage should be included , and how this affects the discussion of the tree and penguin amplitudes ( other studies of @xmath61 decays may be found in refs @xcite ) . in order to present the problem with @xmath3 breaking clearly , it is appropriate to consider two different but closely related pure penguin processes , i.e. the decays @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and to discuss them in conjunction .",
    "when compared with the @xmath0 amplitudes , the @xmath14 amplitude differs in that it is now an @xmath66 quark and not a @xmath67 or @xmath36 quark that is being produced .",
    "the relevant difference enters through the ckm factors @xmath68 only . when @xmath68 s are factored out",

    "thus , the @xmath14 amplitude is given by @xmath72 when the ratio of @xmath73 is expressed in terms of @xmath74 , one obtains @xmath75 where @xmath76 and the factor of @xmath77 takes care of the suppression of the term @xmath78 when compared to @xmath79 ( eq . ( [ pqdef ] ) ) .",
    "it is convenient to introduce @xmath80 so that @xmath81 for @xmath82 one then expects @xmath83      in the @xmath3 symmetric case , the @xmath2 amplitude is given by @xmath21 of eq .",
    "( [ ppipi ] ) : @xmath85 we know , however , that @xmath3 is broken .",
    "the main difference between the @xmath14 and @xmath86 amplitudes stems then from the fact that in the first decay the @xmath60 pair created after the weak decay is composed of light quarks , while in the other decay it is an @xmath87 pair .",

    "for example , in @xcite it was argued , in a qcd - based model , that factorization in @xmath97 decays to two pseudoscalars holds exactly at the leading order .",
