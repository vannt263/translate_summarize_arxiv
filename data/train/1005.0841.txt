    "the standard model ( sm ) has deep theoretical puzzles that hint toward the existence of a more fundamental microscopic theory .",
    "first , the sm fermions exhibit very special patterns of yukawa couplings ; the origin of these `` flavor spurions '' is unknown .",
    "another central question concerns the hierarchy between the fermi and planck scales .",
    "supersymmetry offers a very attractive mechanism for stabilizing @xmath1 , but does not explain its origin",
    ". fits to precision electroweak data suggest a weakly coupled higgs and in the sm its mass is a free parameter whose origin is unknown .",
    "there are various solutions to each of these problems separately , but the different mechanisms are in general hard to combine .",
    "nevertheless , trying to find a single unified framework addressing these puzzles can reveal new connections between flavor , supersymmetry breaking and higgs physics , as well as providing windows into high energy physics .",
    "based on  @xcite , the authors of  @xcite proposed a realistic `` single - sector '' model where the dynamics that explains the texture of fermion masses also breaks supersymmetry .",
    "the confining dynamics is given by supersymmetric qcd with fundamental flavors plus a field in the adjoint representation , in the free magnetic phase .",
    "the hierarchies in the yukawa matrices are explained by postulating that the first and second sm generations are composite mesons of different uv dimensions , while the third generation is elementary .",
    "supersymmetry is broken dynamically using a variant of the mechanism found by intriligator , seiberg and shih ( iss )  @xcite .",
    "the model is fully calculable and realistic , avoids flavor problems and produces a low energy spectrum similar to the `` more minimal '' supersymmetric sm of  @xcite .",
    "the original motivation of this work was to study the higgs sector that could arise in the single sector models of  @xcite .",
    "however , the dynamical mechanism that we found turns out to be quite generic and simple , and can be applied to theories with a flavor sector different from the one in  @xcite .",
    "we will argue that sqcd with fundamental flavors in the free magnetic phase has the required structure to produce a composite higgs model that breaks the electroweak symmetry dynamically and calculably , and naturally solves the @xmath0 problem .",
    "therefore , the first part of the paper (  [ sec : compositeh ] and  [ sec : dewsb ] ) will be devoted to presenting the mechanism for dynamical ewsb in its simplest and minimal form , independently of the flavor sector .",
    "the precise low energy phenomenology at the tev scale depends on the spectrum and couplings to the ( supersymmetric ) sm particles , a well - known example being the sensitivity of the higgs to top / stop effects . in the second part of the work ( starting from  [ sec : ssector ] )",
    ", we will show how our proposal naturally combines with the single sector models of  @xcite , yielding a unified and realistic explanation for flavor , supersymmetry breaking and higgs physics .",
    "the model has various interesting properties , stemming from the fact that the strong dynamics responsible for the breaking of @xmath2 also produces the fermion masses and mixings and breaks supersymmetry .",
    "for instance , the ew scale is tied to the supersymmetry scale via a coupling which is also responsible for producing the yukawa interactions .",
    "the @xmath3 term is related to the scale of r - symmetry breaking and gaugino masses .",
    "the rg evolution of the theory down to the tev scale presents various special features , studied in  [ sec : eft ] . ",
    "[ sec : pheno ] presents the low energy phenomenology and a scan over parameter space , with particular emphasis on the nature of the nlsp . before proceeding ,",
    "it is useful to summarize the basic ideas and present an overview of the model .",
    "strongly coupled gauge theories have a very elegant mechanism for generating exponentially small hierarchies , @xmath4 both dynamical supersymmetry breaking and technicolor exploit this fact . in the latter case , the electroweak scale is generated by identifying the higgs field with a technifermion bilinear @xmath5 which condenses due to nonperturbative effects from a technicolor gauge group @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "technicolor constructions generically face the problem of new strongly coupled dynamics close to the tev scale .",
    "some of the difficulties are overcome if the physical dimension of @xmath7 is close to one ( e.g. walking technicolor ) , although this limit is also somewhat problematic .",
    "unitarity implies that @xmath7 must become free when its dimension is equal to one , but in 4d it is challenging to find a realistic technicolor theory supporting weakly coupled subsectors .",
    "furthermore , the operator @xmath8 becomes relevant and the hierarchy and fine - tuning problems reappear .",
    "these points can in principle be resolved in a supersymmetric context .",
    "weakly coupled subsectors are quite common in supersymmetric confining gauge theories  the simplest being sqcd in the free magnetic phase . and , of course , one of the main motivations for supersymmetry is that it stabilizes the fermi scale , making the theory natural up to extremely high scales .",
    "our goal ( in  [ sec : compositeh ] and  [ sec : dewsb ] ) is to construct a supersymmetric model admitting a weakly coupled description at long distances , that breaks @xmath2 and supersymmetry dynamically .",
    "our main example for the short distance theory is sqcd with gauge group @xmath9 and @xmath10 fundamental flavors @xmath11 in the free magnetic range @xmath12 , the `` electric theory '' . the low energy theory admits a dual `` magnetic '' description in terms of weakly coupled mesons and baryons , and has a large unbroken symmetry group .",
    "after weakly gauging a subgroup and identifying it with the sm gauge group , one of the higgs fields will arise from the composite meson , @xmath13 the magnetic description implies that the dimension of @xmath7 approaches 1 in the ir . furthermore , chiral symmetries and supersymmetry forbid explicit mass terms",
    "the role of the technifermion bilinear is now played by a scalar ( superfield ) bilinear .",
    "more precisely , we postulate that the up - type higgs @xmath14 is an elementary field , while @xmath15 arises as a composite meson in the sqcd theory in short , a `` hybrid higgs '' sector .",
    "other components of this meson field break supersymmetry as in  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic theory is described by an oraifeartaigh model ( with composite messengers and direct mediation ) plus interactions between the higgs fields and dimension two messenger operators @xmath16 .",
    "the superpotential has the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the oraifeartaigh fields . in our proposal ,",
    "the coupling @xmath19 is dictated by seiberg duality , with @xmath20 . on the other hand ,",
    "the interactions of the elementary @xmath14 with the supersymmetry breaking fields are generated by deforming the microscopic theory with an operator @xmath21 that is irrelevant in the uv .",
    "while the dimension of @xmath14 is always close to one , at long distance @xmath22 will flow to a dimension 2 operator .",
    "this generates a marginal coupling with a naturally small @xmath23 .",
    "we will argue that this low energy description of sqcd has the correct structure to simultaneously break supersymmetry and the electroweak symmetry .",
    "the dynamical breaking is produced , in the magnetic description , by the coleman - weinberg mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis that @xmath14 is elementary and @xmath15 is composite provides a simple explanation for the following points :    * the hierarchy between the top and bottom / tau masses is generated naturally if @xmath15 is composite ( as well as part of the sm matter ) , while @xmath14 is still taken to be elementary .",
    "* @xmath15 will have parametrically large mixings with the supersymmetry breaking sector that lead to @xmath24 .",
    "as observed in  @xcite , this helps to solve the @xmath0 problem .    from a bottom - up perspective , this possibility appeared e.g. in the more minimal scenarios of  @xcite , and its relevance for the @xmath0 problem was recently understood in  @xcite .",
    "recall that minimizing the tree level higgs potential requires @xmath25 generically in gauge - mediated models , the tree - level @xmath3 and @xmath26 are forbidden , e.g. by a pq symmetry , and are dynamically generated at one - loop , implying that @xmath27 .",
    "this entails however , that there is no natural solution to the above relations ( [ higgsvac ] ) .",
    "the mass hierarchy generated in the magnetic theory ( [ eq : introw ] ) on the other hand is @xmath28 and , at the origin of field space , @xmath29 , triggers ewsb .",
    "@xcite argued that for adequate scalings of the soft parameters , the hierarchy ( [ eq : intro - hierarchy ] ) provides a viable solution to ( [ higgsvac ] ) .",
    "the theory has an approximate r - symmetry under which the oraifeartaigh ( tree level ) flat direction and @xmath15 have r - charge 2 , while @xmath14 has charge -2 .",
    "this forbids a supersymmetric @xmath3-term and majorana gaugino masses .",
    "the r - symmetry will be broken using the mechanism of  @xcite , producing realistic gaugino and higgsino masses .",
    "our proposal realizes some of the ideas of  @xcite and especially  @xcite in a rather generic sqcd setup .",
    "generating dynamically the electroweak scale does not in principle explain the pattern of masses and mixings of the sm fermions .",
    "we adopt the point of view that the same mechanism responsible for breaking @xmath2 should also produce the correct flavor textures . starting from  [ sec : ssector ] ,",
    "the connection between flavor physics and the ew scale is established by combining the hybrid higgs theory with the single sector models of  @xcite .",
    "we add a field @xmath30 transforming in the adjoint of the electric gauge group , with a renormalizable @xmath31 superpotential .",
    "the theory confines at a scale @xmath32 and generates two types of mesons , @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "the first sm generation is identified with components of the dimension 3 meson , the second generation and @xmath15 arise from the dimension 2 meson , while @xmath14 and the third generation fields are elementary .",
    "yukawa couplings are generated at a scale @xmath35 from superpotential couplings between the mesons and higgs fields .",
    "such operators are irrelevant before the theory confines and become marginal in the infrared .",
    "therefore , different yukawa couplings are proportional to different powers of the small ratio @xmath36 and the correct yukawa textures are generated .",
    "the down - type yukawas are produced at a higher order in @xmath37 , explaining the smallness of @xmath38 dynamically .    in models where unification is possible ,",
    "the dynamical scale @xmath32 is approximately @xmath39 ; otherwise it could be smaller . in the class of models analyzed here",
    ", achieving unification is difficult .",
    "it would be interesting to consider scenarios where this is naturally realized .",
    "the scale @xmath40 is roughly an order of magnitude above @xmath32 , so that @xmath41 generates the correct yukawa couplings .",
    "supersymmetry is now broken by one linear combination of the two mesons , denoted by @xmath42 , which acquires a linear term in the superpotential . from the ir point of view",
    "this is again the iss mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the model produces composite messengers ; composite sm fields couple strongly to the supersymmetry breaking sector and acquire ( large ) one loop masses . on the other hand ,",
    "elementary fields acquire their masses predominantly from two loop ( direct ) gauge mediation . in summary ,",
    "* the first and second generation sfermions and @xmath15 have masses @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the f - term of the tree level flat direction @xmath42 , and the messenger masses are of order @xmath45 . *",

    "models with inverted hierarchies and a hybrid higgs sector have quite distinct properties , that are studied using a combination of effective potential methods and mssm rges .",
    "this will allow us to explicitly obtain the weak scale in terms of the microscopic parameters .",
    " [ sec : pheno ] presents more detailed spectra and parameter ranges , and various explicit computations are shown in the appendix .",
    "in this section and in  [ sec : dewsb ] we present a composite higgs model that breaks supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry dynamically and calculably .",
    "the confining dynamics comes from @xmath9 sqcd with fundamental flavors , in the free magnetic range .",
    "the theory will be analyzed using its weakly coupled description , which we review in  [ subsec : e - m ] .",
    "the aim is to explain in a simple setup the dynamical mechanism relating supersymmetry breaking to the fermi scale .",
    "it will be argued that this naturally solves the @xmath0 problem , along the lines of  @xcite .    as summarized above , in  [ sec : ssector ] an extra field transforming in the adjoint of the electric gauge group will be added , in order to generate the standard model flavor hierarchies .",
    "this modifies the uv properties of the theory , but the long distance description of the electroweak and supersymmetry breaking sectors will be the same as the one for the simpler model analyzed here .      before introducing the higgs sector , we start with a brief review of  @xcite .",
    "the microscopic theory is sqcd with gauge group @xmath9 and @xmath10 flavors @xmath50 in the free magnetic range @xmath51 , with masses @xmath52 , @xmath53 the quark masses are ordered @xmath54 for @xmath55 , and are chosen to be much smaller than the dynamical scale @xmath32 .",
    "this may be generated dynamically , as in  @xcite .",
    "as will be explained shortly , these different quark masses will be required to ensure the stability of our vacuum , which will differ from the iss model by the addition of extra singlets .",
    "furthermore , at least 5 mass eigenvalues have to be equal , so that there is an unbroken @xmath56 global symmetry that can be identified with the sm gauge group . for our purposes , it will be sufficient to have two different eigenvalues , @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "the non - anomalous global symmetries are then @xmath59 where @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) have charge @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) under the baryon numer @xmath64 .",
    "we weakly gauge a subgroup of the global symmetry group and identify it with the standard model gauge group , @xmath65 we will find it convenient to use an @xmath56 `` gut notation '' as a shorthand for the sm quantum numbers , but no assumption of unification is made .",
    "furthermore , in the realistic models of  [ sec : ssector ] , baryon number @xmath64 is automatically gauged ; this has the advantage of removing a nambu - goldstone boson from the low energy theory .",
    "below the scale @xmath32 , the theory has a dual magnetic description  @xcite in terms of an sqcd theory with gauge group @xmath66 , singlet mesons @xmath67 , and @xmath10 fundamental flavors @xmath68 .",
    "the theory is weakly coupled in the infrared and has superpotential @xmath69 the magnetic and electric variables are related by @xmath70 we choose the superpotential parameters to be real .",
    "the magnetic superpotential of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmag1 ] ) ( as well as the one in ",
    "[ sec : ssector ] ) receives nonperturbative corrections which , in the regime @xmath71 , do not affect our results .",
    "the model has a classical r - symmetry under which @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "this symmetry , which becomes anomalous at the quantum level , will play an important role in what follows .",
    "recall also that @xmath64 is gauged to remove a ng boson .",
    "intriligator , seiberg and shih ( iss )  @xcite have argued that sqcd , in the free magnetic phase , with small quark masses flows to a weakly coupled o raifeartaigh model , thus giving a calculable model with dynamical supersymmetry breaking .",
    "this can be seen from the classical magnetic superpotential eq .",
    "( [ eq : wmag1 ] ) , which breaks supersymmetry by the rank condition , giving nonzero f - terms @xmath74 parametrizing the fields as @xmath75 @xmath76 ( where @xmath77 is the rank of the magnetic gauge group ) @xmath42 is flat at tree level ( `` pseudo - modulus '' ) , while @xmath78 the minimum corresponds to aligning the nonzero expectation value in the direction @xmath79 of the largest linear term , while the supersymmetry breaking scale is set by the smaller @xmath80 .",
    "the expectation value for @xmath81 completely breaks the magnetic gauge group , leaving @xmath82 the fields from @xmath83 are supersymmetric at tree level and will not be important in what follows .",

    "nonperturbative effects , which have been neglected here , create supersymmetric vacua . as long as @xmath93 ,",
    "the metastable vacuum is parametrically long lived .",
    "notice that the @xmath94 symmetry is unbroken ; in  [ subsec : mu ] the superpotential will be deformed and the r - symmetry will be broken explicitly and spontaneously  @xcite .      in order to generate the small ratio @xmath95 dynamically , we postulate that some of the higgs fields arise as composites of the sqcd theory introduced before .",
    "we take @xmath14 to be an elementary field , while @xmath15 is generated from the meson @xmath96 . in the weakly coupled magnetic description",
    "the dynamical breaking of @xmath2 will be fully calculable , arising as a tree level plus one loop effect .",
    "after weakly gauging the sm gauge group , the mesons @xmath96 contain @xmath97 representations , which have the correct quantum numbers for a higgs field .",
    "the global symmetry is broken to ( [ eq : symm ] ) and @xmath98 is embedded into the unbroken subgroup @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath15 is identified with a @xmath99 component from @xmath42 , @xmath100 it is important that this element comes from an off - diagonal component of the meson that does not have a tree level f - term .",

    "@xcite then suggests that the higgsino - like nlsp should decay mostly to @xmath92 s .",
    "the detailed structure of decays and final states depends also on the mass splitting between the lightest neutralino and chargino .    on the other hand , the case of sneutrino nlsp",
    "is also of particular interest , as this is not easy to realize in perturbative scenarios . for the region of parameters that we studied , and computing the masses using tree level (",
    "soft plus higgs induced mass terms ) and one loop rg effects , whenever a slepton was the nlsp , it was the sneutrino .",
    "this intriguing possibility has been recently studied in  @xcite .",
    "this might seem surprising at first sight , because the gauge mediated slepton mass @xmath486 ( which determines the sneutrino mass eigenvalue ) is larger than @xmath487 .",

    "it is rather intriguing that the complicated structure of the mssm can originate from a quite simple microscopic theory .",
    "it is necessary to point out that , since the electric theory is vector - like , it suffers from the existence of extra matter near the compositeness scale .",
    "we have not addressed this aspect here , because it does not affect the ew effective theory or the soft parameters .",
    "it would be useful to understand better their role , and to find models where unification occurs naturally .",
    "the theory at the tev scale also exhibits an interesting phenomenology , which we have begun to explore in this work .",
    "a striking feature is that a small number of microscopic couplings controls all the soft parameters and ew scale ; this produces nontrivial relations between the mssm sectors , that can also vary along the parameter space of the model .",
    "we have restricted to the case where the cubic couplings produced by seiberg duality are all of the same order of magnitude , @xmath488 .",

    "we find that composite fields give small contributions to the running of @xmath161 and @xmath558 , the reason being a ( partial ) cancellation of the effects from @xmath559 and inter - generational mixing .",
    "the effect on @xmath560 is slightly larger , but still at the percent level .",
    "on the other hand , there are strong effects on the running slepton mass , because the boundary soft mass is smaller , and contributions from @xmath559 and off - diagonal yukawas now add up .",

    "[ subsec : comp - scale ] .      in models with heavy first and/or second generations at the multi - tev scale",

    "we now estimate such contributions in our context .    the two loop mssm rges can be found in the second reference of  @xcite .",
    "for example , the two loop contribution to the beta function for the third generation slepton is ( excluding a factor of @xmath561 ) @xmath562 smaller contributions from yukawas have been neglected , and @xmath563    here we already made the simplifying assumptions appropriate in our context , that the first two generations give the dominant contribution and that , approximately their masses are degenerate .",

    "two loop contributions tend to decrease the soft masses .",
    "evaluating these effects in our range of parameters ( where composites have mass @xmath565 tev ) , the two loop correction to the stop squared mass is found to be approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the one loop effects we have included .",
    "these effects are also in general small for sleptons , except in the regime where the nlsp is the sneutrino . in this case",
    "they become important , and it would be interesting to understand better how they modify the properties of the nlsp . we leave this for future work .",
    "in our proposal , supersymmetry breaking and ewsb have a unified origin , so it is interesting to understand how sensitive the vacuum @xmath566 is to changes in the microscopic parameters ( denoted below by ` @xmath527 ' ) .",
    "the basic naturalness criterion , given for instance in  @xcite , is that @xmath567 should not be too large .",
    "( we refer the reader to  @xcite for a bottom - up analysis of tuning over the mssm parameter space , and for references . )",
    "this places upper bounds on the masses of heavy superpartners , so the first worry is that heavy composite generations require un - naturally large cancellations .",
    "however , this is not the case because the higgs mass is quite insensitive to quantum effects from such particles ; this was found in  @xcite , and can be seen directly from the smallness of the coefficient @xmath568 in ( [ eq : analytic - mh ] ) .",
    "this equation also shows that @xmath161 is quite insensitive to the heavy higgs as well in fact , there are partial cancellations between both effects .",
    "composite masses of the order @xmath569 give a ( mild ) fine - tuning of order @xmath570 .",
    "the higgs vev is most sensitive to the masses of the stop and @xmath14 .",
    "naively , having a stop around @xmath571 , as is the case in many of the examples above , leads to a fine tuning generally much larger than a part in 100 . however , this low energy estimate is not completely correct , because the soft masses at the tev scale are correlated , all being determined by a few microscopic parameters ( @xmath572 ) .",
    "this tends to reduce the amount of fine - tuning .",
    "furthermore , the solution ( [ eq : analytic - mh ] ) reveals that the influence of the stop is somewhat smaller than expected .",
    "the total fine - tuning measure in the range of ( [ eq : good - range ] ) is slightly below the percent level , so that the model is somewhat tuned .",
    "the underlying reason for this is the rather strong assumption that a single - sector dynamics be simultaneously responsible for the ew scale , soft parameters and flavor textures .",

    "<S> the model , based on a confining sqcd theory , breaks supersymmetry and electroweak symmetry dynamically and calculably . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneously solves the @xmath0 problem and explains the smallness of the bottom and tau masses compared to the top mass . the proposal </S>",
    "<S> is then applied to a class of models where the same confining dynamics is used to generate the standard model flavor hierarchy by quark and lepton compositeness . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a unified framework for flavor , supersymmetry breaking and electroweak physics . </S>",
    "<S> the weakly coupled dual is used to explicitly compute the mssm parameters in terms of a few microscopic couplings , giving interesting relations between the electroweak and soft parameters . the rg evolution down to the tev scale is obtained and salient phenomenological predictions of this class of `` single - sector '' models are discussed .    0 </S>"
