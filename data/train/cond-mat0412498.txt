    "a variety of remarkable recent low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) observations have revealed periodic modulations in the local density of states of the cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "notably , the observations of hanaguri _ et al _",
    "@xcite ca@xmath5na@xmath6cuo@xmath7cl@xmath7 clearly show that the modulations have a commensurate period of 4 lattice spacings along both directions of the underlying square lattice ( @xmath4 ordering ) .",
    "closely related , but not identical , modulations have been observed in higher temperature stm @xcite , and in neutron scattering @xcite observations .",
    "the differences between the various experiments relate ( _ i _ ) to the period of the ordering , which is incommensurate in ref .  , and ( _ ii _ ) to whether the ordering extends along one or both of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes ",
    "neutron scattering experiments are more easily explained by anisotropic ordering along one of the axes directions @xcite .",
    "an important open question is whether these differences reflect a fundamental distinction in the underlying electronic structure of the cuprates , or they can be explained by the differing experimental parameters of temperature and carrier concentration .",
    "this paper will begin with the assumption that at very low @xmath10 , for a small range of carrier densities , and in a sufficiently clean sample , the system has perfect @xmath4 density wave order ( and , more generally , @xmath0 order with @xmath1 , integer ) .",
    "we will then present a general phenomenological theory of the effect of thermal fluctuations on such an ordered state , describing the phases that appear at higher @xmath10 and for a wide range of carrier concentration . because we focus exclusively on thermal fluctuations , our results are quite general and independent of the precise microscopic nature of the density wave ordering",
    "; in particular , the ordering could be a site charge density wave , or a modulation in exchange or pairing energies due to valence bond solid order .",
    "our results depend only on the fact that spin - singlet observables acquire a periodic modulation at low @xmath10 , and follow completely from the symmetry properties of such states .",
    "the thermal fluctuations of such an ordered state can , and will , be described by a purely classical theory of the density wave order parameters .    there is a actually large early literature on the melting of a variety to two - dimensional solids on different substrates , and on the commensurate - incommensurate transition @xcite",
    ". however , most of this work considered the case of the triangular solid on substrates with six - fold symmetry , or the commensurate - incommensurate transition on anisotropic solids . the particular case of interest here , a square lattice substrate and isotropic @xmath0 ordering , appears not to have been considered previously .",
    "we will therefore present an extension of this earlier theory to the situation appropriate for the cuprate superconductors . as we will show below ,",
    "our results have a number of novel features not found in the cases studied earlier .",
    "we will begin in section  [ sec : mft ] by defining the order parameters of the commensurate @xmath0 solid on the square lattice .",
    "symmetry considerations then allow us to obtain a phenomenological free energy density controlling thermal fluctuations of the order parameter , and a corresponding mean field phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figmft ] .     in eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) .",
    "although all parameters in @xmath11 are functions of both temperature and carrier concentration , the vertical axis above , @xmath12 , is primarily a function of temperature .",
    "the horizontal axis is tuned by @xmath13 , which is mainly a measure of carrier concentration away from the commensurate value appropriate to the @xmath14 ordered state .",
    "there are three stable mean field phases separated by a first order transition ( thick line ) , a second order transition ( solid line ) , and a second - order critical point at @xmath15 .",
    "the phases a , b , c , are described in the text . for phases",
    "a and b we show a schematic of the density modulation @xmath16 for the special case @xmath3 , with the points representing the underlying lattice . upon including fluctuations , the transition between phases a and b can become second - order ; in this situation the phase adjacent to phase a is a new phase b@xmath17 , the incommensurate striped phase .",
    "the phase b@xmath17 preempts a portion ( or all ) of phase b. see fig  [ figbs ] for the fluctuation - corrected phase diagram of phases a and b.,width=288 ]    at this stage , this phase diagram contains 3 phases whose characteristics we summarize below : ( a ) * commensurate solid : * this is the ground state with long - range density wave order with period @xmath2 along both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 axes .",
    "( b ) * incommensurate , floating solid : * in mean field theory , this phase has density waves with the same incommensurate period along both the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions .",
    "this order is only quasi - long - range _ i.e. _ density wave correlations decay with a power - law at long distances .",
    "( c ) * liquid : * this is the high temperature phase in which all density wave correlations decay exponentially with distance .",
    "the remainder of the paper will consider fluctuation corrections to this mean field phase diagram .    in mean field theory , the transition between phases a and b is first order , with a jump in the period of the density wave from a commensurate to an incommensurate value .",
    "we know from previous work on anisotropic phases @xcite that such commensurate - incommensurate transitions are driven by the proliferation of domain walls , and we consider the domain wall theory for such a transition in section  [ sec : domains ] . in our case",
    "there are two sets of domain walls , running predominantly in the @xmath8 and @xmath9 directions , and a key parameter will be the intersection energy , @xmath18 , of these domain walls . if @xmath19 , then the mean field prediction of a first order transition to an isotropic floating solid is maintained .",
    "however , for the case of a positive intersection energy ( @xmath20 ) , we will demonstrate that there is a second order transition to an anisotropic , incommensurate `` striped '' state , which we denote b@xmath17 .",
    "the b@xmath17 state has commensurate long range order with a period of @xmath2 lattice along one axis , and incommensurate quasi - long - range order along the orthogonal axis . because b@xmath17 has long - range order only along one direction ,",
    "it may also be labelled a ` smectic ' @xcite ; however the presence of the underlying lattice makes its fluctuations quite different from a conventional smectic liquid crystal .",
    "the striped solid b@xmath17 will replace a portion of phase b , so that b@xmath17 covers at least the entire second - order phase boundary to phase a ( see fig  [ figbs ] ) .",
    "the remainder of phase b could remain an isotropic floating solid , or it could be anisotropic in its entirety .    section  [ sec : floating ] will consider the transitions from the incommensurate states in phase b to the disordered liquid c. two distinct scenarios are possible , depending upon the whether the transition takes place from an isotropic floating solid b , or from the anisotropic solid ( b@xmath17 ) which has incommensurate order along only one axis . in either case , the transition is driven by the unbinding of dislocations @xcite , and the complete theory for such transitions will be presented .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : dual ] will present the theory of the direct transition from the commensurate @xmath0 solid a to the liquid state c. from fig .",
    "[ figmft ] it appears that such a transition is only possible at special commensurate values of the density . for the physically relevant case of @xmath3 we will find that a direct second order transition is possible .",
    "it is described by a self - dual theory with continuously varying exponents , and is a generalization of the theory found in ref .   for the xy model .",
    "as noted in section  [ sec : intro ] , all phases and transitions examined here are associated with the order of a generic ` density ' , which could be any observable invariant under spin rotations and time reversal .",
    "we represent this density by @xmath21 . at sufficiently low temperatures , in weak disorder , and for some range of carrier concentration , we assume that this density prefers to order with a period of @xmath2 lattice spacings ( @xmath3 is the case of interest for the cuprates )",

    "we now want to write down the most general free energy for @xmath25 consistent with the symmetries of the underlying lattice . among these",
    "are @xmath26 which translate by a lattice spacing in the @xmath27 directions , and @xmath28 which reflect the @xmath27 axes .",

    "we can now write down the most general free energy density , expanded in powers of @xmath25 and its gradients , consistent with the symmetries in eqs .",

    "it indicates that at sufficiently high temperature , the density correlations are generically _ incommensurate_. this incommensurability is a consequence of the values of the domain wall energies between the @xmath2 commensurate ordered states @xcite : a domain wall between state 1 and state 2 ( say ) will generally have a different energy than a domain wall between state 1 and state @xmath2 . in other words , if we represent the @xmath2 states along one direction by a @xmath2 state clock model , then the interactions of the clock model are ` chiral ' .",
    "@xcite    the sign of the parameter @xmath33 implies a preference for either isotropic order ( @xmath34 prefers both @xmath35 and @xmath36 non - zero ) , or anisotropic order ( @xmath37 prefers only one of @xmath35 or @xmath38 non - zero ) .",
    "we will assume throughout this paper that @xmath34 , so that @xmath35 and @xmath36 are both non - zero at sufficiently low temperatures .",
