    "high finesse optical resonators can improve the sensitivity of atom detection by increasing the lifetime of photons and confining them to a small volume @xcite .",
    "long photon lifetime , controlled by cavity length and mirror reflectivity , increases the effective optical thickness of an intra - cavity sample by a factor on the order of the finesse @xmath4 .",
    "small mode volume , which depends only on the geometry of the resonator , increases the energy density per photon and therefore the einstein coefficients describing transition rates .",

    "the radiative behaviour can be coherent @xcite .",
    "although the gas may be dilute , the common coupling to the electromagnetic field produces effective long - range interactions between the atoms that can lead to self - organisation @xcite and collective motion @xcite , as well as super - radiant rayleigh scattering and collective atomic recoil lasing @xcite .",
    "recently experimenters have exploited these effects to realise a quantum phase transition from a bose - einstein condensate to a supersolid @xcite .",
    "a central parameter in describing cavity - enhanced detection is the dimensionless single - atom cooperativity @xcite , , where @xmath5 is the single - photon rabi frequency at the peak of the cavity intensity distribution , @xmath6 is the cavity linewidth ( full - width at half maximum ) , and @xmath7 is the natural atomic linewidth .",
    "the cooperativity determines both the effect of a single atom on the cavity spectrum , and the rate of fluorescence into the cavity .    in the case of multiple atoms ,",
    "the cooperativity is generalized by defining @xmath8 , where the effective atom number is @xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 being the atomic density , @xmath11 the cavity length , and @xmath12 $ ] the cavity field mode function ( @xmath13 is the wavelength ) .",

    "since @xmath50 fluctuates over repeated experiments , the photon counts obey @xmath52 .",
    "if atoms are positioned randomly with a uniform probability distribution , the number of atoms in a given volume follows a poisson distribution and @xmath53 , independent of @xmath54 . in our experiment ,",

    "we obtain @xmath65 via the master equation for the density matrix , and use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the probability density for @xmath14 ( see methods ) .",
    "the value of @xmath66 obtained in this way is almost identical to what one obtains by simply setting @xmath67 in eq .",

    "note that for the two types of measurement the ratio @xmath71 is the same , but the nonlinearity of @xmath21 is quite different .",
    "calculations for both types of measurement , with the same @xmath15 and @xmath18 adjusted to have equal numbers of signal photons , show that the noise suppression is still much stronger for reflection .",
    "this stems from the saturation of the reflection signal at large instantaneous @xmath14 versus the roll - over of the fluorescence . for both measurements",
    "we conclude that the statistics of @xmath14 and the nonlinearity of the interactions are jointly responsible for the strong optical noise suppression that we observe .",
    "our measurements do not involve trapping single atoms within the cavity mode .",
    "however we have shown that our signal fluctuations are near the photon shot noise limit , effectively allowing us to neglect fluctuations in @xmath14 .",
    "this allows a direct comparison between our measurements on falling clouds and experiments where noise in the atom number is inherently absent due to preparation of single trapped atoms . in this context",
    "we discuss the discrete detection problem , for example distinguishing between hyperfine ground states . since the detection linewidth is three orders of magnitude smaller than the level splitting , the @xmath72 ground state is effectively dark in our system @xcite . when atom number fluctuations are suppressed , discrete detection with @xmath73 is thus equivalent to the problem of determining whether a single trapped atom fluoresces or not , which is relevant for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "we therefore take detection of @xmath73 as the benchmark for comparison with other experiments . from our fluorescence measurements at @xmath47 , we extrapolate a mean photon count rate at @xmath73 of @xmath74ms@xmath75 .",

    "this suggests the possibility of single - atom strong coupling with @xmath103 and @xmath104 in the hundreds , allowing non - destructive measurements in our system as well .",

    "similar methods were exploited in @xcite , where two photons were required within a short time window in order to register a logical 1 result . with a @xmath49s detection window they found that @xmath113 of observed 2-photon coincidences were due to atoms , and described this percentage as the fidelity . in that experiment",
    "however , there was only a @xmath114 chance that the logical 1 state would produce a 2-photon count in the detection window .",
    "thus , although the detection confidence was high , the efficiency was low , resulting in a low fidelity in the usual sense that we adopt here .",
    "we have characterized a cavity - enhanced atom detector with low noise and high spatial resolution ( set by the small cavity mode waist ) .",

    "this could improve the speed and efficiency of atom trap trace analysis , where laser - induced fluorescence is used to detect radioactive atoms for dating environmental samples over time scales not accessible with @xmath118c @xcite .",
    "finally , the compatibility of our detector with atom chips makes it attractive for studying quantum gases in the tonks - girardeau regime @xcite .",
    "producing one - dimensional gases requires trapping potentials of extremely high aspect ratio , as are typical with atom chips , and strong interactions require low densities which can be detected locally very quickly with our cavity .",

    "<S> cavity quantum electrodynamics describes the fundamental interactions between light and matter , and how they can be controlled by shaping the local environment . for example , optical microcavities allow high - efficiency detection and manipulation of single atoms . in this regime fluctuations of atom number are on the order of the mean number , which can lead to signal fluctuations in excess of the noise on the incident probe field . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , we demonstrate that nonlinearities and multi - atom statistics can together serve to suppress the effects of atomic fluctuations when making local density measurements on clouds of cold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> we measure atom densities below 1 per cavity mode volume near the photon shot - noise limit . </S>",
    "<S> this is in direct contrast to previous experiments where fluctuations in atom number contribute significantly to the noise . </S>",
    "<S> atom detection is shown to be fast and efficient , reaching fidelities in excess of @xmath0 after @xmath1s and @xmath2 after @xmath3s . </S>"
