    "when a temperature difference @xmath4 exceeding a critical value @xmath5 is applied across a thin , horizontal layer of fluid , convection occurs .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon is know as rayleigh - bnard convection ( rbc ) .",
    "the fluid flow then forms a pattern .",
    "the onset of convection is determined by the rayleigh number @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the isobaric thermal expansion coefficient , @xmath17 the acceletation of gravity , @xmath3 the thickness of the sample , @xmath18 the thermal diffusivity , and @xmath19 the kinematic viscosity .",
    "linear stability - analysis for a laterally infinite system shows that convection will occur with a critical wave number @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is measured in units of @xmath3 ) when @xmath2 exceeds @xmath22 .",
    "@xcite for the laterally infinite system the patterns that evolve beyond the onset of convection and their stability are determined by @xmath2 and by the prandtl number @xmath23 weakly nonlinear theory predicts that immediately above onset , a laterally infinite uniform system should yield a pattern consisting of parallel , straight rolls.@xcite for real experimental systems the patterns are influenced by the lateral boundaries which contain the fluid . even in these finite systems",
    "excellent approximations of the predicted ideal straight rolls of the infinite system can be found under some conditions .",
    "@xcite however , the boundaries can also lead to patterns of different symmetry .",
    "thus , by heating a thin cylindrical convection cell gently from the side in addition to heating primarily from below , a pattern of _ concentric _ rolls can be stabilized .",
    "a concentric pattern can also be the result of horizontal temperature gradients near a cylindrical side wall which are intrinsic to the particular construction of the sample cell .",
    "the concentric pattern will consist of @xmath24 rolls , where @xmath24 is an integer . of these",
    ", the one in the middle really would be more properly viewed as a convection _ cell _ , with either up - flow or down - flow in its center .",
    "it is often referred to as the umbilicus .",
    "this type of pattern , know also as a target pattern , was studied extensively by koschmieder and pallas @xcite for relatively large @xmath25 .",
    "the rolls have a mean dimensionless wave length @xmath26 where @xmath27 ( @xmath2 is the sample radius ) is the aspect ratio of the sample and where @xmath24 is the number of rolls along a radius .",
    "the corresponding wave number is @xmath28 .",
    "koschmieder and pallas found that the wave length of the rolls away from the center and the side wall increased with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "they also observed a sequence of transitions with increasing @xmath4 , each of which involved the loss of a roll at the sample center .    later work for smaller @xmath25 showed that at a certain value @xmath29 of @xmath30 the target pattern becomes unstable .",
    "@xcite the instability is known as the focus instability .",
    "@xcite how this occurs in detail depends on @xmath25 , @xmath31 , and on the nature of the confining side walls . here",
    "we describe what happens for our particular sample ( @xmath32 ) , where the side walls fixed the phase of the pattern at the radial position @xmath33 ( @xmath34 is scaled by the cell thickness @xmath3 ) . for the work of ref.@xcite ( @xmath35 )",
    "the observed phenomena were similar .",
    "as @xmath8 is increased in small steps from small values , the umbilicus shrinks .",
    "the result is a gradual decrease of the local wave numbers of the rolls away from the center .",
    "when @xmath8 is increased beyond @xmath29 , the umbilicus breaks the cylindrical symmetry by moving off center .",
    "this transition is continuous and the off - center patterns are stationary in time , but the radial umbilicus position is @xmath8 dependent . as @xmath8 is further increased , the umbilicus becomes even smaller , and then disappears at @xmath36 .",
    "at that point the pattern once more approaches a state of cylindrically symmetric rolls , although perfect rotational invariance is not fully recovered . with further increase of @xmath8 , this process repeats itself , with another roll loss at @xmath37 , and so forth .",
    "the net result is a gradual reduction with increasing @xmath8 of the wave numbers of the rolls between transitions and a discontinuous change of @xmath38 at each transition .",
    "the transitions are hysteretic , occurring at @xmath39 when @xmath4 is decreased .",
    "we studied target patterns for @xmath40 in a sample with @xmath41 using methanol with @xmath0 .",
    "we developed high - resolution numerical umbilicus - detection algorithms and determined quantitatively the umbilicus displacement @xmath42 with increasing as well as decreasing @xmath8 . at small @xmath8 the results revealed the location of the focus instability , at @xmath43 .",
    "previous measurements , @xcite for @xmath44 and a larger @xmath45 , had found the instability at lower values , near @xmath46 . over the whole @xmath8 range of our experiment the data for @xmath42 , together with measurements of an average wave number @xmath47 away from the center and the side wall , revealed eight hysteretic transitions .",
    "we observed large umbilicus displacement only for increasing @xmath8 ; for decreasing @xmath8 the hysteresis yielded transition points @xmath14 which were sufficiently low to avoid the @xmath8-range over which the umbilicus displacement was large .    for @xmath48 cross",
    "rolls @xcite formed at the outermost roll when the system was close to a transition at @xmath13 .",
    "this was particularly pronounced on the side opposite to the umbilicus displacement where the local wave lengths were exceptionally large when @xmath42 was large .",
    "nonetheless , the general nature of the pattern was maintained up to our largest @xmath8 values .",
    "for @xmath49 periodic time dependence associated with the oscillatory instability @xcite developed in the region near the cross rolls .    a complete characterization of the pattern involves a knowledge of the entire wave - director field @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the angular and @xmath34 the radial position in the sample . rather than simply measuring an average wave number along a cell diameter ( as was done in previous work",
    ") , we implemented a local wave - director analysis @xcite and determined @xmath50 .",
    "from @xmath50 we could then determine various averaged quantities , including @xmath47 .",
    "the results for @xmath47 , determined over a radius range that excluded the rolls near the center and the side wall , were discontinuous at the transitions .",
    "the hysteresis loop of each transition was traced out quantitatively .",
    "we found that the azimuthal average @xmath52 had interesting structure as a function of @xmath34 , showing different selection at the umbilicus , in the bulk of the sample , and at the cell wall .",
    "the competition between the selection mechanisms yielded a broad maximum of @xmath53 near @xmath54 . for our experimental conditions",
    "it did not yield any radially traveling waves , as predicted by tuckerman and barkley @xcite for the case of conducting side walls . as was found in previous work , @xcite the values of @xmath47 selected in the bulk were in good agreement with the predicted wave numbers for the far field of",
    "infinitely extended concentric rolls when the discontinuities at the transitions were smoothed out .",
    "we also report results for the wave numbers selected at the umbilicus and at the side wall ; but for these there seem to be no theoretical prediction .    in the next section",
    "we shall review theoretical predictions for the selection by concentric rolls and relevant previous experiments . then . in sect .",
    "[ sec : experiment ] , we shall discuss the experimental apparatus and procedures , as well as the image - analysis methods .",
    "section [ sec : results ] gives our results .",
    "it consists of a discussion of the patterns observed in various @xmath8 ranges , of a presentation of the umbilicus - displacements results , and of a presentation of our wave - number results . a brief section summarizing",
    "this work ends the paper .",
    "theoretical predictions of the wave numbers @xmath55 selected in the far field of infinitely extended target patterns have been made by several authors .",
    "@xcite for the infinite system wave - number adjustment can take place by expansion of the pattern to large distances .",
    "finite laboratory systems differ from this in an important way . the side wall , under typical experimental conditions , pins the phase of the pattern and prevents this expansion .",
    "thus , a change of the average wave number with changing @xmath8 is possible only at the umbilicus .",
    "however , also at the umbilicus unhindered phase slip is not possible .",
    "instead , a discontinuous and hysteretic process involving the destruction or creation of a convection cell occurs and leads to a discontinuous change of the wave - number field at the transition . the discontinuous effect on the average wave number decreases as the aspect ratio of the sample increases because the loss of a single cell in the center is a smaller perturbation for a larger sample .",
    "thus , even for the sample with a boundary one expects , in the large-@xmath31 limit , a continuous curve @xmath55 as a function of @xmath8 .",
    "theoretically the location of this curve is determined by the rotational symmetry of the target pattern which does not permit the mean flow that is induced by roll curvature under less symmetric conditions .",
    "thus , the mean flow must be balanced precisely by a pressure gradient.@xcite this condition leads to a unique wave number @xmath55 .",
    "initial predictions of the selected wave numbers were applicable only for small @xmath8 and are given by @xcite @xmath56 with @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 . here",
    "@xmath60 is the critical wave number at the onset of convection . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s_b ] we show @xmath61 as a function of @xmath25 .",
    "for the present work we have @xmath0 and @xmath62 .",
    "the measurements to be described below yielded the experimental value @xmath63 .",
    "this result is shown as the circle in the figure .",
    "it falls slightly above , but is generally in good agreement with , the prediction . for the work of ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath64 ) the theory yields @xmath65 , but no corresponding result has been extracted from the data .",
    "measurements for @xmath44 were reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and yielded a value for @xmath61 close to zero , but a precise number was not quoted . for that case one obtains the prediction @xmath66 , but @xmath67 changes rapidly with @xmath25 and passes through zero at @xmath68 .     in the limit of small @xmath8 as a function of the prandtl number @xmath25",
    "the circle is the result of the resent work to be discussed below.,width=321 ]    calculations valid at larger @xmath8 were made by buell and catton @xcite ( bc ) and by newell et al .",
    "@xcite using a combination of analytic and numerical methods .",
    "bc gave results for a few values of @xmath25 and @xmath2 , and we shall compare our measurements with interpolations between these predictions .",

    "are the nearby stability boundaries of infinitely extended uniform straight rolls.@xcite although in the large-@xmath25 limit it is expected that the zig - zag instability will coincide with the selected wave number,@xcite it is clear from the figure that @xmath69 is still far from that limit .    .",
    "dashed line : zigzag instability @xcite .",
    "solid line : cross - roll instability @xcite . also shown , as a dotted line , are the wave numbers predicted for the far field of infinitely extended concentric rolls @xcite .",
    "the two solid circles correspond to our experimental observation of the cross - roll instability near the side wall.,width=321 ]    to our knowledge there is as yet no prediction of the wave - number selection at the umbilicus itself .",
    "the results to be presented here show that the wave number selected there is smaller than the one in the far field .    aside from the phase",
    "pinning mentioned above , the side walls of experimental cells have an additional influence on the pattern .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed by the walls can yield a separate and competing selection mechanism.@xcite this mechanism is expected to depend on the conductivity of the side walls relative to that of the fluid , and it is not understood quantitatively for typical experimental conditions .",
    "for perfectly conducting side walls , tuckermann and barkley @xcite predicted a pattern of radially - traveling waves .",
    "the traveling nature of the pattern can be understood in terms of the competition between the selection by the curved rolls on the one hand and by the wall on the other which can lead to a wave - number gradient which in turn can lead to a non - zero time derivative of the phase of the pattern .",
    "@xcite however , to our knowledge such radially traveling waves have not yet been observed in experiments .",
    "@xcite    for @xmath25 values not too small the wave numbers predicted for curved rolls do not depend very strongly on @xmath25 .",
    "in this @xmath25 range the wave numbers of target patterns have been determined before , @xcite but to our knowledge they were never compared quantitatively with the predictions of bc .",
    "koschmieder and pallas @xcite determined a weighted average of the wave lengths of all rolls except for the outermost one . in fig .",

    "the solid line is the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath72 .",
    "aside from a lateral shift , the overall shape of a curve passing through the data is very similar to the theoretical curve .",
    "since the data do not extrapolate to @xmath73 as @xmath8 vanishes , the shift presumably is due to experimental uncertainties of the length scales involved in the determination of @xmath21 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : k_others]b we show results from ref .",
    "@xcite which were for @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these data were obtained by measuring the average wave length of 2 rolls near @xmath76 .",
    "they seem to show considerable scatter , but actually this is due to the discreteness of the values of @xmath38 which is noticeable in the figure and which becomes more apparent for this relatively small @xmath31 where the system contains only a small number of rolls . in this system",
    "hysteretic transitions were clearly observed .",

    "[ fig : k_others]c , some of the results reported by croquette and pocheau  @xcite are shown .",
    "those measurements were for @xmath78 and @xmath80 , and were obtained by measuring the average roll width along a diameter in a region away from the center and sides where the roll width appeared constant .",
    "the solid line is the numerical result @xcite for @xmath64 .",
    "the agreement clearly is very satisfying .",
    "the data do not reveal much difference when @xmath8 is increased ( open symbols ) or decreased ( solid symbols ) .",
    "the authors report observing hysteretic transitions , and thus it is somewhat surprising that this hysteresis does not manifest itself in the wave - number measurements .",
    "all of the previous investigations revealed that the roll adjacent to the side wall was exceptionally wide , but none of the prior investigations made any attempt to determine quantitatively the wave number selected at the wall or at the cell center .",
    "we used a rayleigh - bnard convection apparatus described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the top plate was a single - crystal - sapphire disk , and the bottom plate was a polished aluminum disk with a metal - film heater mounted under it to provide uniform bottom - plate heating .",
    "temperature - controlled water was circulated over the top plate .",
    "the bottom - plate temperature was controlled to create the desired temperature difference .",
    "the mean temperature was maintained at @xmath81c .",
    "for both the top and bottom plate , the temperature varied about the set temperature by less then @xmath82c .",
    "the cell wall was made of lexan ( thermal conductivity 0.23 w / m k ) with an outer diameter of 9.6 cm and an inner diameter of @xmath83 cm .",
    "a 0.012 cm diameter manganin wire was embedded in the cell wall to provide the side - wall heating .",
    "this wire had a resistance of about 13 @xmath84 , and typically dissipated 0.26 w.    the height of the side wall was 0.229 cm , though the actual fluid height @xmath3 depended on the compression of an o - ring which sealed the cell .",
    "the actual fluid height was determined by measuring @xmath5 and then inferring @xmath3 from the fluid properties and the measured @xmath85c .",
    "we found @xmath86 cm , giving an aspect ratio @xmath41 .",
    "the fluid used was methanol which , at @xmath87c , had a prandlt number @xmath0 and a thermal conductivity of @xmath88 w / m k. the vertical diffusion time was @xmath89s .",
    "the convection rolls were imaged using the shadowgraph method @xcite . at large @xmath8 , strong spatial variation of the refractive index caused nonlinear optical effects in the images,@xcite but the general features of the pattern could still be discerned . this effect limited our ability to do wave - number measurements for @xmath90 .",
    "nonetheless , the location of the umbilicus could still be measured .    in order to obtain concentric rolls , @xmath4 was set to zero and the side - wall heater - power was set to 0.26 w. after waiting two hours , we increased the temperature difference to @xmath91c ( @xmath92 ) and allowed the system to equilibrate for one hour .",
    "after this the temperature difference was abruptly increased to @xmath93c ( @xmath94 ) and the system was allowed to equilibrate for two hours .",
    "the jump of @xmath4 was necessary because defects typically formed in the interior when the temperature difference was raised gradually .",

    "[ fig : transition_up ] and [ fig : transition_higher ] .",
    "all images were divided by a background image taken at @xmath104 .",
    "they were filtered by setting to black ( white ) all pixels that fell below ( above ) a certain threshold . a gaussian blur",
    "was then applied to the chopped image .",
    "we developed an algorithm to determine the local wave - director field @xmath105 .",
    "this method will be described in detail elsewhere .",
    "first the orientation field @xmath106 at each point of the image was calculated using a method similar to one introduced by cross et .",
    "al . , @xcite but higher angular resolution was employed .",
    "the wave - number field @xmath107 was then calculated at each point by moving orthogonal to the the roll orientation at that point and determining the number of pixels which falls within one wave length , assuming a locally periodic structure .",
    "determinations of the wave number @xmath108 from the images require a knowledge of @xmath3 and of the horizontal distance @xmath109 between adjacent pixels .",
    "the uncertainty of @xmath3 yielded an uncertainty of only a small fraction of a percent .",
    "we determined @xmath109 by counting the number of pixels which spanned the sample diameter .",
    "this yielded @xmath110 and led to a combined uncertainty of about 2 % for @xmath111 .",
    "an extrapolation of the measured @xmath111-values with decreasing @xmath8 to @xmath112 gave @xmath113 , which is within the experimental uncertainty of the value 3.117 for the infinitely extended set of straight rolls .",
    "we measured the location of the umbilicus by using a @xmath114 square section surrounding the center .",
    "the location of the umbilicus was estimated by computing the maximum of the cross - correlation of the measured orientation field @xmath115 and the orientation field for perfectly centered rolls @xmath116 .",
    "this estimate was used only to identify the rough location of the umbilicus .",

    "a roll was lost at the umbilicus . for all but the first transition",
    "the umbilicus first moved away from the center as @xmath8 grew .",
    "the angle of the umbilicus displacement did not have a preferred value , as can be seen from the examples in figs .",
    "[ fig : transition_up ] and [ fig : transition_higher ] .",
    "this indicates that the cell was sufficiently uniform . at the transition the umbilicus collapsed , reducing the number of rolls in the system by one .",
    "after a roll was lost , the new umbilicus immediately moved back toward the center of the sample but never quite reached it .",
    "this process was analogous to that observed in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "the umbilicus displacement before each transition produced a noticeable azimuthal variation of the wave number , with higher wave numbers in the direction of the displacement , and lower wave numbers opposite the displacement direction .",
    "close to but before the sixth transition , for @xmath122 , a patch of cross rolls @xcite formed along the outermost roll on the side opposite the direction of umbilicus displacement . at that point",
    "the local wave number @xmath111 of the concentric rolls was the smallest of the entire wave - number field , and was about 1.95 ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the corresponding point in the @xmath124 plane is shown as a solid circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : bussball ] . the wave number @xmath125 of the cross rolls that formed was about 4.3 .",

    "the travelling waves occurred first on the third or fourth roll from the wall , and with increasing @xmath8 spread throughout the cell .",
