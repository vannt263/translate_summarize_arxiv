    "experimental data on heavy ion collisions has traditionally been described by the thermal model [ 1 - 27 ] .",
    "the thermal model core assumption is that fireball produced in the relativistic nuclear collision reaches thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "such an assumption allows one to describe the multiplicities of particles registered in the experiment using two parameters , namely the temperature @xmath1 and baryo - chemical potential @xmath2 .",
    "the extracted values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 not only describe the experimental data , but they also give an essential information about the last stage of fireball evolution , when the inelastic collisions cease to exist , but the elastic collisions between hadron and the decay of resonances take place .",
    "this stage is usually called the chemical freeze - out .",
    "the thermal model was initially used for the ags and sps data @xcite and was subsequently employed to describe the data collected at sis @xcite , sps @xcite and rhic @xcite . using the thermal model it was possible to correctly predict the hadron ratios measured at lhc @xcite , while the only wrong prediction for lhc was made for @xmath3/@xmath4 ratio @xcite .",
    "an analysis of the energy dependence of thermal parameters extracted from fits of the experimental data established the line of chemical freeze - out @xcite .",
    "consequently , thermal model is an established tool for particle production analysis and chemical freeze - out investigation .",
    "however , the thermal model suffers from several weak points which should be accounted for in more careful studies .",
    "the present paper is just devoted to a critical analysis of the thermal model and contains several directions to develop and improve it .",
    "first of all we would like to notice that the term `` thermal model '' is a common name for a set of similar models , each having its specific features such as the strangeness suppression factor @xmath5 , the inhomogeneous freeze - out scenario @xcite etc .",
    "here we consider the minimal thermal model with two major parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 , following the approach of andronic et al .",
    ", @xcite , and below we briefly formulate the main problems of the model to be analyzed in the present work .    *",
    "* particle table .",
    "* in order to describe the experimental data using the thermal model one needs the masses , the widths and the decay branching ratios of all existing resonances . in principle , the mass spectrum of the hadronic resonances that are heavier than 2,3 gev is known poorly and , hence , they could create a problem .",
    "however , recently it was shown that the large width of heavy resonances leads to their strong suppression @xcite and , hence , their contribution into the thermodynamic functions of hadronic phase is negligible .",
    "note that not only the parameters of hadrons from the `` tail '' of mass spectrum are poorly known .",
    "for example , both the mass and the width of @xmath6 meson are not well established , but the thermal model predictions are strongly influenced by the values of the mass and width of this meson @xcite , while for many other baryons the width and branching ratios of decays are not well established at all .",
    "thus , the particle table is one source of uncertainty of the thermal model . *",
    "* hard - core spheres radii value . *",
    "the ideal gas description has proven to be unsatisfactory @xcite long ago .",
    "the simplest way to introduce an interaction between hadrons is to use the repulsive hard - core potential , since the attraction between them is usually accounted for via many sorts of hadrons @xcite . in the simplest case",
    "this potential depends only on a single parameter - the hard - core radius . in general case",
    ", each particle type may have its own hard - core radius .",
    "but for the sake of convenience and simplicity the hard - core radius is usually taken equal for all particles .",
    "the usual value for such a radius is @xmath7 fm .",
    "this value is motivated by the hard - core volume known from nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite .",
    "there are , however , two restrictions on the hard - core radii range : ( i ) they should be small enough to satisfy the condition @xmath8 , i.e. that the total eigen volume of all particles @xmath9 should be much smaller than total volume of the system @xmath10 ; ( ii ) on the other hand , these radii should nt be too small , because otherwise the model will lead to a contradiction with the lattice quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) thermodynamics data @xcite .",
    "thus , there is a certain freedom in defining the hard - core radii values which , so far , was not systematically exploit to describe the whole massive of existing experimental data . * * conservation laws . * also here we would like to discuss the baryon charge and isospin projection conservation laws .",
    "it was suggested to use them in the form @xcite @xmath11 the initial values are chosen @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite , neglecting the fact that only the part of initial particles belong to the midrapidity region .",
    "below we study the role of these conservation laws and show that such a treatment leads to physically unrealistic freeze - out volumes and to very bad description of hadron multiplicities , while the particle yield ratios ( we use such a term for the ratio of multiplicities in order avoid a confusion ) description can be extremely good . * * multiplicities fit . *",
    "the fit of hadron multiplicities is usually performed using three parameters : @xmath14 and @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "below we show that such a procedure combined with above mentioned conservation laws is mathematically ambiguous and it leads to the problems with the imposed baryonic charge conservation law .",
    "in addition to these usual features of the thermal model we would like to thoroughly investigate the role of the lorentz contraction of eigen volumes of hadrons to essentially improve the previous analysis @xcite and to study the influence of the hadronic surface tension on the fit of the freeze - out parameters . as we argue the latter may provide us with new information about the critical temperature value of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "such a comprehensive analysis of the different features of the thermal model and the experimental data will also allow us to elucidate the correct criterion of the chemical freeze - out which is a very hot topic nowadays .",
    "furthermore , we perform the simultaneous fit of hadron multiplicities and the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio for all available energies of collisions and , hence , for the first time obtain the high quality fit of the strangeness horn , i.e. the peak in the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio .",
    "the work is organized as follows .",
    "the basic features of the thermal model are outlined in the next section . in section 3",
    "we discuss the important problems related to the conservation laws and propose their solutions .",
    "the discussion of the existing chemical freeze - out criteria and formulation of a new criterion along with a novel effect of the adiabatic chemical hadron production is given in section 4 , while section 5 is devoted to the model reformulation for the multi - component hadron gas mixture . in section 6",
    "we investigate the values of the hard - core radii and study the effect of the lorentz contraction of hard - core spheres .",
    "section 7 is devoted to the analysis of the hadronic surface tension , while in section 8 we describe the strangeness horn .",
    "section 9 contains our conclusions .",
    "in order to study the role of conservation laws in a form suggested in @xcite and employed in their subsequent publications it is , first of all , necessary to reproduce the results obtained in that work . for this purpose",
    "let us consider the boltzmann gas consisting of @xmath17 sorts of hadrons having the temperature @xmath1 and the volume @xmath10 .",
    "each @xmath18-th sort is characterized by its own mass @xmath19 and chemical potential @xmath20 .",

    "the interaction of hadrons and resonances is usually accounted for by the hard - core repulsion of the van der waals type @xcite as @xmath38 where the pressure @xmath39 and the @xmath18-th charge density @xmath40 of an ideal gas is modified due to hard - core repulsion . here @xmath41 is the excluded volume for the hard - core radius @xmath42 , which in actual calculations was taken to be @xmath43 fm for all hadrons .",
    "the usual van der waals correction affects the particle densities , but has no effect on particle ratios @xcite .",
    "while its effect on the charge and particle densities may be strong , for the freeze - out densities obtained at and above the highest sps energy @xmath44 gev the excluded volume correction leads to a reduction of the densities by about of 50 percent .",
    "the resonance decays are usually accounted for in the following way : the final multiplicity of hadron @xmath45 consists of the thermal contribution @xmath46 and the decay ones : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the decay branching of the y - th hadron into the hadron x. the masses , the widths and the decay branchings were taken from the particle tables used by the thermodynamic code thermus @xcite .",
    "the width @xmath49 of the resonance of mean mass @xmath50 is accounted for by replacing the boltzmann distribution function in the particle pressure by its average over the breit - wigner mass distribution as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the dominant decay channel mass .",
    "using the thermal model formulated in previous section we fitted the hadron yield ratios in the energy range from ags to rhic , i.e. for @xmath53 = 2.7 @xmath54 200 gev .",
    "we used the @xmath55 minimization for all the ratios available for this energy range as the fit criterion .",
    "the present consideration is very similar to that one used in @xcite .",
    "the main sources of difference are listed below .    * * the boltzmann statistics * is used here instead of the quantum statistics employed in @xcite .",
    "this allows us to essentially fasten the simulations since the momentum integration can be done only once for each hadron species .",
    "we checked that for the freeze - out temperatures @xmath56 mev obtained here the difference of the results due to the boltzmann statistics is almost negligible . *",

    "this our effort to study the role of the lorentz contraction is inspired by the fact that the conventional thermal model has problems with the light mesons description .",
    "thus , to describe the pion multiplicity and the ratios containing the pions it was proposed to introduce @xmath120 which is smaller than all the other hadron radii @xcite .",
    "another example of difficulties with the light mesons is a `` strangeness horn '' , i.e. the peak in the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio .",
    "its description was finally improved by fitting the @xmath6 meson mass and width @xcite , but the obtained description is far from being very good .",
    "let us see whether the lorentz contraction might resolve these problems . at a given temperature",

    "consequently , the excluded volume of lighter particles gets smaller compared to the excluded volume of heavier ones @xcite .",

    "it was also shown @xcite that the lorentz contraction removes the causality paradox from the thermal model , i.e. at high densities the speed of sound does not exceed the speed of light .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to incorporate the lorentz contraction into conventional thermal model and study its effect on the hadron multiplicity description . in order to make the numerical evaluation of the relativistic excluded volumes faster we heuristically derived an approximative formula for such volumes which allows one to reduce the six dimensional integration over the pair of three - vectors of particle momenta to the three dimensional integral .",

    "inclusion of the surface free energy into the thermal model is equivalent to adding the term @xmath130 to the total chemical potential .",
    "if @xmath28 is the same for all hadrons , such a surface tension correction does not affect the hadron yield ratios .",

    "note that for @xmath135 such a temperature dependence coincides with the famous fisher droplet model parameterization @xcite , whereas for @xmath136 it is in line with the recent findings @xcite .",
    "we have performed several global fits with the parameterization ( [ eqxxi ] ) , using different data sets .",
    "the results are listed in the table  [ tab : surf_ten ] .    from this table",
    "one can conclude that the inclusion of the surface tension in the form ( [ eqxxi ] ) does not improve the fit quality , however , since in all cases the value of @xmath122 is almost the same as without accounting for the surface tension , it also does not spoil the fit quality .",
    "this fact allows us to take the obtained values of parameters @xmath133 and @xmath137 rather seriously .",
    "it is not surprising , that the value of @xmath133 is close to zero , otherwise the sizable surface tension of hadrons could be already found .",
    "the really surprising fact is that for the center of mass energies @xmath138 gev the parameter @xmath0 mev is extremely close to the critical temperature value @xmath126 mev found in @xcite more than a year ago using entirely different approach .",
    "of course , the reason of why the global fit that includes the low energy data gives essentially lower value of the parameter @xmath137 should be understood , and , hence , the investigation of the hadronic surface tension should be continued using both the experimental data on hadron production and the lattice qcd data .",
    "the thorough analysis performed above led us to a conclusion that besides the hadron surface tension inclusion the further improvement of the thermal model can be achieved , if we consider the pion and kaon hard - core radii , as an independent fitting parameters . on the one hand this would allow us to have two additional fitting parameters , and on the other hand one could include the strangeness horn data into the fitting procedure .",
    "note that up to now the quality of the strangeness horn description is far from being satisfactory , although very different formulations of the thermal model are used for this purpose @xcite .",
    "thus , the most recent compilation of the strangeness horn description by the different thermal models can be found in @xcite .    to improve the strangeness horn description",
    "can be easily understood from the fact that just the non - monotonic behavior of the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio as the function of the center of mass energy of collision is often claimed to be one of a few existing signals of the onset on deconfinement @xcite .",
    "the multi - component hadron gas model developed in @xcite is perfectly suited to treat the pion and kaon hard - core radii as independent fitting parameters .",
    "the physical idea behind such an approach is that the hadronic hard - core radii are the effective parameters which include the contributions of the repulsion and attraction .",
    "since the parameters of hadron - hadron interaction are , generally speaking , individual for each kind of hadrons , then each kind of hadrons can have its own hard - core radius .",
    "based on this idea we performed a global fit of all hadron multiplicities as described above together with the strangeness horn data considering the pion hard - core radius @xmath139 and the kaon hard - core radius @xmath140 as independent variables together with the chemical freeze - out temperature and baryonic chemical potential , whereas the hard - core radius of all other mesons and the hard - core radius of baryons were fixed , respectively , as @xmath141 fm and @xmath142 fm according to the findings of section 6 .",

    "[ horn_new ] . comparing figs .",
    "[ str_horn ] and [ horn_new ] one can see the dramatic improvement of the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio for the collision energies @xmath53 above 8 gev .",
    "in fact , the @xmath15/@xmath16 ratio shown in fig . [ horn_new ]",
    "deviates from the experimental error bars on for the energy @xmath143 gev , while for all other collision energies it does not essentially deviate from the experimental error bars .",
    "thus , the variations of pion and kaon hard - core radii essentially improve the description of this ratio for all collision energies , but at the same time the quality of the fit of all other hadronic multiplicities does not worsen as it is seen from the resulting value of @xmath144 for the global fit , which , so far , is the best result obtained in the literature .",
    "in this work we performed a comprehensive analysis of the experimental hadron multiplicities within the thermal model .",
    "as in previous studies the considered thermal model has two hard - core radii ( @xmath92 for baryons and @xmath91 for mesons ) and two new elements : an inclusion of the lorentz contraction of eigen volumes of hadrons and a treatment of hadronic surface tension . using this model we studied the role of the imposed conservation laws ( [ eqv ] ) and ( [ eqvi ] ) , and showed that for the adequate description of hadron multiplicities the conservation laws should be modified , whereas for the description of hadron yield ratios the conservation laws are not necessary at all .",
    "in addition , we suggested and analyzed the thermal model in which the pion and kaon hard - core radii are independent fitting parameters compared to all other mesons .",
    "here we also analyzed the usual criteria for the chemical freeze - out and found that none of them is robust .",
    "therefore we suggested a novel criterion of chemical freeze - out , a constant value of entropy per hadron number equals to 7.18 . such a criterion",
    "is also supported by the different formulation of thermal model @xcite and it evidences for the new physical effect which we called the * adiabatic chemical hadron production*.    the performed analysis allowed us to find the restrictions on the hard - core radii that are imposed by the experimental data .",
    "also we showed that although an inclusion of the lorentz contraction improves the fit quality for any pair of baryon and meson hard - core radii , but at the same time it has a small effect on the chemical freeze - out parameters and on @xmath145 ratio .",
    "in addition we phenomenologically introduced the surface tension in thermal model and made several global fits to find its parameters .",
    "although , the surface tension inclusion does not improve the fit quality , for the first time it is found that the temperature of the nil surface tension value depends on the considered interval of the collision energy .",
    "thus , if the low energy data are included into the fit , then the nil surface tension temperature is about @xmath146 mev , while the data for the center of mass energies above 10 gev lead to an essentially larger value of this temperature value @xmath0 mev .",
    "the latter is a very intriguing result since a very close estimate for the nil surface tension temperature was obtained recently within entirely different analysis of the quark gluon bag surface tension @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is possible that these two independently obtained results , indeed , evidence that the ( tri)critical temperature of the qcd phase diagram is between 140 and 154 mev .    the most dramatic numerical effect , however , is obtained for the truly multi - component hadron gas model worked out in @xcite and employed here for the first time . in this model the hard - core radii of pions and kaons differ from the hard - core radius of all other mesons and they are treated as independent fitting parameters .",
    "such an approach allowed us for the first time to simultaneously fit the hadron multiplicities together with the strangeness horn and to get the chemical freeze - out data description of very high quality .",
    "in order to fasten the numerical evaluation of the relativistic excluded volumes we would like to obtain an approximate expression which would reduce the dimension of momentum integrations of two particles from six to three . basically here we employ the heuristic method suggested in @xcite .",
    "the main difference , however , is that in @xcite the ultra - relativistic expression for the excluded volume was derived , while here we would like to get an expression which would be accurate both in the non - relativistic and ultra - relativistic limits .    for this purpose let us consider two relativistic spheres @xmath147 and @xmath148 , there @xmath149-factors being @xmath150 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "the hard - core radii in their rest frames are @xmath152 and @xmath153 , respectively .",
    "let us fix an angle @xmath154 between the momenta of two particles which is the standard spherical angle .",
    "it is chosen in such a way that the three momentum of @xmath147 coincides with @xmath155-axis ( see figs .",
    "[ y_ellipsoids ] and [ x_ellipsoids ] for details ) .",
    "then the angle @xmath154 is the azimuthal spherical angle of the momentum of second particle . due to the lorentz contraction",
    "the both spheres shrink in the direction of their momenta and one obtains two ellipsoids of revolution . here we show how to get an approximate formula for the excluded volume for such ellipsoids .    the basic idea is to neglect the complexity of the problem and treat the excluded volume as an ellipsoid , afterwards to symmetrize the obtained expression with respect to interchange @xmath156 and take the half of the sum of two expressions .",
    "then , the unsymmetrized excluded volume reads : @xmath157 where the ellipsoid s radii @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 are found from geometrical consideration given below .      from fig .",
