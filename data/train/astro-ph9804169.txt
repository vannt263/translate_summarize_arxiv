    "because the light from a distant galaxy comes from discrete but unresolved stars , poisson statistics lead to mottling of the galaxy s otherwise smooth surface brightness profile .",
    "surface brightness is independent of distance , but the amplitude of the surface brightness fluctuations ( sbfs ) is not . as the distance ( @xmath4 ) to a galaxy increases , the number of stars ( @xmath5 ) in a given resolution element increases as @xmath6 , but the observed flux ( @xmath7 ) from each star is reduced by @xmath8 , making surface brightness ( @xmath9 ) independent of distance . on the other hand ,",
    "the rms variation in observed flux from region to region is @xmath10 , which scales as @xmath11 .",
    "the variance in surface brightness @xmath12 normalized by the mean galaxy brightness @xmath9 decreases with distance ; distant galaxies appear smoother than nearby galaxies . because the variance in surface brightness is proportional to the second moment of the stellar luminosity function , it is dominated by luminous red giant stars .    although individual stars are not resolved , measuring sbfs probes the stellar population of the galaxy directly . with good theoretical models for stellar populations , the absolute magnitude of sbfs can be calculated , allowing a direct determination of the distance that is independent of the global dynamics or the environment of the galaxy ( to the extent that the stellar populations in old stellar systems are independent of these variables ) .",
    "alternatively , measuring sbfs in galaxies with known distances provides insight into stellar populations , allowing comparison with stellar evolution models and providing an empirical calibration of the sbf distance scale .",
    "good descriptions of the theory and practice of using sbfs as a distance measurement tool and stellar population probe can be found in several papers by tonry and collaborators ( tonry et al .",
    "1997 ; jensen , luppino , & tonry 1996 , hereafter jlt ; tonry 1991 ; tonry , ajhar , & luppino 1990 ; tonry & schneider 1988 ) , in papers by sodemann & thomsen ( 1995 , 1996 ) , and in the review by jacoby et al .",
    "the first @xmath13-band sbf studies are described by jlt , luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) , and pahre & mould ( 1994 ) .",
    "j. tonry and coworkers have completed an extensive survey of @xmath14-band sbf distances in a sample of several hundred early - type ( dynamically hot elliptical and s0 ) galaxies which is more than 50% complete out to @xmath152800  ( tonry et al .",
    "they find that the @xmath14-band absolute fluctuation magnitude  is a linear function of v - i  and has a universal zero point .",
    "their @xmath14-band calibration , which is based empirically on cepheid distances , is in good agreement with worthey s ( 1993a , b ; 1994 ) simple stellar populations models .",
    "worthey s models predict that the effects of age and metallicity in the @xmath14 band are largely degenerate , so that  may be calibrated using a single parameter such as the v - i  color .",
    "the resulting intrinsic scatter of the @xmath14-band sbf distance scale is of order 0.07 mag .",
    "the purpose of the current study is to examine the behavior of the sbf calibration in the near - ir  band , where worthey s models predict a much weaker dependence on v - i , but potentially larger scatter as the effects of age and metallicity are no longer degenerate .",
    "stellar surface brightness fluctuations are very red , since they are dominated by luminous red giant stars .",
    "the advantages of observing ir sbfs are clear : fluctuations are @xmath16 times brighter at @xmath13 than at @xmath14 , making them observable to greater distances .",
    "the sbf amplitude is inversely proportional to the seeing fwhm , and the seeing is typically much better in the ir than at optical wavelengths .",
    "fluctuations are also red compared to the globular cluster ( gc ) population , so the contrast between stellar sbfs and gcs is higher at @xmath13 . finally , stellar population models predict that @xmath13-band sbf magnitudes have a much weaker dependence on v - i  than at @xmath14 , reducing or eliminating the need to accurately measure the color of the galaxy ( worthey 1993a ) .",
    "several studies have demonstrated the feasibility of measuring ir sbfs , including luppino & tonry ( 1993 ) , pahre & mould ( 1994 ) , and jlt .",
    "these papers report results for a rather limited set of galaxies in the local group ( lg ) and the virgo cluster , but the consistency in the measured calibration of is encouraging ( @xmath17 luppino & tonry , @xmath18 pahre & mould , @xmath19 jlt ) .",
    "all three of these papers report absolute fluctuation magnitudes that are consistent with worthey s ( 1994 ) predictions based on simple stellar population models . while the mean  of jlt and pahre & mould ( 1994 ) are quite consistent , differences in apparent fluctuation magnitudes for individual galaxies are larger than the stated uncertainties allow .",
    "jlt discuss several possible reasons for the disagreement in fluctuation magnitudes and showed that residual variance resulting from spatial variations in the detector sensitivity and dark current can contribute significantly to the power spectrum in low signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath20 ) observations .",
    "a residual pattern of only 0.1% of the sky level can significantly change the fluctuation magnitude measured . to use ir sbfs as a reliable distance indicator ,",
    "it is critical that the observations be of sufficiently high @xmath20 ratio to avoid biases from residual variances .",
    "jlt also demonstrated that properly subtracting the sky and carefully sampling the point spread function ( psf ) are crucial to accurately measuring the fluctuation amplitude .",
    "an uncertainty in the background subtraction of 2% of the sky level can dominate the uncertainty in the fluctuation magnitude .",
    "our virgo sample showed a large dispersion ( 0.29 mag ) due to the depth of the cluster and observational errors .",
    "pahre & mould ( 1994 ) also addressed the dispersion in fluctuation magnitude in a similarly - sized sample of virgo ellipticals .",
    "clearly a larger sample of galaxies is needed to calibrate the ir sbf distance scale .",
    "to better understand the effects stellar populations have on the fluctuation amplitude , we observed five galaxies in the fornax cluster .",
    "fornax is ideal for several reasons : first , it is much more centrally concentrated than the virgo cluster .",
    "the reduced dispersion in distances allows us to better quantify and understand the uncertainty in our sbf measurements .",
    "second , fornax contains a large number of giant elliptical galaxies with a wide range of v - i  colors , metallicities , and globular cluster populations .",
    "the virgo galaxies observed by jlt and pahre & mould ( 1994 ) spanned a very limited range in 2  index to avoid stellar population variations which may affect the calibration of .",
    "we now extend the sample to calibrate  fluctuation magnitudes across a wider range of metallicities and v - i  colors to compare with theoretical stellar population models .",
    "finally , cepheid distances to several virgo cluster galaxies and to the fornax spiral ngc  1365 have been measured using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) .",
    "we can empirically anchor our -band sbf calibration both to the cepheid and the @xmath14-band sbf distance scales",
    ".    this paper reports results from our observations of four eridanus cluster elliptical galaxies in addition to the fornax galaxies .",
    "eridanus is not as compact a cluster as fornax , but we can still compare our ir sbf results with the @xmath14-band results from tonry ( 1997 ) . finally , we return to our sbf measurements for the seven virgo ellipticals discussed by jlt and apply the improved techniques we describe in this paper .",
    "we present the updated results for these galaxies in section  [ virgorevisited ] , along with new observations of ngc  4365 .",
    "this paper presents results derived from data obtained during several observing runs using the quirc camera mounted at the f/10 focus of the university of hawaii 2.24  m telescope .",
    "quirc is a near - ir camera employing the first-  and second - generation @xmath21-pixel hgcdte `` hawaii '' detectors ( hodapp et al .",
    "these observations are compared to previous work which used the 256@xmath0-pixel nicmos detector ( jlt , luppino & tonry 1993 ) .",
    "the second - generation science - grade hawaii array has far fewer bad pixels , higher quantum efficiency , and a much more spatially uniform response than the earlier hgcdte devices .",
    "the dark current for these detectors is less than 1  e@xmath22s@xmath23 and the readnoise is @xmath1515  e@xmath22 .",
    "the quirc camera has a plate scale of 01886  pixel@xmath23 , providing a field of view 32 on a side .",
    "the university of hawaii  filter used for these observations is centered at a slightly shorter wavelength ( 2.11 ) than the standard @xmath13 filter to reduce the thermal background ( wainscoat & cowie 1992 ) .",

    "sub - pixel registration was not used because such procedures produce noise that is correlated from pixel to pixel and is therefore not constant with wavenumber in the power spectrum .    to calibrate the photometry",
    ", we frequently observed the faint ukirt standards ( casali & hawarden 1992 ) .",
    "the majority of our 1995 october observations were made when conditions were not photometric .",
    "the photometric zero point fluctuated by as much as 0.25 mag during periods of all but one of the nights . to better calibrate our photometry",
    ", we compared our results to photoelectric aperture photometry ( persson , frogel , & aaronson 1979 , frogel et al .",
    "1978 , persson et al .",
    "we measured the difference between our magnitudes and the photoelectric magnitudes for all galaxies in common ( 7 of 9 ) and used the mean difference and standard deviation to adjust our photometric zero - point and uncertainty for each night .",

    "worthey s models predict corrections no larger than @xmath49 mag between ages of 5 and 17 gyr .",
    "the fact that @xmath13 sbfs change so little as a function of redshift is very encouraging .",
    "the purpose of calibrating  sbfs is to allow sbf measurements to be made to much larger distances than possible at @xmath14 band , and the absence of significant k corrections reduces the uncertainty in doing so .",
    "we followed the same procedures described by jlt to measure sbf amplitudes in this data , with important modifications to account for the contributions from undetected globular clusters and background galaxies .",
    "we used the vista image analysis software ( written by t. lauer and r. stover ) and additional programs written by j. tonry to perform the sbf analysis . the first step in",
    "the process was to determine the residual sky background remaining after stacking individual images .",
    "we assumed that this small adjustment ( typically @xmath50 of the sky level ) was constant over the entire frame and could be applied as an offset to the final flattened and registered image .",
    "as jlt found , however , the fluctuation power is quite sensitive to residual patterns in sky subtraction , flat fielding , and non - zero background offsets , even at the level of @xmath51 of the sky level .",
    "we estimated the residual sky background levels in the final images by fitting a devaucouleurs @xmath52 profile to each galaxy using elliptical apertures .",
    "the larger quirc field of view made it possible to determine the residual sky level much more accurately than using nicmos .",
    "the sky levels in the jlt data were also remeasured for consistency .",
    "the next step in measuring the sbf magnitude was to fit and subtract the galaxy profile .",
    "we used a routine which allows the center , ellipticity , and position angle to vary as we fit annuli of increasing radius , and we iterated the procedure to ensure that the fit was well - behaved .",
    "point sources were masked before fitting the galaxy profile .",
    "the resulting model of the galaxy was subtracted from the data .",
    "large - scale residual background variations were also fitted and subtracted , leaving a smooth , flat background with stellar sbfs , globular clusters , background galaxies , foreground stars , and noise superimposed .",
    "the noise varies with position in the image because of the subtraction of the galaxy , although in our ir images sky - subtraction noise dominates everywhere in the image except very near the center of the galaxy .",
    "globular clusters and background galaxies were masked as described in the following section .",
    "the residual image was then masked with a window function which selected the region of the galaxy to be analyzed .",
    "the fourier transform and power spectrum were then computed for the data .",
    "the variance arising from stellar sbfs and unresolved point sources was determined from the best fit of the data power spectrum with the function @xmath53 a linear combination of the fluctuation power @xmath54 in times the expectation power spectrum @xmath55 and a white noise component @xmath56 arising from photon shot noise .",
    "the white noise component depends on the background sky level and the mean galaxy brightness : @xmath57 in the absence of sky background and blurring by the atmosphere , @xmath58 and @xmath54 is simply the power at @xmath59 . in real observations ,",
    "the fluctuations are convolved with the psf .",
    "we must also account for the contribution to the power spectrum caused by the sharp edges of our window function and point source mask .",
    "the expectation power spectrum @xmath55 is the power spectrum of the psf modified slightly to include the power spectrum of the window function , scaled by the square root of the mean galaxy brightness within the window . to compute",
    ", we started by extracting a bright psf star from the galaxy - subtracted image .",
    "the region around the star was cleaned of other stars , if necessary , and we confirmed that the background was zero .",
    "we used as large an aperture around the star as possible without allowing sky subtraction noise or uncertainties in the residual background level to corrupt the power spectrum of the psf at low wavenumbers .",
    "this usually required masking the psf for radii greater than @xmath60 .",
    "we checked the aperture photometry to confirm that the total flux of the psf star was consistent with the power measured within the aperture .",
    "the fourier transform and power spectrum of the psf were computed and fitted with a third - order polynomial .",
    "for small wavenumbers ( @xmath61 ) , the fit to the power spectrum was used to create a composite psf spectrum , and the flux at @xmath59 is normalized to unity .",
    "next , we multiplied the window function mask by the point source mask which removed the detected globular clusters and galaxies brighter than the limiting magnitude .",
    "the window mask was then multiplied by the square root of the galaxy profile model .",
    "the scaling of the variance by the mean galaxy brightness was thereby included in the expectation power spectrum .",
    "the fourier transform and power spectrum for the resulting image were computed .",
    "the expectation power spectrum  is the convolution of the normalized power spectrum of the psf and the power spectrum of the modified window function : @xmath62 in computing  in this way , we are effectively multiplying the data by the mask prior to convolution with the psf .",
    "the effect of this approximation on the expectation power spectrum is minimal , and  is very nearly the power spectrum of the psf alone .",
    "the fluctuation magnitude is computed from the fit to the data in the radial region of the galaxy where @xmath54 is mostly constant with wavenumber @xmath63 . near the center of the galaxy ,",
    "the sampled area is small and the power spectrum varies due to the small number of fluctuations being measured . in the largest apertures , noise from sky subtraction dominates and the @xmath20 ratio is significantly reduced . to get the best fit for @xmath54 , we examine the power spectra in apertures centered on the galaxy , and include the largest area possible in the final fit that does not compromise the quality of the power spectrum . for the data described in this paper , we measured @xmath54 in apertures with inner and outer radii of 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 48 and 80 .",
    "the fits to the power spectra were performed in radial regions where @xmath54 was nearly constant and for wavenumbers in the range @xmath64 .",
    "once @xmath54 is known from the fit to the data ( equation  [ sbffit ] above ) , the fluctuation magnitude is defined as @xmath65 where @xmath54 is a flux in and @xmath66 is the magnitude of a source yielding one  at the top of the atmosphere .",
    "pixel to pixel variance can arise from a number of sources other than the surface brightness fluctuations resulting from the poisson statistics of the stellar population .",
    "foreground stars , globular clusters , other galaxies ( usually in the background ) and clumpy dust can all contribute to the fluctuation power we measure . by working in the near - infrared",
    ", we minimize the effects of dust absorption .",
    "faint galactic foreground stars beyond limiting magnitude of our observations are not numerous enough to add significantly to the sbf power measured ( wainscoat et al . 1992 ) . to remove the contribution from gcs , we first identify as many as possible .",
    "gcs brighter than the completeness limit are masked .",
    "assuming we know the form of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) , we can extrapolate beyond the completeness limit to determine the residual variance due to undetected clusters .",
    "this technique has been shown to work successfully by decreasing the cutoff magnitude and confirming that the fluctuation magnitude does not change significantly ( tonry 1991 ) .",
    "blakeslee & tonry ( 1995 ) used sbfs to measure the gclf of coma cluster elliptical galaxies without detecting the majority of the gcs individually .",
    "the procedure for removing background galaxies is similar .",
    "we determine the magnitudes of the galaxies brighter than the completeness limit and assume a power - law distribution of galaxies to estimate the contribution from undetected galaxies .",
    "since stellar sbfs are much redder than gcs , we expect the relative contribution to the fluctuations from gcs to be smaller",
    ". however , we do not sample the gclf as deeply at  because the background is brighter and our sensitivity to faint point sources is reduced . to estimate the relative contributions to the fluctuation power from gcs , background galaxies , and stellar sbfs as a function of limiting magnitude and distance , we adapted blakeslee & tonry s ( 1995 ) models to the @xmath13 band . to calculate the models plotted in figure  [ models ] , we derived the following expressions for the variances arising from stellar sbfs , gcs , and background galaxies . in general , the variance arising from a population with @xmath67 sources per unit flux per pixel is @xmath68 ( tonry & schneider 1988 , eq .  4 ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that there is a maximum gc contribution to the fluctuation power measured which is approximately equal to the stellar sbf variance . in the @xmath14 band ,",
    "the gc contribution is a factor of 10 greater compared to the stellar fluctuations .",

    "2 ) was developed which carefully accounts for the galaxy subtraction and sbf contributions to the noise ( tonry et al .",
    "1990 ) . in the results presented here , we used the standard `` off - the - shelf '' dophot version 3 which does not correct for galaxy subtraction in modeling the noise . at , sky subtraction noise dominates at all radii except very near the center of the galaxy .",
    "dophot performs well except within a few arcseconds of the center , and we examined the objects found near the center and edited them manually as appropriate .    with the output list of objects and magnitudes from dophot , we constructed luminosity functions in radial bins and determined the completeness limit .",
    "a mask was made to remove all objects brighter than the completeness limit , and we estimated the residual variance for the population fainter than the cutoff magnitude . to do this , we fitted the observed luminosity function with a sum of a gaussian gclf and a power - law function for the background galaxies .",
    "objects brighter than @xmath101 were not included in the fits , nor were objects with @xmath102 .",
    "the gclf width was assumed to be 1.4 mag ( blakeslee & tonry 1995 , 1996 ) , and the distance was varied to determine the best fit .",
    "when the gclf was not well - sampled , the distance was fixed and the fits performed without distance as a free parameter .",
    "the galaxies were assumed to have a power - law distribution with an exponential coefficient of 0.30 ( cowie et al .",
    "1994 , djorgovski et al .",
    "the normalization was left as a free parameter , and we confirmed that the fit predicted reasonable number counts at faint magnitudes . because we tried to constrain both the gc and galaxy populations with relatively few points at the bright end of the distributions , the covariance between the components was often significant .",
    "for these observations , the completeness limit was 2 to 3.5 mag brighter than the peak of the gclf .",
    "our ability to sample the luminosity function was not only limited by the bright sky background , but also by the small field of view .",
    "we found that the fits were best constrained by fixing the distance to the galaxy and hence the gclf peak @xmath103 , either using cepheid or @xmath14-band sbf distances .",
    "the fits using these assumed distances were good , but our measurements of the gclf do not constitute an independent measurement of the distance given our sampling of only the brightest few clusters . once the luminosity functions had been fitted , we extrapolated and integrated the contributions to the variance coming from sources fainter than the cutoff magnitude .",
    "we then computed the residual power @xmath104 for the region of the galaxy being examined , and we subtracted @xmath104 from @xmath54 prior to computing the fluctuation magnitude .",
    "ir sbf measurements are limited by the bright sky background rather than photon shot noise in the fluctuations themselves . because the background is so bright , integration times would have to be much longer at  than at @xmath14 to reach comparable limiting magnitudes .",
    "however , at  fluctuations are much brighter than at @xmath14 , so it is not necessary to reach as faint a limiting magnitude to measure the fluctuations .",
    "the result is that at  we identify many fewer globular clusters than in comparable observations at @xmath14 .",
    "furthermore , modern ccds typically cover a larger field of view than ir detectors , making it possible to sample more of the gclf than we can at .",
    "a comparison of the luminosity functions from @xmath14 and -band sbf observations of ngc  1399 is shown in figure  [ likefig2 ] .",
    "the @xmath14 band data are taken from tonry ( 1997 ) . even though the peak of the gclf is brighter at  than it is at @xmath14 , the deeper @xmath14-band images sample a much greater fraction of the gclf .",
    "we can take advantage of the deeper @xmath14-band images by using them to identify gc and galaxy positions , and we use this information to mask sources in the  image .",
    "this allows us to remove objects that are not detectable in the  image before performing the sbf analysis . in the case of ngc  1399 ( fig .",
    "[ likefig2 ] ) , the @xmath14-band completeness limit is approximately 22.75 mag . given that the mean color of gcs is @xmath81 ( frogel et al .",
    "1978 ) and @xmath105 ( ajhar & tonry 1994 ) , we adopt a mean @xmath106 .",
    "the equivalent cutoff magnitude of the @xmath14-band observation shifted to   is 21.5 , 2.5 mag fainter than the completeness limit of the  observation alone .",
    "examination of figure  [ models ] and assuming a distance modulus of 31.22 to fornax ( tonry 1997 ) shows that this corresponds to a ratio of @xmath107 . on the other hand , had we relied upon the  observations alone , the cutoff magnitude would be @xmath108 mag , and the corresponding ratio @xmath109 .",
    "when gcs and galaxies make up such a large fraction of the sbf magnitude , the uncertainty in the @xmath104 correction is large . by combining @xmath14 and  data we gain the important advantage of reducing the @xmath104 correction to a negligible level",
    ".    this paper reports sbf results from our  data alone , applying the corrections determined by fitting the gc and galaxy luminosity functions as described above .",
    "we also present  sbf magnitudes determined using the @xmath14-band masks . in practice ,",
    "we collected @xmath14-band images and object masks from the optical sbf survey ( tonry 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath14-band images and masks were scaled , rotated , and cropped appropriately to bring them into registration with the  image . in the subsequent sbf analysis , we replaced the -band mask with the @xmath14-band mask , removing clusters and galaxies from the  image which were not detected because of the sky background noise .",
    "the residual variance @xmath104 was taken to be zero and the fluctuation magnitude computed .",
    "the nicmos3 and first - generation hawaii 1024@xmath0-pixel hgcdte detectors used for these observations have banded sensitivity and dark - current patterns that are easily seen in the raw images ( hodapp et al .",
    "1996 , fig .  4 ) .",
    "jlt found that imperfect sky and galaxy subtraction can leave a residual variance which contributes to the spatial power spectrum .",
    "in low-@xmath20 ratio measurements , the residual background variance can be a significant fraction of the fluctuation power measured . imperfectly fitting the galaxy profile and background leave patterns that add power to the spectrum .",
    "the  sky background is @xmath110 times brighter than the galaxy , even near the center , and imperfect sky subtraction affects the fit to the galaxy profile .",
    "also , if an object is not masked prior to fitting the galaxy profile , the iterative elliptical profile fitting routine will find too much flux and overestimate the galaxy brightness at that radius , resulting in an elliptical ring in the galaxy profile .",
    "unmasked objects brighter than the completeness limit that escaped detection by dophot are not accounted for in the fit to the luminosity function and also contribute to the residual power spectrum . in fitting the sbf power spectrum to determine @xmath54",
    ", we avoid low wavenumbers @xmath111 which are contaminated by large - scale features in the image .",
    "however , residual patterns are not smoothly varying , and are observed to contribute power on scales of @xmath112 , where the fit to @xmath54 is commonly performed .",
    "we attempted to measure the contribution from residual patterns in several different ways .",
    "first , we examined the radial behavior of @xmath54 .",
    "we frequently found that @xmath54 increased with radius by as much as a factor of two within 1  of the center .",
    "stellar population models would require a decrease in age of @xmath113 gyr or a increase in [ fe / h ] of at least 1 dex to account for a gradient this large ( worthey 1994 , 1997 ) .",
    "galaxies that do show radial sbf gradients such as ngc  3379 ( sodemann & thomsen 1995 ) or maffei 1 ( luppino & tonry 1993 ) only show a change of @xmath114 mag within an arcminute of the galaxy center . furthermore , from dynamical arguments , we expect the outer envelopes of elliptical galaxies to be older and more metal - poor than the centers ( faber et al .",
    "stellar population models predict that ir sbfs should be fainter in the outer regions , not brighter , if the outer regions of the galaxy are older and metal deficient .",
    "we regard the increasing sbf amplitude with radius as evidence for residual variance , especially in relatively low-@xmath20 ratio observations .",
    "variance remaining due to improper galaxy subtraction , incomplete point - source masking , and residual dark current patterns will affect the larger outer annuli more strongly , leading to an increasing fluctuation power with radius . assuming a modest residual power of 0.1% of the sky value usually brings all apertures to the same fluctuation power .",
    "we conducted several experiments to see if a level of residual variance of 0.1% of the sky level was reasonable . in one trial , we took two averaged sky images observed on one night , separated in time by about half an hour .",
    "the resulting difference image contains residual patterns at the level we might expect to accumulate during typical observing , since in our normal image reduction strategy we averaged individual sky frames taken during approximately half an hour .",
    "the power spectrum of the difference image was measured using the same sbf procedures used to analyze the data images .",
    "the spectrum rose steeply for @xmath115 , and gradually decreased with increasing @xmath63 . the residual variance measured in this way",
    "should be considered an upper limit , since the patterns were added coherently ( sky frames are combined without registration ) . in the final registered galaxy images ,",
    "residual patterns were partially cancelled because individual galaxy images had been dithered . in another experiment , we combined individual sky images with their relative offsets , so that residual patterns were not added coherently as in the previous example .",
    "we then computed the power spectrum and measured the deviation from a flat spectrum .",
    "the power spectra show the same behavior observed in the previous experiment but with a lower amplitude . since this measurement of the residual variance is for the sky subtraction only , and",
    "does not account for any residual pattern from the galaxy subtraction or point source removal , it is a lower limit of the residual variance we expect in a galaxy power spectrum .",
    "the variances measured in these two experiments fall between 0.02% and 0.2% of the sky value , confirming that 0.1% is a reasonable estimate of the residual spatial variance .",
    "occasionally faint objects were not identified by dophot ; we measured the flux in these objects and found that they can contribute up to 0.1% of the sky level in variance .",
    "we removed such objects and repeated the sbf analysis to confirm the reliability of our procedure for removing residual variance .",
    "a few faint unidentified objects appear when using the @xmath14-band point source mask because very red galaxies detected at  can be fainter than the completeness limit in the @xmath14-band image , and therefore remain unmasked .",
    "our measurements of residual power in the sky images were used as guidelines for determining the best value of the residual variance ( @xmath116 ) , which we determined by eliminating any radial trend in @xmath54 .    when radial gradients in @xmath54 could be attributed to residual variance , adopting a correction of @xmath51 of the sky value usually removed the effect . however , residual patterns were not always uniform , and low-@xmath20 ratio observations frequently showed variable radial behavior that could not be removed by simply subtracting a uniform residual variance .",
    "experience with our data showed that the best way to deal with the residual variance was to use the value of @xmath116 that removed a slope in @xmath54 when a clear trend exists , and to adopt a uniform correction of 0.1% of the sky level prior to sky subtraction when the radial behavior of @xmath54 was uncertain . minimizing the radial variation in @xmath54",
    "usually required a correction of @xmath117 at @xmath118 , or in general , @xmath119 .",
    "the lower the background noise , the smaller the required correction for residual variance .",
    "the sbf analysis was performed in the annular region that produced the cleanest power spectrum , and the residual variance correction @xmath116 was subtracted from the fluctuation power @xmath54 prior to computing the fluctuation magnitude ( in addition to any correction @xmath104 applied to account for faint globular clusters and galaxies ) .",
    "since the value of @xmath116 is only an estimate of the residual spatial variance , its associated uncertainty is large when @xmath116 is a significant fraction of @xmath54 .",
    "clumpy dust distributions can also add to the fluctuation power measured and cause the distance to the galaxy to be underestimated . by working at ,",
    "we minimize the effects of dust extinction .",
    "careful inspection of the  images revealed no evidence of patchy dust , and we made no additional correction to . if clumpy dust were present in significant quantities , we would expect it to be concentrated toward the center of the galaxy . the resulting sbf amplitude would decrease with radius , which is opposite the trend arising from the other sources of residual variance described in the previous paragraph . for our data ,",
    "we find that sbf amplitudes are larger in the outer annuli , and we conclude that patchy dust in the innermost regions of these galaxies does not affect the  sbf magnitude .",
    "we measured apparent fluctuation magnitudes  for five giant elliptical galaxies in the fornax cluster using the techniques described in section  [ howtosbf ] .",
    "the power spectra are shown in figure  [ powerspectra ] , along with the individual components of the fit @xmath120 and @xmath56 .",
    "two values of  are listed in tables  [ fornaxmbarskp ] and [ fornaxmbarsi ] for each galaxy : the magnitudes in table  [ fornaxmbarskp ] were derived using the  data alone ; the magnitudes in table  [ fornaxmbarsi ] were determined using the @xmath14-band images to identify and remove faint gcs and galaxies .",
    "we compared the fluctuation magnitudes measured using the two different masks in figure  [ imaskvskmask ] .",
    "in the first set of  magnitudes ( table  [ fornaxmbarskp ] ) , we fitted the background galaxy and gc luminosity functions and integrated them to compute the power @xmath104 from objects fainter than the completeness limit .",
    "because of the high background , the  observations only sample the brightest gcs and galaxies ( fig .",
    "[ likefig2 ] ) , and @xmath104 was frequently a significant fraction of the total power @xmath54 . when @xmath121 exceeds @xmath122 , the uncertainty in the sbf magnitude from the gc and galaxy contribution becomes the dominant source of error .",
    "we did not apply an additional residual variance correction @xmath116 because of the significant uncertainty in @xmath104 , thus the uncertainties listed in table  [ fornaxmbarskp ] are not directly comparable to those in table  [ fornaxmbarsi ] .    for the second set of fluctuation magnitudes ( table  [ fornaxmbarsi ] ) , the deeper @xmath14-band images were used to identify and mask gcs and galaxies , and we assumed that their contribution to  is negligible ( @xmath123 ) . as was shown in section  [ imasks ] for ngc  1399 ,",

    "if this is the case , all cepheid distances need to be increased by @xmath179 , although the exact change may depend on metallicity corrections to the period - luminosity relation for cepheid variables ( madore & freedman 1997 ) .",

    "the brighter @xmath14-band fluctuation magnitudes observed in the outer regions of ngc  3379 may be consistent with this scenario if the change is  is principally due to a decrease in metallicity ; in ngc  205 the change in  must be due to age differences between the populations .",
    "pahre & mould ( 1994 ) observed no radial gradient in the @xmath13-band fluctuation magnitude in ngc  3379 , but a modest gradient may be hidden in the scatter of the individual measurements .    while the prospects for using ir sbfs to reveal radial gradients in stellar populations are good",
    ", the data presented here do not have a sufficiently high @xmath20 ratio to detect radial changes in fluctuation amplitude ; the uncertainties due to background subtraction and estimated residual variance mask the modest changes in  that might result from differences in stellar populations within a galaxy .",
    "if the outer regions of an elliptical galaxy are older and more metal - poor than the center , the  fluctuation amplitude will decrease with radius . in our data",
    ", uncorrected fluctuation amplitudes usually increase with radius , sometimes changing by a factor of two . even if we could imagine a scenario that creates a galaxy with the older stars at the center , the variations in stellar population that would be required to explain such large changes in fluctuation amplitude are not plausible .",
    "instead , we interpret the observed sbf gradients in our data to be indicators of residual variations in the sky background",
    ".    using ir sbfs to reach definitive conclusions regarding stellar population gradients in nearby galaxies will require high-@xmath20 ratio data in which corrections for residual variance are negligible .",
    "although we have not conclusively measured ir sbf gradients it should be emphasized that the breaking of the age and metallicity degeneracy potentially makes ir sbfs a powerful probe for distinguishing old , metal - poor populations from younger , metal - rich stars .",
    "for example , the range in v - i  in ngc  205 should give rise to a change in  of @xmath244 mag , with  becoming fainter with radius .",
    "if an ir sbf gradient were detected in ngc  3379 , we could explain the very different optical sbf properties of these two galaxies in terms of the ages and metallicities of the stellar populations .",
    "we have completed a  ( 2.1  ) survey of surface brightness fluctuations in 16 giant elliptical galaxies in the virgo , fornax , and eridanus clusters .",
    "we also observed m31 and m32 in the @xmath180 and @xmath181 bands . from this study",
    "we draw the following conclusions :    @xmath13-band sbfs can be measured reliably and used to determine distances to early - type galaxies . because sbfs are relatively bright in the ir and the seeing is typically very good , integration times can be quite modest . however , observations must be sufficiently deep to adequately sample the gc luminosity function and remove sources of residual variance .",
    "low-@xmath20 ratio measurements are unreliable .",
    "optical images can be used to identify and remove gcs and background galaxies that are not detected in the ir , improving the ir sbf measurement .",
    "we empirically calibrated the  sbf distance scale using cepheid distances to m31 and the virgo cluster .",
    "the absolute  fluctuation magnitude is @xmath245 ( statistical error ) with a total uncertainty of 0.12 mag .",
    "no significant change in  with v - i  was observed over the range in color spanned by the galaxies in this sample .",
    "accurate color measurements are not required to measure the  sbf distance to a galaxy .",
    "sbf magnitudes are consistent with predictions from simple stellar population models .",
    "the lack of a correlation in  with v - i  is best explained by a spread in ages among the galaxies observed .",
    "the redder ellipticals are consistent with 12 to 17 gyr stellar population models , while the bluer galaxies in our sample must have younger 5 to 8 gyr populations .",
    "metallicities appear to vary less than ages , with the typical galaxy having [ fe / h]=@xmath246 .",
    "the stellar population models show that the age - metallicity degeneracy is broken with @xmath13-band sbfs , allowing one to distinguish between old , metal - poor and young , metal - rich populations . examining the radial variation in ir sbfs will help distinguish between different galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "our observations do not agree with the relationship between  and the 2   index predicted by the stellar population models .",
    "we are especially indebted to guy worthey for providing the custom  stellar population models and the @xmath13-band k corrections .",
    "many sections of this paper were strengthened by the addition of his models .",
    "we also thank john tonry and his collaborators for allowing us to use @xmath14-band images from their sbf survey to identify and remove globular clusters and background galaxies from our  images .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge helpful conversations with michael pahre and michael liu .",
