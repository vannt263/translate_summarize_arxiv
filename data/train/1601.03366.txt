    "the interest in the physics of heavy quarkonia was spurred , more than a decade ago , by the discovery of the exotic meson @xmath0  @xcite , whose physical properties do not fit in the historically well - succeeded quark model . soon after , a new `` particle zoo '' of exotic particles was uncovered by several collaborations around the world . the challenge imposed by the so - called @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 states triggered alternative explanations for their structures , such as tetraquarks , molecules , gluonic excitations , mixtures , and others  @xcite .",
    "the latest discoveries of charged mesons in the charmonium and bottomonium sectors put in check explanations based on either the conventional quark model , or hybrids of charmonium and gluonic excitations since , besides the @xmath7 pair , two additional quarks must exist to provide the charge of these states .",
    "these recent findings highlight the complexities of the strong force in its non - perturbative regime , with the promise of improve our understanding about the emergence of confinement in qcd .    despite the large amount of theoretical investigations in the literature ,",
    "very little is known about the @xmath0 structure ( denoted by @xmath4 from now on ) .",
    "however , the purely molecular interpretation is very appealing , since it has a mass remarkably close to the @xmath8 threshold  @xcite and its small width is not easily accommodated in the conventional quarkonium picture . on the experimental side , only recently the @xmath4 quantum numbers were confirmed as @xmath9 by the lhcb collaboration  @xcite .",
    "this result practically rules out any conventional charmonium explanation , albeit not enough to distinguish among the remaining exotic possibilities .",
    "swanson , in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggested looking at the @xmath4 radiative decays into @xmath10 and @xmath11 as one of the promising tests for its molecular nature .",
    "his molecular model calculation includes both neutral and charged @xmath12 states , decaying to a photon via light quark annihilation , and smaller components of @xmath13 and @xmath14 decaying to a photon via vector - meson dominance .",
    "he obtains @xmath15  kev and @xmath16  kev .",
    "his quark model calculations , though very sensitive to the detailed assumptions involved , give @xmath17-@xmath18  kev and @xmath19  kev . based on these results",
    ", the author claims that radiative decays , especially decaying into the @xmath20 channel ( here denoted by @xmath21 ) , would be a sharp test for the @xmath4 molecular nature . in 2009 babar",

    "later attempt to measure the same ratio was done by the belle collaboration .",
    "they could not find any signal though , setting only the upper limit @xmath24 at @xmath25 confidence level @xcite .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration reported @xmath26 , where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic @xcite .",
    "the latter concludes that the experimental result does not support the pure molecular picture , favoring charmonium  @xcite or mixtures of molecule and charmonium  @xcite .",
    "however this conclusion , which is based on the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , is disputable , as indicated by further calculations in the molecular approach .    using phenomenological meson lagrangians and assuming the @xmath4 to be a loosely - bound @xmath27 molecule , dong and collaborators  @xcite calculated the radiative decay @xmath28 , obtaining an upper limit of @xmath29 , compatible with some quark model predictions  @xcite .",
    "their calculation is not very sensitive to variations on the binding energy , but depends on their form - factor parameter @xmath30 .",
    "they conclude that their decay width is fully compatible with a predominantly molecular nature of x , allowing a very small admixture of @xmath31 . in a latter work",
    "@xcite , the same authors addressed , besides a couple of hadronic decays , radiative decays into both @xmath32 and @xmath21 channels .",
    "their values for the ratio @xmath33 were compared against the experimental one available at the time , from babar  @xcite . with essentially the same molecular approach used before  @xcite , but with different quark model approaches for their @xmath7 component , they find a subtle interplay between these two components , depending on the @xmath7 model and the @xmath4 binding energy .",
    "guo _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the imprints of the long - distance @xmath12 molecular structure of @xmath4 on the radiative decays @xmath28 ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) , with an effective field theory approach .",
    "contrary to  @xcite , they conclude that the radiative decays do not allow one to draw conclusions about the nature of the @xmath4 .",
    "however , their analysis focus only at the long - distance loop contributions to the radiative amplitude , without explicitly considering the short - distance contributions , parametrized as contact - like interactions in the effective lagrangian .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to perform a proper renormalization - group analysis of both loop and contact contributions to these radiative decays , therefore , complementing the studies of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we adopt here a different prescription to regularize the loop integrals , the power - divergence subtraction ( pds ) scheme  @xcite . devised to handle the non - perturbative aspect of the nucleon - nucleon interaction , it soon became an alternative regularization method in other non - perturbative systems such as cold - atoms , exotic mesons , and nuclear clusters  @xcite . based on dimensional regularization , the method consists of subtractions , beyond the @xmath37 dimensions of the usual modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath38 ) scheme , at lower dimensions to account for power - law divergences  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding amplitude reads @xmath84 as pointed out in  @xcite , the necessity of having this term to cancel the divergences of the loop diagrams means that the @xmath4 radiative decays are sensitive to both its long- and short - distance structure , making them unsuitable as probes exclusively of the former . nevertheless , renormalization - group techniques can be used to estimate the strength of the short - range interactions at a limited range of energy scale .",
    "this is the main goal of this work . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the strength of diagram @xmath82 after renormalization , @xmath85 , was set to zero .",
    "we take advantage of the most recent experimental value of @xmath33 by the lhcb collaboration to obtain the renormalized values of @xmath85 in both @xmath32 and @xmath21 channels .",
    "the partial width of the @xmath4 radiative decay , when the initial and final polarization states are not measured , is given by @xmath86 where the total amplitude squared reads @xmath87 we made use of the mathematica software to deal with contractions of the lorentz indices and algebraic manipulations .",
    "the loop integrals in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mloop ] ) were handled with the usual feynman parametrizations , with the remaining integrations solved numerically with a gauss - legendre quadrature .    in order to estimate qualitatively the importance of short - distance physics , we first compute the ratio @xmath33 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) considering only the long - range loop diagrams @xmath39-@xmath40 , which we shall denote by @xmath88 . at this point",
    "the analysis is similar to the one from ref .",
    "it is evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mloop ] ) that , in this case , the dependence on @xmath89 is cancelled in the ratio @xmath88 .",
    "however , @xmath88 remains very sensitive to the ratio @xmath90 , which is poorly known . from the leptonic decay widths of @xmath32 and @xmath21 , ref .",
    "@xcite obtains @xmath91 , which is the central value that we adopt .",
    "we allow a variation around the natural band @xmath92 , which should account for uncertainties in both phenomenological extraction as well as renormalization evolution of this ratio .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] shows @xmath88 as a function of the renormalization scale @xmath93 .",
    "we choose the interval @xmath94 , not too far from @xmath95 , the relevant scale of the problem . the dashed ( blue ) curve essentially reproduces the results of ref .",
    "the solid ( red ) curve is our result , with the loop integrals regularized within the pds scheme .",
    "the ( gray ) horizontal band is the lhcb experimental value  @xcite , with uncertainties added in quadrature .",
    "though these results are quite different from each other and not yet properly renormalized , one is still able to refute the conclusions from ref .",
    "@xcite , that a ratio @xmath33 much larger than @xmath96 would disfavor a molecular nature of @xmath4 .",
    "regarding the behavior of these two different curves , a few comments are in order .",
    "first , since @xmath33 is an observable , it should not depend on @xmath93 .",
    "therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios ] indicates the need of proper renormalization .",
    "second , we draw attention to the logarithmic scale of the figure . in the pds scheme adopted here , the dependence of @xmath88 on the renormalization scale @xmath93 is much stronger than in  @xcite , which uses the standard @xmath38-scheme .",
    "this is somehow expected , since pds - regulated loops take into account power divergences that are set to zero in @xmath38 .",
    "power divergences lead to a richer structure in the renormalization - group ( rg ) evolution path , allowing the existence of a non - trivial fixed point  @xcite that describes the non - perturbative aspects of weakly - bound systems .",
    "such rg constraints can induce a larger dependence of the short - distance contact couplings @xmath97 s on @xmath93 , as shown in the following .",
    "most of power divergences come from magnetic interactions , c.f .",
    "( 24)(28 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , meaning that they are more sensitive to short - distance physics .",
    "note that there are a few examples in weakly - bound nuclear systems where the short - distance sensitivity of magnetic interactions is also observed  see , for instance , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the previous discussion points to the need of including explicitly the contact interactions from diagram @xmath82 and perform a proper rg analysis . for practical reasons ,",
    "we find more convenient to impose the rg - constraint on the decay width , that is , @xmath98 this condition is imposed , numerically , on each decay channel @xmath10 and @xmath99 , tied to the experimental constraint @xmath100  @xcite .",
    "since both @xmath36 and @xmath101 , contrary to their ratio , are not well - determined , we choose a few representative values of @xmath101 as initial boundary condition in our rg - equation  ( [ eq : rg - cond ] ) .",
    "one finds two sets of solutions for the @xmath93-dependent contact terms , @xmath102 and @xmath103 , which reflects the fact that we impose the rg - constraint essentially on the modulus - squared of the decay amplitude .",
    "we present only one of these sets , since the other leads to decay widths of the order of tenths of mev while the total decay width of the @xmath4 has an upper limit of @xmath104  mev  @xcite .",
    "we assume that all @xmath93-dependence is given by the couplings @xmath97 s , ignoring eventual @xmath93-dependences on the couplings @xmath89 and @xmath105 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : cterms ] we present our rg results for the short - distance couplings @xmath106 and @xmath103 . as indicated , the curves correspond to different values of @xmath101 . within the selected ranges of @xmath93 and @xmath101 ,",
    "one notices a smooth variation on @xmath102 , within @xmath107% , about the same relative error on @xmath33 reported by lhcb .",
    "we stress that the extraction of the couplings @xmath97 s depend on @xmath89 via eq .",
    "( [ eq : mloop ] ) and has a much larger relative theoretical uncertainty . on the other hand , @xmath103 exhibits a stronger variation with @xmath93 , meaning that @xmath36 is more sensitive to the short - distance physics not dynamically taken into account by our effective theory .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , from the eft point of view , short - distance physics means not only compact configurations like charmonium or tetraquark , but also heavier molecular states that are integrated - out from the effective theory , for instance , a virtual @xmath108 contribution .    to estimate",
    "the relevance of the short - distance interactions to @xmath4 radiative decays , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gterms ] only their contributions to the decay widths @xmath101 and @xmath36 , as well as the ratio @xmath33 .",
    "to qualitatively interpret these results , let us focus on the dash - dotted ( blue ) curve of @xmath101 .",
    "this has an input value of 60 kev .",
    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : gterms](a ) shows that its short - range interactions contribute about 200 kev .",
    "that implies a large cancellation between the long-(@xmath109 ) and short-(@xmath110 ) distance terms to generate the smaller width of 60 kev . in other words ,",
    "the interplay between @xmath109 and @xmath110 is of a delicate balance , both having the same importance to the decay .",
    "this is even more dramatic in the case of @xmath36 .",
    "such large cancellations between long- and short - distance terms may be a consequence of an underlying symmetry and is a question worth pursuing .",
    "we also checked that this qualitative cancellation holds for the @xmath38-regulated loops , as much as for @xmath101 but less dramatic for @xmath36 .",
    "the @xmath93-dependence shown in figure [ fig : gterms ] may also be relevant in guiding theoretical models for the short - distance part .    in eft approach ,",
    "representations of short - range physics as contact interactions mean that all dynamical effects not explicitly taken into account may be relevant only beyond the eft scale . that includes the opening of high momenta thresholds , leading to imaginary terms in the amplitude .",
    "therefore , the constraint that the short - range coulplings @xmath97 remain real - valued within the energy range of the effective theory assures that there are no opening of high - energy thresholds .",
    "however , one notices numerically the appearance of an imaginary part on @xmath97 in the evolution of our rg - equation  ( [ eq : rg - cond ] ) , depending on the initial conditions . choosing the range @xmath111 , to keep @xmath97 real",
    "one finds the restrictions @xmath112 though the precise values depend on the eft range , these numbers can be put to experimental scrutinity .",
