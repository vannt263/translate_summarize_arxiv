    "the static properties of baryons are an important testing ground for qcd based calculations in the confinement region . however , different cqms@xcite are able to obtain a comparable good description of the low energy data , so that it is difficult to discriminate among them .",
    "a fundamental aspect of the theoretical description is the introduction of terms in the quark hamiltonian which violate the underlying @xmath0symmetry .",
    "it is therefore important to find out observables which are sensitive to the various su(6)-breaking mechanisms .    in this respect ,",
    "the relation proposed recently by goeke , polyakov and vanderhaeghen @xcite between the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron and the proton momentum fractions carried by valence quarks , @xmath1 , might be a good candidate for testing su(6)-breaking effects and can lead to important constraints on the models for the structure of the nucleon .",
    "quark models are able to reproduce in a extraordinary way the static low energy properties of baryons with very few parameters and this gives us confidence that they are a good effective representation of the low energy strong interaction dynamics .",
    "the qcd based parton model reproduces in a beautiful way the @xmath2 dependence of the high energy properties even with naive input .",
    "however the perturbative approach to qcd does not provide absolute values of the observables ; one can only relate data at different momentum scales .",
    "the description based on the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the qcd evolution require the input of non - perturbative matrix elements which have to be predetermined @xcite and therefore the parton distributions are usually obtained in a phenomenological way from fits to deep inelastic lepton nucleon scattering and drell - yan processes .",
    "the basic steps are to find a parametrization @xcite which is appropriate at a sufficiently large momentum @xmath3 , where it is expected that perturbation theory is applicable , and then qcd evolution techniques are used in order to obtain the parton distribution at higher @xmath2 . using these parametrizations a large body of data",
    "is reasonably described , even if at the origin this parametrization is purely phenomenological .",
    "gluck , reya and vogt @xcite started from a parametrized distribution of partons at a very low scale @xmath4 , which resembles that of a naive quark model of hadron structure , in the sense that the contribution of the valence quarks to the structure function is dominant .",
    "as suggested by parisi and petronzio @xcite , the hadronic @xmath5 scale is defined such that the fraction of the total momentum carried by the valence quarks is unity .",
    "this procedure opens the possibility of using constituent quark models as input in order to calculate the nonperturbative ( twist - two ) nucleon matrix elements , as proposed by jaffe and ross @xcite .",
    "the scheme developed by traini et al.@xcite takes into account all these aspects : it uses as input the quark model results in order to determine the non perturbative matrix elements at the hadronic scale @xcite , then an upwards nlo evolution procedure at high momentum transfer ( @xmath6  gev@xmath7 ) is performed@xcite .    starting from three different constituent quark models @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated the parton distributions at the hadronic scale and we have evaluated the ratio of the proton momentum fractions carried by valence quarks . a nlo evolution has been performed up to @xmath8  gev@xmath7 .",
    "all models give a good description of the spectrum and have been used also to describe various observables ( elastic and inelastic form factors , strong decays ) . in particular , the different results for the electromagnetic transition form factors indicate that the models have a quite different @xmath2-behaviour .",
    "however , as we shall see later , the ratio of the proton momentum fractions carried by valence quarks is independent of the scale @xmath2 , therefore we expect that the study of this relation will give important information on general aspect of cqm .    the paper is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "we review in a critical way the new relation as found in ref .",
    "@xcite between the ratio of the anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron and the ratio of the proton momentum fractions @xmath1 . in section 3 the unpolarized parton distributions",

    "4 the ratio of the proton momentum fractions carried by valence quarks is calculated as a function of @xmath2 and compared with experimental values and with the results of the models for the ratio of the anomalous magnetic moments .",
    "@xcite , a relation has been proposed between the ratio of the proton and neutron anomalous magnetic moments and the momentum fractions carried by valence @xmath9- and @xmath10-quark distributions , as follows  : @xmath11 with the proton momentum fraction carried by the valence quarks defined as @xmath12 + in fig .",
