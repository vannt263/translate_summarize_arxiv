    "blazars have been shown to exhibit a sequence of properties as a function of source power ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) . as the source power increases , the emission line luminosity and the ratio of compton to synchrotron luminosity increase , while the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath0 and the ic peak frequency decrease .",
    "recent multiwavelength studies support this scheme ( e.g. kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) , although the result that the ratio of the compton to synchrotron luminosity increases with source luminosity suffers from limited statistics , and should be only considered tentative .",
    "the initial division of blazars into flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) and bl lacertae objects ( bls ) was based on the equivalent width ( ew ) of the broad emission lines .",
    "sources with ew @xmath1 5 @xmath2 were classified as fsrqs and sources with ew @xmath3 5 @xmath2 as bls .",
    "this difference in the ew of the emission lines has been interpreted as absence of a substantial blr in bls , and has been used to advance the idea that in bls the gev - tev emission is due to ssc , while in fsrqs the gev emission is due to ec .",
    "however , the ew criterion does not correspond to a dichotomy ( scarpa & falomo 1997 ) , because a weak blr is present in bls as well .",
    "additionally , it is not the blr luminosity @xmath4 that is relevant for the ec luminosity , but the blr photon energy density @xmath5 that is measured in the comoving frame of the non - thermal source .",
    "one needs to know not only @xmath4 , but also the blr radius @xmath6 and the location of the non - thermal emitter relative to the blr in order to quantify the relative importance of ssc versus ec emission .",
    "the size of the blr has been measured only for radio quiet agns through reverberation mapping ( kaspi et al .",
    "2000 ) , and it has been found to scale with the ionizing luminosity @xmath7 of the acrretion disk as @xmath8 . it was additionally found that , assuming keplerian motions for the blr clouds , the mass of the central object scales with the ionizing luminosity as @xmath9 .",
    "here we assume the scalings apply also to radio loud agn and examine the implications for blazars .",
    "following the formalism of internal shocks propagating in a conical jet ( rees 1978 ) , we scale the location @xmath10 and the radius @xmath11 of the non - thermal spherical emitter with the mass @xmath12 of the central object .",
    "we assume that @xmath4 is a fraction of @xmath7 and scale the kinetic luminosity and the poynting flux of the blob with @xmath7 .",
    "under this scheme , the radius of the blr scales as @xmath13 , and the distance of the blob from the center of the system scales as @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , we assume that for powerful sources the blob radiates from inside the blr , @xmath15 .",
    "however , if we consider increasingly weaker sources , @xmath6 falls faster than @xmath10 and , below some critical luminosity , the blob radiates from outside the blr . for a blob inside the blr , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the bulk motion lorents factor of the blob . for a blob outside the blr , the solid angle subtended by the blr , as seen by the blob ,",
    "is reduced .",
    "this affects @xmath5 in two ways .",
    "the first is the usual geometric @xmath18 factor , and the second is a relativistic de - boosting that , for @xmath19 , gives @xmath20 ( dermer & schlickeiser 1994 ) . the second effect dominates if the blob is located less than a few @xmath6 away from the blr .",
    "for example , for @xmath21 , @xmath22 at a distance of @xmath23 is smaller than @xmath22 inside the blr by a factor of @xmath24 due to the usual @xmath18 and by a factor of @xmath25 due to relativistic de - boosting .",
    "we apply this scaling using a model ( georganopoulos & kirk 2000 ) for the blob which includes both particle acceleration and radiative losses with ic scattering losses treated in the thomson regime .",
    "particles are accelerated in an acceleration zone and escape into a radiation zone , before they eventually escape out of the system .",
    "this simplified picture is intended to represent particles which are accelerated by a shock front , escape it , and radiate downstream before the compressed plasma re - expands .",
    "whilst undergoing acceleration , particles simultaneously suffer synchrotron losses and losses by compton scattering of both photons of external origin ( ec ) and synchrotron photons ( ssc ) from the radiation zone . in the radiation zone ,",
    "ec , ssc and synchrotron losses occur until the particle finally escapes after a time @xmath26 . the electron energy distribution ( eed ) is computed self - consistently , taking account of these processes .    our assumption about the scaling of the poynting flux implies a constant magnetic field , which we take to be @xmath27 g. the blob",
    "is assumed to move with a lorentz factor @xmath28 at an angle @xmath29 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "low energy particles ( @xmath30 ) are injected into the blob at a rate of @xmath31 @xmath32 s@xmath33 .",
    "also @xmath34 . for @xmath35 erg s@xmath33 ,",
    "reverberation mapping gives @xmath36 cm .",
    "we assume that at this luminosity @xmath37 and @xmath38 cm .    in fig.1 , we let @xmath7 vary from @xmath39 erg s @xmath33 to @xmath40 erg s@xmath33 , and follow the behavior of the system . in the lower panel @xmath6 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11",
    "are plotted as a function of @xmath7 . for weak sources ,",
    "the blob is located outside the blr ( @xmath41 ) . as the source power increases , the blob gradually approaches and eventually enters the blr . in the middle panel of fig.1",
    "we see how this affects @xmath22 ( the magnetic field energy density @xmath42 is constant under the adopted scaling ) . for weak sources ,",
    "@xmath22 is much smaller than both @xmath42 and the self - consistently derived synchrotron photon density @xmath43 .",
    "gradually @xmath22 increases , and eventually , for bright sources , dominates over both @xmath42 and @xmath43 . in the upper panel of fig.1",
    "we plot the self - consistently derived break @xmath44 in the eed .",
    "note that @xmath44 decreases as the power of the source decreases .    in fig.2",
    "we plot basic observable quantities as a function of @xmath7 . in the lower panel",
    "we plot the synchrotron luminosity @xmath45 , the ssc luminosity @xmath46 , and the ec luminosity @xmath47 . at low powers",
    ", @xmath48 is much weaker than @xmath46 and @xmath45 that are roughly equal .",
    "as the source power increases , @xmath48 gradually dominates over @xmath46 and @xmath45 , and we end up with an ec dominated source . in the middle panel we plot the peak frequencies of the three emission components . note how the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath49 decreases as the source power increases .",
    "similar behavior is also seen for the ssc peak frequency @xmath50 and the ec peak frequency @xmath51 .",
    "finally in the upper panel of fig.1 we plot the ratio @xmath52 ( solid line ) of the synchrotron to accretion disk luminosity and the ratio @xmath53 of the ic luminosity to synchrotron luminosity .",
    "@xmath45 dominates over @xmath7 in weak sources in agreement with the lack of a thermal component and weak emission lines in weak sources like bls .",
    "@xmath7 becomes more significant for powerful sources , again in agreement with the strong emission lines of fsrqs and the accretion disk signature observed in some fsrqs ( e.g. in 3c 279 , pian et al 1999 ) .",
    "the dominance of the compton over the synchrotron emission increases as the source power increases , in agreement with observations ( e.g. kubo et al .",
    "note , however , that the observational case for an increasing compton dominance with source power is based on poor statistics due to the limited sensitivity of the _",
    "cgro_.    in fig.3 we plot the synchrotron luminosity @xmath54 versus the synchrotron peak frequency @xmath55 for the blazars studied by sambruna , maraschi & urry ( 1996 ) and kubo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . on top of the data points we plot the model tracks as a function of @xmath7 for a range of observing angles .",
    "note that these tracks represent two model derived quantities , @xmath45 and @xmath49 as @xmath7 varies .",
    "the model covers rather well the observed parameter space .",
    "given the track of the model under an angle @xmath56 , we do not expect that any powerful ( @xmath57 erg s@xmath33 ) sources with high peak frequencies @xmath58 hz exist .",
    "the discovery of such sources would pose a serious problem for this model .",
    "in fig.4 we plot the peak luminosities of the three emission mechanisms for 5 model sources with @xmath7 ranging from @xmath39 up to @xmath40 erg s@xmath33 .",
    "the behavior of the model is in good agreement with the general characteristics of the observed luminosity sequence ( compare with fig.12 of fossati et al .",
    "the synchrotron peak frequency decreases from @xmath59 hz down to @xmath60 hz , as the synchrotron power increases .",
    "the compton peak frequency in weak sources is in the tev regime ( @xmath61 hz ) and it is due to ssc , while in powerful sources it is in the gev regime ( @xmath62 hz ) and it is due to ec .",
    "according to the model , although in these bright sources the energy losses are dominated by ec , the hard x - ray emission is due to ssc , in agreement with resent observations ( kubo et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we note here that fig.4 corresponds to sources that are oriented at an angle @xmath29 . in reality one should expect a range of angles , which will give rise to significant scattering around the presented trend .",
    "this scattering is visible in the work of fossati et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and indicates that a proper unification scheme for blazars should include the effects of orientation ."
