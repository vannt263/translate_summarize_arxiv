    "recently , a renormalizable gravity theory in four dimensions which reduces to einstein gravity with a non - vanishing cosmological constant in the infrared ( ir ) energy scale ( corresponding to large distances ) , but with improved ultraviolet ( uv ) energy scale behaviors ( corresponding to very small distances ) , was proposed by hoava @xcite . quantum field theory has had considerable success experimentally , but from a theoretical point of view it predicts infinite values for physical quantities .",
    "thus for certain feynman diagrams containing loops , the calculations leads to an infinite result .",
    "this is known as the ultraviolet divergence of quantum field theory , because small loop sizes correspond to high energies .",
    "infra - red divergence is the divergence caused by the low energy behavior of a quantum theory .",
    "the hoava theory admits a lifshitz scale - invariance in time and space , exhibiting a broken lorentz symmetry at short scales , while at large distances higher derivative terms do not contribute , and the theory reduces to standard general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "the hoava theory has received a great deal of attention and since its formulation various properties and characteristics have been extensively analyzed , ranging from formal developments @xcite , cosmology @xcite , dark energy @xcite and dark matter @xcite , spherically symmetric or rotating solutions @xcite , to the weak field observational tests @xcite . at large distances",
    ", higher derivative terms do not contribute and the theory reduces to standard general relativity if a particular coupling @xmath4 , which controls the contribution of the trace of the extrinsic curvature has a specific value .",
    "indeed , @xmath4 is running , and if @xmath5 is an ir fixed point , standard general relativity is recovered . therefore , although a generic vacuum of the theory is the anti - de sitter one , particular limits of the theory allow for the minkowski vacuum , a physical state characterized by the absence of ordinary ( baryonic ) matter . in this limit",
    "post - newtonian coefficients coincide with those of pure gr .",
    "thus , the deviations from conventional gr can be tested only beyond the post - newtonian corrections , that is for a system with strong gravity at astrophysical scales .    in this context",
    ", ir - modified hoava gravity seems to be consistent with the current observational data , but in order to test its viability more observational constraints are necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite , potentially observable properties of black holes in the hoava - lifshitz gravity with minkowski vacuum were considered , namely , the gravitational lensing and quasinormal modes .",
    "quasinormal modes are the modes of energy dissipation of a perturbed object or field .",
    "black holes have many quasinormal modes that describe the exponential decrease of asymmetry of the black hole in time as it evolves towards the spherical shape .",
    "it was shown that the bending angle is seemingly smaller in the considered hoava - lifshitz gravity than in gr , and the quasinormal modes of black holes are longer lived , and have larger real oscillation frequency in hoava - lifshitz gravity than in gr . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by adopting the strong field limit approach , the properties of strong field gravitational lensing for the hrava - lifshitz black hole were considered , and the angular position and magnification of the relativistic images were obtained .",
    "compared with the reissner - norstrm black hole , a significant difference in the parameters was found .",
    "thus , it was argued that this may offer a way to distinguish a deformed hrava - lifshitz black hole from a reissner - nordstrm black hole . in general relativity",
    "the reissner - nordstrm black hole solution describes the gravitational field of a charged black hole . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the behavior of the effective potential was analyzed , and the timelike geodesic motion in the hoava - lifshitz spacetime was also explored . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the basic physical properties of matter forming a thin accretion disk in the vacuum spacetime metric of the hoava - lifshitz gravity models were considered .",
    "it was shown that significant differences as compared to the general relativistic case exist , and that the determination of these observational quantities could discriminate , at least in principle , between standard gr and hoava - lifshitz theory , and constrain the parameter of the model .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to consider the classical tests ( perihelion precession , light bending , and the radar echo delay , respectively ) of general relativity for static gravitational fields in the framework of hoava - lifshitz gravity . to do this",
    "we shall adopt for the geometry outside a compact , stellar type object ( the sun ) , the static and spherically symmetric metric obtained by kehagias and sfetsos @xcite . for the kehagias and sfetsos ( ks ) metric",
    ", we first consider the motion of a particle ( planet ) , and analyze the perihelion precession .",
    "in addition to this , by considering the motion of a photon in the static ks field , we study the bending of light by massive astrophysical objects and the radar echo delay , respectively .",
    "all these gravitational effects can be explained in the framework of the ks geometry .",
    "existing data on light - bending around the sun , using long - baseline radio interferometry , ranging to mars using the viking lander , the perihelion precession of mercury , and recent lunar laser ranging results can all give significant and detectable solar system constraints , associated with hoava - lifshitz gravity .",
    "more exactly , the study of the classical general relativistic tests , constrain the parameter of the solution .",
    "we will also compare our results with the phenomenological constraints on the kehagias - sfetsos solution from solar system orbital motions obtained in @xcite . in order to obtain reliable constraints on the parameter of the model",
    ", the analysis must not be limited to the perihelion precession of the planet mercury , but it should be extended to take into account the other recent observational data on the perihelion precession of the other planets of the solar system .    in the context of the classical tests of gr",
    "the dadhich , maartens , papadopoulos and rezania ( dmpr ) solution of the spherically symmetric static vacuum field equations in brane world models was also extensively analyzed @xcite .",

    "tighter constraints are established by the inner planets for which @xmath185 @xcite . however , in order to obtain a better precision from these data , a full general relativistic study is needed , as well as a significant improvement in the determination of the values of the orbital periods of the exoplanets .    thus , the gravitational dynamics of the ks solution is determined by the free parameter @xmath0 . in order to explain the observational effects in the solar system , @xmath0 must have an extremely small value , of the order of a few @xmath186 cm@xmath108 .",
    "therefore the explanation of the classical tests of gr must require a very precise fine tuning of this constant at the level of the solar system .",
    "it is also very important for future observations to determine if @xmath0 is a local quantity or a universal constant . by assuming that @xmath0 is a universal constant",

    "the study of the classical tests of general relativity provide a very powerful method for constraining the allowed parameter space of the hoava - lifshitz gravity solutions , and to provide a deeper insight into the physical nature and properties of the corresponding spacetime metrics .",

    "<S> in the present paper we consider the possibility of observationally constraining hoava gravity at the scale of the solar system , by considering the classical tests of general relativity ( perihelion precession of the planet mercury , deflection of light by the sun and the radar echo delay ) for the spherically symmetric black hole kehagias - sfetsos solution of hoava - lifshitz gravity . </S>",
    "<S> all these gravitational effects can be fully explained in the framework of the vacuum solution of hoava gravity . moreover , the study of the classical general relativistic tests also constrain the free parameter of the solution . from the analysis of the perihelion precession of the planet mercury we obtain for the free parameter @xmath0 of the kehagias - sfetsos solution the constraint @xmath1 , the deflection of light by the sun gives @xmath2 , while the radar echo delay observations can be explained if the value of @xmath0 satisfies the constraint @xmath3 . </S>"
