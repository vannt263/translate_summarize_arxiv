    "the ( fermionic ) hubbard model has attracted considerable attention as a model for describing correlated electrons in solids . despite its apparent simplicity , it is difficult to analyze the model in a consistent way , and exact and/or rigorous results are very limited  @xcite .",
    "a number of approximate treatments have been developed to understand the model . a systematic approach from the large-@xmath0 limit of the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model",
    "was initiated by affleck and marston in the context of high - temperature superconductivity  @xcite . in this approach , the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry used",
    "is just a theoretical tool rather than a physical reality .",
    "therefore , the model at finite @xmath0 did not attract much attention and was much less studied .",

    "these systems were later realized experimentally using ultracold yb atoms  @xcite . the enlarged symmetry of the system results from the hyperfine spin degrees of freedom . in the large-@xmath1 limit , these models with @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) atoms per site reduce to su(@xmath0 ) spin hamiltonians in which a variety of exotic states including chiral spin liquids are found to be ground states  @xcite .    in this paper , we present an extension of nagaoka s theorem  @xcite .",
    "the original theorem is the first rigorous result about the ferromagnetism in the hubbard model .",
    "nagaoka proved that when there is exactly one hole , the ferromagnetic state is the ground state of the infinite-@xmath1 hubbard model if the lattice satisfies certain connectivity condition . a generalized version of this theorem with a simplified proof was given by tasaki  @xcite .",
    "a natural analogue of the nagaoka ferromagnetic state in a system with su(@xmath0 ) symmetry is a fully polarized state characterized by the young tableau having one row with @xmath9 boxes , where @xmath9 is the total number of fermions . in this paper",

    "sec : summary ] .",
    "we begin with the definition of the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model .",
    "let @xmath10 be a finite lattice of @xmath11 sites .",
    "the model is described by the following hamiltonian : @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) creates ( annihilates ) a fermion with flavor @xmath15 at site @xmath16 , and the number of fermions at site @xmath16 is defined by @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "the hopping matrix elements are arbitrary as long as they are real , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "although this requirement might look odd , @xmath21 can be achieved , in the case of bipartite lattices , by local gauge transformations ( @xmath22 ) for one sublattice .",
    "furthermore , it has recently been proposed that the sign change of the hopping matrix elements can be achieved by shaking optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "the second term @xmath23 is an arbitrary real valued function of the number operators @xmath24 .",
    "typical examples are on - site potentials and charge - charge interactions between any pair of sites . in cold atom systems ,",
    "an external harmonic trap is usually unavoidable .",
    "such a confinement term can be taken into account by setting @xmath25 where @xmath7 is the mass of atoms , @xmath26 is the trapping frequency , and @xmath27 is the position vector for the site @xmath16 . since we are concerned with the model on finite lattices , the expectation value of @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : trap ] ) in any state is finite provided that @xmath28 . the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) represents the on - site coulomb repulsion ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "let us first consider symmetries of the hamiltonian @xmath30 .",
    "in addition to the trivial conservation of the total number of fermions , the hamiltonian exhibits u(@xmath0 ) @xmath31 u(1)@xmath32su(@xmath0 ) symmetry . to see this",
    ", we define a set of number operators and flavor - raising , lowering operators as @xmath33 they satisfy the commutation relations @xmath34   = \\delta_{\\beta,\\gamma } f^{\\alpha,\\delta } - \\delta_{\\delta,\\alpha } f^{\\gamma,\\beta}$ ] , which follows from the relation @xmath35",

    "therefore it is concluded that the hamiltonian has a global u(@xmath0 ) @xmath31 u(1)@xmath32su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "as a side remark , we note that the restriction of the hamiltonian to the subspace where each site is occupied by at most two fermions has an enhanced symmetry  @xcite .",
    "moreover , this projected model in one dimension is exactly solvable by means of the bethe ansatz  @xcite .",
    "in this subsection , we introduce the notion of fully polarized states in the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model .",
    "since the numbers of @xmath15 fermions , @xmath42 , are conserved , the eigenstates of @xmath30 are separated into disconnected sectors labeled by the eigenvalues of @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . in what follows",

    "the off - diagonal operators @xmath38 ( @xmath45 ) play a role in connecting degenerate eigenstates in different subspaces .",
    "for instance , starting from a fully polarized state @xmath46 that is an eigenstate of @xmath30 in the subspace @xmath47 , one can obtain degenerate states with the same energy by applying @xmath38 repeatedly : @xmath48 where @xmath49 . note that we have assumed that @xmath50 , where @xmath9 is the total number of fermions .    to show that the above state is indeed the eigenstate",
    ", we shall prove by induction that the squared norm of @xmath51 is nonvanishing .",
    "we first set @xmath52 .",
    "then the statement is trivial because @xmath53 .",
    "next , we suppose that the squared norm of the state @xmath54 is nonvanishing",

    "using the above chain of relations , we obtain @xmath59 and find that the squared norm of @xmath60 is nonvanishing when @xmath61 . the desired result",
    "@xmath62 then follows by induction .",
    "the above argument ensures that the number of the states with the same energy as @xmath46 is at least @xmath63 this number coincides with the number of standard young tableaux having one row with @xmath9 boxes .",
    "when @xmath64 , @xmath65 , which is the number of ferromagnetic states in the su(2 ) hubbard model with @xmath9 fermions . in this paper , we will henceforth refer to states of the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol states ] ) as _ fully polarized _ states .",
    "we prove two generalizations of nagaoka s theorem in the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model .",
    "the first one is weaker and does not require the connectivity condition .",
    "however , this version of the theorem does not establish that the fully polarized states are the unique ground states .",
    "the second one is a strict extension of the original theorem in the su(2 ) hubbard model , which ensures the uniqueness of the ground states .",

    "we further assume that the model satisfies the connectivity condition .",
    "then the ground states are fully polarized states and are nondegenerate apart from the trivial @xmath70-fold degeneracy due to the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "[ thm : strict ]",
    "in this section we shall prove the theorems .",
    "we first define the basis we work with and clarify the connectivity condition under which theorem [ thm : strict ] holds .",

    "theorem [ thm : strict ] is proved as a consequence of the perron - frobenius theorem .      in the limit @xmath71 ,",
    "a state with a site occupied by two or more fermions has infinite energy .",

    ", we have assumed that the product is ordered according to an arbitrary order introduced in @xmath78 , and @xmath79 $ ] takes @xmath80 if @xmath16 is an odd - numbered position and @xmath81 otherwise .",
    "more explicitly , the states ( [ eq : basis states ] ) can be written as @xmath82 where the flavor configuration @xmath83 is defined by @xmath84 for the site @xmath16 and @xmath85 for all @xmath86 .",
    "it is noted that the collection of the states as well as form an orthonormal basis .",
    "since each number @xmath87 of fermions with flavor @xmath15 is a conserved quantity , the hilbert space @xmath72 can be further decomposed into subspaces labeled by @xmath88 with @xmath89 .",

    "we denote by @xmath90 $ ] the subspace with fixed @xmath88 .",
    "consider the matrix representation of @xmath30 in the basis defined by eq . .",

    "let @xmath95 be the flavor configuration on @xmath96 obtained from @xmath97 on @xmath98 by moving @xmath99 from @xmath100 to @xmath16 .",
    "one can easily see that @xmath75 and @xmath101 are directly connected if @xmath102 and @xmath103 , since we have @xmath104 here , we note that the negative sign is attributed to the sign factor in the definition of basis states .",
    "we also note that an off - diagonal matrix element of @xmath30 , i.e. , @xmath105 comes solely from the hopping term and is non - vanishing only if @xmath106 .    for two indices @xmath91 and @xmath92 , if there is a sequence of @xmath107 such that @xmath108 , we say @xmath91 and @xmath92 are connected and write @xmath109 .",
    "then the model is said to satisfy the connectivity condition if all indices corresponding to the basis states with common @xmath88 are connected with each other .",
    "_ remarks . _",
    "the direct connectivity @xmath110 implies that the hopping term of the hamiltonian @xmath30 transfers the hole from site @xmath16 to site @xmath100 and vice versa .",
    "similarly , the connectivity @xmath111 and @xmath112 implies that there is a hopping process by which the hole is exchanged between @xmath16 and @xmath100 . a simple sufficient condition for the connectivity condition in the su(2 ) case was found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the su(@xmath0 )",
    "case , however , it is more difficult to examine the connectivity condition for given hopping matrix @xmath113 and the number of flavors @xmath0 .",
    "this is because the connectivity condition of our model depends not only on @xmath113 but also on @xmath0",
    ". it may even happen that the model with @xmath0 less than a certain integer @xmath114 satisfies the connectivity condition but the one with @xmath115 does not ( e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : examples ] , we will give several examples where we can verify the connectivity condition explicitly .",
    "let @xmath116 be a ground state of @xmath30 , which is expanded as @xmath117 with certain coefficients @xmath118 .",

    "let us consider the expectation value of @xmath30 in @xmath46 .",
    "we first find that @xmath126 next , noting that @xmath127 which follows from @xmath128 for any flavor configurations @xmath97 , we get @xmath129 for the hopping term , we have @xmath130 here , we have used the schwarz inequality @xmath131 as a consequence of the relations obtained above , we find @xmath132 which shows that @xmath46 is also a ground state .",
    "then the theorem follows by taking @xmath46 as one of the ground states and using the global su(@xmath0 ) symmetry discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : full pol ] .         and",
    "@xmath2 are exchanged when the hole hops around the loop @xmath133 in the clockwise direction once . ]",
    "let us fix @xmath88 and consider the matrix representation of @xmath30 for the basis states @xmath134 in @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "then , as we noted below , all the off - diagonal matrix elements are non - positive .",
    "furthermore , the connectivity condition ensures that the matrix is indecomposable .",
    "therefore , the perron - frobenius theorem is applicable to the present matrix , implying that the lowest - energy state in the subspace @xmath135 $ ] is unique .",
    "this fact together with the statement of theorem 1 will complete the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "however , we give here a simple proof which relies only on the perron - frobenius theorem .",
    "we use another consequence of the perron - frobenius theorem : the lowest - energy state in each subspace is given by a certain linear combination of all @xmath134 with positive coefficients .",
    "let @xmath136 be the lowest - energy state with energy @xmath137 in the subspace where all fermions have flavor  1 . using the operators @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gene ] ) , one can construct the state with the same energy @xmath137 in the subspace @xmath135 $ ] as @xmath138 here note that the state can be expanded in terms of @xmath134 with positive coefficients .",
    "since the lowest - energy state in @xmath135 $ ] also has positive coefficients , it is not orthogonal to the state",
    ". therefore , the state is exactly the lowest - energy state in the subspace @xmath135 $ ] .",
    "this implies that the ground state is unique apart from the degeneracy due to the su(@xmath0 ) symmetry .",
    "in this section we give three examples where the connectivity condition can be verified explicitly . before proceeding ,",
    "let us introduce some terminology . a pair @xmath139 of sites in @xmath10",
    "is called a _ bond _ if @xmath102 . by a _ path _ from @xmath16 to @xmath100 ,",
    "we mean an ordered set @xmath140 of @xmath141  sites such that @xmath142 and @xmath143 is a bond for all @xmath144 .",
    "a path @xmath140 is called a _ loop _ if @xmath145 is a bond .",
    "a lattice @xmath10 is said to be connected if one can find a path for any two sites @xmath16 and @xmath100 in @xmath78 . a connected lattice @xmath10 is said to be two - fold connected , if one can not make it disconnected by removing a single site .",
    "the connectivity of @xmath78 implies that one can bring the hole to any site in @xmath78 by successive hops .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the connectivity of @xmath78 itself does not necessarily mean the connectivity of the model .",
    "this is because the motion of the hole around the lattice may not generate all the configurations @xmath146 with common @xmath147 .",
    "the first example is the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard hamiltonian on a closed chain , i.e. , the one - dimensional lattice @xmath148 with bonds @xmath149 and @xmath150 .",
    "it is , furthermore , assumed that there is one next nearest neighbor bond , say @xmath151 .",
    "let us take a fixed @xmath88 and examine the connectivity of indices @xmath75 in this subspace .",
    "since the lattice @xmath78 is obviously two - fold connected , one can bring the hole to any site .",
    "thus , one can fix the location of the hole , say @xmath152 , and see whether the motion of the hole generate all the flavor configurations @xmath153 in the subspace . for this purpose",
    ", we show below that , for any bond @xmath139 , @xmath153 and @xmath154 are connected , where @xmath155 is the flavor configuration obtained from @xmath97 by switching @xmath156 and @xmath99 .",
    "this property implies that one can generate any flavor configuration @xmath157 from @xmath97 by successively switching the flavors on a pair of neighboring sites in an appropriate way .",
    "let us assume that @xmath158 and @xmath159 . by letting the hole move around the closed chain in the clockwise direction @xmath160 times ,",
    "we first obtain the flavor configuration @xmath157 in which @xmath161 and @xmath162 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : chain ] ) .",
    "next we let the hole move around the triangle loop @xmath133 in the clockwise direction once , by which the flavor @xmath163 is exchanged with @xmath164 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : triangle ] ) . finally , by letting the hole move along the chain in the opposite(counter - clockwise ) direction @xmath160 times , we get the flavor configuration @xmath165 with @xmath166 without changing the flavor configuration outside @xmath167 .",
    "this proves that the model satisfies the connectivity condition .",
    "a few comments are in order : the presence of the single next - nearest - neighbor bond changes drastically the nature of ground states .",
    "in fact , in the purely one - dimensional chain in which the connectivity condition is not satisfied , all the flavor configurations become degenerate at @xmath68 in the same way as in the standard su(2 ) case  @xcite .",
    "this degeneracy is removed if @xmath168 and the ground states form a unique antisymmetric multiplet , which can be proved using the perron - frobenius argument  @xcite . in particular , the ground state is a unique su(@xmath0 ) singlet if the number of fermions is a multiple of @xmath0 .",
    "the second example is a class of models defined on two - fold connected lattices containing at least one triangle loop .",
    "typical examples are the triangular and kagome lattices .",
    "let us show that the model of this class satisfies the connectivity condition .",
    "let @xmath169 be a triangle loop , and let @xmath139 be an arbitrary bond in the lattice @xmath10 .",
    "since @xmath10 is connected , we can find a path from @xmath16 to @xmath170 and another path from @xmath100 to @xmath171 .",
    "suppose that these two paths share the same site @xmath172 and one can not find other paths that do not intersect .",
    "then , the removal of the site @xmath172 makes @xmath10 disconnected .",
    "this contradicts the fact that @xmath78 is two - fold connected .",
    "thus one can always find two non - intersecting paths ; one from @xmath16 to @xmath170 and the other from @xmath100 to @xmath171 .",
    "it follows from this that there is a loop containing two bonds @xmath173 and @xmath139 in @xmath10 . noting that @xmath173 belongs to the triangle loop",
    ", we can repeat the same argument as in the previous example , which concludes that the connectivity condition is satisfied in the model .      in the previous two examples",
    ", the existence of a loop of three sites plays an important role in establishing the connectivity condition .",
    "it is then natural to ask whether the connectivity condition is satisfied or not in a model on a lattice without any triangle .",
    "however , it seems difficult to answer this question in a general setting . here",
    ", we instead give a concrete example : the model on a lattice consisting only of loops of length four .",
    "our lattice @xmath78 can be constructed as follows .",
    "let @xmath174 be a loop of four sites having four bonds .",
    "let @xmath175 with @xmath176 be identical copies of @xmath174 .",
    "we construct @xmath177 by adding @xmath178 to @xmath179 in such a way that @xmath180 and @xmath178 share one bond . similarly , we construct @xmath181 by adding @xmath175 to @xmath182 in such a way that @xmath175 shares at least one bond with @xmath182 and shares at most one bond with each @xmath183 that forms @xmath182 . our lattice",
    "is then obtained as @xmath184 .",
    "typical examples are square and cubic lattices .    in the following , we shall prove that the model on @xmath78 with @xmath185 satisfies the connectivity condition , i.e. , any pair of indices @xmath186 and @xmath187 with common @xmath88 are connected . to see this ,",
    "let us consider the subspace with fixed @xmath88 . since we have assumed that @xmath185 , the fermion number @xmath188 satisfies @xmath189 .",
    "it is thus ensured that there is a flavor @xmath190 such that @xmath191 .",
    "the presence of two fermions with flavor @xmath190 plays an important role in the proof below . as in the previous examples",
    ", it suffices to show that @xmath192 and @xmath193 are connected for any bond @xmath139 since the lattice @xmath78 is obviously two - fold connected .    .",

    "fig : motion of the hole ] ) .",

    "this is confirmed by the first property ( i ) and the construction of @xmath78 .",
    "in fact , there is a sequence of @xmath195 such that @xmath196 and @xmath197 share a bond , and , by occupying these shared bonds , a pair of the hole and a fermion can move from @xmath175 to @xmath194 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : motion of the pair ] ) .",
    "let us prove the connectivity of @xmath192 and @xmath193 for an arbitrary bond @xmath139 by explicitly constructing a sequence @xmath198 such that @xmath199 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath200 and @xmath201 . from the construction of @xmath78 ,",

    "this means that we have @xmath203 such that @xmath204 where @xmath205 is a site in @xmath175 and @xmath206 is a certain flavor configuration .",
    "we recall that there is a flavor @xmath190 with @xmath207 . by using two fermions with flavor @xmath190",
    ", we will construct a process in which @xmath156 and @xmath99 are switched .",
    "now suppose that one of the fermions with flavor @xmath190 is in @xmath194 .",
    "we can find a sequence of shared bonds from @xmath175 to @xmath194 , as mentioned above .",

    "[ fig : gamma five ] , we have @xmath229 where @xmath230 is obtained from @xmath228 by switching two flavors @xmath15 and @xmath217 on a bond in @xmath175 . by introducing @xmath231 in the same manner as above",
    ", we find @xmath232 which gives a desired sequence @xmath233",
    "we have presented an extension of nagaoka s theorem to the infinite-@xmath1 hubbard model with su(@xmath0 ) symmetry . similar to the su(2 )",
    "case , for the model with one hole , we found that ( i ) the fully polarized ( nagaoka ) states analogous to the ferromagnetic states are ground states ; ( ii ) these nagaoka states are the only possible ground states if the connectivity condition is satisfied .",
    "however , unlike the su(2 ) case , here it is not easy to verify the connectivity condition for given @xmath0 and lattice structure . a simple sufficient condition for the connectivity condition is that the lattice contains at least one triangle loop .",
    "we also found a class of lattices consisting of loops of length four that satisfy the connectivity condition when the total number of sites @xmath11 is large enough ( @xmath234 ) .",
    "examples include hypercubic lattices in @xmath235 dimensions .",
    "an interesting question is whether the nagaoka states discussed in the present paper can be detected experimentally . for the su(2 )",
    "case , a controllable scheme to detect nagaoka ferromagnetism in optical superlattices has been proposed  @xcite . in this scheme , we need to prepare an array of isolated plaquettes each of which consists of four lattice sites with three fermions . the nagaoka transition and the variation of the total spin in the ground state can then be probed using a band mapping analysis  @xcite after switching off the superlattice potential .",
    "we now extend the above scheme to the su(@xmath0 ) case with @xmath236 . since positive hopping amplitudes are more difficult to achieve experimentally , we focus on the case where the lattice is bipartite and is formed by loops of length four ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : loop4 ] ) . in this case",
    ", one needs to prepare an array of clusters each of which consists of more than @xmath237 sites .",
    "a simple choice is to take each cluster as a cube with eight lattice sites , which implies that @xmath238 .",
    "fortunately , preparation of the su(6 ) hubbard system is feasible in current experiments with @xmath239yb atoms  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an array of cubes can be easily created by superimposing optical lattices with different periodicities .",
    "we thus expect that the onset of the nagaoka states in the su(@xmath0 ) hubbard model can be studied experimentally with currently - available techniques .",
    "finally , we remark on the instability of the nagaoka states . in the standard su(@xmath2 )",
    "case , one can prove that the nagaoka states are _ not _ the ground states for large enough densities of holes by constructing a variational state with one overturned spin which has a lower energy than the nagaoka states  @xcite . for the model on a square lattice , for example ,",
    "an extension of the earlier work yields the best estimate of the critical hole density @xmath240 , above which the nagaoka state is unstable  @xcite .",
    "the same variational argument applies to the su(@xmath0 ) case , because the model in the subspace with @xmath241 and @xmath242 is described by the su(2 ) hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "thus we see that the su(@xmath0 ) nagaoka states are also unstable with respect to the finite concentration of holes , implying the importance of the precise control of hole densities in a possible realization of the fully polarized states .",
