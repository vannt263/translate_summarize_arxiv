    ", this soft gluon can be regarded as collinear to the target nucleus which is moving on the backward light cone with the rapidity close to @xmath135 .",
    "therefore , it is quite natural to renormalize this soft gluon into the gluon distribution function of the target nucleus through the bk evolution equation .    after the subtraction of the rapidity divergence , both of the real and virtual contributions become regulated in terms of the @xmath129 integral which leads to the change of the splitting function into @xmath136 .",

    "the renormalization of the parton distributions of the proton and fragmentation functions follow the well - known dglap equation @xmath344and @xmath345 respectively . the rapidity divergence at one - loop order is factorized into the bk evolution in either fundamental representation or adjoint representation for the dipole gluon distribution of the nucleus .",
    "the hard coefficients are calculated up to one - loop order without taking the large @xmath68 limit for the quark @xmath38 channel .",
    "for some technical reasons , especially avoiding the sextupoles , as we have explained during the derivation , we take the large @xmath68 limit for other channels . in principle , using these hard coefficients together with the nlo parton distributions and fragmentation functions as well as the nlo small-@xmath1 evolution equation@xcite for dipole amplitudes , one can obtain the complete nlo cross section of the inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions in the large @xmath68 limit .",
    "the corrections to this nlo order cross section are either of order @xmath346 or suppressed by @xmath232 . as to the running coupling effects  @xcite in our hybrid factorization formalism , we have no @xmath347 dependence at the leading order ( @xmath347 has been absorbed into the definition of the saturation momentum ) , and one power of @xmath347 at the nlo , thus we find that the one - loop approximation for the running coupling should be sufficient .",
    "we have shown that the differential cross section for inclusive hadron productions in @xmath0 collisions can be written in a factorization form in the coordinate space .",
    "the factorization scale dependence in the hard coefficients reflects the dglap evolutions for the quark distributions and fragmentation functions .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar coordinate dependence ( associated with @xmath348 ) has also been found in the transverse momentum resummation formalism derived for the drell - yan lepton pair production in ref .  @xcite . on the other hand , the hard coefficients in our case do not contain double logarithms , therefore there is no need for the sudakov resummation for forward inclusive hadron production in @xmath0 collisions .",

    "in other words , the above expression should be understood as if the parton distributions and fragmentation functions are written inside those coordinate integrals .",
    "in addition , we have also demonstrated that all the hard factors can be calculated easily in the well - known mv and gbw model and shown that our results agree with the collinear factorization results in the dilute limit .    in the above calculations , we focus on the hadron production in the forward @xmath0 collisions , where we can safely neglect the transverse momentum effects from the incoming parton distributions of the nucleon .",
    "the explicit calculations at one - loop order in the above also support this factorization , i.e. , the collinear divergence associated with the incoming parton distribution from the nucleon does not contain the transverse momentum dependence . the situation may change if we have both small-@xmath1 effects from nucleon and nucleus , such as in the mid - rapidity in @xmath0 collisions at the lhc , when the transverse momentum effects from the gluon distribution of nucleon become important .",
    "it is in this region that a naive @xmath34-factorization has been derived  @xcite and has been widely used in the literature",
