    "the nonequilibrium work theorem , or jarzynski equation , relates nonequilibrium work performed on a dissipative system during certain time interval to the difference of the corresponding equilibrium free energies .",
    "formulated first for classical systems @xcite , the work theorem has been generalized to the quantum case , too @xcite .",
    "monnai and tasaki have found quantum ( @xmath1 ) corrections to the transient and steady - state fluctuation theorems for a damped harmonic oscillator @xcite .",
    "chernyak and mukamel gave quantum ( @xmath1 ) corrections to the work theorem for a specific form of the driven system hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "the quantum generalizations of the work theorem have triggered a certain controversy in the literature on whether it is possible to uniquely define the quantum work operator and how to interpret the quantum work theorem @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we use the ideas inspired by the classical work theorems to derive several relations which allow us the calculation of equilibrium semiclassical free energy changes along non - equilibrium classical trajectories .",
    "our aim is twofold .",
    "first , we develop a practical tool for the calculation of semiclassical free energies differences through classical equations of motion and/or molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "such semiclassical corrections are responsible , e.g. , for the short - distance anomaly of the pair distribution function of liquid neon @xcite .",
    "second , we wish to get a better understanding of how quantum interference influences the nonequilibrium work and if it is possible to uniquely define the semiclassical work operator .    note that all the semiclassical quantities which are considered in the present paper are evaluated in the leading order in @xmath0 , i.e. , with the accuracy @xmath2 .",
    "we use the simbols @xmath3 and @xmath4 intermittently throughout the text , in order to avoid writing numerous factors of @xmath5 .",
    "let us consider a collection of @xmath6 quantum point particles with the hamiltonian    @xmath7    @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the positions , momenta , and masses of the particles , @xmath11 is the potential energy .",
    "hereafter , the boldface notation @xmath12 @xmath13 is used to collectively denote the set of all @xmath14 and @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the particles are prepared in an equilibrium canonical ensemble at the temperature @xmath15 the corresponding distribution ( density matrix ) reads @xmath16 @xmath17 being the partition function .",
    "we wish to calculate the leading ( @xmath18 ) corrections to the canonical distribution ( [ ro ] ) and partition function @xmath17 . to this end",
    ", it is convenient to switch to the wigner representation @xcite , so that ( [ ro ] ) becomes the corresponding wigner distribution ( the subscript @xmath19 ) @xmath20 @xmath21 here @xmath22 and @xmath23 can be treated as the phase variables in the wigner space , taking the trace reduces to the integration over the wigner phase space variables , @xmath24 is the classical hamiltonian corresponding to its quantum counterpart ( [ h ] ) , and @xmath25 is the temperature - dependent quantum correction @xcite @xmath26 for our further purposes we preaverage @xmath25 over momenta .",
    "that is , we replace @xmath27 by @xmath28 and obtain @xmath29 we also introduce two new functions @xmath30 @xmath31 the physical meaning of these new functions will be explained below .",
    "let us now consider the quantities @xmath32 here @xmath33 is the semiclassical wigner distribution ( [ rwgen ] ) but @xmath34 for @xmath35 are not true semiclassical wigner distributions @xcite .",
    "however , all @xmath34 share the following evident property : the partition functions@xmath36 coincide with the true semiclassical partition function @xmath37 within the accuracy @xmath38 .",
    "the equivalence of @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 can be demonstrated via integration by parts,@xmath42",
    "we are in a position now to derive the semiclassical version of the nonequilibrium work theorem .",
    "let @xmath43 be a quantum hamiltonian , which is allowed to be explicitly time - dependent .",
    "let us now introduce the quantities @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the classical hamiltonian which corresponds to the quantum hamiltonian ( [ ht ] ) , and functions @xmath46 are constructed out of @xmath45 as is prescribed via eqs .",
    "( [ w0])-([w3 ] ) .",
    "let us now consider @xmath47 for @xmath35 as _ classical _ hamiltonians which are parametrically temperature - dependent @xcite .",
    "they can equivalently be rewritten as @xmath48 so , the quantum correction gives rise to a simple redefinition of the potential energy , which acquires an additional temperature - dependent @xmath18 contribution .",
    "now we can use the hamiltonian ( [ hia ] ) to write down the corresponding classical equations of motion @xmath49 which produce the classical trajectories @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , we can treat @xmath51 as the corresponding classical canonical distribution with the partition function@xmath52 after this is done , we can proceed analogously to the derivation of the classical jarzynski equation @xcite .",
    "namely , we can write the following chain of identities:@xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath35 . in deriving eq .",
    "( [ ab1 ] ) we make use of the fact that motion of a hamiltonian system can be regarded as the canonical transformation , for which the liouville theorem holds : @xmath55 @xmath56 . introducing the abbreviation @xmath57 and dividing eq .",
    "( [ ab1 ] ) by @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59    we can further split the total hamiltonian into the system hamiltonian , the bath hamiltonian and their coupling , @xmath60 here the system hamiltonian only is allowed to be explicitly time - dependent .",
    "plugging @xmath47 ( [ sb ] ) into the identity ( [ ab2 ] ) and making use of the equations of motion ( [ em ] ) , we can write@xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 being the work performed on our _ classical _ system . thus eqs .",
    "( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja1 ] ) yield @xmath64 which is the semiclassical analogue of the classical jarzynski formula @xcite .",
    "note that the ratio of the total ( @xmath65 ) partition functions @xmath66 equals to the ratio of the system partition functions @xcite .",
    "indeed , the reduced system ( @xmath67 ) density matrix @xmath68 is defined via averaging the total density matrix ( [ wt ] ) over the bath degrees of freedom @xcite : @xmath69 where the bath free energy @xmath70 is determined through the bath partition function@xmath71 the system partition function in eq .",
    "( [ wts ] ) is explicitly defined as @xmath72 and we can write @xmath73 if the quantum @xmath18 corrections are neglected , then eqs .",
    "( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja0 ] ) reduce , of course , to the classical work theorem for hamiltonian systems @xcite .    to illustrate computational aspects of practical use of relations ( [ ab2],[ja0 ] ) , we performed `` molecular dynamics '' simulations for a point particle in one - dimensional nonlinear potential .",
    "the quantum hamiltonian reads @xmath74 in this example , the mass @xmath75 , the parameters @xmath76 , the position @xmath77 , the momentum @xmath78 , the time @xmath79 , and the planck constant are taken as dimensionless .",
    "we construct the corresponding semiclassical hamiltonian @xmath80 as is explained in sections ii and iii .",
    "then we calculate the free energy difference at times @xmath79 and @xmath81 , @xmath82 , by `` molecular dynamics '' simulations and `` exactly '' . in `` molecular dynamics '' simulations , we sample initial values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 according to the wigner distribution ( [ wt ] ) ( @xmath85 being the number of samplings ) , solve equations of motions ( [ em ] ) numerically , and calculate the quantity @xmath86 .",
    "the procedure is repeated @xmath85 times , the averaged value @xmath87 is obtained , and @xmath88 is finally calculated through the semiclassical work theorem ( [ ab2 ] ) .",
    "`` exact '' @xmath88 is obtained trough the direct numerical evaluation of the semiclassial partition functions @xmath89 and @xmath58 according to eq .",
    "( [ zt ] ) .",
    "the results of the calculations are depicted in figure 1 .",
    "we see that making @xmath90 samplings gives already reasonable , but quite noisy estimation for @xmath88 ( dashed lines ) , @xmath91 gets a better result ( dotted lines ) .",
    "@xmath92 yields @xmath88 which is virtually indistinguishable with the exact results ( full lines ) .",
    "the convergence is thus rather slow ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the comparison of different simulation schemes for obtaining free energy differences ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the convergence speed is the same for classical ( bottom curves , @xmath93 ) and semiclassical ( upper curves , @xmath94 ) case @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath95 , @xmath96 , has already been used in molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "such a choice gives a correct semiclassical distribution , but its practical implementation may encounter certain difficulties @xcite .",
    "the choice @xmath97 gives a correct semiclassical distribution over positions @xmath23 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian @xmath98 has also found its application in molecular dynamics simulations , being evaluated up to the terms of the order of @xmath99 @xcite and @xmath100 @xcite . to our knowledge , the hamiltonians @xmath101 and",
    "@xmath102 have never been used in practice .",
    "however , they give more tractable expressions for the semiclassical potential @xmath103 . it should be noted that ( almost ) all physically relevant potentials @xmath104 when @xmath105 . in that case",
    ", there is no problem with the exponentiating the semiclassical correction potentials , e.g. , @xmath106 such exponentiation may work even beyond its strict domain of validity @xmath107 , since it corresponds to the partial summation of the higher order contributions in the semiclassical expansion .",
    "if we use strongly attractive potentials , then exponentiation in eq .",
    "( [ hex ] ) for @xmath97 may not be feasible , since the contribution due to the second term in eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) may become predominant , so that the exponential explodes .",
    "in such a case , the choices @xmath108 and @xmath109 are necessary . finally , a word of caution concerning applications of the present ( and similar ) semiclassical methods to realistic molecular systems .",
    "the ubiquitous presence of sharply varying repulsions in condensed phases means that the terms like ( [ w2 ] ) and ( [ w3 ] ) can be quite large .",
    "this can lead to numerical difficulties @xcite .",
    "more fundamentally , this could indicate that a straightforward @xmath0-perturbative treatment might not always be appropriate .",
    "several important points are to be discussed here in connection with the interpretation of our results as semiclassical work theorems . as has been stressed in sec .",
    "ii , the distributions @xmath110 ( [ rwi ] ) for @xmath35 are not true semiclassical wigner distributions .",
    "however , they give correct values of the semiclassical partition functions within the accuracy @xmath38 .",
    "furthermore , the hamiltonian dynamics governed by eqs .",
    "( [ em ] ) is not , of course , the true semiclassical dynamics .",
    "however , if we run classical molecular dynamics simulations with the hamiltonians @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) we get correct semiclassical values of the partition functions , again with the accuracy @xmath38 .    the explicit form of the semiclassical nonequilibrium `` work theorem '' ( eqs .",
    "( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja0 ] ) ) is not unique .",
    "we have simultaneously derived four ( @xmath113 ) different `` work theorems '' with different definitions of the work operator @xmath63 ( [ ja1 ] ) . for each particular choice of the classical hamiltonian , @xmath63",
    "can definitely be treated as the classical work , and all @xmath63 coincide in the limit @xmath114 .",
    "however , we can not regard any of @xmath63 as a true semiclassical work operator .",
    "first , @xmath63 for @xmath113 yield different values of work , and it is not clear which choice ( if any ) is preferable .",
    "second , the mean value of the work operator @xmath115 does not coincide with the mean semiclassical energy difference @xmath116 .",
    "indeed , adopting the notation @xmath117 we can explicitly define @xmath118 and @xmath119 therefore , @xmath120 the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath116 is of the order of @xmath121 and is generally nonzero @xcite .",
    "this is the semiclassical way of stating that it is hardly possible to properly and unambiguously define the quantum work operator @xcite .",
    "it is important that @xmath63 ( [ ja1 ] ) is explicitly temperature dependent .",
    "that is a direct consequence of quantum interference . in classical case",
    ", we can consider a single trajectory in the phase space and calculate the work along it .",
    "such a work is determined exclusively by the difference of energies along the trajectory .",
    "incoherent summation over many such trajectories , weighted via classical canonical distribution , yields the classical work theorem . in quantum or even semiclassical case",
    ", there exists interference between the trajectories , which manifests itself through the temperature dependent hamiltonians @xmath111 .",
    "thus , even in the semiclassical limit , it is not possible to define @xmath63 as a function of exclusively the phase space variables and time .",
    "the ensemble quantity , viz .",
    ", the temperature , inevitably enters the definition of work .",
    "the semiclassical jarzynski equations ( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja0 ] ) can not be directly considered as semiclassical versions of the quantum jarzynski equation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the latter is written as @xcite@xmath122 here @xmath123 is the total hamiltonian in the heisenberg representation , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 is the chronological ordering operator .",
    "the trajectory - dependent work operator is explicitly defined as @xcite @xmath126 ( the last expression in eq .",
    "( [ wq ] ) holds true provided we partition the total hamiltonian as a sum of the system hamiltonian , bath hamiltonian and their coupling , and assume that the system hamiltonian is explicitly time dependent , @xmath127 ) . in principle , we can write down a direct semiclassical analogue of eq .",
    "( [ yaqq ] ) .",
    "the corresponding formulas are not presented here , since they are quite cumbersome and difficult to interpret .",
    "what is even more important , we have to introduce the semiclassical time - evolution operator , which should be evaluated in the leading order in @xmath121 . that would prevent us from a simple classical interpretation of the formulas .",
    "we have derived semiclassical analogues ( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja0 ] ) of the classical work theorems , which allow us to evaluate the ratio of the ( system ) partition functions in the leading order in @xmath0 , with the accuracy @xmath2 .",
    "the corrections due to the quantum statistics ( bose - einstein or fermi - dirac ) give rise to the contributions @xmath128 to the equilibrium density matrices and partition functions @xcite and are not considered here .",
    "the semiclassical analogues of the work theorems are formulated in terms of purely classical hamiltonians @xmath129 ( [ hi ] ) and classical trajectories , so that semiclassical partition functions can be evaluated , e.g. , via classical molecular dynamics simulations .",
    "the hamiltonians , however , contain additional potential - energy terms , which are proportional to @xmath0 and are temperature - dependent .",
    "the hamiltonians @xmath95 and @xmath98 have already been used in classical , the so - called wigner - kirkwood , molecular dynamics simulations ( see refs . @xcite and @xcite , correspondingly ) . conceptually similar",
    "are also the feynman - hibbs molecular dynamics @xcite and the quantized hamilton dynamics @xcite .",
    "we mention also that the use of the path integral technique in dynamical computer simulations necessitates introducing additional fictitious classical degrees of freedom into the system under study .",
    "for example , the ring polymer molecular dynamics is based on the classical evolution of the polymer beads @xcite .",
    "the path integrals have recently been applied to the calculation of partition functions through the quantum work theorem @xcite . in our semiclassical method ,",
    "no additional degrees of freedom are introduced .",
    "furthermore , the higher order in @xmath0 contributions can straightforwardly be incorporated into our main formulas ( [ ab2 ] ) and ( [ ja0 ] ) , if necessary .",

    "note finally that the present approach can be incorporated into a general scheme developed in @xcite to generate semiclassical versions of different fluctuation theorems for hamiltonian systems in the equilibrium and in a steady state .",
    "for example , treating the hamiltonians ( [ sb ] ) as true classical hamiltonians , we can straightforwardly derive the semiclassical counterpart of the crooks transient fluctuation theorem @xcite : @xmath130 here @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the classical work ( [ ja1 ] ) expressed as the function of the initial and final coordinates , correspondingly .",
