    "over the past few decades , the theory and numerical simulation of the coupled electro - mechanical problem have been interesting subjects of research , cf .",
    "pao @xcite and eringen and maugin @xcite .",
    "however , with the invention of the so - called electro - active polymers ( eaps ) capable of exhibiting large deformations in response to the application of electric fields , several new challenges appear and need to be addressed .",
    "open problems remain both in the understanding of electro - mechanical coupling in soft matter and in simulating the behavior of electro - sensitive bodies under the influence of an electric field .",
    "eaps can be used as alternatives to materials traditionally used to develop actuators like piezoelectric ceramics , shape memory metals and electro - rheological fluids , cf .",
    "ohalloran et al .",
    "potential applications of eaps in developing artificial muscles and robotic systems include robot manipulators @xcite , soft pumps @xcite , loud - speakers @xcite , portable force feed - back devices @xcite , haptic interfaces @xcite , electric generators for energy harvesting @xcite@xcite , transport vehicles @xcite , @xcite , and sensing equipment @xcite@xcite , among others .",
    "efforts were made in the past to model and simulate the behaviour of eaps using the theory of nonlinear elasticity and nonlinear visco - elasticity , for example , by kofod @xcite , sommer - larsen et al .",
    "@xcite , goulbourne et al .",
    "@xcite , yang et al .",
    "@xcite , and rosset et al .",
    "however , the papers mentioned above assume that the material electric properties are independent of deformation .",
    "note that because large strain occurs during the deformation process , the nonlinearity of the material electric properties must be accounted for . in order to overcome this shortcoming , some related boundary - value problems involving finite deformation",
    "were analyzed by taking into account the nonlinearity of the electric polarisation , for example , in the works of voltairas et al .",
    "@xcite , dorfmann and ogden @xcite , mller et al .",
    "@xcite , zwecker et al .",
    "@xcite , and vertechy et al .",
    "the effect of viscosity in the modeling of eaps was examined recently by ask et al .",
    "@xcite and bschel et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a basic assumption in the modelling of eaps in the papers mentioned above has been an instantaneous or ` elastic ' response of the material to an applied electric field .",
    "this , however , may not be the case in all the electroactive polymers and we aim at modelling this phenomena in this research .",
    "we work under a more general case where it is assumed that on the application of an electric field , the overall macroscopic polarisation of the material is time - dependent .",
    "thus , in addition to the mechanical viscoelasticity of the polymeric matrix , an additional energy - dissipating mechanism is considered on account of the evolution of the electric polarisation with time .    among the several approaches towards a phenomenological theory of mechanical viscoelasticity ,",
    "the literature is usually divided on account of the nature of internal variable used to quantify dissipation .",
    "the internal variable can be assumed to be of stress - type , as proposed by simo @xcite and lion @xcite , or it can be strain - type , as used by lubliner @xcite , reese and govindjee @xcite and huber and tsakmakis @xcite . in the latter approach , which has been also followed in this paper , the deformation gradient is decomposed into elastic and inelastic parts ( @xmath1 ) where the inelastic part is determined from a differential type flow rule .",
    "in addition to the mechanical viscoelastic dissipation , we also model electric dissipation by considering a similar decomposition of our independent variable ( electric field in this case ) into ` elastic ' and ` viscous ' parts as @xmath0 .",
    "this follows a similar approach by saxena et al .",
    "@xcite for the magnetic counterpart of this problem .",
    "the energy and momentum balance laws of electroelasticity are derived from the fundamental equations of electrostatics following the work of mcmeeking and landis @xcite .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "the theory of rate - dependent electroelastic deformations is presented in section 2 . starting with the basic principles of electrostatics and continuum mechanics ( as detailed in the appendix ) ,",
    "we obtain the energy and momentum balance laws in the case of electroelasticity . the deformation gradient and the electric field",
    "are decomposed into equilibrium and non - equilibrium parts ( @xmath2 ) . using the laws of thermodynamics and a form of the free energy density function ,",
    "constitutive equations are derived along with the conditions to be satisfied by the evolution equations of the non - equilibrium quantities .    for the purpose of obtaining numerical solutions later , the energy density function and the evolution equations for the non - equilbrium quantities are specialised to specific forms .",
    "several electro - visco - elastic coupling parameters are introduced in this step and we define thermodynamically consistent and physically reasonable evolution laws for the internal variables . in section 3 ,",
    "numerical solutions are obtained corresponding to five different types of ( mechanical and electric ) loading conditions .",
    "the effects of the underlying deformation , strain rate , electric field , and electric field rate are studied on the evolution of the resulting stress and the dielectric displacement .",
    "the results , presented graphically , show a strong coupling between strain and electric field , as well as the strong dependence of the response on electro - viscoelastic coupling parameters thus making the model amenable to fitting with experimental data , as an when it becomes available in future .",
    "we consider an electroelastic material that , when undeformed , unstressed and in the absence of electric fields , occupies the material configuration @xmath3 with boundary @xmath4 .",
    "it is then subjected to a static deformation due to the combined action of an electric field , mechanical surface tractions and body forces . the spatial configuration at time @xmath5 is denoted by @xmath6 with a boundary @xmath7 .",
    "the two configurations are related by a deformation function @xmath8 which maps every point @xmath9 to a point @xmath10 .",
    "the deformation gradient is defined as @xmath11 , where grad is the gradient operator with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "its determinant is given by @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 be the electric charge density per unit volume in @xmath6 , @xmath15 be the spatial electric field vector , @xmath16 be the spatial electric displacement vector , and @xmath17 be the spatial polarisation vector .",
    "the balance equations for the electric quantities are given by a simplified form of the two maxwell s equations as @xmath18 where the electric vectors are related by the constitutive law @xmath19 and curl and div denote the corresponding differentiation with respect to the position vectors @xmath20 in the spatial configuration @xmath6 .",
    "we note that the above equations can also be written in the material configuration @xmath3 by employing the following transformations @xmath21 thus giving @xmath22 such that curl and div denote the corresponding differentiation operators with respect to the position vectors @xmath12 in @xmath3 and @xmath23 is the right cauchy",
    " green deformation tensor .",
    "since curl of a gradient vanishes , the electric field vector can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential from equation @xmath24 as @xmath25    at an interface or a boundary , the electric vectors must satisfy the conditions @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the surface charge density , @xmath28 is the unit outward normal to the surface and @xmath29 represents the difference @xmath30 .      the balance of linear momentum in the configuration @xmath6 is given in terms of the total cauchy stress tensor as @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the total cauchy stress tensor that takes both mechanical and electric effects into account , @xmath33 is the purely mechanical body force , @xmath34 is the mass density , @xmath35 is the acceleration , and the divergence operator is taken to operate on the first index of a second order tensor . we refer to appendix a for a detailed derivation of the balance equations in the context of electroelasticity .",
    "the above equation can be written in referential form using the total piola ",
    "kirchhoff stress @xmath36 as @xmath37 with @xmath38 being the referential mass density and @xmath39 being the referential body force .",
    "note that the tensor @xmath40 is sometimes also referred to as the ` second ' piola  kirchhoff stress .",
    "the principle of balance of angular momentum renders the cauchy and the piola  kirchhoff stress tensors symmetric @xmath41    the corresponding boundary conditions are given by the equations and .",
    "very often , the eaps are synthesized from a rubber like polymer .",
    "the polymeric rubber matrix is viscoelastic in nature which leads to energy dissipation on a mechanical deformation .",
    "in addition to this , energy dissipation can also occur due to a time - dependent polarisation of the material on application of an electric field .",
    "we consider the possibility that on a sudden application of an electric field ( or a potential difference ) , the electric displacement @xmath42 , the polarisation @xmath43 , and the resulting electric contribution to stress generated in the material evolve with time to reach an equilibrium value . thus , the two effects need to be modelled appropriately .    to take into account mechanical viscous effects",
    ", we assume the existence of an intermediate configuration @xmath44 that is , in general , incompatible .",
    "the tangent spaces of @xmath3 and @xmath44 are related by a second order tensor @xmath45 that quantifies viscous motion while the tangent spaces of @xmath44 and @xmath6 are related by a second order tensor @xmath46 that quantifies elastic distortion .",
    "the configuration @xmath44 is in parallel to the energy - conserving electroelastic deformation from @xmath3 to @xmath6 .",
    "this motivates the decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a viscous part ( cf .",

    "green strain tensors as @xmath23 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "corresponding quantities are defined for the viscous parts as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .    in order to model the electric dissipation effects",
    ", we consider an additive decomposition of the electric field vector into an ` elastic ' and a ` viscous ' part @xmath51 which defines a dissipation mechanism in parallel to an energy - conserving mechanism that gives the instantaneous response .",
    "the above additive decomposition of the electric field is motivated by a similar decoupling of the deformation gradient into elastic and viscous parts in the viscoelasticity theory .",
    "a similar approach has been taken by saxena et al .",
    "@xcite to model magneto - viscoelastic effects wherein an additive decomposition of the magnetic induction as @xmath52 has been performed .",
    "the behaviour of the internal variables defined above is assumed such that if a constant electric field is applied at time @xmath53 , then at that instant @xmath54 and @xmath55 . as time progresses , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
