    "one of the roles expected for the @xmath0-mode instability to play ( andersson 1998 , friedman & morsink 1998 ) is deceleration of the spin of newly born hot neutron stars by emitting gravitational waves that carry away the angular momentum of the star ( e.g. , lindblom et al 1998 ) . we know , however , that among older and colder neutron stars as found in lmxb systems there are many rapidly rotating neutron stars like a millisecond pulsar ( see , e.g , phinney & kulkarni 1994 ) .",
    "this fact suggests the possibility that the @xmath0-mode instability does not always work well to spin down the rapid rotation of the stars . for the @xmath0-modes in cold neutron stars with a solid crust ,",
    "for example , bildsten & ushomirsky ( 2000 ) suggested a damping mechanism operating in the viscous boundary layer at the interface between the solid crust and the fluid core , to explain the clustering of spin frequencies around the value of 300hz for accreting neutron stars in lmxb systems ( van der klis 2000 ; see also andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1999 ) .",
    "for the modal properties of the @xmath0-modes in neutron stars with a solid crust , see yoshida & lee ( 2001 ) , who showed that the @xmath0-modes in the core are largely affected by resonance with the toroidal sound modes propagating in the solid crust .",
    "as neutron stars cool down below @xmath15 , neutrons and protons in the core are believed to be in superfluid states ( e.g. , shapiro & tuekolwsky 1983 ) . in a rotating system of superfluids , it is well known that scattering between vortices in the superfluids and normal fluid particles produces dissipation called mutual friction ( e.g. , khalatnikov 1965 , tilley & tilley 1990 ) .",
    "therefore , for people who are interested in the @xmath0-modes instability , it was a serious concern whether the @xmath0-mode instability could survive the dissipation due to mutual friction in the superfluid core of cold neutron stars , e.g. , in lmxbs .",
    "it was lindblom & mendell ( 2000 ) who first examined the damping effects of mutual friction in the core on the @xmath0-mode instability , and concluded that the mutual friction could not be strong enough to damp out the instability in most of the parameter domains which we are interested in .",
    "in their analysis of the @xmath0-modes in neutron stars , lindblom & mendell ( 2000 ) employed a perturbative method in which the spin angular frequency @xmath6 is regarded as the infinitesimal parameter to expand the eigenfrequencies and eigenfunctions of the modes , and they looked for the @xmath0-modes with the scalings given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the chemical potentials of the proton , neutron , and electron in the core , and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the velocities of the proton and neutron superfluids , and the prime @xmath23 indicates the euler perturbation of the quantity .",
    "recently , andersson & comer ( 2001 ) discussed the dynamics of superfluid neutron star cores , and confirmed an earlier result by lee ( 1995 ) that there are no @xmath24-modes propagating in the superfluid core .",
    "they also applied their argument to the @xmath0-modes in the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids , and suggested the existence of two distinct families of the @xmath0-modes in the core , i.e. , @xmath0-modes for which the neutrons and the protons flow together , and those for which the neutrons and the protons are counter moving .",
    "lindblom & mendell ( 2000 ) considered the former family of the @xmath0-modes , which are less strongly affected by the mutual friction than the latter .    in this paper , we employ a different method of calculation to investigate the @xmath0-modes in rotating neutron stars , although the basic equations describing the dynamics of superfluids in the core are essentially the same as those given in lindblom & mendell ( 1994 ) .",
    "our method of solution is a variant of that used in lee & saio ( 1986 ) . because the separation of variables is not possible for perturbations in rotating stars ,",
    "we expand the perturbations in terms of spherical harmonic functions @xmath25 with different @xmath26 s for a given @xmath9 .",
    "we substitute the expansions into linearized basic equations to obtain a set of simultaneous linear ordinary differential equations of the expansion coefficients , which is to be solved as an eigenvalue problem of the oscillation frequency . in this method",
    ", we do not have to assume apriori a form of solutions for the @xmath0-modes in the lowest order of @xmath6 . in ",
    "2 we present the basic equations employed in this paper for the dynamics of superfluids in the core , and in  3 dissipation processes considered in this paper are described .",
    "4 gives numerical results , and  5 and  6 are for discussions and conclusions .",
    "microscopically , the superfluids in a rotating system move irrotationally everywhere except within the core of vortex lines . averaging over many vortices in the fluids , we may define the average superfluid velocities @xmath27 , which can satisfy the usual relation for uniform rotation @xmath28 in the equilibrium state ( see , e.g. , feynman 1972 ) . in the following we simply use @xmath29 , instead of @xmath27 , to signify the superfluid velocities .",
    "hydrodynamic equations for a rotating superfluid based on the two - fluid model with the normal fluid and superfluid components are derived , for example , in khalatnikov ( 1965 ) .",
    "we derive basic equations governing superfluid motions in the neutron star core in the newtonian dynamics , assuming uniform rotation of the star .",
    "the core is assumed to be filled with neutron and proton superfluids and a normal fluid of electron .",
    "we also assume perfect charge neutrality between the protons and electrons because the plasma frequency is much higher than the oscillation frequencies considered in this paper ( see , e.g. , mendell 1991a ) .",
    "since the transition temperatures @xmath30k to neutron and proton superfluids are much higher than the interior temperatures of old neutron stars ( see , e.g. , epstein 1988 ) , we assume that all the neutrons and protons in the core are in superfluid states and the normal fluid components of the fluids can be ignored .",
    "the basic hydrodynamic equations employed in this paper for the neutron and proton superfluids in rotating neutron stars are essentially the same as those given in mendell ( 1991a ) and lindblom & mendell ( 1994 ) . in a fluid system",
    "in which two superfluids coexist , the entrainment between the two superfluid motions occurs because a cooper pair of one fluid particles is affected by the force field produced by the other fluid particles ( andreev & bashkin 1975 for a system of @xmath31he and @xmath32he superfluids ) . in the system of the neutron and proton superfluids in the core",

    "if we assume perfect charge neutrality of the proton and electron plasma , we may have @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the proton and the electron masses .",

    "note that we have neglected the entropy carried by the normal fluid of electron for simplicity .",
    "the poisson equation is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 is the gravitational constant .",
    "to linearise the hydrodynamic equations for the superfluids in rotating neutron stars , we assume that the neutron and proton superfluids and the electron normal fluid in an equilibrium state are in the same rotational motion with the angular velocity @xmath6 around the axis of rotation , which is along the z - axis . in a perturbed state , however , the neutron and the proton superfluids move differently from each other in the core , obeying their own governing equations .",
    "the mass current vectors are linearized to be @xmath61 where the prime @xmath23 indicates the eulerian perturbation of the quantity , and @xmath62 is the fluid velocity in the equilibrium state , and @xmath63 are the perturbed mass current vectors in a corotating frame .",

    "on the other hand , the growth timescales @xmath174 and @xmath173 for the @xmath2-modes are much longer than those of the @xmath1-modes , and the instability caused by the @xmath2-modes is much weaker than the instability by the @xmath1-modes .",

    "in this paper we have discussed the modal properties of the @xmath0-modes of neutron stars with the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids .",
    "we numerically find that the @xmath0-modes of rotating neutron stars with the superfluid core are split into ordinary @xmath1-modes and superfluid @xmath2-modes , and that the two superfluids in the core flow together for the @xmath1-modes and they counter move for the @xmath2-modes .",

    "the @xmath1-modes have the scaling of @xmath211 and are the same @xmath0-modes discussed by lindblom & mendell ( 2000 ) , while the @xmath2-modes have the scaling of @xmath212 . the instability caused by the @xmath2-modes",
    "is found much weaker than the instability by the @xmath1-mode and will be easily stabilized by various dissipation processes in the star .",
    "we have confirmed that , except in a few narrow regions of @xmath5 around the prominent local minimums of @xmath176 , the dissipation due to mutual friction in the superfluid core is ineffective to stabilize the instability by the @xmath1-modes , as first shown by lindblom & mendell ( 2000 ) .",
    "we have shown that these prominent local minimums of @xmath245 are caused by mode crossings between the @xmath1-mode and the superfluid inertial @xmath220-modes with long radial wavelengths comparable to those of the @xmath1-mode ( see also andersson & comer 2001 ) . since",
    "mutual friction is almost always very strong for the @xmath2-modes and the instability by the @xmath2-modes itself is quite weak , only the instability by the @xmath1-modes will be of direct observational importance , e.g. , as mechanisms that generate gravitational waves from normal modes of rotating neutron stars and/or cause the clustering of spin frequencies around 300hz for neutron stars in lmxb s , unless there exist other strong damping mechanisms for the @xmath0-modes ( see jones 2001a , b ; lindblom & owen 2002 ; haensel , levenfish & yakovlev 2002 ) .    in this paper , we have made a brief report on a numerical result of inertial modes in the superfluid core .",
    "we find that inertial modes in superfluid neutron stars are also split into ordinary inertial @xmath219-modes and superfluid inertial @xmath220-modes .",
    "it is generally observed for inertial modes with long radial wavelengths that the two superfluids co - move in the core for the @xmath219-modes , and they counter - move for the @xmath220-modes ( see yoshida & lee 2002b for more complete discussions on inertial modes in the superfluid core ) .",
    "inertial modes are expected to work as a mechanism limiting the amplitude growth of the @xmath0-modes ( morsink 2002 ) .",
    "there are many interesting and challenging problems we have to deal with before we can conclude definitely about the neutron star oscillations . confronting their cooling calculations of neutron stars with observational data for the surface temperature of several neutron stars , kaminker , haensel , & yakovlev ( 2001 ) , and kaminker ,",
    "yakovlev , & gnedin ( 2002 ) suggested that neutron superfluidity in the core of middle - aged neutron stars should be weak in the sense that the critical temperature @xmath318 is less than @xmath319k .",
    "if this is the case , there exist no neutron superfluids in the core of temperatures @xmath320k .",
    "if neutrons in the core are in normal state , modal properties of low frequency oscillations propagating in the core will be different from those for the core filled with neutron and proton superfluids , since buoyant force in the core , produced by thermal and/or chemical stratification ( reisenegger & goldreich 1992 ) , comes into play .",
    "the normal neutron fluid core with stratification will support @xmath24-mode propagation , and the buoyant force in it will affect inertial modes in slowly rotating neutron stars .",
    "the nodeless @xmath0-modes of @xmath187 , however , will remain almost the same even in the presence of buoyant force ( see yoshida & lee 2000b ) , and damping due to mutual friction in the core will remain weak for the @xmath1-modes , for which neutron and proton fluids co - move . let us point out a possibility of using neutron star binaries as a probe to investigate existence or non - existence of neutron superfludity in the core , since tidally excited low frequency modes will be @xmath24-modes in the normal fluid core but inertial modes in the superfluid core , and the different tidal responses will result in different binary evolutions .",
    "the presence of a solid crust and a magnetic field in neutron star interior is another factor that makes complicated the problems of global oscillations of the stars .",
    "the solid crust is not a rigid body and supports its own normal modes ( see , e.g. , mcdermott et al 1988 , lee & strohmayer 1996 ) .",
    "for example , there exist torsional modes propagating in the crust , which can be resonantly coupled with the @xmath0-modes in the normal fluid core ( yoshida & lee 2001 ; levin & ushomirsky 2001 ) . quite recently , using a local analysis of perturbations , kinney & mendell ( 2002 ) have suggested that no @xmath0-mode solution to the magnetohydrodynamic equations ( e.g. , mendell 1998 ) exists in the superfluid core when both the neutron and proton vortices are pinned to the solid crust .",
    "this may suggest that a careful formulation of boundary conditions at the core - crust interfaces will be necessary to obtain reliable solutions to global oscillations of neutron stars , particularly when a magnetic field is essential for the oscillations .",
    "for the oscillation equations in the superfluid core , we employ vectors @xmath321 , @xmath322 , @xmath323 , @xmath324 , @xmath325 , and @xmath326 , whose components are given by @xmath327 where @xmath115 for even modes and @xmath117 for odd modes , and @xmath328 .",
