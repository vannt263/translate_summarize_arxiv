    "the phenomenological motivations for considering extensions of the standard model ( sm ) which are based on grand unified theories ( guts ; see , for instance , @xcite , or @xcite and references therein ) are two - fold :    * first , the embedding of the sm gauge group @xmath1 into simple or semi - simple gauge groups like @xmath2 , @xmath0 , or @xmath3 , to name a few popular examples , allows for a reduction of independent gauge coupling constants .",
    "indeed , from the renormalization - group ( rg ) running of the measured sm couplings , there is evidence that a unification around scales of @xmath4 is possible @xcite , although for this idea to work quantitatively , additional degrees of freedom at high energies should contribute to the rg running . a well - known example which could exhibit the unification of coupling constants is , of course , the minimally super - symmetric sm ( mssm ) . *",
    "second , the embedding of the sm fermions into _ a few _ ( smaller ) gut representations appears attractive , both , for minimalistic reasons as well as for a possible reduction of independent mass and mixing parameters in the flavour sector . except for the similar masses of the @xmath5-lepton and the @xmath6-quark ,",
    "there is , however , no direct evidence for such simplifications . on the other hand , with a suitable higgs sector  sometimes also supplied with additional constraints from postulated discrete flavour symmetries  reasonable quark and lepton spectra can be obtained from gut models .",
    "often gut models also allow for naturally tiny neutrino masses through a see - saw mechanism , e.g.   induced by heavy majorana neutrinos .    in a slightly different context , grinstein , redi and villadoro @xcite",
    "have recently proposed an approach to generate the sm yukawa couplings _ in the quark sector _ from a see - saw mechanism , which is induced by heavy dirac fermions that appear in constructions with gauged flavour symmetries at ( relatively ) low energies ( for related work , see also @xcite and references therein ) .    in this letter",
    ", we are going to show that the mechanism in @xcite can be modified and extended in such a way that up - type and down - type quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos , as well as their heavy partners can be embedded into multiplets of @xmath0 .",
    "the fermion spectrum below the gut scale can be represented in an anomaly - free way with respect to a flavour symmetry group of the sm gauge interactions .",
    "in contrast to the original approach in @xcite , our modification also introduces new heavy @xmath7 doublets , and therefore , in principle , offers the potential to adjust the unification of sm coupling constants via the rg running and threshold corrections induced by the new fermions . furthermore , it can lead to a natural suppression of neutrino masses with respect to the masses of the charged leptons .",
    "finally , the @xmath0 fermion spectrum can be made anomaly - free with respect to the flavour symmetry of the gut theory by introducing a set of heavy fermions that are distinguished from the sm matter by a postulated @xmath8-symmetry and contain a sm singlet component which may serve as a dark matter candidate .",
    "the inclusion of heavy dirac partners for the sm particles is motivated by the requirement that the chiral anomalies related to the flavour symmetries of the sm gauge sector are canceled between sm quarks and their heavy partners , which would allow for a promotion of the global flavour symmetries to local transformations of a renormalizable gauge theory .",
    "this , in particular , removes the goldstone modes that appear when the flavour symmetries are to be spontaneously broken by the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of some scalar fields .",
    "the choice of quantum numbers for such fermion fields is not completely fixed : the model in @xcite contains the minimal set of fermions needed to reproduce the sm quark yukawa terms from renormalizable dim-4 operators , only .",
    "the approach discussed in @xcite already starts from an effective theory where the heavy fermions decouple from the sm fermions .",
    "the model that we are going to discuss in this work represents a modification of @xcite , based on dim-4 terms with different fermion content and couplings .",
    "let us first summarize the relevant expressions in the lagrangian relevant for energies _ below _ the gut scale .",
    "the down - quark sector of our model coincides with the construction in @xcite .",
    "it features a dim-4 lagrangian @xmath9 the notation for the new fermion fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 follows @xcite . here and",
    "in the following , we will not specify @xmath12 coupling constants for simplicity .",
    "the explicit dirac mass @xmath13 controls the coupling between the right - handed sm quarks with their heavy partners .",

    "it will achieve a vev from an ( unspecified ) potential .",
    "finally , the vev of the sm higgs doublet , @xmath15 , as usual , sets the scale of electro - weak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",

    "( iv ) upon integrating out the heavy partners of the up - type quarks , one generates an effective yukawa term for the sm up - quark fields with a yukawa matrix inversely proportional to @xmath49 .",
    "it is instructive to derive the number of light quark fields ( in the limit @xmath50 ) . from the three doublet ( six singlet ) weyl spinors ( for each family ) , two ( four )",
    "weyl spinors become massive due to the dirac masses generated from the scalar spurions @xmath51 , leaving one light doublet and two light singlets which are identified as @xmath52 in the sm .      in the lepton sector , we consider the flavour symmetry group @xmath53 , where the first two groups refer to the left - handed lepton doublet and right - handed singlet in the sm , and the last factor corresponds to an additional right - handed dirac neutrino @xmath54 for each family .",

    "notice , that for this purpose we did not have to introduce majorana neutrinos .",
    "the situation in the lepton sector is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ illul ] : ( i ) the sm lepton doublet @xmath70 and a new doublet @xmath57 transform in the fundamental representation of @xmath71 and couple via a fundamental dirac mass term , @xmath72 .",

    "the neutrinos receive a dirac mass which is doubly suppressed and stems from a yukawa matrix proportional to @xmath80 .",

    "the transformation properties of the sm quark fields and its heavy partners under the @xmath7 group of the sm and under the @xmath83 flavour symmetry in the quark sector are as follows , @xmath84   d_r^c \\sim 1_l(1,\\bar 3)_{-y_{d_r } } & & \\psi_{d } \\sim 1_l(1,3)_{+y_{d_r } } & & \\psi_{d_r}^c \\sim 1_l(\\bar 3,1)_{-y_{d_r } } \\label{quark_rep}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have also indicated the appropriate hyper - charges . concerning anomalies , it is easy to see that :    * the chiral anomalies from the new heavy quarks with respect to the sm gauge group cancel between the two last columns in ( [ quark_rep ] ) . * concerning the mixed anomalies between the flavour symmetries and hyper - charge ,",
    "we observe that the first two columns trivially cancel , while within the third - column the mixed anomalies cancel because @xmath85 .",
    "* chiral anomalies related to the @xmath27 cancel , as we have one left - handed triplet and one left - handed anti - triplet . chiral anomalies of the @xmath38 flavour symmetry group _ do not _ cancel by counting the number of left - handed triplets ( 2 + 1 ) and anti - triplets ( 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 ) .",
    "+ the anomaly - free representation in @xcite could be recovered by dropping the heavy doublets @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the alternative option that we are pursuing here is to add two more doublet fields @xmath86 the quoted hyper - charges follow from the embedding into a 24-plet in @xmath0 , see below .",
    "furthermore , in order to prevent @xmath87 from coupling to the other fermions , we introduce a discrete @xmath8-symmetry , dubbed `` @xmath88-parity '' in this work , under which @xmath87 are assumed to be odd , while the sm fermions and their see - saw partners are even .",
    "the mass term for the additional fields is given by @xmath89 the lightest of these states would have a mass of the order @xmath90 and may be detectable as a heavy quark doublet with exotic quantum numbers .    in the lepton sector , a similar analysis for the @xmath91 symmetry yields @xmath92 and @xmath93 where the cancellation of sm anomalies from the new leptons is obvious ( one new vector representation of charged leptons , trivial representations for right - handed neutrinos ) , while the cancellation of anomalies related to each flavour sub - group can be seen by counting the number of triplets and anti - triplets .",
    "we have thus shown that the flavour symmetry @xmath94 can be represented in an anomaly - free manner , and therefore we are free to introduce the corresponding gauge bosons which will become massive by the usual higgs mechanism as soon as the flavour spurions get their vevs .",
    "compared to the standard set - up of mfv @xcite , the up - quark sector is modified as the flavour symmetry is broken by a symmetric complex matrix @xmath49 instead of a generic complex matrix @xmath95 . counting the respective flavour parameters , we encounter 12 instead of 18 degrees of freedom in the spurion matrix , while the number of flavour symmetry generators is reduced by 8 compared to the standard case .",
    "this leaves two additional flavour parameters which can be traced back to relative phases between the heavy fermionic partners of the up - quarks , similar as for the majorana phases in the pmns matrix for the neutrino sector . in the low - energy effective hamiltonian for @xmath96- , @xmath97- , and @xmath98-meson transitions one",
    "thus encounters new sources for cp violation in addition to the sm ckm phase .",
    "this can be viewed as a particular example for next - to - minimal flavour violation as defined in @xcite .",
    "similarly , mfv in the neutrino sector @xcite , is modified as the fundamental sources of flavour violation now transform as @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and not as the neutrino yukawa matrix @xmath101 .",
    "still , the spurion fields obey consistency relations ( here between @xmath80 and @xmath101 ) as required in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that , at this point , the above considerations apply independently of a possible embedding into a grand unified framework . from the low - energy ( i.e.  below the gut scale ) point of view , our set - up provides an alternative realization of the idea proposed in @xcite with a different heavy fermion spectrum , different new sources for flavour phenomenology in the quark sector , and an interesting explanation for small _ dirac_-neutrino masses together with new sources for lepton - flavour violation .",
    "in addition , our set - up introduces new heavy lepton and quark doublets , which will contribute to the running of the sm coupling constant @xmath102 at energies between the scale set by the corresponding spurion vevs and the uv cut - off of the theory ( e.g.  @xmath103 ) .",
    "our aim is to find an embedding of the heavy - fermion spectrum identified in the previous sections in the context of a grand - unified theory based on @xmath0 fermion multiplets .",
    "the questions we want to address are :    * do the fermions fit in multiplets of @xmath0 ? * how do the various mass terms descend from an @xmath0-invariant lagrangian ? * how are the flavour symmetry groups below and above the gut scale related ?    for simplicity , we will use a symbolic notation in terms of left - handed weyl spinors and higgs fields , and again suppress couplings of @xmath12 . the coupling terms in the lagrangian , allowed by @xmath0 symmetry , and their decomposition into sm multiplets can , for instance , be found with the help of @xcite .",
    "we may assume in the following a minimal higgs sector with a @xmath104 breaking @xmath0 to the sm group , and a @xmath105 containing the sm higgs doublet responsible for ewsb .",
    "as the flavour symmetry group above the gut scale , we consider @xmath106 which is defined with respect to the gut multiplets , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , containing the sm fermions and the right - handed neutrinos .",
    "we further allow for scalar spurion fields @xmath110    looking at the fermion representations of the low - energy theory , as defined in ( [ quark_rep ] ) and ( [ lepton_rep1],[lepton_rep2 ] ) , we observe that    * the down - quark singlets and lepton doublets , together with their respective heavy partners , can be combined into three 5-plets of @xmath0 in a straight - forward manner , @xmath111 where in brackets , we have given the transformation under @xmath112 and identified @xmath113 and @xmath114 . *",
    "similarly , the right - handed neutrinos are represented by the @xmath0 singlets @xmath115 with @xmath116 . *",
    "the up - quark sector , on the other hand , is special and  at least in the set - up identified in the last section  prevents a straight - forward embedding into @xmath0 .",
    "while the sm fermions form the usual @xmath0 10-plets , @xmath117 in ( [ quark_rep],[lepton_rep1 ] ) , we only encounter heavy partners for the quark doublets and for the up - quark singlets , but not for the lepton singlets .",
    "+ however , completing the multiplets by @xmath118 we will see below that the additional fields @xmath119 and @xmath120 do not contribute to the yukawa terms in the low - energy lagrangian , as long as the triplet component of the @xmath105 higgs representation in @xmath0 is heavy ( which requires that the usual doublet - triplet splitting problem has been solved in one or the other way ) .    with this , one can write invariant mass terms for the down - type quarks and leptons ( in symbolic notation ) as @xmath121 which reproduces the lagrangians in ( [ dim4d],[option2 ] ) when decomposed into its sm components . integrating out the heavy fermion fields , the see - saw mechanism generates the effective yukawa matrices @xmath122 which generates the dirac masses for down - type quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos as indicated .    as a consequence of the unification of the charged lepton singlets with the quark doublets and the up - quark singlets , we may write down an additional term , @xmath123 which gives rise to a majorana mass term for the right - handed neutrino @xmath124 the masses for the up - quarks are realized by the following expressions , @xmath125 which reproduces ( [ eq : up2 ] ) together with the additional terms involving @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath126 when the triplet higgs component @xmath127 in @xmath105 is set to zero , the fields @xmath119 and @xmath120 can be integrated out without contributing to the effective sm yukawa couplings . integrating out the heavy fermions from ( [ upquark ] ) , we obtain the effective sm yukawa matrix in the up - quark sector , as before , @xmath128    finally , we may embed the fields @xmath87 , which we have introduced in ( [ philr ] ) in order to compensate for the chiral anomalies in @xmath38 , in a 24-plet of @xmath0 which is @xmath88-odd .",
    "this also fixes the hyper - charges quoted in ( [ philr ] ) , @xmath129 as indicated , this introduces a number of additional fermion fields , including a generation of sm singlets .",
    "the 24-plet allows for a unique mass term , @xmath130 such that the lightest generation would receive a mass contribution of order @xmath131 . if ",
    "after renormalization - group running to the weak scale ",
    "the lightest of the @xmath88-odd states turns out to be the sm singlet , and @xmath88-parity is unbroken , it may provide a dark matter candidate .",
    "let us again discuss the anomalies associated to the fermion representations of @xmath132 .",
    "* the @xmath0 anomalies in the @xmath88-even sector cancel , because we have the same number of left - handed 10-plets ( @xmath133-plets ) and @xmath134-plets ( 5-plets ) . notice also , that together with the three singlets they form complete 16-dimensional representation of @xmath3 .",
    "the 24-plet in the @xmath88-odd sector is a real representation of @xmath0 , and does not contribute to the anomaly . *",
    "the @xmath135 flavour symmetry has a vector - like representation with one @xmath136 and one @xmath137 , and the cancellation of anomalies is trivial .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath138 which contains a @xmath109 and one @xmath139 fermion representation . * the case with the @xmath140",
    "again is more involved : counting the triplet ( anti - triplet ) representations in the @xmath88-even sector , we obtain @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , leaving a mismatch of @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath88-odd sector overcompensates this number by adding 24 flavour triplets . in order to obtain an anomaly - free spectrum with complete @xmath0 multiplets ,",
    "the simplest option is to add @xmath140-triplets which are @xmath88-odd embedding , where the @xmath88-odd fermions and the higgs fields have even @xmath144 charges , and the @xmath88-even fermions have odd charges . ] and come in a vector - like representation of @xmath0 , @xmath145 being @xmath88-odd , these representations can couple only among themselves via a dirac mass term , @xmath146 or to the 24-plet via the @xmath105 higgs .",

    "in contrast to the original model , also electro - weak doublets appear in the heavy fermion spectrum , and therefore the unification of sm coupling constants at the gut scale , potentially , may be adjusted by the contributions of the new fermions to the renormalization - group running and threshold corrections .    in order to cancel the chiral anomalies related to the flavour - symmetry group , we have introduced a number of new fermion fields that are odd under a postulated new @xmath8-symmetry ( dubbed  @xmath88-parity in this work ) . from the @xmath0 perspective",
    "they can be organized into a 24-plet and two 5-plets .",
    "if the lightest of these fermions is the sm singlet contained in the 24-plet , it may serve as a dark matter candidate . on a more speculative level ,",
    "we have pointed out that our scenario requires an alternative to the conventional mechanism to break @xmath0 via a @xmath153 higgs field , in order to protect the fundamental dirac mass parameters against large contributions from the gut scale . answering this question goes beyond the scope of this work .",
