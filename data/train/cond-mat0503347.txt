    "the dephasing lead model was introduced by bttiker in 1986 as a phenomenological description of the loss of coherence in quantum electron transport @xcite .",
    "a microscopic theory of dephasing by electron - electron interactions exists in disordered systems @xcite , but not in ( open ) chaotic systems . for that reason ,",
    "experiments on conduction through a chaotic quantum dot are routinely modeled by bttiker s device  with considerable success @xcite .",
    "an alternative phenomenogical approach , introduced by vavilov and aleiner in 1999 , is to introduce dephasing by means of a fluctuating time - dependent electric field @xcite .",
    "this approach was reformulated as the dephasing stub model by polianski and brouwer @xcite .",
    "the two models , dephasing lead and dephasing stub , are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figstublead ] .",
    "polianski and brouwer showed that the weak localization correction to the conductance is suppressed in the same way by dephasing in the two models .",
    "the key difference between the dephasing lead and the dephasing stub is that the former system is open while the latter system is closed .",
    "because the quantum dot is connected to an electron reservoir by the dephasing lead , only _ expectation values _ of the current can be forced to vanish at low frequencies ; the outcome of an individual measurement is not so constrained .",
    "the quantum dot with the dephasing stub remains a closed system with a vanishing low - frequency current at each and every measurement .",
    "the difference is irrelevant for the time - averaged current ( and therefore for the conductance ) , but not for the time - dependent current fluctuations .",
    "indeed , recent studies of shot noise find differences between the two models of dephasing @xcite .    in the context of quantum information processing",
    ", the dephasing stub model seems a more natural starting point than the dephasing lead model .",
    "this is because quantum algorithms are based on the outcome of individual measurements rather than on expectation values , so the model for dephasing should conserve the particle number at each measurement  rather than only on average .",
    "the existing dephasing stub model , however , has an undesired feature that prevents its use as a phenomenological model for dephasing .",
    "@xcite considers a _ short _ dephasing stub , in which the mean dwell time of an electron is negligibly small compared to the mean dwell time in the quantum dot .",
    "the voltage fluctuations in a short stub drive the quantum dot out of equilibrium , as is manifested by a nonzero noise power at zero temperature and zero applied voltage @xcite . we need to avoid this , since true dephasing should have no effect in equilibrium .",
    "the original dephasing lead model had this property , that it preserved equilibrium . in this paper",
    "we will remove this undesired feature of the dephasing stub model , by demonstrating that a _ long _ dephasing stub can be an effective dephaser without driving the quantum dot appreciably out of equilibrium .",
    "it therefore combines the two attractive features of the existing models for dephasing : ( 1 ) current conservation for individual measurements and ( 2 ) preservation of equilibrium .",
    "the characteristic properties of quantum dot and stub are their level spacings @xmath0 and the contact conductances @xmath1 ( in units of the conductance quantum @xmath2 , ignoring spin ) .",
    "we assume that the dot is coupled to electron reservoirs by ballistic point contacts , with @xmath3 the total number of channels in these point contacts .",
    "the coupling between dot and stub is via a tunnel barrier with conductance @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the number of channels and @xmath6 is the transmission probability per channel ) .",
    "the limit @xmath7 , @xmath8 at fixed @xmath9 ensures spatial uniformity of the dephasing @xcite .",
    "we assume that the dynamics in the quantum dot and in the stub is chaotic .",
    "we define the heisenberg times @xmath10 , @xmath11 and the dwell times @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "the dwell time @xmath14 refers to the original quantum dot , before it was coupled to the stub .    in the short - stub model of polianski and brouwer",
    "@xcite the scattering by the stub is time dependent but instantaneous , described by an @xmath15 scattering matrix @xmath16 that depends on a single time argument only .",
    "we wish to introduce a delay time in the stub , so we need a scattering matrix @xmath17 that depends on an initial time @xmath18 and a final time @xmath19 . the difference",
    "@xmath20 is the time delay introduced by the stub .",
    "the reflection by the tunnel barrier is incorporated in @xmath21 , so that it also contains an instantaneous contribution @xmath22 times the unit matrix .",
    "the voltage fluctuations are introduced by a spatially random potential @xmath23 of the stub , with gaussian statistics characterized by a mean @xmath24 and standard deviation @xmath25 .",
    "averages @xmath26 over sample - to - sample fluctuations are taken using the methods of random - matrix theory @xcite , in the metallic regime @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "quantum corrections to transport properties in the metallic regime are described by two propagators , the diffuson and the cooperon , each of which is determined by an integral equation ( the dyson equation ) . in disordered systems , the dyson equation results from an average over random impurity configurations @xcite . in the ensemble of chaotic quantum dots",
    ", it results from an average over the circular ensemble of scattering matrices @xcite .",
    "the dyson equation for the diffuson @xmath29 has the form @xmath30 where the kernel @xmath31 is the diffuson of the stub , @xmath32 and we have defined @xmath33 .",
    "( [ diffusondyson ] ) reduces to the dyson equation of ref .",
    "@xcite if the time delay in the stub is disregarded ( @xmath34 ) .    in the presence of time - reversal symmetry",
    "we also need to consider the cooperon , determined by the dyson equation @xmath35 where the cooperon of the stub is defined by @xmath36      let us first consider the case of a stub without voltage fluctuations .",
    "then only the time difference @xmath37 plays a role , and not the actual times @xmath38 .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath39 .",
    "the cooperon need not be calculated separately , because @xmath40 .",

    "the result is @xmath45 the time @xmath46 corresponds to the dephasing time in the dephasing lead model .",
    "one can verify that the solution ( [ dnodephasinga ] ) satisfies the unitarity relation @xmath47    note that the two parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 always appear together as @xmath48 .",
    "this is a simplying feature of the metallic regime @xmath49 .",
    "since in this regime the tunnel barrier in the stub only serves to renormalize the number of channels , we might as well have assumed a ballistic coupling of the quantum dot to the stub . to simplify the formulas",

    "this is negligibly small relative to @xmath81 for sufficiently large bias voltages @xmath82 .",
    "these are still small bias voltages on the scale of the thouless energy @xmath83 , provided that @xmath84 . combined with our earlier requirement @xmath85 of rapid fluctuations ,",
    "we conclude that the noise generated by the fluctuating potential can be neglected in the regime @xmath86    it is the separation of dwell times @xmath87 , characteristic of the long - stub model , that makes it possible to enter this regime in which the fluctuating potential can be dephasing without being noisy .",
    "in contrast , in the short - stub model of ref .",
    "@xcite one is in the opposite regime @xmath88 in which the voltage fluctuations are either too weak to cause dephasing , or so strong that they dominate over the shot noise .",
    "a fluctuating time - dependent potential in a conductor has both a quantum mechanical effect ( destroying phase coherence ) and a classical effect ( driving the system out of equilibrium ) .",
    "the former effect shows up in the suppression of weak localization , while the latter effect manifests itself in the noise power .",
    "both effects have been studied extensively in the literature @xcite , and both effects are important if one is describing a conductor in a real microwave field .",
    "however , if the voltage fluctuations are to serve as a phenomenological model of dephasing , e.g.  by electron - electron interactions , then one needs to retain only the former effect  since shot noise should be insensitive to dephasing @xcite .",
    "the key question we have addressed in this work , is whether a fluctuating potential can be dephasing without being noisy .",
    "we have found that this is indeed possible , provided that the potential fluctuates not in the conductor itself but in a spatially separated and weakly coupled region ( the stub ) . the dephasing stub is a fictitious device , much like the dephasing lead @xcite .",
    "we expect that the dephasing stub model will be useful as a phenomenological description of decoherence in problems where one would rather not open up the system to an electron reservoir ( as one needs to do in the dephasing lead model )",
    ".    a recent paper by sokolov @xcite studies a similar geometry , a quantum dot connected to a long lead closed at one end , but in that work there are no voltage fluctuations in the stub . energy averaging can still suppress certain quantum interference effects ( such as the universal conductance fluctuations ) , but not others ( such as weak localization ) .",
