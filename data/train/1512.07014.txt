    "@xmath0 supersymmetric yang - mills theory ( sym ) is the supersymmetric extension of the gluonic sector of the standard model .",
    "it contains non - abelian gauge fields of an @xmath1 gauge group interacting with their fermionic superpartners , the gluino fields .",
    "different from the quarks of qcd , the gluinos are majorana fermions and they transform according to the adjoint representation of the gauge group .",
    "the complexity of sym is comparable to qcd .",
    "several basic properties , like asymptotic freedom , are shared among these two theories  @xcite . at low temperatures sym",
    "is assumed to confine the gluons and gluinos into colourless bound states , similarly to the mesons and glueballs in qcd .",
    "like in qcd , the investigation of the bound state problem is a non - perturbative problem that can be addressed by numerical lattice simulations .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is the essential feature distinguishing sym from qcd .",
    "if susy is unbroken , the bound states are arranged in supermultiplets , containing bosonic and fermionic particles with equal masses .",
    "the key aspect of the investigations of sym is to verify the formation of these multiplets the obtained mass spectrum provides insights into the low energy effective action of sym .",
    "effective actions have been constructed in  @xcite and extended in  @xcite .",
    "later the question about the existence of susy breaking vacua has been raised in  @xcite , which would imply a completely different mass spectrum .",
    "another interesting aspect is the existence of a stable light scalar in the theory , since in addition to the fermion , the multiplet always contains a scalar and a pseudoscalar particle . in sym",
    "the scalar is therefore a natural component of the effective theory , whereas the interpretation of its qcd counterpart is more controversial  @xcite .",
    "a light scalar state is also essential for technicolour and composite higgs theories .",
    "the predicted degeneracy of the multiplet masses provides a test of our methods for the challenging measurements of this state .",
    "an important characteristic of susy is the non - trivial interplay with the space - time symmetries .",
    "for example , the anticommutator of the susy generators @xmath2 is connected with the generators of translations @xmath3 : @xmath4 the absence of the infinitesimal translations generated by @xmath3 is an illustration of the unavoidable susy breaking on the lattice . in a more detailed",
    "analysis one can prove that supersymmetry is generically broken on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "in most cases there is no restoration of susy in the continuum limit without a fine tuning of certain susy breaking counterterms . in sym",
    "it is the fine tuning of the bare gluino mass .",
    "our simulations are an important test for the general applicability of non - perturbative lattice methods for susy theories .",
    "it is one of the few non - trivial four - dimensional examples where the complete restoration of susy in the continuum limit can be shown in terms of the ward identities and the degenerate mass spectrum .",
    "the main focus of our investigations is the spectrum of bosonic and fermionic bound states .",
    "in addition we have investigated the supersymmetric ward identities , static potential , thermal behaviour and other quantities .",
    "compared to qcd , the determination of the masses of meson - like bound states in sym is significantly more demanding , because all mesons are flavour singlets and the calculation of their correlators requires the notoriously difficult disconnected contributions . like their qcd counterparts , the glueball operators require a large statistics for a reasonable signal .",
    "this article concludes our studies of the bound states spectrum of @xmath5 sym , see  @xcite and references therein for previous work of our collaboration . in  @xcite a rather large gap between bosonic and fermionic masses in the mass spectrum was obtained . in later investigations  @xcite",
    "we have found that this effect significantly decreases at a smaller lattice spacing . in this article",
    "we present the results at a third , even smaller , lattice spacing , which allow an extrapolation to the continuum limit .    in sect .",
    "[ sec : symc ] we will give a short overview of the sym in the continuum .",
    "we describe the numerical setup for the lattice action and the analysis in sect .",
    "[ sec : nsim ] .",
    "[ sec : b190 ] summarises our new data at our smallest reliable lattice spacing . in combination with our previous results the new data allow the continuum extrapolation of the spectrum as presented in sect .",

    "sym has one conserved supercharge that transforms bosonic and fermionic states into each other . in particular the gluino , a spin-@xmath6 majorana fermion in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xmath1 , is the superpartner of the gluon .",
    "sym shows confinement at low energies and the gluons and gluinos form bound states . in that respect",
    "it is similar to qcd , where the hadrons are formed of the elementary quarks and gluons . on the other hand",
    ", sym represents the pure gluonic part of supersymmetric qcd and leads to the confinement of external fundamental charges , corresponding to heavy fundamental quarks .",
    "the linear rise of the static quark potential with a non - zero string tension @xmath7 is a measurable signal of this effect .",
    "since the fermions are in the adjoint representation , string breaking does not occur at any distance , like in pure yang - mills theory .",
    "a deconfinement phase transition is expected at a critical temperature @xmath8 that separates this low energy regime from the gluino - gluon plasma at high temperature .",
    "first results have been presented in  @xcite , a second order phase transition has been observed at a temperature @xmath9 mev in qcd units .    in the continuum",
    "the off - shell lagrangian of sym reads @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the covariant derivative in the adjoint representation .",
    "the auxiliary field @xmath12 , needed to ensure supersymmetry off - shell , has no kinetic term and can be integrated out from the partition function . after adding a gluino mass term , that breaks susy softly , the resulting on - shell lagrangian",
    "is thus given by @xmath13 in one - flavour qcd the action would look quite similar and the chiral symmetry would correspond to @xmath14 with a @xmath15 broken by the anomaly and the unbroken @xmath16 , which corresponds to the conserved baryon number . in sym the action is invariant under a @xmath17 chiral symmetry that is broken down to @xmath18 by the anomaly .",
    "the formation of the gluino condensate leads to an additional spontaneous breaking down to @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining symmetry corresponds to the fermion number conservation modulo 2 for majorana fermions .",
    "based on low - energy effective actions , predictions have been made for two low - lying chiral supermultiplets  @xcite .",
    "one of them contains a scalar meson @xmath20 , represented by the interpolating field @xmath21 , a pseudo - scalar meson @xmath22 , represented by @xmath23 , and a gluino - glue state .",
    "the gluino - glue is an exotic particle , which does not have a counterpart in qcd .",
    "it is a spin 1/2 majorana fermion , which can be created by the operator @xmath24,\\ ] ] with @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the other supermultiplet consists of a scalar @xmath26 glueball , a pseudoscalar @xmath27 glueball , and a gluino - glue particle .",
    "a lattice action for the euclidean version of sym has been proposed by curci and veneziano  @xcite .",
    "the action for the gauge fields is the usual wilson action , which in our calculations has been extended to the tree - level symanzik improved gauge action .",
    "the gluinos are described by wilson fermions in the adjoint representation . in our case",
    "stout smearing  @xcite is applied on the gauge links in the wilson - dirac operator .",
    "the curci - veneziano action explicitly breaks supersymmetry and the u(1)@xmath28 symmetry . to recover the continuum symmetries the necessary fine - tuning of supersymmetry and u(1)@xmath28 symmetry can be achieved through the same parameter , namely the bare gluino mass represented by the fermionic hopping parameter @xmath29  @xcite . to approach the limit of a vanishing gluino mass ,",
    "the bare parameter @xmath29 has to be tuned to the critical value @xmath30 that corresponds to the point where all explicit chiral symmetry breaking terms vanish .",
    "the value of @xmath30 is most easily obtained from the dependence of the adjoint pion ( @xmath31 ) mass on @xmath29 .",
    "the correlator of this particle is the connected contribution of the @xmath22 correlator .",
    "even though @xmath31 is not a physical state of sym , it can be defined in a partially quenched setup where the chiral limit is identified with the point where the adjoint pion mass vanishes  @xcite .",
    "the updates of gauge configurations are performed with the two - step polynomial hybrid monte carlo ( phmc ) algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the polynomial approximation is less precise for small eigenvalues of the hermitian wilson - dirac operator that can appear in the simulations for @xmath29 close to @xmath30 .",
    "when necessary , this error is corrected by a reweighting with correction factors in the analysis .",
    "these are obtained from the exact contribution of the lowest eigenvalues .",
    "our lattice formulation leads to a mild sign problem , arising as @xmath32 lattice artefact .",
    "the pfaffian obtained from the integration of the majorana fermions can sometimes have a negative sign  @xcite , especially close to the chiral limit .",
    "this sign is included in the reweighting , if necessary . to reduce the statistical errors we have chosen the parameters of our present simulations such that the reweighting with correction factors and pfaffian signs is not significant for the final results . in general the relevance of the reweighting",
    "is reduced at the smaller lattice spacings and for higher levels of stout smearing .    in principle",
    "it is also possible to formulate the model using ginsparg - wilson type fermions .",
    "in such a formulation the parameter values , at which the chiral and supersymmetric continuum limit is to be found , are known and thus do not need fine tuning .",
    "also , this formulation does not have a sign problem of the pfaffian . nevertheless , there is supersymmetry breaking at non - zero lattice spacings .",
    "interesting results have been obtained in some studies of the chiral condensate using this type of lattice formulation  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the mass spectrum requires , however , rather large lattices , which leads to a high computational cost with these formulations .",
    "we have found in our studies that the fine - tuning is feasible without problems , and our investigations could be done without ginsparg - wilson type formulations .       where the gluino mass vanishes , and then to the continuum limit , @xmath33 . the critical line @xmath34 separates the bare parameter space into two regions characterised by either a positive or a negative expectation value of the gluino condensate .",
    "chiral extrapolations at @xmath35 and @xmath36 have been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "[ lcp_susy_summary],scaledwidth=48.0% ]    we have chosen the lattice sizes such that finite volume effects can be neglected in comparison with statistical errors , based on our investigation in  @xcite . since lattice artifacts are the most relevant systematic errors , the most reliable results would be obtained at the smallest lattice spacings .",
    "the lattice spacing can , however , not be easily reduced to arbitrary small values since topology freezing introduces very large autocorrelation times and uncertainties in the observables at a small lattice spacing  @xcite .",
    "this problem can be reduced by choosing longer hmc trajectories in the gauge field update , for instance trajectories of length 2 , which we had in most of our simulations at larger @xmath37 values . in spite of",
    "that we have found a significant influence of topology freezing at @xmath38 , where the lattice spacing in qcd units ( where the sommer parameter @xmath39 is set to 0.5 fm ) would be around @xmath40 fm .",
    "for instance , at @xmath41 on a @xmath42 lattice we observe for the topological charge @xmath43 an integrated autocorrelation time @xmath44 , whereas at @xmath45 on a @xmath46 lattice we have @xmath47 .",
    "in addition to the longer autocorrelation , at @xmath38 it is very difficult to achieve a distribution of @xmath43 symmetric about 0 .",
    "topology freezing represents an upper limit for the parameter @xmath37 in the simulations unless open boundary conditions are introduced or the statistic is increased by about an order of magnitude .    in this work we present our new results of simulations at @xmath48 which are summarised in tab .",

    "the correlators for these particles are a sum of disconnected and connected fermion contributions . in qcd",
    "the connected part corresponds to the pion , while in sym an adjoint pion ( @xmath31 ) is not a physical state of the theory , but can be defined in a partially quenched setup  @xcite .",
    "it provides the best signal to noise ratio of all the considered states and the most reliable basis for determining the critical value @xmath30 of the hopping parameter where the gluino mass vanishes .",
    "the determination of the disconnected contributions is rather challenging .",
    "they are determined by a stochastic estimation combined with the exact contribution of the lowest eigenvalues of the hermitian dirac - wilson operator and truncated solver techniques to reduce the fluctuations of the signal .",
    "similar to qcd , the disconnected contributions yield the most relevant uncertainty in the mesonic operators .",

    "the glueball masses are determined on the lattice by operators based on the product of link variables . in our study the interpolating operator for the scalar glueball @xmath26 is given by the fundamental plaquette built from four links , while for the glueball @xmath27 it is given by the product of eight links with suitable shape  @xcite .    in order to reduce the contamination from excited states and",

    "an important issue in our approach is the determination of the point in parameter space where the theory is characterised by a massless gluino . in this point not only the explicit chiral symmetry breaking by the gluino mass disappears , but also , in the continuum limit , susy is restored .",
    "a renormalised gluino mass can be defined on the lattice by means of the supersymmetric ward identities ( swi )  @xcite .",

    "in this paper we have presented our latest results on the spectrum of bound states in sym .",
    "reliable lattice simulations are now possible thanks to the evolution of supercomputers and algorithms in recent years . another important step has been the localisation of the reliable parameters range for the simulations which is limited by finite size effects and topological freezing .    based on these recent developments we have generated a large set of configurations at different lattice spacings and gluino masses over several years . at each lattice spacing we have performed an extrapolation of the lowest bound state masses in the scalar , pseudoscalar , and spin-1/2 channel to the chiral limit at zero gluino mass . as we have shown , this limit is compatible with the restoration of the supersymmetric ward identities .",
    "our last set of data at @xmath65 allows to complete the extrapolation to the continuum limit .",
    "the extrapolations to the continuum limit show agreement for the masses within less than two standard deviations .",
    "this is consistent with the formation of a susy multiplet , which is expected to contain a scalar and a pseudoscalar boson in addition to the fermion .",
    "there are two important conclusions that can be drawn from these observations : a proper non - perturbative definition of the strongly interacting supersymmetric theory is possible and there is no breaking of susy in the low energy effective theory .",
    "this is equivalent to the absence of an anomalous or spontaneous susy breaking in this theory .    taking the unbroken susy in the continuum theory for granted",
    ", the second conclusion is that the lattice method can be applied in a non - trivial four - dimensional supersymmetric theory .",
    "susy , which is unavoidably broken by the discretisation , is like lorentz symmetry and chiral symmetry restored in the continuum limit in sym . in our case , this is achieved by a fine - tuning of the hopping parameter .    in a first , short study",
    "we have shown that the breaking of susy indicated by the mass splitting of the multiplet on a coarse lattice is significantly reduced when a tadpole improved clover fermion action is used .",
    "in addition , technical aspects of the methods are improved by stout smearing in the dirac operator .",
    "this indicates that clover improved fermions with stout smearing seem to be the best choice for future lattice investigations of the theory .    in our present investigation we considered only the mass of the lightest supermultiplet . a second chiral supermultiplet with higher",
    "mass has been predicted  @xcite .",
    "the determination of the mass of the second supermultiplet on the lattice requires the computation of the mixing between gluonic and fermionic operators .",
    "we plan to investigate this aspect in the near future .",
    "the analysis of the mass of the pseudoscalar glueball and of the excited state of the scalar glueball indicates that mixing might be rather weak in the @xmath27 channel . in this case",
    ", the second excited supermultiplet appears to be roughly twice as massive as the ground state .",
