    "almost ever all physical phenomena are treated in an approximate way .",
    "sometimes effects of minor importance are neglected alongside the analysis made , other times higher order corrections are abandoned when expansions are developed .",
    "thus , it is fundamental for undergraduate students of exact science courses , including physics , to dominate the use of approximations , mainly to have the ability of deciding which terms are outside the validity domain of the approximations made and that could therefore be disregarded . still , the student should know how to recognize if new analysed effects ( particularly minor importance effects ) have same order of magnitude of previously neglected ones and , consequently , they can not be neglected any more .",
    "however , it is well - known to teachers the great difficulty that students have in dealing with approximations . to recognize terms that could be discarded",
    "can represent a considerable challenge for them .",
    "mostly , their approach is done almost automatically without any concern with careful analysis so leading them to wrong results .",
    "the determination of the maximum period of oscillation for a simple pendulum oscillating in the vicinity of earth s surface is a good example of situations where watchfulness with treatment of approximations is absolutely necessary . at first , approximation for small oscillations",
    "is considered and terms of higher order in the oscillation angle @xmath0 are neglected .",
    "subsequently , the limit of pendulum length tending to infinity is used to determine the maximum period of oscillation .",
    "but , as we will see later , this procedure must be cautiously conducted .",
    "this means that we have to take into account in what conditions the approximations are valid and to learn what is the physical meaning of such conditions .",
    "as far as we know , gough was who firstly in literature called attention that even for very small angles of oscillation the period of a simple pendulum in a perfect vacuum , suspended from a perfectly rigid support by an inextensible string is not @xmath1 due to the radius of curvature of the earth  @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to explicitly calculate the maximum period for a simple pendulum oscillating around the terrestrial surface and , trough it , discuss the heeds students must take in using approximations and the conditions in which neglected terms are outside the validity region of the approximation .",
    "also , we intend to show how an ingenuous use of careless results can lead to mistaken conclusions .    although the determination of the maximum period of a simple pendulum is not unpublished , it is poorly known and its calculation is not such a simple matter . therefore an explicit demonstration showing the decomposition of the acting forces and the use of the newton second law is required .",
    "moreover in the papers found in literature  @xcite is not discussed the validity of the approximations considered , as we intend to do in this work .",
    "the idea of using the simple pendulum as scenario to discuss some specific subject is not new in the literature . in 2008 ,",
    "j. clement used the simple pendulum in order to illustrate that students have misunderstood primitive concepts of mechanics  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the study of the simple pendulum is important , not only because is one of the most frequent problem found in the textbooks of undergraduate courses , but also because a lot of others problems can be reduced to a similar problem to that of the simple pendulum .",
    "although apparently simple the study of a simple pendulum can be a very rich problem , as it can be seen in references [ 4 - 26 ] .",
    "the article is organized in the following way . in section [ period ]",
    "we calculate the period for amplitudes of small angles of a simple pendulum in earth s surface vicinity taking account the effect of the finite curvature of the earth . in section [ maximum period ]",
    "we derive the maximum period as the limit of the period of the simple pendulum when the length of its string goes to infinity .",
    "finally , we present our final considerations and conclusions in section [ concl ] .",
    "the physical case of interest here is a pendulum made of a negligible mass string of length @xmath2 and a point mass @xmath3 performing small oscillations nearby the terrestrial surface , that is , the simple pendulum .    for an observer at earth s surface , the forces that act on @xmath3 are the gravitational attraction exerted by earth , the tension provided by the string and the fictitious forces  @xcite associated to the frame of reference attached to the spinning earth .",
    "these fictitious forces are the well - known coriolis and centrifugal forces .    at fig .",
    "[ fig : espins ] we represent the main axes necessary for a description of the problem .",

    "now , @xmath7 is an axis through earth s centre and the fixation point of the string and @xmath8 is orthogonal to @xmath7 also in the plane @xmath6 at the instant shown .",
    "the figure indicates schematically the forces that act on @xmath3 , except for the coriolis force @xmath9 entering obliquely in the page , with perpendicular and parallel components relatively to the plane of the figure .",
    "the situation described here corresponds to the case where the trajectory s lowest point occur at latitude @xmath10 , where the axis @xmath11 alongside the pendulum string turns into anti - parallel to @xmath7 .",
    "the axis @xmath12 is perpendicular to @xmath11 and is also tangential to the trajectory of mass @xmath3 .        to avoid loosing the focus of this work , that is , to avoid deviating attention of the reader for the complexity that the solution becomes when",
    "fictitious forces are taken into account , rotation of earth will be disregarded .",
    "the main advantage of neglecting action of coriolis force is that the pendulum will oscillate at a fixed plane , so the mass path is a circle arc .",
    "that way , all axes in fig .",
    "[ fig : espins ] will be at the same plane all the time , so one can define unit vectors @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively tangent and perpendicular to the described arc at each instant of time . at last , with no loss of generality , one can consider also that this plane  the oscillation plane  is parallel to a terrestrial meridian ( because of the spherical symmetry ) .    with these simplifications , for an observer at the proximity of earth s surface@xcite",
    "the forces that act on @xmath3 are the tension @xmath15 along the string and the terrestrial gravitational attraction force @xmath16 along local earth s radius .",

    "[ fig : fgcomp ] shows how the components alongside those axes are obtained ( axes @xmath8 e @xmath7 are also displayed for reference ) .",

    "a naive analysis of result ( [ periodnml ] ) leads to the wrong conclusion that the period of a simple pendulum oscillating at vicinity of earth s surface would increase indefinitely as the pendulum length @xmath2 increases .",
    "the reader is probably asking why wrong if by principle he has yet that @xmath25 and also that the angle @xmath33 still continues to be small with @xmath2 increasing , since the oscillations continue to occur at proximity of the terrestrial surface .",
    "as we will show at a later subsection , this is not always true because earth s curvature has to be considered when the pendulum length is augmented excessively .",
    "figure  [ fig : estops ] depicts the details relating the angles of interest , from where we easily achieve @xmath34 therefore , when @xmath2 is not much lesser than @xmath35 , the fraction @xmath36 is not much lesser than @xmath37 and @xmath38 could not be negligible anymore .",

    "if the pendulum length is augmented keeping angular amplitude fixed , even for small @xmath39 the distance @xmath98 ( horizontal displacement amplitude ) is allowed to increase too much in a way that mass @xmath3 departs too much from the surface in view of earth s curvature .",
    "in such case , the distance @xmath23 from earth s centre to @xmath3 is no longer close to @xmath35 , nor the angle @xmath33 can be considered small .",

    "if the amplitude @xmath98 of horizontal displacement of @xmath3 , as measured from axis @xmath7 , is kept fixed then the angular amplitude @xmath39 must be reduced when pendulum length @xmath2 is increased , and this way the condition ( [ condconvg ] ) is assured .",

    "otherwise , in ( b ) it is the linear amplitude @xmath98 which is kept fixed . ]",
    "the main goal of this work is to discuss the use of approximations in solving physical problems , calling attention mainly to the care one must have when throwing away terms , namely , how to choose among the terms derived which ones can be considered negligible in order to get a good usage and a good validity of the approximate results obtained .",
    "even though the problem so far studied can be thought of as an academic one it is by no means a poor example .",
    "in fact , the determination of maximum period for a simple pendulum oscillating nearness the terrestrial surface illustrates in a simple way the essential points which we intend to call close attention from the reader . in determining the pendulum period , terms of @xmath99",
    "are neglected when the pendulum undergoes small oscillations .",
    "however , we have shown that this ought to be done with some precaution since several seemingly terms are in fact of @xmath100 or @xmath101 . therefore , while taking the limit @xmath77 to get the maximum period we are really admitting that @xmath2 can increase with no bounds and , in such circumstance , the ratio @xmath89 increases so much that those cited terms can become no more inappreciable even for the case of small oscillations .",
    "put this way , these terms could have the same order of magnitude than terms regularly kept in approximate expressions , that is , in the normal range of the validity region .",
    "thus , to assure validity of eq .",
    "( [ periodmod ] ) and also of the intended limit to @xmath80 it is necessary to impose that @xmath102 .",
    "we have shown that this is equivalent to make physical angular amplitudes @xmath39 decrease with increase of @xmath2 . from this condition",
    "we proclaim that , in order to obtain the maximum period of the simple pendulum at vicinity of earth s surface , the term `` small oscillations '' is to be understood as fixed small amplitudes of the horizontal displacement @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , in this case , it is effectively valid to take the limit @xmath77 to find the maximum period of oscillation @xmath103 since even if the length @xmath2 increases indefinitely the result ( [ periodmod ] ) remains inside the domain of validity for the approximations so far considered .    as we said at beginning of section [ sec : intro ] not only terms of higher order but also those of lesser importance were abandoned .",
    "so , we think it is worthwhile do discuss briefly how the effects of terrestrial rotation can influence the results gotten so far .",
    "the centrifugal force that acts on mass @xmath3 modifies the period with a correction term of smaller order which values at most @xmath104 ( at the equatorial line ) .",
    "thus , this will be a dominant term for small lengths and the behaviour shown at figs .",
    "[ fig : pervsl ] or [ fig : grafico1 ] for small @xmath2 is not reliable .",
    "nevertheless , the term @xmath89 dominates when the length increases too much .",
    "this way , we roughly conclude that effects of the centrifugal acceleration over the determination of the pendulum period are out of the region of validity for the approximations and the result ( [ tmax ] ) is fully adequate ( if condition @xmath105 is assured ) .",
    "besides , as is well - known  @xcite , the coriolis force causes mass @xmath3 to not oscillate in a fixed plane so the ulterior motion can be described as a combination of two independent simple harmonic motions with equal periods @xmath106 .",
    "this is valid for the coriolis contribution when small oscillations are analysed and when earth s curvature is not considered .",
    "curvature effects upon the period of oscillation are too complex to be dealt with and are out of this work s aims .",
    "finally , if the effect of finite curvature of the earth is sufficiently relevant to be taken into account then the effect of the gravitational gradient must also be taken into account in determination of the period of the simple pendulum , that is , the effect on @xmath107 due to the non - homogeneity of the earth @xcite .",
