    "quantum coherence has enabled intriguing phenomenon , such as quantized vorticity , in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) . when a trapped condensate is driven to rotate , singly quantized vortices form . in lower rotations ,",

    "several theoretical articles about binary - mixture condensates have expounded that both the interspecies and intraspecies interactions play an important role in determining the density patterns and phase separation of the condensates @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the abrikosov vortex - lattice state of a scalar bec , the vortex states of binary - mixture becs have various exotic structures due to the variety of interactions @xcite .",

    "@xmath3 is larger than @xmath4 , the system can be roughly separated into two regimes : a condensate with or without the central density hole .",
    "more exactly , it has been shown in the literature that there exist three distinct phases for the fast - rotating scalar condensate confined in a harmonic - plus - quartic potential .",
    "one is the vortex lattice without a hole ( vl ) , the second is the vortex lattice with a hole ( vlh ) , and the third is the giant vortex state ( gv ) @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see how the interspecies and intraspecies interactions play the role in the binary - mixture condensates under fast rotation and in particular , how the above - mentioned phases manifest in these systems .",
