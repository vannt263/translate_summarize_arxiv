    "the modern study of algebraic structures with axioms corresponding to reidemeister moves on knot diagrams goes back at least to the early 1980s with the more or less simultaneous work of joyce @xcite and matveev @xcite , drawing in some cases on previous work by takasaki @xcite and conway and wraith @xcite .",
    "assigning algebraic generators to the arcs in a knot diagram and interpreting crossings as operations paves the way for translating reidemeister moves into algebraic axioms .",
    "applying this formula to unoriented link diagrams yields the _ involutory quandle _ or _ kei _ structure ; generalizing to oriented link diagrams gives us the _ quandle _ or _ distributive groupoid _ structure .",
    "generalizing again to blackboard - framed diagrams as in @xcite gives us the _ rack _ or _",
    "automorphic set _ structure .",
    "a further generalization replaces _ arcs _ ,",
    "i.e. , portions of the knot diagram from one undercrossing point to another , with _ semiarcs _ ,",
    "i.e. , portions of the knot diagram from one over- or under - crossing point to the next .",
    "semiarcs are edges in the graph obtained from a link diagram by replacing crossing points with vertices .",
    "previous work has been done on the semiarc - generated algebraic structures arising from unframed oriented link diagrams , known as _",
    "biquandles _ @xcite . a special case of biquandles , applicable to _ flat virtual links _ or _",
    "virtual strings _ and known as _ semiquandles _ , is examined in @xcite with further examples appearing in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the method introduced in @xcite of obtaining invariants of unframed classical and virtual knots and links from finite racks to the case of _ biracks _ , the algebraic structure generated by semiarcs in a link diagram with axioms corresponding to blackboard - framed isotopy , first introduced in @xcite .",
    "the new family of invariants contains the quandle , rack and strong biquandle counting invariants as special cases .",
    "in particular , the fundamental birack determines the knot quandle and fundamental rack and hence is complete invariant up to ambient homeomorphism for oriented framed knots and unsplit links ; see @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we define biracks and give a few examples . in section [ s3 ]",
    "we describe a family of biracks containing alexander quandles , alexander biquandles , @xmath0-racks and silver - williams switches as special cases . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we define a counting invariant of unframed classical knots and links using finite biracks and define enhancements of the birack counting invariants using image subbiracks , framing vectors and birack polynomials .",
    "we end with some questions for future research .",
    "let @xmath2 be a set .",
    "*   * @xmath3 * _ diagonally bijective _ ,    @xmath4    in previous work such as @xcite , the components of @xmath5 were interpreted as binary operations or right - actions of the set @xmath2 on itself , with @xmath6 denoted by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we can write the yang - baxter requirement as three equations in the component maps : @xmath11 or in the notation of @xcite , @xmath12    recall that a _ blackboard - framed link _ is an equivalence class of link diagrams under the equivalence relation generated by the three _ blackboard - framed reidemeister moves _ , traditionally numbered according to the number of strands involved in the move : @xmath13    the birack axioms are chosen such that any labeling of the semiarcs in an oriented blackboard - framed link diagram with elements of @xmath2 satisfying the identifications @xmath14 corresponds to a unique such labeling after applying any of the blackboard - framed reidemeister moves .",
    "thus , the number of such labelings is an easily computable invariant of blackboard - framed isotopy .",
    "the condition that @xmath5 is a solution to the set - theoretic yang - baxter equation is equivalent to the condition that labelings are preserved by the type iii move with cartesian product @xmath15 indicating horizontal stacking and composition @xmath16 indicating vertical stacking .",
    "@xmath17    interpreting @xmath18 as the map defined at a negative crossing satisfies the _ direct _ reidemeister ii moves , i.e. the two two - strand moves where both strands are oriented in the same direction .",
    "@xmath19    the sideways invertibility requirement is needed to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the labels for the middle semiarcs in the _ reverse _ type ii moves , where the strands are oriented in opposite directions : @xmath20    the diagonal invertibility condition is required in order to guarantee the existence and uniqueness of the labels in the blackboard - framed type i moves",
    ". of particular importance are the bijections @xmath21 and @xmath22 ; these give the labels on a strand after a framed type i move as pictured .",
    "@xmath23    in fact , _ a priori _ we have two potentially distinct bijections @xmath24 and @xmath25 coming from the two oriented double - i moves .",
    "it turns out that the birack axioms imply that the two kink maps coincide :    @xmath26    since @xmath27 is birack , @xmath5 satisfies the set - theoretic yang - baxter equation and @xmath28 satisfies the invertibility requirements for type ii moves .",
    "thus , labelings of knot diagrams by elements of @xmath2 satisfying the birack labeling condition are preserved under regular isotopy . then the fact",
    "that ( see @xcite for instance ) opposite - writhe opposite - winding - number twists can be canceled using only type ii and type iii moves implies that @xmath29 for all @xmath30 , and we have @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath32    next we have a few basic definitions relating to the algebra of biracks .",
    "@xmath33    if @xmath34 then there is a bijection between the sets of labelings of any two oriented blackboard - framed link diagrams @xmath35 and @xmath36 which are related by blackboard framed moves together with the _ @xmath37-phone cord move _ : @xmath38    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    to define birack structures on a finite set @xmath42 without algebraic formulas for the component maps @xmath43 , we can give a pair of @xmath44 matrices with entries in @xmath45 encoding the component maps of @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , the _ birack matrix _ of a birack @xmath2 is the block matrix @xmath46 $ ] such that the entries in row @xmath47 column @xmath48 of @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively are @xmath51 and @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "note the transposition of the input variables for @xmath50 ; this is for backwards compatibility with notation from previous work .",
    "comparing the notation from @xcite , our @xmath49 is the upper right block matrix and our @xmath50 is the lower right block matrix .",

    "in this section we define two classes of biracks , @xmath56-biracks and @xmath1-biracks .",

    "then @xmath27 is a birack with kink map @xmath67 .",
    "we must check that @xmath5 is strongly invertible .",
    "first , note that @xmath68 so @xmath5 is invertible .",
    "next , the sideways map @xmath28 is given by @xmath69 with inverse @xmath70 . finally , for diagonal invertibility , we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 so @xmath73 .",
    "next , we must check that the set - theoretic yang - baxter equation is satisfied . in component form",
    ", we have @xmath74 commutativity in @xmath60 satisfies the second equation and reduces the first equation to @xmath75 .    for the purpose of defining counting invariants with @xmath56-biracks",
    ", we ll need _ finite _ examples . the simplest way to do",
    "this is to choose a finite abelian group , say @xmath76 , and choose elements @xmath77 such that @xmath78 are invertible and @xmath79 .",
    "then the set @xmath80 of @xmath81-tuples of @xmath82 forms a finite @xmath56-rack .",
    "a finite @xmath56-birack structure @xmath83 on an abelian group @xmath82 is a strong biquandle iff @xmath84 .",
    "the birack rank of a finite @xmath56-birack is the smallest integer @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "every @xmath60-module is an abelian group under addition with multiplication by @xmath87 and @xmath88 acting as automorphisms of the additive structure and multiplication by @xmath89 acting as an endomorphism .",
    "this suggests a way to generalize the @xmath56-birack definition by unabelianizing the group structure .",
    "@xmath90    it is a straightforward computation to show that @xmath91 and that we have diagonal invertibility with kink map given by @xmath92 .",
    "to see that the set - theoretic yang - baxter equation is satisfied , we note that @xmath5 gives us the yang - baxter component form equations @xmath93 the first equation reduces to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and the second requires that @xmath94 commute with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "a few special cases of @xmath1-biracks appear in the literature ; the case where the kink map @xmath97 is a biquandle known as a _ silver - williams switch _ @xcite , and in the quandle case , i.e. @xmath98 and @xmath99 , we have a quandle structure incorrectly referred to by the present author in previous work as `` homogeneous quandles '' ; a better term would be _ multiplicative alexander quandles _ as these need not be homogeneous in the sense of @xcite .",
    "the special case where @xmath100 is the automorphism group @xmath101 of a quandle @xmath102 and @xmath96 is conjugation in @xmath100 by a chosen inner automorphism turns out to be the key to the relationship between the knot group and the knot quandle ; see @xcite for more .",
    "by construction , there is a bijection between the sets of labelings of any two blackboard - framing - isotopic link diagrams by the same birack @xmath27 . in particular , as we increment the writhe of the components in the diagram , the number of labelings of a knot diagram by a birack has period @xmath37 in each component where @xmath37 is the birack rank . as in @xcite , we can sum these basic counting invariants over a complete period of framings to define an invariant of unframed ambient isotopy classes of oriented links , provided the labeling birack @xmath2 is finite . in particular , a link @xmath104 of @xmath105 components has writhe vectors in @xmath106 with respect to the labelings by a blackboard birack @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath107 @xmath108.\\ ] ]    @xmath109 @xmath110    we notice that the total numbers of labelings of both links over one framing period mod @xmath37 are the same , but the labelings occur in different framings . to exploit this information",
    ", we will need to enhance the counting invariant .",
    "an _ enhancement _ of a counting invariant is an invariant which specializes to the counting invariant but includes extra information to distinguish between labelings , making enhanced invariants stronger than the original counting invariants .",
    "one way to enhance counting invariants is to define a `` signature '' for each labeling which is well - defined under reidemeister moves on the labeled diagram ; the resulting multiset of signatures is then an enhancement of the counting invariant .",
    "examples include using quandle 2-cocycles to define a _ boltzmann weight _ signature for quandle labelings of @xmath111 ( see @xcite ) as well as using extra structure of the labeling object to define signatures ( see @xcite etc . ) . taking a generating function lets us express these multiset - valued invariants as polynomials by converting multiplicities to coefficients and signatures to exponents , e.g. the multiset @xmath112 becomes the polynomial @xmath113 .    as with the rack counting invariant , one easy type of enhancement involves keeping track of which framings contribute which labelings .",
    "let @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "then we have :    @xmath116 @xmath117 @xmath118    @xmath119 @xmath120 \\quad \\to \\quad \\left[\\begin{array}{cccccc } 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \\end{array}\\right]\\ ] ]    for our final enhancement of the birack counting invariants , we will use _ birack polynomials_. in @xcite a two - variable polynomial invariant is defined for finite quandles and extended to biquandles in @xcite and racks in @xcite .",
    "these polynomials quantify the way in which the trivial action of elements of @xmath2 on @xmath2 is distributed throughout the birack , as opposed to being concentrated in a single identity element as in a group .",
    "we will use a simplified version of the biquandle polynomial to define an enhancement of the birack counting invariant .",
    "@xmath121@xmath122 @xmath123    if @xmath27 and @xmath124 are isomorphic biracks , then @xmath125    if @xmath126 is an isomorphism , then @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 .",
    "next , we have a polynomial for subbiracks @xmath130 .",
    "this polynomial contains information not just about the subbirack @xmath131 itself but also about how @xmath131 is embedded in @xmath2 .",

    "in this section we collect questions for future research .",
    "it is clear that we can combine various enhancement strategies to define potentially stronger , if more unwieldy , multivariable enhanced invariants .",
    "computer experiments using _ python _ code suggest that the writhe enhancement is the most effective of the three enhancements considered in this paper for knots and links with small crossing number using small - cardinality biracks .",
    "does this remain true when the crossing number or size of the target birack is increased ?",
    "@xmath56-biracks generalize alexander biquandles and @xmath0-racks .",
    "what birack definition generalizes bilinear biquandles and symplectic quandles ? what is the generalization of coxeter racks to the birack case ?",

    "is there an analogous construction for biracks ?",
    "the straightforward generalization does not work , but perhaps there is a non - obvious solution .",
    "future work will undoubtedly include generalizing the yang - baxter cocycle invariants and quandle cocycle invariants studied in papers like @xcite and @xcite to the birack case . more generally , though",
