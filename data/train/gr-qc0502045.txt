    "it is well known that the constraint algebra for classical gravity is first - class ; however , following the standard dirac prescription for the quantization of constraints , the resultant quantum constraint algebra is partially second - class @xcite .",
    "since the dirac procedure is better adapted to quantum first - class systems , the partial second - class character causes difficulties when discussing this problem .",
    "another procedure for constraint quantization is known as the projection operator formalism ; for an overview of this method see @xcite .",
    "one advantage this method has over the dirac procedure is that it treats first- and second - class quantum constraints on an equal footing .",
    "the premise behind this method is that one first quantizes a classical system and then reduces the original hilbert space via a suitable projection operator to a subspace in which the constraints are satisfied to an appropriate level of accuracy ; see @xcite for a more complete discussion .. when mapped into a corresponding quantum system , the constraints are satisfied by a projection operator onto the ground state of an harmonic oscillator with @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xcite . ]    explicitly , we recall that the constraint algebra for classical gravity is given by \\{h_a(x),h_b(y ) } & = & _ , a(x , y)h_b(x)-_,b(x , y)h_a(x),[eq1 ] + \\{h_a(x),h(y ) } & = & _ , a(x , y)h(x),[eq2 ] + \\{h(x),h(y ) } & = & _ , a(x , y)g^ab(x)h_b(x),[eq3 ] where @xmath2 is the hamiltonian constraint and @xmath3 are the diffeomorphism constraints . while ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) maintain a first - class structure upon quantization , ( [ eq3 ] ) morphs into a partially second - class constraint due to the metric factor ; see @xcite for a further discussion .",
    "it is this particular behavior of gravity that we mimic with a simple , few - degrees of freedom quantum mechanical system .",
    "the initial problem under consideration is based on using the three components of angular momentum , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , as constraints . as a modification of this problem",
    ", we multiply each component of the angular momentum by a suitable , non - vanishing variable .",
    "it is convenient to describe both of these examples in parallel .",
    "we discuss a system of constraints that force the angular momentum @xmath4 , @xmath6 , to vanish . with the angular momentum @xmath7 ( summation implied ) , the action integral we choose is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes the lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints .",
    "note that the hamiltonian @xmath10 is identically zero in this example .",
    "this form has been chosen for simplicity so we can focus directly on the issues surrounding the constraints .    from the definition of the @xmath4 s",
    ", one can immediately determine the poisson algebra , given as usual by \\{j_i , j_j } = _ ijk j_k .",
    "since this bracket yields a lie algebra , our system is clearly a closed first - class constraint system @xcite .",
    "the action for our choice of the modified system is very similar in form , i.e. , @xmath11 where the essential change resides in the definition of the variables @xmath12 .",
    "for some smooth , non - vanishing function , @xmath13 , we define ( note : @xmath14 , etc . )",
    "@xmath15 for all @xmath16 , and choose for further study the particular example for which @xmath17 the symbol @xmath18 is a fixed constant equal in value to the physical value of planck s constant @xmath19 , namely @xmath20 erg - sec .",
    "when the classical limit is called for , and thus planck s constant @xmath21 , we emphasize that @xmath18 retains its original numerical value .",
    "we have chosen such a small divisor to emphasize the quantum corrections ; different divisors can be considered by rescaling @xmath22 and @xmath23 .    since @xmath19 dependence will play a role in our analysis , we do not set @xmath24 . in our choice of units ,",
    "both @xmath25 and @xmath26 have the dimensions of @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , the division of @xmath22 and @xmath23 by @xmath18 has been chosen so that @xmath28 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 can all be dimensionless .",
    "we further suppose that @xmath29 and @xmath30 ; hence , @xmath31 . due to an evident @xmath32 symmetry it suffices hereafter to consider @xmath33 .",
    "( the special case of @xmath34 is considered later . )",
    "we recognize , in this simple case , that we could absorb the factor @xmath13 by a redefinition of the lagrange multipliers in ( [ eq6 ] ) . in more complicated systems ( e.g. , gravity )",
    "this simplification is either very difficult or perhaps impossible .",
    "therefore , as a further analog , we retain @xmath13 as a part of @xmath35 .",

    "we now proceed by canonically quantizing our model ; a path integral quantization is discussed in section 4 .",
    "initially , let us assume our chosen canonical coordinates are cartesian coordinates suitable for quantization @xcite , and thus we promote the variables @xmath46 to a set of irreducible , self - adjoint operators @xmath47 that obey the standard heisenberg commutation relation , = i ^i_j . following the standard dirac procedure of constraint quantization ,",

    "in particular , we confine our attention to a subspace of the entire hilbert space corresponding to an eigenvalue of the total number operator of two .",

    "an important feature of the @xmath89 operator is the _ absence _ of zero in its spectrum when @xmath90 .",
    "this is a clear reflection of the partial second - class nature of the @xmath49 constraints .",
    "however , the spectrum of @xmath88 admits a lowest possible eigenvalue , and from that state ( or states ) we construct our projection operator . to ensure that @xmath91 , when @xmath92 , it is necessary to restrict @xmath22 so that @xmath93 .",
    "it follows that the lowest eigenvalue of @xmath88 is non - degenerate and is represented by the last entry in table 3 ( row 6 ) .",

    "we have successfully dealt with a quantum second - class constraint in the context of our restricted hilbert space .",
    "an analogous discussion would take place in higher - order , even - particle subspaces .",
    "in section 3 , we discussed the canonical quantization of the model , however , this is not the only procedure to quantize the system .",
    "we now focus our attention on a path integral approach . before discussing the projection operator in this language ,",
    "let us first show how the faddeev method @xcite would treat this example .",
    "the formal starting relation @xmath104dt}{\\cal d}p { \\cal d}q { \\cal d}\\lambda , \\\\\\ ] ] is replaced with the gauge - fixed expression @xmath105 where @xmath106 is some appropriate gauge choice .",
    "a simple identity leads to e^(i/ ) p_a ^a dt_b _",
    "c \\{^b}(\\{^b , f}j_c+\\{^b , j_c}f)dp dq . the first term in the determinant is zero by the @xmath107 functional of the @xmath45 s .",

    "e^(i/ ) p_a^a dt_b _ c \\{^b}_t f^3 \\{^b , j_c } dp dq .",
    "we observe that all the factors of @xmath13 completely cancel . as one",
    "can see the faddeev method is insensitive to the definition of @xmath13 , only that it be non - zero .",
    "hence , this method considers the @xmath45 s and @xmath44 s as identical constraints .",
    "this is not surprising since using this method we are satisfying the constraints classically , and as shown in section 2 , the constraints behave the same in the classical regime .",
    "it is often stated that the results of ( [ eq27 ] ) are correct up to terms of order @xmath19 . while this may be true ,",
    "the goal of quantization is to obtain correct @xmath19 dependence .",
    "otherwise bohr - sommerfeld @xcite would be an adequate quantization procedure .",
    "based on the discussion of section 3 we can acquire the correct @xmath19 dependence in the present case .    a coherent state path integral can also be used to calculate the matrix elements of the projector as shown in previous works @xcite .",
    "let us begin with a preliminary equation , namely ,    @xmath109    where @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are normalization factors , @xmath113 , @xmath114 is a @xmath115 matrix representation of the rotation algebra , @xmath116 denotes time ordering , and @xmath117 is a suitable functional of @xmath118 .",
    "following @xcite , we could integrate over @xmath119 with respect to a suitable measure @xmath120 to create the desired projection operator .",
    "however , it is equivalent and simpler to proceed as follows , @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the normalized haar measure of @xmath123 . consequently , + @xmath124\\label{eq31}\\\\ & = & \\<\\vec z''|0\\>\\<0|\\vec z \\,''\\>+\\<\\vec z \\,''|o_j\\>\\<o_j|\\vec z \\,'\\>+ ... \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ eq31 ] ) we can deduce that the physical hilbert space for every even particle sector is one - dimensional , while in the odd particle sectors the physical hilbert space is empty , as conjectured in section 3 .",
    "we can also construct the fundamental kernel for the modified case using the results of section 3 . specifically , . _",
    "l(z;z ) & = & z",
    " |00|z +z",
    " |o_lo_l|z + ... + & = & n  n[1++ ... ] .",
    "+ although the full nature of this kernel is unknown at present , we expect that every higher even sector contained in @xmath125 will also yield a one - dimensional physical hilbert space , based on the observed nature of the @xmath58 s .",
    "motivated by the quantization of gravity , we have considered a system that has classically first - class constraints ; however , upon quantization it transforms partially to second class . in the two - particle subspace and for all @xmath38 ,",
    "our modified system has the characteristic feature that for a suitably chosen @xmath97 , which generally depends on @xmath22 , we have @xmath126 an attribute shared by all quantum second - class constraints . if we were to take the limit @xmath127 , our projection operator would vanish , resulting in an empty physical hilbert space .",
    "thus , as part of the general theory of the projection operator method @xcite , we do _ not _ take such a limit .",
    "nevertheless , we observe that all properties of the @xmath59-constraints pass smoothly to those of the @xmath58-constraints as @xmath84 , including the dimensionality of the physical hilbert space .",
    "the results we have obtained could be extended to all particle sectors that admit a lowest possible eigenvalue .",
    "one may also be interested in extending our procedure to models with additional degrees of freedom , and finally extending the arguments to include fields .",
