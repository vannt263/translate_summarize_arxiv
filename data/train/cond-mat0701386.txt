    "charge - density - wave ( cdw ) is a paramount example of broken - symmetry ground state principally driven by the electron - phonon interaction and occurring in low dimensional materials .",
    "more than 50 years ago peierls first pointed out that a one - dimensional ( 1d ) metal coupled to the underlying lattice is indeed not stable at low temperatures @xcite . in most cases ,",
    "the instability in 1d leads to a metal - insulator phase transition .",
    "the excitation spectrum of the resulting ground state of such a coupled electron - phonon system is characterized by a gap absorption feature , as a consequence of the fermi surface ( fs ) nesting with wave vector @xmath1 , and by a collective mode formed by electron - hole pairs at @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to superconductors , the phase excitations of the collective mode are gapless . consequently , electrostatic potentials ( due to impurities , grain boundaries , surface effect etc . )",
    "break the translational symmetry and lead to the pinning of the collective mode .",
    "this ultimately results in a non conducting but highly polarizable ground state in 1d @xcite . by increasing the dimensionality of the interacting electron gas system",
    "the impact of the nesting is less relevant and the fraction of gapped fs is reduced .",
    "cdw transitions then lead in 2d to a pseudogap feature in the density of states and those 2d systems remain metallic down to low temperatures . that increasing the dimensionality less affects the fs is also well represented by the progressive suppression of the singularity in the lindhard response function at @xmath1 , which in fact totally disappears in 3d @xcite .",
    "furthermore , low dimensionality has a strong impact in the normal state properties , as well , which particularly in one dimension can be suitably explained within the tomonaga - luttinger liquid or luther - emery scenarios @xcite .",
    "the formation of cdw ground states is by now well documented in a broad range of low dimensional solids @xcite , among which we encounter the linear chain organic and inorganic compounds .",
    "an effective low - dimensionality has been also identified in the layered @xmath2te@xmath0 ( @xmath2=la and ce ) , which play host to a cdw state , described in terms of modulated cu@xmath0 sb - type structure ( pa / nmm ) based on alternating layers of square - planar te sheets and a corrugated @xmath2te slab @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that no clear electronic phase transitions are observed below 300 k , and the material appears to be deep in the cdw state even at room temperature .",
    "a substantial anisotropy in the electrical resistivity confirms the quasi-2d character of the charge carriers .",
    "the temperature dependence of the resistivity is moreover reminiscent of either a doped small - gap semiconductor or possibly a semimetal and is certainly far from that of a good metal @xcite .",
    "a superlattice modulation of the average structure has been observed via transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) @xcite and x - ray diffraction @xcite , with somewhat different modulation wave vectors for the two compounds .",
    "tunneling experiment @xcite and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) reveal furthermore a large cdw gap ( the arpes gap extends between 100 and 600 mev @xcite ) .",
    "the gap was found to vary in magnitude around fs rather differently for the two compounds @xcite , presumably reflecting the different lattice modulations .",
    "these observations essentially establish the lattice modulation in @xmath2te@xmath0 as a cdw , driven by an electronic instability of fs .",
    "since the title compounds are essentially quasi-2d materials , the fs is only partially gapped by the cdw transition , so that ungapped charge carriers contribute to the conductivity at low temperatures .",
    "heat capacity measurements at low temperatures also indicate a very small electronic density of states , consistent with the measured electrical resistivity @xcite .",
    "@xmath2te@xmath0 share several common features and similar properties with the related bilayer @xmath2te@xmath3 materials @xcite .",
    "the structural and electronic simplicity of @xmath2te@xmath0 and @xmath2te@xmath3 , combined with the large size of the cdw gap , makes these materials particularly attractive for studying the effect of cdw formation on the electronic structure of layered systems .",
    "one approach is to exploit optical spectroscopy methods , which are ideal experimental tools to get insight into the absorption spectrum of the investigated materials .",
    "optical data allow in principle to address both the gapped as well as the ungapped fractions of fs @xcite .",
    "we seek to identify and to discuss the gap excitation and the fraction of fs involved in the cdw transition .",
    "these measurements were also partially inspired by the desire to reconcile arpes results ( which show ungapped sections of fs @xcite ) with dc resistivity measurements ( typical for a bad metal @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the frequency dependence of the absorption spectrum will shed light on the possible non - fermi liquid nature of the electronic properties of these low dimensional layered compounds .",
    "we report the first comprehensive optical study on late@xmath0 and cete@xmath0 single crystals , which were grown in this case by slow cooling a binary melt , as described previously in ref . .",
    "samples grown by this technique are as close to stoichiometric as possible , having compositions cete@xmath4 and late@xmath5 as determined by electron microprobe analysis using elemental standards , with an uncertainty of + /-",
    "0.03 in the te content .",
    "the crystals were polished in order to achieve a clean surface for the reflectivity measurements .",
    "exploiting several spectrometers and interferometers , the optical reflectivity @xmath6 was measured for all samples from the far - infrared ( 6 mev ) up to the ultraviolet ( 6 ev ) spectral range , with light polarized parallel to the te planes .",
    "details pertaining to the experiments can be found elsewhere @xcite .     of late@xmath0 and cete@xmath0 at 300 k.",
    "the inset is a blow - up of @xmath6 emphasizing the broad mid infrared absorption feature in the spectral range around 6000 @xmath7 .",
    "the arrows mark the shallow minimum in @xmath6 at the onset of the broad absorption , peaked between 5000 and 6000 @xmath7 and overlapped to the plasma edge feature.,width=321 ]    figure 1 displays @xmath6 for both title compounds over the whole investigated spectral range .",
    "@xmath6 does not display any temperature dependence between 300 and 10 k in the covered energy interval and merges to total reflection for frequency going to zero for both compounds .",
    "the @xmath6 spectra are therefore typical of an overall metallic behaviour .",
    "overlapped to the plasma edge feature ( for @xmath8 @xmath7 ) one can observe furthermore a rather broad absorption peaked at about 6000 @xmath7 .",
    "this feature is emphasized by the blow - up of @xmath6 ( inset fig .",
    "1 ) in the spectral range around 6000 @xmath7 .     of late@xmath0 and cete@xmath0 . arrows mark the position of the mid infrared peak for each compound ( see text ) .",
    "inset : drude - lorentz fit for cete@xmath0 , showing the experimental data , the fitted curve , the drude and the lorentz components.,width=321 ]    these characteristic fingerprints of the electrodynamic response in @xmath2te@xmath0 are even better highlighted in the real part @xmath9 of the optical conductivity , shown in fig .",
    "@xmath9 is achieved through standard kramers - kronig transformation @xcite of @xmath6 . to this purpose @xmath6",
    "was extended towards zero frequency ( i.e. , @xmath10 ) with the hagen - rubens extrapolation @xmath11)=@xmath12 and with standard power - law extrapolations at high frequencies ( i.e. , @xmath13 x10@xmath14 @xmath7 ) .",
    "the dc conductivity values employed in the hagen - rubens extension of @xmath6 are in fair agreement with transport measurements @xcite . in @xmath9",
    "we observe the so - called effective drude resonance below 1000 @xmath7 , due to the free - charge carriers , and the mid infrared absorption at 5000 and 6000 @xmath7 for cete@xmath0 and late@xmath0 ( arrows in fig .",
    "2 ) , respectively , which will be later ascribed to the single particle excitation across the cdw gap . at higher frequencies",
    "there is also a broad feature centered at about 2x10@xmath14 @xmath7 signaling the onset of electronic interband transitions .",
    "tight binding band structure calculations reveal indeed the presence of excitations due to the electronic interband transitions well above 1 ev @xcite .    in order to facilitate the discussion and",
    "for better identifying the characteristic features in the electrodynamic response of these rare - earth di - tellurides , we describe their absorption spectrum within the lorentz - drude phenomenological approach @xcite .",
    "it consists in reproducing the dielectric function by the following expression : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the optical dielectric constant , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the plasma frequency and the width of the drude peak , whereas @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the center - peak frequency , the width , and the mode strength for the @xmath22-th lorentz harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 is then obtained from @xmath23 .",
    "the fits of all spectra were extended up to 4x10@xmath14 @xmath7 . besides the drude contribution , four lorentz h.o.s for each compound are required to fit all features at finite frequencies .",
    "the three lowest frequency h.o.s will be associated below with the cdw gap excitation , while the fourth one will represent the first excitation at the onset of the high frequency electronic transitions .",
    "this is explicitly shown in the inset of fig . 2 for the ce - compound , where the fit components are displayed together with the total fit .",
    "the fit quality is astonishingly good for both investigated compounds .",
    "the depletion in the @xmath9 spectrum ( fig .",
    "2 ) between the drude component and the absorption feature at about 6000 @xmath7 bears a rather striking similarity with the situation encountered in the absorption spectrum of the bilayer @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite . therefore making use of the analogous notation of ref . , we claim that such a depletion in @xmath9 identifies the onset for the excitation across the cdw gap into the single particle ( @xmath24 ) states , giving rise to the mid infrared absorption . from now on we will refer to this mid infrared absorption as @xmath24 peak .",
    "we note from fig . 2 and its inset that the @xmath24 peak coincides with the third lorentz h.o .",
    "at about 5000 and 6000 @xmath7 for cete@xmath0 and late@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "nonetheless , this @xmath24 absorption feature is also characterized by a rather broad low frequency tail ( represented in the fit by the two lowest h.o.s ) , which extends well within the high frequency tail of the drude component .",
    "this might indicate , on the one hand , that the metallic component is not simply drude - like and that some localization occurs , or on the other hand , that the @xmath24 peak in each compound can be thought as composed by the superposition of several excitations .",
    "these latter excitations , in analogy to @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite , would mimic a continuous distribution of gap values , as seen in arpes @xcite .",
    "this would also mean that the cdw gap differently affects the fermi surface ( fs ) , with perfectly nested regions of fs with a large gap and non - perfectly nested ones with a small gap .",
    "following our previous work on @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite and tending towards the scenario in which the data are described by a distribution of gaps , we can similarly introduce a so - called averaged quantity @xmath25 : @xmath26 which represents the center of mass of the @xmath24 excitation .",
    "we believe that @xmath25 provides an average single energy scale , estimating the optical cdw gap .",
    "table i displays the values of @xmath25 for both compounds .",
    "@xmath25 for the rare - earth di - tellurides decreases by almost a factor of two going from la to ce , while it was almost identical between cete@xmath3 and late@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath25 in late@xmath0 is comparable to the value for late@xmath3 and in cete@xmath0 is smaller than in cete@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "our gap values in @xmath2te@xmath0 lie in the interval of cdw gaps , estimated from arpes data @xcite .",
    "the spectral weight encountered in the drude component is also of interest : the plasma frequency @xmath17 in the cdw state remains almost constant ( table i ) in the la and ce di - tellurides , while it slightly increases from late@xmath3 to cete@xmath3 .",
    "@xmath17 obviously refers to the ungapped fraction of fs , thus responsible for the effective metallic behaviour even within the cdw phase .",
    "for these ungapped carriers in the cdw state , we assume a 2d free - holes scenario .",
    "the sommerfeld @xmath27-value of the specific heat and the charge carriers effective mass @xmath28 in the cdw phase are related by @xcite : @xmath29 using @xmath30 j / molk@xmath31 for late@xmath0 @xcite , we achieve @xmath28 for both compounds , as reported in table i. we can now exploit @xmath17 in order to obtain the free charge carriers concentration in the cdw state , listed in table i , as well .",
    ".the first two columns summarize the values @xmath17 and @xmath25 ( eq . ( 2 ) ) , both in @xmath7 .",
    "the third column reports the ratio @xmath32 between the drude spectral weights ( see text ) in the cdw and normal state .",
    "the last four columns report the effective mass @xmath33 and carriers density @xmath34 in the normal state and effective mass @xmath28 and carriers density @xmath35 in the cdw state for both samples .",
    "carriers densities and effective masses are given in carriers / cell and @xmath36 units , respectively . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is now worth extending this analysis to the hypothetical normal state ( ns ) , which should develop at temperatures much higher than 300 k. again we make use of our previous analysis for the rare earth tri - tellurides @xcite and we exploit an elementary 2d tight - binding calculation involving the te p@xmath37 and p@xmath38 orbitals @xcite .",
    "the fermi energy , associated to the holelike charge - carriers , is @xmath39 ev .",
    "therefore , considering a parabolic expansion of the 2d bands around their maximum , @xmath40 is then related to the effective mass @xmath33 in the ( hypothetical ) ns by @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the 2d hole density in ns . with @xmath43 ( @xmath44=4.5  , for both compounds @xcite ) ,",
    "the resulting @xmath33 are reported in table i. @xmath28 and @xmath33 describe the average curvature of the free charge carriers bands in cdw and ns , respectively .",
    "there is approximately a factor of four between @xmath33 and @xmath28 ( in the @xmath2te@xmath3 compounds it was a factor of 2 @xcite ) .",
    "such a difference suggests again that in the cdw phase the average curvature of the bands is larger than in ns .",
    "the @xmath33 values allow us to extract the ns charge carrier s concentration @xmath34 , which can be then directly compared with @xmath45 , estimated from the chemical counting @xcite .",
    "prerequisite for the achievement of @xmath34 is first of all the estimation of the total spectral weight associated to the itinerant charge carriers in ns .",
    "if we assume the conservation of the spectral weight between the cdw and the normal state , and that there will be no @xmath24 peak in the ( hypothetical ) ns , the drude contribution in ns would then have a total spectral weight given by @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "therefore , from @xmath47 we obtain @xmath34 as reported in table i. the @xmath34 values are indeed very close to @xmath45=2 @xcite . while differences in the stoichiometry of the two compounds due to te vacancies might account for a small part of this difference , the origin of the discrepancy most likely lies in the approximations we have used to extract @xmath34 .",
    "given the experimental uncertainties , the rather fair agreement between @xmath34 and @xmath45 adds confidence to the reliability of our analysis .    from our data",
    "we can also estimate the quantity @xmath48 ( table i ) , representing the ratio between the spectral weight of the drude peak and the total spectral weight of the drude term and mid infrared absorption . @xmath32",
    "roughly measures , as previously shown in ref . , the fraction of the ungapped fs area ( i.e. , those parts of fs which are not affected by the cdw state ) . since @xmath32 is proportional to ( @xmath49 ) , it turns out to be about a factor four larger than the carriers ratio in both systems ( table i ) .",
    "the very small values of @xmath32 , however comparable to those of @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite , confirm that a large ( and almost equal ) portion of fs for both la and ce di - tellurides is gapped .",
    "large gapped regions of fs has been also evinced from recent arpes data , even though the relative ratio of the gapped regions was found to be rather different for the two compounds @xcite .",
    "the presence of only a very small numbers of carriers at the fermi energy would explain the bad metallicity observed by electrical conductivity as well as heat capacity @xcite .",
    "we also note that there is a substantial disorder in the la compound arising from the te vacancies , an effect all but absent in the stoichiometric tri - telluride compounds .",
    "therefore , polaronic and/or localization effects may also play a significant role in substantially reducing the conductivity .     of @xmath2te@xmath0 ( @xmath2=la and ce ) plotted on a bi - logarithmic scale .",
    "the y - axis is scaled by the maximum of the mid infrared peak in @xmath50 , while the energy axis is scaled by the frequency where the maximum in @xmath9 occurs .",
    "the solid lines are power - law fits to the data ( the exponents are given in the figure).,width=321 ]    we have also observed a power - law behaviour ( @xmath51 ) in @xmath2te@xmath0 for frequencies above @xmath25 .",
    "this is shown in fig . 3 for both investigated compounds , using a scaled representation . @xmath52 for @xmath2te@xmath0 ranges between -0.7 and -1 for the la and ce compounds , respectively .",
    "these @xmath52 values compare rather well with those in @xmath2te@xmath3 and the power - law behaviour extends over an equivalent spectral range , as well @xcite . such a power - law behaviour may be a further evidence for a typical tomonaga - luttinger liquid scenario , and emphasizes a non - negligible contribution of 1d correlation effects in the physics of these 2d compounds @xcite . an exponent @xmath52 close to -1 could suggest a so - called antiadiabatic limit in the sense that one could integrate over the phonon field .",
    "the phonon fluctuations would then introduce an effective interaction between the particles .",
    "however , this scenario would be extremely unlikely since one would need characteristic phonon modes above 1 ev @xcite .",
    "alternatively an exponent @xmath52 of the order of -1 could be reconciled with the theory if one assumes direct interaction between electrons , as source for umklapp scattering @xcite .",
    "as shown already for @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite , this theoretical framework would then be in reasonable agreement with the observed experimental behaviour in @xmath2te@xmath0 , as well .",
    "consequently a standard electron - phonon mechanism in @xmath2te@xmath0 , as well as in @xmath2te@xmath3 , may not be enough to fully account for the cdw formation .",
    "finally , we note that the low frequency side of @xmath9 below the @xmath24 peak also possibly hints to a power - law behaviour with @xmath53 ( not shown ) .",
    "however , such an exponent @xmath52 in @xmath2te@xmath0 differentiates quite substantially from the values encountered in the ce and la tri - tellurides @xcite . in these latter compounds",
    "@xmath54 at @xmath55 , which has been considered as a further clear indication for umklapp processes ; the dominant source of scattering underlying a 1d mott ( insulating ) state @xcite . any attempt to elucidate such a puzzling difference in the low frequency power - law behaviour between di- and tri - tellurides would be rather speculative at this point , since the observed low frequency power - law in @xmath2te@xmath0 develops over too small of a spectral range .",
    "in summary , we have described the optical response in @xmath2te@xmath0 for @xmath2=la and ce . our data ,",
    "besides revealing the @xmath24 excitation across the cdw gap , also indicate that a large portion of fs is gapped for both compounds .",
    "this strengthens the view of the rare - earth di - tellurides as poor metals with small density of states at the fermi level . from the high frequency power - law behaviour we evinced a hidden one - dimensional behaviour in these quasi-2d layered compounds , similar to that which is observed for the closely related @xmath2te@xmath3 compounds .",
    "arpes and thermodynamic experiments have pointed out the sensitive role played by perturbation , like te vacancies , on the cdw state @xcite .",
    "such a sensitivity is even stronger than in @xmath2te@xmath3 and it has been mainly associated with the observation that the nesting wave vectors , particularly in cete@xmath0 , are somewhat poorly defined @xcite . besides the te deficiencies , changes in the rare earth ( chemical pressure ) may also lead to subtle differences in the lattice modulation .",
    "therefore , applied pressure might also affect to some extent the electronic structure and the cdw condensate and might therefore be used to differentiate between the effects of chemical pressure and vacancy concentration in determining the differences between these two compounds .",
    "analogous to @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite pressure dependent optical investigations may be of great relevance .",
    "such investigations are in progress and will be reported elsewhere .",
    "the authors wish to thank j. mller for technical help and v. brouet for fruitful discussions .",
    "one of us ( a.s . ) wishes to acknowledge financial support from the della riccia foundation .",

    "this work is also supported by the department of energy , office of basic energy sciences under contract de - ac02 - 76sf00515 .",
    "the gap values determined from the arpes experiments are always referred with respect to the fermi energy . assuming the fermi energy in the middle of the gap , means that the optically determined gap is about twice as large as the arpes one .",
    "analogous to @xmath2te@xmath3 @xcite , we use the @xmath27 value of late@xmath0 for cete@xmath0 , as well . for magnetic members of the rare - earth series",
    "is difficult to extract @xmath27 from thermodynamic experiments .",
    "however , since the chemical and structural changes across the series are small and even though the modulation wave vectors and density of states at @xmath40 are rather different among the two compounds @xcite , the assumption of equal @xmath27 for both compounds seems at this point to be a reasonable approximation .",
    "the ionic configuration of @xmath2te@xmath0 is considered to be @xmath56te(2)@xmath57te(1)@xmath58 so as to produce hole carriers in the te(1 ) sheets , precisely one hole for each formula unit . since the unit - cell contains 2 formula unit , the number of the hole carriers ( @xmath45 ) inside the unit cell is 2 , as the number of te(1)@xmath58 atoms in the planar sheets @xcite .",
