    "spps with apolar alignment also exhibit a similar phase , however these particles also display an intringuing disordered phase where particle self - segregation in the form of highly dynamical bands occur .",
    "this means that in a coarse - grained description of these systems , the homogeneous disordered phase should get unstable by the emergence of soliton - like structures , the travelling bands , for polar alignment while for apolar alignment , local alignment has to lead to the formation of highly dynamical region . in the case of apolar alignment",
    ", the onset of global order is not associated to the instability of the disorder homogeneous state , as for polar alignment , but with the stability of the dense region . on the other extreme , well in the `` homogeneous ''",

    "the formation of dense regions in both systems is still lacking . for polar alignment , there are some promising recent theoretical results  @xcite that provide an interesting perspective to this puzzling issue .",
