    "the long  observation we have reported on here , allows us to investigate the properties of a sfxt as continuously as possible within one single orbital cycle for the first time .",
    "this has been made possible by the short orbital period of which is the sfxt with the shortest orbit known to date .",
    "the x  ray source shines with an average low luminosity l@xmath56@xmath110@xmath22  erg  s@xmath17 , ( if a distance of 2.8 kpc is assumed ) and no bright flares ( exceeding l@xmath56@xmath110@xmath58  erg  s@xmath17 ) have been caught during this observation .",
    "nevertheless , a high amplitude variability is observed , spanning more than two orders of magnitude ( including the x  ray eclipse ) .",
    "the absence of signatures from highly ionizing illuminating continuum further confirms a low source x  ray luminosity .",
    "we can distinguish several types of variability on different timescales , especially evident in the energy range 310 kev . on long timescales of tens of ks",
    "we observe three main intensity states : the end of the eclipse by the supergiant companion ( which we covered for about 46 ks ) , a transition phase to the uneclipsed emission ( time interval n.2 in fig .  1 , lasting 38 ks ) and the intra - flare low luminosity emission which covers most of the remaining orbit ( 40% ) , lasting around 110 ks ( time intervals n.5 and n.8 )",
    ".    x  ray flares with different durations are present : two main low luminosity flares , lasting 1015 ks , with a complex and structured shape , punctuate the orbit , reaching peak luminosities of 4.4 and 6.4@xmath1110@xmath22  erg  s@xmath17 ( at 2.8 kpc ) , separated by about 0.2 in orbital phase .",
    "their 0.210 kev spectra are harder than the intra - flare x  ray emission , as usually observed in sfxts and accreting pulsars .",
    "even in the part of the orbit in - between the two main low luminosity flares , the source exhibits a large intensity variability on timescale of 1000 s. this low luminosity flaring activity had already been unveiled in sfxts ( and in ) thanks to /xrt long term monitoring observations @xcite .    in the softer light curve the x ",
    "ray eclipse appears longer and there is no evidence for the presence of the transition phase ( time interval n.2 ) clearly present in the hard light curve .",
    "thus the eclipse egress appears to be energy dependent .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that reported by @xcite from the shape of the  folded light curves observed with  and with /bat , where the x  ray eclipse seems more evident at higher energies and with sharper transitions .",
    "there is also a similarity of the  temporal variability near eclipse egress with what has been observed in the hmxb 4u170037 ( @xcite and references therein ) , showing a variable eclipse duration and a similar egress phase .",
    "the long duration ( 38  ks ) of this phase roughly corresponds to a region as large as the companion radius ( although a precise determination of both the donor radius and of the system inclination is lacking ) , probing the innermost structure of the supergiant wind .    on shorter timescales of around 1000",
    "s we observe two sharp transitions , indicated in fig.[fig : ramp ] by the four contacts t@xmath59 : ( 1 ) from the eclipse to time interval n.  2 , which shows an intermediate level between the eclipse remaining flux and the un - eclipsed flux , and ( 2 ) from time interval n.  2 to the first flare .",
    "given that the compact object is point - like with respect to the supergiant companion , the first short transition likely probes the transition out off behind the stellar atmosphere , which , assuming an orbital velocity of a few hundreds km  s@xmath17 , results in a linear size of around a few 10@xmath60  cm .",
    "the second sharp transition is interestingly coincident with the rising phase to the first x  ray flare , suggesting a possible physical connection ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "an iron line is detected along the orbit , with a line energy of 6.4 kev , indicative of neutral iron or an ionization state lower than fe  xviii @xcite .",
    "a correlation is observed between the iron fluorescent line flux and the illuminating unabsorbed flux above 7  kev , as expected @xcite outside the eclipse ( fig .",
    "[ fig : timesel_fe ] ) .",
    "the line flux observed during eclipse does not show evidence for a reduction , within the large uncertainties , with respect to the value detected during the intra - flare emission , so most of the fluorescing matter is located far away from the compact object .",
    "note that we calculate the equivalent width of the line with respect to a single power - law continuum .",
    "if the fluorescing matter is optically thin to the illuminating continuum , the luminosity of the iron k@xmath61 line depends on the spectrum and x  ray luminosity of the central source , on the covering fraction of the illuminated matter and iron abundance ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "given the large uncertainties on the ew ( especially huge during the eclipse phase ) and the variability of the covering factor along the orbital phase , also considering the likely presence of different large - scale structures in the supergiant wind which can be obvious , although unknown , sites of fluorescing material , it is not possible to gain further constraints on the properties of the reprocessing wind ( also the supergiant surface becomes a reprocessor only visible at certain orbital phases ) .",
    "considering the spectroscopy , a more physical description of the x  ray spectrum in an eclipsing hmxb involves the presence of two power - law continua , accounting for the direct and scattered component with the latter produced by thomson scattering by free electron in the companion wind and/or on the supergiant surface @xcite .",
    "both the direct and the scattered components should have the same spectral slope , since thomson scattering is energy independent .",
    "this implies that the only way to disentangle these two components is the different absorptions , the scattered component being less absorbed than the direct one . during the x  ray eclipse , where the direct component is unseen",
    ", the x  ray emission should only be due to scattering .",
    "indeed , fitting this spectrum with a power - law with a photon index fixed at the average slope of @xmath49=1.35 , the eclipse shows the lowest absorption , consistent with the interstellar value @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , given the high absorption ( local and interstellar ) and the low statistics , we could not find better contraints to the spectral parameters adopting more complex models .",
    "also the egress x  ray emission ( n.  2 ) in  is likely dominated by the scattered component , given the high ew of the iron line compared to that measured during the out - of - eclipse emission ( time intervals from n.  3 to n.  8) .",
    "a possibility is that most of the direct x ",
    "ray emission in this orbital region is blocked by a large scale wind structure , as that invoked to explain the periodically recurrent outbursts in the sfxt igr  j112155952 @xcite , or by dense shells or other kind of inhomogeneities present in hot massive stars winds ( see , e.g. , @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "this implies that most of the x  ray emission in this time interval is scattered x  ray emission , which is less absorbed because mainly produced by less dense wind material located off the orbital plane and farther away from the companion star .",
    "this could explain why the observed column density in time interval n.  2 is not larger than in the remaining ( fully out - of - eclipse ) part of the orbit .",
    "the likely presence of large scale structures in the supergiant wind is also suggested by the orbital phase of the first flare , which is compatible ( within the uncertainties , see sect .",
    "[ sec : lc ] ) with the location along the orbit of other bright flares observed in the past in  ( @xmath37@xmath10.36 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests that the flares are triggered by a higher accretion rate during the passage inside a phase - locked denser wind component , like the one predicted by @xcite .",
    "this seems to be also indicated by the fact that , interestingly , the egress x  ray emission ( n.  2 ) ends with the sharp transition to the first x  ray flare ( see sect .  [ sec : lc ] ) .",
    "if this explanation is correct , after the first flare , the compact object lies in - between the observer and the dense wind structure , with the direct x ",
    "ray emission finally dominating the observed x ",
    "rays along the remaining part of the orbit .    the second flare , spaced by about 0.2 in phase , could be reconciled by the crossing of a similar wind component , if the orbit is eccentric ( as in the light curves simulated by @xcite ) , or by the compact object approaching the periastron passage .",
    "unfortunately , we lack any information about the other orbital parameters ( e.g. eccentricity ) to be able to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "the absorbing column density is always in excess of the interstellar reddening and does not show evidence for variability along the orbit ( if also the slope of the power - law is mantained free ) , except that during the eclipse . on the other hand ,",
    "if the power - law slope is fixed to the value of the average spectrum ( @xmath49=1.35 ) , variability is present , with more absorption during the low luminosity flares .",
    "the only known orbital parameter is the period of 3.32  days .",
    "we did not observe the eclipse ingress , so we can not constrain the companion radius , r@xmath62 . on the other hand , r@xmath62 can be estimated from the supergiant spectral type and requiring that the star does not overflow its roche lobe .",
    "the spectral type of the supergiant ( o8.5i or o9.5i ) suggests a mass in the range m@xmath62=3034  @xmath63 and a radius of 22 - 23  r@xmath16 @xcite .",
    "a further constraint on the stellar size comes from the fact that the companion should not overlflow its roche lobe radius @xcite .",

    "the average total intensity during the eclipse is about 5% of the out - of - eclipse , intra - flare x ",

    "given long - term monitoring performed with previous missions , this is very likely the most typical appearence of an orbital cycle in this sfxt ; * the absorbing column density does not show evidence for variability , within the uncertainties , except from during the x  ray eclipse ; * the remaining flux during the x  ray eclipse , produced by thomson scattering , allowed us to estimate the wind density at the orbital separation , resulting in @xmath9@xmath68=7@xmath1110@xmath12  g  @xmath13 ; * assuming a circular orbit and a spherical geometry for the supergiant wind , the derived wind density translates into a ratio @xmath1410@xmath15  m@xmath16/km . since the accretion luminosity implied by this ratio , assuming terminal velocities in the range 5003000  km  s@xmath17 , is at least two orders of magnitude higher than that observed ,",
    "we can conclude that a mechanism mediating the accretion onto the putative neutron star in the system is likely to be at work to reduce the mass accretion rate .",

    "<S> the source light curve displays variability of more than two orders of magnitude , starting with a very low emission state ( 10@xmath2  ; 110 kev ) lasting the first 46 ks , consistent with being due to the x  ray eclipse by the supergiant companion . </S>",

    "<S> remarkably , the first faint flare occurs at a similar orbital phase of the bright flares previously observed in the system . </S>",

    "<S> a narrow fe  k@xmath8 emission line at 6.4 kev is viewed along the whole orbit , with an intensity which correlates with the continuum emission above 7 kev . the scattered component visible during the x  ray eclipse allowed us to directly probe the wind density at the orbital separation , resulting in @xmath9@xmath10=7@xmath1110@xmath12  g  @xmath13 . assuming a spherical geometry for the supergiant wind </S>",
