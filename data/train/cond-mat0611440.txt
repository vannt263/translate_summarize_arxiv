    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the sliding friction of hard incommensurate crystals has stimulated for over a decade the study of non - linear classical dynamical systems  belonging to the class of generalized frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) models @xcite  which can show a rich variety of dynamical behavior , ranging from regular to chaotic motion @xcite .",
    "in particular , in presence of a uniform external driving , the length - scale competition between different spatial periodicities can give rise to intriguing frequency incommensurations and phase locking phenomena .",
    "in this paper we discuss and analyze in depth the striking exact velocity quantization phenomena recently reported in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) non - linear model inspired by the tribological problem of two sliding surfaces with a thin solid lubricant layer in between @xcite .",
    "the model `` layer '' consists here of a chain of @xmath4 harmonically interacting particles interposed between two rigid generally ( but not necessarily ) incommensurate sinusoidal substrates representing the two `` sliding crystals '' , sketched in fig .",

    "@xmath13 is a phenomenological parameter substituting for various sources of dissipation .",
    "dissipation is required to achieve a stationary state , but has otherwise no major role in the following .",
    "@xmath14 are the amplitudes of the forces representing the sinusoidal corrugation of the two sliders ( we will commonly use @xmath15 but we did check that our results are more general ) .",
    "we take @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 as our basic units , so that the natural units for all quantities used to characterize the model are listed in table  [ units : tab ] .",
    "the relevant length ratios @xcite are therefore @xmath19 ; we take , without loss of generality , @xmath20 . the inter - particle equilibrium length @xmath21 ,",
    "not entering explicitly the equation of motion ( [ eqmotion : eqn ] ) , appears via the boundary conditions , which are taken to be periodic ( pbc ) , @xmath22 , to enforce a fixed - density condition for the chain @xcite , with a _ coverage _",
    "@xmath23 of chain atoms on the `` denser '' substrate of periodicity @xmath1 .",
    "technically , the pbcs can be realized in two different manners .",
    "the first ( i ) is quite standard @xcite , and consists in approximating @xmath23 and @xmath24 with suitable rational numbers @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( with @xmath27 $ ] meaning the nearest - integer of @xmath28 ) .",
    "the second ( ii ) uses , instead , a finite @xmath4 and machine - precision values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for irrational @xmath23 and/or @xmath24 , both methods introduce a finite - size error @xmath29 in the relative phase of the three periodic objects involved in the model . in method ( i )",
    "this error is distributed uniformly through the chain , while in method ( ii ) it remains concentrated where the boundary condition applies , at sites @xmath30 and @xmath4 .",
    "for a generic @xmath4 , @xmath31 is of order unity , but , as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "model : fig]b ( reporting the @xmath4 values where @xmath31 is smaller than for any other @xmath32 ) , it can be made arbitrarily small by choosing suitably large integers @xmath33 . in both methods",
    "we obtain , as long as @xmath34 , fairly stable and consistent results , which converge to the same limit for large @xmath33 , where @xmath31 vanishes and full incommensurability is restored . in a @xmath35 scheme ,",
    "the speed of convergence depends crucially on the nature of the incommensurability of @xmath23 .",
    "quadratic irrational values of @xmath23 are , thanks to their _ periodic _ continued - fraction representation @xcite , especially advantageous and yield a rapidly vanishing phase error @xmath36 ( the example quadratic irrationals of fig .",

    "finally , for the class @xmath46)$ ] , with rational @xmath47 , the error decays rapidly @xmath36 , regardless of the irrational nature of @xmath23 .",
    "finite chains with open boundary conditions ( obc ) were also considered , with similar results briefly discussed below , and dealt with in greater detail in ref .",
    "similar models were considered in the past @xcite missing however the ingredient of incommensurability , which is important for the novel features shown here .",
    "a previous study of the present model @xcite achieved the sliding through application of a driving to one of the two substrates , via an _",
    "additional spring_. that procedure obscures the quantization phenomena which are instead uncovered when sliding occurs with a constant _ velocity _ @xmath5 .    upon sliding the substrates , @xmath48 , the lubricant chain slides too .",
    "however , it generally does so in a nontrivial manner : the time - averaged relative chain velocity @xmath49 , is generally _ asymmetric _ , namely different from 1/2 .",
    "even more surprisingly , @xmath50 is exactly _ quantized _ , for large parameter intervals , to plateau values that depend solely on the chosen commensurability ratios .",
    "the asymmetrical @xmath50-plateaus are generally very stable , and insensitive to many details of the model , indicating an intrinsically topological nature .",
    "we show that they are the manifestation of a certain density of topological solitons ( _ kinks _ ) in the lubricant versus the `` denser '' substrate potential with periodicity @xmath1 .",
    "these solitons are set into motion with the external driving velocity @xmath5 by the sliding `` sparser '' substrate with periodicity @xmath51 .",
    "we now turn to illustrating the results .",
    "we integrate the equations of motion ( [ eqmotion : eqn ] ) starting from fully relaxed springs ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) , by a standard fourth - order runge - kutta method . after an initial transient",
    ", the system reaches its dynamical stationary state , at least so long as @xmath13 is not exactly zero .",
    "figure  [ velcm : fig]a shows the resulting time - averaged center - of - mass ( cm ) velocity @xmath54 as a function of the chain stiffness @xmath8 for four representative @xmath55 values : three with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and one with @xmath58 .",
    "we find that @xmath49 is generally a complicated function of @xmath8 , with flat plateaus and regimes of continuous evolution , in a way which is qualitatively similar for different cases .",
    "the main surprise is that all plateaus show perfectly flat @xmath50 values , that are exactly constant ( quantized ) to all figures of numerical accuracy , the precise value strikingly independent of @xmath8 , of @xmath13 , of @xmath5 , and even of @xmath59 .    to explore the origin of the @xmath50 plateaus",
    ", we analyze the dynamics for a large number of values of @xmath55 , and observe that : ( i ) at least one velocity plateau as a function of @xmath8 occurs for a wide range of @xmath55 ; ( ii ) additional narrower secondary plateaus often arise for stiffer chain ( larger @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]a ) ; ( iii ) the velocity ratio @xmath50 of the main plateau  the first plateau found for increasing @xmath8  satisfies @xmath60 for a large range of @xmath55 , see fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]b .",
    "as sketched in our recent note @xcite , we can understand these results as follows .",
    "consider for illustration a situation of quasi - commensuration of the chain to the @xmath1 substrate : @xmath61 , with @xmath62 .",
    "the slight commensurability mismatch induces a density @xmath63 of solitons ( or kinks ) , essentially substrate minima holding two particles , rather than one @xcite .",
    "assume that the second , less oscillating @xmath51 slider , which moves at velocity @xmath5 , will _ drag _ the kinks along : @xmath64 .",
    "if @xmath65 is the linear density of lubricant particles , mass transport will obey @xmath66 .",
    "this yields precisely @xmath67 thus the quantized velocity plateaus appear to arise because the smoother slider ( whose exact period @xmath51 is irrelevant , but is the one further away from the chain s periodicity , @xmath20 ) drags the lattice of kinks , of fixed and given density , at its own full external speed @xmath5 , as illustrated fig .",
    "[ kinks : fig]a . as shown in fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]b , the physics of kink dragging is not limited to the quasi commensurate case @xmath62 , but extends to all values of @xmath68 , where individual kinks can hardly be singled out . amusingly , this mechanism also works for @xmath69 i.e.  @xmath58 . here",
    "kinks are replaced by anti - kinks , and we find that the chain moves in the _ opposite _ direction to the external driving @xmath5 ( @xmath70 , see fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]a for @xmath71 ) .",
    "exactly as holes in a semiconductor , anti - kinks ( carrying a negative `` charge '' ) dragged at velocity @xmath72 effectively produce a _ backward _ net motion of the lubricant layer .",
    "this `` upstream '' motion of the anti - kinks ( regions of increased inter - particle separation , and of decreased local particle density ) is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kinks : fig]b .    before moving on",
    ", we must explain what makes the chain select the substrate with which kinks are formed , as opposed to the other substrate merely acting as a moving brush dragging the kinks along .",
    "as it turns out , kinks are formed relative to the nearer - in - register substrate , which by construction has here the period @xmath1 .",
    "the density ( [ rhosol ] ) of kinks is such that they can be either commensurate or incommensurate relative to the periodicity @xmath51 of the second substrate .",
    "the soliton lattice is commensurate to the @xmath51 substrate whenever the ratio of @xmath51 to the average inter - kink distance @xmath73 is a rational number @xmath47 , i.e. when @xmath74 we find that this condition , for @xmath75 , is particularly beneficial to formation of a large and stable main plateau .",
    "indeed @xmath76 does satisfy eq .",
    "[ commensurate ] for @xmath75 , and its @xmath8-plateau covers almost three decades , as shown in fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig]a .",
    "we find similarly wide plateaus for @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "the motion of the individual particles is also very instructive .",
    "figure  [ evol : fig ] shows the time evolution of the velocity of a single chain particle @xmath81 , and of @xmath54 , for a value of @xmath8 inside a plateau , @xmath82 , for @xmath83 and @xmath78 of fig .  [ velcm : fig ] . here",
    "two clear kinds of behavior emerge .",
    "the single - particle motion of each particle in the chain is , during motion in the gm plateau , perfectly time - periodic .",
    "a similar periodic dynamics is found , in appropriate regimes , for all rational and _ quadratic _ irrational @xmath35 values which we tested .",
    "similarly , periodic motion emerges on the plateaus of @xmath55 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ commensurate ] ) , for arbitrary @xmath23 . on the contrary ,",
    "single - particle motion in the @xmath84 spiral mean ( sm ) case is definitely not periodic .",
    "the fourier spectrum of the particle motion , shown in fig .",
    "[ evol : fig]c , confirms that sm sliding yields only quasi - periodic orbits with two prominent incommensurate frequencies @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which can be interpreted as the average frequency of encounter of a generic particle with the two substrate periodic corrugations , @xmath87 and @xmath88 respectively .",
    "there is however a complete and exact phase cancellation between the fourier spectra of different chain particles ( all having the same amplitude spectrum , with different phases ) , giving rise to a strictly periodic motion of the chain cm even in the sm case .",
    "periodic cm velocity oscillations around an exactly quantized drift velocity is a common and generic feature of all plateaus in the chain dynamics .",
    "these periodic oscillations can be understood as the solitons moving at velocity @xmath5 encountering the periodic peierls - nabarro potential @xcite of period @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding frequency of encounter @xmath89 is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ evol : fig]d .",
    "we observe that the peierls - nabarro barrier vanishes ( yielding a strictly constant @xmath54 ) for all cases where the particle motion is periodic , particularly all @xmath55 satisfying eq .",
    "( [ commensurate ] ) .",
    "when such a periodic single - particle motion occurs for a @xmath51-commensurate soliton lattice , eq .",
    "( [ commensurate ] ) , the frequency ratio @xmath90 as this condition is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ commensurate ] ) , this analysis attributes to the rational @xmath47 the double significance of ( i ) the coverage fraction of solitons on the substrate of periodicity @xmath51 , and ( ii ) the ratio between the average frequencies @xmath85 and @xmath86 of encounter of the features of the two substrates .",
    "low driving velocities @xmath5 are beneficial to the appearance and to the width of velocity plateaus",
    ". for increasing @xmath5 , the plateaus shrink and eventually disappear , still remaining exact while they do so .",
    "the critical @xmath5 where the plateaus eventually disappear depends on @xmath8 , but is usually smaller than unity , for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig ] .",
    "fully commensurate @xmath75 plateaus such as that of the @xmath91 case are especially wide and robust against an increase of @xmath5 ( for the parameters of fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig ] and @xmath92 , up to @xmath93 ) and other perturbations . within the class of @xmath94 length ratios",
    ", @xmath83 appears therefore , in the present dynamical context , as the `` most _ commensurate _ '' irrational , at variance with static pinning in the standard fk model , where the opposite occurs @xcite .",
    "all the above is for pbc .",
    "as anticipated , obc simulations @xcite show however that the pbc used are not crucial to the plateau quantization , which occurs even for a lubricant `` patch '' of finite and not particularly large size @xmath4 , perhaps such as a hydrocarbon chain molecule would be in 1d , or an interposed graphite flake in two - dimensions ( 2d ) .",
    "the finite lubricant size does not remove the plateaus . on the contrary , it permits and favors the development of robust velocity plateaus as a function of stiffness . the plateau values are not identical to those of the infinite chain with pbcs .",
    "the reason for that is that finite size allows for an overall chain - length re - adjustment which spontaneously promotes single - particle _ periodic _ oscillations , effectively satisfying eq .",
    "( [ commensurate ] ) .",
    "returning to the general infinite chain case , the finding of exact plateaus implies a kind of `` dynamical incompressibility '' , namely identically null response to perturbations or fluctuations trying to deflect the cm velocity away from its quantized value . in order to probe the robustness of the plateau attractors",
    ", we can introduce an additional constant force @xmath95 acting on all particles in the chain , whose action is to try to alter the force - free sliding velocity away from its plateau value .",
    "as expected , as long as @xmath95 remains sufficiently small , it does perturb the single - particle motions but has no effect whatsoever on @xmath50 , which remains exactly pinned to the attractor ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "the plateau dynamics is only abandoned above a critical force @xmath97 .",
    "this dynamical depinning takes place through a series of type - i intermittencies @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ critical : fig]b where @xmath98 is plotted against a slow adiabatic ramping of @xmath95 .    a precise value of @xmath97 can be obtained by ramping @xmath95 with time with a gentle enough rate of increase or , alternatively , by a floquet - lyapunov linear stability analysis .",
    "this procedure is standard @xcite and amounts to studying the eigenvalues of a @xmath99 matrix @xmath100 whose columns are the linearized time - evolutions , over one period @xmath101 , of the standard basis vectors @xmath102 in phase - space .",
    "the motion is stable if the ( complex ) eigenvalues @xmath103 of @xmath100 are smaller than unity , @xmath104 ; intermittencies of type i arise when the largest ( in modulus ) eigenvalue of @xmath100 , @xmath105 , reaches the point @xmath30 in the complex plane , @xmath106 , which is indeed what we find at the edge of the gm plateau .",
    "the value of @xmath97 is a function of the parameters , and @xmath97 vanishes linearly when @xmath8 approaches the border @xmath107 of the plateau , as in fig .  [ critical : fig]a .",
    "the depinning transition line @xmath97 shows a jump @xmath108 in the average @xmath54 and a clear hysteretic behavior @xcite as @xmath95 crosses @xmath97 , for not too large values of @xmath109 .",
    "as can be expected , @xmath108 decreases to @xmath110 as @xmath8 increases .",
    "around @xmath111 the depinning transition is continuous .",
    "the specific point @xmath111 represents the zero-@xmath95 crossing of the depinning line , which extends to negative @xmath95 above @xmath107 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath107 depends on parameters such as @xmath5 and @xmath13 . as @xmath8 approaches @xmath107 from above ( no external force ) , @xmath54 approaches @xmath112 in a critical manner , as suggested in fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig](a ) .",
    "this is detailed in fig .",
    "[ critical : fig](c , d ) , where the critical behavior is shown to be @xmath113 , the value typical of intermittencies of type i @xcite . for @xmath114 , in fact the chain spends most of its time moving at @xmath115 , except for short bursts at regular time - intervals @xmath116 , where the system as a whole jumps ahead by @xmath21 , i.e.  an extra chain lattice spacing ( collective slip ) .",
    "the characteristic time @xmath116 between successive collective slips diverges as @xmath117 for @xmath118 , consistent with the critical behavior of @xmath50 .",
    "we verified that the @xmath50-plateaus for more general values of @xmath23 and of @xmath24 show the same kind of infinite stiffness , and a critical decrease of @xmath97 near the plateau edge , similar to that of fig .",
    "[ critical : fig]a for the gm .",
    "we have investigated the _",
    "tribological _ properties of the model in the plateau regime .",
    "as the dissipative term makes no work on particles that move at velocity @xmath119 , it is particularly convenient to evaluate the dissipated power in the `` symmetric '' frame of reference where the upper chain moves at velocity @xmath120 and the lower chain moves at velocity @xmath121 . in this frame of reference ,",
    "the instantaneous total power dissipated by the @xmath13 term amounts to @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the total kinetic energy of the particles in the symmetric frame of reference .",
    "this power fluctuates , but eventually , in the dynamical stationary state its average value @xmath124 equals on average the mean power necessary to maintain the motion of the sliders @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dissipation : fig ] shows the dissipated power per particle in a wide range of @xmath8 values for the @xmath91 model .",
    "it is apparent that the friction decreases as the springs become stiffer and stiffer , where fluctuations are of decreasing amplitude .",
    "the plateau region does not appear to be especially conspicuous in this frictional decrease , except for a net drop at the end of the plateau , due to the lubricant moving closer and closer to the symmetric velocity @xmath125 .",
    "the phenomena just described for a model 1d system might have 2d counterparts , potentially observable in real systems .",
    "nested carbon nanotubes @xcite , or confined one - dimensional nanomechanical systems @xcite , are one of several possible arenas for the phenomena described in this paper . though speculative at this stage ,",
    "an obvious question is what aspects of the phenomenology just described might survive in 2d , where tribological realizations , such as the sliding of two hard crystalline faces with , e.g. , an interposed graphite flake , are conceivable .",
    "our results suggests that the lattice of discommensurations  a moir pattern formed by the flake on a substrate , could be dragged by the other sliding crystal face , in such a manner that the speed of the flake as a whole would be smaller , and quantized . this would amount to the slider `` ironing '' the solitons onward .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated how incommensurability may lead to virtually friction - free sliding in such a case , but no measure was obtained for the flake relative sliding velocity . unlike our model , real substrates are not rigid nor ideal , but subject to thermal expansion and characterized by defects .",
    "nevertheless the ubiquity of plateaus shown in fig .",
    "[ velcm : fig ] , and their topological origin , suggests that these effects would not remove the phenomenon .",
    "a real - life situation with a distribution of differently oriented crystalline micro - grains , each possessing a different incommensurability , is also potentially interesting ; each grain , we expect , will tend to stabilize a certain average cm velocity depending on its incommensurability .",
