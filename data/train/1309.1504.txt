    "the theory of support varieties / schemes for an infinitesimal group scheme @xmath0 was established by suslin , friedlander , and bendel  @xcite in 1997 .",

    "the projective version , @xmath4 , of these support schemes provides a useful geometric setting on which the more general notion of local jordan type can be defined .",

    "information about the local jordan type of @xmath5 is reflected in the properties of these sheaves , most notably that modules of constant jordan type are those modules for which certain constructions produce exclusively vector bundles .",
    "moreover , one can even test if @xmath5 belongs to the often studied class of endotrivial modules , or whether @xmath5 has the equal images or equal kernels property introduced by carlson , friedlander , and pevtsova  @xcite , by testing whether certain sheaves produced from @xmath5 are locally free . in the current paper",
