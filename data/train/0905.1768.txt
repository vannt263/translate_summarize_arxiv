    "the mechanisms and principles of heterogeneous crystal nucleation and the subsequent microstructure formation are still far from being explored and understood @xcite .",
    "steering the nucleation behaviour has important implications relevant for protein crystallization @xcite and the formation of new glasses and metallic alloys @xcite .",
    "colloidal suspensions have been exploited as model systems for crystal nucleation @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is possible to watch crystal nucleation in real space by using confocal microscopy @xcite . in particular ,",
    "two - dimensional suspensions of superparamagnetic particles confined to the air - water - interface of a pending droplet @xcite can easily be controlled by an external magnetic field .",
    "this allows to tune the interparticle interactions and to quench the systems quickly into a supercooled state @xcite .",
    "the external field induces magnetic dipole moments in the particles @xcite .",
    "if the field direction is normal to the air - water interface , the resulting dipole moments are parallel and the interparticle pair potential is repulsive scaling with the inverse cube of the particle separation @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures of these superparamagnetic colloids are ideal model systems to study crystal nucleation @xcite , crystallization @xcite and glass formation @xcite in real - space .    in this paper , we consider a binary mixture of superparamagnetic particles both by real - space microscopy experiment and monte - carlo computer simulations of a binary dipole - dipole interaction model @xcite . in the simulations ,",
    "the interaction is modelled as a pairwise dipole - dipole repulsion . while the ratio of magnetic dipole moments fixed , the interaction strength governed by the external magnetic field and the relative composition is varied",
    "we compare the pair correlation functions for strong interactions ( i.e. for large external magnetic fields ) and find good agreement between experiment and simulations .",
    "moreover , we discuss the occurrence of peaks in the distance - resolved pair correlations in conjunction with local crystallites .",
    "the latter are patches of triangular and square ordering which are crystalline `` seeds '' in the amorphous fluid and building blocks from the globally stable crystalline structure @xcite .",
    "these crystallites actually could act as nucleation centers for homogeneous nucleation if the system is quenched deeply into the supercooled state @xcite .",
    "though heterogeneous nucleation is not tackled in the present paper , an understanding of the local crystallites in the bulk is a first necessary step in order to access possible pathways of inhomogeneous systems leading to heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "as regards to previous work , we here address strong couplings different from the weakly - coupled case where partial clustering of the small particles was found @xcite and equilibrated systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a quench was performed and the pair correlation functions were found to be widely different from their equilibration counterparts . for this genuinely non - equilibrium phenomenon , brownian dynamics computer simulations were employed .    the paper is organized as follows : in section ii briefly describe the experimental set - up and the simulation method . in section iii , results of experiment and computer simulations are presented and discussed . finally we conclude in section iv .",
    "the experimental system consists of a suspension of two kinds of spherical and super - paramagnetic colloidal particles .",
    "the two species are called @xmath0 and @xmath1 respectively with @xmath1 referring to the smaller particles .",
    "the hard - core diameters of the two species are @xmath2 , and @xmath3 and their magnetic susceptibilities are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the details of the experimental set - up are explained elsewhere @xcite . due to their high mass density ,",
    "the particles are confined by gravity to a flat water - air interface formed by a pending water drop .",
    "the droplet is suspended by surface tension in a top sealed cylindrical hole with a diameter of @xmath6 and a depth of @xmath7 of a glass plate .",
    "a coil produces a magnetic field @xmath8 perpendicular to the water - air interface which induces a magnetic moment ( i.e. , @xmath9 with @xmath10 ) in each particle .",
    "this leads to a repulsive dipole - dipole pair interaction @xcite . by microscopy",
    ", trajectories of all particles in the field of view can be recorded over several days providing sufficient phase space information .",
    "the ensemble can be considered as ideally two - dimensional as the thermally activated out of plane motion of the particles is in the range of a few nanometer .",
    "while temperature is fixed to room temperature the strength of the interparticle interactions is tunable by the external magnetic field strength .",
    "a second parameter which is varied is the relative composition or the mixing ratio of the particles , @xmath11      in our monte carlo computer simulations , we model the system in two spatial dimensions by a pairwise additive potential @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the distance between two particles . for this inverse power potential , at fixed composition @xmath14 , all static quantities depend solely on a dimensionless interaction strength - or coupling constant - @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the thermal energy and @xmath17 the average interparticle separation between @xmath0-particles @xcite .",
    "hence effective temperature corresponds to the inverse of the coupling @xmath18 , and the system is completely characterized by three parameters : 1 ) dipolar moment ( or susceptibility ) ratio @xmath19 2 ) the relative composition @xmath14 , and 3 ) the interaction strength @xmath18 .",
    "while we fix the former to @xmath20 , the coupling @xmath18 and the relative composition @xmath14 are varied .",
    "standard monte - carlo simulations were performed with @xmath21 @xmath0-particles and a corresponding number @xmath22 of @xmath1 particles determined by the prescribed relative composition @xmath14 .",
    "the particles are in a square box with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "typically @xmath23 monte carlo steps per particle are used for equilibration and statistics is gathered over additional @xmath24 monte carlo steps .",
    "we present our results for the two considered compositions @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "various coupling strengths @xmath18 are then investigated by ( i ) microstructural analysis and ( ii ) partial pair distribution functions . in both cases , real - space experiments and monte carlo computer simulations",

    "in conclusion we have put forward the idea that two - dimensional binary mixtures are excellent model systems for crystal nucleation as they are easily supercooled by increasing an applied external field and crystallize into a variety of crystal structures .",
    "as revealed by the excellent agreement in the pair correlation functions , the system can be modelled by a simple dipole - dipole interaction potential @xcite . the strongly interacting fluid bears some crystallites which were identified and could act as possible nucleation centers both for homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation .",
    "future investigations should consider the nucleation at fixed imposed nucleation seeds which was studied theoretically for one - component two - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "steering the nucleation and growth for binary systems is expected to be much richer since there are several competing crystalline structures .",
    "exploring more asymmetries in the magnetic moments is possible by exploiting nonlinear saturation effects in the magnetic susceptibility at high external magnetic fields .",
    "this is another parameter which is crucially determining the phase behaviour .",
    "finally , it might be interesting to use binary charged suspensions confined between charged glass plates @xcite as two - dimensional model system for crystal nucleation .",
    "the interactions are then well - approximated effective yukawa potentials @xcite where the screening length is steered by the salinity .",
    "again the ground state crystal structures show a wealth of possible crystals as recently revealed by lattice - sum calculations @xcite",
    ". therefore a rich scenario of crystal nucleation and growth phenomena are expected to occur here as well .",
    "another realization of dipolar mixtures in 2d are granular systems @xcite which show interesting 2d ordering effects @xcite .",
    "finally binary colloid mixtures with added nonadsorbing polymers will result in effective attractions and possibly liquid - gas phase separation @xcite .",
