    "in recent years , a new type of topological order  symmetry protected topological ( spt ) order @xcite has been proposed and intensively studied in interacting boson and fermion systems .",
    "2d and 3d topological insulators ( ti ) @xcite are the simplest examples of spt phases , which are protected by time reversal and charge conservation symmetries . although topological insulators were initially proposed and experimentally realized in ( almost ) non - interacting electron systems , very recent studies have established their existence and stability even in the presence of strong interactions by computing ( non - perturbative ) quantum anomaly on various manifolds @xcite . the first attempt to systematically understand spt phases in interacting systems",
    "was proposed in ref .  , which pointed out that the well known haldane chain @xcite is actually an spt phase !",
    "later , a systematic classification of spt phases for interacting bosonic systems in arbitrary dimension with an arbitrary global symmetry was achieved by using ( generalized ) group cohomology theory @xcite or cobordism theory @xcite , which essentially classifies the quantum anomalies associated with the corresponding global symmetries in interacting bosonic systems . in terms of physical picture ,",
    "it has been further pointed out that by gauging the global symmetry @xmath4 , different spt phases can be characterized by different types of braiding statistics of @xmath4-flux / flux lines in 2d/3d @xcite . moreover , anomalous surface topological order was also proposed as another very powerful way to identify and characterize different 3d spt phases in interacting boson and fermion systems @xcite .    from the quantum information perspective , ( intrinsic )",
    "topological phases are gapped quantum states that can be defined and classified by inequivalent class of ( finite depth ) local unitary ( lu ) transformations @xcite , which leads to the novel concept of long range entanglement .",
    "however , in contrast to those ( intrinsic ) topological phases , all spt phases can be adiabatically connected to a trivial disordered phase or an atomic insulator without symmetry protection .",
    "therefore , spt phases only contain short - range entanglement and they can be constructed by applying local unitary transformations on a trivial product state .",
    "in particular , ref .   introduced a systematic way to construct fixed point ground state wavefunction for bosonic spt phases on arbitrary triangulations in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it turns out that such a construction is fairly complete for bosonic spt phases protected by unitary symmetry group(up to 3d ) .",
    "so far the only known example beyond this construction is the so - called @xmath5 spt state @xcite protected by time reversal symmetry in 3d .",
    "later , it was shown that such an exotic bosonic spt state can be realized by walker - wang model @xcite .    nevertheless , the classification and systematic understanding of spt phases in interacting fermion systems are much more complicated .",
    "one obvious way with fruitful results is the study on reduction of the free - fermion classifications @xcite under the effect of interactions @xcite .",
    "however , these works miss those fermionic spt ( fspt ) phases that can not be realized in free fermion systems . a slightly generalized way to understand fspt in interacting fermion systems is to stack some additional bosonic spt states onto a free fermion spt state@xcite .",
    "for example , an arguable fairly complete classification of ti in interacting electron systems @xcite can be constructed in such a way .",
    "however , there is no natural reason to believe that all fspt phases in interacting systems can be realized by the above stacking constructions and counter examples can be constructed explicitly .",
    "moreover , it has also been shown that certain bosonic spt phases will become  trivial \" ( adiabatically connected to a product state ) @xcite when embedding into interacting fermion systems .",
    "apparently , the stacking construction can not explain all these subtle issues .",
    "therefore , a systematic understanding and construction of interacting fspt phases are very desired .    the first attempt to classify interacting fspt phases in general dimensions",
    "was proposed in ref .  , where a class of fspt phases was constructed systematically by generalizing the usual group cohomology theory into the so - called special group super - cohomology theory .",
    "however , it turns out that such a construction can not give rise to all fspt phases ( except in 1d , where the obtained classification of fspt phases perfectly agrees with previous results @xcite ) . on the other hand , quantum anomaly characterized by spin cobordism@xcite or invertable spin topological quantum field theory ( tqft)@xcite suggests a very rich world of fspt phases , though it is not clear how to construct these fspt states in an explicit and systematic way .",
    "alternatively , the idea of gauging fermion parity @xcite provides us another way to understand fspt . in 2d , fairly complete classification of fspt can be obtained in this way , which also agrees with the anomaly classification given by spin cobordism and invertable spin tqft @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the mathematical objects that classify 2d fspt phases with a total symmetry @xmath2 can be summarized as three group cohomologies of the symmetry group @xcite : @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . @xmath6 which one - to - one corresponds to the @xmath9 subgroups of @xmath3 , classifies fspt phases with majorana edge modes .",
    "@xmath7 , the obstruction free subgroup of @xmath10 is formed by elements @xmath11 that satisfy @xmath12 in @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the steenrod square @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "@xmath16 is the well - known classification of bosonic spt phases .",
    "physically , the @xmath6 layer can be constructed by decorating a majorana chain @xcite ( which is a 1d invertable fermionic tqft ) onto the domain walls of symmetry group @xmath3 and the @xmath7 layer can be constructed by decorating complex fermion ( which is a 0d invertable tqft ) onto the intersection points of @xmath3-symmetry domain walls .",
    "nevertheless , the decoration scheme could suffer from obstructions and only a subgroup @xmath7 classifies valid and inequivalent 2d fspt phases . in 3d ,",
    "a few interesting examples of spt phases are studied based on walker - wang model construction , e.g. , diii class topological superconductor @xcite . however",
    ", it is unclear how to construct all fspt phases by using walker - wang model .",
    "in fact , it is even unclear how to reproduce all the special group super - cohomology constructions in this way .",
    "very recently , some new interacting fspt phases beyond special group super - cohomology are formally proposed by using spin tqft @xcite ; however , there is still lacking of general principle and lattice model realizations .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to propose a general physical principle to obtain all fspt phases in 3d with total symmetry group @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the bosonic global symmetry and @xmath17 is the fermion parity conservation symmetry . in a previous work",
    ", it has been shown that in the presence of global symmetry , symmetry enriched topological ( set ) phases can be defined and classified by equivalent class of symmetric local unitary ( slu ) transformations @xcite .",
    "in particular , spt phases can be realized as a special class of set phases whose bulk excitations are trivial and can be adiabatically connected to a product state in the absence of global symmetry . in ref .",
    ", it has been shown that fermionic local unitary ( flu ) transformations can be used to define and classify ( intrinsic ) topological phases for interacting fermion systems . the fock space structure and fermion parity conservation symmetry of fermion systems",
    "can be naturally encoded into flu transformations .",
    "thus , it is not quite surprising that in the presence of global symmetry , we can just introduce the notion of fermionic symmetric local unitary ( fslu ) transformations to define and classify fermionic set ( fset ) phases in interacting fermion systems .",
    "similar to the bosonic case , fspt phases are special class of fset phases that have trivial bulk excitations and can be adiabatically connected to a product state in the absence of global symmetry . technically , we only need to enforce the support dimension of fslu transformations equal to one to classify fspt states .",
    "essentially , the novel concept of fslu transformation allows us to construct very general fixed point fspt states of 2d and 3d fspt phases .",
    "moreover , all these fixed point wavefucntions admit exact solvable parent hamiltonians consisting of commuting projectors on an arbitrary triangulation with an arbitrary branching structure",
    ". we will begin with the 2d case where the discrete spin structure can be implemented by kasteleyn orientation @xcite that allows us to decorate majorana chain onto @xmath3-symmetry domain walls @xcite .",
    "then we will show how to implement the discrete spin structure on a triangulation of 3d ( orientable ) spin manifold , which is a nontrivial generalization of kasteleyn orientation .",
    "the discrete spin structure allows us to decorate the majorana chain onto the intersection lines of @xmath3-symmetry domain walls in a self consistent and topological invariant way .",
    "the fundamental mathematical data describing such a decoration scheme belong to @xmath1 , subjected to an obstructions on @xmath18 .",
    "the obstruction can be understood by the following physical picture : since kasteleyn orientation is not always possible for a large loop ( the 3d discrete spin structure can be used to construct _ local _ kasteleyn orientation of small loops within a tetrahedron ) , a complex fermion decoration on the intersection points of @xmath3-symmetry domain walls is typically required and this is only possible when the @xmath18 obstruction vanishes .",
    "furthermore , another obstruction on @xmath19 will be generated by wavefunction renormalization to finally determine whether the entire decoration scheme of majoarana chain is valid or not for a fixed point wavefunction in 3d .",
    "the precise mathematical objects that classify 3d fspt phases with a total symmetry @xmath2 can also be summarized as three group cohomologies of the symmetry group : @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath20 , the obstruction free subgroup of @xmath23 , is formed by elements @xmath24 that simultaneously satisfy @xmath25 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is some unknown cohomology operation ( to the best of our knowledge ) that maps @xmath30 satisfying @xmath25 in @xmath31 into an element in @xmath32 $ ] .",
    "the explicit expression of @xmath29 is very complicated and will be computed in a physical way in section  [ sec:3d : fspt ] .",
    "@xmath21 , the obstruction free subgroup of @xmath33 is formed by elements @xmath34 that satisfy @xmath35 in @xmath13 .",
    "we note that @xmath21 and @xmath36 were derived in the special group super - cohomology classification .",
