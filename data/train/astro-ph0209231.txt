    "multiwavelength observations of flares from blazars , particularly in the @xmath9-ray domain , have convincingly demonstrated that the compact inner jets of blazars are effective accelerators of particles to very high energies @xcite .",
    "analyses of correlated x - ray and tev gamma - ray flares in bl lac objects lend support to leptonic models @xcite , which imply efficient acceleration of relativistic electrons in these sources , probably due to relativistic shocks .",
    "associated acceleration of hadrons is expected with at least the same efficiency as that of the leptons , except perhaps for electron - positron pair jet models where few hadrons are present .",
    "comparison of the radio lobe and inner jet powers indicates that jets are composed mainly of electrons and protons @xcite , so that a nonthermal hadronic component is expected .",
    "acceleration of hadrons in blazar jets could be directly confirmed with the detection of neutrinos , provided that there are significant interactions of accelerated hadrons with ambient material or photon fields .",
    "detectable synchrotron emission at tev energies could be radiated by ultrarelativistic protons and ions , but this requires extremely strong magnetic fields @xmath10 - 100 g in bl lac objects @xcite .",
    "all other observable consequences of hadron acceleration result from the same interactions that produce neutrinos . these include x - ray and gamma - ray production from secondary leptons and gamma rays formed in hadronic interactions and , as we show here , deposition of energy transported by the escaping neutral radiations far from the inner jet .",
    "models invoking interactions with ambient matter @xcite require mass - loaded jets .",
    "if the nuclear interaction energy - loss time scale @xmath11 is to be less than the variability time scale @xmath12 , then high plasma densities @xmath13 $ ] @xmath14 are required , where @xmath15 is the comoving thermal proton density , @xmath16 is the observed variability time scale in days , @xmath17 is the doppler factor , @xmath18 mb is the nuclear interaction cross section , and @xmath19 is the inelasticity .",
    "( henceforth primes denote quantities in the comoving frame . )",
    "such models would , however , be inefficient if the sources are to be optically thin , as is required for nonthermal x - ray escape . for thomson - thin jets ( @xmath20 ) , the nuclear interaction time scale @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the comoving blob radius , @xmath23 is the dynamical ( or light crossing ) time scale , and @xmath24 mb is the thomson cross sections .",
    "thus protons can only lose @xmath25 - 3% of their energy on the dynamical time scale .",
    "moreover , as shown in appendix a , nuclear @xmath26 interaction models require large masses and kinetic energies .",
    "a second group of hadronic models is based upon photomeson interactions of relativistic hadrons with ambient photon fields in the jet .",
    "most of the models of this type take into account collisions of high - energy protons with the internal synchrotron photons @xcite , while others also take into account external radiation that originates either directly from the accretion disk @xcite or from disk radiation that is scattered by surrounding clouds to form a quasi - isotropic radiation field @xcite .",
    "bl lac objects have weak emission lines , so in these sources the dominant soft photon field is thought to be the internal synchrotron emission .",
    "strong optical emission lines from the illumination of broad - line region ( blr ) clouds in flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) reveal bright accretion - disk and scattered disk radiation in the inner regions @xcite .",
    "in the case of internal synchrotron radiation , the energy output of secondary particles formed in photohadronic processes is generally peaked in the energy range from @xmath27-@xmath28 ev in either low- or high - frequency peaked bl lac objects @xcite , which implies that such models can only be efficient if protons are accelerated to even higher energies .",
    "this demand upon proton acceleration for efficient photomeson production on the _ internal _ synchrotron photons also holds in fsrqs , which have similar nonthermal soft radiation spectra as low - frequency peaked bl lac objects . as shown by @xcite , however , the presence of the isotropic external radiation field in the vicinity of the jets of fsrqs strongly improves the photomeson production efficiency and relaxes the very high minimum proton energies needed for efficient production of secondaries .",
    "the existence of a strong external radiation field is required to explain @xcite the luminous 100mev - gev gamma - ray emission observed with the egret instrument on the _ compton gamma ray observatory _ @xcite .    in the model of @xcite",
    ", protons are assumed to be accelerated in an outflowing plasma blob moving with bulk lorentz factor @xmath5 along the symmetry axis of the accretion - disk / jet system .",
    "the relativistic protons are assumed to have an isotropic pitch - angle distribution in the comoving frame of a plasma blob , within which is entrained a tangled magnetic field . in our study , we determined the intensity of the internal radiation fields based on observations of 3c 279 during the flaring state in 1996 @xcite , and calculated the high - energy neutrino flux expected under the assumption that the power to accelerate relativistic protons was equal to the power injected into nonthermal electrons which explains the observed gamma - ray emission .",
    "the presence of a quasi - isotropic external radiation field enhances the neutrino detection rate by an order - of - magnitude or more over the case where the field is absent , so we predict that fsrqs can be detected with km - scale neutrino detectors , whereas bl lac objects are not as promising for neutrino detection .",
    "the model also takes into account the effects of relativistic neutron production , which can escape from the blob unless they are converted back to protons due to decay or further photohadronic collisions inside the blob .    in this paper",
    ", we further develop this model .",
    "details of the theory are presented that describe the evolution of relativistic protons , taking into account photohadronic energy losses and neutron escape from the relativistically moving blob .",
    "production of neutrons has been considered earlier in the stationary cores of agns @xcite , though not in the context of a jet model .",
    "the neutrons escaping from a relativistic blob form a beam with opening angle @xmath29 .",
    "these neutrons are subject to decay and further photohadronic interactions while passing through the quasi - isotropic external radiation field on the parsec scale , which we associate with the broad emission - line region ( blr ) .",
    "ultra - high energy gamma rays produced from the decay of secondary pions outside the blob can escape the blr because they are no longer subject to strong @xmath30 interactions with the synchrotron photons inside the blob when they are at a distance of a few @xmath31 from the blob .",
    "this results in a neutral beam of ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrons and gamma rays that can transport the energy to large distances from the central engine without significant interactions with the ambient medium until the neutrons decay or gamma rays are converted to electron - positron pairs through pair attenuation with diffuse radiation fields .",
    "this scenario naturally explains the appearance of large - scale jets that are colinear with the inner jets and appear straight on scales of hundreds of kpc .",
    "we also consider whether the different morphologies of fri and frii radio galaxies are a consequence of the different neutral beam properties formed in bl lac objects and fsrqs .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the model , our treatment of photomeson production and the energy spectra of secondaries , and our method to estimate the radiation and magnetic fields in the blob .",
    "the results of the calculations are presented in section 3 , and a discussion and summary are given in section 4 . a comparison of neutrino production through photomeson @xmath32 and nuclear @xmath33 interactions in jets",
    "is given in appendix a , and the conditions when the direct accretion - disk radiation field is less important than the scattered radiation field are derived in appendix b.",
    "here we consider the production of secondaries formed through photomeson interactions between relativistic protons and photons of both the internal synchrotron and the external scattered accretion - disk radiation fields .",
    "the scattered accretion - disk field is more important than the direct accretion disk radiation field when the blob is at a distance of hundreds of schwarzschild radii from the central engine because , unlike the case for compton scattering , the low - energy threshold for the photomeson process requires higher energy photons in the rest frame of the proton .",
    "the effects of directionality from photons originating from the accretion disk make this component less important for photomeson production than the scattered radiation field .",
    "the energy threshold is difficult to satisfy for photons originating from the luminous central regions of the accretion disk , which enter the plasma blob in a tail - on geometry .",
    "the accretion disk photons that enter from moderate angles originate from cooler portions of the disk at large disk radii , so that higher energy protons are required to exceed the photomeson threshold energy @xcite . a quantitative estimate of the relative importance of the direct and scattered radiation fields is derived in appendix b.    for an isotropic spatial distribution of ultrarelativistic neutrons in the frame of a blob moving with lorentz factor @xmath34 , the pattern of escaping neutrons in the stationary frame is beamed with a characteristic opening angle @xmath35 .",
    "the beaming of energetic neutrons would become even more pronounced when one takes into account that the angular distribution of external radiation is highly beamed in the direction opposite to the jet in the blob frame .",
    "for isotropic protons , this will give significant preference to head - on @xmath32 collisions of the protons in the direction of the jet rather than in the opposite direction .",
    "therefore , similar to the case of compton scattering @xcite , though possibly even more pronounced due to threshold effects , the external radiation field will cause a significant directional enhancement of the high - energy neutral beams in the jet direction already in the comoving frame .",
    "the neglect of this effect does not change , however , the mean energy - loss rate of protons in the blob , which are assumed to be isotropically distributed .",
    "it will have a noticeable impact only on the angular distribution of secondaries in near - threshold interactions .",
    "we have therefore neglected this effect in the paper , and a precise treatment of this effect is deferred to later work .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we present our method of calculations of photomeson and neutron production , proton energy - loss time scales and the relevant radiation fields , and spectra of secondary leptons , gamma rays , and neutrinos resulting from the decay of pions . following this ,",
    "we describe how the target photon fields are derived .",
    "we then present our treatment of proton evolution using a continuity - equation approach , and develop a theory for the neutron escape and subsequent neutron and @xmath9-ray interactions outside the plasma blob .",
    "photomeson interactions of relativistic protons with photons of the ambient radiation field produce secondary electrons and positrons ( referred to henceforth as electrons , unless the distinction is necessary ) , gamma rays , and neutrinos primarily through the production and decay of pions .",
    "the relevant decay chains are @xmath36 , and @xmath37 ( we do not distinguish between @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "it is important that in about half of these inelastic collisions , the primary relativistic proton will be converted to a relativistic neutron .",
    "this is true for the single - pion production channel @xmath40 , which has approximately the same cross section as the channel @xmath41 without neutron production , as well as for multipion production channels .",
    "energy losses of relativistic protons ( and neutrons ) are calculated on the basis of standard expressions ( e.g. , @xcite ) for the cooling time of relativistic protons , @xmath42 , due to photopion production in @xmath32 collisions .",
    "if the ambient photons have spectral density @xmath43 in the direction @xmath44 , then the cooling time of a proton in the direction @xmath45 is equal to @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the photon energy in the rest frame of the proton , @xmath48 , @xmath49c , and @xmath50 are the proton s lorentz factor , speed , and collision angle with the photon , respectively , and @xmath51 is the inelasticity of the interaction .",
    "the threshold photon energy for pion production in @xmath32 and @xmath52 reactions in the rest frame of the incident nucleon is @xmath53 .",
    "this means that protons with , say , 1 pev energy will effectively interact with soft x - ray photons with energy @xmath54 kev .    in the case of an isotropic photon distribution where @xmath55 , equation ( [ tpgamma ] ) reduces to the form @xmath56 @xcite . the @xmath32 collision rate @xmath57 is given by a similar expression as equations ( [ tpgamma ] ) or ( [ tpgiso ] ) , but with the inelasticity coefficient @xmath58 being dropped from the integral . the mean inelasticity @xmath59 $ ] .    a detailed recent study of this photohadronic process is given by @xcite",
    ". to simplify calculations , we approximate @xmath60 as a sum of 2 step - functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 for the single - pion and multi - pion production channels , respectively , with @xmath63 for @xmath64 and @xmath65 outside this region , whereas @xmath66 at @xmath67 .",
    "the inelasticity in the single pion channel is approximated as @xmath68 , whereas @xmath69 for energies above 500 mev .",
    "our treatment gives energy - loss pathlengths of 154 , 22.0 , and 14.1 mpc for the photomeson interactions of ultra - relativistic protons at energies of @xmath70 , 3@xmath71 , and @xmath72 ev , respectively , with the cosmic microwave background radiation field .",
    "these values are within 2% of the values calculated by @xcite .",
    "even at 7@xmath73 ev , where the interactions occur with the exponential wien tale of the blackbody spectrum , our treatment gives an energy - loss pathlength of 650 mpc , which is within 10% of the more accurate values calculated by @xcite .",
    "this approach also works well , within a few percent , for a broad power - law distribution of field photons @xmath74 for different spectral indices @xmath75 , and readily explains the significant increase in the mean inelasticity of incident protons ( or neutrons ) from @xmath76 for steep photon spectra with @xmath77 , to @xmath78 for hard spectra with @xmath79 , giving results in good agreement with the treatment of @xcite .",
    "the spectra of secondary @xmath80-decay particles ( @xmath81 ) are calculated in the @xmath17-function approximation for the energies of the secondaries .",
    "to correctly apply the @xmath17-function approximation , one has to properly take into account the different inelasticities of the single - pion and multi - pion production channels . in the single - pion production channel ,",
    "the probability for the conversion of a proton to a neutron with the emission of a @xmath82-meson is given by @xmath83 .",
    "given that the mean energies @xmath84 and @xmath85 of secondary electrons and neutrinos , respectively , are approximately the same , and that the @xmath82 takes on average @xmath86 of the initial proton energy @xmath87 , we have that @xmath88 . in the single - pion channel ,",
    "a @xmath89-meson is produced with the probability @xmath90 , which results in two gamma - rays each with mean energy @xmath91 after the @xmath89 decay .    in the multi - pion channel",
    ", we treat the coefficient of the inelasticity @xmath92 as a result of the production of three leading high - energy pions , equally distributed between @xmath82 , @xmath93 , and @xmath89 mesons , which becomes increasingly valid in the limit of large multiplicities .",
    "these three leading pions are assumed to take most of the energy lost by the primary proton , so that the remaining pions take away a negligible fraction of the initial energy . in this case , the mean energy carried by each pion is equal to @xmath94 , and the mean energies carried by the secondary electrons , neutrinos , and gamma rays are the same as in the single - pion channels .",
    "the production spectra of the secondaries can now be found in the @xmath17-function approximation for the differential cross sections for parent pion production , given the mean numbers of pions produced per @xmath32 interaction .",
    "the mean inelasticity @xmath95 for photomeson interactions of a proton with energy @xmath87 depends on the interaction probabilities @xmath96 and @xmath97 of the proton with the given photon field via single - pion or multi - pion channels , respectively .",

    "we thus have @xmath100 , and for the mean total number of charged pions @xmath101 .",
    "taking further into account that 2 @xmath9-rays are produced in @xmath89 decay , and that 3 neutrinos and 1 electron are produced in the decay of every charged pion , we arrive at the following formulae for the production spectra @xmath102 of gamma rays , electrons and neutrinos , given by @xmath103 @xmath104 the production spectrum of neutrinos @xmath105 , with @xmath106 .",

    "the electrons may be deflected by the magnetic field in the blr to produce synchrotron or compton - scattered radiation , but we do not consider this emission further here because the fluxes will depend significantly on unknown properties of the medium outside the jet , such as the magnetic field strength and geometry .",

    "figure 3 shows the fluences of neutrinos integrated over several days in the observer frame determined by the time for the blob to pass through the blr , for the same parameters as used in figure 1 .",
    "the solid and dashed curves show the fluences calculated for @xmath261 and 10 , respectively .",

    "as previously noted @xcite , the presence of external radiation fields is crucial for prospects to detect neutrinos from blazars with high - energy neutrino telescopes .    in order to understand how the production of neutrons will change when the inner jet expands , we show in figures 4a and 4b the spectra of protons and escaping neutrons and gamma rays , as in figure 1 , but calculated for different sizes of the blob corresponding to @xmath290 and 3 days , with @xmath262 .",
    "here we have fixed the external radiation field density and size of the blr ( @xmath291 pc ) to the values derived in figure 1b for @xmath262 .",
    "moreover , we assume that the acceleration rate of protons is such that the same amount of total energy as in figure 1 is injected in the protons continuously during the entire period that the jet travels through the blr .",
    "the fractional energy taken away by neutrons from the compact blob and from the blr is @xmath292 and @xmath293 , respectively , for @xmath290 d. in the case of the inflated blob with @xmath294 d , these fractions drop down correspondingly to @xmath295% and @xmath296% .    in figure 5",
    "we show the radiation fluxes produced in and escaping from the blob following the electromagnetic cascade initiated by energetic pion - decay electrons and gamma rays for the case @xmath262 .",
    "figure 5a shows the cascade radiation spectra at the maximum , which is reached at time @xmath297 when the injection of newly accelerated protons in the blob stops .",
    "figure 5b shows the radiation fluxes at the time when the blob is leaving the external radiation field region .",
    "the thick and thin curves correspond to synchrotron and compton - scattered radiation , respectively .",
    "the radiation of the first generation of electrons , which includes both the electrons from @xmath298 decays and the electrons produced by absorption of @xmath89-decay gamma rays in the blob , are shown by the solid curves .",
    "the synchrotron radiation strongly dominates the compton - scattered emission in the first generation because the electrons of the first generation are ultra - relativistic , such that compton scattering is in the extreme klein - nishina regime .",
    "the second , third , and fourth generations of the cascade radiation are shown by the dashed , dot - dashed , and triple - dot dashed curves , respectively . in the calculations of the escaping cascade radiation spectrum ,",
    "we have not considered the emission from electrons which are produced outside the blob .",
    "these electrons become isotropized and produce much weaker observed fluxes than the doppler - boosted emission produced in the blob .",
    "most of the @xmath299 opacity is due to the external radiation field above several gev ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "thus the spectra of different generations of cascade radiation escaping the blr are cut off at nearly the same energy as long as the blob is in the blr . at the same time",
    ", the cascade radiation made when the blob is outside the blr can extend to higher energies .    the heavy dots show the total spectrum .",
    "as can be seen in figure 5 , emission near 1 gev can escape from the blob and blr .",
    "these figures show that in both cases the main contribution to the resulting gamma - ray flux is due to synchrotron radiation of the first generation of the cascade electrons born mostly with energies above @xmath300 .",
    "noticeable gamma - ray fluxes may also be produced by secondaries from @xmath32 interactions in the blob at later stages when the blob is still within the blr , as seen in figure 5b .",
    "one may also expect that @xmath301gev gamma - ray photons produced at these later stages can be due to the escaping neutrons interacting with the uv photons outside of the blr .",
    "bl lac objects have generally lower luminosity than fsrqs and have weak or absent line emission , suggesting that the column density of the gas in the central parsec region is smaller .",
    "this may be due to a reduction in the fueling rate as the surrounding gas accretes onto the central engine @xcite .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then the mean black hole masses in bl lac objects should be even greater than in fsrqs .",
    "consequently , the maximum temperature of the disk in a bl lac object should be significantly lower than in fsrqs ( recall that @xmath302 , where @xmath303 is the eddington luminosity and @xmath304 is the mass accretion rate ; see dermer & schlickeiser 2002 ) .",
    "in our calculations , we take @xmath305for bl lac objects .",
    "we consider mrk 501 , a high - frequency peaked bl lac object that has been observed at tev energies , as representative of this class of sources .",
    "mrk 501 has a dshift @xmath306 , so that @xmath307 mpc .",
    "variability has been detected on time scales as short as 1 hour , although variability on time scales of order 1 day are also common .",
    "we therefore consider both @xmath308 and 1 day @xcite . for the compact jet with @xmath308 d , we approximate the flux density using the april 16th , 1997 flare data @xcite , with indices @xmath232 at frequencies @xmath309 , and @xmath310 at @xmath311 , and assuming a very steep cutoff above @xmath312 .",
    "the maximum @xmath108 flux is at the level of @xmath313 ergs @xmath110 s@xmath111 . for the ` quiescent ' state with @xmath314 = 1 day , which may correspond to a less powerful but continuous jet , we approximate the spectral fluxes with the same power - law indices @xmath75 , but with break frequencies @xmath315 hz and @xmath316 hz , and a maximum @xmath108 flux at the level of @xmath317 ergs @xmath110 s@xmath111 .    figure 6 shows the total energy spectrum of injected protons and protons remaining in the blob at the time when the jet is at a distance @xmath318 pc , which we assume to be the effective radius of the region where there is an isotropic scattered radiation field . in this calculation",
    ", we treat the @xmath319 d case , and let @xmath320 .",
    "this results in an equipartition magnetic field @xmath321 , and a maximum energy of accelerated protons equal to @xmath322ev in the comoving frame , which is larger by a factor @xmath323 in the stationary frame . for the external field , we assume that the maximum flux of the disk radiation can not exceed the flux of @xmath324 ergs @xmath110 s@xmath111 observed in the optical / uv range .",
    "the intensity of the isotropic radiation field is calculated assuming @xmath325 . for these parameters of external radiation - field",
    ", there is essentially no photomeson production by neutrons outside the blob , and consequently very low gamma - ray production outside the blob ( dot - dashed curve ) .",
    "the production of high - energy neutrons inside the blob through photomeson interactions with the internal synchrotron photons is still very effective for the highest energy protons with @xmath326ev .",
    "the fraction @xmath327 , and practically all of this neutron energy is carried from the supposed isotropic external radoiation to kpc scales .",
    "the maximum energy of protons is , however , smaller compared with the @xmath262 case for 3c 279 ( figure 1 ) , which implies a shorter propagation distance for the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutron beam .",
    "the power deposited in the neutron beam during the flare is @xmath328 orders of magnitude smaller than the power of neutrons escaping the blr in figure 1 .",
    "moreover , for larger doppler factors , @xmath329 - 45 , which are implied by the modeling of tev and x - ray flares @xcite , the power in neutrons would decrease further .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath330 and @xmath331 ergs for @xmath262 and 25 , respectively .",
    "note that the fraction of energy carried by @xmath332 gamma - rays produced by neutrons escaping the blob in the isotropic external radiation region in figure 1 is absolutely negligible , @xmath333    in figure 7 , we show the fluxes calculated for the case @xmath334d , assuming @xmath335 .",
    "figure 7a is calculated for @xmath336 g , corresponding to equipartition as defined in equation ( [ beq ] ) , whereas figure 7b assumes @xmath337 .",
    "the latter case may be of interest because the spectral fits for the 16 april 1997 flare in mrk 501 seem to require fields well below equipartition .",
    "the maximum energies of accelerated protons in the stationary frame are then @xmath338 ev and @xmath339gev in figures 7a and 7b , respectively , so that the effective maximum energy of the neutrons escaping the inner jet ( and therefore also the weak external radiation field ) does not significantly exceed @xmath340 , as seen in figure 7 .",
    "this suggests that in bl lac objects , the transport of energy by ultra relativistic neutrons is still possible , but the maximum distances for energy transport by the neutrons will be significantly shorter than in fsrqs .",
    "note also that the number of neutrinos to be expected by a km - scale neutrino detector in these two cases is extremely low , being less than @xmath341 in both figures 7a and 7b .",
    "observations of powerful gamma - ray flares from blazars with egret and ground - based gamma - ray telescopes have confirmed that radio - loud agns accelerate particles to gev and tev energies , respectively .",
    "particle acceleration to higher energies may occur , but this can not be established through gamma - ray observations because of attenuation by ambient and diffuse extragalactic optical and infrared radiation fields .",
    "although leptonic models have been successful in fitting the spectra of blazars , models of first - order fermi acceleration at both nonrelativistic and relativistic shocks imply that acceleration proceeds more effectively for protons than for electrons , because the larmor radius of a particle involved into the acceleration process must be larger than the shock width , which is more easily satisfied by hadrons @xcite .",
    "the large proton - to - electron ratio in the galactic cosmic rays supports this contention .",
    "thus our underlying assumption that protons are injected with at least the same power as inferred from the measured gamma - ray luminosity of a blazar seems reasonable .",
    "evidence for the acceleration of relativistic protons and heavier nuclei in blazar jets can be provided by three lines of evidence as described in the following subsections .",
    "first , hadronic acceleration could be established indirectly by detection of spectral features in the electromagnetic radiation produced by secondaries of the inelastic interactions of high - energy hadrons in blazar jets .",
    "the second and most compelling line of evidence will be provided through the direct detection of high - energy neutrinos by km - scale detectors such as icecube .",
    "the third line of evidence involves consequences of the production of uhe neutrons and gamma - rays which transport significant amounts of energy from the central region of an agn to large distances @xcite .",
    "this last feature is sufficiently interesting that we devote a separate subsection to applying this model to explain observed features of radio - loud agns .",
    "finally we summarize , considering also the possibility that ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are accelerated in the inner jets of blazars .      discriminating between hadronic and leptonic origins of",
    "the gamma radiation from blazars or other classes of sources is possible , although not an easy or a straightforward task . if the emission has a hadronic origin , then the emerging gamma - ray spectrum results from a cascade induced by high - energy secondary leptons and gamma - rays .",
    "photon spectral indices from cascade radiation tend to be rather hard , and take values between 1.5 and 2.0 in the medium - energy gamma - ray regime explored by egret and _ glast _ ( see figure 5 ) .",
    "but this is also a common feature for gamma - ray spectra from an electron - photon cascade independently of whether the cascade is initiated by electrons and gamma - rays of secondary ( pion - decay ) origin or by primary ( directly - accelerated ) electrons .",
    "a principal difference between the hadronic and leptonic induced cascades does , however , exist .",
    "it consists in a very significant contribution of the synchrotron radiation by the ultra - relativistic electrons ( including the ones from the absorption of @xmath89-decay gamma - rays ) of the first cascade generation in the high energy gamma - ray flux in the case of hadronic initiation of the cascade .",
    "the lorentz factor of these electrons @xmath342 is much higher than the maximum possible lorentz factor for primary electrons , which is limited by synchrotron losses in the strong magnetic fields @xmath343-@xmath344 characteristic for the inner jets of blazars . as a result",
    ", the synchrotron radiation of these electrons can greatly exceed the characteristic maximum energy @xmath345 - 100 mev @xcite for synchrotron emission of directly accelerated electrons , as is apparent from figure 5 . additionally taking into account the doppler boosting of the energy @xmath346 when transforming to the observer s frame",
    ", we can say that confirmation of a significant contribution of hard - spectrum synchrotron flux in the gamma - ray flares at @xmath347 with _ glast _ could become a strong argument in favor of uhe hadron acceleration in the jets .",
    "a synchrotron contribution could be confirmed experimentally by the detection of a significant polarization in the total flux , but neither glast nor other high energy gamma - ray detectors yet have the capability for the relevant measurements .",
    "it is possible that the synchrotron origin of the gev radiation could be revealed by accurate modeling of the spectral and temporal behaviors of the broad - band gamma ray fluxes detected by glast , as well as by forthcoming ground - based cherenkov detectors .",
    "of particular interest in this regard could be the interpretation of flares which would _ decline _ rapidly at 0.1 - 1 gev energies at the flare fading stage .",
    "the key observation here is that in fsrqs , the compton radiation at these energies should be due to upscattering of external uv photons by electrons with @xmath348 , which could have cooling times larger than the measured decline time , whereas the gev synchrotron radiation is due to electrons with many orders of magnitude higher energies , and so it would have much shorter cooling times .",
    "if radio galaxies are misdirected blazars and steep spectrum radio sources are off - axis fsrqs @xcite , then the gamma - ray spectra of radio galaxies could also reveal hadronic acceleration in blazar jets .",
    "nonthermal cosmic rays that escape from the inner jets of radio galaxies can accumulate in the central gas - rich region of the agn .",
    "nuclear collisions of these cosmic rays with ambient gas would produce a quasi - stationary ( on time scales of thousands of years ) and compact gamma - ray halo with a characteristic @xmath89-decay feature near 70/(1+z ) mev .",
    "note however that the bremsstrahlung emission from @xmath298-decay electrons of @xmath3490.1 - 1 gev energies is likely to conceal the 70 mev benchmark @xcite .",
    "nuclear interactions will give secondary @xmath350-decay emission that is brightest in the central blr core of a radio galaxy where the target particle density is highest , and dimmer in the extended region due to the tenuousness of the interstellar medium on scales of hundreds of pc .",
    "because of the rather small size of this hadronic halo , the gamma - ray detectors would detect it as a point source .",
    "such a compact hadronic halo could be still resolved in the radio band , where the radio flux produced by secondary electrons of gev energies would show an increase in brightness towards the center of the agn on the milliarcsecond scale .",
    "note that at very high energies , a halo on the much larger scale ( multi - megaparsec ) could be formed around such sources due to absorption and cascading of multi - tev gamma - rays in the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "considering possible signatures of relativistic hadrons during the flares , we note that a pronounced 70 mev @xmath89-decay maximum should be due first of all to hadrons with kinetic energies @xmath351 - 10gev ; therefore it would imply a mass - loaded jet .",
    "as we show in the appendix a , the mass - loaded jet models are rather unlikely because they confront severe energetics difficulties . nevertheless , the hadronic @xmath89-decay gamma - ray feature , although significantly broadened and doppler - shifted , could be expected in those particular cases when the inner jet dumps its energy in collisions with the dense target , such as a broad line cloud crossing the jet .",
    "observations of radio galaxies with imaging x - ray telescopes , _",
    "glast _ , and ground - based air cherenkov telescopes with low energy thresholds will provide spectral data that should be analyzed for evidence of nonthermal hadrons in light of these considerations .",
    "detection of neutrinos from blazars will provide the most compelling evidence for hadronic acceleration in blazar jets . for photohadronic jet models ,",
    "we have argued here and elsewhere @xcite that the presence of a strong uv accretion - disk radiation field is required for blazar neutrino fluxes to be detectable with km - scale high - energy neutrino telescopes . the disk radiation field is needed to produce a quasi - isotropic scattered radiation component produced in the blr of fsrqs .",
    "the existence of an external radiation field in fsrqs is suggested by luminous broad emission lines detected from these objects . for uv fields expected from optically - thick accretion disks",
    ", photomeson interactions can efficiently extract the energy of relativistic protons with ( relatively modest ) energies @xmath352 , resulting in the production of neutrinos with @xmath353 . for flares like the one detected in february 1996 from 3c 279 with egret ,",
    "the fluence of neutrinos shown in figure 3 is at the level of @xmath354 , implying @xmath355 per flare ( i.e. , a detection probability of @xmath356 ) .",
    "this would suggest a realistic possibility for icecube to detect a few to several neutrinos from several flares over the course of a year .",
    "given the flaring duty cycle of fsrqs estimated from egret observations ( @xmath285 - 20% ) , this implies that a few high - energy neutrinos will be detected from fsrqs such as 3c 279 on a time scale of 1 year .",
    "considerably more will be detected if the efficiency to accelerate hadrons exceeds our baseline assumption given by equating proton and gamma - ray power .",
    "the additional possibility that some neutrinos will also be detected during quiescent states strengthens our prediction that fsrqs will be detectable high - energy neutrino sources with km - scale neutrino telescopes .",
    "we note that on a 1 year observation time scale , detection of only two neutrinos with energies above 30 tev from the same direction pointed to a known blazar would represent a very significant detection of an astrophysical source , because at these energies the background cosmic - ray induced neutrino flux expected within one square degree ( which is typical for the angular resolution of a high - energy neutrino telescope in ice or water ) is @xmath357 @xcite .",
    "for bl lac objects , where the accretion - disk and scattered radiation components are much weaker , and with gev gamma - ray fluxes that are also typically not as bright as in fsrqs , the chances for detection of neutrinos even with a 1 km - scale neutrino detector are negligible . for the proton",
    "fluxes shown in figures  6 and 7 calculated for parameters of the april 1997 flare in mrk 501 , the probability of neutrino detection during the flare is less than @xmath341 .",
    "it is also important to note that unlike the case of @xmath32 interactions with the internal synchrotron photons , the intensity of @xmath32 interactions with the external radiation does not depend on the blob size .",
    "therefore in fsrqs the neutrino production from photomeson interactions with the external radiation field does not decline so much in the process of expansion of the blob as it propagates through the quasi - isotropic external radiation field at @xmath358 as it does in bl lac objects .",
    "we note that the blob expansion seems unavoidable because of the difficulty in confining the high internal pressures of the blob by the pressure of the external medium .",
    "an important issue concerns the quenching of the jet as it sweeps up mass from the blr . as blr clouds",
    "execute keplerian rotational motion about the central supermassive black hole , some will pass through the path of the jet outflow .",
    "this will cause energization and deceleration of the radiating plasma , as in the external shock model of gamma - ray bursts @xcite .",
    "suppose that the agn jet is beamed into a fraction @xmath359 of the full sky . in a simple model with a uniform blr gas density @xmath360 within a spherical blr with thomson depth @xmath361 ,",
    "the total mass in the beaming cone is @xmath362 , where @xmath363 ( see @xcite for blrs with radially dependent densities ) .",
    "the time for blr material to pass through the cone of the jet with opening half - angle @xmath364 is @xmath365 s , where the mass of the central supermassive black hole is @xmath366 . assuming that the directional power of relativistic plasma expelled in the agn jets is comparable to the apparent isotropic gamma - ray luminosity @xmath367 , then the flow will be significantly decelerated when @xmath368 , where @xmath5 is the lorentz factor of the plasma outflow .",
    "thus , unless the mean apparent isotropic luminosity exceeds @xmath369 the jet will be quenched by sweeping up blr gas . this quenching process could make it difficult to form extended relativistic jets on the 10 - 100 kpc scale , as may be required to explain enhanced x - ray emission in the knots of pks 0637 - 752 @xcite .",
    "the transport of inner jet energy to the extended jets via neutral beams avoids this difficulty .",
    "the neutrons and gamma - rays will pass through the blr material without attenuation unless the thomson depth of blr is very high , with @xmath370 . in these cases",
    "the jet and neutral beam outflow would be quenched , the nonthermal radiation would be reprocessed into lower energy emissions , and only the neutrino signal would penetrate through the dense inner region without reprocessing .",
    "if so , the neutrino emission from such buried jets in non - blazar sources could reveal these types of agn .",
    "we return to this speculation in section 4.4 .",
    "relativistic neutrons produced by @xmath32 collisions in the compact inner jet are no longer confined by the jet s magnetic field , and so can escape from the blob unless the neutron decays or interacts with another soft photon that results in conversion to a proton inside the blob .",
    "our calculations show that in fsrqs with luminous external radiation fields , up to @xmath371 of the total energy injected into the blob in the form of relativistic protons with @xmath372 can leave the blob in the form of relativistic neutrons with lorentz factors @xmath373 .    for the case of fsrqs , neutrons escaping the inner blob continue to propagate in the blr with its quasi - isotropic scattered accretion - disk radiation up to distances @xmath374 - 1 pc .",
    "subsequent interactions of the neutron beam with the scattered disk photons will result in the production of beamed secondaries .",
    "neutrino secondaries will add to the overall neutrino flux .",
    "importantly , a beam of gamma - rays with energies above @xmath375 is also produced . because these gamma - rays are made outside the blob and propagate radially outward in the blob s frame , they do not interact with the internal synchrotron photons , and therefore have a chance to escape from the central region of the quasar ( see figure 2 ) . depending on the extent and intensity of the isotropic external radiation field , as much as several per cent of the accelerated proton energy @xmath376 ) injected in the inner jet at distances @xmath377",
    "could thus be converted to gamma - rays which escape from the blr .",
    "figure 8 shows the mean - free - path of gamma rays due to pair - production interactions with photons of the diffuse cosmic microwave background radiation for @xmath378 ( solid curve ) and @xmath226 ( dashed curve ) .",
    "this calculation also takes into account the diffuse extragalactic infrared radiation field .",
    "we approximate this field by a spectrum @xmath379 at the level of total energy density @xmath380 ev @xmath14 between @xmath381 mm and 1 mm @xcite , though the precise value is not important on the size scales @xmath382 mpc under consideration .",
    "our calculations show that more energy is typically carried out from the blr by relativistic neutrons than by gamma rays .",
    "this is especially true if the degradation of the neutron beam escaping the blob but still in the blr is not very strong , which will always be the case for neutrons escaping the blob at distances @xmath383 .",
    "the energy carried away by neutrons with @xmath384 may reach @xmath385 of @xmath376 ) for accelerated protons with number index @xmath386 . adding the energy of the gamma rays to this",
    ", we find that @xmath387 can be used as a rough estimate for the fraction of total ( starting from 1 gev ) energy of accelerated protons in the inner jet that is carried by the collimated beam of uhe neutrons and gamma rays to @xmath388kpc distances in fsrqs .    for a flare like the one in february 1996 from 3c 279",
    ", the gamma - ray fluence measured with egret corresponds to an apparent isotropic energy release of @xmath389 .",
    "assuming that the injection power in nonthermal protons in the inner jet is the same as for the parent electrons , the overall total energy in the neutral beam emerging from the inner jet per a single such flare could reach the level @xmath390 in the stationary frame .",
    "this energy will be collimated in the cone with opening angle @xmath391 , and it will be deposited at distances up to 0.1 - 1 mpc , provided that the spectra of ultra - high energy neutrons extend up to @xmath392-@xmath393 , as in figure 4b .",
    "after neutron - decay or gamma - ray attenuation , the charged particles emerging in the direction of the parent neutral beam will interact with the ambient extragalactic medium via local magnetic and photon fields . in the case of the neutrons ,",
    "a small fraction @xmath394 of the neutron energy will appear in the form of @xmath395-decay electrons with lorentz - factors @xmath396 .",
    "this energy will be immediately available for radiation in the synchrotron and compton processes with @xmath108 peaks at hard x - ray and multi - tev energies , respectively , for a 1 @xmath397 g field and a dominant local cmb radiation field @xcite .",
    "the dominant fraction of the initial neutron energy remains , however , in the protons .",
    "synchrotron radiation of ultrarelativistic neutron - decay protons could in principle explain the extended _ chandra _ x - ray jet emission if the ambient magnetic field is sufficiently large @xcite .",
    "proton synchrotron radiation does not , however , provide a mechanism for deposition of energy of the neutral beam into the surrounding medium to drive shocks and accelerate @xmath351 - 100 gev electrons , which is required to explain the radio and optical emission from the extended jets .    in order for the transport of energy by the neutrons to be efficient from the point of view of powering the extended jets in radio galaxies",
    ", there should be a mechanism for effective transfer of the neutron - decay proton energy to the surrounding plasma .",
    "such a mechanism is expected through interactions of the relativistic protons as well as the @xmath398-@xmath399 pairs from the gamma - ray beam with the ambient magnetic field in the surrounding medium . in the case of a significant transverse magnetic - field component @xmath400 ,",
    "both the protons and leptons will change their initial directions on the larmor timescales @xmath401 , which implies that a significant fraction of their momentum and energy will be transferred to the ambient medium .",
    "another , and possibly even more effective way for transferring the initial momentum and energy of the charged particles is by generating mhd turbulence through beam instabilities excited by the highly beamed neutron - decay protons and charged secondaries emerging from the charge - neutral beam .",
    "the continuous transfer of momentum and energy from the beam to the intergalactic medium could stretch the ambient magnetic field to form a channel facilitating beam propagation , or drive the medium into relativistic motion in the forward direction to create a powerful relativistic shock .    in the latter scenario",
    ", relativistic shocks can accelerate ambient electrons ( as well as protons ) , thereby injecting a power - law electron spectra @xmath402 with @xmath403 in the downstream region .",
    "synchrotron radiation from these electrons could then explain @xcite the broad - band nonthermal radio , optical , and x - ray emission from hot spots and knots in the extended x - ray jets of extragalactic jet sources observed with the _",
    "chandra observatory_. the idea that the observed x - ray jets might be due to propagation of a powerful beam of gamma rays has also been considered by @xcite @xcite , who suggested a ",
    "non - acceleration \" scenario , where the observed x - rays could be due to synchrotron radiation from electrons formed in the electromagnetic cascade initiated by ultra - high energy gamma rays .",
    "our calculations show that although some contribution to the observed x - ray fluxes from the cascade electrons is not excluded , the spectral features of the observed radiation , in particular , x - ray energy spectral indices @xmath404 , might be difficult to explain in a pure cascade scenario .",
    "moreover , interpretation of the radio and optical fluxes from the same x - ray knots apparently makes unavoidable the requirement of in - situ acceleration of electrons in the x - ray knots .",
    "given the total energy released by the neutrons and gamma rays per single flare , the energetics of these kpc - scale knots could be explained by superposition of jet activity on time scales up to thousands of yrs ( since @xmath405 translates to @xmath406 of light travel time ) .",
    "thus , the bright knots might represent the observable signatures of the past history of activity of the central engine of the blazar when powerful acceleration of uhe cosmic rays had occurred in the inner jets of the source .",
    "considering now the bl lac objects , we note that in the case of weak or negligible external radiation field components , any significant transport of the inner jet energy by ultra - high energy gamma - rays in those objects is practically absent .",
    "this is because gamma - rays are not produced through @xmath52 interactions of the neutrons outside the compact blob , whereas the ultra - high energy gamma - rays produced in @xmath32 collisions inside the blob will be absorbed due to @xmath30 collisions with the same internal synchrotron target photons ( recall that @xmath407 ) .",
    "nevertheless , up to @xmath385 of the energy injected into the inner jet in relativistic protons with @xmath408 could still be taken out of the blob by neutrons with @xmath409 due to @xmath32 collisions with synchrotron photons while the blob remains compact .",
    "because of the latter limitations , and because bl lac sources are generally much less powerful than fsrqs , the total energy that the neutron beam can extract from the accelerated protons is much less for bl lacs than for fsrqs .",
    "moreover , because of the smaller sizes and magnetic fields inferred for bl lac objects , the level of neutron production and the maximum energy of accelerated protons is reduced in the former class of sources .",
    "thus the neutral beam power is much less in bl lac objects than in fsrqs .      as a consequence of processes occurring in the inner jets of blazars",
    ", we predict that powerful collimated neutral beams that extend as far as hundreds of kpc from the nucleus are ejected in the axial jet directions in high luminosity fsrqs .",
    "the linearity and the spatial extent of the ejecta is a consequence of the decay properties of the neutrals .",
    "this process can explain the origin of x - ray jets detected by _",
    "chandra _ , which appear straight on scales of up to mpc , such as the jet in pictor a @xcite .",
    "the linearity of the radio jets in cygnus a @xcite may also be a consequence of energetic neutral beams powering the lobes of powerful fr ii galaxies .",
    "this interpretation avoids firehose instabilities in models invoking magnetic fields to collimate the extended fr ii radio jets , or problems associated with jet quenching , as discussed in section 4.2 .",
    "our model predicts that lower luminosity blazars , in particular , the lineless bl lac objects , have orders - of - magnitude weaker neutral beams than fsrqs .",
    "the maximum energies of the relativistic neutrons are also about an order - of - magnitude less in mrk 501-like bl lac objects than in 3c 279-like fsrqs",
    ". consequently the x - ray jets driven by the high - energy neutron beams will be generally fainter ( despite their relative proximity ) and shorter in bl lac objects .",
    "this could explain the faint kpc - scale x - ray jets detected from objects like 3c 371 @xcite , which is an off - axis bl lac object @xcite .",
    "we adopt the point of view , following @xcite , that fr i and fr ii galaxies are the parent populations of bl lac objects and fsrqs , respectively .",
    "the less powerful beams of neutrons that occupy smaller spatial scales in bl lac objects compared to fsrqs conforms to the measured relative power requirements in fr i and fr ii galaxies @xcite .",
    "if fr i / bl lacs have smaller lorentz factors than fr ii / fsrqs , as also inferred from observations of these sources @xcite , then the weak , broad twin - jet morphologies in fr i galaxies can be qualitatively understood .",
    "we point out that even though the inner parsec regions of a bl lac are much less dense than the blrs in fsrqs in view of their relative emission line strengths , the jet quenching problem ( section 4.2 ) can still be severe for bl lac objects because of their weaker jets .",
    "the transport of energy by neutral particles to the extended jet will be enhanced by an intense external radiation field in the inner regions of the jet .",
    "the total power into the jet depends foremost on the accretion rate , which depends on the amount of gas and dust available to fuel a supermassive black hole .",
    "thus our model is consistent with the evolutionary scenario proposed by @xcite and @xcite to explain the spectral sequence of fsrqs , and low- and high - frequency peaked bl lac objects . according to this picture , fsrqs evolve into bl lac objects due to a reduction in the accretion rate of the surrounding dust and gas that fuels the central black hole .",
    "( note , however , that the jet power is derived primarily from mass accretion in the scenario of @xcite and from the spin energy of the black hole in the scenario of @xcite . )",
    "@xcite argue that this picture accounts for the correlation between the radio jet and accretion power , where the latter is inferred from emission line strengths .",
    "high - energy neutrino observations will be crucial to test this scenario , as neutral beams of high energy neutrons and gamma - rays will be made in association with high - energy neutrinos .",
    "finally we speculate that if ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasars evolve into radio - loud agns @xcite , then some ultraluminous infrared galaxies could harbor buried jet sources that will be revealed through their high - energy neutrino emission .",
    "production of narrow beams of ultra - high energy neutrons with @xmath410 becomes possible if relativistic compact jets of blazars accelerate cosmic rays to these energies .",
    "such neutral relativistic particle beams can be especially powerful in fsrqs , where the neutrons are efficiently produced in @xmath32 interactions with photons of the external quasi - isotropic radiation field on timescale of years ( since the broad - line region size scale @xmath411 - 1 pc ) . in radio - loud jet sources ,",
    "the beam could contain a significant fraction of ultra - high energy gamma - rays produced in the blr through @xmath52 photomeson interactions by neutrons which escape from the compact relativistic plasma blob that forms the inner jet .",
    "these charge - neutral beams of uhe neutrons and gamma - rays ( including also neutrinos which , however , do not contribute to the process of energy transport ) do not interact with the extragalactic medium until either the neutrons decay or the gamma rays collide with soft photons on scales from kpc to mpc .",
    "the main soft - photon target for @xmath412 collisions is provided by the cmb radiation and , in some sufficiently powerful sources , also by low - frequency synchrotron radiation self - produced along the jet @xcite ) .",
    "the weaker neutral beams in fr i radio galaxies and bl lac objects , compared to fr ii radio galaxies and fsrqs , could explain the morphological differences between the two classes of radio galaxies .",
    "this scenario assumes that the inner jets of blazars are effective accelerators of high - energy cosmic rays .",
    "the limits on acceleration that we consider do not preclude the acceleration of cosmic rays to energies @xmath413 in blazars , especially in the more luminous fsrqs .",
    "this mechanism of relativistic energy transport from the central engine of agn to large distances avoids problems of jet quenching in the central gas - rich regions of agn , problems of adiabatic and radiative losses , and problems of long - term confinement and stability ( on scales up to @xmath414 ) of the jet against different plasma processes .",
    "beam instabilities can , however , provide an effective method to transfer the energy of ultra - relativistic protons emerging from the neutron beam into the surrounding medium , and driving relativistic shock which ultimately accelerates nonthermal electrons to radiate observable synchrotron and compton emission .",
    "given also the large amount of energy that such a beam may contain , which can be of the order of a few percent of the inner jet power , our results suggest that the detection by the _ chandra observatory _ of the narrow x - ray jets that remain straight on scales beyond several hundreds of kpc provides observational evidence that the relativistic inner jets of blazars , first of all the flat spectrum radio quasars , are powerful accelerators of uhe cosmic rays .",
    "detection of high - energy neutrinos from fsrqs with icecube or a northern hemisphere high - energy neutrino telescope will provide strong support for this scenario .",
    "relativistic neutrons are produced with @xmath415 probability in the inelastic collisions of relativistic protons either with an ambient thermal proton or with a photon above the photopion production threshold .",
    "however , the mass - loaded jet models , i.e. the ones invoking @xmath26 nuclear collisions , can be practically excluded on the basis of efficiency arguments .",
    "as equation ( [ tpp ] ) shows , nuclear interactions could provide energy loss time scales shorter than the dynamical time @xmath416 only if the source is very thick to thomson scattering , @xmath417 .",
    "if one requires that , say , non - thermal x - ray flux are produced during the flare , i.e. @xmath418 , then the observed fast decline of the fluxes could be attributed to the adiabatic losses of proton energy and fast decline of the gas density on dynamical time scale due to rapid expansion of the source .",
    "however , the overall energy losses of protons in nuclear interactions during that time can not exceed @xmath419 . in practice",
    "this means that the real power injected into the blob in the form of relativistic protons should be by a factor of @xmath420 larger than the power inferred from the observed radiation fluence .",
    "besides these inefficiency problems , a serious argument against hadronic nuclear interaction models is that the mass - loaded jets would require too great a total energy in the blob including the kinetic energy .",
    "thus , for a blob size @xmath421 with typical @xmath422 and @xmath423 the thomson scattering depth @xmath424 implies a gas density ( in terms of h - atoms , and omitting here the dependence on the source redshift @xmath425 ) @xmath426 .",
    "the jet mass then is @xmath427 , and the kinetic energy @xmath428erg for @xmath429 .",
    "thus , even such a jet with reduced efficiency should have a significant mass load leading to an unacceptably high energetics required in a single blob .",
    "it would be formally possible to bring the high kinetic energy requirements alone @xcite down to a formally acceptable values by reducing further the density of the gas .",
    "however , then the total energy of relativistic protons @xmath430 in the blob should be increased in order to provide a given level of radiation fluxes by @xmath26-interactions .",
    "indeed , the integral luminosity of the radiation that could be produced in @xmath26-interactions , is given by @xmath431 , where @xmath432 is the fraction of relativistic proton energy that goes to secondary electrons and gamma - rays .",
    "assuming that most of the electron energy will be processed to electromagnetic radiation , we can have @xmath433 , leaving the rest for the neutrinos . transforming from the blob frame to the observer ( or stationary ) frame",
    ", the total energy @xmath434 can be written as @xmath435 \\ ; , \\label{wtot}\\ ] ] where @xmath436 is the total energy flux , i.e. @xmath437 which is typically larger than the @xmath438 that a model is intended to explain . here",
    "we have assumed for the kinetic energy @xmath439 , and substituted @xmath440 for the inelasticity .",
    "the energy @xmath441 reaches a minimum at the density @xmath442 where @xmath443 , and @xmath444 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath441 is then @xmath445 here @xmath446 , and we have assumed @xmath447 in equation ( [ wtot ] ) .",
    "interestingly , @xmath448 is reached when the kinetic and internal cr energies become equal .",
    "note that any noticeable deviation of the real density in the jet from @xmath449 required for @xmath448 will immediately increase further the total energy requirement given by equation ( [ wtot ] ) .    a hadronic nuclear interaction jet model which could make any significant contribution to the fluxes of flares observed by egret from fsrqs , would have to assume an absolute ( in the stationary frame ) energy in a single flare exceeding by orders of magnitude an energy of a supernova explosion . even for a less powerful but much closer blazars ,",
    "like bl lac objects mrk 421 or mrk 501 , any significant contribution to the total radiation flux from mass - loaded nuclear interaction jet models can be practically excluded .",
    "indeed , even taking into account that the variability timescale might be as short as 1 h instead of 1 day , for interpretation of the maximum fluxes at the level of @xmath450 the minimum energy @xmath451 would still significantly exceed the ` supernova ' level @xmath452 , which is problematic to accept for these objects with a relatively modest average bolometric luminosities .",
    "the only type of relativistic extragalactic sources for which the hadronic nuclear interaction models could still be reasonable from the general total - energy consideration seem grb sources where variability timescale is very short ( hence the densities could be very high ) although the peak fluxes are much higher than for relativistic jets .",
    "noticing that @xmath453 is actually a good estimate for the fluence @xmath454 observed during the flare , we can re - write equation ( [ wmin ] ) as @xmath455 where @xmath456 .",
    "obviously , this is a reasonable value for grb source , although the question on the efficiency of the @xmath26-interaction model in case of simultaneous detection of non - thermal x - rays and gamma - rays should be still addressed .",
    "equations ( [ ss ] ) and ( [ uext ] ) can now be used to estimate the relative importance of the photomeson interactions of relativistic nucleons with the direct and scattered components of the accretion disk radiation , respectively . for the direct disk radiation photon spectral density @xmath457",

    "a similar analytic estimate for the coefficient @xmath473 is derived for the scattered quasi - isotropic component of the external radiation field ( [ uext ] ) . for distances @xmath474 ,",
    "i.e. inside the blr with dimensionless radius @xmath475 , this results in @xmath476 where @xmath477 , with @xmath478 , as described above .",
    "because the scattered radiation is quasi - isotropic , the interaction threshold condition for photopion production in this field is the same at all heights @xmath479 , and is defined by head - on collisions of protons and neutrons with photons with maximum energy @xmath480 . for @xmath481 ,",
    "this requires nucleon energies @xmath482 .",
    "meanwhile , because of the follow - on collisions that nucleons , which are moving predominantly along the jet away from the black hole , make with the photons of the direct disk radiation field , the interaction threshold of the nucleons with this field significantly increases with increasing height @xmath483 . from equation ( [ threshold ] ) , we find @xmath484 , taking into account that the function @xmath485 reaches a maximum @xmath486 at @xmath487 .",

    "<S> we treat the production of neutrons , photons , and neutrinos through photomeson interactions of relativistic protons with ambient photons in the compact inner jets of blazars . internal synchrotron and external isotropic radiation due to scattered optical / uv accretion - disk radiation </S>",
    "<S> are considered as target photon fields . </S>",
    "<S> protons are assumed to be accelerated to a maximum energy limited by the size scale and magnetic field of the jet , and by competing energy losses . </S>",
    "<S> we characterize the conditions when the photomeson interactions of ultrarelativistic protons become effective , and show that the presence of the external radiation field makes possible strong energy losses already for protons with energies @xmath0 ev . without this component , effective energy losses of protons begin at @xmath1 ev , and would rapidly disappear with expansion of the blob .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop a model describing the production and escape of neutrons from a comoving spherical blob , which continue to interact with the ambient external radiation field on the parsec - scale broad line region ( blr ) . </S>",
    "<S> neutrons may carry @xmath2% of the overall energy of the accelerated protons with @xmath3 ev outside the blr . </S>",
    "<S> ultra - high energy gamma rays produced by photomeson interaction of neutrons outside the blob can also escape the blr . </S>",
    "<S> the escaping neutrons , gamma rays , and neutrinos form a collimated neutral beam with a characteristic opening angle @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the bulk lorentz factor of the inner jet . energy and momentum is deposited in the extended jet from the decay of neutrons at distances @xmath6 kpc , and through pair - production attenuation of gamma rays with energies @xmath7 ev which propagate to @xmath8 - 100 kpc distances . in this scenario </S>",
    "<S> , neutral beams of ultra - high energy gamma rays and neutrons can be the reason for straight extended jets such as in pictor a. fluxes of neutrinos detectable with km - scale neutrino telescopes are predicted from flat spectrum radio quasars such as 3c 279 . </S>"
