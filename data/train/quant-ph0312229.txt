    "the capability to control and manipulate quantum systems that has been developed in recent years holds promise for applying quantum systems to information processing @xcite .",
    "this possible application has drawn much attention to the subject of decoherence / dephasing , where the concept of  fidelity  and  survival probability  plays a major role .",
    "some of the possible quantum information schemes involve superposition states of the internal states of trapped neutral atoms or ions .",
    "interaction with the trapping potential often causes these superposition states to dephase , but , in analogy with the spin echo @xcite , a coherence `` echo '' can be used to preserve the coherence @xcite",
    "@xcite @xcite . under certain conditions",
    "the echo coherence of trapped atoms is limited by the quantum dynamics of the atoms in the trap , thereby enabling study of quantum dynamics by echo techniques , but also stressing that the quantum dynamics of the atoms in the trap is of great importance to the coherence of their internal states @xcite .    in this paper the dephasing of trapped atoms in coherent superposition states of their internal states",
    "is investigated .",
    "a special focus is put on neutral atoms trapped in optical dipole traps , where the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic namely atom - optics billiards @xcite@xcite .",
    "this is done partly because chaotic billiards where used in the past as a simplified model to describe decoherence @xcite , and partly because they can have very long coherence times @xcite .",
    "the atoms are considered  hot  , meaning that their temperature is much larger than the mean level spacing of the trap , so they occupy high excited states in the trap , and an output of the experiment is an ensemble average over many occupied states .",
    "the strength of the dipole potential depends on the internal state of the atom .",
    "this causes atoms initially in coherent superposition states of their internal degree of freedom but with different external initial conditions to acquire different phases thereby loosing the macroscopic coherence .",
    "this dephasing can be suppressed by echo techniques , where each part of the superposition state spends an equal amount of time in each potential , thereby ensuring that the phases acquired are equal @xcite@xcite . however , since the external potentials are slightly different ( we denote this difference `` the perturbation '' ) , also the dynamics depends on the internal state , and loss of coherence from this is not cancelled by echo techniques . for far - off",
    "-resonance optical dipole traps such a perturbation is small , so a perturbative result is of great interest . in section [ per ] a perturbative expression for the echo signal is derived , and confirmed numerically , showing that the echo signal can be written as a function of the survival probability or fidelity of eigenstates of the motion of the atoms in the trap .",
    "based on this perturbative result the long - time echo coherence of atomic ensembles is predicted .    in the perturbative limit the echo coherence and the survival probability display  system specific  features , despite the fact that the underlying classical dynamics is ergodic@xcite .",
    "this is demonstrated in section [ fire ] by showing partial revivals in the echo signal and the survival probability for a perturbation consisting of a small spacial shift of the potential . in section [ fem ]",
    "a `` semiclassical '' perturbative expression for the averaged echo coherence is derived .",
    "two billiard systems are considered throughout the paper .",
    "first , an `` idealized '' system - a shift perturbation of the hard - wall bunimovich billiard @xcite where eigenstates can be computed efficiently @xcite is used to confirm the validity of the perturbative and semiclassical approximations by comparing them to a full quantum calculation ( sections [ fire ] and [ fem ] ) .",
    "these approximations are then used in section [ seks ] to calculate the echo coherence for micro wave ( mw ) spectroscopy of atoms in an experimental realizable atom optics billiard , namely the light - sheet wedge billiard @xcite @xcite , where revivals in analogy with those in the hard - wall stadium are found .",
    "this suggest that revivals of coherence may be a generic feature of optical dipole traps .",
    "in this section pulsed micro wave spectroscopy on optical trapped alkali atoms is considered .",
    "the ground state of alkali atoms contains two hyperfine states with an energy splitting of @xmath0 , each containing several magnetic substates .",
    "the hyperfine energy splitting in caesium atoms is the foundation of modern time scales , so mw spectroscopy of this transition in an isolated environment is of great importance and is therefore a very advanced field .",
    "however , many quantum information processing schemes require trapped atoms or ions , and if neutral alkali atoms are placed inside an optical trapping potential , then the energy levels are changed .",
    "since the optical dipole potential is inversely proportional to the detuning of the trap laser from resonance @xcite and the detuning will differ by the hyperfine splitting , then there is a slight difference in potential for atoms in different hyperfine states , even if the states considered have the same matrix element for the dipole interaction with the trapping light .",
    "for such two states ( denoted @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) the hamiltonian considered can be written as , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the atomic center of mass momentum and @xmath5 [ @xmath6 the external potential for an atom in state @xmath7 [ @xmath8 .",
    "typically @xmath9 is much smaller than @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite@xcite .",
    "the eigenenergies of this hamiltonian consist of two manifolds ( belonging to @xmath12 and @xmath1 ) separated in energy by @xmath10 ( see fig .",
    "[ fi1 ] ) .    the initial step in mw spectroscopy is to prepare all the atoms in one of the spin states involved ( @xmath7 ) , so their total wave function can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 represents the motional ( external degree of freedom ) part of their wave function .",
    "if atoms prepared in @xmath15 are irradiated with a mw field close to resonance with @xmath16 , then transitions between eigenstates belonging to different manifolds can be driven .",
    "the matrix elements for these transitions is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the free space matrix element for the internal state transition , and @xmath19 is the overlap between @xmath20 , the initial eigenstate of @xmath21 , and @xmath22 , the final eigenstate of @xmath23 ( here the very small momentum of the mw photon is neglected ) . since in general each of the eigenstates in the @xmath2-manifold",
    "is coupled to many eigenstates in the @xmath24-manifold by the mw - field , there is no simple prediction of the wave function after mw irradiation .",
    "however , in the simple limit of very short mw - pulses the external wave function is left unchanged and only the internal state of the atom is changed .",
    "such a short pulse that puts atoms initially in @xmath15 , into the coherent superposition state @xmath25 is called a @xmath26-pulse and a pulse that flips the spin to @xmath27 is called a @xmath28-pulse .    in the widely used ramsey spectroscopy technique @xcite ,",
    "atoms initially prepared in @xmath29 ( assumed to be a pure state ) and irradiated with a @xmath26-pulse to generate the wave function @xmath30 .",
    "after some time @xmath31 this state will , in the rotating frame of the mw field , evolve into @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mw - detuning .",
    "then the atoms are irradiated with a second @xmath26-pulse generating the wave function @xmath34 .",
    "the population of state @xmath35 is then , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a phase depending on the initial state @xmath38 and the dynamics of it in the trap . by choosing @xmath39 sufficiently large , compared to variations in @xmath37 eq .",
    "[ ram ] yields the well known cosinusodial ramsey - fringes as a function of @xmath40 , but with a fringe contrast reduced to the square root of the fidelity of the external motion in the trap @xmath41 . in the case where @xmath38 is an eigenstate of @xmath21",
    ", the fidelity can be written @xmath42 and is therefore often denoted the survival probability of @xmath43 in @xmath23 . because the fidelity shows up in many such simple experiments , especially in connection to quantum information processing schemes where it measures the overlap between the desired state @xmath44 and the actual state @xmath45 , and because it can be used as an indicator of quantum chaos ,",
    "its decay have been an immensely studied topic throughout @xcite .",
    "however , experiments are often not performed with atoms initially prepared in a pure initial state @xmath38 , but with atoms in a thermal mixture of states .",
    "since @xmath46 depends on the initial state , then the fringe contrast in a ramsey experiment will decay rapidly , not due to a decay in the fidelity of the individual states thermally populated , but because the cosine terms from different populated states get out of phase @xcite .",
    "this rapid loss of coherence is a problem in quantum information schemes @xcite and prevents the use of ramsey spectroscopy for studying quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "the loss in coherence may be overcome by adding an additional potential making @xmath47 , and thereby decoupling the external dynamics from the spectroscopic evolution @xcite .",
    "this is however not always possible and does not enable the use of mw - spectroscopy for dynamical studies .",
    "the echo pulse sequence demonstrated in @xcite@xcite@xcite provides a more general solution to suppress the inhomogeneous dephasing of superposition states .",
    "the echo pulse sequence consists of three short pulses ( @xmath48 ) , separated by two dark periods of equal duration @xmath31 , after which the population of @xmath49 is measured . in analogy to eq .",
    "[ ram ] the population of state @xmath1 can be written as : @xmath50   \\label{echo}\\ ] ] in the following we denote the quantity @xmath51 the  echo amplitude  .",
    "@xmath52 indicates complete preservation of coherence and yields @xmath53 , whereas @xmath54 , yielding @xmath55 indicates complete loss of coherence @xcite . from eq .",
    "[ echo ] it is seen that the echo amplitude is insensitive to the addition of constants to @xmath23 and @xmath56 , so in contrary to the ramsey signal ( eq . [ ram ] ) @xmath57 of eq .",
    "[ echo ] does not depend on @xmath58 and @xmath10 , but only on the quantum dynamics of the atoms in the potentials .",
    "the rapid loss of coherence when a thermal mixtures of states is considered has vanished , making echo techniques of interest in experiments on quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "this also means that even for thermal mixtures of states echo spectroscopy can yield information on the quantum dynamics of the trapped atoms , as was demonstrated in @xcite for more than @xmath59 thermally populated states .",
    "in this section a second order perturbative expression for the echo amplitude of an eigenstate is derived , showing that it can be written as a function of the fidelity or survival amplitude , thereby also predicting the time average of the echo amplitude .    since",
    "thermal atoms can be considered as a mixture of eigenstates , the attention is now turned to the echo amplitude of an eigenstate of @xmath21 .",
    "the echo amplitude of an eigenstate @xmath60 of @xmath56  can be rewritten : @xmath61 since adding constants to @xmath23 and @xmath21 does not change the echo we can without loss of generality set @xmath62 .",
    "now for atoms trapped in far off resonance optical dipole traps made of linearly polarized light the difference between @xmath63 and @xmath21 is very small , so a perturbative result is of great interest . for a small perturbation @xmath64 and @xmath65",
    "is of the order @xmath66 or less . rewriting eq .",
    "[ ech2 ] and keeping only terms up to order @xmath67 yields : @xmath68 this rewriting does not look like a simplification of eq .",
    "[ ech2 ] , but first it is noted that the echo is no longer a function of @xmath69matrix elements like @xmath70 but only a of their absolute value square , often referred to as the local density of states ( ldos ) @xcite .",
    "second , note that since @xmath71 , then typically @xmath72 , so except for extreme long times the approximation @xmath73 can be used . for high excited states",
    "@xmath74 is also a good approximation , for times much shorter than @xmath75 with @xmath76 the mean level spacing . using these approximations eq .",
    "[ longex ] can be rewritten as : @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",
    "the quantity @xmath79 is denoted the survival amplitude ( @xmath80 ) , since its length square is the survival probability . writing the survival amplitude in the same way as eq .",
    "[ shex ] shows that eq .",
    "[ shex ] yields a simple relation between the echo amplitude and the survival amplitude of an eigenstate in the perturbative limit : @xmath81 eq .",
    "[ etsp ] indicates that the time average of the echo amplitude is always smaller than the time average of the survival amplitude .",
    "hence in the low temperature regime , where the decay of coherence is set by the decay of the survival amplitude , and not by the thermal spread of initial conditions , a ramsey type experiment will yield better coherence than an echo experiment ( see eq .",
    "[ ram ] ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental results published in @xcite .    from eq .",
    "[ shex ] it is seen that for times @xmath31 where the approximation @xmath82 is valid , the constant contribution to the echo signal is not given by the infinite long time limit @xmath83 but by @xmath84 .",
    "this is a rather peculiar result since @xmath85 hence it implies that waiting for dephasing to occur on time scales of @xmath86 will increase the ensemble average of the echo coherence .",
    "for perturbations that conserve the eigenspectrum the @xmath87 echo level persists for all times .    in",
    "@xcite we compared the measured long time echo signal for atoms confined in a gaussian laser beam to a calculation based on the ensemble average of the infinite time level of @xmath88 .",
    "however , approximating the gaussian trap of @xcite by a harmonic oscillator yields that typically @xmath89 , whereas the long time echo level was measured when the initial oscillations had died out , typically after @xmath90 .",
    "hence , from the perturbative treatment we expect to observe the ensemble averaged @xmath87 echo level rather than the @xmath91 level .",
    "we repeated the echo - level calculation of @xcite using now the assumption that the long time echo signal is given by @xmath92 , and found better agreement with the experimental data published in @xcite as compared to the @xmath88 calculation , but due to the uncertainty of the data points no definitive conclusion can be made @xcite .",
    "finally , the simplified model presented here predicts that if @xmath93 for all occupied states , then perfect echo coherence will persist for infinite times . in real systems , there are effects , such as photon scattering or temporal fluctuations in the trap depth not taken into account in our model ( eq . [ ham ] ) causing echo coherence to be lost on long time scales @xcite @xcite .",
    "in this section the validity of eq . [ etsp ] and the behavior of the quantities involved in it , are investigated by numerical calculations on a chaotic hard wall burnimovich stadium @xcite .",
    "this system is used as a test system , since the burnimovich stadium has become almost a synonym with classical chaotic billiard dynamics , and since the scaling method of @xcite@xcite enables efficient computation of high excited eigenstates of this system .",
    "it is demonstrated that the echo amplitude and the survival probability show partial revivals at certain times for a spacial shift perturbation .",
    "the stadium considered consists of two semicircles of radius 1 , connected by two lines of length 2 ( see fig .",
    "[ fi3 ] ) .",
    "we consider the perturbation caused by shifting @xmath94 a small amount along the long axis of the stadium compared to @xmath95 .",
    "this perturbation conserves the eigenspectrum so @xmath96 .",
    "the shift also has direct relevance to the  dephasing free  atom optics billiard proposed in @xcite , and illustrates some of the points of later sections .",
    "the computation of the echo and the survival probability is done in the straight forward way .",
    "a large cluster containing @xmath97 eigenstates with energies around 11000 is computed using the scaling method of @xcite . the units h-.2em.2em",
    "= 2m=1 are used so the eigenstates in the interior of the billiard are solutions to @xmath98 and are vanishing on the boundary .",
    "the transformation matrix @xmath99 taking states from a representation in eigenstates of  @xmath23 to a representation in eigenstates of @xmath21 is then computed by computing the overlap integral of the eigenstates of @xmath23 with those of @xmath21 ( the length square of the elements of @xmath99 being the ldos @xcite ) .",
    "the computation of the overlaps is efficiently done using the methods of @xcite . since the time evolution of a state in the representation of eigenstates of the hamiltonian under which it evolves is trivial",
    ", it is a trivial task to compute the echo and the survival amplitude when @xmath99 is known using eq .",
    "the issue of @xmath99 not being completely unitary for a hard wall billiard is addressed in @xcite .",
    "the structure of @xmath99 can depend on the perturbation even when the underlying classical dynamics is chaotic @xcite@xcite @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fi4 ] a plot of the square of the elements of @xmath99 is shown for the perturbation of a shift of 0.004 , where two distinct sidebands are seen .",
    "this structure induces special behavior of the echo and the survival probability , since an eigenstate of @xmath56 will show a ( partial ) revival when evolved in @xmath100 at the time the sidebands have acquired a phase of 2@xmath28 .",
    "this is demonstrated in fig [ fi5 ] , where the echo and survival probability for several different eigenstates are shown .",
    "they all show revivals at the time @xmath101  corresponding to the sidebands acquiring a phase of 2@xmath102 at longer times the revivals from different states get out of phase due to the finite width of the sidebands in fig .",
    "we note that the revivals seen in fig .",
    "[ fi5 ] are not the trivial revivals originating from the system being discrete , but they appears since the nature of the difference between @xmath56 and @xmath23 induces `` selection rules '' that determines to which states in @xmath23 an eigenstate of @xmath21 is coupled .    shown in fig .",
    "[ fi6 ] is the perturbative approximation eq .",

    "it is seen that the deviation grows as @xmath103 , as expected from eq .",
    "[ etsp ] being a second order approximation to the echo .",
    "this indicates that the other approximations made are valid .    in fig .",
    "[ fi7 ] the difference between the exact echo and the approximation ( eq . [ etsp ] ) is shown , for long times , for one of the states of fig .",
    "no divergence as a function of time is observed .",
    "this is subscribed to the fact that the terms neglected in order to obtain eq .",
    "[ etsp ] are oscillatory in time .",
    "in this section the echo amplitude of an ensemble of high excited eigenstates is calculated using classical estimations of the ldos @xcite . the method is confirmed by comparison to a full quantum calculation on a hard - wall burnimovich stadium .",
    "it is then used in section [ seks ] to calculate the echo in a chaotic atom optics billiard , that have been demonstrated experimentally in the past @xcite@xcite .",
    "revivals in analogy with those of the previous section are found to appear .    from the fact that the perturbative limit is considered so @xmath104 ( where @xmath105 stands for the average of @xmath106 ) it",
    "is apparent that eq.s [ longex]-[etsp ] also hold for averages .",
    "this means that classical methods @xcite@xcite@xcite can be used to estimate the average ldos and from this the averaged echo amplitude can be computed .",
    "a detailed description of the computation of the classical estimations of the ldos is given in @xcite@xcite@xcite , so we only give a brief review of the steps involved .",
    "writing @xmath107 then first order perturbation theory gives that : @xmath108 for high excited states the band profile of the matrix @xmath109 can be estimated classically as : @xmath110 where the average is taken over few adjacent states , @xmath111 is the mean level spacing and @xmath112 is determined as following .",

    "@xmath119 is an ensemble average of all classical trajectories of energy @xmath121 , but since a chaotic system is considered , this can be taken as one long trajectory . the deeper reasons for the validity of eq .",

    "is shown in fig [ fi8 ] .",
    "it is seen that the semiclassical result does not resemble the echo of an individual eigenstate , but shows good agreement with an average of 15 adjacent eigenstates . since ",
    "atoms are considered the population of eigenstates is a slowly varying function of the eigenstate number , thereby enabling the ensemble - averaged echo signal to be computed .",
    "the evaluation of @xmath119 for the hard wall billiard is done following refs .",
    "the revivals occur at times @xmath125 with @xmath126 being the ballistic time .",
    "the shift conserves the eigenspectrum of the billiard , hence mixing to nearby states is suppressed @xcite . for a more generic perturbation such mixing effects can occur , thereby drastically reducing the range of perturbation where the approximation @xmath127 is valid @xcite@xcite .",
    "however , the major part of the probability will still be contained in a very narrow  core  and for short timescales this core will not have time to dephase . therefore we can neglect the decay of the core and replace @xmath128 in eq .",
    "[ shex ] with @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the core state , sum only over states outside the core , and still get a reasonable estimation of the echo for short times .",
    "now the attention is turned to an experimental atom - optics billiard , namely the light - sheet wedge @xcite@xcite .",
    "we consider a wedge made from two elliptical gaussian beams with widths of 10 @xmath131 by 150 @xmath131 .",
    "the wedge points downwards so gravity confines atoms in it .",
    "the wedge angle is 98 degree and the sheets cross 67 @xmath131 from the centers .",
    "only two dimensions are considered , so the ballistic time in the third dimension is assumed to be much longer than the experiment time ( as in ref .",
    "alternatively , the atoms can be confined in the third dimension by a very far off resonance one dimensional optical lattice , that essentially freezes the motion in that direction @xcite .",
    "a long classical trajectory is computed for a @xmath132 atom with an energy of 1.1@xmath133 j thus reaching a maximal height of 80 @xmath131 above the bottom of the wedge .",
    "the laser power of the wedge is taken to be 10 mw and the trap laser wavelength 779 nm ( the resonant wavelength of the @xmath134-line is 780 nm ) . in fig [ fi9 ] a poincar surface of section is presented showing that the classical motion of the atom in this billiard is indeed chaotic in spite of it not being the idealized wedge billiard @xcite .",
    "the two states considered @xmath135 ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath136 ( @xmath1 ) are separated by the hyperfine splitting of 3 ghz . due to the difference in strength of dipole potential @xmath23 and @xmath56",
    "are related @xmath137 with @xmath138 for the parameters considered .",
    "if the wedge had been made from exponentially decaying evanescent waves close to a prism surface instead of gaussian light - sheets then the change in strength in dipole potential can be described as a shift of the entire potential along the vertical axis .",
    "since the shift perturbation conserves the eigenspectrum such traps are expected to yield very long coherence times and the use of echo techniques would not be necessary @xcite . however , for a trap made from gaussian light - sheets as we here consider , the perturbation does not have a simple geometric interpretation and does not conserve the eigenspectrum .",
    "therefore echo techniques is expected to be of relevance , and the effects demonstrated is not expected to be limited to eigenspectrum conserving perturbations .    using the classical trajectory",
    "the echo amplitude is predicted by the methods of the previous section .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fi10 ] ( @xmath139 ) . in analogy to the hard - wall billiard example given above ,",
    "the echo is seen to revive at times around the ballistic time .",
    "this is the same phenomena as was observed in @xcite for atoms in a gaussian trap .",
    "these results indicates that the revivals demonstrated in @xcite , are not due to the gaussian trap being nearly harmonic , but a more generic feature of dipole traps even when the underlying dynamics is chaotic .",
