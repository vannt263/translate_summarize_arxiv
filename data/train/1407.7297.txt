    "the idea of feature screening came along as high dimensional data were collected in modern technology .",
    "it was aimed at dealing with the challenges of computational expediency , statistical accuracy and algorithmic stability due to high dimensionality .",
    "fan and lv proposed the sure independence screening ( sis ) @xcite and showed that the pearson correlation ranking procedure possessed a sure screening property for linear regression with gaussian predictors and responses .",
    "a new feature screening procedure for high dimensional data based on distance correlation @xcite , named dc - sis , was presented in @xcite .",
    "dc - sis retained the sure screening property of the sis , and additionally possessed new advantages of handling grouped predictors and multivariate responses by using distance correlation .",
    "moreover , since distance correlation was applicable to arbitrary distributions , dc - sis could also be used for screening features without specifying a regression model between the response and the predictors , and thus was robust to model mis - specification .    however , both sis and dc - sis relied on a user - specified model size @xmath0 which decided the number of predictors being selected .",
    "let the sample size be @xmath1 , @xmath0 was chosen to be multipliers of the integer part of @xmath2 in @xcite and @xcite which did not depend on any other characteristics of the data .",
    "as pointed out by a referee of @xcite , the choice of @xmath0 was of great importance in practical implementation and might influence the screening results significantly .",
    "our study is aimed at fixing this shortcoming by including an automatic stopping criteria for dc - sis based on the property of distance covariance .",
    "the screening procedures may fail if a feature is marginally uncorrelated , but jointly correlated with the response , or in the reverse situation where a feature is jointly uncorrelated but has higher marginal correlation than some important features .",
    "an iterative sis was proposed in @xcite to fix this problem .",
    "current research interest involves dealing with this drawback but this work is not related to this quest .",
    "we demonstrate our improved method through two real examples .",
    "the small round blue cell tumors ( srbct ) data were relatively easy to classify and had been studied extensively . the cancer genome atlas ( tcga ) ovarian cancer data",
    ", however , were much more challenging due to the large number of genes and limited sample size .",
    "the target was to identify the important genes that contribute to the sensitive or resistant status after receiving a particular chemotherapy treatment .",
    "a substantial fraction of the population was difficult to classify and a  withholding decision \" option is allowed in the support vector machine with reject option model to adapt to this fact .",
    "a multiple cross validation is used to quantify uncertainty given a humongous number of candidates , and we see a commonly observed dilemma that different variables are selected by using different subsets of the data .",
    "comparison between the results from the original data and those from the data obtained by randomly permuting the response provide further justification on our conclusions .",
    "furthermore , the multiple cross validation on the permuted data discloses the existence of spuriously correlated variables in high dimensional data and thus failure of variable selection and model building based on training data .",

    "this issue is common to selecting variables from a humongous number of candidates , in the not - low - hanging - fruit situation .",
    "the union of the 50 gene selections before svm - r consisted of 1245 genes and included all the 82 genes discussed previously .",
    "34 out of 1245 genes were chosen at least 10 times , where 33 of them appeared in the 82 genes , but very few appeared in more than 25 runs .",
    "the @xmath89 penalty provided additional elimination , and for @xmath108 , 498 out of 1245 genes remained after svm - r runs . _",

    "it is shown that a large number of genes with low frequency are further deleted by svm - r model , i.e. pink color .",
    ".,width=453 ]      our method involved several components , including variable selection , svm - r , mcv and the voting score , which were interacting with each other , and led to 15 patients with over @xmath109 accuracy to be sensitive for @xmath108 . to further understand the mechanism and to demonstrate that the outcomes were not produced by noises , we randomly permuted the response and went through the whole procedure to compare the results with those for the original data .",
    "it followed that the dcov method selected genes spuriously correlated with the permuted response based on the training data in each replication of the 50 mcvs .",
    "the maximum distance correlation value of the selected genes in each repetition was very close to that for the original data .",
    "the highly correlated genes appeared due to the high dimensionality of over 12000 genes and less than 200 training samples .",
    "however , the mcv step played the role of a safeguard against the fake signals .",
    "as table [ t2 ] depicted , the mean training accuracies for the original and permuted data showed similar behavior for the original and permuted data , meaning that the selected genes were indeed important for the training data .",
    "thus , the chosen genes in the permutation set should provide little prediction power for the tuning and testing data .",
    "hence , the validation sets selected large tuning parameter values driving all the patients with no decision for many of the 50 replications for @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this did not happen for @xmath112 since the sample ratio @xmath113 is slightly greater than @xmath114 .",
    "for the rest of the replications with decision making , the mean testing accuracies for the permuted data remained at the level of the sample proportion of sensitive subjects for all three values of @xmath0 , which deviated much from the increasing pattern in the original data .",
    "these suggested that the mcv procedure was able to provide double fail - secure for fake signals . on one hand ,",
    "svm - r placed a cap on the conditional probability of misclassfication and eliminated the replications where the selected genes could not produce results achieving the specified confidence on the validation set .",
    "on the other hand , the mean testing accuracies on the replications passing through the safeguard of tuning sets would be no better than assigning everyone to the sensitive class when there was no real signal .    furthermore , the poor prediction performance of the 50 individual models ended up with unsurprisingly disappointing voting score results for the permuted data , as shown in the lower part of table [ t3 ] .",
    "many of the patients obtained a relatively small value of the voting score and nobody got a score in the range where the original data had the highest accuracy , meaning that the confidence was quite low .",
    "moreover , the stratified ratios of sensitive subjects for different ranges of the voting scores did not show anything insightful other than being around the sample proportion .",
    "the paper introduced a new variable selection procedure based on the property of distance covariance and demonstrated the application through two examples .",
    "the small round blue cell tumors data played a role of a toy example to show that the performance of the proposed method worked well in easy cases . the tcga ovarian cancer data , however , were much more challenging to deal with due to the humongous number of variables and very limited sample size .",
    "the uncertainty of variable selection was discussed through gene selection results using random subsets of the data .",
    "the support vector machine with reject option was used to withhold decision for subjects who were difficult to classify .",
    "an ensemble method of combining models built on random subsets of the data was implemented to assess the prediction performance .",
    "although we had applied these tools ( dcov , svm - r , mcv ) to biomedical data in the paper , we argue that they are quite portable across disciplines .",
    "as shown in table [ t3 ] , a small portion of the model building population got classified for @xmath108 .",
    "is it worthwhile to attempt the classification in such cases ?",
    "it depends on the application , for example differential costs of two types of misclassification , and subjective considerations including quality of life influenced by the treatment , therapy expense and expected survival time .    both the analysis of five fold cross validation and multiple cross validation showed the uncertainty of gene selection results based on different subsets of the data .",
    "the large number of variables that appeared only in a small number of runs suggested noises in the data and the difficulty caused by limited training sample size in the high dimensional scenario .",
    "it could also suggest the conundrum that the `` true '' model consists of a large number of variables with modest effects of which different subsets gives rise to roughly equal prediction ability .",
    "options for further study in this and other difficult problems include allowing the dcov stopping criteria to be modified by some amount @xmath115 , and allowing the greedy variable selection algorithm to be doubly greedy by testing the next best @xmath116 of the remaining variables rather than just the next variable .",
    "it remains to obtain theoretical results to guide exploration in alternate scenarios .",
    "the analysis of random permutation on the response served as both a validation of our results and a discussion of what one is likely to obtain without any true signal . if someone started with an entirely different data set having the same proportions for the two classes with that in the original data but no real signal at all , as what one might get from scrambling , and went through every step , and finally obtained a subgroup of patients with large voting score values , the result was no better than just guessing that everyone was sensitive .",
    "this experiment was also a cautionary tale that if one had not held out validation sets , the analyst could be easily fooled by spurious correlated variables and perfect training accuracy .",

    "<S> variable selection is of increasing importance to address the difficulties of high dimensionality in many scientific areas . in this paper , we demonstrate a property for distance covariance , which is incorporated in a novel feature screening procedure together with the use of distance correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the approach makes no distributional assumptions for the variables and does not require the specification of a regression model , and hence is especially attractive in variable selection given an enormous number of candidate attributes without much information about the true model with the response . </S>",
    "<S> the method is applied to two genetic risk problems , where issues including uncertainty of variable selection via cross validation , subgroup of hard - to - classify cases and the application of a reject option are discussed . </S>"
