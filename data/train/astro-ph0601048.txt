    "in the first paper of this series ( branch et  al . 2005 ; hereafter paper  i ) , the parameterized supernova synthetic  spectrum code was used to fit and interpret a time series of spectra of the well  observed , spectroscopically normal , type  ia ( sn  ia ) sn  1994d . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on near  maximum  light spectra of 24 sne  ia .",
    "light spectra are of particular interest because they are the ones most likely to be obtained , especially for high  redshift sne  ia . in ",
    "2 the spectra are quantified and arranged to illustrate relationships between them . in ",
    "3 to  6 four groups of spectra are discussed , and selected comparisons with synthetic spectra are shown .",
    "results are discussed in  7 .    as in paper  i ,",
    "we confine our attention to optical spectra , from the ca  ii h&k feature in the blue ( @xmath5 ) to the ca  ii infrared triplet ( ca  ii ir3 ) in the red ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the 24 spectra selected for study were obtained within three days of @xmath7band maximum light [ which occurs about 18  days after explosion ( vacca & leibungut ( 1996 ) ] , a time interval short enough that spectroscopic evolution is not strong , yet long enough to allow some events of special interest to be included .",
    "all spectra have been corrected for the redshifts of the parent galaxies .",
    "the original spectra have a range of slopes , owing to intrinsic differences , differences in the amount of reddening by interstellar dust , and observational error . in this paper , because we are interested only in the spectral features , and not in the underlying continuum slopes , the spectra are tilted by multiplying the flux by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 chosen to make the flux peaks near 4600  and 6300  equally high .",
    "the tilting makes it much easier to compare the spectral features .",
    "the events of the sample are listed in table  1 , together with parameters to be discussed below .",
    "various ways of arranging the spectra according to measurements of selected features were explored .",
    "the arrangement shown in figure  1 appears to be useful .",
    "the 75  parameter is the equivalent width of the absorption near 5750 , usually attributed to si  ii 5972 , and 10  is that of the stronger absorption near 6100 , produced by si  ii 6355 .",
    "( because of the presence of emission features , these are equivalent ",
    "width_like _ quantities rather than true equivalent widths . )",
    "the wavelength limits of integration are chosen by eye in the same way as they are for measuring the  parameter , which is the ratio of the fractional depths of these two absorptions ( nugent et  al .",
    "1995 ) , and the flux used as the divisor of the intregral is the mean of the fluxes at the wavelength limits . the ratio of 75  to 10  is correlated with , but not equal to , . for our present purpose of arranging the spectra ,",
    "the measurement errors are not important , even though the fractional error of 75  is large when 75  is small .    plotting 75  against 10",
    "illustrates the relationships according to only two spectral features . to quantify the relationships over a broader wavelength range",
    ", the spectra were interpolated onto a standard wavelength grid of 2  separation , and for each pair of spectra the @xmath10like figure of merit formed from the logarithmic flux differences between 3700 and 6500  ( or as much of this interval as possible ) was minimized by scaling the flux and varying the tilt ( appendix  a ) .",
    "the results identify the nearest neighbor of each event . in figure  1 , a single  headed arrow points to a nearest neighbor ( e.g. , sn  2002bf is the nearest neighbor of sn  1984a ) and a double  headed arrow connects events that are mutual nearest neighbors .    in  3 to ",
    "6 four groups of spectra , denoted by different symbols in figure  1 , are considered .",
    "the group assignments were made on the basis of figure  1 , as well as on the appearance ( depth , width , and shape ) of the 6100  absorption feature . some comparisons with synthetic spectra are shown , and line identifications are discussed .",
    "figure  2 shows spectra of seven sne  ia that are tightly clustered in figure  1 and have similar 6100  absorptions , not only in equivalent width but also in shape .",
    "other features , even weak ones , also are similar .",
    "these will be referred to as `` core  normal '' sne  ia .",
    "the only conspicuous difference among them is the strong high  velocity ca  ii ir3 absorption near 8000  in sn  2001el .    in branch",
    "( 2003 ) and in paper  i ,  fits to the spectra of two core  normals , sn  1998aq and sn  1994d , were presented and discussed .",

    "normals then it should be much stronger in cooler sn  1991bg  like events , which is not the case",
    ". lines of c  ii also are not used , because if present at maximum light they are weak and difficult to confirm [ although they appear to be present at maximum light in at least sn  1998aq ( branch et  al .",

    "3 the spectrum of sn  1994d is compared with two synthetic spectra . as usual , the blackbody continuum of  makes the synthetic spectrum too high from about 6500  to 7800 .",
    "( the continuum of sne  ia can not be modeled as a single blackbody curve , but an attempt to model the exact continuum shape at the  level of analysis would be an unrewarding fitting exercise . )",
    "one synthetic spectrum includes hv  fe  ii , detached at 16,000  , and the other does not .",
    "the main effect of hv  fe  ii is produced by two lines of multiplet  42 , 5018 and 4924 .",
    "( the third line of the multiplet , 5169 , is in this case overwhelmed by si  ii absorption . ) in sn  1994d and most other events of the sample , an absorption near 4430 , which we believe to be produced by si  iii 4550 , is not well fitted because the si  iii synthetic absorption is too blue .",
    "the fit could be improved by lowering  and slightly detaching all ions other than si  iii , but this would not help us to understand the discrepancy so we have refrained from doing it . because the synthetic spectra usually are too high in the red , and because of the presence in some spectra of the telluric absorption near 7600 , it is difficult to know how to fit the absorption produced by o  i 7773 ( and mg  ii 7890 ) , so little significance should be attached to the fitting parameters used for o  i.    in figure  4 the spectrum of sn  2001el is compared with a synthetic spectrum in which hv  ca  ii has a high optical depth ( @xmath13 , compared to @xmath14 to 5 for other core  normals ) , a high value of  = 12,000  , and a maximum velocity of 30,000  .",
    "the high value of  makes the absorption flat and extend to the maximum velocity .",
    "this fit is not unique , but it demonstrates that hv  ca  ii can account for the feature .",
    "polarization observations indicate that asymmetry , not taken into account in , affects hv  ca  ii line formation in sn  2001el ( wang et al .",
    "2003 , kasen et  al .",
    "the best fit for sn  2001el is obtained with a hv  fe  ii optical depth that is the highest among the core ",
    "since sn  2001el has strong hv  ca  ii absorption , this is regarded as support for the hv  fe  ii identification .",
    "the normality of all features _ not _ affected by hv  ca  ii and hv  fe  ii indicates that the pv spectrum of sn  2001el is very much like those of the other core  normals .",
    "most of the spectral features of the core ",
    "normals have established line identifications .",
    "ions whose presence is considered to be definite are pv si  ii , s  ii , ca  ii , o  i , mg  ii , fe  iii , and hv ca  ii .",
    "co  ii and si  iii are probable , while ni  ii is possible , but difficult to establish .",
    "we will return to the issue of hv  fe  ii below .",
    "the issue of c  ii will be addressed in paper  iii ( in preparation ) on premaximum spectra .",
    "a few of the weak features of the core ",
    "normals are not reproduced by the  spectra .",
    "possible identifications of the weak absorptions near 5500  and 5150  ( seen most clearly in figure  3 ) are si  iii 5740 and co  ii 5311 , respectively .",
    "the weak absorptions near 4150  and 4550  ( see figure  2 ) remain unidentified ( but see  7 on the 4550  absorption ) .",
    "figure  5 shows the spectrum of the core  normal sn  1994d ( for comparison ) and the spectra of seven sne  ia that are spectroscopically normal in the traditional sense that their strongest spectral features are the usual ones , rather than the conspicuous fe  iii features of sn  1991 t or the blue ti  ii trough of sn  1991bg .",
    "however , these seven `` broad  line '' sne  ia have 6100  absorptions that are broader and deeper than those of the core ",
    "normals , which puts them to the right of the core ",
    "normals in figure  1 .",
    "the spectra of sn  1992a and sn  1981b are not very different from core  normal , but their lines are broader , e.g. , notice the lack of resolution in the absorption complex from 4600  to 5100 .",
    "therefore , we regard sn  1992a and sn  1981b as small steps from the core in the direction of sn  1984a .",
    "the spectra of figure  5 do not appear to comprise a simple one  dimensional sequence .",
    "in sn  2002bf the absorption near 7500is broad and shallow . sn",
    "2001ay has a weak ca  ii ir3 absorption and steep pieces of spectra near 4000  and 4200 .",
    "[ extreme photometric peculiarities of sn  2001ay are discussed by howell & nugent ( 2004 ) . ]",
    "the fitting parameters for the broad  line sne  ia are in table  3 .",
    "the ions are the same as for the core ",
    "reasonable fits were obtained with  = 12,000  , a typical value for core - normals , and higher values of : 2000  for both pv and hv ions , or higher as indicated in table  3 . for consistency with the modeling of the core ",
    "normals , pv and hv components were used for ca  ii , but these broad ca  ii features also can be fitted as single high  components , so the ca  ii fitting parameters are far from uniquely determined .    in figure  6 the spectrum of the moderately broad  line sn  2002bo",
    "is compared with two synthetic spectra .",
    "hv  fe  ii , with a high optical depth of 1.5 , affects the synthetic spectrum in several places . in figure  7 sn  1984a is compared with synthetic spectra in which si  ii has  = 5000  and a maximum velocity of 25,000  .",
    "the quality of these two fits is about the same as for the core  normals .",
    "line identifications in the broads are the same as in the core",
    " normals . given the non  uniqueness of  fits ( e.g. , to an extent ,",
    "lowering  can be compensated by raising the optical depth ) , most of the differences between the optical depths used for the broads and the core ",
    "normals are not necessarily significant .",
    "figure  8 shows spectra of the core  normal sn  1990n and five `` cool '' sne  ia , four of which have a conspicuous absorption trough from about 4000 to 4400 , due in part to pv ti  ii ( filippenko et  al . 1992a ; mazzali et  al .",
    "1997 ; garnavich et  al .",
    "sn  1989b , on the other hand , is spectroscopically normal in the traditional sense , and not far from core  normal , but its 6100  absorption is deeper than in the core  normals .",
    "its 10  value is similar to that of sn  1981b , which is one of the broad  line events of  4 , but the features of sn  1989b are better resolved than those of sn  1981b .",
    "notice , for example , the well resolved region between 4600  and 5100  in sn  1989b .",
    "the 6100  absorption of sn  1989b is almost identical to that of sn  1986 g . for these reasons , we regard sn  1989b as a small step from the core in the direction of sn  1991bg  like spectra , and it is included with the cools even though it does not have the blue absorption trough .",
    "the fitting parameters for the cool sne  ia are in table  4 .",
    "sn  1989b can be fitted with parameters that differ only mildly from those of the core  normals . for the others of figure  8 ,",
    "the pv excitation temperature is lowered from 10,000 to 7000  k in view of the development of ti  ii lines , which require low temperature .",
    "in addition to ti  ii , five more ions , na  i , mg  i , ca  i , sc  ii , and cr  ii , are introduced .",
    "garnavich et  al .",
    "( 2004 ) used mg  i and ca  i in their study of sn  1999by , and sc  ii also is plausible at low temperature .",
    "( sc  ii lines appear in sne  ii when they become sufficiently cool . )",
    "si  iii and fe  iii require high temperature so they are not used for the cools .    the spectrum of sn  1986 g can not be well fitted with the precepts that were adopted for the core  normals ; when the 6100  absorption is fitted , the 5750  absorption , which is strong in the observed spectrum , hardly appears in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "a plausible solution is to impose a maximum velocity on si  ii . in figure  9 the spectrum of sn  1986 g",
    "is compared with a synthetic spectrum in which si  ii has a maximum velocity of 15,000  and a high optical depth of 100 . owing to the maximum velocity , the 6100  absorption saturates , and owing to the high optical depth , the 5750absorption appears .",
    "it has been suggested ( garnavich et  al .",
    "2004 ) that ti  ii may contribute to the 5750  absorption in sn  1991bg  like spectra , but we find that when the ti  ii optical depth is chosen to fit the blue trough , ti  ii makes no significant contribution to the 5750absorption .",
    "( if the ti  ii optical depth is raised , or an improbably high value of  is used , an absorption due to ti  ii lines does appear near , but not near enough , to the 5750  absorption . ) on the basis of detailed spectrum calculations with the phoenix code ( baron et  al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) , s.  bongard et  al .",
    "( in preparation ) also conclude that ti  ii makes no contribution to the 5750  absorption .",
    "again , a plausible solution is to impose a maximum velocity on si  ii .",
    "this is shown in figure  10 for sn  1991bg ; in the synthetic spectrum the si  ii maximum velocity is 14,000  and the optical depth is 200 .    in view of the large number of ions that may be present , line identifications in the cools ( other than sn  1989b ) are a challenge .",
    "si  ii , ca  ii , mg  ii , ca  ii , and ti  ii can be regarded as definite .",

    "as shown in figures  9 and 10 , cr  ii , sc  ii , mg  i , ca  i , na  i , co  ii , and ni  ii can be combined to obtain reasonable fits ; all of these ions are plausible , but none are definite .",

    "the value of  is 1000  except where indicated otherwise in the table . in figure  13 the spectrum of sn  1999ee",
    "is compared to a synthetic spectrum .",
    "the ions used are the same as in the core normals , but with high values of  = 4000  for hv  fe  ii and 6000  for o  i and hv  ca  ii .",
    "figure  11 shows that the spectra of sn  1999ee , sn  1999aw , and sn  2000cx have many similarities at wavelengths longer than about 4300 .",
    "however , compared to sn  1999ee and sn  1999aw , sn  2000cx is strongly depressed from about 3800  to 4200 . in figure  14 the spectrum of sn  2000cx",
    "is compared to a synthetic spectrum in which si  ii is mildly detached at 15,000  . as in branch et  al .",
    "( 2004a ) , hv  ti  ii is used to provide blocking in the blue , and to account for the sharp flux peak near 4150 .",
    "branch et  al . were unable to suggest an identification for the distinct absorption feature near 4530 , except for hv  h@xmath15 , which would be surprising .",
    "however , as shown in figure  15 , we now realize that hv  cr  ii can account for this feature . if the hv  ti  ii identification is correct , then hv  cr  ii , at practically the same detachment velocity , is a more plausible identification than h@xmath15 . in the synthetic spectrum of figure  14 hv v  ii also is introduced , but its main effect is in a crowded spectral region and the identification is not definite .",
    "sn  1991 t may be a continuation of the sequence shown in figure  11 ; e.g. , it bears some resemblance to sn  1999aw , although its ca  ii and si  ii features are weaker . as further discussed in  7 , even though sn  1991 t and sn  2002cx are mutual nearest neighbors spectroscopically , in several respects they are quite different",
    ". it may be that the only thing these two have in common is a high temperature .",
    "the high degree of spectral homogeneity among the core ",
    "normals suggests that they result from a standard , repeatable sn  ia explosion mechanism that does not produce spatially large composition inhomogeneities near the characteristic photospheric velocity of 12,000  ( thomas et  al .",
    "the strong hv  ca  ii of sn  2001el may involve a spatially large structure near 20,000  ( kasen et  al .",
    "2003 ; kasen & plewa 2005 ) . on the other hand , the features attributed to hv  fe",
    "ii are only mildly enhanced in sn  2001el and rather homogeneous in the others , suggesting that weak hv  fe  ii is `` natural '' in sne  ia , in the sense that it does not require unusual high  velocity structures ( hflich , wheeler , & thielemann 1998 , lentz et  al .",
    "2001b ) . weak hv  ca  ii also is ubiquitous ( mazzali et  al .",
    "2005b ) .    based on previous work ( branch 1987 ; benetti et  al .",
    "2004 ) we expected to fit the broad  line sne  ia with high values of , but better fits were obtained by holding  constant at 12,000  , a typical value for the core ",
    "normals , and using increased  values .",
    "this may be a consequence of nuclear burning extending to higher velocity in the broads than in the core ",
    "normals ( lentz et  al . 2001a ; benetti et al .",
    "2004 ; stehle et  al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "although the composition structures of the cools surely differ from those of the core  normals ( e.g. , the low luminosity requires a low mass of @xmath16ni ) , the immediate reason for the spectroscopic differences appears to be the lower temperature .",
    "the blue trough in cools , usually referred to as the ti  ii trough , is produced not only by ti  ii , but also by other ions that appear at low temperature .",
    "ti  ii is not significant for the 5750  absorption .",
    "the 5750absorption of the cools can be accounted for in terms of a high si  ii optical depth together with a maximum si  ii velocity .",
    "this is a plausible way to simultaneously fit these two absorptions while explaining why  and the ratio of 75  to 10  go the wrong way with temperature ( i.e. , increasing with falling temperature ) , considering that the lower level of 5972 is the upper level of 6355 .",
    "if correct , this maximum velocity would indicate that in the cools nuclear burning extends only to unusually low velocities , near 15,000  .    in most of the shallow ",
    "silicon sne  ia the spectral features appear to be produced by the same ions as in the core ",
    "normals , although the optical depths are quite different , especially in sn  1991 t and sn  2002cx .",
    "most of the differences from core ",
    "normals may be caused by a higher temperature . like sn  2001el among the core ",
    "normals , sn  1999ee provides support for the hv  fe  ii identification .",
    "the cause of the depression of the spectra of sn  2000cx in the blue from about 3800  to 4200  appears to be extra hv line blocking .",
    "if hv ti  ii is present , then hv  cr  ii is a more plausible identification than hv h@xmath15 ( branch et  al .",
    "2004a ) for the 4530  absorption in sn  2000cx .",
    "as noted in  3 , a less distinct absorption appears near 4550  even in the core ",
    "normals ; hv cr  ii is a possibility .",
    "one of the most interesting issues that can be addressed by studies of this kind is whether sne  ia have a continuous distribution of properties , or consist of discrete subgroups . on the whole , we have a sense of continuity .",
    "sn  1992a and sn  1981b may be small steps from the core in the direction of sn  1984a ; sn  1989b may be a step in the direction of sn  1986 g and sn  1991bg ; sn  1999ee may be a step in the direction of sn  1991 t .",
    "if the distribution is continuous , then exactly how the boundaries of the core  normal group are defined is not important .",
    "the cools stand apart from the others in figure  1 , but this in itself does not establish that they differ in kind from the others . as noted by hatano et  al . ( 2002 ) and hflich et  al . (",
    "2002 ) , there is a temperature threshold below which , owing to abrupt changes in key ionization ratios , line optical depths change abruptly ( hatano et  al .",
    "therefore , the temperature interval required to go from sn  1989b through sn  1986 g to sn  1991bg  like events may be narrow .",
    "sn  1991bg  like events also are quite subluminous , but especially in the @xmath7 band , which is strongly blocked by the blue trough . similarly , there is a temperature threshold above which fe  iii features become conspicuous ( hatano et  al .",
    "most sne  ia may be variations on the basic core  normal theme , with the diversity reflecting differences of degree , rather than differences of kind .",
    "evidence recently has been presented that in terms of stellar population age there are two sn  ia groups of roughly equal size , one from a young ( @xmath17 years ) population and another from another from an older ( @xmath18  gyr ) population ( mannucci et  al .",
    "2005a ; scannapieco & bildsten 2005 ; mannucci , della valle , & panagia 2005b ) .",
    "however , we see no basis for splitting the sne  ia of our sample into two groups of roughly equal size",
    ". it may be that there are two different binary  star evolution paths to sne  ia , one requiring a short time and the other a long time , but with the two paths producing similar outcomes , i.e. , carbon  oxygen white dwarfs that explode as they approach the chandrasekhar mass .",
    "the one event of our sample that does seem to be different in kind is sn  2002cx , which we have placed in the shallow  silicon group . like sn  1991 t it had conspicuous fe  iii lines , but unlike sn  1991 t it did not have a slow light  curve decline rate and it was subluminous ( li  et  al .",

    "silicon sn  2000cx , both of which have strong hv features , suggests that hv and pv are somewhat independent ( with hv  fe  ii and weak hv  ca  ii being ubiquitous and natural , as discussed above ) .",
    "an interesting issue for further study is how much of the photometric diversity of sne  ia is caused by hv features ( which may not correlate with luminosity ) .",
    "another issue is whether the strong hv blue line blocking of sn  2000cx occurs only in the shallow ",
    "silicon group .",
    "it is clear that strong hv  ca  ii ir3 absorption occurs not only in the core ",
    "normal sn  2001el but also in the shallows .",
    "our study is complementary to that of benetti et  al .",
    "( 2005 ; hereafter be05 ) , who did not consider the strenths of spectral features .",
    "sixteen events of our sample were included in the study of be05 , who assigned sne  ia to three groups on the basis of absolute magnitude ( @xmath20 ) ; light  curve decline rate ( 15 ; phillips 1993 ) ; the blueshift of the 6100  absorption 10 days after maximum [ 10 ; branch & van  den  bergh 1993 ] ; the rate at which the 6100  absorption drifts to the red [ ; be05 ] ; and . with a few borderline exceptions ( sn  1989b and sn  1992a )",
    ", our cools corresponds to the be05 faint group , which is to be expected since both temperature and luminosity are controlled mainly by the @xmath16ni mass .",
    "our broad  line group corresponds to the be05 hvg ( high temporal  velocity gradient ) group .",
    "this also makes sense because broad 6100  absorption requires high si  ii optical depth over a substantial velocity range , which makes it possible for the absorption minimum to shift appreciably with time .",
    "the broads appear to have thicker silicon layers than the core ",
    "our core normals and shallows correspond to the be05 lvg ( low temporal  velocity gradient ) group .",
    "the lower velocity range over which si  ii has a high optical depth permits only a smaller shift in the absorption minimum with time .",
    "polarization observations ( wang et  al . 2001 ; howell et  al . 2001 ;",
    "wang et  al . 2003 ; leonard et  al . 2005 ) show that some spectral features are affected by asymmetric structures",
    ". a straightforward way to rule out asymmetry as the sole cause of the differences between groups of sne  ia would be to demonstrate a correlation with parent galaxy type ( be05 ) or other indicators of the parent  galaxy population ( gallagher et  al .",
    "if asymmetry were the sole cause of sn  ia differences , sn  ia subtypes would not correlate with galaxy types .",
    "but , in fact , there are correlations and emerging correlations .",
    "sn  1991bg  like events tend to occur in older populations ( howell 2001 ) . in the be05 sample the mean host galaxy morphological type ( the t  type )",
    "was found to increase from the faint to hvg to lvg groups .",
    "similarly , for our sample the mean t  type increases from cools to core ",
    "normals to broads to shallows , but the statistics are too poor to allow definite conclusions .    the expected rapid increase in the number of well observed sne  ia in the near future ( e.g. , wood  vasey et  al . 2004 ) will allow the relationships among sne  ia to be clarified .",
    "we expect that our paper  iii ( in preparation ) , on premaximum spectra , also will clarify the view presented here .",
    "we are grateful to all observers who have provided spectra .",
    "this work has been supported by nsf grants ast-0204771 and ast-0506028 , and nasa ltsa grant nng04gd36 g .",
    "in order to quantify difference in spectral features we use the scaled  tilted spectrum expressed by flux values @xmath21 for wavelengths @xmath22 which are parameterized as @xmath23 the @xmath24 values are the observed spectral flux values of spectrum @xmath25 .",
