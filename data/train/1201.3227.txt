    "in many practical engineering situations , the dynamical behaviour of the system at stake can be modeled as a switching system like the one represented in equation ( [ eq - switching ] ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a set of matrices , and the function @xmath2 is called the _ switching signal_. as a few examples , applications ranging from viral disease treatment optimization ( @xcite ) to multi - hop networks control ( @xcite ) , or trackability of autonomous agents in sensor networks ( @xcite ) have been modeled with switching systems .",
    "one of the central problems in the study of switching systems is their stability : do all the trajectories @xmath3 tend to zero when @xmath4 whatever switching law @xmath5 occurs ?",
    "the answer is given by the _ joint spectral radius _ of the set @xmath6 which is defined as    @xmath7    this quantity is independent of the norm used in ( [ eq-def.jsr ] ) , and is smaller than one if and only if the system is stable .",
    "see @xcite for a recent survey on the topic .",
    "even though it is known to be very hard to compute , in recent years much effort has been devoted to approximating this quantity , because of its importance in applications .",
    "one of the most successful families of techniques to approximate it makes use of convex optimization methods , like sum - of - squares , or semidefinite programming ( @xcite ) .",
    "other methods have been proposed to tackle the stability problem ( e.g. variational methods ( @xcite ) , or iterative methods ( @xcite ) ) , but a great advantage of the former methods is that they offer a simple criterion that can be checked with the help of the powerful tools available for solving convex programs , and they often come with a guaranteed accuracy . + as an example , the following simple set of lmis is probably the first one that has been proposed in the literature in order to solve the problem : @xmath8 it appears that if these equations have a solution @xmath9 then the function @xmath10 is a common quadratic lyapunov function , meaning that this function decreases , whatever switching signal occurs .",
    "this proves the following folklore theorem :    if a set of matrices @xmath1 is such that the equations ( [ eq-lyap.cq.sdp ] ) have a solution @xmath9 then this set is stable .    starting with the lmis ( [ eq-lyap.cq.sdp ] ) , many researchers have provided other methods , based on semidefinite programming , for proving the stability of a switching system . in all these methods ,",
    "the stability criterion consists in verifying a set of _ lyapunov inequalities , _ which we now describe .",
    "the different methods amount to write a set of equations , which are parameterized by the values of the entries of the matrices in @xmath11 if these equations have a solution , then it implies that the set @xmath6 is stable .",
    "we call a _ lyapunov function _ any continuous , positive , and homogeneous function @xmath12    given a switching system of the shape ( [ eq - switching ] ) , a _ lyapunov inequality _ is a quantified inequality of the shape : @xmath13 where the functions @xmath14 are lyapunov functions , and @xmath15 is a particular product of matrices in @xmath11    for instance , the relations ( [ eq-lyap.cq.sdp ] ) represent a lyapunov inequality , because of the well known property @xmath16 they represent the fact that the ellipsoid corresponding to the matrix @xmath17 is mapped into itself .",
    "we call such lyapunov inequalities with sdp matrices and semidefinite inequalities _ ellipsoidal lyapunov inequalities .",
    "_    [ remark - approx ] it is important to note that the utility of such lmis goes further than the simple stability criterion : by applying them to the _ scaled _ set of matrices @xmath18 one can actually derive an upper bound @xmath19 on the joint spectral radius , thanks to the homogeneity of the definition ( [ eq-def.jsr ] ) : take @xmath19 the minimum @xmath20 such that the scaled set ( [ eq - scaled - set ] ) is stable .",
    "+ this allows to provide an estimate of the quality of performance of a particular set of lmis , as the maximal real number @xmath21 such that for any set of matrices @xmath22 in particular , it is known ( @xcite ) that the estimate @xmath19 obtained with the set of equations [ eq-lyap.cq.sdp ] satisfies @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the dimension of the matrices .",
    "the reason for which more lmi criteria have been introduced in the literature cited above is that for some other sets of lmis , one can prove that the value @xmath21 is larger than @xmath25    in the recent paper @xcite , the authors have presented a framework in which all these methods find a common natural generalization .",
    "the idea is that a set of lyapunov inequalities describes a set of switching signals for which the trajectory remains stable .",
    "thus , a valid set of lmis must cover all the possible switching signals , and provide a valid stability proof for all of these signals .",
    "one contribution of @xcite is to provide a way to represent a set of lmis with a directed labeled graph which represents all the stable switching signals ( as implied by the lmis ) .",
    "thus , one just has to check that all the possible switching signals are represented in the graph , in order to decide whether the corresponding set of lmis is a sufficient condition for stability .",
    "we now formally describe the construction and the result :    in the following , @xmath6 can represent a set of matrices or the alphabet corresponding to this set of matrices .",
    "also , for any alphabet @xmath26 we note @xmath27 ( resp .",
    "@xmath28 ) the set of all words on this alphabet ( resp .",
    "the set of words of length @xmath29 ) .",
    "finally , for a word @xmath30 we note @xmath31 the product corresponding to @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "+ we represent a set of lyapunov inequalities on a directed labeled graph @xmath34 .",
    "each node of this graph corresponds to a lyapunov function @xmath35 , and each edge is labeled by a finite product of matrices , i.e. , by a word from the set @xmath36    as illustrated in figure  [ fig-node.arc ] , for any word @xmath37 and any lyapunov inequality of the shape @xmath38 we add an arc going from node @xmath39 to node @xmath40 labeled with the word @xmath41 ( the _ mirror _",
    "@xmath41 of a word @xmath42 is the word obtained by reading @xmath43 starting from the end ) .",
    "so , there are as many nodes in the graph as there are different functions @xmath44 and as many arcs as there are inequalities .",
    "the reason for this construction is that there is a direct way of checking on @xmath45 whether the set of lyapunov inequalities implies the stability .",
    "before to present it , we need a last definition :    [ def - path - complete ] given a directed graph @xmath46 whose arcs are labeled with words from the set @xmath27 , we say that the graph is _ path - complete _ , if for any finite word @xmath47 of any length @xmath48 ( i.e. , for all words in @xmath27 ) , there is a directed path in @xmath45 such that the word obtained by concatenating the labels of the edges on this path contains the word @xmath47 as a subword .",
    "we are now able to state the criterion for validity of a set of lmis :    [ thm-path.complete.implies.stability](@xcite ) consider a set of lyapunov inequalities with @xmath49 different labels , and its corresponding graph @xmath50 if @xmath45 is path - complete , then , the lyapunov inequalities are a valid criterion for stability , i.e. , for any finite set of matrices @xmath51 which satisfies these inequalities , the corresponding switching system ( [ eq - switching ] ) is stable .",
    "the graph represented in figure [ fig - hscc ] is path - complete : one can check that every word can be read on this graph . as a consequence ,",
    "the set of equations ( [ eq - hscc ] ) is a valid condition for stability .",
    "@xmath52    in this paper , we investigate the converse direction of theorem [ thm-path.complete.implies.stability ] , and answer the question `` are there other sets of lmis , which do not correspond to path - complete graphs , but are sufficient conditions for stability ? ''",
    "we provide a negative answer to this question .",
    "thus , we characterize the sets of lmis that are a sufficient condition for stability . of course , by remark [ remark - approx ]",
    "above , we not only characterize the lyapunov inequalities that allow to prove stability , but we also characterize the valid lmis which allow to approximate the joint spectral radius . another motivation for studying lmi criteria for stability is that it appeared recently that much more quantities that are relevant for the asymptotic behaviour of switching systems can also be approximated thanks to lmis .",
    "this is the case for instance of the lyapunov exponent ( @xcite ) , the p - radius ( @xcite ) , ...    thus , we need to show that for any non - path - complete graph , there exists a set of matrices which is not stable , but yet satisfies the corresponding equations . this is not an easy task a priori , because we need to implicitly construct a counterexample , without knowning the graph , but just with the information that it is not path - complete .",
    "moreover , we not only have to construct the unstable set of matrices which is a counterexample , but we need to implicitly build the solution @xmath53 to the lyapunov inequalities , in order to show that the set satisfies the lyapunov inequalities .",
    "we split the proof in two steps : we first study a particular case of non - path - complete graphs : for these graphs there are only two different characters ( i.e. two different matrices in the set ) ; there is only one node ; and @xmath54 self loops , each one with a different word of length @xmath55 ( @xmath55 is arbitrary ) .",
    "the proof is simpler for this particular case , and we feel it gives a fair intuition on the reasoning .",
    "+ the rest of the paper is as follows : in section [ section - preliminaries ] we first present the basic construction which lies at the core of our proofs , and then we present the proof for the particular case . in section [ section - main ]",
    "we prove our result in its full generality .",
    "we then show that it implies that recognizing if a set of lmis is a valid criterion for stability is pspace - complete . in section [ section - conclusion ]",
    "we conclude and point out some possible further work .",
    "we restrict ourselves to sets of two matrices for the sake of clarity and conciseness . recall that we want to prove that if a graph is not path - complete , it is not a valid criterion for stability , meaning that there must exist a set of matrices that satisfies the corresponding lyapunov inequalities , but yet , is not stable .",
    "our goal in this subsection is to describe a simple construction that will allow us to build such a set of matrices in our main theorems .",
    "if a graph is not path - complete , there is a certain word @xmath43 which can not be read on the graph .",
    "let us fix @xmath56 i.e. , @xmath24 is the length of this word plus one ( @xmath24 will be the dimension of our matrices ) .",
    "we propose a simple construction of a set of matrices such that all long products which are not zero must contain the product @xmath57    given a word @xmath58 we call @xmath59 the set of @xmath60-matrices @xmath61 such that the @xmath62 entry of @xmath63 is equal to one if and only if    * @xmath64 for @xmath65 *   or @xmath66 and @xmath67    more clearly , @xmath59 is the only set of binary matrices whose sum is the adjacency matrix of the cycle on @xmath24 nodes , and such that for all @xmath68,$ ] the @xmath39th edge of this cycle is in the graph corresponding to @xmath69 the last edge being in the graph corresponding to @xmath70 figure [ fig - sigmaomega ] provides a visual representation of the set @xmath71      we now prove a particular case of our main result : we restrict our attention to ellipsoidal lyapunov inequalities , and to graphs with a single node with @xmath72 self - loops labeled with words of length @xmath73 that is , the lyapunov inequalities express the constraints that all but one of the products of length @xmath55 leave a particular ellipsoid invariant . the corresponding graph is depicted in figure [ fig - particular ] , and the lyapunov inequalities are of the shape ( here we have taken @xmath74 as the missing word ) : @xmath75    we will make use of a well - known result from the seminal paper of @xcite :    [ thm - ando - shih](@xcite ) let @xmath76 be a set of matrices . if @xmath77 then the matrices in @xmath6 leave invariant a common ellipsoid ; that is , equations ( [ eq-lyap.cq.sdp ] ) have a solution .",
    "we also need the easy lemma characterizing the main property of our construction @xmath57    [ lem - subproduct ] any nonzero product in @xmath78 contains @xmath31 as a subproduct .    _ proof .",
    "_ since the matrices have binary entries , a nonzero product corresponds to a path in the corresponding graph .",
    "a path of length more than @xmath24 must contain a cycle , and there is only one cycle .",
    "finally , a path of length @xmath79 must contain a cycle starting at node @xmath80 which corresponds to @xmath57@xmath81    we are now in position to prove the particular case :    let @xmath43 be a word of length @xmath55 on @xmath82 letters , and @xmath83 be the set of all words of length @xmath55 except @xmath84 the graph with one node and @xmath54 self - loops , whose labels are all the words in @xmath85 is not a sufficient condition for stability .",
    "indeed , the set @xmath59 described above satisfies the corresponding lmis , but is not stable .    _ proof .",
    "_ we consider the above construction @xmath71 it is obvious that @xmath86 ( because @xmath87 in fact @xmath88 but this is not relevant for the discussion here ) .",
    "+ thus , we have to show that all products in the set @xmath89 share a common invariant ellipsoid . in order to do that",
    ", we will show that @xmath90 this fact together with theorem [ thm - ando - shih ] implies that the system ( [ eq - particular ] ) has a solution .",
    "we * claim * that any nonzero product @xmath15 of length @xmath91 only has nonzero entries of the shape @xmath92 @xmath93 this is because any edge in the graph is of the shape @xmath94 so a path of length @xmath95 must be of the shape @xmath96 also , by construction of @xmath97 the only product @xmath15 of length @xmath55 such that @xmath98 is @xmath57    now , suppose by contradiction that there exists a long nonzero product of matrices in @xmath99 @xmath100 any nonzero entry in this matrix corresponds to a path of length @xmath101 of the shape @xmath102 ( where an arrow represents a jump of length @xmath55 corresponding to a multiplication by a matrix in @xmath103 ) . since we suppose that there are arbitrarily long products , it means that for some @xmath104 @xmath105 and @xmath106 so that @xmath31 must be in @xmath107 a contradiction .",
    "let us now consider a general non - path - complete graph , and prove that some sets of matrices satisfy the corresponding equations , but fail to have jsr smaller than one .",
    "we will start by studying another family of lyapunov functions .",

    "let us consider a non - path - complete graph @xmath175 and the solution provided by theorem [ theo - stab - implies - pc ] above : we have a set of matrices @xmath176 and nonnegative vectors @xmath177 such that @xmath178 with label @xmath179 @xmath180 in fact , one can see in the proof of theorem [ theo - stab - implies - pc ] that the vectors @xmath155 and matrices @xmath142 have a slightly stronger property : for any matrix @xmath142 and any couple of indices @xmath181 such that @xmath182 we have ( @xmath183 is the @xmath55th vector of the standard basis ) : @xmath184 and , if moreover the edge @xmath62 is in @xmath185 @xmath186    we are now in position to construct our solution : we take @xmath187 i.e. , the transposes of our initial set , as the set of matrices , and we define @xmath188 we claim that these semidefinite positive matrices are a solution to the lyapunov inequalities ( with ellipsoidal lyapunov functions ) . since @xmath189 is not stable , this gives us the required counterexample .",
    "+ indeed , for any edge @xmath190 from ( [ eq - vi - lifted ] ) it is straightforward that @xmath191 @xmath81      _ proof._(sketch ) in the full language problem , one is given a finite state automaton on a certain alphabet @xmath192 and it is asked whether the language it accepts is the language @xmath193 of all the possible words .",
    "it is well known that the full language problem is pspace - complete ( @xcite ) .",
    "a labeled graph corresponds in a straightforward way to a finite state automaton .",
    "our proof works by reduction from the full language problem .",
    "however , in order to reduce this problem to the question of recognizing whether a graph is path - complete , we must be able to transform the automaton into a new one for which all the states are starting and accepting .",
    "we do this by adding a new fake character @xmath194 in the alphabet , and connecting all accepting nodes to all starting nodes , with an edge labeled with @xmath195 now , we make all the nodes starting and accepting , and we ask whether all the words in our new alphabet @xmath196 are accepted in our new automaton . that is , if the obtained graph is path - complete .",
    "one can check that if all words can be read on the graph , then in particular , it is the case of all words starting and ending with the character @xmath195 since these words are exactly of the shape @xmath197 where @xmath43 is accepted by the given automaton , our new automaton generates all the words on @xmath198 if and only if the initial one generated all the words on @xmath11 + in other words , the new graph is path - complete if and only if the initial automaton was accepting all the words on @xmath199 @xmath81"
