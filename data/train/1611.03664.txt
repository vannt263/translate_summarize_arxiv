    "the structure of social networks plays an important role in the collective dynamics taking place in them  @xcite , as exemplified by disease spreading and diffusion of innovation and opinions . in recent years ,",
    "the characterization of social networks in the unprecedented detail has become possible because of the availability of a number of large - scale digital datasets , e.g. , face - to - face interactions  @xcite , emails  @xcite , mobile phone communication  @xcite , online forums  @xcite , social networking services ( sns ) like facebook  @xcite and twitter  @xcite , and even massive multiplayer online games  @xcite .",
    "however , these datasets capture only a part of the whole social network , implying that any conclusions derived from such datasets can not be simply extrapolated to the whole society .",
    "this raises a series of questions : how can one translate conclusions from partial datasets to the whole social network ?",
    "more importantly , what does the whole social network look like ?",
    "the first question has been investigated in terms of sampling biases  @xcite , while the second question is largely unexplored mainly due to the lack of complete datasets .",
    "we expect that some properties of the whole social network might be reflected in the empirical findings from some aspects of the network . by collecting such findings from diverse sources ,",
    "we find several commonly observed features or _ stylized facts _ of social networks  @xcite .",
    "these include broad distributions of local network quantities  @xcite , community structure  @xcite , homophily  @xcite , and intensity - topology correlations  @xcite , etc .",
    "more recently , geographical and/or demographic information of social networks have also been explored  @xcite , which are beyond the scope of this paper . in this paper",
    "we focus on the social network modeling for reproducing stylized facts of social networks .",
    "we first introduce the previous efforts of this line of research : the global picture for social networks has been described by the granovetter s hypothesis of `` strength of weak ties ''  @xcite , indicating that communities of strongly connected nodes are weakly connected to each other .",
    "this picture has been empirically confirmed  @xcite and subsequently produced with computational modeling by considering cyclic and focal closure mechanisms in tie formation  @xcite .",
    "however , it was recently suggested that communities could be overlapping  @xcite in contrast to the picture of separate communities .",
    "this overlapping behavior is mostly due to the multilayer nature of social networks  @xcite , in which each layer may correspond to a certain type of human relationship or context .",
    "this means that an individual can belong to one community in one layer but simultaneously to another community in another layer .",
    "accordingly , dynamical models for multilayer , overlapping community structure have been introduced , while reproducing other stylized facts for local network quantities  @xcite .    there",
    "exist several models that partially reproduce stylized facts  @xcite .",
    "as many of them are dynamic and evolutionary in nature , they tend to take considerable amount of computational time .",
    "more importantly , they are often too complicated for the analytical approach , thus hampering deeper understanding of the consequences of the models .",
    "hence , there is need to take alternative approaches for simpler and easier implementation as well as for the possible analytical treatment , while capturing most of the essential properties of the social networks . to satisfy this need we will here devise a community - based static model to reproduce the stylized facts in social networks by randomly assigning a number of communities to a given set of isolated nodes",
    ". this static model approach of ours is similar to the previous studies such as exponential random graph models ( ergms )  @xcite , stochastic blockmodels  @xcite , and configuration models in network science  @xcite .",
    "for example , while there are many dynamical models leading to the desired degree distribution , the configuration model , where the desired degree distribution is _ a priori _ built in , serves as a reference system .    for our model , we randomly assign a number of communities to a given set of isolated nodes using a few assumptions such that the community size is heterogeneous , and larger communities are assigned with smaller link density and smaller characteristic link weight . only with these few assumptions ,",
    "apparently realistic social network structures are generated showing most stylized facts for a wide range of the parameter space .",
    "it turns out that the social networks can be described by only a few factors , explaining why the stylized facts are so commonly observed .",
    "furthermore , thanks to the random nature of assigning communities to nodes , we can analytically calculate various local network quantities , e.g. , for the assortative mixing , local clustering coefficient , and neighborhood overlap .",
    "hence we expect our community - based static model to serve as a general reference system for the whole social network .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sect : stylized ] , we summarize the observed stylized facts for social networks from diverse sources . then we introduce the community - based static model in section  [ sect : model ] . in section  [",
    "sect : numerical ] , by performing large - scale numerical simulations , we find a wide range of the parameter space in which the stylized facts are reproduced . in section  [",
    "sect : analysis ] , we present the analytical results for local network quantities .",
    "finally , we conclude our work in section  [ sect : conclusion ] .",
    "in table  [ table : summary ] we present a summary of the commonly observed features or _ stylized facts _ in many digital datasets for social networks . these include the statistics of local network quantities and results for the global structure , both of which can be either topological or intensity - related .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us first consider topological quantities .",
    "the degree @xmath0 of a node is the number of its neighbors .",
    "degree distributions @xmath1 in most datasets are found to be broad and overall decreasing  @xcite .",
    "this implies that the most probable degree or the mode of @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath2 , is of the order of @xmath3 , leading to the fact that @xmath2 is much smaller than the average degree @xmath4 .",
    "this stylized fact is however clearly not consistent with our common sense that it is unlikely to find a majority of individuals with only one or few relationships in a society .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained by the channel selection mechanism  @xcite : most datasets for social networks represent only one communication channel or even a part of it , while social interactions generally take place on multiple communication channels , namely , the multiplexity of social networks  @xcite .",
    "since individuals with low degree in one channel can have high degree in another channel , by considering the whole social network , @xmath1 is expected to have a peak at the degree larger than @xmath3 , implying that @xmath2 is of the comparable order of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "such @xmath1 can be called overall peaked , see fig .",
    "1a in  @xcite for example .",
    "this does not necessarily exclude the broadness of @xmath1 .",
    "homophily , the tendency that alike people are attracted to each other , is one of the governing principles of social network formation  @xcite .",
    "one manifestation of homophily is assortativity , i.e. , the tendency that high degree nodes are linked together .",
    "this correlation has been quantified in terms of the assortativity coefficient @xmath5 , which is a pearson correlation coefficient ( pcc ) between degrees of neighboring nodes  @xcite .",
    "many social networks are found to be assortative , e.g. , with @xmath6@xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this is also shown by the increasing behavior of @xmath8 , i.e. , the average degree of neighbors for nodes with degree @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath8 is defined as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the set of @xmath11 s neighbors and @xmath12 is the node @xmath11 s degree .",
    "high clustering is evident in social networks , implying that your neighbor s neighbor is likely to be also your neighbor . for a node @xmath11",
    ", the local clustering coefficient @xmath13 is defined as the number of links between @xmath11 s neighbors , denoted by @xmath14 , divided by the possible maximal number of links between them , i.e. , @xmath15 , as follows : @xmath16 then one can measure the average local clustering coefficient for nodes with degree @xmath0 as @xmath17 the quantity @xmath18 is found to be a decreasing function of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "this finding can be explained by considering the case that the effect of making new neighbors , corresponding to @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci_define ] ) , is typically stronger than that of finding new links between neighbors , in relation to @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ci_define ] ) .",
    "for example , if every new neighbor of a node @xmath11 creates a new link to one of node @xmath11 s existing neighbors , then @xmath20 , leading to @xmath21 .",
    "this behavior can be measured in terms of the pcc between @xmath13 and @xmath22 , which is denoted hereafter as @xmath23 .    at the larger scale ,",
    "social networks have rich community structure .",
    "that is , nodes in communities are densely connected , while nodes between different communities are sparsely connected  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the community size distribution @xmath24 has a heavy tail or power - law form , e.g. , as evidenced in  @xcite .",
    "we remark that in our model @xmath24 will be used as an input rather than as an output of the model .",
    "next , we consider the intensity - related quantities , i.e. , strength @xmath25 and weight @xmath26 .",
    "the weight of a link quantifies the interaction activity between two nodes  @xcite , e.g. , the frequency of contact in communication .",
    "the strength of a node , denoting the activity of the node , has been defined as the sum of weights of links involving the node : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the weight of the link @xmath29 .",
    "the distributions of these quantities , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , are also found to be broad and overall decreasing , implying that individual and interaction activities are heterogeneous  @xcite .",
    "the overall decreasing behavior of @xmath31 can be interpreted as the prevalence of weak links  @xcite in social networks .",
    "in addition , the average strength of nodes as a function of the degree , @xmath32 , is found to be overall increasing  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath32 is defined as @xmath33 this behavior can be measured in terms of the pcc between @xmath34 and @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath35 . combining the peaked @xmath1 and the increasing @xmath32 , we expect @xmath30 to be also peaked .",
    "the overall peaked @xmath30 can be tested in terms of the mode of @xmath30 , denoted by @xmath36 .",
    "the intensities are correlated with topological properties , which can be called intensity - topology correlation or weight - topology correlation as used in  @xcite .",
    "a link - level consequence of intensity - topology correlation can be measured by the average neighborhood overlap for links with weight @xmath26 , denoted by @xmath37 .",
    "the neighborhood overlap of a link is the fraction of common neighbors of neighboring nodes , say @xmath11 and @xmath38 , among all neighbors of those nodes : @xmath39 where @xmath40 denotes the number of common neighbors of nodes @xmath11 and @xmath38 , whose degrees are @xmath22 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "it has been empirically found that the stronger links tend to show larger neighborhood overlap  @xcite , implying that closer friends tend to have more common friends .",
    "we also note that @xmath37 begins to decrease for very large @xmath26 in some cases  @xcite , and that the overall decreasing @xmath37 is found in some collaboration networks  @xcite .",
    "the overall increasing behavior of @xmath37 can be measured in terms of the pcc between @xmath42 and @xmath28 , and it is denoted by @xmath43 .",
    "the intensity - topology correlation emerges at the global scale such that communities of strongly connected nodes are weakly connected to each other  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the granovetter s hypothesis of `` strength of weak ties ''  @xcite . as the granovetterian structure",
    "is maintained by weak links , the network will be disintegrated by removing weak links rather than by removing strong links .",
    "precisely , a link percolation analysis can be applied such that links are removed one by one either from the weakest links ( ascending link removal ) or from the strongest links ( descending link removal ) to see when the network gets disintegrated . in both cases , we may observe the percolation transition at some value of the fraction of removed links @xmath44 .",
    "if the percolation threshold for ascending ( descending ) link removal is denoted by @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) , we expect that @xmath47 is significantly larger than @xmath48 as shown in  @xcite .",
    "it is because the granovetterian structure will be disintegrated earlier for ascending link removal than for descending link removal .",
    "note that @xmath49 does not guarantee the granovetterian structure  @xcite .",
    "the percolation threshold can be determined by measuring the fraction of the largest connected component ( lcc ) @xmath50 and the susceptibility @xmath51 as functions of @xmath44 . here",
    "the susceptibility for the network size @xmath52 is defined as @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the number of connected components of size @xmath25 and the summation is taken over all connected components but the lcc . at the percolation threshold @xmath55 , @xmath50 vanishes and @xmath51 diverges in the thermodynamic limit  @xcite .",
    "finally , we remark that these stylized facts have been deduced mostly from datasets of single communication channels , while the whole social network is multiplex , representing a multiplicity of communication channels . empirical findings in single channel datasets may reflect some properties of the reality , but they may also introduce biases  @xcite . thus , our aim in this paper is to reproduce , in addition to the stylized facts , the expected peaked behavior of @xmath1 and @xmath30 for the whole social network , as listed in table  [ table : summary ] with expected behavior in parenthesis .",
    "in order to devise a community - based static model for stylized facts in social networks , let us consider an undirected weighted network of @xmath52 nodes and @xmath56 communities .",
    "for each community , the community size @xmath57 is drawn from a distribution @xmath24 .",
    "the minimum size of the community is set as @xmath58 , i.e. , a triangle .",
    "the maximum size of the community @xmath59 is set to be @xmath60 that is sufficiently large but not too large for being realistic .",
    "then @xmath57 different nodes are randomly chosen to form a community , where links between them are created with linking probability @xmath61 . here",
    "@xmath61 is a decreasing function of @xmath57 to represent the tendency of link density being sparser for larger communities .",
    "each of these links is assumed to have a positive weight randomly drawn from a distribution @xmath62 with a characteristic weight @xmath63 .",
    "here @xmath63 is a decreasing function of @xmath57 to represent the tendency of weaker ties in larger communities . for these reasons ,",
    "we assume the following functional form for distributions of @xmath64 : @xmath65}{w(g)},\\ w(g)\\equiv w_0 \\left(\\tfrac{g_0}{g}\\right)^\\gamma\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with non - negative exponents @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath69 denotes a normalization constant , and @xmath70 is the heaviside step function .",
    "we take a power - law form for @xmath24 based on the empirical findings in  @xcite .",
    "the power - law form for @xmath61 is also inspired by the observations  @xcite . finally , we take the uniform distribution for @xmath62 within the range of @xmath71 $ ] as no evidence is known for its shape .",
    "other candidates for @xmath62 will be shortly discussed in appendix  [ appendix : pgw ] .",
    "these settings imply that the average number of neighbors due to the community of size @xmath57 is @xmath72 , i.e. , of the order of @xmath73 .",
    "since a membership to the larger community could imply more ties created , it is assumed that @xmath74 .",
    "further , the sum of weights due to those neighbors in the community of size @xmath57 scales with @xmath75 .",
    "this sum decreases with @xmath57 for sufficiently large @xmath68 , meaning that people may spend less time in communication with the members of the larger communities .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig : visualnet ] for the schematic diagram    , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the larger dotted circle indicates the larger community size , and thicker lines indicate larger link weights . ]    since in social networks each node may belong to multiple communities , the network has an overlapping community structure and this is assured here by construction .",
    "moreover , such network can be interpreted in the frame of a multilayer network  @xcite . in our model",
    "each _ layer _ indexed by @xmath57 is defined as a set of links created in communities of the same size @xmath57 .",
    "note that the layers in the real social networks do not have to consist of the communities of the same size .",
    "then , a pair of nodes may be connected by multiple links when they belong to multiple communities , irrespective of whether those communities are in the same layer or not .",
    "however , we reduce multilayer weighted networks generated by our model to single layer weighted networks by assigning a unique weight to each pair of nodes . here",
    "we use the rule of weight aggregation such that a weight @xmath28 for a link @xmath29 is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes a set of @xmath57s for communities in which the link @xmath29 is created , and @xmath80 is the weight of link @xmath29 created in the layer @xmath57 . note that alternative rules for weight aggregation can be used , e.g. , by taking a maximum weight from a set of @xmath80 .",
    "we remark that it is very unlikely for a pair of nodes to belong to multiple communities , which is indeed asymptotically the case as shown in appendix  [ appendix : overlap ] .",
    "hence , links can be divided into exclusive sets according to the community size @xmath57 in which the link is created , implying that @xmath81 for all links .",
    "for numerical simulations , we generate networks of size @xmath82 with @xmath58 and @xmath83",
    ". we also set @xmath84 without loss of generality .",
    "we begin with @xmath52 isolated nodes , to which communities are added sequentially until the average degree reaches a predetermined value , e.g. , @xmath85 .",
    "this in turn determines the total number of communities , @xmath56 .",
    "we first study the effects of @xmath66 and @xmath67 on the topological properties of the generated networks to find the parameter region for reproducing the stylized facts .",
    "then , for a fixed value of @xmath67 within the region for the topological stylized facts , we study the effects of @xmath66 and @xmath68 on the intensity - related properties of generated networks .",

    "<S> the past analyses of datasets for social networks have enabled us to make empirical findings of a number of aspects of human society , yet leaving the structure of the whole social network largely unexplored . for deeper insight into human society </S>",
    "<S> there is either need for more comprehensive datasets or modeling . in order to model the whole social network , we assume that some properties of the network are reflected in empirical findings and are commonly featured as stylized facts of social networks , such as broad distributions of network quantities , existence of communities , assortative mixing , and intensity - topology correlations . </S>",
    "<S> several models have been studied to generate the stylized facts , but so far most of them have focused on the processes or mechanisms behind stylized facts . here </S>",
    "<S> we take an alternative approach by devising a community - based static model for the whole social network , for which we randomly assign a number of communities to a given set of isolated nodes using a few assumptions such that the community size is heterogeneous , and larger communities are assigned with smaller link density and smaller characteristic link weight . only with these few assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> we are able to generate realistic social networks that show most stylized facts for a wide range of parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this in turn can explain why the stylized facts are so commonly observed . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain analytical results for various network quantities that turn out to be comparable with the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the dynamical generative models , our community - based static model is simple to implement and easily scalable . </S>",
    "<S> hence , it can be used as a reference system for further applications . </S>"
