    "the situation is quite different for @xmath586 ( hadron resonances but also the @xmath587-boson ) where @xmath588 is measured ( not as the inverse lifetime but ) as the width of the relativistic breit - wigner which according to is the energy wave function of the gamow vector @xmath589 .",

    "the relativistic gamow kets that span these semigroup representations have the additional attractive feature that they generalize wigner s definition of relativistic stable particles @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the paper was to give a detailed derivation of the properties of vectors which describe relativistic decaying states and resonances .",
    "in contrast to non - relativistic quantum theory , where one considered quasistable particles as unique states characterized by two numbers @xmath595 and @xmath596 which can appear either as a resonance described by a breit - wigner energy distribution or as a decaying particle with an exponential time evolution , relativistic resonances were considered as complicated objects .",
    "most commonly , they were defined in perturbation theory by the propagator using the on - the - mass - shell renormalization scheme and had a mass @xmath597 and an energy dependent width @xmath598 , the definition of which depended upon the renormalization scheme @xcite .",
    "the definition of a resonance by the pole of the relativistic @xmath0-matrix is less arbitrary and characterizes the resonance by a complex pole position @xmath334 , which however does not define the resonance width @xmath351 and resonance mass @xmath350 separately . in the particle data table @xcite the relativistic quasistable particles are classified by a mass @xmath350 and a width @xmath588 or by a mass and a lifetime @xmath455 .",
    "the known relativistic quasistable particles fall into two categories : those for which one can measure the width of their lineshape ( given by a relativistic breit - wigner or others ) ( when @xmath599 ) and those for which one can measure the lifetime from the ( usually ) exponential decay rate ( when @xmath600 ) .",
    "the relativistic breit - wigner lineshape is easily obtained from the @xmath0-matrix ( laurent expansion ) . to obtain the exponential probability rate",
    "one postulates heuristic non - relativistic gamow functions and @xmath138-dimensional complex hamiltonian matrices for the self - adjoint hamiltonian operator ( e.g. , @xmath140 for the neutral kaon system @xcite ) .",
    "the questions how this complex matrix is derived from the self - adjoint hamiltonian @xmath601 of the poincar time translations or whether @xmath602 are not addressed , except perhaps in analogy to the non - relativistic case for which one justifies the lifetime - width relation by the weisskopf - wigner approximation @xcite .    in this and the preceding paper @xcite we have addressed this question of the nature of a relativistic quasistable particle by starting with the most universally accepted definition of a resonance by the second sheet pole at @xmath2 of",
    "the analytically continued partial @xmath0-matrix @xmath603 , where @xmath12 is the square of the scattering energy , @xmath604 .",

    "the immediate consequence of this is causal propagation of probability .",
    "the @xmath0-matrix element @xmath613 given by @xmath614 @xmath77 of @xcite represents the probability amplitude to detect the out - observable @xmath60 of in the prepared in - state @xmath57 of .",
    "the observable @xmath60 can by only be predicted in the forward light cone relative to the prepared state @xmath57 in @xmath615 of @xcite .",
    "this is discussed in section [ sec4 ] , in particular for the resonance state described by the gamow vector .    within the mathematical setting provided by the hypothesis the gamow kets @xmath616 ^ -{\\rangle}$ ]",
    "can be defined as the vectors with an ideal breit - wigner energy wavefunction .",
    "they are continuous antilinear functionals on @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , they are generalized eigenvectors of the momentum operators with complex eigenvalues . in particular , they have a complex mass @xmath617 .",
    "these complex eigenvalues of the self - adjoint momentum operators are obtained in the same way as the ordinary eigenvalues of the dirac kets , only that the schwartz rigged hilbert space has to be replaced by the pair of hardy rigged hilbert spaces .",
    "the gamow kets have been shown in @xcite to be associated with a resonance pole in the second sheet of the relativistic @xmath0-matrix at @xmath618 . from their transformation property",
    "follows that they span a semigroup representation space of the causal poincar transformations characterized by @xmath619 $ ] , with @xmath139 representing spin of the resonating partial wave and , @xmath334 , the complex pole position . in order to retain as much similarity as possible with wigner s unitary representations of the poincar group for stable particles",
    "@xmath620 $ ] and to maintain the meaning of the spin @xmath139 of a resonance , only semigroup representations with minimally complex momentum are considered , which means that the momentum is given by @xmath353 , where the 4-velocities @xmath621 are real .",
    "the general transformation formula of the relativistic gamow kets under causal poincar transformations @xmath345 is given by which looks very similar to wigner s unitary poincar group transformation , but differs by the property that transformations are allowed only into the forward light cone .",
    "from follows the exponential time evolution for an isolated gamow state at rest and the exponential decay law for a gamow state moving with constant velocity @xmath622 along the @xmath458-direction , as it has been used in experiments @xcite .",
    "the prepared state @xmath57 is in general not given by a gamow vector but it is a linear superposition of gamow vectors for all the @xmath138 resonance poles of the @xmath139-th partial @xmath0-matrix @xmath152 and in addition there is a background vector , .",
    "thus the prepared state is given by the complex basis vector expansion , which is very similar to the heuristic expansion in terms of eigenstates with complex eigenvalues @xmath623 for a finite dimensional effective hamiltonian , like e.g. , of the @xmath424-system in .",
    "due to the background vector @xmath164 over the energy continuum ( which is always lost in the weisskopf - wigner approximation ) one obtains in general also deviations from the exponential decay law for a prepared in - state @xmath57 .",
    "this explains that in spite of the exponential time evolution for the gamow state , describing the resonance per se , one may observe deviations from the exponential law even if there is only one resonance present .",
    "the resonance per se is characterized by @xmath624 and has exponential evolution and according to one predicts for the lifetime of a resonance with breit - wigner width @xmath351 that @xmath625 .",
    "the validity of lifetime @xmath386 inverse width relation for @xmath351 and not for any of the other width definitions , e.g. , @xmath626 of @xcite , removes the ambiguity in the definition of resonance mass and width @xcite for relativistic resonances .",
    "it predicts that the width and mass is given by @xmath350 , @xmath351 and that the lineshape of the resonance per se is given by the `` exact '' relativistic breit - wigner @xmath160 of @xcite .",
    "this also fixes the background amplitude as the difference of the scattering amplitude and the `` exact '' breit - wigner @xmath337 of @xcite .",
    "the parameters @xmath627 do not depend upon the experiment that prepares the state . for different experiments with different prepared in - states the background term in the amplitude and in the state vector , may change from experiment to experiment , and so will the deviation from the exponential decay law . but the parameters @xmath628 for the resonance per se and the lineshape of the resonance per se will not depend upon the experiment . eliminating the background in the analysis of the decay data for",
    "each particular experiment should reveal the exponential character of decay .",

    "was completed , we became aware of a remarkable paper by l.  s.  schulman @xcite , who already in 1969 classified the poincar semigroup representations and identified our `` minimally complex '' representations @xmath341 $ ] as the representations of physical unstable particles .",
