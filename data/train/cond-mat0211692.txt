    "over the last twenty years or so , a large amount of work has been devoted to the study of the dynamics of noisy nonlinear systems driven by external periodic forces .",
    "one of the main reasons for this interest is related to the phenomenon of stochastic resonance ( sr ) @xcite namely , the possibility of using the concerted action of noise and nonlinearity to augment selectively , for some parameter values , the output of the nonlinear system with respect to what it would be for a linear system dynamics .",
    "the two common quantifiers for stochastic resonance are the spectral amplification measure @xcite and the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "they are defined in terms of the fourier components of the correlation function associated to the stochastic variable , @xmath0 . due to the periodicity of the driving force , the stochastic process @xmath0 is explicitly nonstationary .",
    "thus , the two - time function @xmath1 depends on both @xmath2 and @xmath3 . for very large values of @xmath2 ,",
    "this quantity is periodic in @xmath2 with the period of the external driving .",
    "thus , its cycle average over one period of @xmath2 yields a function of just @xmath3 : the correlation function , @xmath4 .",
    "the analysis of its structure reveals that @xmath4 is the sum of two terms @xcite : one term is periodic in @xmath3 with the same period as the driving force and it is called the coherent part , @xmath5 .",
    "the other term , the incoherent part @xmath6 , decays to zero for @xmath7 .",
    "the snr of the output process , @xmath0 , is defined as the ratio of the amplitude of the fourier mode of the coherent part at the driving frequency , and the power spectral density of the incoherent part taken also at the driving frequency . by definition ,",
    "the snr is thus a dimensional quantity .",
    "the snr of an input signal ( snr@xmath8 ) containing the sum of the external driving and the gaussian white noise can easily be evaluated .",
    "a convenient dimensionless parameter can then be defined as follows : the gain , @xmath9 , defined by the ratio of snr of the output over the ( snr@xmath8 ) . for the case",
    "that the langevin dynamics is linear in @xmath10 driven by additive white gaussian noise , then the output snr is exactly the same as snr@xmath8 ; i.e. the gain assumes precisely the value unity . in a general nonlinear case , neither the snr nor the gain can be evaluated exactly by analytical means . as a consequence ,",
    "their evaluation necessarily requires approximate procedures .",
    "it was pointed out previously that the gain of a noisy nonlinear dynamical system subject to subthreshold signals can not exceed @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "this feature has been rationalized using the ideas of linear response theory ( lrt ) , thought to be valid for weak driving amplitudes and not too small noise strengths .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that the validity of lrt critically depends also on the value of the frequency , as has convincingly been demonstrated in recent works @xcite .    in the context of lrt theory",
    "it has been pointed out in @xcite that a corollary of lrt is that `` for small amplitude signals , the signal - to - noise ratio at the output of a system driven by a stationary gaussian noise does not exceed that at the input , even if the system displays sr '' . moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors state that for `` small signal in a gaussian noise background , it is a theorem that the snr at the output of a non - linear device must be less than or equal to the snr at the input '' . on the other hand , studies on _ nondynamical _ systems @xcite , on dynamical systems driven by large amplitude sinusoidal forces",
    "@xcite , and on dynamical systems driven by pulsed ( multifrequency ) periodic forces with subthreshold amplitudes @xcite , have reported gains larger than unity . clearly , for this to occur",
    ", the stochastic system must operate in a regime where lrt does not apply .",
    "it is therefore of interest to delineate carefully the limit of applicability of the lrt description of the correlation function , the snr and the gain of a nonlinear noisy driven system .    in this paper",
    "we have tackled this challenge by carrying out a detailed numerical evaluation of the correlation function @xmath4 and its components , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , of the snr and the gain of a bistable noisy system which is driven by time periodic forces .",
    "the numerical predictions have been compared with those provided by the lrt approximation which accounts for the full spectrum of all relaxation modes .",
    "as it is well known , lrt requires the knowledge of the system susceptibility , or alternatively , of the correlation function of the noisy system in the absence of driving , @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "none of these quantities are known exactly for nonlinear systems . for sufficiently small values of the noise strength , suitable analytical approximations to @xmath12",
    "can been used @xcite . on the other hand , for large values of the noise intensity",
    ", we have evaluated @xmath12 from the numerical solution of the fokker - planck equation using an adaptation of the split operator technique of feit _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , as it has been detailed in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we also present a detailed proof of the statement that within lrt , the gain g@xmath13 , by use of the full spectral approach ; this proof differs from alternative attempts in refs .",
    "@xcite which use additional restrictions such as a linear response theory for the fluctuations themselves .",
    "the `` typical '' procedure to evaluate the snr involves the fourier analysis of a very long record of the stochastic trajectory , @xmath0 . using the fast fourier transform ( fft ) of the record ,",
    "the corresponding periodogram is constructed .",
    "there are several drawbacks with this procedure .",
    "there are subtleties inherent to the interpretation and evaluation of the periodogram ( see for instance the critical comments in @xcite ) .",
    "there are also major problems associated with the fact that the power spectrum contains @xmath14-peaks at the driving frequency and its higher harmonics arising from the coherent part of the correlation function .",
    "the contribution of the incoherent part at those frequencies is embedded in those peaks , and it is not a simple task to estimate the separate contribution to the peaks of the coherent and incoherent parts of the periodogram .",
    "the evaluation of the snr - gain requires a good knowledge of both contributions , and any small error in the estimation of the incoherent contribution , yields unreasonable values for the gain .",
    "indeed , in our opinion , a much better estimate would be obtained if the periodic part of the output signal were subtracted from the data before performing its fft .    in this work",
    "we propose such an alternative procedure .",
    "the langevin equation is numerically integrated for a large number of noise realizations .",
    "the time evolution of the correlation function and its coherent part are directly evaluated from the numerical solution after averaging over the noise realizations .",
    "the incoherent part is obtained from the difference @xmath15 .",
    "as the definition of snr requires just the amplitude of the fourier mode of @xmath5 and the spectral density of @xmath6 at the driving frequency , the snr can readily be evaluated with two numerical quadratures ; i.e. there is no need to construct the full spectrum .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and provide definitions of the quantities of interest . in section iii ,",
    "the main points of the lrt description of the correlation functions are detailed .",
    "we also present in this section a novel and straightforward proof of the fact that g@xmath13 , based on the spectral properties of the fokker - planck operator , and its adjoint , in the absence of driving . in section iv , we present the numerical procedure used to obtain the correlation function , the snr and the gain from the numerical solution of the langevin equation .",
    "the very efficient algorithm used in this work is summarized in the appendix .",
    "the numerical results are compared with the predictions of lrt for a variety of parameters and two distinct types of driving forces : a monochromatic force and a periodic sequence of pulses . finally , we present conclusions for the main findings of our work .",
    "let us consider a system characterized by a single degree of freedom , @xmath10 , subject to the action of a zero average gaussian white noise with @xmath16 and driven by an external periodic signal @xmath17 with period @xmath18 . in the langevin description ,",
    "its dynamics is generated by the equation @xmath19+f(t)+\\xi(t).\\ ] ] the corresponding linear fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) for the probability density @xmath20 reads @xmath21 where @xmath22.\\ ] ] in the expressions above , @xmath23 represents the derivative of the potential @xmath24 .",
    "the periodicity of the external driving @xmath17 allows its fourier series expansion in the harmonics of the fundamental frequency @xmath25 , i.e. , @xmath26,\\ ] ] with the fourier coefficients , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , given by @xmath29 here , we are assuming that the cycle average of the external driving over its period equals zero .",
    "the two - time correlation function @xmath30 in the limit @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the time - periodic , asymptotic long time solution of the fpe and the quantity @xmath34 denotes the two - time conditional probability density that the stochastic variable will have a value near @xmath10 at time @xmath35 if its value at time @xmath2 was exactly @xmath36 .",
    "it can been shown @xcite that , in the limit @xmath31 , the two - time correlation function @xmath37 becomes a periodic function of @xmath2 with the period of the external driving .",
    "then , we define the one - time correlation function , @xmath4 , as the average of the two - time correlation function over a period of the external driving , i.e. , @xmath38 the correlation function @xmath4 can be written exactly as the sum of two contributions : a coherent part , @xmath5 , which is periodic in @xmath3 with period @xmath18 , and an incoherent part which decays to @xmath39 for large @xmath3 .",
    "the coherent part @xmath5 is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the average value evaluated with the asymptotic form of the probability density @xmath33 .",
    "it is possible to carry out a formal analysis of @xmath4 and its coherent and incoherent components by making use of the spectral analysis of the floquet operator associated with the fokker - planck dynamics .",
    "but an explicit evaluation of the correlation function is generally impossible ; thus , one has to rely on numerical results obtained from integrating either the langevin or the fpe , or by use of approximate analytical descriptions .    according to mcnamara and wiesenfeld @xcite",
    ", the snr is defined in terms of the fourier transform of the coherent and incoherent parts of @xmath4 . as",
    "the correlation function is even in time and we evaluate its time dependence for @xmath42 , it is convenient to use its fourier cosine transform , defined as @xmath43 for the snr we define : @xmath44 note that this definition of the snr differs by a factor @xmath45 , stemming from the same contribution at @xmath46 , from the definitions used in earlier works @xcite .",
    "the periodicity of the coherent part gives rise to delta peaks in the spectrum .",
    "thus , the only contribution to the numerator in eq.([snr ] ) stems from the coherent part of the correlation function .",
    "the evaluation of the snr requires the knowledge of the fourier components of @xmath5 and @xmath6 at the fundamental frequency of the driving force .",
    "the entire fourier spectrum is not needed .",
    "the evaluation of the snr thus requires the evaluation of two well defined numerical quadratures only ; i.e. , @xmath47 the signal - to - noise ratio for an input signal @xmath48 , is given by @xmath49 the so - called gain is defined as the ratio of the snr of the output over the snr of the input ; namely , @xmath50",
    "the linear response theory provides a general procedure to describe the correlation function in an approximate way .",
    "the basic quantity of lrt is the system response function , @xmath51 .",
    "it is related to the equilibrium time correlation function of the system in the absence of external driving , @xmath12 , via the fluctuation - dissipation theorem ( fdt ) @xcite , i.e. , @xmath52 the equilibrium time correlation function @xmath12 is defined as @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the equilibrium distribution of the non - driven system , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the conditional probability density to find , in the absence of driving , the variable near @xmath10 at time @xmath2 , if it was initially at exactly @xmath36 .",
    "here we are assuming that the potential @xmath24 is even in @xmath10 , so that @xmath57 .    within lrt , the long time average value @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 insertion of the fourier expansion eq .",
    "( [ fourf ] ) into eq.([lrt ] ) leads to @xmath60,\\ ] ] where the coefficients @xmath61 and @xmath62 are given by @xmath63 in these formulas , we have introduced the quantities @xmath64 and @xmath65 defined as @xmath66 the use of the fdt in the above expressions allows us to write immediately @xmath67 it then follows from eq .",
    "( [ chtau ] ) that within lrt , the coherent part of the correlation function is given by , @xmath68 \\cos ( n \\omega \\tau).\\ ] ] as discussed in refs.@xcite , lrt amounts to keeping the leading term in the perturbation treatment of the dynamics of the stochastic process @xmath0 in powers of the driving amplitude .",
    "then , within the spirit of perturbation theory , the leading term in the expansion of the incoherent part corresponds to the correlation function of the system in the absence of driving force , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath70 is periodic in @xmath3 , it follows from eqs .",
    "( [ fourier ] ) and ( [ cohlrt ] ) that",
    "@xmath71 \\left [ \\delta ( n\\omega -\\omega)+\\delta ( n\\omega + \\omega ) \\right ] .\\ ] ] thus , it follows from the definition of the snr , eq .",

( [ snrinp ] ) , ( [ gain ] ) and ( [ snrlrt ] ) , one readily finds that the gain within lrt is given by @xmath74}{\\chi_1^{(i)}}.\\ ] ] this is a general expression for @xmath75 valid for any shape of periodic driving .",
    "the last expression will allow us to show that @xmath75 can , indeed , not exceed unity .",
    "although this assertion has been discussed previously in ref .",
    "@xcite , we next will present a detailed and hopefully very clear proof for this prominent assertion .    as shown in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite , see also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the susceptibility , @xmath51 , can be expressed as @xmath76 where @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of the fp operator @xmath80 associated to the undriven dynamics and its adjoint , @xmath81 , i.e. , @xmath82 using the above representation of the susceptibility in eqs .",
    "( [ suscepa ] ) and ( [ suscepb ] ) with @xmath83 , we find @xmath84 here , we have used the inequality @xmath85 which can be proved as follows .",
    "multiplying the first equation in eq .",
    "( [ eig ] ) by @xmath10 and carrying out an integration by parts , one obtains @xmath86 where we have taken into account that @xmath87 and @xmath88 , so that @xmath89",

    "thus , by adding eq .",
    "( [ tres ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ cuatro ] ) , one obtains @xmath94 finally , inserting eq .",
    "( [ cinco ] ) into ( [ gainlrt ] ) , we obtain the seminal inequality that @xmath95 .    put differently , the gain of a nonlinear system operating in a regime where lrt provides a valid description can not reach values greater than @xmath11 .",
    "this result is valid for _ any _ periodic external driving .",
    "notice that this finding does not preclude the possibility of obtaining values for the snr - gain larger than unity when the conditions are such that the use of lrt is not sensible .",
    "in this section , we will carry out the numerical evaluation of the different magnitudes defined above .",
    "our goal is to compare the predictions of lrt with the results obtained from the numerical solution of the langevin equation , eq .",
    "( [ langev ] ) .",
    "we will consider the dynamics in the bistable potential @xmath96 driven by time periodic forces .",

    "are unknown , but useful approximations have been presented in the literature . for the bistable potential ,",
    "@xmath96 , jung and hnggi @xcite have used the two - mode approximation .",
    "it is based on the existence of a large difference in the time scales associated to inter - well and intra - well motions , and it is expected to be valid for small values of the noise strength @xmath97 . with this model , one finds @xmath98 where @xcite @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the weights , @xmath101 and @xmath102 , can be obtained from the moments of the equilibrium distribution in the absence of driving using the expressions @xmath103 @xmath104 to leading order in @xmath97 , we can replace @xmath105 by @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this is the limit considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the results reported below , we have also considered values of @xmath97 so large that the two - mode approximation becomes inadequate .",
    "therefore , the correlation function in the absence of driving has been evaluated numerically from the fpe in the absence of driving following the procedure discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical evaluation of the correlation function @xmath4 and its coherent and incoherent parts proceeds as follows .",
    "stochastic trajectories , @xmath109 , are generated by numerically integrating the langevin equation for every realization @xmath110 of the white noise @xmath111 , starting from a given initial condition @xmath112 .",
    "the numerical solution is based on the algorithm developed by greenside and helfand @xcite .",
    "the essence of the algorithm is briefly sketched in the appendix . after allowing for a relaxation transient stage ,",
    "we start recording the time evolution of each random trajectory for many different trajectories .",
    "then , we construct the two - time ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) correlation function , i.e. , @xmath113 as well as the product of the averages @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the number of stochastic trajectories considered .",
    "the correlation function @xmath4 and its coherent part @xmath5 are then obtained using their definitions in eqs .",
    "( [ ctau ] ) and ( [ chtau ] ) , performing the cycle average over one period of @xmath2 .",
    "the difference between the values of @xmath4 and @xmath5 allows us to obtain the values for @xmath6 .",
    "it is then straightforward to evaluate the fourier component of @xmath5 and the fourier transform of @xmath6 at the driving frequency by numerical quadrature . with that information ,",
    "the numerator and the denominator in the expression ( [ snr ] ) for the snr and the gain ( eq .  ( [ gain ] ) ) are obtained .",
    "we shall analyze two different types of periodic driving forces .",
    "first , let us consider the well known situation with a monochromatic , single frequency force , @xmath116 , with amplitude strength @xmath117 and angular frequency @xmath118 @xcite . in this case , the formulas in sect .",
    "iii simplify considerably because @xmath119 , while all the other fourier components of the driving force vanish .",
    "the second case corresponds to a periodic force with period @xmath18 , with a sequence of pulses of length @xmath120 ; namely , @xmath121 in this case , we have @xmath122,\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the fundamental frequency .",
    "this force is characterized by its amplitude , its period and its duty cycle , which is defined as @xmath123 .",
    "recently , gingl _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have carried out analogue simulations of systems that are subjected to wideband gaussian noise and driving forces of this second type .",
    "they report values for the gain which greatly exceeds unity , for driving amplitudes below its threshold value .",
    "if this is the case , then strong deviations from the lrt should be observed as well .      in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] we depict the results obtained for a monochromatic driving force with angular frequency @xmath124 , noise strength @xmath125 and several values of the amplitude . in the deterministic dynamics ( @xmath126 ) , an external periodic force with the indicated frequency induces sustained oscillations between the minima of the potential for @xmath127 .",
    "note that this nonadiabatic frequency raises the threshold value for superthreshold driving beyond its adiabatic lower limit of @xmath128 .",
    "thus , we will take this value as the amplitude threshold value at the frequency @xmath124 . in panel",
    "( a ) , we plot the _ numerators _ of the snr in eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) and of snr@xmath129 in eq.([snrlrt ] ) _ vs. _ @xmath130 .",
    "the solid straight line represents the lrt result , while the circles correspond to the numerical results .",
    "the graph reveals that for amplitude strengths @xmath131 the predictions of lrt match well the numerical results , as can be expected .",
    "when the amplitude increases , the deviations of lrt from the precise numerical results are large .",
    "lrt predicts a much larger amplification of the output amplitude than the one obtained numerically . in panel ( b ) , we plot the _ denominators _ of the snr in eq .",
    "( [ snr ] ) ( circles ) and of snr@xmath129 in eq .",

    "the denominator is independent of @xmath117 .",
    "once again , the predictions of lrt match the numerical results for @xmath131 . for larger values of @xmath117 ,",
    "the influence of the driving amplitude on the relaxation of @xmath6 is very strong and the numerical results for the denominator are much smaller than the ones obtained within lrt .",
    "it is then clear that lrt will yield a valid description of the signal - to - noise ratio for small driving amplitudes only as depicted in panel ( c ) .",
    "we notice that the values for the snr provided by the numerics are larger than snr@xmath129 .",
    "this is so although linear response theory predicts larger spectral amplifications , see in @xcite , of the average output than what really occurs .",
    "the modifications in the behavior of the incoherent part of the correlation function with respect to its behavior in the absence of driving are more than enough to compensate for the behavior of the numerators . in panel",
    "( d ) we plot the gain _ vs. _ @xmath130 .",
    "there exists an optimum value for the driver amplitude ( @xmath132 ) at which the gain becomes maximized . nonetheless , the gain is always smaller than unity .",
    "lrt requires that @xmath133 .",
    "these strong deviations of the predictions of lrt about the behavior of the two components of the correlation function with respect to the numerical results tell us that lrt can not be invoked to explain the fact that the gain is smaller than @xmath11 for the range of parameter values considered in this figure ; i.e. a gain below @xmath11 occurs here within the nonlinear regime .    in figs .",
    "[ wp2 ] and [ wp3 ] we analyze the same quantities as in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] , but now for larger noise values , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , respectively . the most important difference with respect to the plots in fig .",
    "[ wp1 ] is that for these larger values of the noise , the gain can _ exceed _ unity for values of the amplitude well above its threshold value .",
    "this superthreshold feature has been corroborated already in ref .",
    "@xcite ; a gain above @xmath11 seemingly does not occur for monochromatic subthreshold driving .",
    "next , we proceed to consider the case of pulsed driving forces . in figs .",
    "[ wp4 ] and [ wp5 ] we compare the dependence of the output on the driving amplitude as given by the lrt approximation with the numerical precise results . the system is forced by a multifrequency driver with a period @xmath136 and a duty cycle of @xmath137 . as in the case of a single frequency",
    "driving , the values of the different quantities obtained from the numerics deviate significantly from the predictions of lrt as the amplitude of the driver is increased .",
    "nevertheless , perhaps the most relevant difference with respect to the monochromatic case is that we again do _ not _ find gains larger than @xmath138 in the range of parameter values considered in these figures .",
    "a particularly interesting situation arises in the analogue studies of pulsed driving forces with a very _ small _ fundamental frequency : in refs .",
    "@xcite gingl _ et al .",
    "_ report gains that significantly exceed the value @xmath11 for a subthreshold , multifrequency driving force of very large period @xmath139 and a small duty cycle of @xmath137 .",
    "this large gain is accompanied by a non - monotonic behavior of the snr with the noise strength @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , this situation must correspond to a very sensible discrepancy of the actual behavior with respect to the lrt predictions .",
    "we have carried out detailed and careful numerics of the langevin equation in this extreme regime for such a driving force with a subthreshold amplitude @xmath140 and a noise strength @xmath141 . with the parameters considered",
    ", the problem becomes computationally very demanding indeed : this is so because of the very large period of the driving force .",
    "moreover , in order to obtain reliable numerical results for the incoherent part of the correlation function a large number of stochastic trajectories needs to be generated .",

    "<S> in the context of the phenomenon of _ stochastic resonance _ ( sr ) we study the correlation function , the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) and the ratio of output over input snr , i.e. the _ gain _ , which is associated to the nonlinear response of a bistable system driven by time - periodic forces and white gaussian noise . these quantifiers for sr are evaluated using the techniques of linear response theory ( lrt ) beyond the usually employed two - mode approximation scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we analytically demonstrate within such an extended lrt description that the gain can indeed _ not _ exceed unity . </S>",
    "<S> we implement an efficient algorithm , based on work by greenside and helfand ( detailed in the appendix ) , to integrate the driven langevin equation over a wide range of parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> the predictions of lrt are carefully tested against the results obtained from numerical solutions of the corresponding langevin equation over a wide range of parameter values . </S>",
    "<S> we further present an accurate procedure to evaluate the distinct contributions of the coherent and incoherent parts of the correlation function to the snr and the gain . as a main result we show for subthreshold driving that both , the correlation function and the snr can deviate substantially from the predictions of lrt and yet </S>",
    "<S> , the gain can be either larger or smaller than unity . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the gain can exceed unity in the strongly nonlinear regime which is characterized by weak noise and very slow multifrequency _ subthreshold _ input signals with a small duty cycle . </S>",
