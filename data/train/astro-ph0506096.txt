    "in many clusters of galaxies the radiative cooling time of intracluster plasma within the central 50  kpc is shorter than a cluster s age . in the cooling - flow model plasma heating is neglected and the rate at which plasma cools to low temperatures ( @xmath4 ) is large , exceeding  @xmath5 in some clusters ( fabian 1994 ) .",
    "recent high - spectral - resolution x - ray observations , however , show that the actual rate at which plasma cools to low temperatures is  @xmath6 ( peterson et  al  2001 , 2003 ; bhringer et  al  2001 ; tamura et  al  2001 ; molendi & pizzolato  2001 ) .",
    "this discrepancy , some times referred to as the `` cooling - flow problem , '' suggests that plasma heating approximately balances radiative cooling in cluster cores .",
    "plasma heating is also relevant to other unsolved problems in the study of galaxy clusters .",
    "numerical simulations of cluster formation show that some heat source in addition to supernovae is needed to explain observed temperature and density profiles , star - formation histories , and mass - temperature and luminosity - temperature scaling relations ( suginohara & ostriker  1998 ; lewis et  al  2000 ; voit et  al  2002 ; tornatore et  al  2003 ; nagai & kravtsov  2004 ; borgani et  al  2004 ; dolag et  al  2004 ) .",
    "this paper focuses on plasma heating by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) at the centers of clusters .",
    "the importance of agn heating is suggested by the observation that almost all clusters with strongly cooling cores possess active central radio sources ( eilek  2004 ) .",
    "several mechanisms have been considered for transferring agn power to intracluster plasma , including magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) wave - mediated plasma heating by cosmic rays ( bhringer & morfill  1988 ; rosner & tucker  1989 ; loewenstein , zweibel , & begelman  1991 ) , compton heating ( binney & tabor 1995 ; ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; ciotti , ostriker , & pellegrini  2004 ) , shocks ( tabor & binney 1993 , binney & tabor 1995 ) , and cosmic - ray bubbles produced by the central agn ( churazov et al  2001 , 2002 ; reynolds 2002 ; brggen  2003 ; reynolds et  al  2005 ) .",
    "such bubbles can heat intracluster plasma by generating turbulence ( loewenstein & fabian 1990 , churazov et  al  2004 ) and sound waves ( fabian et  al  2003 ; ruszkowski , brggen , & begelman 2004a , b ) and by doing @xmath7 work ( begelman 2001 , 2002 ; ruszkowski & begelman  2002 ; hoeft & brggen  2004 ) .",
    "although considerable progress has been made , the coupling between agn and cluster plasmas is still not well understood .",
    "the present paper describes how agn can heat intracluster plasmas by driving convection . in section  [ sec : stability ]",
    "physical arguments are used to obtain the convective stability criterion in magnetized low - density plasmas containing cosmic rays .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] develops a steady - state model of convective intracluster plasmas . in this model ,",
    "a central supermassive black hole accretes intracluster plasma at the bondi rate  @xmath0 , leading to cosmic - ray production by a central radio source .",
    "the cosmic - ray luminosity  @xmath1 is taken to be proportional to  @xmath8 , and it is assumed that the cosmic - rays mix into the thermal intracluster plasma .",
    "the cosmic - ray pressure gradient drives convection , which is treated with a two - fluid ( thermal - plasma and cosmic - ray ) mixing length theory .",
    "convection heats the plasma in three ways , by mixing hot plasma from the outer regions of a cluster in towards the center of the cluster , by providing a vehicle for cosmic - ray pressure to do work on the thermal plasma , and through the viscous dissipation of turbulent motions .",
    "it is assumed that plasma heating balances radiative cooling .",
    "the heating rate is self - regulating because @xmath0 is a decreasing function of the specific entropy near the center of the cluster ,  @xmath3 ; if heating exceeds cooling , then  @xmath3 rises , @xmath0 falls , and the convective heating rate drops ( nulsen 2004 ; bhringer 2004a ) .",
    "the model leads to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations that are solved numerically using a shooting method .    in section  [ sec : dis ] the model is compared to observations . for a single choice of the model s free parameters , the solutions to the model equations compare reasonably well with observations of the virgo cluster , the perseus cluster , and abell  478 .",
    "however , the model underestimates the plasma density in the central @xmath9  kpc . this discrepancy may arise because the model does not properly account for the observed incomplete mixing of cosmic rays into the thermal plasma in the central region , a point discussed further in section  [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the model differs from an earlier two - fluid convection model ( chandran  2004hereafter paper  i ) primarily by including the effects of anisotropic conduction and cosmic - ray diffusion on convection .",
    "anisotropic transport allows smaller cosmic - ray pressures to drive convection , which enables the model of the present paper to provide a better fit to the data .",
    "( in paper  i , a larger central cosmic - ray pressure leads to an even smaller thermal pressure and density in the central @xmath9  kpc . )",
    "in addition to the topics mentioned above , section  [ sec : dis ] also describes the relation of the model to other turbulent heating models and addresses the consequences of the model for diffuse gamma - ray emission from clusters and the mixing of heavy elements in the intracluster medium .",
    "in this section , physical arguments are used to obtain the stability criterion for convection in a magnetized plasma / cosmic - ray fluid .",
    "figure  [ fig : f1 ] depicts a fluid parcel rising from an initial radial coordinate  @xmath10 to a final coordinate  @xmath11 .",
    "only instabilities on length scales  @xmath12 are considered .",
    "the gravitational acceleration  @xmath13 is in the @xmath14  direction .",
    "the horizontal solid line is a field line in the equilibrium magnetic field , which is taken to be perpendicular to  @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed line depicts how the field line is displaced as the fluid parcel rises .",
    "it is assumed that the magnetic field is strong enough so that heat and cosmic rays diffuse primarily along magnetic field lines ( a requirement easily met in clusters ) but sufficiently weak that the lorentz force can be ignored .",
    "the latter assumption may be too restrictive for clusters , but is maintained throughout this paper for simplicity .",
    "it is assumed that equilibrium quantities depend only on  @xmath16 .",
    "the equilibrium temperature , thermal - particle density , and cosmic ray pressure at @xmath10 and @xmath17 are denoted @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",

    "is displaced to  @xmath17 , the fluid properties within the parcel are denoted @xmath20 . requiring",
    "that the total pressure within the displaced parcel equal the total pressure in the surrounding medium gives @xmath21 if the frequency  @xmath22 of the fluid s linear modes were constrained to be either real or imaginary , then near marginal stability  @xmath22 would approach  0 and the time scale for the parcel s displacement to grow or oscillate would be very long . in this case",
    "there would be plenty of time for thermal conduction and cosmic - ray diffusion to smooth out  @xmath23 and @xmath24 along the displaced magnetic field lines , giving @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "thus , if @xmath27 were constrained to be real , then near marginal stability equation  ( [ eq : sc1 ] ) could be rewritten @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been expanded in a taylor series about @xmath31 , and terms that are quadratic or higher order in  @xmath32 have been discarded .",
    "equivalently , @xmath33 if @xmath34 , the displaced parcel is heavier than its surroundings and sinks back down , and the fluid is stable to convection .",
    "conversely , if @xmath35 , the parcel is buoyant and the fluid is unstable .",

    "[ in stellar interiors , heat is transported primarily by photons , the conductivity is isotropic , and balbus s criterion does not apply ( balbus 2001 ) . ]    in section  [ sec : model ] , the above physical arguments are extended in an approximate way to galaxy clusters , in which the magnetic field lines are tangled .",

    "it is assumed that radiative cooling is balanced by a combination of turbulent heating and thermal conduction .",
    "the turbulence arises from convection , which is driven by the cosmic - ray pressure gradient .",
    "the cosmic rays are produced by a central radio source , and it is assumed that the cosmic rays mix into the thermal plasma .",
    "the model treats convection using a nonlocal two - fluid mixing length theory . in some ways",
    "the model is analogous to a convective star , with cosmic rays playing the role of photons .",
    "the model is compared to observations in figure  [ fig : f3 ] . for perseus ,",
    "the model temperature profile has a plateau - like feature at @xmath339  kpc , which also appears in the observational data .",
    "this local flattening of the temperature profile makes the intracluster medium more convectively unstable , and is associated with large turbulent velocities .",
    "the model predicts maximum turbulent velocities of order 300  km / s in perseus , similar in magnitude to the plasma velocities inferred by churazov et  al  ( 2004 ) .",
    "it should be emphasized that the three solutions shown in figure  [ fig : f3 ] are all based on a single choice of `` round - number '' values for the model s free parameters , as opposed to values that were fine - tuned to fit the data .",
    "given the lack of fine tuning , the model is reasonably successful at matching the observations , although there are some important discrepancies .",
    "the model overestimates the temperature in a478 at @xmath340  kpc and underestimates the electron density at @xmath341  kpc in each cluster .",
    "this density discrepancy persists for all values of the model s free parameters that have been investigated thus far and may be related to the assumption that the cosmic rays are well mixed into the thermal plasma , as discussed further in the next section .",
    "the mixing - length theory developed in section  [ sec : model ] treats the turbulent fluctuations @xmath342 , @xmath343 , and @xmath344 as small quantities .",
    "this entails the assumption that the cosmic rays are well mixed into the thermal plasma ( since at fixed  @xmath16 there is little variation in  @xmath345 ) .",
    "however , roughly one - fourth of the clusters in the chandra archive show clear evidence of x - ray cavities , which are typically @xmath346  kpc in radius at a projected distance of  @xmath347  kpc from the cluster center ( birzan et  al  2004 ) .",
    "many of these cavities are associated with enhanced synchrotron emission , suggesting that the cavities are cosmic - ray bubbles inflated by the central radio source .",
    "these cavities indicate that , at least within the central  @xmath9  kpc of many clusters , the cosmic rays are not well mixed into the thermal plasma and @xmath348 , @xmath349 , etc .",
    "it is likely that the cosmic rays are better mixed into the thermal plasma at larger  @xmath16 , owing to the combined action of cosmic - ray diffusion , instabilities of bubble / plasma interfaces , and turbulent mixing , but in this paper no attempt is made to quantify the degree of mixing as a function of radius .    in low-@xmath24 regions within the central 30  kpc ,",
    "cosmic rays are less able to support the plasma against gravity than in the model of this paper , and @xmath350 has to be larger .",
    "accounting for this properly would likely increase  @xmath351 in parts of the central region , and possibly increase the plasma mass in the central region .",
    "even if the plasma mass profile remained the same but the electrons were confined primarily to some fraction of the volume , the x - ray surface brightness would increase because  @xmath352 . a larger surface brightness",
    "would in turn increase the observationally inferred value of the volume - averaged electron density .",
    "a proper treatment of incomplete mixing might thus resolve the discrepancy between the model density profile and the observations , but further work is needed to investigate this possibility .",
    "several studies have shown that for plausible values of the turbulent velocity and velocity correlation length , heating from turbulent diffusion and viscous dissipation of turbulent motions can balance radiative cooling in clusters with a wide range of average temperatures ( kim & narayan 2003 , voigt & fabian 2004 , dennis & chandran 2005 ) .",
    "the main challenge for turbulent heating models is to explain how @xmath353 gets fine - tuned to the value required for turbulent heating to balance radiative cooling .",
    "the agn - driven convection model presented in this paper offers an explanation for this fine - tuning by linking the turbulence amplitude to the cosmic - ray luminosity  @xmath1 of the central radio source .",
    "the bondi accretion rate  @xmath0 is a decreasing function of the specific entropy of the central plasma , @xmath3 , and @xmath354 .",
    "thus , if @xmath353 were so large that the total heating exceeded radiative cooling , then @xmath3 would grow and @xmath0 and @xmath1 would decrease .",
    "this would in turn reduce  @xmath24 and thereby reduce  @xmath353 , since it is the cosmic - ray pressure gradient that drives the convection .",
    "galaxy clusters with short central cooling times ( `` cooling - core clusters '' ) have centrally peaked heavy - element abundances ( fukazawa et  al  1996 , degrandi & molendi  2001 ) . while the iron abundance peaks sharply towards  @xmath127 in such clusters , the abundance of oxygen is essentially flat in the central region .",
    "since oxygen is effectively produced by type  ii sn but not by type  i sn , the flat oxygen - abundance profile indicates that heavy element enrichment in cluster cores is dominated by type  i sn . for plausible models of the history of the sn ia rate in the central cd galaxy , more than 5  gyr",
    "is typically required for sn  ia to enrich the plasma in cooling - core clusters within the central  @xmath355  kpc to the observed levels ( bhringer et  al  2004b ) .",
    "this implies that turbulence can not transport metals out of the central 50  kpc on a time scale much shorter than 5  gyr . at the same time",
    ", the abundance peak is spread out over a larger region than the stars of the cd galaxy .",
    "thus , some mixing out of the central region is required ( bhringer et  al  2004a ) .",
    "the eddy diffusivity in hydrodynamic turbulence is @xmath356 where @xmath353 is the rms turbulent velocity and @xmath357 is the dominant length scale ( outer scale ) of the turbulent velocity .",
    "values in the literature for the dimensionless constant  @xmath225 range from  0.06 to  0.18 ( see dennis & chandran 2005 ) , although it should be noted that these values depend on the definition employed for  @xmath357 .",
    "[ these values for @xmath225 are @xmath358 because in a 3d random walk the diffusion coefficient is @xmath359 instead of just @xmath360 , where  @xmath361 is the step size and @xmath177 is the time between steps ( chandrasekhar 1943 ) . ]",
    "if @xmath362 , then the time scale for elements to be mixed out of the region interior to radius  @xmath16 , @xmath363 , is @xmath364 some studies have argued that in mhd turbulence , magnetic tension reduces @xmath365 relative to the estimate in equation  ( [ eq : deddy ] ) ( vainshtein & rosner 1991 , cattaneo 1994 ) , but this claim has been recently challenged ( cho et  al  2003 ) .    equation  ( [ eq : tmix ] ) indicates that mixing times are comparable to enrichment times for plausible turbulence parameters , although a more careful analysis is needed to determine whether the agn - driven convection model is consistent with enrichment - time constraints .",
    "two factors that would affect such an analysis are the following .",
    "first , the turbulent velocity peaks in the central region , dropping significantly outside of the central 50  kpc in the solutions plotted in figure  [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "this allows for efficient mixing within the central 50 - 100  kpc , but reduces the rate at which metals are mixed out to larger radii .",
    "second , the observed incomplete mixing of cosmic rays in the central  @xmath9  kpc discussed above may limit the ability of rising cosmic - ray - dominated bubbles in the very central region to carry enriched plasma outwards ( see , e.g. , brggen et  al  2002 ) .",
    "cosmic - ray protons in the intracluster medium interact with thermal - plasma nucleons to produce pions .",
    "neutral pions then decay into gamma rays . in this section ,",
    "the results of pfrommer & ensslin ( 2004 ) are used to calculate the gamma - ray fluxes that would result from the model solutions for  @xmath366 and  @xmath367 presented in section  [ sec : model ] . the cosmic - ray - proton distribution function ( number of cosmic - ray protons per unit volume per unit momentum ) , denoted  @xmath173 , is assumed to be @xmath368 where the constant  @xmath369 is a free parameter satisfying  @xmath370 . at the risk of notational confusion , @xmath53 in equation  ( [ eq : deff ] ) is the cosmic - ray momentum , even though  @xmath53 was previously defined to be the plasma pressure .",
    "it is assumed that all of the cosmic - ray pressure arises from cosmic - ray protons .",
    "the value of  @xmath371 corresponding to the model solutions of section  [ sec : model ] is thus determined by equating the value of @xmath366 in the model solutions to @xmath372 , where  @xmath373 is the cosmic - ray speed at momentum  @xmath53 .",

    "once  @xmath371 is determined , the observed flux of gamma rays is obtained using equations ( 19 ) through  ( 21 ) of pfrommer & ensslin ( 2004 ) and the model solutions for  @xmath367 .",
    "the flux at earth of photons with energies exceeding  100  mev emitted by the central 300  kpc of each cluster is listed in table  [ tab : t2 ] for four values of the parameter  @xmath369 , along with egret upper limits from reimer  et  al  ( 2003 ) .",
    "the predicted fluxes are all below the egret upper limits .",
