    "the work presented in this chapter has its origins in a seemingly mundane microwave engineering question : is it possible to apply a dc voltage ( or current ) bias to the center conductor of a superconducting coplanar microwave cavity , without significantly affecting the quality factor of , say , the first and second microwave modes of the cavity ?",
    "our original motivation behind this question was to devise a circuit quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) based scheme  @xcite that can generate and detect quantum states of a mechanical resonator  @xcite , where the dc bias is required to strongly couple a nanomechanical resonator to a superconducting qubit .",
    "however , it turns out that having such a dc bias functionality opens up possibilities for other heretofore difficult - to - realize quantum dynamical investigations , one of which we shall focus on here .",
    "we shall in particular investigate the quantum dynamics of the device shown in fig .",
    "[ cavityfig ] , which comprises two josephson junctions ( jj ) in series with a gate electrode , and where the source electrode to one of the jj s contacts the center conductor of the microwave cavity , while the drain electrode from the other jj contacts the ground plane of the microwave cavity .",
    "the following section describes how the microwave cavity design allows the application of a dc voltage bias @xmath0 to the center conductor , while maintaining a very large quality factor of the second microwave mode to which the jj s strongly couple  @xcite . for not too large a @xmath0 bias , the jj s operate in the subgap region as a",
    " cooper pair transistor \" ( cpt ) , where the dc bias generates a tunable oscillating supercurrent through the cpt via the ac josephson effect .",
    "the tunneling cooper pairs will both emit into and absorb photons from the second microwave mode , and it is the resulting coupled cpt - cavity mode quantum dynamics that will be of central interest to us .",
    "related devices comprising one or more jj s embedded in a microwave cavity date back to just a few years following the discovery of the ac josephson effect  @xcite , where classical signatures of the resonant microwave modes of the tunnel junctions themselves , interacting with the alternating tunnel currents , were observed and discussed  @xcite . beginning in the  90 s , investigations addressed the effect of a structured electromagnetic environment with resonant modes on the current - voltage characteristics of dc voltage biased jj s  @xcite . and",
    "more recently , similar investigations involving double jj devices were carried out  @xcite . however , the quality factors of the electromagnetic modes in these devices were small , typically less than 10 , to be contrasted with quality factors exceeding @xmath1 for the present device design  @xcite shown in fig .",
    "[ cavityfig ] . as a consequence ,",
    "emitted microwave photons will now remain in the cavity mode for many cooper pair tunnel oscillation cycles before leaking out of the cavity mode ; it does not make sense to treat the microwave cavity as an electromagnetic environment for the cpt .",
    "instead , the cavity and cpt should be viewed as a strongly - coupled , quantum coherent system .",
    "the cpt - cavity mode device has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled pendulum - oscillator system ( sec .",
    "[ mechanicalsec ] ) .",
    "the corresponding , nonlinear classical dynamical equations exhibit chaotic , as well as aperiodic motions depending on the initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping / noise forces .",
    "thus , the device in principle allows the experimental investigation of the quantum dynamics of a system for which the corresponding classical dynamics is chaotic .",
    "there is a long tradition of using josephson junction devices for investigating macroscopic quantum dynamics in systems with corresponding nonlinear classical equations  @xcite .",
    "the sussex group carried out some of the first , pioneering work in the ",
    "80 s  @xcite , which was followed by the demonstration of quantum tunneling by the clarke group at berkeley  @xcite , and which culminated in demonstrations over a decade later of superposition states by the lukens  @xcite and mooij  @xcite groups at stonybrook and delft , respectively .",
    "subsequent , related developments have largely focussed on the realization of superconducting quantum bits for quantum computing applications  @xcite , although jj devices still occasionally are used for exploring macroscopic quantum dynamics and the transition to classical dynamics  @xcite .",
    "a large body of theoretical work concerning the quantum - classical correspondence for driven systems has focused on the duffing and other anharmonic oscillators  @xcite , as well as on various rigid rotor models  @xcite ; many insights have been gained by investigating dynamical properties using a quantum phase space ( i.e. , wigner or husimi function  @xcite ) description , and by examining the floquet states and associated quasienergy spectra .",
    "however , relevant experimental results have been few  @xcite .",
    "one of the key difficulties is that most experimental realisations require an _ external _ ac signal to drive the system , which can be one of the most significant sources of noise , preventing the system from displaying manifest quantum dynamical behavior .",
    "in contrast , the cpt - resonator system in fig .  [ cavityfig ] generates its own ac drive , i.e. , it self - oscillates . as a consequence of the ac - josephson effect",
    ", only a dc voltage bias @xmath0 is required , and by varying @xmath0 , the drive frequency can be tuned . since it is considerably easier to noise filter a dc bias line than an ac - drive line , the device described here has considerable promise for exhibiting macroscopic quantum dynamical behavior .",

    "a microwave photon approaching either dc biasing `` t '' junction will therefore see a short circuit ( the low impedance of the main line ) in parallel with a large impedance ( the dc bias line ) and to first order the cavity photons will be unaffected by the presence of the dc bias lines .",

    "<S> we investigate the quantum versus classical dynamics of a microwave cavity - coupled - cooper pair transistor ( cpt ) system , where an applied dc bias causes the system to self - oscillate via the ac josephson effect . </S>",
    "<S> varying the dc bias allows the self - oscillation frequency to be tuned . </S>",
    "<S> an unusual feature of the system design is that the dc bias does not significantly affect the high quality factor of the cavity mode to which the cpt predominantly couples . </S>",
    "<S> the cpt - cavity mode system has a mechanical analogue involving a driven coupled pendulum - oscillator system . the corresponding , nonlinear classical dynamical equations exhibit chaotic , as well as aperiodic motions depending on the initial conditions and the nature and strengths of the damping / noise forces . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum master equation exhibits such phenomena as dynamical tunnelling and the generation of nonclassical states from initial classical states . obviating the need for an external ac - drive line , which typically is harder to noise filter than a dc bias line , the self - oscillating system described here has considerable promise for demonstrating macroscopic quantum dynamical behavior . </S>"
