    "gross @xcite has recently pointed out the attention on the fact that a microcanonical description of systems which may display phase transitions is in general more adequate than the traditional canonical one .",
    "this is because the canonical description may `` smear out '' important information contained in the microcanonical description which is richer @xcite .",
    "for example negative specific heats , which have recently been observed experimentally in mesoscopic systems @xcite , can be accounted for in the microcanonical ensemble but not in the canonical one @xcite .",
    "indeed it is well known that canonical ensemble and microcanonical ensemble are not in general equivalent , even when the thermodynamic limit is considered @xcite .",
    "the statistical mechanical analysis of physical systems based on canonical ensemble is quite well established and universally agreed upon .",
    "roughly speaking one has to compute the partition function @xmath0 and derive the thermodynamics of the system from the free energy @xmath1 .",
    "things are not quite so broadly agreed upon in the case of the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "in fact since the pioneering works of boltzmann and gibbs two possibilities were given for the microcanonical analysis of physical systems , which correspond to two different definitions of entropy ( see for example the textbook of gibbs @xcite or the more recent textbook of huang @xcite ) . following @xcite and",
    "@xcite we shall refer to these two entropies as `` surface entropy '' and `` volume entropy '' .",
    "the surface entropy is defined as : is equal to @xmath2 . ]",
    "@xmath3 where @xmath4 with @xmath5 denoting dirac delta function .",
    "sometimes this is also referred to as boltzmann entropy or boltzmann - planck entropy .",
    "the volume entropy is defined as : @xmath6 where @xmath7 with @xmath8 denoting heaviside step function .",
    "the quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related through the differential equation @xcite : @xmath11 where the prime symbol denotes derivation with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "these entropies are named surface entropy and volume entropy because they are calculated as the logarithm of the area of the hyper - surface of constant energy in phase space and the volume of phase space that it encloses respectively .    with reference to the literature about microcanonical phase transitions",
    "the surface entropy is certainly the most popular .",
    "for example barr _ et .",
    "@xcite method based on large deviation techniques uses the surface entropy .",
    "the surface entropy is used also in rugh s microcanonical formalism adopted in ref .",
    "the strongest advocate of surface entropy is perhaps gross @xcite .",
    "nonetheless pioneers of microcanonical phase transitions , such as thirring @xcite and lynden - bell @xcite , used the volume entropy .",
    "the two entropies coincide in the thermodynamic limit but when the number of degrees of freedom of the system under study is small relevant differences may appear , therefore it is necessary to choose properly .",
    "some authors @xcite have already pointed out that the surface entropy is not adequate when dealing with small systems because it does not account properly for finite - size effects . on the other hand",
    "there is a number of theoretical reasons to prefer the volume entropy when the number of degrees of freedom becomes small .",
    "here we shall review these reasons and we will illustrate the employment of the volume entropy in the study of phase transition with a small lennard - jones chain which displays a region of negative heat capacity .",
    "in this section we will summarize some old and recent results concerning the volume entropy .",
    "these results indicate that , no matter the number of degrees of freedom of the system under study , the volume entropy always provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy .",
    "for example helmholtz @xcite proved that the logarithm of the area enclosed in phase space by the trajectory of a 1-dimensional system ( i.e. , the 1d volume entropy @xmath13 ) provides a mechanical analogue of physical entropy in the sense that if one considers the quantities @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the kinetic energy , @xmath17 is an external parameter on which the hamiltonian depends and @xmath18 denotes time average , then , @xmath19 this result , known as helmholtz theorem @xcite , says that the volume entropy is a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy in the sense that it reproduces exactly the fundamental law of thermodynamics ( i.e. the _ heat theorem _ ( [ eq : heattheo ] ) ) .",
    "the helmholtz theorem has been recently generalized to multi - dimensional ergodic ( i.e. metrically indecomposable ) systems ( see ref",
    ". @xcite or ref .",
    "@xcite for a different but equivalent approach ) .",
    "the resulting generalized helmholtz theorem essentially states that the volume entropy reproduces the heat theorem _ no matter the number of degrees of freedom @xmath20_. the same can not be said about surface entropy which has been proved to reproduce it only up to corrections of the order @xmath21 @xcite . as a matter of fact",
    "gibbs presents the volume entropy in his celebrated _ principles of statistical mechanics _ @xcite as the entropy that naturally satisfies the fundamental principle of thermodynamics ( that is the heat theorem ) @xcite .",
    "hertz @xcite pointed out that the volume entropy is an adiabatic invariant already in 1910 , and based his approach to statistical mechanics on it . among the textbooks that adopt the same approach , those of mnster @xcite , becker @xcite , and the more recent book of berdichevsky @xcite are worth mentioning .",
    "adiabatic invariance is another good property of volume entropy because it reproduces quite well clausius requirement that `` for every quasi static process in a thermally isolated system which begins and ends in an equilibrium state , the entropy of the final state is equal to that of the initial state '' @xcite .",
    "of course the surface entropy is not an adiabatic invariant , although it becomes approximately such as the number of degrees of freedom increases @xcite .",
    "very recently it has been also proved that non - adiabatic transformations occurring in isolated systems which are initially in a state of thermal equilibrium always result in an increase of the expectation value of the volume entropy @xcite .",
    "this result too does hold _ no matter the number of degrees of freedom @xmath20 _ and can not be proved in general for surface entropy .",
    "thus the volume entropy explains quite satisfactorily also clausius law of entropy increase `` for every non quasi static process in a thermally isolated system which begins and ends in an equilibrium state , the entropy of the final state is greater than that of the initial state '' @xcite .",
    "recently more and more authors are becoming aware of the theoretical value of volume entropy .",
    "for example , on the basis of a laplace transform technique for the microcanonical ensemble , pearson _ et .",
    "@xcite reached the conclusion that the volume entropy `` is the most correct definition for the entropy , even though it is unimportant for any explicit numerical calculation '' , meaning that in the thermodynamic limit the difference with surface entropy becomes negligible . on the other hand for small system",
    ", such intrinsic correctness of the volume entropy becomes very important .",
    "adib @xcite argues that the finite size corrections to surface entropy found in ref .",
    "@xcite would be unneeded if the volume entropy were used instead .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the volume entropy has another property that is particularly important for small systems which have negative heat capacity , namely it is a naturally _ nonextensive _ entropy . according to lynden - bell @xcite , in fact",
    ", systems with negative heat capacity are necessarily _ nonextensive_. the property of nonextensivity of volume entropy follows directly from the composition rule of enclosed volumes , @xmath22 @xmath23 , of two systems with total energy @xmath24 @xcite : @xmath25 which is not a simple multiplication but a form of convolution which accounts for all possible partitions of energies between the two systems .",
    "it has to be stressed that , despite of what is often stated in literature , the surface entropy is nonextensive too , as the composition rule for surface integrals @xmath26 is the convolution , not the multiplication @xcite : @xmath27    in sum , the volume entropy accounts for certain basic principles of thermodynamics , like the heat theorem and clausius formulation of the second law equally well for large and small systems , whereas the surface entropy accounts for them only in the case of large system .",
    "for this reason it is the most appropriate _ mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy _ when dealing with small systems .",
    "according to the helmholtz theorem @xcite the mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy of a one dimensional system is @xmath28 where @xmath29 denote the turning points of the trajectory .",
    "if the potential is such that there is only one trajectory per energy level ( ergodicity ) , then @xmath13 satisfies eq .",
    "( [ eq : heattheo ] ) @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , if the system has more than one trajectory per energy level for a certain range of energies and the system is on _ one _ of them , still we can use the above formula and say that the heat theorem is satisfied as long as the energies considered lye within that energy range . in this case @xmath30 and @xmath31 would be calculated as time averages over the _ actual _ trajectory and @xmath13 would be given by the area enclosed by _ that _ trajectory only .",
    "let us illustrate this with a practical example .",
    "let us consider a 1d chain composed of three particles which interact via a lennard - jones potential .",
    "let us fix the position of two of them and let us place the third one in between , so that the first two particles act as walls of a 1d box .",
    "let us now study the behavior of the particle inside the box .",
    "let the interaction potential be : @xmath32 and let us place the `` walls '' at @xmath33 .",
    "then the particle in the box is subject to the following potential : @xmath34 for values of @xmath17 larger than a certain critical value @xmath35 , this system has a critical energy @xmath36 such that for energy below @xmath37 ergodicity is broken and there are two trajectories per energy level . above @xmath38 the dynamics is ergodic and there is only one trajectory per energy level .     in a lennard - jones box of size @xmath39 .",
    "the separatrix corresponds to the critical energy @xmath40 . below the critical energy",
    "there are two distinct trajectories ( the dynamics is not ergodic).,width=8 ]    figure [ fig : phasespace ] shows a contour plot of various energy levels in phase space for a particle of mass @xmath41 in the lennard - jones box of size @xmath39 . for energy @xmath42 we have a separatrix . below @xmath38 the curve of constant energy splits into two disconnected curves , whereas for values of @xmath12 larger than @xmath38 we have only one curve . below the critical energy the volume integral @xmath10 is given by the area enclosed by",
    "_ one _ of the two possible trajectories .",
    "as the energy crosses the critical value the integral @xmath10 jumps discontinuously . in formulae we have : @xmath43 \\nonumber\\\\ \\times   \\int \\left[2m(e-\\varphi(x , v))\\right]^{1/2}_+ dx\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the symbol @xmath44^{1/2}_+$ ] denotes a function that is equal to @xmath45 for @xmath46 and is null otherwise .",
    "the volume entropy , which is calculated by taking the logarithm of the expression above , then displays a jump at the critical energy as well .     in a lennard - jones box of size @xmath39",
    "the discontinuity of entropy at the critical energy signals a discontinuous phase transition.,width=8 ]    figure [ fig : entropy ] shows a plot of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath12 , for the values @xmath41 and @xmath39 .",
    "the critical energy is @xmath40 .     in a lennard - jones box of size @xmath39 .",
    "the curve displays a region of negative specific heat . at the critical energy the temperature goes to zero.,width=8 ]",
    "figure [ fig : temperature ] shows the temperature plotted against the energy calculated , according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : heattheo ] ) , as : @xmath48 there is a region of negative slope in the graph which correspond to a _ negative heat capacity_.",
    "the example provided in the previous section is perhaps too simple to be of interest to any specific physical problem .",
    "nonetheless it illustrates qualitatively the mechanism of microcanonical phase transition as captured by the volume entropy .",
    "such phase transitions are associated with the crossing of separatrix trajectories , for which the dynamics of the system has no finite time scale .",
    "the figures show neatly that at the separatrix energy the entropy has a discontinuous jump , the temperature goes to zero , and for energies below the critical energy we have a region of negative heat capacity .",
    "these are not specific features of the system studied potential studied with volume entropy @xcite and has been predicted for the pendulum @xcite . ] .",
    "whenever a separatrix is crossed there is a sudden _ open - up _ of a larger portion of phase space for the trajectory to _ enclose _ which leads to a discontinuity in the entropy .",
    "further , at the separatrix , the period of motion , which for a well known theorem of classical mechanics is given by @xmath49 @xcite , becomes infinite .",
    "therefore the temperature , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath50 goes to zero . since the temperature @xmath51 is definite positive , below the critical energy there _",
    "necessarily _ is a region of negative slope , that is negative heat capacity .",
    "the appearance of a negative heat capacity is associated with a convex intruder in the entropy ( see fig . [",
    "fig : entropy - inset ] ) which signals the approach to the separatrix from below .",
    "it is important to notice that using the surface entropy would lead to a _ drastically different _ result . in this case",
    "the temperature would be calculated as @xmath52 , which might not tend to zero at the critical energy !",
    "note also that @xmath53 is not proportional to the average kinetic energy and can be negative .",
    "therefore , in agreement with ref . @xcite we believe that surface entropy is not suited for low dimensional systems with broken ergodicity .    the volume entropy could be used to address microcanonical phase transitions in small dimensional systems with either long or short range interactions , like the @xmath54 model , chains of particles interacting via lennard - jones potential @xcite or the hamiltonian mean field model @xcite .",
    "all these models are expected to undergo a breaking of ergodicity @xcite , thus there are separatrix trajectories and possible phase transitions that the volume entropy can detect .",
    "the advantage of using the volume entropy is that it provides a good mechanical analogue of thermodynamic entropy even for small system , thus accounting properly for the finite - size effects . as the development of technology is allowing experimentalists to probe the thermodynamic behavior of smaller and smallers systems",
    ", this is becoming an increasingly important task .",
    "the main limitation of the present approach is that it is restricted to classical statistical mechanics , thus it does not account for quantum - mechanical phenomena ."
