    "one of the most intriguing discovery of modern cosmology is the acceleration of the universe @xcite and it is widely believed that dark energy of repulsive nature is causing the current acceleration .",
    "many candidates of the dark energy have been proposed @xcite , among which the cosmological constant is the most accepted one . along with yet another unidentified constituent of the universe called dark matter , they compose standard cosmological model , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the observable universe can be well addressed with the @xmath1 model .",
    "still , extreme fine - tuning of the cosmological constant @xcite has been unsatisfactory feature of the model .",
    "that is , the current cosmological constant must have an the unnaturally small value compared to planck scale .",
    "an alternative proposal to explain the dark energy is the quintessence model @xcite in which a scalar field is added as an indispensable component of the universe . in this approach ,",
    "the smallness of the cosmological constant is achieved by a dynamical decay of the scalar field energy density .",
    "it has the very attractive features of tracking behavior and attractor solutions @xcite such that galaxy formation is not affected too much by the quintessence field and the dark energy becomes dominant only at the late stage of the universe causing the current acceleration .",
    "however , in order to achieve the late time dark energy dominance , thus providing a possible solution of the coincidence problem @xcite , the theory has to be fine - tuned to a certain extent such that the energy density today must be very close to the critical density @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose a dark energy model which can alleviate the fine - tuning problem substantially .",
    "suppose a decaying cosmological term @xcite according to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the scale factor of the universe @xcite .",
    "we regard it as the size of the universe .",
    "this term decreases with the expansion of the universe , and the current value is @xmath4 with @xmath5 , where we assumed that its value at the planck scale is of the order @xmath6 note that energy density of the cosmological constant from this value is very close too the critical density @xmath7 and it has the potential of explaining the coincidence problem without fine - tuning .",
    "also , some theoretical background was given for such a decay @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the conservation of the einstein tensor prevents the cosmological term to be varying in pure gravity .",
    "if matter contents are included , the varying cosmological constant term disrupts the matter continuity equations , which changes the predictions of the standard cosmology in the matter - dominated epoch @xcite .",
    "however , if continuity equation is being enforced , @xmath8 term behaves exactly like the curvature constant term and it alone can not yield an accelerating universe    it turns out that by adding another cosmological term which varies according to @xmath9 to the original @xmath8 , accelerating universe can be realized . to see this in detail ,",
    "let us first check the energy dominance of each epoch .",
    "we start from @xmath10 and the matter energy density @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the energy density of the cosmological fluid composed of those two terms was approximately of the order of @xmath12 when the inflation started .",
    "at the end of the inflation when the scale factor becomes @xmath13 cm with the number of @xmath14-foldings given by @xmath15 , the energy density would have decreased in magnitude by a factor of @xmath16 and becomes of the order of @xmath17 .",
    "we choose @xmath18 which is bigger than the minimum number of e - foldings @xcite so that the energy density becomes of the order of @xmath19 and therefore we propose the following dark energy density @xmath20 \\times 10^{-72}{\\rm m_{p}}^4,\\label{ded}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constants   \\times 10^{-72}{\\rm m_{p}}^4.$ ] @xmath23 and @xmath24 satisfy the continuity equation , @xmath25 . ] and @xmath26 .",
    "note that the number @xmath27 is a dynamical consequence of the inflation and it turns out that no extreme fine - tuning of @xmath21 and @xmath22 are necessary to describe the current accelerating universe . comparing with @xmath28 @xcite , we have a relation @xmath29 just after the inflation ended at the energy scale @xmath30 , the energy density is of the order of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "the normal expansion takes over and the universe expands by a factor of @xmath34 until the radiation - matter equality around @xmath35 . when this occurs , @xmath36 , and the matter dominance takes over since the radiation energy density decays faster than the matter energy density .",
    "in the meantime , the magnitude of @xmath23 keeps on decreasing according to ( [ ded ] ) , and becomes of the order of @xmath37 therefore , the dark energy is completely subdominant during this period .",
    "then , the matter - dominated epoch began around @xmath38 .",
    "since , the matter energy density decays faster than dark energy , there exist a scale where @xmath39 given by @xmath40\\simeq \\gamma .",
    "\\label{ded2 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    so far , there is only one restriction on the numerical values of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 of ( [ ded1 ] ) , and a wide range of their values are allowed to fit into the current observation .",
    "one can impose one more condition by demanding that the universe has begun its acceleration very recently . the acceleration equation with our @xmath23 and @xmath24",
    "is given by @xmath41\\rho_{cr}.\\label{acceqmo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the next sections , we will show that this equation can be realized within a couple of quintessence models at very low energy . from the above equation",
    ", we see that the acceleration began around @xmath42 . for example , if we choose @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "this would determine @xmath46 therefore , the transition to dark energy dominance occurred very recently . with these values , the dark energy stays negative during most of the time until @xmath47 and becomes positive at late stage of the matter - dominated era . after passing this point a maximum ,",
    "@xmath48 is reached , and eventually , it begin to be dominant around @xmath49 .",
    "it seems that a priori there is no reason for it to stay positive always as long as the total energy density @xmath50 or @xmath51 remains positive .",
    "in addition , absolute value of the energy density is very small when it stays negative compared to the radiation or matter energy density .",
    "therefore , it should not disturb the radiation- or matter - dominated evolution to alter the course of it   independently of the detailed numerical values for @xmath52 and @xmath53 . ] .",
    "note that the increasing behavior of dark energy , although limited until @xmath48 in our case , also appears in the phantom model @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to check that @xmath54 all happen very recently without too much fine - tuning of the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 .    in sec .",
    "2 , we construct a quintessence model with four scalar fields which can produce the dark energy behavior of ( [ ded ] ) at very low energy .",
    "an explicit form of the potential in terms of the scalar field in the scalar - dominated region is given . in sec .",
    "3 , we consider a generalized quintessence model where the explicit construction can be extended to matter - dominated epoch . in sec",
    ". 4 , a critical analysis of the generalized quintessence model is performed .",
    "5 contains conclusion and discussions .",
    "let us consider an action of the form ( @xmath55 ) @xmath56 + s_m \\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath57 where @xmath58 is an 3 component scalar field and @xmath59 is a parameter which we assume to be constant .",
    "@xmath60 ia a matter action with @xmath61 the spacetime metric tensor is given by @xmath62 where @xmath3 is the scale factor .",
    "with ansatz for the scalar field @xmath58 of the form @xmath63 @xcite , the evolution and the continuity equation for matter are given as follows ; @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a hubble parameter , @xmath66 is the matter energy density .",
    "the scalar field satisfies @xmath67 where the dot and prime denote partial differentiations with respect to @xmath68 and @xmath69 , respectively .",
    "taking linear combinations of ( [ scfeqa ] ) and ( [ scfeqb ] ) , one gets the acceleration equation @xmath70 in the quintessence model , the kinetic term and matter density decay very fast in the above equation ( [ sctenaccrate ] ) , and sole potential dominance at late time is reached which causes the acceleration .",
    "we open the possibility that the late time acceleration comes from the first two terms in the above equation , and anticipating ( [ sctenaccrate ] ) to describe the current acceleration at very low energy , we require the following relation ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 is a parameter which we assume to be the positive . with this , the expansion changes from the deceleration for the small value of the scale factor corresponding to the matter - dominated epoch to an acceleration for the large value corresponding to the scalar - dominated epoch including the kinetic energy density .",
    "we will omit @xmath73 and @xmath52 in what follows unless confusion arises . using the relation ( [ ourchooseansantz ] ) , the evolution equations  ( [ scfeqa ] ) and ( [ scfeqb ] ) can be rewritten as follows : @xmath74 differentiating equation ( [ scfeqaa ] ) with respect to time and comparing with ( [ scfeqbb ] ) , we obtain the following first - order differential equation for the potential @xmath75 which yields @xmath76 which is precisely of the form ( [ ded ] ) . from equation ( [ scfeqaa ] ) , we define ( with @xmath77 , see eq .",
    "( [ messia ] ) and below ) @xmath78 comparing with eq .",
    "( [ ded ] ) , we obtain @xmath79    note that it is difficult to express the scalar field @xmath69 in a closed form from the equation ( [ ourchooseansantz ] ) , @xmath80 so the potential @xmath81 can not be expressed in terms of the @xmath69 explicitly . also , positivity of the square root in the above expression restricts the applicable range of @xmath82 which turns out to be @xmath83 , which is the same as the positivity of the @xmath84 of ( [ energyded ] ) .",
    "basically , this comes from the imposition of the acceleration condition ( [ ourchooseansantz ] ) , and this condition restricts the dynamically permitted region to @xmath85 a closed form of the potential is viable , if we neglect the matter density in the evolution equations , that is , in the scalar - dominated epoch .",
    "in this case , the ratio of @xmath86 and @xmath87 is given by @xmath88 and we can adjust the parameter @xmath89 . then , we have @xmath90 with an integration constant @xmath91 .",
    "this gives the the following expression for the potential @xmath92 where the term involving the constant @xmath93 are absorbed into @xmath72 and @xmath94 .",
    "in this section , we consider a generalized quintessence model given by @xmath95 + s_m \\ , , \\label{gqm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced a scalar function @xmath96 which will be arranged for our purpose .",
    "the last term in the gravity sector is the triplet of scalar fields as before , and we choose the same ansatz of the form @xmath63 , which solves the equation of motion .",
    "the potential @xmath97 takes the following form @xmath98 it is essentially of the form given by ( [ sctensolvscdom ] ) with a redefinition of the scalar field .",
    "we assume the matter to be a cold dark matter with @xmath99 as before and satisfies the continuity equation .",
    "the evolution equations are given by @xmath100 along with the continuity equation ( [ scfeqc ] ) and the scalar field satisfies @xmath101    taking linear combinations of ( [ scteneqa ] ) and ( [ scteneqb ] ) , one gets the acceleration equation @xmath102 we choose the same acceleration condition as before @xmath103 with a positive @xmath72 .",
    "note that eqs .",
    "( [ scteneqa ] ) and ( [ scteneqb ] ) imply ( [ scteneqscalar ] ) and recall @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , we have two independent dynamical equations and one constraint ( [ sctenchoose ] ) for the three unknown functions to be determined , @xmath3 or @xmath105 , @xmath96 , and @xmath106 .",
    "it turns out that we can solve the equations with the ansatz @xmath107 which reproduces the same forms of the scale factor dependent potential ( [ scfsolva ] ) and energy density ( [ energyded ] ) . inserting this ansatz into ( [ sctenchoose ] )",
    ", we obtain the following @xmath108 in terms of @xmath69 @xmath109 note that for the choice of @xmath77 , @xmath110 for positive value of the energy density @xmath84 defined with the first three terms of eq .",
    "( [ scteneqa ] ) as before .",
    "one can show that for @xmath111 , @xmath96 is always greater than zero for @xmath112 the above analysis shows that it is possible to construct an explicit form of the potential beyond the scalar - dominated region if we introduce a generalized quintessence model with an adjustable kinetic function @xmath113",
    "in this section , we perform the critical analysis @xcite of the evolution equations of the previous section and present some numerical result . for convenience , we choose @xmath114 . for other choices ,",
    "the qualitative feature of the stability does not change as long as @xmath111 .",
    "let us introduce the following dimensionless quantities @xmath115 with @xmath116 then the equations ( [ scteneqa])-([scteneqscalar ] ) can be written in the following form @xmath117 where @xmath118 and together with a constraint equation @xmath119 the critical points of the above system are easily obtained by setting the right - hand sides of the above equations ( [ criticaldx ] ) and ( [ criticaldy ] ) to zero .",
    "the only physically meaningful critical points @xmath120 of the system are @xmath121 point ( a ) corresponds to the matter - dominated point , whereas point ( b ) is a scalar - dominates one .    to gain some insight into the property of the critical points , we write the variables near the critical points @xmath120 in the form @xmath122 where @xmath123 and @xmath124 are perturbations around the critical points . from ( [ criticaldx ] ) and ( [ criticaldy ] )",
    ", we obtain the linearized equations @xmath125 which can be written by using a matrix @xmath126 : @xmath127 one can study the stability of critical points against perturbations by evaluating the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath126 . for class @xmath128",
    "corresponding to the matter dominated epoch , one has @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which means that it is an unstable point . for class @xmath131 corresponding to the scalar field dominated epoch ,",
    "we obtain @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the appearance of zero eigenvalue means that the linear perturbation , which leads to the matrix ( [ criticalmatrix ] ) , is not adequate and we must consider the higher order perturbations to determine whether the considered critical point is stable or not .",
    "first note that we have @xmath134 for @xmath135 therefore , it is useful to change from the @xmath136 to new variables @xmath137 defined as @xmath138 where the @xmath139 , @xmath140 are positively defined , and then ( [ criticaldx ] ) and ( [ criticaldy ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath141 and corresponding critical points in terms of the new variables are : @xmath142    in the higher order perturbations , we write the variables near the critical points @xmath143 in the form @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath146 are @xmath147-th order perturbations of the variables near the critical points . for class @xmath131 , the perturbative equations of each order are given by @xmath148 note that the right hand side of the second equation in the first order perturbation equation is zero which reflects the fact that one of two eigenvalues is zero and we must focus on the next - order equations .",
    "the solutions of the above linear differential equations are given by @xmath149 with @xmath150 + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4 ) \\",
    "\\delta b_2 & = & { 3\\over5}\\delta   y_0 \\delta\\alpha_0 e^{-n}\\biggr ( 1 + { 3\\over5}e^{-n}\\delta\\alpha_0 -2n \\delta y_0 \\biggr ) + { \\cal o}(\\epsilon^4)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the initial values at @xmath153 that satisfy the @xmath154 , @xmath155 , and @xmath156 is the infinitesimal order parameter for the perturbation . if the higher order terms are included and when @xmath15 becomes very large , @xmath157 can be expressed in a closed form with @xmath158 since the variable @xmath140 is a positively defined value , perturbation around the zero point must be also positive . in this case ,",
    "@xmath159 and @xmath160 smoothly go to zero when @xmath15 goes infinity .",
    "therefore , critical point ( b ) is stable .",
    "numerical result is given in fig . 1 which demonstrates the stability of the scalar - dominated critical point .",
    "[ 0.55 ]   for different initial values .",
    "we have drawn the physically allowed region with @xmath161 .",
    "the left red dot is the matter - dominated point ( a ) , whereas the right red dot is the scalar - dominated point ( b).,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "we showed that the coincidence problem can be avoided with logarithmic cosmological fluid of the form ( [ ded ] ) , and this can be realized dynamically as a couple of quintessence models at very low energy . among the four scalar fields scalar fields , one of the scalar fields play a major role as in the standard quintessence model causing the current acceleration ,",
    "whereas the triplet of scalar fields is not essential in dynamical evolution but it can provide the necessary energy density such that the potential is completely integrable as an exact expression in the dark - energy dominated era . in the generalized quintessence model , the construction was extended to matter - dominated epoch , and critical analysis indicates that the scalar - domination is dynamically stable .",
    "an analytic expression of the potential in terms of the scalar field is unavailable in each case , but effective field theories could be be considered separately at each stage of the evolution of the universe .",
    "we also have checked that in such a scheme , the current value of extremely small dark energy density can be obtained without much fine - tuning ; the constants @xmath21 and @xmath22 are only of the order @xmath162 and @xmath163 , and the small value is attributed to its decaying according to essentially as @xmath8 .",
    "comparing with the quintessence model , the constraint ( [ ourchooseansantz ] ) brings a crucial difference as far as energy dominance is concerned .",
    "when the scalar field begins to roll down the potential , the initial potential energy is converted into kinetic energy which dominates the energy of the scalar field .",
    "but the kinetic energy decreases rapidly and the potential energy dominance takes over around @xmath164 , which is responsible for the dark energy domination . in our case , at the very low energy eq .",
    "( [ ourchooseansantz ] ) maintains throughout the evolution , and it implies that kinetic energy does not decay fast , but it remains comparable with potential energy @xmath165 .",
    "this would result in a relatively small absolute value for the equation of state @xmath166 , but detailed comparison with the observational data needs to be done .",
    "we comment that this constraint is a phenomenological input to conform to the current acceleration , and a more theoretical basis is required .",
    "another comment is the feature that the dark energy density remains negative during most of the time until @xmath167 .",
    "even though this behavior does not destroy the accelerating universe , there seems to be no special meaning to @xmath168 in the evolution .",
    "it needs to be addressed how the matter - dominated evolution is effected by the small negative energy , if any .",
    "one could get rid of the negative energy simply by modifying the dark energy density into @xmath23=-rhs of ( [ ded ] ) for @xmath169 , but it seems rather ad - hoc . if this scale could somehow be raised to electro - weak breaking scale , this could endow more flexibility to the theory . adding @xmath170 term to the dark energy density ( [ ded ] )",
    "is another possible avenue to deal with the negative energy .",
    "it is likely that this will also extend the applicable range of the quintessence model similarly constructed , and might also improve the equation of state previously mentioned .",
    "we conclude with an intriguing property of ( [ ded ] ) .",
    "one can check that that the status current accelerating universe is rather insensitive to the numerical values of @xmath171 and @xmath172 chosen .",
    "if these values are chosen differently , these changes can be always reabsorbed into @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "suppose we change @xmath52 into @xmath173 with some constant @xmath59 .",
    "then , eqs .",
    "( [ ded ] ) and ( [ acceqmo ] ) retain the same form with @xmath174 , and @xmath175 . likewise ,",
    "if @xmath176 , then , @xmath177 , and @xmath178 . since @xmath59 and @xmath179 can be at most of the order 1 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 can change in maximum by an order of 2 , and fine - tuning problem does not arise . and these changes do not alter the energy dominances of radiation epoch and matter epoch .",
    "this especially means that @xmath180 can be made in fact independent on @xmath53 without much fine - tuning , suggesting that the current status of the universe is not effected too much by the early universe .",
    "similarly , the scaling of the scale factor itself can also be absorbed into new definition of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , which seems to suggest a kind of scaling behavior of the dark energy proposed .",
    "it would be interesting if some theoretical foundation could be given for it .",
