    "there is strong evidence in favor of a dark matter dominated universe : locally , from the rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) or the bullet cluster ( @xcite ) and on the largest scales , from cosmological observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "most of the matter in the universe consists of cold non - baryonic dark matter ( cdm ) , the leading candidate for this class of yet undiscovered particles ( wimp ) being the lightest supersymmetric particle . in various supersymmetric scenarii ( susy ) , this neutral and colorless particle is the lightest neutralino @xmath2 . + tremendous experimental efforts on a host of techniques have been made in the field of direct search of non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "several detectors already reached sufficient sensitivity to begin to test regions of the susy parameter space .",
    "however , going further required careful choice of radiopurity of materials , underground laboratory , shielding , detector design and data analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "as the expected event rates are very small ( @xmath3 ) , the challenge is to distinguish a geniune wimp signal from backgrounds ( mainly neutrons and @xmath4-rays ) .",
    "two main dark matter search strategies may be identified : the detector may be designed to reach an extremely high level of background rejection or to provide an unambigious positive signal .",
    "this can be achieved via :    * a dependence of the differential event rate on the atomic mass of the target nucleus , requiring a good control of detector systematics , * a correlation of the signal with the motion of the detector with respect to the galactic dark matter halo",
    ". this can either be an annual modulation , due to the motion of the earth around the sun or a strong direction dependence of the incoming neutralino , toward the cygnus constellation to which points the sun s velocity vector ( @xcite ) .",
    "several projects aiming at directionnal detection of dark matter are being  developped ( @xcite ) .",
    "the mimac project is multi - chamber detector for dark matter search .",
    "the idea is to measure both track and ionization with a matrix of micromegas @xmath0tpc filled with  and @xmath1 .",
    "the use of these two gases is motivated by their privileged features for dark matter search . with their odd atomic number",
    ", a detector made of such targets will be sensitive to the spin - dependent interaction , leading to a natural complementarity with existing detectors mainly sensitive to scalar interaction , in various susy models , e.g. non - universal susy ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , as shown in ( @xcite ) , a 10 kg  dark matter detector with a 1 kev threshold ( mimac ) would present a sensitivity to susy models allowed by present cosmology and accelerator constraints .",
    "this study highlights the complementarity of this experiment with most of current spin - dependent experiments : proton based detectors as well as @xmath5 telescopes .",
    "+ using both  and @xmath1 in a patchy matrix of @xmath0tpc opens the possibility to compare rates for two atomic masses , and to study neutralino interaction separately with neutrons and protons as the spin content of these nuclei is dominated by one kind of nucleon .",
    "+ low pressure operation of the mimac detector will enable the possibility to discriminate neutralino signal and background on the basis of track shape and incoming direction .",
    "as far as detection of dark matter is concerned , the ionization is one of the most important channels ; heat , scintillation and tracking being the others . the ionization quenching factor ( iqf ) is defined as the fraction of energy released through ionization by a recoil in a medium compared with its kinetic energy .",
    "measuring iqf , especially at low energies , is a key point for dark matter detectors , since it is needed to evaluate the nucleus recoil energy and hence the wimp kinematics .",
    "+ the energy released by a particle in a medium produces in an interrelated way three different processes : i ) ionization , producing a number of electron - ion pairs , ii ) scintillation , producing a number of photons through de - excitation of quasi - molecular states and iii ) heat produced essentially by the motion of nuclei and electrons .",
    "the fraction of energy given to electrons has been estimated theoretically ( @xcite ) and parametrized by ( @xcite ) .",
    "+ in the last decades an important effort has been made to measure the iqf in different materials : gases ( @xcite ) , solids ( @xcite ) and liquids ( @xcite ) , using different techniques . the use of a monoenergetic neutron beam has been explored in solids with success ( @xcite ) .",
    "however in the low energy range the measurements are rare or absent for many targets ( e.g. helium ) due to ionization threshold of detectors and experimental constraints .",
    "+ we have develop an experimental setup devoted to the measurement of low energy ( kev ) ionization quenching factor .",
    "the purpose is twofold : measuring for the first time the helium quenching factor and performing very low energy measurements to test the prototype cell ( resolution , threshold , ... ) in the range of interest for dark matter ( below 6 kev ) .",
    "+    tpc used for the quenching factor measurement ( not to scale ) . ]",
    "the experimental set - up is the following : an electron cyclotron resonance ion source ( @xcite ) with an extraction potential from a fraction of one kv up to 50 kv , is coupled to micromegas ( micromesh gaseous ) detector via a @xmath6 hole with a differential pumping .",
    "+ energy values have been previously checked by a time - of - flight measurements through a @xmath7 thick @xmath8 foil ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ionization produced in the gas has been measured with a micromegas ( micromesh gaseous ) detector  ( @xcite ) adapted to a cathode integrated mechanically to the interface of the ion source .",
    "it is a bulk type micromegas ( @xcite ) , in which the grid and the anode are built and integrated with a fixed gap , 128 @xmath9 for measurements between 350 and 1300 mbar .",
    "the electric fields for the drift and the avalanche have been selected to optimize the transparence of the grid and the gain for each ion energy .",
    "typical applied field were @xmath10 for the drift and a voltage of 450 v for the avalanche .",
    "the drift distance between the cathode and the grid was 3 cm , large enough to include the tracks of @xmath11he nuclei of energies up to 50 kev .",
    "these tracks , of the order of 6 mm for 50 kev , are roughly of the same length than the electrons tracks produced by the x - rays emitted by th @xmath12fe source used for calibration . + in order to measure the quenching factor of @xmath11he in a gas mixture of 95% of @xmath11he and 5% of isobutane ( c@xmath13h@xmath14 ) we proceed as follows : i ) the ionization given by the micromegas was calibrated by the two x - rays ( 1.486 and 5.97 kev ) at each working point of the micromegas defined by the drift voltage ( v@xmath15 ) , the gain voltage ( v@xmath16 ) and the pressure , ii ) the number of ions per seconde sent was kept lower than 25 , to prevent any problem of recombination in primary charge collection or space charge effect . +",
    "two different calibration sources have been used : the 1.486 kev x - rays of @xmath17al produced by alpha particles emitted by a source of @xmath18 cm under a thin foil of aluminium and a standard @xmath12fe x - ray source giving the 5.9 kev k@xmath19 and the 6.4 kev k@xmath20 lines .",
    "these two lines , as they were not resolved by our detector , have been considered as a single one of 5.97 kev , taking into account their relative intensities .",
    "the iqf of a recoil will be the ratio between this energy and the kinetic energy of such recoil .",
    "in such a way , the iqf compares the nuclei ionization efficiency with respect to the electrons .",
    "the ionization spectra of 1.5 kev @xmath11he nuclei and of electrons of roughly the same energy ( 1.486 kev ) are shown on figure [ plot2 ] .    he ( left ) and 1.486 kev x - ray of @xmath17al ( right ) in @xmath11he + 5% c@xmath13h@xmath14 mixture at 700 mbar . ]",
    "the measurement reported ( @xcite ) have been focused on the low energy @xmath11he iqf .",
    "figure [ plot2 ] presents the results at 700 mbar compared with the lindhard theory for @xmath11he ions in pure @xmath11he and with respect to the srim simulation ( @xcite ) for @xmath11he in the same gas mixture used during the measurements .",
    "we observe a difference between the srim simulation and the experimental points of up to 20% of the kinetic energy of the nuclei , shown in fig .",
    "[ plot2 ] .",
    "this difference may be assigned to the scintillation produced by the @xmath11he nuclei in @xmath11he gas .",
    "this difference is reduced at lower pressures due to the fact that the amount of scintillation is reduced when the nucleai mean distance is increased giving a lower production probability of eximer states . more details may be found in ( @xcite ) . +",
    "as shown in ( @xcite ) energy resolution of micromegas @xmath0tpc has been measured down to 1 kev . at 6 kev ,",
    "it is of the order of 10% .",
    "moreover , it does not depend on pressure and it does not affect the number of expected events for dark matter , even at low energy .",
    "threshold as low as 300 ev ( ionization ) has been reached .    as presented in ( @xcite ) , measurements have been done in various experimental conditions , showing a clear increase at lower gaz pressure and also at lower isobutane percentage ( the quencher ) .",
    "hence , the ionization signal is expected to increase with helium purity , which is needed for dark matter search , and also at the lowest pressures , which is compulsory for directionnal detection .",
    "+    he kinetic energy ( kev ) .",
    "lindhard theory prediction ( @xmath21 in pure @xmath21 and @xmath22 in pure @xmath22 ) , parametrized as in @xcite , is presented and compared with srim simulation results ( solid line and points ) in the case of @xmath11he in @xmath11he + 5% c@xmath13h@xmath14 mixture .",
    "measured quenching factor are presented at 700 mbar with error bars included mainly dominated by systematic errors .",
    "the differences between data and srim simulation are shown by triangles . ]",
    "in summary , this first measurement of helium ionization in helium down to energies of 1 kev recoil opens the possibility to develop a helium @xmath0tpc for dark matter .",
    "for the next step , measurements of @xmath1 quenching and recoil tracks at low pressure are being investigated ."
