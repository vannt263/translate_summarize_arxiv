    "dwarf galaxies are the lowest mass galaxies in the universe , and are the most common galaxy type .",

    "( des ) are the dominant galaxy population in galaxy clusters , and their evolved nature and abundance makes them ideal targets for detailed study @xcite . their properties and evolution also reveal much about galaxy formation in general , and can serve as a test of cosmological models . according to the widely accepted @xmath1cdm hierarchical merging scenario , dwarf - size dark matter halos are the first to form , and higher mass galaxies are thought to form from the merging of these low - mass systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by studying dwarf galaxies we can therefore potentially study the first galaxies , or at least those galaxies with very simple formation histories",
    "however , it appears that , observationally , the star formation in lower mass galaxies is shut off , or exhausted , later than in giant galaxies or , in other words , that massive galaxies formed earlier and more quickly @xcite .",
    "although seemingly anti - hierarchical , this behaviour can be reproduced in semi - analytic simulations of galaxy formation in a @xmath1cdm cosmology @xcite .",
    "this `` downsizing '' puts the observational study of dwarf and low - mass galaxies into a new focus .",
    "although some des in clusters have old stellar populations , as seen through their globular cluster systems @xcite , it is clear that not all dwarfs have a single formation event , but appear to form in several star formation episodes .",
    "detailed study of dwarfs in groups , especially in the local group , reveals that most des have a broad star formation history , with many appearing to have a star formation burst or event in the past few gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "nearly all of these local group dwarfs also have old stellar populations that date back to roughly the time of reionisation .",
    "these results , however , are based on the study of resolved stellar populations , and more distant dwarfs can not be as easily studied .",
    "based on the velocity distribution of the de population as a whole @xcite , and on their stellar populations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , evidence accumulated to date suggests that des in nearby clusters have a mixed origin .",
    "some have properties consistent with an old primordial formation , while others appear to be more recently formed from accreted field galaxies .",
    "it is thus becoming clear that des are not just small es with simple , old and metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "an independent test of the star formation history of galaxies comes from their integrated stellar populations and , more specifically , from their [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios @xcite . since @xmath0 elements , such as mg , are mainly produced on short timescales by type  ii supernovae , while most of the fe is formed later by type  ia supernovae , the observed super - solar [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios in giant ellipticals ( es ) is attributed to short formation timescales .",
    "the observed correlation of [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratio and galaxy mass is again a manifestation of the downsizing @xcite .",
    "@xcite were the first to recognise that virgo des are consistent with solar [ @xmath0/fe ] abundance ratios , pointing to a more gradual chemical evolution in low - mass systems .",
    "later studies have confirmed these results and also found that on average , des have lower metallicities and younger ages than normal es @xcite .",
    "scenarios for the formation and evolution of des are still actively debated . on the one hand ,",
    "internal processes play a role , mainly through supernova feedback . on the other hand , because of their low masses , the properties of dwarf galaxies are expected to depend strongly on the environment they reside in .",
    "for example , the morphology - density relation , also observed for massive galaxies , is indeed very strong for low - mass galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "supernova feedback regulates and/or suppresses star formation , eventually leading to gas exhaustion through star formation and/or to gas expulsion through galactic winds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "invoking only internal processes can reproduce observed structural and kinematical correlations for des @xcite , but of course not the morphology - density relation . in a dense environment a variety of external processes act on galaxies and may even transform late - type galaxies into early - type galaxies .",
    "this transformation depends on the environment and involves several mechanisms . for instance",
    ", ram - pressure stripping by the hot intracluster medium can deprive a galaxy of its gas @xcite , while harassment by galaxy - galaxy interactions transforms disks into more spheroidal objects @xcite . for an extensive review on these , and other , environmental effects",
    "see @xcite .",
    "observations of rotation in des , and the existence of des with residual disk structure , support the idea that some des are transformed late - type spiral or dwarf irregular galaxies @xcite .    given the importance of dwarf galaxies and the fact that we still do not know what mechanisms play the dominant role in their formation and evolution , the magpop eu research and training network embarked on an observational project to study the star formation history of dwarf galaxies .",
    "in the framework of an international time programme ( itp ) we used a variety of telescopes and instruments at the roque de los muchachos observatory in la palma to study the structure , dynamics and stellar populations in a large sample of dwarf galaxies ( ( see * ? ? ? * ) . in this paper",
    "we present the first results of this project , examining the ages , metallicities and abundance ratios of des and their relation to their stellar light distribution and environment , using intermediate - resolution optical spectra .    in the next section",
    "we describe the sample , the observations and the data reduction . in section  [ sec_results ] , we report the results from our analysis of the indices ( [ sec_indices ] ) , ages , metallicities and abundance ratios ( [ sec_agemetalfa ] ) , the stellar light distributions ( [ sec_lightdistribution ] ) and the virgocentric distance ( [ sec_virgodistance ] ) . we discuss the implications of our results on the formation and evolution scenarios for des in section  [ sec_discussion ] .",
    "finally we summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec_conclusions ] .",
