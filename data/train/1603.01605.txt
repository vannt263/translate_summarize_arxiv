    "nanobeam - microdisk samples as shown in fig .",
    "1 of the main text are fabricated according to the procedure outlined in fig .",
    "1 . the process begins with a series of low pressure chemical vapor deposition ( lpcvd ) steps on a 4 \" cz si wafer .",
    "400 nm of stoichiometric si@xmath0n@xmath1 ( sin ) is deposited at 800@xmath104c , followed by 100 nm of amorphous si ( a - si ) at 500@xmath104c ( to be used as a hard mask ) .",
    "the microdisk and nanobeam are patterned on top of the a - si film by electron beam lithography , in 100 nm of hsq .",
    "the pattern is transfered into the a - si film ( creating a hard mask for the subsequent sin etch ) using a hbr etch process .",
    "the pattern is then transfered into the sin film by reactive ion etching , using an spts aps dielectric etcher and chf@xmath0 chemistry .",
    "the process is concluded by undercutting the microdisk and nanobeam with koh , followed by critical point drying .",
    "the fabrication process was developed and optimized with two goals in mind : ( 1 ) to minimize the in - plane gap ( @xmath105 ) between the nanobeam and the microdisk and ( 2 ) to minimize the sidewall roughness of the microdisk .",
    "small @xmath105 is desirable as it gives rise to a large parametric ( optomechanical ) coupling @xmath106 between the lateral position of the beam and the frequency @xmath107 of the microdisk whispering gallery mode ( wgm ) @xcite . for beams with in - plane thickness much smaller than the operating wavelength @xmath63",
    ", it can be shown that @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the in - plane evanescent decay length of the wgm @xcite .",
    "thus a design gap of @xmath110 nm was chosen in conjunction with an operating wavelength of @xmath111 nm .",
    "low sidewall roughness is desirable in order to reduce the possibility of wgm loss ( @xmath112 ) due to rayleigh scattering from the disk s surface @xcite . collectively , increasing @xmath113 and reducing @xmath112 was crucial to achieving the high sensitivity displacement measurements shown in fig . 3 and employed in figs .",
    "4 - 5 of the main text . for example , in fig . 3 of the main text , the thermomechanical signal - to - noise ( in this case dominated by electronic detector noise ) is proportional to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is the optical input power @xcite .",
    "the requirements for etching optically smooth sidewalls separated by @xmath110 nm depends on the thickness of the sin film .",
    "we chose a @xmath116 nm - thick film as a compromise between achieving a large wgm evanescence and low wgm radiation loss . achieving a vertical @xmath110 nm gap",
    "thus required etching sin with an aspect ratio much better than 1:4 . we found that achieving this aspect ratio while maintaining an optically smooth surface was difficult with standard rie etching techniques ( employing standard e - beam resists ) , due to mask erosion .",
    "it is for this reason that a - si was employed as a secondary hard mask .",
    "a - si provides high selectivity ( @xmath1171:10 ) relative to sin in rie as well as high resistance to mask erosion .",
    "thus we have achieved gaps as small as @xmath118 nm and relatively smooth sidewalls , characterized by optical quality factors in excess of @xmath119 in the absence of a beam ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . for the results shown in figs . 3 - 5 of the main text",
    ", we employed elliptical microdisks with a fixed circumference of approximately @xmath120 m , an ellipticity ( major radius over minor radius ) ranging from 1 to 4 , and @xmath121 nm . typical intrinsic optical linewidths of @xmath122 ghz were observed .",
    "an estimate of @xmath123 mhz / nm is obtained by approximating the microdisk wgm profile with the analytical form of a microtoroid wgm , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the radiation loss model shown in fig .",
    "4 of the main text was obtained by computing the complex eigenfrequency spectrum of the mechanical structure surrounded by numerically implemented pml ( perfectly matched layer , corresponding to a perfectly impedance matched and aborbing boundary ) .",
    "we used the comsol structural mechanics finite element analysis software package for this simulation .",
    "the modeled structure is shown in gray in fig .",
    "2a , and includes the sin defect beam , sin pnc , sin support pads , the si pillars beneath each support pad , a half - spherical section of the si substrate .",
    "the blue shell in fig .",
    "2a corresponds to the pml . by placing the pml far from the nanobeam",
    ", we ensure that reflection of acoustic waves from the supports is accounted for in the simulation .",
    "we also ensure that the size of the pml is large enough that its own reflection coefficient is negligible @xcite .",
    "visualization of acoustic radiation into the pml is shown in fig .",
    "radiation loss manifests as an imaginary component of each numerically computed eigenfrequency , @xmath124 .",
    "the eigenfrequency of the defect mode is identified based on its mode shape .",
    "radiation - loss - limited @xmath2-factors ( blue curve in fig . 4 of the main text ) are obtained from the formula : @xmath125}{2\\cdot \\text{im}[\\omega_{\\mathrm{m}}]}.\\ ] ]    the location of the knee point in the model of @xmath51 versus @xmath3 in fig .",
    "4 of the main text depends on the dimensions of the extended mechanical structure , in particular that of si pillars and the trapezoidal end - points of the beam ( c.f .",
    "1a in the main text ) .",
    "the blue curve shown in fig .",
    "4 of the main text employs dimensions obtained from sem imaging and uses no fit parameters .",
    "the acoustic impedance of the pnc depends on the number of unit cells used .",
    "we employed a 7-cell pnc to obtain the results described in the main text .",
    "this choice was based on a model of @xmath51 versus number of cells .",

    "<S> string - like beam resonators possess conventionally 10 times smaller @xmath5 products ; however , on account of their much larger @xmath2-to - mass ratio and reduced mode density , they remain a canonical choice for precision force , mass , and charge sensing , and have recently enabled heisenberg - limited position measurements at cryogenic temperatures . here </S>",
    "<S> we explore two techniques to enhance the @xmath2-factor of a nanomechanical beam . </S>",
    "<S> the techniques relate to two main loss mechanisms : internal loss , which dominates for large aspect ratios and @xmath6 mhz , and radiation loss , which dominates for small aspect ratios and @xmath7 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> first we show that by embedding a nanobeam in a 1d phononic crystal , it is possible to localize its flexural motion and shield it against radiation loss . using this method , we realize @xmath8 mhz modes with @xmath9 , consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with unshielded beams of similar dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> we then study the @xmath5 products of high - order modes of mm - long nanobeams . </S>",
    "<S> taking advantage of the mode - shape dependence of stress - induced ` loss - dilution ' , we realize a @xmath10 mhz mode with @xmath11 hz . </S>",
    "<S> our results can extend room temperature quantum coherent operation to ultra - low - mass 1d nanomechanical oscillators .    </S>",
    "<S> silicon nitride ( sin ) nanomembranes and beams have emerged as striking exceptions to the empirical @xmath12 scaling of solid - state mechanical oscillators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> much of the recent history of this development can be traced to the ` discovery ' that a commercial tem slide made of 100 nm - thick lpcvd si@xmath0n@xmath1 , forming a membrane resonator , can realize a room temperature @xmath13 hz as well as ppm - level optical loss @xcite . the former constitutes a basic requirement for quantum - coherent evolution ( since in this case the oscillator s frequency @xmath3 is larger than its thermal decoherence rate , @xmath14 ) , while the latter enables integration into a high finesse optical cavity , allowing for quantum - limited displacement readout and actuation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> encouraged by these prospects , considerable effort has been made to understand the source of high @xmath2 in sin films . </S>",
    "<S> it is now generally accepted to be the large ( @xmath15 gpa ) tensile stress resulting from lpcvd , which increases the elastic energy stored in the film without changing the material loss tangent @xcite ( a concept in fact dating back to mirror pendulum supports in gravitational wave interferometers @xcite ) . exploiting this insight , radio frequency membranes with room temperature @xmath16 </S>",

    "<S> the major challenge associated with nanobeams is their small form factor , which makes it difficult to transduce their motion . towards this end , we employ a microcavity - based near - field sensor @xcite capable of non - invasive thermal noise measurements with @xmath17 resolution . our first strategy is to pattern short ( @xmath18 m ) , very - high - frequency ( @xmath19 mhz ) nanobeams @xcite , for which an important source of loss is acoustic radiation . to address this challenge </S>",
    "<S> , we pattern the nanobeam as a defect in a 1d phononic crystal ( pnc ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the frequency of a beam mode coincides with a band - gap of the pnc , the latter acts as an acoustic shield , effectively localizing flexural motion and suppressing radiation loss @xcite . using this strategy </S>",
    "<S> , we realize localized flexural modes with effective mass @xmath20 pg , @xmath8 mhz and @xmath21 , consistent with internal loss and contrasting sharply with unshielded beams of similar dimensions . our second strategy is to study the high order modes of mm - long nanobeams , which exhibit enhanced @xmath5 due to tensile stress . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that by appropriate choice of beam length and mode order , it is possible to realize @xmath22 , @xmath23 mhz modes with a ` quantum - enabled ' @xmath24 hz , a regime previously accessed only by @xmath25 ng membrane resonators @xcite .    </S>",
