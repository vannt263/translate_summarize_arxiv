    "most baryons in clusters reside in the hot icm , and most clusters are low - mass groups and poor clusters because the mass function of virialized systems is steep .",
    "studies of galaxy groups are thus especially important for understanding the gravitational and thermal evolution of the bulk of matter in the universe . in contrast to hot clusters , galaxy groups are systems where baryon physics ( e.g. , cooling , galactic winds and agn feedback ) begins to dominate over gravity .",
    "groups are not just scaled - down version of massive clusters .",
    "cluster scaling relations ( e.g. , @xmath15 and entropy - @xmath16 ) show deviations from the self - similar relations at the low - mass end ( reviewed in voit 2005 ) , reflecting the importance of baryon physics , which is essential to shape the properties of the cluster galaxies and icm .",
    "cooling sets a characteristic entropy threshold in the icm ( voit & ponman 2003 ) and is required to understand the cluster scaling relations ( voit 2005 ) . on the other hand , cooling has to be balanced by feedback to preserve the observed cluster stellar fraction and the galaxy luminosity function",
    ". the most important feedback may be the agn outflows driven by the central smbh .",
    "agn outflows can simultaneously explain the antihierarchical quenching of star formation in massive galaxies , the exponential cut - off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function , and the quenching of cooling - flows in cluster cores ( e.g. , scannapieco et al . 2005 ; croton et al .",
    "along with sn winds , they act to suppress cooling and structure formation .",
    "they pump thermal energy into the surrounding icm as the host galaxy and the central smbh formed and evolve .",
    "these imprints are recorded in the icm and are reflected in the cluster scaling relations .",
    "there are two important icm properties that directly reflect the role of baryon physics .",
    "the first is icm entropy . with  and  data , ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that at 0.1 @xmath17 , the icm entropy ( @xmath18 ) obeys a simple relation with the cluster temperature ( @xmath16 ) , @xmath19 , which is different from the self - similar relation ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and voit & ponman ( 2003 ) demonstrated that this @xmath8 relation at 0.1 @xmath17 can be understood with a simple model involving a fixed cooling threshold , which may be related to galaxy formation",
    ". however , the details of cooling and feedback that determine this threshold and its scatter are still unclear .",
    "finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) showed that groups and clusters have significant excess entropy at @xmath5 .",
    "voit & ponman ( 2003 ) suggested that smooth accretion ( via e.g. , galactic winds in subhalos ) can boost entropy higher than lumpy hierarchical accretion to produce the observed excess .",
    "however , borgani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) show that galactic winds alone are not able to boost entropy very much at radii beyond @xmath5 .",
    "the agn - like feedback algorithm in kay ( 2004 ) has a more substantial effect on entropy at large radii , which may imply that radio outflows have an important impact on group properties .",
    "thus , it is important to robustly constrain the entropy around @xmath5 with observations and to connect the dispersion with other group properties .",
    "the ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) results rely on extrapolations based on assumed density ( @xmath21-model ) and temperature ( polytropic - model ) profiles , which may not be adequate and may bias the derived icm properties ( e.g. , borgani et al .",
    "2004 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 , v06 hereafter ) .",
    "these early results can be examined with and .",
    "there has been some work on the icm entropy of groups with the or  data ( e.g. , mushotzky et al .",
    "2003 ; sun et al . 2003",
    "; pratt et al . 2005 , 2006 ; mahdavi et al .",
    "2005 ; finoguenov et al . 2007 ) .",
    "our much larger sample allows us to study the scatter in group properties . as the icm properties",
    "are traced to at least @xmath4 for each group , the @xmath8 relation at @xmath22 can be better constrained from our studies .",
    "another important icm property is the gas fraction .",
    "groups have low gas fractions within @xmath4 ( 0.03 - 0.07 , v06 ; gastaldello et al .",
    "2007 , g07 hereafter ) .",
    "however , few groups have gas fraction measured to @xmath5 .",
    "v06 and g07 derived gas fraction within @xmath5 for four low - temperature systems ( @xmath23 2.7 kev ) .",
    "the results , 0.06 - 0.15 , span a large range .",
    "gas fraction in simulated groups and clusters is directly related to the strength of cooling and star formation ( e.g. , kravtsov et al . 2005 ) , and a small gas fraction in groups may imply efficient cooling and star formation . the enclosed gas fraction can also be modified by the agn feedback ( e.g. , puchwein et al . 2008 ) , thus bearing the imprint of the feedback history .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to know how gas fractions and total baryon fractions ( gas + stars ) of groups at @xmath5 compare with those of clusters .",
    "the @xmath24 relation is also important for cosmology , e.g. , determining cosmological parameters , and using the sunyaev - zeldovich flux as a proxy for the cluster mass ( e.g. , vikhlinin et al .",
    "2008 , v08 hereafter ) .",
    "besides the science related to entropy and gas fraction , better determination of the group gas properties are also essential to constraining the low - mass ends of other important scaling relations ( e.g. , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) . @xmath27 and @xmath28 relations are essential for using clusters to study cosmology ( e.g. , kravtsov et al . 2006 ; v08 ) , while the @xmath26 relation is important for understanding the formation and evolution of the dark matter halos ( e.g. , buote et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we started a systematic analysis of galaxy groups in the  archive to better constrain the icm properties in groups and to better understand the difference between groups and clusters .",
    "in this paper , we present the results on 43 galaxy groups that appear relaxed beyond the central core .",
    "our sample is larger than in the previous work on 3 - 16 groups with   and  data ( mahdavi et al .",
    "2005 ; pratt et al . 2005 ; finoguenov et al . 2007 ; g07 ; rasmussen & ponman 2007 ) . the data are homogeneously analyzed with results on temperature , entropy , gas mass and total mass .",
    "the sample size also allows us to measure the scatter in various interesting icm properties .",

    "the data analysis is presented in @xmath293 , including spatial and spectral analysis .",
    "we especially discuss the  background and our method of background subtraction in this section and appendix . in @xmath294 , we define four tiers of groups with different data coverage",
    ". different characteristic radii ( @xmath4 , @xmath9 , @xmath6 and @xmath5 ) are reached in different tiers .",
    "we also define the system temperatures in @xmath294 ( @xmath30 etc . ) and derive their empirical relations .",
    "the group temperature profiles are discussed in @xmath295 , while @xmath296 is about the icm entropy . in @xmath297 , we discuss @xmath27 and @xmath28 relations , gas fraction , concentration parameter , baryon fraction and fossil groups in this sample",
    ". there are groups with signs of agn heating and groups with strong central radio sources in this sample .",
    "we discuss them in @xmath298 .",
    "systematic errors are discussed in @xmath299 .",
    "@xmath2910 is the summary and conclusions .",
    "we assumed h@xmath31 = 73 km s@xmath14 mpc@xmath14 , @xmath32@xmath33=0.24 , and @xmath34=0.76 .",
    "the groups in the sample are mainly selected from the  archive as of september , 2008 .",
    "we also include proprietary data on three groups from the  program 09800349 ( pi : vikhlinin ) .",
    "we started to collect groups from several previous group samples constructed from  observations : mahdavi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , mulchaey et al . ( 2003 ) and gems ( osmond , & ponman 2004 ) .",
    "we have also searched for low temperature systems ( @xmath35 kev ) in the on - line database bax",
    ". however , most  groups with well - determined temperatures are quite nearby .",
    "the most distant group in gems is at @xmath36=0.0282 ( ngc  6338 ) . as we want to constrain gas properties out to at least @xmath4 ( ideally @xmath5 ) for each system , many nearby systems in these catalogs are excluded .",
    "thus , we have had to extensively examine the data in the  archive seeking groups with good observations out to these large radii .",
    "our selection criteria are : 1 ) full - frame advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) data at the focal plane temperature of -120c ( after jan .",
    "29 , 2000 ) ; 2 ) @xmath37 kev and a global temperature constrained to better than 15% ; 3 ) 0.015 @xmath3 0.13 and group emission traced to at least @xmath4 with the  data ; 4 ) group emission well centered around the cd and not significantly elongated or disturbed beyond the group core .",
    "@xmath30 is the temperature measured between 0.15 @xmath5 and @xmath5 ( defined and discussed in @xmath294 ) .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath30 is determined from the @xmath11 relation in v06 to make sure that we are studying low - mass systems with @xmath38 of @xmath39 m@xmath2 .",
    "we understand that there is not a well - defined temperature boundary separating galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "many people may consider groups to be systems with temperatures of @xmath40 2 kev .",
    "nevertheless , we refer to all the systems in our sample as groups for convenient comparison with the clusters in v08 .",
    "the requirement to well constrain @xmath30 allows us to derive a temperature profile for each group .",
    "the constraint on redshift enables a first cut to make sure @xmath4 can be reached .",
    "we used the @xmath41 relation in v06 as the first guess .",
    "it turns out the derived @xmath41 relations from our work are close to v06 s . with the @xmath42 relation in v06 , @xmath4 = 11.6@xmath43 for an 1 kev group at @xmath44 .",
    "an acis pointing can reach this radius although the coverage is partial . the only exception to the redshift requirement is ngc  1550 at @xmath45 .",
    "there are two offset observations for this luminous group that allow us to reach @xmath6 .",
    "clearly some hotter systems at @xmath46 may not meet our criterion to reach @xmath4 and are excluded after their temperatures are constrained .",
    "we indeed have examined many more systems than the ones in our final sample . with s superior angular resolution ,",
    "almost all groups have substructures around the center , and in some cases these features can be very significant and striking , like the central 60 kpc of ic  1262 ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "nevertheless , they are included as long as the group emission is well centered and regular at @xmath48 , where our main interests are .",
    "our science goals concerning gas entropy are also not affected by the dynamic state of the group . moreover , at least the @xmath49 mass proxy is still robust in unrelaxed systems ( kravtsov et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the  archival search not only includes targets in the cluster and galaxy categories , but also targets in the agn category , as many radio galaxies are in group environments .",
    "there are also targets selected optically .",
    "many faint systems are included , as shown by the wide range of gas entropy at 30 kpc and 0.15 @xmath5 ( @xmath296 ) .",
    "thus , our final sample is not much biased to the x - ray luminous systems .",
    "the final sample includes 43 groups , listed in table 1 .",
    "it is hardly a homogeneous or a complete sample .",
    "but the wide spread of the gas densities and entropy values at @xmath50 indicates a wide luminosity range as cool cores in groups contribute a large portion of their luminosities ( see @xmath297.2 ) .",
    "if there were groups that are much fainter or poorer in gas than the faint systems in this sample , it is difficult to constrain their gas properties with the current x - ray instruments anyway . because of the layout of acis , full coverage at large radii ( defined as @xmath7 80% coverage for the outermost spectral extraction bin , as there is always area missing from extended and point sources and chip gaps )",
    "is only achieved in 7 groups ( table 2 ) .",
    "however , the coverage at @xmath51 is much better .",
    "previous analysis for nearby clusters or groups with the  data all had partial coverage at large radii ( e.g. , v06 ; rasmussen et al . 2007 ; v08 ) and our sample is about 3 times bigger than these previous ones .",
    "all observations were performed with acis .",
    "standard data analysis was performed which includes the corrections for the slow gain change and charge transfer inefficiency ( for both the fi and bi chips ) .",
    "we investigated the light curve of source - free regions ( or regions with a small fraction of the source emission ) to identify and exclude time intervals with particle background flares , including weak flares .",
    "the relevant information on the  pointings is listed in table 1 .",
    "we corrected for the acis low energy quantum efficiency ( qe ) degradation due to the contamination on acis s optical blocking filter , which increases with time and is positionally dependent .",
    "the dead area effect on the fi chips , caused by cosmic rays , has also been corrected .",
    "as the background subtraction is important for this project , we present it in detail in the next section and appendix .",
    "we do not use any data on the s4 chip , because of the residual streaks often seen at low levels ( after running the ciao tool `` destreak '' ) and the lack of the stowed background data . the `` readout artifact '' , seen in groups with very bright cores ,",
    "is also corrected ( see e.g. , v06 ) .",
    "we used ciao3.4 for the data analysis .",
    "the calibration files used correspond to  calibration database ( caldb ) 3.4.3 from the  x - ray center , released in march , 2008 .",
    "we are aware of a possible over - correction of the  effective area beyond the iridium m - edge ( @xmath10 2 kev ) in caldb 3.4.3 and before ( see david s presentation in the 2007  calibration workshop ) , which can bias  temperatures to higher values , especially for hot clusters ( @xmath52 kev ) . the difference between  and  temperatures is also shown in snowden et al .",
    "the calibration work to incorporate this into the  caldb is ongoing .",
    "however , as shown in both david s presentation and snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , the agreement between  and  temperatures for @xmath53 4 - 5 kev systems is very good .",
    "the highest gas temperature at any radii in our sample is @xmath10 3.3 kev for several groups at the center , while temperatures at large radii are much lower and mainly determined by the iron l hump ( instead of the continuum slope as for hot clusters ) .",
    "thus , any changes in our results from this correction should be smaller than the current measurement errors and scatter . in the spectral analysis , a lower energy cut of 0.4 kev ( for the bi data ) and 0.5 kev ( for the fi data )",
    "is used to minimize the effects of calibration uncertainties at low energy .",
    "the solar photospheric abundance table by anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) is used in the spectral fits .",
    "uncertainties quoted in this paper are 1 @xmath54 .      proper background subtraction is important for the analysis in the low surface brightness regions of the groups . a detailed discussion of the  background and the relevant dataset is presented in the appendix .",
    "we determine the local background based on the stowed background data and modeling .",
    "the corresponding stowed background of each observation is scaled according to the flux ratio in the 9.5 - 12 kev band ( e.g. , v05 ) .",
    "we adopt a 3% uncertainty on the particle background ( pb ) normalization ( 5% for bi data in period e , see appendix ) in the error budgets .",
    "the local cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) can be modeled .",
    "the best fit of the hard cxb component is determined with an absorbed power law with a photon index of 1.5 .",
    "the absorption is determined from spectral fits to the group spectra , which involves iterations and is present in @xmath293.3 .",
    "the soft cxb component is adequately described by two thermal components at zero redshift , one unabsorbed component with a fixed temperature of 0.1 kev and another absorbed component with a temperature either derived from spectral fits or fixed at 0.25 kev ( see appendix ) .",
    "abundances of both components are fixed at solar .",
    "we can compare our cxb model with other work .",
    "v05 used the blank sky background and corrected for differences between a local control field and the blank sky background .",
    "as the scaling factors of the pb are close to unity in their sample , v05 ignored the correction for the unresolved hard cxb .",
    "however , the correction for hard cxb becomes more important after the middle of 2004 when the pb flux is 30% - 50% higher than that in the blank sky background ( appendix ) .",
    "v05 found that generally a single thermal component with a temperature of @xmath10 0.2 kev and solar abundance can fit the soft cxb excess or decrement well . in regions with high rass r45 values , a second thermal component with a temperature of @xmath10 0.4 kev and solar abundance is required .",
    "humphrey & buote ( 2006 ) and g07 also used two thermal components with solar abundances to describe the soft cxb .",
    "the cxb temperatures are fixed at 0.07 kev and 0.2 kev . as discussed in the appendix , snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) used three thermal components to describe the soft cxb .",
    "thus , our model of the soft cxb only has less freedom than the model by snowden et al .",
    "however , our model balances the requirement of having enough components to fit the local cxb and avoiding parameter degeneracy in generally low - statistics data .",
    "first , the two @xmath10 0.1 kev components will naturally be mixed in our energy band when the absorption is low .",
    "second , statistics for most of our groups at large radii are not very good , so uncertainties are mainly statistical errors . as long as the background uncertainties are folded into the final error budgets , very detailed modeling of the soft cxb component",
    "is not crucial .",
    "third , we test different models of the soft cxb for groups in our sample for which a large group - emission - free region is available .",
    "all spectra can be well fit by our two - component model , while the three - component model by snowden et al .",
    "( 2008 ) makes little or no improvement . in fact",
    ", the soft cxb can be well fitted by a single thermal component in most cases .",
    "however , the abundance usually has to be free and the best - fit value is usually very close to zero .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the two - component soft cxb model is adequate and also necessary for our analysis .    the  observations in our sample can be classified into two categories , one with regions free of group emission in the fov , another with group emission detected to the edge of the field .",
    "cool systems at higher redshifts ( e.g. , @xmath55 ) usually have group - emission - free regions in the off - center chips ( e.g. , s2 for acis - i observations , i2/3 and s1 for acis - s observations ) .",
    "there are also two groups with adjacent  pointings for unrelated targets in coincidence ( eso  306 - 017 and a1692 ) .",
    "we took the following approach to look for group - emission - free regions .",
    "the radial surface brightness profile is derived with the exposure correction and background subtraction using the scaled stowed background .",
    "different pointings for the same group are combined .",
    "the obtained surface brightness profile has group emission plus the cxb .",
    "the region where cxb is more dominant than the group emission , if present , can be determined from the flattened portion at the outer region of the surface brightness profile .",
    "we used a power law plus a constant at large radii to determine whether a significant group - emission - free region exists and the radial range of that region .",
    "if such a region is found , we have a control field with only cxb . in this work ,",
    "the inner radius of the group - emission - free region is @xmath56 larger than the outermost radius for the group temperature profile .",
    "this control field may be a single region on the s2 chip ( for the acis - i data ) or two separate regions on the s1 and i2/i3 chips respectively ( for the acis - s data ) .",
    "although we could simply fit the spectrum ( or spectra ) of this control field to determine the local cxb , the statistics are generally not sufficient .",
    "moreover , the hard cxb in this control field may be larger than that in the outermost bin for the group temperature profile , as the flux of the hard cxb depends on point source excision .",
    "thus , we fit the spectra of the control field and the outermost bin for the group temperature profile together to better constrain the local cxb .",
    "the normalizations of the soft cxb in different regions are linked by the ratios of their covered solid angles of the sky , while the normalizations of the hard cxb are not linked .",
    "therefore , we can determine the local cxb in the outermost bin for the group temperature profile . in this work",
    ", we assume that the soft cxb is constant across the examined group area .",
    "accurate determination of the local cxb is only important for large radii .",
    "the covered area at large radii tends to be in the same direction from the group center so the assumption should be reasonable .",
    "there is a complication that the hard cxb may be smaller in inner radial bins but it is a small effect and can be corrected ( also discussed later in this section ) .",
    "however , many groups in our sample have group emission detected to the edge of the field , so we have to fit the cxb components with the group emission together . since these groups are limited by the  fov , the group emission is generally still significant near the edge of the field .",
    "we fit the spectra from the two outermost radial bins together , with the normalizations of the soft cxb components linked . generally in this work ,",
    "we are conservative and do not include the outermost bin in the temperature profile as the uncertainties are generally large .",
    "however , there are a few groups that remain bright to the edge of the field ( e.g. , ngc  1550 , a262 and mkw4 )",
    ". they all have s1 data , so the soft cxb component can be easily separated from the group emission ( e.g. , fig .",
    "1 ) , owing to the good response of the bi chips at @xmath40 1 kev . as the temperatures of the cool gas can be well constrained from the iron hump centroid , group emission can be robustly separated from the soft cxb even to the edge of the field .",
    "thus , we derive temperature profiles to the edge of the field for these groups .    as we separate the pb from the cxb , the absolute cxb flux can be derived in each group field . in table 2",
    ", we list the flux of the local background components , for both the soft cxb and the hard unresolved cxb ( in the outermost bin ) .",
    "we expect the derived soft cxb is on average correlated with the rass r45 flux in the surrounding area ( excluding the source region , see table 2 ) , which is true as shown in fig .",
    "2 . one should be aware of the uncertainty in the r45 flux , as the rass soft x - ray background maps have 0.2 deg pixels and the various uncertainties combined are not small ( e.g. , variable swcx emission ) .",
    "there are also uncertainties related to cross - calibration and cosmic variance of both the soft and hard cxb , so a detailed one - to - one comparison is hardly meaningful .",
    "the derived 2- 8 kev flux of the hard cxb component depends on the limiting flux of the observation .",
    "as discussed in appendix , there is an empirical relation between the limiting flux for point sources and the average 2 - 8 kev flux of unresolved hard cxb ( k07 ) .",
    "we estimated the average limiting flux of the group observations in the outermost spectral bin .",
    "the regions we used to control the local background generally have an area of about one acis chip . as shown in hickox & markevitch 2006 ( hm06 hereafter ) and k07 , the cosmic variance in this angular scale ( depending on the two - point angular correlation function of point sources )",
    "is 20% - 30% and the total hard cxb flux has @xmath10 10% uncertainty .",
    "thus , the expected hard cxb flux from the empirical relation is only meaningful in an average sense .",
    "we use the ciao tool mkpsf to generate several psfs ( at an energy of 1.4 kev ) in the outermost spectral bin .",
    "we then derive the 90% enclosed power aperture and measure the 3@xmath54 limits at these regions .",
    "their average is taken as the estimate for the limiting flux for point sources .",
    "compared with the average growth curve determined by k07 ( their fig .",
    "19 ) , we have an estimate of the unresolved hard cxb , which is also listed in table 2 .",
    "we can see from table 2 that the general agreement is quite good , while the uncertainties for the hard x - ray cxb are much larger than the difference .",
    "it is also true that the limiting flux for point sources depends on the off - axis angle .",
    "the  limiting flux changes little within the central 6 - 7@xmath43 from the aimpoint , but increases rapidly beyond 10@xmath43 . this can be corrected from the slope of limiting flux vs. unresolved hard cxb in k07 and the absolute flux in the outermost bin .",
    "the correction is small , also because the errors of the hard cxb are not small .    besides the 3% uncertainty on the pb mentioned above ( 5% for bi data in period e )",
    ", we also included the following error budgets and added them ( and the pb uncertainty ) to the statistical uncertainties of temperatures , abundances and surface brightness in quadrature . for the hard cxb",
    ", we set the photon index at 1.1 and 1.9 ( e.g. , hm06 ) and repeat the analysis to estimate the local background in those situations .",
    "for the soft cxb component , if the temperature of the hotter component can not be derived from the data and is fixed at 0.25 kev , we change it to 0.2 kev and 0.3 kev and repeat the analysis to estimate the local background in those situations .",
    "thus , we are conservative in the uncertainties for the local cxb .      once the local cxb is determined , we proceed to derive the projected temperature profile .",
    "the radial bins for temperature measurement are decided from the outermost bin , by requiring the temperature to be constrained to better than 30% ( 1 @xmath54 with all error budgets ) and @xmath57 = 1.3 - 1.75 . after determining the outermost bin ,",
    "the inner bins are determined progressively with @xmath57 = 1.25 - 1.6 .",
    "point sources and sub - clumps are excluded .",
    "the absorption column is determined from the mekal fit to the integrated spectrum between @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in this process",
    ", we also tried the vmekal model with extra free parameters of o , ne , mg , si , s , fe and ni abundances , as a lower o / fe ratio may cause excess absorption ( buote et al .",
    "this process and the determination of the local cxb are done in iterations to obtain the final value of the absorption .",
    "if the derived absorption is consistent with the galactic absorption from the hi survey ( table 2 ) within 1 @xmath54 , the galactic value is used .",
    "only when both mekal and vmekal fits show excess absorption , the x - ray absorption from the mekal fit ( always consistent with the vmekal fit within 1 @xmath54 ) is adopted ( table 2 ) .",
    "about 44% of groups show excess absorption relative to the galactic value and indeed we find  100 @xmath60 m enhancement in many of these groups ( see appendix for discussions of some groups ) .",
    "we also examined the absorption variation with radius in each group . beyond the central 20 kpc ,",
    "no significant absorption variation is found for any group so we used a fixed absorption column for each group . in several cases , we observed an absorption increase within the central 20 kpc , but this analysis is complicated by the possible multi - phase gas around the center .",
    "nevertheless , it has little effect on any of our results .",
    "we also discuss the systematic error related to absorption in @xmath299 .",
    "we used the mekal model to fit the spectra of the group emission .",
    "the free parameters are temperature , abundance and normalization , once the absorption is determined . for spectra around the center , we also include a component to account for the lmxb emission from the cd galaxy .",
    "the lmxb component is represented by a power law with an index of 1.7 , within @xmath61 aperture obtained from hyperleda .",
    "the total lmxb luminosity is fixed from the @xmath62 relation derived in kim & fabbiano ( 2004 ) , where @xmath63 is the total @xmath64 band luminosity of the cd from 2mass .",
    "we also assume that the lmxb emission follows the @xmath64 band light ( see also gilfanov 2004 ) .",
    "the projected group temperature profiles are shown in fig .",
    "we used the algorithm determined by vikhlinin ( 2006 ) to derive the deprojected temperature profiles in a parametric way , which was first applied in v06 .",
    "the required inputs are the three - dimensional ( 3d ) or deprojected profiles of gas density and abundance , and the projected temperature profile .",
    "v06 simply used the projected abundance profile as their sample is dominated by hot clusters .",
    "however , the emissivity of @xmath53 2 kev plasma is sensitive to the chemical abundances so the 3d abundance profile is required for our work .",
    "we applied the non - parametric geometrical deprojection ( summarized in e.g. , pizzolato et al .",
    "2003 ; g07 ) to derive deprojected abundances in wider radial bins , generally merging 2 - 3 adjacent bins for the temperature profile .",
    "the deprojected abundance is an emission - weighted average in each bin so an effective radius in each bin is required .",
    "we define the effective radius as the emissivity - weighted radius in each bin , where the plasma emissivity , @xmath65 , depends on the 3d profiles of temperature , abundance and density .",
    "since the determination of the 3d profiles of temperature , abundance and density depends on each other , iterations have to be done to derive the best - fit 3d profiles . usually at most three iterations",
    "are required to stabilize the best - fits of these profiles .",
    "we assumed the following 3d abundance profile :    @xmath66    this simple form can fit the abundance profiles of all groups in the sample .",
    "an example is shown in fig . 6 that represents the best - constrained 3d abundance profile in this sample ( thus the most difficult to fit , as the errors are the smallest ) .",
    "most groups in this sample only have 3d abundances constrained in 3 - 5 bins with larger errors so good fits can always be achieved with this simple function .",
    "once the best - fits of all profiles are achieved , we applied 1000 monte carlo simulations to address the uncertainties of the 3d abundance profile . the simulation is realized by scattering the 3d abundance profile according to the measurement errors .",
    "in this process , to be conservative , we also include an uncertainty of 10% of the bin size on the effective radius of each bin for the abundance profile .",
    "thus , besides the best - fit 3d abundance profile , we have 1000 simulated profiles to cover the error ranges , which will be used to estimate the uncertainties of the 3d temperature and density profiles .",
    "we used the same form of the 3d temperature profile as used in v06 :    @xmath67^{c / b}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the exceptions are a1139 , a1238 and a2092 , which are faintest 2 - 3 kev systems in this sample so the errors on temperatures are large .",
    "their 3d temperature profiles are modeled as : @xmath68^{b / a}$ ] , which fits their temperature profiles very well ( fig . 4 and 5 ) .",
    "the inner boundary of the fit is 5 - 20 kpc , depending on the quality of the fits at the center .",
    "as we focus on properties at large radii , the detailed choice of the inner boundary ( 5 - 20 kpc ) is not a concern . because the sizes of bins at large radii are not small , each bin",
    "is further divided into 6 sub bins .",
    "the temperature modeling is done at the center of each sub bin , only added up ( with the algorithm by vikhlinin 2006 ) at the end to obtain the expected temperature for each original bin of spectral analysis . in this way , the binsize effect is minimized and we do nt need to worry about the accurate determination of effective radius for each radial bin , as most previous work had to address . the uncertainty of the 3d temperature profile is derived from 1000 monte carlo simulations . in each simulation , the measured projected temperature profile is scattered according to the measurement errors , and a new simulated abundance profile is input .",
    "the density profile is fixed at the best - fit value , as the temperature error is the dominant error source .",
    "the reconstructed 3d temperature profiles , with 1 @xmath54 uncertainties from simulations , are also shown in fig .",
    "there are groups where a central corona exists ( e.g. , sun et al . 2007 ) , so naturally the temperature gradient at 5 - 20 kpc is large in these cases ( e.g. , a2462 , a160 , eso  306 - 107 , hcg  51 and ngc  6269 ) .",
    "sometimes the 3d temperature appears too low within 5 - 10 kpc radius ( e.g. , a160 and ngc  6269 ) , which however affects none of our results in this work as core properties are excluded .",
    "we extract the surface brightness profile in the 0.7 - 2 kev band , as suggested by v06 to avoid the 0.6 kev hump in the soft cxb .",
    "point sources and chip gaps are excluded .",
    "the scaled stowed background is subtracted so only the group emission and the local cxb is left .",
    "some previous analysis on a surface brightness profile involved the correction of a single exposure map .",
    "however , the  exposure map is energy and position dependent .",
    "it is not accurate to use a single exposure map ( even one convolved with the group spectrum ) as there is spectral variation in a group .",
    "the most accurate approach is to generate response files for each bin of the surface brightness and convert the raw count rate ( without corrections on vignetting and other response ) to density , from the derived 3d temperature and abundance profiles and response files . to achieve that",
    ", we use xspec to generate an mekal emissivity matrix that depends on temperature , abundance and position of the radial bin for surface brightness ( or response files there ) , once the absorption is determined .",
    "the ranges for temperatures and abundances cover the observed ranges for any particular group .",
    "this emissivity matrix provides the conversion factor needed to transfer the observed count rate to the emission measure .",
    "we assume the following density model ( with 11 free parameters ) :    @xmath69^{3\\beta-\\alpha/2 } } \\frac{1}{[1+(r / r_{s})^{\\gamma}]^{\\delta/\\gamma } } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "we find that this model provides very good fits for all groups in our sample .",
    "the density profile is then converted to the emissivity profile from the emissivity matrix .",
    "the emissivity profile is then projected along line of sight with the formula of geometrical deprojection ( e.g. , mclaughlin 1999 ) .",
    "the local cxb can be added later with the known cxb spectra and the radial set of the response files .",
    "the resulting surface brightness profile can be compared with the observed one . to avoid the binsize effect that may especially affect outskirts as wider bins are required there",
    ", we further divide bins within 100 kpc to 3 sub bins and bins beyond the central 100 kpc to 6 sub bins .",
    "the conversion and deprojection is done in these sub bins .",
    "they are later merged to compare with the observed profile .",
    "the density errors are estimated from 1000 monte carlo simulations , with 1000 corresponding simulated abundance and temperature profiles as inputs .",
    "this method is similar to that used in v06 , but we use the 3d temperature and abundance profiles to convert count rates to density . like v06",
    ", we also analyzed the  pspc pointed observations for the purpose of constraining gas density profiles at large radii .",
    "the inclusion of the pspc data is especially useful to @xmath70 groups .",
    "we used the software developed by snowden et al .",
    "( 1994 ) to produce flat - fielded pspc images in the 0.7 - 2 kev band ( more exactly , r567 bands , or pi channels of 70 - 201 ) .",
    "the images are further analyzed as described in vikhlinin et al .",
    "seventeen groups have sufficiently long pspc data ( listed in table 1 with effective exposure ) and we included the pspc surface brightness profile in the modeling of the density profile .",
    "the probed outermost radius of the pspc data for each group is listed in table 2 .",
    "we only used the pspc surface brightness profiles outside the central 3@xmath43 to avoid the psf correction in the core . in all cases ,",
    "there is good agreement between the  and pspc surface brightness data .",
    "one example is shown in fig",
    "as stated above , we generated 1000 simulated profiles of the 3d temperature , abundance and density profiles , which cover the ranges of the measurement errors . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , each set of the 3d temperature and density profiles determine a set of characteristic radii of the group ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath4 ) .",
    "the profiles of interesting quantities , e.g. , total mass , gas mass and entropy , and their values at the characteristic radii are also determined . for each quantity ,",
    "the peak in the distribution from 1000 simulations defines the most probable value ( or `` best fit '' ) .",

    "group properties at @xmath9 are also derived from extrapolation in this tier .",
    "previous x - ray work on clusters and groups often defined @xmath76 , which is the emission - weighted temperature within a certain aperture .",
    "as definitions are generally different , it is necessary to use an unified definition that is easily accessible from observations . in this work ,",
    "we define the system temperature as :    * @xmath30 : the spectroscopic temperature measured from the integrated spectrum in the projected 0.15 @xmath5 - @xmath5 annulus .",

    "the choice of the outer radius in the 3d integration little affects @xmath30 as it is emission - weighted .",
    "the same definition of the system temperature was also used in nagai , kravtsov & vikhlinin ( 2007b , nkv07 hereafter ) , maughan ( 2007 ) and v08 .",
    "this definition excludes the central region , where a cool core or a locally heated region may exist .",
    "indeed the group temperature profiles are much more similar at @xmath78 ( @xmath295 and fig .",
    "this temperature can also be directly derived from data , provided that the full coverage of @xmath5 is achieved ( generally not the case for groups in our sample ) .",

    "their empirical relations can also be determined .",
    "as we can not derive @xmath5 for groups in tiers 3 and 4 , the @xmath82 relation needs to be determined .",

    "no correlation is found , before or after the temperature dependence of entropy is removed .",
    "however in @xmath297.2 , we show that the entropy scatter at 0.15 @xmath5 is tightly correlated with the scatter of the gas fraction within @xmath4 .    despite large entropy scatter from the core to at least 0.15 @xmath5 , the @xmath8 relations are tighter at @xmath4 and beyond .",
    "we derived the intrinsic scatter in these relations , using the method described in pratt et al .",

    ". 11 , the intrinsic scatter reduces to 10% at @xmath4 and stays at that level to @xmath5 . as the derived intrinsic scatter decreases with increasing measurement errors , could this trend be due to the increasing measurement errors with radius ? to answer this question , we compared @xmath115 and @xmath116 relations .",
    "if we use the relative measurement errors of @xmath117 for the corresponding @xmath118 , the intrinsic scatter only increases to 12% .",
    "similarly , if we use the relative measurement errors of @xmath118 for the corresponding @xmath117 , the intrinsic scatter only decreases to 28% .",
    "therefore , the significant tightening of the @xmath8 relation from 0.15 @xmath5 to @xmath4 is not caused by different measurement errors .",
    "similarly , we find that the intrinsic scatter in entropy at radii from @xmath4 to @xmath6 is affected little by switching measurement errors .",

    "the tightening of the @xmath8 relation at @xmath4 and beyond was also reported in the nkv07 simulations , but the predicted @xmath120 relation by nkv07 lies below all groups in our sample ( fig . 11 and 12 ) . the nkv07 simulations with cooling + star - formation",

    "the resulting stellar fraction is about twice the observed value as too much material has cooled . if the star formation is suppressed with more efficient feedback , entropy is lower in the nkv07 simulations , between the results from the simulations with cooling + star - formation and the non - radiative simulations , which further disagrees with observations .",
    "it seems that the most challenging task is to explain the excess entropy of groups at @xmath4 . as shown in borgani & viel ( 2008 ) , simply increasing entropy floor from pre - heating produces too large voids in the lyman-@xmath121 forest .",
    "thus , it is still an open question on how to generate enough entropy in groups from the center to @xmath5 and still preserve other relations like the condensed baryon fraction and properties of the lyman-@xmath121 forest .",
    "we derived the ratios of the observed entropy to the baseline entropy from vkb05 at @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath4 ( fig .",
    "for comparison , we also include the entropy ratios for 14 clusters from v06 and v08 .",
    "the entropy ratios are always larger than or comparable to unity at all radii . the average ratio decreases with radius , for both groups and clusters , although the decrease is more rapid in groups . for groups ,",
    "the weighted mean decreases from 2.2 at @xmath4 to 1.57 - 1.60 at @xmath5 , while the mean decreases only @xmath10 9% for clusters .",

    "the weighted mean entropy of groups at @xmath5 is @xmath10 18% larger than that of clusters . if we consider only the @xmath122 kev groups , the weighted mean for 7 groups is 1.68 .",
    "similar studies have been done with  and  data ( finoguenov et al . 2002 ; ponman et al . 2003 ) .",
    "when the observed entropy values at @xmath5 are scaled with @xmath123 ( which is proportional to @xmath124 ) , both works found that groups have on average twice the scaled entropy of clusters .",
    "ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) further concluded that the excess entropy is observed in the full mass range .",
    "thus , the results from this work , v06 and v08 confirm the previous finding of the excess entropy at @xmath5 over the full mass range , but the magnitude of the excess is smaller and the difference between groups and clusters is also smaller than previous results , @xmath10 15% - 20% vs. @xmath10 100% in finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and ponman et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .    as pointed out by pratt et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the magnitude of the excess may be affected by the systematics of the @xmath27 relation , or how robust the hydrostatic equilibrium ( hse ) mass is .",
    "the nkv07 simulations show that the hse mass is systematically lower than the real mass and the difference is biggest in low - mass systems .",
    "the real mass is 45% higher than the hse mass for 1 kev groups , while the difference reduces to 13% for 10 kev clusters .",
    "the best - fit @xmath11 relation from this work and v06 ( @xmath297.1 ) is close to the relation for the hse mass in nkv07 .",
    "thus , if this bias is real , the actual entropy ratios at @xmath5 are smaller . for 1 kev groups , a 45% higher total mass means a 13% larger @xmath5 . for a typical entropy slope of 0.7 in this sample ( @xmath296.3 ) , the entropy ratio at @xmath5 is reduced by 17% .",
    "similarly for 5 kev clusters , the entropy ratio at @xmath5 is reduced by 8% for an average entropy slope of 0.9 at large radii .",
    "thus , this bias can explain only part of the entropy excess observed .",
    "the entropy baseline we adopted in this work is from the sph simulations , while the amr simulations produce a baseline with   7% higher normalization ( vkb05 ) , likely because of its better capability to catch shocks .",
    "however , the entropy excess for groups at @xmath5 remains significant .",
    "there are several mechanisms to achieve entropy amplification at @xmath5 .",
    "the first idea relies on modification of accretion , without extra non - gravitational processes ( ponman et al .",
    "2003 ; voit et al . 2003 ; voit & ponman 2003 ) .",
    "if preheating or feedback in small subhalos that are being accreted can eject gas out of the halo and thicken the filaments significantly , the accretion may be smoother than the lumpy accretion in hierarchical mergers .",
    "voit ( 2005 ) showed that the smooth accretion can generate @xmath10 50% more entropy throughout the cluster than would lumpy hierarchical accretion .",
    "however , borgani et al .",
    "( 2005 ) argued that this entropy amplification effect is substantially reduced by cooling .",
    "the other ideas resort to non - gravitational processes .",
    "as discussed in the last section , although the nkv07 simulations predict the @xmath119 relation very well , they produce too many stars .",
    "thus , models with only cooling may not be enough .",
    "borgani et al . (",
    "2005 ) showed that galactic winds from sn explosions are rather localized and can not boost entropy enough at large radii .",
    "thus , a feedback mechanism that can distribute heat in a very diffuse way is required .",
    "as groups are smaller than hot clusters , agn outflows from the central galaxy can reach a larger scaled radius .",
    "one good example in this sample is 3c449 ( @xmath298 and appendix ) , with radio lobes extending to at least 3.7 @xmath5 .",
    "thus , it is still an open question to explain the entropy excess at @xmath5 , especially in groups .",
    "but the much reduced entropy ratios from this work largely alleviate the problem .",
    "it is also clear that more systems with the entropy ratio constrained at @xmath5 are required for better comparison , especially @xmath122 kev groups .",
    "we also derived the entropy slopes at 30 kpc@xmath125 , 0.15 @xmath126 , @xmath127 ( or @xmath128 ) and @xmath129 ( fig .",

    "the measured average slopes in this work are consistent with the result by finoguenov et al .",
    "( 2007 ) ( 0.6 - 0.7 ) for groups .",
    "one of the most important aspects of cluster science is to use clusters to study cosmology , which often involves derivation of a cluster mass function . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , x - ray observations can be used to derive the cluster mass ( at least the hse value ) , provided the radial coverage of the data is good .",
    "often we estimate cluster mass from another x - ray observable used as a mass proxy . a frequently used mass proxy is gas temperature so it is important to understand the cluster @xmath27 relation .",

    "the stowed background allows us to separate the non - vignetted pb from the vignetted cxb .",
    "the main reason for our preference for the stowed background over the blank - sky background is that we have better control of the local background for nearby groups where sources fill the whole  field .",
    "the `` double subtraction '' method with the blank - sky background can not be applied for these nearby groups , as there is no region that is free of group emission .",
    "the derived local x - ray background based on stowed background also has a clear physical meaning and can be compared between  observations with very different pb fluxes or observations with other telescopes like .",

    "the blank - sky background data of each specific acis ccd may come from different combination of observations , especially for acis - s ( e.g. , s1 vs. s2+i3 ) .",

    "similarly , even if s3 is turned on for acis - i observations , it can not be used for local background study as the blank - sky background of the s3 chip ( when the aimpoint is on acis - i ) is only a subset of the acis - i blank - sky background data . on the contrary , with the stowed background",
    ", we are analyzing the absolute cxb in the interested field so data on different ccds can be fitted jointly to make better constraints .",
    "therefore , we used the stowed background to subtract the pb in our observations .",
    "the spectra of the  pb have been very stable ( e.g. , hm06 ) .",

    "we emphasize that the notation adopted here is only for the purpose of this work .",
    "we examined the spectral difference between these two periods , after matching their fluxes in the 9.5 - 12 kev band .",
    "the flux of the period d background is always a little lower than that of the period e background , after re - scaling .",
    "the biggest difference is seen on the s3 chip , with a 6.0% difference in the 0.35 - 7.0 kev band ( fig .",
    "the residual emission is very flat ( note it is non - vignetted ) and can be removed by increasing the d period background by 5.7% . the difference is smaller on the s1 chip , 2.4% in the 0.35 - 5.5 kev band ( note that the s1 pb increases rapidly at @xmath7 5.5 kev , fig . 6.21 of s proposers observatory guide v.9 ) .",
    "the difference is consistent with zero in fi chips , @xmath10 1% in the 0.5 - 7.0 kev band , excluding the au line in the 2.0 - 2.3 kev band .",
    "thus , we can apply the total stowed background ( 415 ks exposures ) to the fi data . for bi data , we use the stowed background in their corresponding periods .",
