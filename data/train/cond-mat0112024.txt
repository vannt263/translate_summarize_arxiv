    "in recent years the interest in the proximity effect between superconducting ( s ) and ferromagnetic ( f ) layers has increased considerably .",
    "the actual progress in the preparation of high quality metallic multilayer systems allows a careful study of the mutual interaction of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in hybrid s / f  structures .",
    "the proximity effect manifests itself in _",
    "e.g. _ changes of the density of states@xcite ( dos ) or in the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath5 on the thickness of the f - layer ( see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "many theoretical works have been devoted to the study of such structures , which is not a simple task . in most of them",
    "the dos and the critical temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath5 were analyzed in the `` dirty limit '' .",
    "this means that the retarded and advanced green s functions , which determine the thermodynamical properties , were obtained from the usadel equation ( e.g refs .",
    "@xcite ) which is simpler than the more general eilenberger equation . in other words",
    ", it was assumed that the mean free path @xmath6 is much shorter than any characteristic length ( with exception of the fermi wave length ) , and that all energies involved in the problem are smaller than @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the elastic relaxation time .",
    "in particular , the condition @xmath8 has to be satisfied ( @xmath0 is the exchange energy ) .",
    "it was shown that in this limit the dos in the f layer oscillates and decays with increasing exchange energy @xmath0 . in the limit @xmath9",
    "the period of the oscillations and the decay length are comparable to each other and are of the order @xmath10 .",
    "calculations in the opposite ( purely ballistic ) case were performed in refs.@xcite .",
    "haltermanns and valls @xcite solved the bogolyubov and self - consistency equations numerically and presented the results for the ldos in a f / s structure .",
    "zareyan and co - workers @xcite calculated the ldos of a f film in contact with a superconductor .",
    "they assumed that the electrons in the f film are scattered only at the rough f / vac surface ( vac stands for vacuum ) .",
    "however , not so much attention has been payed to the more realistic case @xmath11 . except for ref .",
    "@xcite , where this limit was considered for very thin ferromagnetic films , a study of the proximity effect in disordered ferromagnetic conductors with strong exchange energies @xmath0 is still lacking .",
    "this limit is very important when dealing with ferromagnetic layers made of transition metals , as fe or ni , for which @xmath12ev , and whose sizes are larger than the mean free path @xmath6 .    in the present paper , we analyze the dos and the critical temperature @xmath5 of the superconducting transition in s / f structures for which the condition    @xmath13    is satisfied . here",
    "@xmath2 is the elastic relaxation time due to impurity scattering in the bulk .",
    "according to condition ( [ clean ] ) the exchange interaction , which is proportional to @xmath0 is much stronger than the interaction with impurities , which is of the order of @xmath7 .",
    "we will show that in this limit the decay length of the superconducting condensate function induced in the ferromagnet is of the order of the mean free path @xmath6 .",
    "therefore , despite its smallness , it is very important to retain the impurity scattering term if the thickness of the f layer is larger than @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", the product @xmath14 may be smaller or larger than unity .",
    "we will see that in the limit ( [ clean ] ) thermodynamical quantities , such as dos and @xmath5 , differ considerably from those in the dirty @xcite and purely ballistic limits @xcite .",
    "as it has been pointed out in refs.@xcite , the usadel equation is not applicable in the limit ( [ clean ] ) , and the more general eilenberger equation should be solved .",
    "one can solve the latter equation with the help of an expansion in the parameter @xmath15 for both the strong and weak proximity effect . in the case of a weak proximity effect",
    "the solution can be obtained even for an arbitrary impurity concentration @xcite , i.e. for an arbitrary value of the parameter @xmath16 .",
    "it will be shown that in the limit of large @xmath17 the condensate function @xmath18 oscillates in space with a period @xmath19 and decays on a length of the order of the mean free path @xmath6 . if one neglects the impurity scattering in the bulk , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , the results for dos depend essentially on the boundary conditions at the f / vac interface .",
    "this is because in that case the condensate function @xmath18 @xmath20 is formed by interfering waves reflected from the f / vac boundary .",
    "therefore , the thermodynamical properties depend sensitively on whether these reflections are specular @xcite or diffusive @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we assume that the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer @xmath21 is much greater than the mean free path @xmath6 and therefore reflected waves are unimportant provided the bulk impurity scattering dominates .",
    "we show that in the main approximation in the parameter @xmath22 , the ldos in the ferromagnetic region in a f / s bilayer is not affected by the proximity effect . on the other hand",
    "the amplitude of the condensate function in the ferromagnet near the s / f interface is equal to that in the superconductor s if the interface transmittance is high , and decays away from the interface at distances of the order @xmath6 . in the limit ( [ clean ] ) , the mean free path @xmath6 is much larger than the period of the oscillations ( @xmath23 ) and may be comparable with @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , one can speak about long - range penetration of the superconducting condensate into the ferromagnet . in the presence of two superconductors ( e.g. in a",
    "s / f / s sandwich ) the situation changes : a correction to the dos in f arises in the main approximation and its magnitude depends on the phase difference between the superconductors and on the thickness @xmath21 of the f layer vanishing in the limit @xmath25 .",
    "we also analyze a variation of the critical temperature of the superconducting transition @xmath26 for a s / f bilayer for which the condition ( [ clean ] ) is satisfied .",
    "* we find the dependence of @xmath27 on the thickness @xmath28 of the superconductor in the limit @xmath29 and compare it with the results obtained in the dirty limit*.",

    "accordingly , further calculations are performed under certain assumptions that allow us to simplify equations ( [ eilenberger]-[zaitsev ] ) for values of parameters which still correspond to real systems .",

    "( [ greenf1 ] ) clearly shows that the penetration depth of the condensate is of the order of the mean free path @xmath6 and does not depend on the exchange field @xmath0 .",
