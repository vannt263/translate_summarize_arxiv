    "many of the exact results for effective actions in quantum field theory can be understood as integrated anomalous ward - identities which are protected from higher order corrections .",
    "well known examples are the integration of the chiral ( weyl ) anomaly for massless fermions in two dimensions coupled to a gauge ( graviational ) field or the veneziano - yankielowicz superpotential in @xmath2 yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the integration constant in turn reflects the choice of regularization and dynamical scale . in the latter example",
    "this constant is fixed by a one - instanton calculation @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to understand the exact results for the low energy effective action of @xmath3 yang - mills theory @xcite as an integrated anomaly equation .",
    "that the low energy effective action for @xmath4 yang - mills theory can be obtained by integrating the superconformal anomaly equation @xcite has been shown a while ago using a rather intricate series of arguments for gauge group @xmath5 for pure gauge theory in @xcite and including fundamental matter in @xcite .",
    "for @xmath6 without matter this can be understood as follows : the superconformal anomaly equation together with the @xmath7 structure of the mass formula implies an ordinary second order differential equation for the first derivative of the prepotential @xmath8 for the massless @xmath3 vector multiplet @xmath9 .",
    "what is more is that the parameters of this equation are completely fixed by the weak coupling asymptotics .",
    "the integration of this equation then determines the prepotential @xmath8 uniquely . for higher rank gauge groups , however , the superconformal anomaly equation of @xmath3 yang - mills is not sufficient simply because it only provides a single equation for a rank @xmath10 number of low energy fields",
    ".    on the other hand , recent work pioneered by vafa and collaborators @xcite using results on geometric transitions in string theory has lead , among other results , to a new string theoretic derivation of the low energy effective action in @xmath3 yang - mills theory .",
    "the starting point is a certain class of @xmath11 , @xmath2 theories obtained from @xmath3 yang - mills by adding a superpotential @xmath12 for the chiral multiplet that breaks the gauge symmetry @xmath13 .",
    "this theory can be geometrically engineered via d - branes partially wrapped over certain cycles of a calabi - yau geometry . at low energies ,",
    "the effective theory has a dual formulation where the branes are replaced by fluxes .",
    "furthermore , the dual theory is described in terms of the gluino condensate @xmath14 which , together with the massless @xmath15 vector multiplets @xmath16 in the @xmath17 , form an @xmath3 vector multiplet on the dual calabi - yau geometry @xcite .",
    "the holomorphic part of the effective action for this multiplet is that of an @xmath18 , @xmath3 yang - mills theory spontaneously broken to @xmath19 with a superpotential @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , this effective superpotential for the glueball superfield can be written as an integral of the holomorphic @xmath21-form over a blown up @xmath22 in the calabi - yau geometry , or equivalently , a period integral over a dual cycle in a genus @xmath23-riemann surface @xmath24 . in this formulation ,",
    "the effective couplings of the @xmath15 vector multiplets appear directly as the period matrix of this riemann surface . upon scaling the classical superpotential @xmath12 to zero",
    "one then recovers the @xmath4 theory at a point in the moduli space given by the minimum of @xmath12 .",
    "although the @xmath14 vanish in the @xmath4 limit the structure of the riemann surface @xmath24 survives and the limit for the coupling @xmath25 for the massless @xmath15 s is smooth .    in this paper we investigate how this structure can be seen to arise directly in the field theory formulation by integrating a suitable anomalous ward - identity .",
    "this program has in fact been to a large extent completed in @xcite where a certain generalization of the konishi anomaly was used to establish that the aforementioned riemann surface @xmath24 arises directly in the field theory limit .",
    "we should note that the prepotential for this theory has been understood a while ago via embedding in string theory @xcite and more recently through explicit multi - instanton computations to all orders @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the observation that the effective action can be understood as an integrated anomaly may put this result in its proper place within the exact results for effective actions and also removes some of the mystery surrounding this model . as we will explain",
    ", it also implies that the multi - instanton calculus in this model is , in fact , equivalent to an anomalous ward - identity together with a one - instanton calculation and thus should elucidate the structure of the multi - instanton calculus .",
    "the plan of this article is the following .",
    "in section 2 we review the chiral ring relations of @xcite relevant for our program and discuss the consequences of these relations for instanton calculus in the @xmath26 theory .",
    "in particular we argue in section 2.3 that a specific one - instanton calculation in the chiral ring together with an anomalous ward - identity completely determines the @xmath27-instanton contributions to the various quantities relevant in the @xmath26 theory .",
    "then , in section 3 we recall first the constructions of the prepotential @xmath28 and the effective couplings @xmath29 for the massless @xmath15 vector multiplets in terms of the hessian of @xmath28 w.r.t .",
    "the key difference with the effective prepotential @xmath8 for the @xmath4 theory on the coulomb branch is that while @xmath8 has an infinite expansion in @xmath30 and thus involves _ a priori _ an infinite number of instanton contributions , @xmath28 is a homogenous function of the `` glueball '' fields @xmath14 and the couplings @xmath31 of the superpotential . in particular , the role of the dynamical scale @xmath30 is reduced to setting the scale for the microscopic gauge coupling which can be evaluated in perturbation theory and a one - instanton calculation .",
    "what remains to be shown is that the hessian of @xmath28 is given by the period matrix of the riemann surface @xmath24 .",
    "we should note that while in the string theory description via geometric transition @xcite this is an immediate consequence of special geometry , the proof in the field theory description is more intricate . in sections 3.2 - 3.4",
    "we will show explicitly that this relation holds in the field theory description .",
    "this is the main technical result of this paper . for @xmath11 broken to @xmath32 and in the limit of vanishing superpotential , it allows us finally to express the low energy effective couplings for the massless @xmath15 vector multiplets in terms of the @xmath3",
    ", @xmath11 casimirs @xmath33 and in this way we derive the low energy effective action @xcite for @xmath34 yang - mills theory .",
    "this is done in section 3.5 .",
    "hence , the low energy effective action has been shown to follow from integrating an anomalous ward - identity .",
    "our starting point is @xmath3 @xmath11 yang - mills broken to an @xmath2 , @xmath32 theory . in @xmath2 superspace",
    "this theory is described by a chiral multiplet @xmath35 and a vector multiplet @xmath36 .",
    "we add to the corresponding action a classical superpotential @xmath37 for the chiral multiplet with @xmath38 as explained in @xcite an important role in the field theory derivation of the glueball potential is played by the ring of @xmath2 gauge - invariant chiral operators . since we will rely on these properties as well we present in this section a short summary of those that are relevant for us and discuss some consequences .",
    "the chiral ring is made up of gauge invariant operators @xmath39 which are chiral , ie .",
    "it follows immediately from this property that correlation functions of operators in the chiral ring in a supersymmetric vacuum ( @xmath41 ) are @xmath42-independent , ie .",
    "@xmath43 an important consequence of ( [ one ] ) is the factorization property @xmath44 .",
    "another property of chiral operators is that in a supersymmetric vacuum the expectation values of @xmath39 and @xmath45 are identical provided @xmath46 is some gauge invariant operator .",
    "thus , we consider the chiral ring as being generated by the equivalence classes @xmath47 one can represent ( not necessarily gauge invariant ) chiral operators as the lowest components of chiral superfields @xmath48 ( since @xmath49 ) . then , using @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the super- and gauge covariant derivative , one finds that @xmath52 ( anti ) commutes with @xmath48 in the chiral ring .",
    "taking this into account one sees that the @xmath19 chiral ring is generated by the elements @xmath53 in the rest of this paper certain relations between elements of the chiral ring will play a crucial role . in order to describe these relations for the complete set of elements simultaneously",
    "it is useful to introduce a generating function for all elements of the chiral ring .",
    "such a generating function is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a grassman - valued parameter .",
    "the various elements of the chiral ring are then given by the coefficients in the expansion of @xmath57 in powers of @xmath56 and @xmath58 .",
    "as explained in the introduction the basic idea we will employ is to integrate an anomalous ward identity in order to obtain the effective action for the massless degrees of freedom in the coulomb branch of @xmath4 yang - mills theory .",
    "concretely this anomaly is manifested as a quantum correction to a classical relation in the chiral ring .",
    "the relation we consider is simply a consequence of the equation of motion , @xmath59 , where @xmath12 is the classical superpotential .",
    "since classically @xmath60 commutes with any chiral field we can multiply this equation by @xmath61 to get @xmath62 upon quantization , normal ordering effects have to be taken into account which lead to an anomaly in the above relation @xcite .",
    "this anomaly can be determined , for instance , using pauli - villars regularisation ( e.g. @xcite ) . in perturbation",
    "theory this one loop calculation is exact .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that for the types of superpotentials considered here there are no non - perturbative corrections to the anomaly .",
    "the anomalous relation is then given by @xcite @xmath63 \\right]_{lk}\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath64 are the entries of the matrix @xmath35 .",
    "note that the above equation still holds if we replace @xmath52 by @xmath65 since @xmath56 ( anti ) commutes with everything . still following @xcite and using the identity @xmath66\\right]_{lk}= \\tr\\left(\\frac{\\chi_1\\chi_2}{z-\\phi}\\right ) \\tr\\left(\\frac{\\chi_1\\chi_2}{z-\\phi}\\right)\\,,\\ ] ] valid in the chiral ring for anti commuting operators @xmath67 and @xmath68 and taking expectation values , we have @xmath69 finally , recalling the factorization properties of the chiral ring this leads to @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a polynomial of order @xmath72 in @xmath73 defined by @xmath74 the coefficients @xmath75 are thus given by @xmath76 where we have defined @xmath77 eqn .",
    "( [ rq ] ) is then solved for @xmath78 as @xmath79 in the above expectation values it is understood that the high energy degrees of freedom have been integrated out while the low energy degrees of freedom play the role of background fields which are assumed to take values compatible with unbroken supersymmetry , so that the chiral ring properties are realized .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that each solution of the chiral ring relations corresponds to a supersymmetric vacuum of the gauge theory . in what follows",
    "we consider the case where the @xmath11 gauge symmetry is broken down to @xmath32 .",
    "in analogy with the case where the breaking is to a product of @xmath17 groups , we take the low energy fields to be the massless @xmath80 vector multiplets @xmath81 together with the glueball superfields @xmath14 with the condensate of the massless gluinos as their lowest components .",
    "in particular , the chiral multiplet which acquires a mass due to the classical superpotential @xmath12 is integrated out .",
    "the light degrees of freedom are then conveniently combined with the help of the auxiliary variable @xmath56 as @xmath82 where the contour @xmath83 is around the cut extending from the @xmath84-th minimum of the function @xmath85 which are assumed to be non - degenerate .",
    "the details concerning the projection onto @xmath14 in terms of the contour integrals can be found in @xcite .",
    "it follows from ( [ m1 ] ) that the expectation value @xmath78 depends on @xmath56 only implicitly through the @xmath86 .",
    "furthermore , defining @xmath87 and using eq.([rl ] ) gives @xmath88 note also that @xmath86 can be considered as a function of the variables @xmath31 and @xmath89 and conversely @xmath90 .",
    "the result ( [ rl ] ) , obtained in @xcite shows the appearance of a genus @xmath91 riemann surface @xmath24 defined by eq.([reim1 ] ) ( evaluated at @xmath92 ) as a consequence of the anomalous relation ( [ ar ] ) in the chiral ring .",
    "the period matrix @xmath93 of @xmath24 will be identified with the low energy effective couplings @xmath94 of the massless fields in the coulomb branch of the @xmath4 theory . in order to establish this result",
    "we first need to understand how @xmath95 enters in the effective action for the massless vector multiplets @xmath96 .",
    "this is done in section 3 .      as explained above the expectation values in eqn .",
    "( [ rq ] ) stand for integrating out the high energy degrees of freedom in the presence of the `` external '' fields @xmath14 and @xmath96 .",
    "however , another interpretation is possible in which all degrees of freedom are integrated out . in this case",
    "the coefficients @xmath97 defined by eq.([fi ] ) are functions of @xmath31 only .",
    "if the superpotential is such that the gauge symmetry is broken to @xmath32 , then there is no strong infrared dynamics such that the coefficients @xmath97 can be evaluated by treating the superpotential perturbatively in the @xmath26 theory .",
    "in addition @xmath97 , or rather @xmath98 ( see eqn . ( [ tkdef ] ) ) is saturated by classical and instanton contributions .",
    "this is because @xmath99 is annihilated by @xmath100 implying that the path integral localizes on just these configurations .",
    "concretely we have for the @xmath101-instanton contribution @xmath102 with @xmath103 and subject to the constraints @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "these selection rules can be understood from symmetries @xcite or alternatively by looking at the details of the @xmath101-instanton calculation : since we are expanding about the theory with vanishing superpotential ( @xmath106 ) only non - negative powers of @xmath31 appear in the expansion yang - mills theory ( see @xcite and references therein ) where gauge and dilatation symmetry is spontaneously broken from the outset . ] . in order to get a non - vanishing contribution from an instanton with topological charge",
    "@xmath101 we need to saturate the @xmath107 fermionic zero modes : two gluino zero modes appear in @xmath108 .",
    "further zero modes appear by expanding in terms of the yukawa coulings @xmath109 .",
    "it is then not hard to see that in order to produce @xmath110 gluino @xmath111 and `` quark ''",
    "@xmath112 zero modes we need to have exactly one contribution @xmath113 from the potential @xmath114 .",
    "this explains the first selection rule given above .",
    "furthermore , the total number of scalars contained in @xmath99 and @xmath115 must match the @xmath116 scalars coming from the expansion in the yukawa couplings .",
    "this then leads to the second selection rule stated above which now has the interpretation of a tree level amplitude in the presence of @xmath107 fermionic zero modes .",
    "a consequence of these selection rules is that the @xmath99 s vanish for @xmath117 and @xmath118 is determined by a 1-instanton contribution .    for @xmath119",
    "the connected part of @xmath120 is still subject to the selection rules above and similarly for the connected part of @xmath121 , that is @xmath122 here the connected part of the expectation value is the part that can not be written as a product of expectation values with less than @xmath123 fields . in particular , for @xmath124 , @xmath33 is fully determined by its classical expression in terms of the @xmath31 s .",
    "combining the selection rules for ( [ fkeval ] ) and ( [ ukeval ] ) with the chiral ring relation ( [ rl ] ) one then concludes that the expansions of @xmath99 and @xmath33 in the dynamical scale @xmath30 are completely determined by a single @xmath125-instanton calculation and the classical expressions for the @xmath33 , @xmath126 .",
    "indeed , expanding both sides of eq.([rq ] ) in @xmath127 we obtain the recurrence relation @xmath128 where @xmath129 .",
    "the recursion relation is then obtained by comparing equal powers in @xmath73 ( see also @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "an important application of this discussion is that , of the coefficients @xmath97 , only @xmath130 is non - vanishing @xcite and is then equal to @xmath131 .",
    "the factor @xmath132 can in principle be determined by evaluating @xmath118 in the explicit one - instanton computation .",
    "instead we will determine @xmath132 below by comparison with the @xmath125-instanton contribution to the superconformal anomaly in the @xmath3 theory .",
    "this , with the help of ( [ rl ] ) , fixes @xmath78 and , in particular , @xmath14 completely in terms of the @xmath31 and the one - instanton coefficient @xmath130 .",
    "this suggests that the chiral ring relations , or equivalently the konishi anomaly imply a relation between instanton contributions of different topological charges ( see @xcite for other approaches to instanton recursion relations ) .",
    "in order to determine the couplings of the massless u(1 ) vector multiplets @xmath133 , we will need to determine the holomorphic part of the effective action for these fields . in the @xmath26 theory this action is usually expressed in terms of a prepotential @xmath8 for the @xmath26 vector multiplet @xmath9 .",
    "however , as explained in the introduction this prepotential involves an infinite number of instanton contributions .",
    "the key observation @xcite allowing to circumvent this problem is that the low energy effective couplings can equally be obtained from an effective superpotential @xmath134 which in contrast to @xmath8 does not receive higher instantons contributions .      in analogy with the usual effective action in field theory the holomorphic part of the effective action is given by the sum over 1pi graphs with @xmath14 and @xmath96 insertions .",
    "in fact we can say more .",
    "a `` non - renormalisation theorem '' given in @xcite shows that in perturbation theory the only contributions , compatible with the expected symmetries of the effective action come from planar graphs .",
    "furthermore these planar graphs have either exactly one @xmath96 insertion at two of the index loops and one @xmath14 insertion at each of the remaining index loops or one @xmath14 insertion in all but one index loop . the index loop without @xmath14 insertion being proportional to @xmath135 , where @xmath136 counts the degeneracy of the vacuum corresponding to the @xmath137 minimum of the potential .",
    "this observation then implies that the holomorphic part of the effective action for the low energy fields can be expressed in terms of a single function @xmath138 .",
    "indeed let @xmath138 be the sum over all 1pi graphs with exactely one @xmath14 insertion at each of the index loops . then , since the effective potential is obtained by either replacing one @xmath14 by @xmath135 or two @xmath14 insertions by @xmath96 s , we have @xmath139 this latter relation can be written equivalently as @xmath140 where @xmath141 is obtained from @xmath138 simply by the substitution @xmath142 . in order to evaluate the coupling for the massless @xmath15 fields @xmath96 we then set the @xmath14 `` on shell '' .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of implementing this . in the last section",
    "we have seen that on shell the @xmath97 s are expressed in terms of @xmath31 . on the other hand , from the point of view of @xmath143",
    "this means that @xmath144 so that the coupling matrix is @xmath145    however , to compare ( [ mat ] ) with the couplings for the massless @xmath15 vector multiplets in @xmath146 @xmath4 yang - mills we need to change variables from the @xmath147 to usual cartan - weyl basis for @xmath146 .",
    "we will call these variables @xmath148 , @xmath149 .",
    "they are defined by @xmath150 while @xmath151 . in particular",
    ", @xmath152 vanishes on shell .",
    "the couplings for the @xmath153 are then given by @xmath154 .    in principle @xmath138",
    "can now be computed directly order by order in perturbation theory is a homogenous function in @xmath31 and @xmath14 .",
    "in particular the instanton contributions are summarized in the @xmath31-independent integration constant which is fixed by a one - instanton calculation .",
    "see also @xcite for a discussion of the ambiguities in the field theory computation of @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xcite ( or in an associated matrix model @xcite ) .",
    "however , for the couplings , we only need its second derivative @xmath138 with respect to @xmath14 .",
    "we will now show explicitely that the hessian of @xmath155 can be expressed in terms of the period matrix of the riemann surface described by ( [ reim1 ] ) .",
    "this is the main technical result of the present paper .",
    "first we recall a result in @xcite relating the derivative of @xmath138 with respect to @xmath31 to the expectation value of @xmath156 introduced in section [ scr ] . to start with we have from eq.([wphi ] ) @xmath157 on the other hand @xmath143 is expressed in terms of @xmath138 via eq.([fwpsi ] ) .",
    "the claim is that this implies @xmath158 the identity ( [ peffphi ] ) follows from the observation that the right hand side depends on the background fields @xmath159 only in the combination @xmath86 . on the other hand",

    "both sides vanish at @xmath161 .",

    "let us then compare this result with the @xmath31-independent term in @xmath243 .",
    "this can be done using a scaling argument ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "suppose we rescale all couplings @xmath31 by @xmath111 , so that @xmath244 , @xmath245 and consider @xmath246 which is thus given by @xmath247 if we then let @xmath111 go to infinity , @xmath248 goes to zero .",
    "geometrically this limit corresponds to vanishing @xmath83 cycles since @xmath249 .",
    "therefore we can rotate the two endpoints of the cut along one vanishing cycle @xmath83 .",
    "under such a transformation , @xmath14 picks up a phase @xmath250 .",
    "the transformation of the cycles can be worked out from figure [ mono ] : under a monodromy transformation @xmath251 all the @xmath163 change to @xmath252 while under a monodromy transformation @xmath253 , with @xmath254 , only @xmath163 is changed in @xmath255 .     for @xmath256 [ mono],height=113 ]    this implies the asymptotic form of the period integrals @xmath257 where @xmath258 is an invariant polynomial of @xmath259 and @xmath260 with no constant term as the period integrals vanish in the limit @xmath261 .",
    "therefore , we get for large @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) @xmath264 where @xmath265 is a @xmath31-independent linear combination in @xmath266 and @xmath267 since only the linear terms of @xmath268 contribute in the limit @xmath269 . on the other hand",
    "we see from ( [ scales ] ) that rescaling of @xmath31 by @xmath111 corresponds simply to rescaling of @xmath230 so that we get @xmath270 where the dots refer to terms which depend on @xmath31 and where we have used the property that any choice of the basis of cycles @xmath83 is physically equivalent .",
    "thus , the comparison of eq.([fbhi ] ) on one hand with eq.([gkindependent ] ) and eq.([in110 ] ) on the other hand give that the `` integration constant '' @xmath271 is linear or more precisely that @xmath272 the result ( [ eq53 ] ) enables us then by use of eq.([deriofy ] ) to obtain the low energy couplings @xmath273 for the vector multiplets in terms of the period matrix of the riemann surface @xmath24 defined by anomalous chiral ring relations ( [ reim1 ] ) , that is @xmath274 where @xmath275 denotes the value on shell .",
    "in particular @xmath276 vanishes .",
    "since the terms proportional to @xmath277 do not match the structure of the @xmath125-loop correction , we have @xmath278 .",
    "furthermore , using the result @xmath279 on shell , @xmath24 is given by @xmath280 the constant @xmath132 will be fixed in the next subsection .      to complete our derivation of the low energy couplings for the massless u(1 ) vector multiplets",
    "@xmath133 we first need to express the period matrix in eq.([tauf ] ) in terms of the casimir variables @xmath281 , @xmath282 ) , of the @xmath3 theory @xcite and then fix the constant @xmath132 appearing in the equation for the riemann surface @xmath24 .    for this purpose ,",
    "if @xmath283 is the classical value of @xmath284 obtained by extremizing the tree - level superpotential , we write @xmath285 , where the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath286 depend on @xmath287 through the relation @xmath288 we know however from section 2.3 .",
    "that there are no quantum corrections to the casimir variables i.e. that @xmath289 .",
    "thus , @xmath290 and the equation ( [ tauf2 ] ) for @xmath24 becomes @xmath291 or equivalently @xmath292 the low energy couplings @xmath94 are thus given by the period matrix of the riemann surface @xmath24 defined by eq.([y ] ) .",
    "furthermore , since the expectation values of the massless scalars are given by @xmath293 we get from eq.([eqlast ] ) together with eq.([y ] ) @xmath294 the two equations ( [ tauf ] ) and ( [ a ] ) then determine the prepotential @xmath295 via @xmath296 up to physically irrelevant integration constants @xcite .",
    "finally let us fix the constant @xmath132 .",
    "this can be done in several ways . here",
    "we will fix @xmath132 by comparing the prediction for the observable @xmath297 with the explicit one - instanton calculation .",
    "indeed , we have on one hand from the superconformal ward identity @xcite @xmath298 upon substitution of the asymptotic instanton expansion for @xmath299 this then leads to @xcite @xmath300 with @xcite @xmath301 . here",
    "@xmath302 stands for the diagonal entries of @xmath303 .",
    "eqn ( [ 58 ] ) is then a direct consequence of ( [ tauf ] ) and ( [ tauf2 ] ) . on the other hand , comparing ( [ 58 ] ) with the explicit one - instanton calculation @xcite implies then @xmath304 .",
    "thus we have shown that the low energy couplings are indeed given by the period matrix of @xmath24 with @xmath304 .",
    "in this article we have completed the field theory proof of the claim that the holomorphic effective action of @xmath3 @xmath146 yang - mills action can be obtained by integrating a suitable anomaly . in particular",
    ", we have field the gap that arises in field theory ( not present in string theory ) due to the absence of special geometry relation between the periods of the riemann surface @xmath24 .",
    "in addition we have pointed out that the anomalous chiral ring relations have important consequences for the multi - instanton calculus .",
    "indeed , the instanton contributions to the expectation values of chiral ring elements are completely fixed by the @xmath125-instanton observable @xmath305 .",
    "this also applies in a similar way to the expectation value @xmath306 . on the other hand ,",
    "expanding the contour integral in @xmath30 one reads off the contribution of the @xmath27-instanton contribution to the function @xmath307 ( or equivalently @xmath308 ) .",
    "this seems to suggest a recursive structure that would be interesting to investigate within the multi - instanton calculus .",

    "in this appendix , we prove that @xmath309 is homogeneous of degree 1 in @xmath14 and @xmath31 . for that purpose , we compute the various derivatives of @xmath184 and compare the results obtained with the expression ( [ whatisy ] ) of @xmath184 found in section [ sectiony ] , @xmath310    the general strategy in the computations that will be done is to identify the holomorphic contributions .",
    "let us recall at this stage that the space of holomorphic forms on the riemann surface @xmath24 is @xmath311 dimensional and two special basis are @xmath312 and @xmath313 with @xmath179 and @xmath314 .",
    "we change then the variables from @xmath315 to @xmath316 where @xmath317 is the coefficient of order @xmath84 of @xmath318 .",

    "we first compute the derivative w.r.t .",
    "we have successively : @xmath324 the first contribution in the r.h.s . of ( [ r3 ] )",
    "is a linear combination of holomorphic terms while the second term is a meromorphic form that has residue @xmath125 at infinity .",
    "consider then the case @xmath325 . in that case",

    "thus @xmath328 is a 1-form whose @xmath83 integrals for @xmath327 vanish and which has residue @xmath125 at infinity .",
    "however , there is an unique form satisfying these properties and by definition it is @xmath329 .",
    "thus , we have shown that @xmath330 take then @xmath331 . for @xmath332 ,",
    "we get @xmath333 . thus , if we define the @xmath125-form @xmath334 we have on one hand @xmath335 for @xmath336 and on the other hand @xmath337 .",
    "thus , for the same reason as above we have @xmath338 and so @xmath339 it is now easy to compute the derivatives w.r.t . @xmath153 and @xmath193 to get @xmath340",
    "let us compute now the derivative w.r.t .",
    "we have : @xmath341 suppose now that @xmath342 .",
    "then , in eq.([derygk ] ) , the first term is equal to @xmath343 , the second term is holomorphic and the third term vanishes by use of eq.([derfn1 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have @xmath344 . if @xmath345 , it is easy to see that we come to the same conclusion thanks again to eq.([derfn1 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath346 and thus @xmath347 we conclude that @xmath184 is homogeneous of degree one in @xmath348 ( and thus in @xmath349 ) by comparing eq.([newwhatisy ] ) with the results ( [ derai ] ) , ( [ derplus ] ) and ( [ dergk ] ) .",
