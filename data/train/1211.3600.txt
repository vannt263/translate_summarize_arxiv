    "weak decays of quarkonium states such as @xmath2 , @xmath8 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , etc . , offer a window into what may lie beyond the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "the reason for the expected sensitivity is that the rates of the quarkonium weak decays are expected to be tiny in the framework of the sm  @xcite .",
    "as originally pointed out by singer  @xcite , the weak decays @xmath15 ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and charge conjugate state implicitly included ) are purely second class with a vector - type coupling in the sm ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the definition of the second class current ) , and hence vanish in the limit of exact isospin symmetry .",
    "they occur in the sm in first order in the weak interaction , but only due to @xmath18-parity breaking effects , i.e. due to electromagnetic corrections and the mass - difference of the @xmath19- and @xmath20-quarks  @xcite . for @xmath2 semileptonic",
    "weak decays , a one - loop calculation was performed in chiral perturbation theory within the sm , including a systematic treatment of the electromagnetic contributions to @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 are electromagnetic coupling and typical momentum transfer in the decay as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and a rather accurate upper bound for the branching fraction of @xmath24 is predicted to be @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , any observation of @xmath26 violating this bound would be a clear indication for new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the decays @xmath26 can be used to probe some types of possible new charged current interactions  @xcite .",
    "a rather old suggestion would be the introduction of a new second class vector current for the @xmath27 transition  @xcite .",
    "scalar - type charged current four - fermion interactions can arise in gauge theories for example from the exchange of charged higgs bosons in the two - higgs - doublet model  @xcite .",
    "also light leptoquarks  @xcite , occurring naturally in grand unified theories and composite models , may enhance the @xmath28 branching faction considerably  @xcite .",
    "for example , by considering scalar or vector type interaction , the branching fraction of @xmath24 was estimated to be @xmath29  @xcite , which is a few order of magnitudes higher than that in the sm .",
    "therefore , searches for the @xmath24 and @xmath30 at the branching fractions level of @xmath29 and below will provide information on the new physics beyond the sm . at present",
    "there is no experimental information on the decays @xmath28 . in this paper",
    ", we present measurements of branching fractions of @xmath2 and @xmath31 decays .",
    "this analysis is based on @xmath32 @xmath13 events  @xcite , accumulated with the beijing spectrometer iii ( besiii ) detector  @xcite , at the beijing electron positron collider ii ( bepcii ) .",
    "bepcii / besiii  @xcite is a major upgrade of the besii experiment at the bepc accelerator .",
    "the design peak luminosity of the double - ring @xmath1 collider , , is @xmath33 @xmath34s@xmath35 at the center - of - mass energy of 3770 mev .",
    "the besiii detector has a geometrical acceptance of 93% of @xmath36 and consists of four main components : ( 1 ) a small - celled , helium - based main drift chamber ( mdc ) with 43 layers , which provides measurements of ionization energy loss ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the average single wire resolution is 135 @xmath17 m , and the momentum resolution for charged particles with momenta of 1 gev/@xmath38 in a 1 t magnetic field is 0.5% ; ( 2 ) an electromagnetic calorimeter ( emc ) made of 6240 csi ( tl ) crystals arranged in a cylindrical shape ( barrel ) plus two end - caps . for 1.0 gev photons ,",
    "the energy resolution is 2.5% in the barrel and 5% in the end - caps , and the position resolution is 6 mm in the barrel and 9 mm in the end - caps ; ( 3 ) a time - of - flight system ( tof ) for particle identification ( pid ) composed of a barrel part made of two layers with 88 pieces of 5 cm thick and 2.4 m long plastic scintillators in each layer , and two end - caps with 96 fan - shaped , 5 cm thick , plastic scintillators in each end - cap .",
    "the time resolution is 80 ps in the barrel , and 110 ps in the end - caps , corresponding to a 2@xmath39 k/@xmath40 separation for momenta up to about 1.0 gev/@xmath38 ; ( 4 ) a muon chamber system made of 1000 m@xmath41 of resistive - plate - chambers arranged in 9 layers in the barrel and 8 layers in the end - caps and incorporated in the return iron of the super - conducting magnet .",
    "the position resolution is about 2 cm .",
    "the optimization of the event selection and the estimation of physics backgrounds are performed using monte carlo ( mc ) simulated data samples .",
    "the geant4-based simulation software boost  @xcite includes the geometric and material description of the besiii detectors , the detector response and digitization models , as well as the track records of the detector running conditions and performance .",
    "the production of the @xmath13 resonance is simulated by the mc event generator kkmc  @xcite ; the known decay modes are generated by evtgen  @xcite with branching ratios taken from the particle data group ( pdg ) tables  @xcite and determined by the lundcharm model lundcharm  @xcite for the remaining unknown decays .",
    "the analysis is performed in the framework of the besiii offline software system  @xcite which takes care of the detector calibration , event reconstruction and data storage .",
    "in order to detect @xmath2 and @xmath31 decays , we use @xmath4 and @xmath5 decays .",
    "these two - body decays provide a very simple event topology , in which the @xmath6 signals can be reconstructed easily and cleanly decaying into @xmath7 .",
    "the reconstructed @xmath6 particles can be used to tag @xmath2 and @xmath8 in order to allow a search for their semileptonic decays . in addition , the @xmath2 and @xmath8 decays are easy to define in the lab system due to the strong boost of the @xmath6 from @xmath13 decay .",
    "charged tracks in the besiii detector are reconstructed using track - induced signals in the mdc .",
    "we select tracks within @xmath43 cm of the interaction point in the beam direction and within 1 cm in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "the tracks must be within the mdc fiducial volume , @xmath44 ( @xmath45 is the polar angle with respect to the @xmath46 beam direction ) .",
    "candidate events require four charged tracks with net charge zero .",
    "the tof and @xmath37 information are combined to form pid confidence levels for the @xmath40 , @xmath47 , and @xmath22 hypotheses ; each track is assigned to the particle type that corresponds to the hypothesis with the highest confidence level . to suppress background from @xmath48 , where @xmath2  ( @xmath8 ) decays into nonleptonic modes , the electron candidate is further identified with the ratio of deposited energy in the emc to track momentum , @xmath49 , which must be larger than 0.8 .",
    "we further require that @xmath49 should be less than 0.8 for the pion candidate to suppress background from @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) decay .",
    "showers identified as photon candidates must satisfy fiducial and shower - quality requirements .",
    "the minimum energy is 25 mev for emc barrel showers ( @xmath52 ) and 50 mev for end - cap showers ( @xmath53 ) . to eliminate showers produced by charged particles",
    ", a photon must be isolated from any charged track by more than @xmath54 if not specified otherwise .",
    "since the mass of neutrino is almost zero and it is invisible in the detectors , a one - constraint ( 1c ) kinematic fit is performed to constrain the missing mass of the reconstructed tracks to be zero , and @xmath55 @xmath56 is required .",
    "the 1c fit improves the resolution of recoil mass of the @xmath7 system by a factor of 2.5 for @xmath2 case or a factor of 1.6 for @xmath8 case .",
    "after the 1c fit , the missing momentum @xmath57 can be calculated ; here , @xmath58 in the rest frame of @xmath13 , and we require that the missing momentum should be larger than @xmath59 gev/@xmath38 to suppress backgrounds from final states with only four tracks , such as @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "we count the number @xmath62 of emc showers that could originate from a @xmath63 or a photon , and require that @xmath62 be zero in the region inside a cone of 0.3 ( 1.5 ) rad around the direction of the missing momentum for @xmath64 [ @xmath65 .",
    "these requirements reject most @xmath2 and @xmath8 decays into nonleptonic final states .",
    "they also eliminate most backgrounds from multi - body decays of @xmath66 .",
    "the different requirements on the cone angle for the @xmath2 and @xmath8 cases are made because of the following two reasons : firstly , in the @xmath67 decays , the booster for @xmath2 is stranger than that for @xmath8 in the central of mass energy of @xmath13 , which leads to a larger open angle for the @xmath8 decay products than that for the @xmath2 decay products in the detector .",
    "secondly , the most dangerous backgrounds are from @xmath68 decay , in which one of the charged pions is mis - identified as an electron . meanwhile , the decay rate for @xmath69 is more than 6 times larger than the rate for @xmath70  @xcite .",
    "figures  [ phie ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the invariant mass distribution of @xmath7 candidates , @xmath71 , after the above selections .",
    "clear @xmath6 signals are seen .",
    "the invariant mass of @xmath72 can be obtained as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",

    "we use mc simulated events to determine selection efficiencies for the signal channels and study possible backgrounds . with phase space mc simulations",
    ", we obtain efficiencies of 17.9% and 17.4% for @xmath2 and @xmath8 semileptonic decays , respectively . according to the study of the @xmath13 inclusive mc sample ,",
    "more than 20 exclusive decay modes are identified as potential background modes , and are studied with full mc simulations in order to understand the backgrounds .",
    "the sources of backgrounds are divided into two classes .",
