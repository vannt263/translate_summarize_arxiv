    "the system comprising of a single quantum particle tunneling in the presence of a many - particle environment is of fundamental interest in the study of decoherence and is relevant to certain well - known models such as the spin - boson model and the kondo problem @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider a trapped ultracold atom version : a single distinguishable ` impurity ' atom and @xmath0 indistinguishable bosons all trapped together in a double - well potential . within the single - band two - site bose - hubbard model both the impurity and",
    "the bosons become two level systems , i.e.  pseudo - spins .",
    "this model has previously been studied by rinck and bruder @xcite , by us @xcite , and by lu and co - workers @xcite . closely related but distinct models that have been studied recently",
    "include the cases of an impurity atom trapped in a double - well and coupled to a uniform bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) @xcite , an atomic quantum dot acting as a coherent single - atom or photon shuttle between two becs @xcite or two optical resonator modes  @xcite , respectively , and of two impurities immersed in a bec @xcite .",
    "also related are studies of double - wells containing becs of two different species , a system suited to investigating the quantum aspects of phase separation @xcite .",
    "away from the immediate arena of cold atoms , essentially the same hamiltonian as we shall use here occurs in the mermin central - spin model ( also known as the spin star model ) which can be pictured as a central distinguished spin coupled equally to @xmath0 surrounding spins located on the points of a star @xcite .",
    "various elements of our proposed system are already well established in the laboratory , although combining them may of course prove challenging .",
    "for example , tunnel coupled atomic becs ( bosonic josephson junctions ) have been realized in a variety of different ways including the case where the double - well might be an actual external potential @xcite , or be formed from two hyperfine states whose coupling is controlled by microwave / radio frequency fields ( internal josephson effect ) @xcite .",
    "although binary mixtures of becs in the same trap were first made in the early days of atomic bec @xcite , placing just one or a controllable number of atoms in a trap is harder but can now be done @xcite .",
    "one set - up which is quite close to the one we have in mind here was achieved in an experiment where an optical lattice containing a bose - fermi mixture was suddenly ramped up to a large depth @xcite .",
    "this resulted in an array of traps each containing either one or zero fermions together with a small number of coherent bosons .",
    "the depth of the lattice effectively shut off tunnel coupling between the wells in that experiment but ramping to smaller lattice depths would leave tunneling switched on .",
    "we also note in this context that optical lattices are versatile enough that they can be manipulated to produce a lattice of double - wells  @xcite .    in our previous paper @xcite we studied the symmetry breaking bifurcation that occurs in the ground state above a critical value of the boson - impurity interaction strength .",
    "the symmetry that is broken is a @xmath1 parity symmetry whose physical order parameter is the expectation value of the difference in the number of bosons between the left and right wells ( or the corresponding quantity for the impurity ) which spontaneously develops a non - zero value at the bifurcation . from the energetic point of view , above the critical interaction strength it becomes preferable for the impurity to localize in one well and for the bosons to favor the other ( assuming a repulsive boson - impurity interaction ) leading to a number imbalance .",
    "closely related symmetry breaking bifurcations have been studied experimentally in purely bosonic josephson junctions ( no impurity ) @xcite , in spin - orbit coupled becs  @xcite , and in becs in cavities @xcite . in the case of @xcite",
    "the bifurcation arises from the nonlinearity due to boson - boson interactions @xcite and is thought to become a full blown quantum phase transition ( qpt ) in the limit that @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "when the interactions are attractive this bifurcation occurs in the ground state , spontaneously breaking the symmetry so that the bosons clump together in either the left or right well . when the interactions are repulsive the bifurcation breaks the symmetry of excited states and manifests itself physically as the transition from josephson oscillations to macroscopic self - trapping , i.e.  a dynamical phase transition @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the purely bosonic josephson junction , in our system it is the nonlinearity due to the boson - impurity interaction that leads to symmetry breaking and this can occur in the ground state for either repulsive or attractive interactions .",
    "self - trapping due to the boson - impurity interaction can also occur as we shall see .    for a perfectly balanced double - well the number difference symmetry",
    "is only broken in the mean - field theory : in the fully quantum treatment the many - body wave function in fock space ( number difference space ) develops non - gaussian number fluctuations and eventually separates into two macroscopically distinguishable pieces , i.e.  a schrdinger cat state .",
    "this state is notoriously delicate and tiny external perturbations not included in the hamiltonian are liable to break the symmetry by effectively introducing a tilt between the two wells .",
    "this collapses the cat state and thereby restores the validity of the mean - field result .",
    "another difference between the full quantum theory and the mean - field theory is that the latter is nonlinear and this is the origin of the bifurcation which takes the form of a 3-pronged pitchfork when the number difference is plotted as a function of the boson - impurity interaction strength and appears as a swallowtail loop @xcite ( see figure [ fig : glnou ] below ) when the energy is plotted versus an externally imposed tilt ( which plays a role analogous to quasimomentum @xcite ) .",
    "these iconic loop structures also occur in many other bifurcating systems including bosonic josephson junctions @xcite , the band structure of becs in optical lattices @xcite including at the dirac point for a honeycomb lattice @xcite , the band structure of non - interacting atoms in cavity - qed @xcite , and the equivalent of band structure for becs in toroidal traps @xcite .",
    "their presence has also been inferred experimentally due to a sudden break down in adiabaticity during a parametric sweep of the tilt between wells in a bosonic josephson junction @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we shall show that at the same time the bifurcation appears the mean - field dynamics goes from regular to chaotic .",
    "this feature does not occur in the ordinary bosonic josephson junction ( when treated within the standard two - mode model ) .",
    "indeed , by adding an additional degree of freedom like a spin chaos has been predicted to appear in both mean - field becs  @xcite and bosonic josephson junctions  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , chaos may also occur by removing energy conservation @xcite .",
    "chaos is a classical phenomenon that is usually defined as exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , that is , two arbitrarily close points in phase space will diverge exponentially over time . in quantum mechanics , precise trajectories do not exist and positions in phase space can not be defined than better to an area of size @xmath3 precluding the possibility of exponential sensitivity .",
    "nevertheless , quantum systems whose classical limit is chaotic do display tell - tale behaviour such as level repulsion leading to the idea of quantum chaology @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate chaos via poincar plots giving stroboscopic sections through classical ( mean - field ) phase space and also by monitoring the statistics of the quantum energy levels .",
    "similar regular - to - chaotic behavior as we observe has recently been predicted in the celebrated dicke model @xcite .",
    "indeed , in this paper we make the claim that our model is a poor man s version of the dicke model , behaving identically if one is close to the bifurcation .",
    "the original dicke model described @xmath0 two - level atoms coupled to a single mode of the electromagnetic field and undergoes a quantum phase transition to a superradiant phase corresponding to the collective emission of photons at a critical value of the atom - light coupling strength @xcite .",
    "alternatively stated , the dicke model consists of @xmath0 spins coupled to a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the physical basis of our claim of the equivalence of the two models is that very near the critical point the harmonic oscillator is barely excited and can be truncated to just two states : its ground and first excited state , and therefore behaves like the two - state impurity atom in our model .",
    "the fact that at a phase transition quantum fluctuations become important but that this point also coincides with the onset of chaos , which is a classical phenomenon , suggests intriguing connections between the quantum and classical worlds @xcite .",
    "the layout of this paper is as follows : we introduce the boson - impurity and the dicke hamiltonians in section [ sec : model ] ; sec .",
    "[ sec : sa ] consists of an analysis of the stationary mean - field problem including loops and the stability of the solutions ; in sec .",
    "[ sec : mfc ] we show the emergence of classical chaos which is triggered by the bifurcation and hence the presence of the impurity ; the following sec .  [ sec : selft ] demonstrates self - trapping , and in sec .",
    "[ sec : ls ] we analyze the nearest neighbour statistics of the quantum energy levels which further illustrates that chaos is to be expected in the classical limit .",
    "we have also provided two appendices : appendix [ sec : appendixparity ] explains how we ensure that the eigenstates produced by numerical diagonalization have well defined parity and appendix [ sec : app ] contains poincar sections through classical phase space that illustrate how the dynamics changes as we sample different energies .",
    "within the two - site single band bose - hubbard model , i.e.  the two mode model , the many - body hamiltonian for the boson - impurity system is given by @xcite @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the number difference operator between the two wells for the bosons , and @xmath6 is the boson hopping operator which also gives the coherence between the two wells @xcite .",
    "likewise , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the equivalent operators for the impurity .",
    "we assume that both the boson and impurity creation / annihilation operators obey the standard bosonic commutation relations , i.e.  @xmath9=[\\hat{a}_\\alpha,\\hat{a}_\\alpha^\\dagger]=1 $ ] with @xmath10 and all the remaining commutators are identically zero .",
    "however , because there is only one impurity its statistics do not matter and it could be a boson or a fermion . @xmath11",
    "parameterizes the boson - impurity interaction , and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the hopping amplitudes for the bosons and impurity , respectively . using similar notation , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the respective differences between the zero - point energies of the two wells , i.e.  the tilt , for the bosons and the impurity .",
    "it is important to appreciate that we do not include direct boson - boson interactions in our model , assuming that they can be removed by a feshbach resonance if necessary @xcite . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we did include them , but for many of the effects we are interested in here , especially the bifurcation in the ground state , they are a distraction that does not make a qualitative difference to the behavior . one exception to this is the particular case of attractive boson - boson interactions above a certain threshold in which case they also cause a symmetry breaking bifurcation in the ground state as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the hamiltonian in equation ( [ eq : mbham ] ) can be re - expressed in a spin notation by using the symmetric / antisymmetric ( s / as ) modes instead of the left / right ( l / r ) modes as a basis .",
    "the s / as modes are the eigenmodes of the single particle problem , i.e.  in the absence of interactions .",
    "therefore , in the limit that @xmath16 the ground state corresponds to all the particles in the s mode because it has lower energy . using a simple hadamard - rotation of the l / r creation ( annihilation ) operators we have , @xmath17 and similar expressions hold for the impurity operators . in the new basis , and for vanishing tilts @xmath18 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbham ] ) takes the form @xmath19 where the schwinger spin - representation has been used  @xcite , i.e.  @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "apart from the trivial @xmath22 symmetry related to particle conservation , we note that the hamiltonian supports a @xmath23 parity symmetry under @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and equivalently for the impurity spin operators .",
    "this spin rotation preserves the @xmath27 angular momentum commutation relations .",
    "note that in the original l / r - basis this symmetry is nothing but a reflection of the double - well about the origin .",
    "it follows that a non - zero tilt @xmath28 or @xmath29 breaks this symmetry .    as claimed in the introduction , our model hamiltonian in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallham ] ) shows some resemblance to the dicke hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath30 here , @xmath31 are photon , i.e.  boson , creation ( annihilation ) operators and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are spin operators .",
    "( [ eq : dicke ] ) describes a spin-@xmath34 system coupled to the position coordinate of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the frequencies @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the spin precession and harmonic oscillator frequencies , respectively , and @xmath37 is the coupling strength .",
    "this system experiences a qpt at a certain critical value @xmath38 which will be discussed further below  @xcite . by comparison , eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallham ] ) can now be thought of as a system consisting of a spin-@xmath34 coupled to a spin-1/2 particle ( impurity ) instead of a harmonic oscillator ( dicke model ) .",
    "here lies the most important distinction between the two hamiltonians : in the dicke model the coupling is to the electromagnetic field which has infinitely many energy levels whereas there are only two levels for the impurity . despite this truncation of the hilbert space of the dicke model",
    ", the parity symmetry of the boson - impurity model has its analogue in the dicke model with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "these similarities mean that the boson - impurity system behaves as a simplified , or poor man s , dicke model that captures the crucial behaviour near the qpt .",
    "we also note that the rotating - wave approximation has not been imposed , either in eq .",
    "( [ eq : smallham ] ) or in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dicke ] ) .    in order to obtain many of the results presented in this paper we numerically diagonalize the hamiltonian given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbham ] ) . for @xmath0 atoms",
    "this requires diagonalizing a @xmath41 matrix which is tractable for @xmath42 on a small computer because of the linear scaling in @xmath0 of the matrix dimension and thus we can obtain numerically exact results .",
    "there are , however , some subtleties involved which are reflected in the physics of the system : from the above discussion we see that in the absence of any tilt the eigenstates should all have well defined parity in the two - dimensional fock space ( i.e.  number difference space ) where the many - body quantum state lives . however , numerical diagonalization routines do not automatically respect this parity symmetry .",
    "the most severe test occurs in the critical region where the quantum state becomes non - gaussian and eventually evolves into a schrdinger cat state made of two almost separated pieces in fock space connected only by exponentially small probability amplitudes in between .",
    "this may be viewed as arising from the appearance of an effective double well potential in fock space : for each even parity state there is an odd parity one and their energies become almost degenerate except for an exponentially small tunnel splitting when they lie below the barrier top .",
    "numerical routines find it hard to handle exponentially small numbers at the same time as numbers of order unity and tend to give eigenstates of broken parity above the critical value of @xmath11 , i.e.  the eigenstates choose one well or the other .",
    "it is amusing to reflect on the fact that numerical errors replicate the effects of a physical environment ! as we explain in appendix [ sec : appendixparity ] , we circumvent these problems by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in a basis which has well defined parity so that good parity in fock space is built in from the start .    )",

    "going from left to right each plot shows an increase in the energy shell by @xmath170 which is one tenth of the range for @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 is held constant at @xmath173 , so we are always in the chaotic regime .",
    "the region of phase space accessible to the bosons is restricted whereas the impurity can access its entire phase space .",
    "this is due to the small impurity hopping energy , @xmath13 , relative to @xmath174 .",
    "the bosons can be thought of as a reservoir of energy , whose dynamic behaviour on a global scale is barely affected by the impurity",
    ". however , locally the dynamics take place in a band whose thickness depends on @xmath13 ; within the band there is chaos .    in the bottom",
    "two rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : ppanel22 ] we see that the dynamics of the impurity get less chaotic , up to a point , as the energy shell is increased , then become more chaotic again .",
    "to explain this we note that the top loop in fig .  [",
    "fig : evtilt ] forms from a supercritical bifurcation when @xmath175 ( the top loop would form sooner for @xmath176 ) , so both loops are symmetric in that regard .",
    "this is why we get a symmetric degree of chaos around the plot that corresponds to @xmath177 ( bottom plot ( f ) ) .",
    "the location in phase space of the second unstable point is @xmath178 .",
    "top plot ( f ) shows the dynamics of the bosons when @xmath177 .",
    "we see that when @xmath85 or @xmath179 , @xmath70 and when @xmath180 , @xmath181 , so the bosons are always at a maximal distance from the unstable points in phase space .",
    "when we increase @xmath182 further we see the dynamics converge to regions around @xmath183 which causes an increase in chaotic behaviour of the impurity .",
    "the important point to make here is that for our parameters the energy needed by the impurity to access all of its phase space is small compared to the energy of the entire system .",
    "this means that the impurity has access to the regions around @xmath184 .",
    "therefore , the degree of chaos of the impurity dynamics depends on how close the bosons are to @xmath185"
