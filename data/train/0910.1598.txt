    "are now carried out routinely by several groups , and while we await new advances in combining radiative transfer with sph merger and cosmological simulations @xcite , simple comparisons can be already be made . for a suite of 79 merger simulations presented in @xcite we used standard stellar population synthesis , dust attenuation law and balmer emission predictions to recreate the `` observed '' spectra of the merging galaxies .    in figure 1",
