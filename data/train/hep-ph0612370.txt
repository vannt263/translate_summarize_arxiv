    "the measurement of the lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) in charged lepton sector is one of the most important measurements to search for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "since the neutrino oscillations have been observed , the charged lfv processes can be expected to be non - vanishing .",
    "however , the sm with the majorana neutrino masses leads too small lfv decay rates to be observed due to smallness of the neutrino masses@xcite .",
    "thus , detections of the lfv processes means discovery of new physics .",
    "in fact the supersymmetric extension of the sm leads generically large lfv decay rates , because of picking up the off - diagonal entries of slepton mass matrices ( in substitution for neutrinos ) in intermediate state .",
    "however , it is well known that flavor changing neutral current ( fcnc ) and cp violating processes are highly suppressed experimentally .",
    "they impose severe constraints on the minimal supersymmetric ( susy ) standard model ( mssm ) parameter space@xcite .",
    "the simplest way to satisfy these fcnc constraints is to adopt the universal sfermion soft mass matrices at some scale .    in many analysis that have been done so far , the universal soft masses at the gravitational scale or at the grand unified scale have been assumed and the lfv decay rates are calculated by the non - universality which is induced by the radiative correction@xcite . for example , in the mssm with the majorana neutrino masses , the radiative correction induces the non - universal sfermion masses@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is difficult to predict the lfv decay rates quantitatively in this scenario unless the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are fixed , because such lfv decay rates strongly depend on the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings , which looks impossible to be measured directly . in @xmath7",
    "grand unified theory ( gut ) , the dirac neutrino yukawa couplings are related with the up - type quark yukawa couplings .",
    "then we can predict the lfv decay rates@xcite , but they are too large to be consistent with the experimental bound if the diagonalizing matrix of the fermions mass matrices for doublet lepton has the maki - nakagawa - sakata@xcite(mns)-_like _ large mixings . in this direction , some special structure which suppresses the @xmath8 process is required .",
    "the assumption of universal soft masses is not necessarily required .",
    "for example , since the fcnc constraints for the first two generation fields are much more severe than for the third generation fields , the universal soft masses sometimes have been imposed only for the first two generation sfermion , which are realized if we impose non - abelian horizontal symmetry , for example , @xmath9 , under which the first two generation fields are doublets and the third generation fields are singlets@xcite .",
    "however , if the diagonalizing matrix of the fermions have the mns-_like _ large mixings , such sfermion mass spectrum leads to too large fcnc to be consistent with the experimental bound .",
    "therefore , such non - universality must be introduced only for the sfermion whose fermionic superpartner has the diagonalizing matrix with the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa@xcite(ckm)-_like _ small mixings .    in the su(5 ) susy - gut , it is a reasonable assumption that the diagonalizing matrices of @xmath10 representation fields have the ckm-_like _ small mixings , while those of @xmath11 fields have the mns-_like _ large mixings , because @xmath10 representation includes the doublet quarks , and @xmath11 includes the doublet leptons . under this assumption , only the third generation sfermions of the @xmath10 representation can have different masses from the others without contradicting with experimental constraints from various fcnc processes . in this paper ,",
    "we study the lfv under the non - universal sfermion masses above .    before examining the lfv",
    ", we summarize several characteristic features of the non - universal sfermion masses .",
    "first of all , the rotation matrix for @xmath12 which makes fermions to mass eigenstate is expected to have the ckm-_like _ small mixings , since @xmath12 involves quark doublet .",
    "therefore , large off - diagonal entries for @xmath12 representation sfermion mass matrix do not arise after this rotation , even if the initial soft masses are not degenerate .",
    "moreover , fcnc constraints among 1 - 3 or 2 - 3 generations are not so severe than that of 1 - 2 generations .",
    "therefore , we can expect that non - degeneracy for third generation does not conflict the fcnc constraints . and it is important that we can expect larger fcnc for the third generation fields than in the usual universal sfermion mass case .",
    "second , the naturalness of the higgs mass in mssm requires that the gaugino masses , the higgsino mass , and the stop masses must be around the weak scale . in the above non - universality case",
    ", we can take the larger masses for the other sfermion masses than the third generation sfermions of the @xmath10 representation without conflicting the naturalness arguments , because the both stops ( left and right handed stops ) are included in the third generation @xmath10 representation of @xmath13 . in principle , we can take such mass larger than 1 tev , which can weaken the various constraints from fcnc , electric dipole moments ( edm ) and the muon @xmath14 , etc",
    ". related with the first two generation fields .",
    "again , the fcnc related with the third generation fields can become relatively large , which may be detectable in future experiments .",
    "finally , such non - universality of the sfermion masses is naturally realized in the @xmath15 susy - gut model@xcite with @xmath16 or @xmath17 horizontal symmetry@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we will analyze the lepton flavor violating @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes under this non - universal sfermion masses .",
    "the point is that the naturalness requires that the @xmath18 sfermion masses are @xmath19 , i.e. , the right - handed stau mass becomes @xmath19 .",
    "we show that if mass of right - handed stau is near the weak scale , each lfv decay rate becomes sufficiently large to be found by near future experiments . actually , the lfv decay rates are very sensitive to the right - handed stau mass . thus ,",
    "if @xmath0 or @xmath1 processes are discovered and the branching ratios are measured , this model may predict a mass of right - handed stau .",
    "we will see that this model has interesting feature , that is , this model indicates that the final state charged lepton tends to be right - handed , since main source of flavor violation comes from the feynman diagram which includes the right - handed charged slepton .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will specify the model , and discuss how lepton flavor violating processes take place in this model .",
    "the results of our numerical study are given in section 3 . in section 4 , we will give a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in this section , we discuss how lepton flavor violating decays take place in a susy - gut model with the non - universal sfermion masses mentioned in the previous section .",
    "first , we assume that the sm gauge group @xmath20 is unified into @xmath13 .",
    "( note that the following arguments can be applied to unified models with larger unified gauge groups , for instance , @xmath7 or @xmath3 . ) then , around the gut scale , the lagrangian for the susy breaking terms is given as @xmath21 where the tilded fields are regarded as sfermions , @xmath22 is su(5 ) gauginos , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 is su(5 ) gaugino mass , and @xmath28 gives sfermions and higgs soft mass terms .",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 include the down - type higgs @xmath31 and the up - type higgs @xmath32 , respectively .    as mentioned in introduction",
    ", we consider following forms for the sfermion mass matrices . @xmath33",
    "the reasons are as follows :    * * severe constraints on the first two generation : * + there are severe constraints on the off - diagonal entries of low energy sfermion mass matrices from the various fcnc processes in the basis of the superfields in which all quark and lepton mass matrices are diagonal ( super - ckm basis ) .",
    "this is famous as the susy - flavor problem . in particular ,",
    "the ( 1,2 ) component suffers from strong constraints by cp violating parameters of @xmath34-@xmath35 mixing , lepton flavor violating @xmath1 , and so on .",
    "thus , we can not release degeneracy between 1 - 2 generation , otherwise a large ( 1,2 ) element arises in super - ckm basis and it conflicts with experiments . * * large neutrino mixing and constraints on 2 - 3 generation : * + it is known that there is a maximal mixing between 2 - 3 generation in lepton sector@xcite .",
    "this large mixing sometimes is related with the mixing of @xmath36 since @xmath36 contains left - handed lepton doublet .",
    "thus , if we release degeneracy between 2 - 3 generations in @xmath36 , a large 2 - 3 component of @xmath37 is generated in super - ckm basis .",
    "it conflicts with constraints from @xmath38-@xmath39 mixing and @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we should assume degeneracy of 2 - 3 generation for @xmath37 soft masses .",
    "while , we can take a soft mass of the third generation of @xmath40 different from that of the other generation , since a mixing of @xmath12 is expected to be as small as ckm mixing .",
    "* * naturalness of the mssm : * + in the mssm , there is no terrible fine tuning problem due to supersymmetric cancellation for quadratic divergence for radiative correction to higgs mass square . instead of the quadratic divergence ,",
    "the radiative corrections are proportional to the susy breaking mass square , and therefore susy breaking mass scale must be around the weak scale @xmath41 to avoid some tuning if the couplings are @xmath42 . among the various sfermion masses ,",
    "only the stop masses must be the weak scale , while the other sfermion masses can be taken much larger than the weak scale because of the smallness of the yukawa couplings .",
    "one of the advantages of the mass spectrum we assumed is that we can take all the sfermion masses much larger than the weak scale except the masses of sfermions which are contained in @xmath18 . in such parameter region ,",
    "several constraints in susy models , for example @xmath14 , edm , fcnc , etc , are relaxed without loss of naturalness .",
    "especially , a - term contribution to edm or fcnc for the first two generations can be decoupled in this region . in the literature",
    ", it is argued that the stop masses are required to be larger than the weak scale to realize the higgs mass larger than the lower bound @xmath43 gev obtained at lep ii .",
    "such large stop masses lead to some tuning in the higgs sector .",
    "this is called  the little hierarchy problem\"@xcite .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , the stop masses around 300 - 400 gev can be consistent with the lep ii experiments , if the lightest cp - even higgs has a small @xmath44 coupling .",
    "therefore , some of the parameter region considered in this paper may lead to such small stop masses , but it is consistent with the lep ii results of the higgs search experiment . *",
    "* @xmath3 gut with u(2 ) horizontal symmetry : * + introducing a non - abelian horizontal symmetry is one of various interesting possibilities to realize the flavor blind nature of the sfermion masses@xcite .",
    "most of the previous attempts adopt u(2 ) or su(2)@xmath45 u(1 ) symmetry as the horizontal symmetry@xcite , which realize the universality of the first two generation sfermion masses and the large top yukawa coupling , if we assign doublets for the first two generation fields and singlets for the third generation fields and the higgs fields .",
    "unfortunately , the universality of the first two generation fields is not sufficient to suppress the fcnc constraints especially when the diagonalizing matrix of fermion mass matrices have the mns-_like _ large mixings as we pointed out in the previous section .",
    "@xmath3 gut @xmath45 u(2 ) horizontal symmetry model@xcite succeeds to give not only the observing large hierarchy of fermion masses but also the sufficient universality of the sfermion masses to avoid fcnc or edm constraints in a simple way even when the diagonalizing matrix has the mns-_like _ large mixings .",
    "it is essential that this model can naturally realize the sfermion mass spectrum which we discussed in this paper because of an @xmath3 nature .",
    "the superpotential is given at the gut scale as follows .",
    "@xmath46 since * 10 * contains left - handed quark doublet , the diagonalizing matrices of * 10 * fields are naively expected as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is cabibbo angle @xmath49 and we omit the @xmath50 coefficients .",
    "this rotation generates off - diagonal entries of the sfermion masses of @xmath10 fields as @xmath51 @xmath52 at the gut scale .    in the following ,",
    "we examine the lfv processes with the above sfermion masses .",
    "we use the mass insertion method to estimate the amplitudes for a while . as the slepton",
    "mass matrices at the susy breaking scale , we adopt the slepton mass matrices given by replacing the @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 with @xmath56 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , respectively , which are the slepton mass parameters at the susy breaking scale .",
    "as mensioned in introduction , we neglect the radiatively induced off - diagonal slepton mass matrices .",
    "the weak scale stability requires that @xmath59 , @xmath27 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 must be around the weak scale , but the other parameters , for example , @xmath56 , can be much larger than the weak scale . in this paper",
    ", we often take @xmath59 , @xmath27 , @xmath60 , @xmath62 . for the left - right mixing susy breaking parameters , @xmath61",
    ", we just neglect the contributions in this paper .",
    "one reason is that this contributions are decoupled in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath27 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 , and the other reason is that we would like to examine the model independent parts while the left - right mixing susy breaking parameters are strongly dependent on the explicit models . on the other hand , the diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) are not decoupled because @xmath64 becomes large in the limit",
    "therefore , we consider only ( a ) and ( b ) for a while .",
    "cc            when @xmath65 is large , the diagram ( b ) which is proportional to @xmath66 is significant , where @xmath67 gev .",
    "the ratio of ( b ) and ( a ) is roughly @xmath68 + let us roughly estimate the branching ratio of @xmath1 from the diagram ( b ) which is expected to give the largest contribution . comparing the diagram for @xmath1 with that for @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) , we can roughly estimate the @xmath1 branching ratio as @xmath71 + where @xmath72 is fermi constant and @xmath73 is typical superparticle mass .",
    "for example , if we take @xmath74gev ,  @xmath75 , ( [ branch(m ) ] ) is found as @xmath76 we find that it is as large as the experimental upper bound ( @xmath77@xcite ) . since there is no lepton mass dependence in equation ( [ branch(m ) ] ) , it can be applied for the @xmath0 branching ratio . substituting @xmath78 and @xmath79 for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively ,",
    "the @xmath0 branching ratio is found roughly as @xmath82 then , for the same @xmath73 and @xmath65 as in the above estimation of @xmath83 , @xmath84 the branching ratio of @xmath0 is also as large as reach of experimental bound ( @xmath85@xcite ) .",
    "the relation between @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) , @xmath88 is also an interesting prediction of this scenario .",
    "unfortunately @xmath89 process is more difficult to be observed because of the small branching ratio because the experimental bound , @xmath90@xcite , is similar to that of @xmath91 process .",
    "since the above estimations are very rough , more accurate calculations are necessary .",
    "such accurate calculations and the results are given in the next section .    before going to the numerical calculations , we mention about the other source of lfv .",
    "it has been discussed that the loop corrections induce the off - diagonal elements of left - handed slepton soft masses@xcite as @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the right - handed neutrino mass scale and the mediation scale of susy breaking , respectively .",
    "if @xmath95 then this loop correction may become sizable .",
    "for example , in so(10 ) gut model with minimal higgs sector above equality is just hold because of so(10 ) gut relation @xmath96 , though not in @xmath3 models due to the smaller dirac neutrino yukawa couplings .",
    "since these contributions are decoupled again in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath27 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 , we neglect this effect in this paper .    in case",
    "where @xmath97 have non - vanishing off - diagonal elements in the @xmath98 diagonal basis , it leads large lfv .",
    "the lfv occurs through the diagram ( c ) .",
    "cc            the ratio of amplitudes of diagram ( c ) and that of ( b ) is roughly found as @xmath99 if @xmath100 is hold , a contribution from diagram(c ) is more significant than ( b ) .",
    "as we noted , this contribution is dependent on the explicit models and decoupled in the limit @xmath59 , @xmath27 , @xmath60 , @xmath63 , and therefore , we just neglect this effect in this paper .",
    "when the a - terms are proportional to relevant yukawa matrices ( @xmath101 ) or even when the a - term is vanishing , the double - mass insertion diagram ( d ) via @xmath60 parameter can contribute the lfv processes .",
    "this contribution is included in our calculation in the next section , but it is small",
    ". this may be because it is decoupled in the above limit and it is vanishing when @xmath102 .",
    "let us discuss the branching ratio of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath105 is written as @xmath106 where @xmath107 and @xmath108 represent the momenta of @xmath109 and photon , respectively . ignoring a mass of @xmath110 the decay rate",
    "is given by @xmath111 now we can see an interesting feature in this model .",
    "this model says final state lepton tends to have the right - handed chirality . from the operator form ( [ operator ] )",
    ", we find that chirality flip is necessary with picking up the yukawa couplings . in this model ,",
    "only flavor violating coupling in the charged lepton sector is @xmath112 .",
    "so , the intermediate state must have the right - handed chirality .",
    "if the final state lepton has the left - handed chirality , we must pick up the yukawa couplings at the final vertex ( @xmath113 ) . on the other hand , if the final state has the right - handed chirality ( then the initial state has the left - handed chirality ) we must pick up that at the initial vertex ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "it means @xmath115 is as large as @xmath116 times @xmath117 , so we find the final state lepton tends to have the right - handed chirality .",
    "we can test this prediction experimentally by measuring the angular distribution of final lepton .    in the basis where the charged slepton and the neutralino are mass eigenstates ,",
    "the amplitude of @xmath105 is given by @xmath118\\ , ,   \\label{masseigenamp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 @xmath122 denote the masses of the charged slepton and the neutralino masses , respectively .",
    "@xmath123 and @xmath124 are the effective couplings which originate with the gauge interaction and yukawa interaction , respectively .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath123 and @xmath124 and the function @xmath125 are defined in appendix .",
    "we assume the gut relation for gaugino masses@xmath126 moreover , we use the observed ckm matrix as the form of unitary matrix for @xmath127 which diagonalizes @xmath128 .",
    "coefficients can be large as discussed in the previous section",
    ". we also neglect a suppression factor ( @xmath129 ) induced by electromagnetic corrections@xcite . ] here , only for simplicity , we take the vanishing cp phase . in the above assumption ,",
    "the number of free parameters which determine the branching ratios is 5 : @xmath56 , @xmath57 , the higgsino mixing parameter ( @xmath60 ) , the @xmath130 gaugino mass ( @xmath131 ) , and the higgs vev ratio ( @xmath132 ) . in the following , instead of",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 , we use the first two generation right - handed slepton masses defined as @xmath133 and the right - handed stau mass defined as @xmath134 , which give the eigenvalues of the slepton mass matrix in the limit in which the lepton yukawa couplings are vanishing .    in fig.1",
    ", we show the dependence of @xmath135 on the first two generation right - handed slepton mass . here",
    ", we take @xmath136 @xmath137 . the sign of @xmath60 is taken so that the chargino contribution to the @xmath138 process has the opposite sign for the sm contribution .     and @xmath83 on @xmath139,width=362 ]     and @xmath83 on @xmath139,width=366 ]",
    "we can see that the branching ratios become zero at the point where @xmath139 is 150 gev .",
    "this is because the flavor violating source ( @xmath112 ) is vanished , since right - handed slepton masses are universal .",
    "since we do not take account of the slepton lr mixing or the radiatively induced flavor violating source in this paper , it seems that their contributions dominate actually at this region . on the other hand , as we can see in fig.1",
    ", both branching ratios are not vanishing in the limit @xmath140 .",
    "let us explain the reason , using the mass insertion method .",
    "both @xmath103 and @xmath104 diagrams ( a ) and ( b ) include the first or the second generation right - handed slepton in the loop",
    ". however , in the limit @xmath140 , the internal lines can be estimated as +    cr        @xmath141    for @xmath0 , +    cr        @xmath142    cr        @xmath143     +   + for @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath140 , the flavor changing off - diagonal entries become also large . as a result , both transition rates remain finite . from fig.1 ,",
    "the branching ratios no longer depend on the first two generation masses in @xmath144 gev region .    in figs.2 and 4",
    ", we show the @xmath60 dependence of @xmath145 and @xmath146 . here , we take @xmath147 gev and the other parameters are taken as in the previous one .",
    "we find that around @xmath148 gev the branching ratios become very small . to understand this behavior , we should remind that neutralino amplitude consists of two parts .",
    "one is proportional to @xmath149 , the other is proportional to @xmath121 , they correspond to diagram ( a ) and diagram ( b ) , respectively . in figs.3 and 5",
    ", the dotted line represents the amplitude which are proportional to @xmath150 and the solid line represents the amplitude which is proportional to @xmath121 .",
    "as we can see from these figures , the @xmath150 part depends hardly on @xmath60 .",
    "this is because this part comes mainly from the diagram ( a ) in which higssinos do not contribute . on the other hand , the @xmath121 part which comes mainly from the diagram ( b ) depends on @xmath60 .",
    "this part changes its sign from @xmath151 to @xmath152 and is decreasing as increasing @xmath60 due to the decoupling . basically , contribution of diagram ( b ) is larger than that of diagram ( a ) due to @xmath132 enhancement .",
    "however , when diagram ( b ) changes its sign , or it goes to decouple as increasing @xmath153 , there are two points where the magnitude of diagram ( b ) becomes smaller than that of diagram ( a ) .",
    "if each diagrams have different sign in these points , they are cancelled .",
    "now , we could understand the vanishing point in figs.2 and 4 .",
    "note that the cancellation happens mainly in the @xmath151 region .",

    "we have considered a situation where @xmath57 is of order the weak scale while @xmath56 is larger than the weak scale . in this case , the lfv decay rates are determined mainly by the right - handed stau mass and @xmath132 . especially , the branching ratios of @xmath103 and @xmath104 strongly depend on the right - handed stau mass .",
    "this means that this type of soft mass matrix can be tested by checking the relation among the lfv decay rates and the right - handed stau mass which may be measured in the direct search , though the ambiguity due to the @xmath50 coefficients still exists .",
    "as we can see from figs.7 and 8 , if the right - handed stau is lighter than 420 gev ( when @xmath4 ) , @xmath104 process may be discovered at the meg experiment .",
    "it may be interesting that the b - factory can find the @xmath174 events before the meg experiment find the @xmath175 events because the present constraints from @xmath174 is more severe than that from the @xmath175 process .",
    "moreover , this model provides some interesting predictions .",
    "first , this model says that the final state lepton tends to have the right - handed chirality , because the intermediate state must have the right - handed chirality to pick up the flavor violating mass matrix entries . on the other hand ,",
    "the lfv processes induced radiatively via large dirac neutrino yukawa interactions predicts an opposite chirality ( left - handed ) for the final state lepton .",
    "this difference can be checked by measuring the angular distribution of the final lepton for the initial lepton s spin .",
    "second , this model predicts several relations among @xmath103 , @xmath104 , and @xmath180 as @xmath181 ^ 4 br(\\mu\\to e\\gamma)\\sim 20\\times [ { \\cal o}(1)]^4 br(\\tau \\to e \\gamma)$ ] .",
    "this enhancement factor of the former relation can be understood as @xmath182 and that of the latter as @xmath183 .",
    "it is important to test these predictions in future experiments .",

    "the work of t.y . is supported by the 21st century coe program of nagoya university .",
    "in this appendix , we give our notation and conventions adopted in section 3 , which are basically the same as in the papers @xcite .",
    "first we consider the sfermions . below the weak scale ,",
    "the mass matrix of the charged slepton is given in the super - ckm basis as @xmath184 @xmath185 where @xmath186 and @xmath187 are slepton soft mass matrices given in eq .",

    "( [ v10 ] ) , and @xmath189 is the diagonal charged lepton mass matrix .",
