    "b[e ] stars are enigmatic objects . their optical spectra show strong balmer emission lines as well as permitted and forbidden emission lines of lowly - ionized metals . in addition , b[e ] stars display a near- and mid - infrared excess that is attributed to hot and warm circumstellar dust . however , because the definition of the b[e ] class is purely morphological , it contains objects that are physically very different in terms of their initial mass and evolutionary phase : b[e ] supergiants ( b[e]sgs ) , herbig aebe ( haebe ) stars , compact planetary nebulae , and symbiotic objects ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "especially b[e]sgs and haebe stars are difficult to distinguish ; they have dense , cool , and dusty equatorial disks , which are related to either accretion and disk winds ( in the case of haebe stars ) or equatorially enhanced stellar winds ( b[e]sgs ) .",
    "these disks give rise to molecular emission such as the first overtone bands of carbon monoxide ( co ) in the near - infrared which are observed in both haebe stars and b[e]sgs @xcite . in addition , the position of haebe stars in the empirical hertzsprung - russell diagram overlaps with that of the low - luminosity b[e]sgs .",
    "so far , comprehensive studies of b[e ] stars , focused on the spectral classification and characterization , were mostly based on optical spectra . over the last two decades new instruments",
    "have given access to the infrared ( ir ) spectral range and allowed high - quality spectra with the necessary spectral resolution to be obtained .",
    "but only now projects are checking systematically how appropriate spectral classification based on ir spectra alone is for general application purposes .",
    "for example , @xcite find that based on @xmath0-band spectra three distinct groups of stars can be identified : ( 1 ) `` regular '' b[e]sgs with the expected spectrum of emission lines including the pfund series and co in emission , ( 2 ) sdor - like luminous blue variables ( lbvs ) with a variety of strong emission lines but lacking the expected circumstellar co emission , and ( 3 ) a group of cool stars , consisting of lbvs in outburst and yellow hypergiants ( yhgs ) , showing the pfund series in absorption .",
    "the co bands can be used to obtain an age estimate for a star . as proposed by @xcite , stellar evolution models with rotation",
    "predict the enhancement of the carbon isotope @xmath2c on the stellar surface during the core - hydrogen burning of massive stars through mixing . via mass loss",
    ", it is transported into the circumstellar environments and locked into @xmath2co molecules .",
    "hence , in evolved stars ( i.e. , supergiants ) , the enriched isotope should become detectable as @xmath2co bands .",
    "this was confirmed by detection of @xmath2co emission in known , extra - galactic b[e]sgs @xcite ; vice versa the @xmath2co absorption can be used to distinguish late - type supergiants from dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "we have embarked on a mini - survey of a sample of galactic b[e ] stars to investigate their evolutionary status and characterize their age and circumstellar material from @xmath0-band spectra .",
    "we present our observations in sect.[sec : obs ] with the results of the spectral analysis following in sect.[sec : results ] .",
    "the final part of the paper is dedicated to the discussion and conclusion of our findings ( sects.[sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusion ] ) .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite classified the star as spectral type b0-b2 , finding its emission - line spectrum typical for a b[e]sg .",
    "the authors refer to the star as an atypical high - mass x - ray binary but speculations about the existence and nature of the compact companion are ongoing .",
    "@xcite describe the star as x - ray binary/ x - ray transient radio source , and detect a slow , decelerating shell in radio emission .",
    "however , the nature of this emission is also still under debate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , a faint circumstellar shell has been detected by @xcite , but the authors find no clear evidence to determine whether this is stellar ejecta or the illuminated local interstellar material .",
    "the analysis of spectral line profiles , the derived extinction , and interferometric observations suggest that mwc84 has an equatorial disk wind with a dust - free high - temperature zone close to the star , and that it is viewed almost pole - on ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the latter authors revised the distance estimate based on @xmath3 measurements and interstellar d - lines , to about 2.2kpc , placing the star in the perseus arm ; with that distance , an upper - limit luminosity of @xmath4 is derived .",
    "other studies find both smaller ( @xmath5kpc by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath6kpc ) and larger ( e.g. @xmath7kpc * ? ? ?",
    "* ) distances , hampering reliable estimates of the luminosity .",
    "@xcite present @xmath8 and @xmath0-band spectra obtained one month after the outburst that are rich in hydrogen , helium and iron emission lines and clearly show lines of the pfund series and the presence of co emission in the @xmath0-band .",
    "the authors argue that the molecular emission likely arises due to collisional excitation from regions shielded from the stellar radiation , which requires high densities .",

    "* covering 1998 to 2006 ) have supported the scenario of a stable circumstellar disk in the last decade .",
    "our spectra ( see fig.[fig : mwc084-co ] ) do not show any indication of pfund lines or co emission or absorption , neither in 2010 ( lbt - lucii ) nor in 2011 or 2013 ( both gemini - gnirs ) .",
    "we attribute this disappearance of pfund and co emission to the loss / dilution of the high - density circumstellar material and the return of mwc84 to its pre - outburst stage .      for both mwc623 and as381 , it has been suggested that the stars are in binary systems with a cool companion .",
    "our finding of prominent co absorption bands supports this position and we determined the spectral types for the companions from the co band head equivalent widths , see sect.[sec : results ] and table[tab : linelist ] .",
    "[ [ mwc-623 ] ] mwc 623 + + + + + + +    based on the detection of a set of early - type ( emission ) and late - type ( absorption ) optical lines , @xcite conclude that mwc623 is a spectroscopic binary ( sb2 ) of type b2+k2 .",
    "however , they find no indication for @xmath3 variations , attributing this to a binary period longer than covered by their range of observational data of 2years .",
    "@xcite reclassifies the spectral types of the binary components to b4iii+k2ii - ib but no periodic @xmath3 variations are found even in long - time observations @xcite .",
    "this might indicate a pole - on orientation of the system , e.g. @xcite .",
    "based on the k star s luminosity class , @xcite derives a spectroscopic distance of @xmath10kpc .",
    "our derived spectral type of the cool component is a slightly cooler k4i - ii star , but with the same range for the luminosity class .",
    "we take mwc623 s 2mass magnitude @xmath11mag and assume that the @xmath0-band emission is dominated by the cool companion . with the distance and reddening as listed in table[tab : starparameters ] , and bolometric corrections determined following @xcite , we derive the companion s luminosity as @xmath12 .",
    "assuming that mwc623 is a physical long - period binary and not a chance superposition detected in the spectrum , each component in all likelihood has evolved like a single star . from comparison with the stellar - evolution track of 7@xmath13 initial mass ( see fig.[fig : hrd - companions ] ) , we find an age difference of 1.8myr of the components .",
    "this seems negligible compared to the total age of the system of about 50myr .",
    "[ [ as381 ] ] as381 + + + + +    the star was first listed in the h@xmath14 surveys by @xcite and @xcite as emission - line star ; @xcite classify it as be star with ir excess .",
    "@xcite detected absorption lines of neutral metals in their near - ir spectra and @xmath15co absorption bands , concluding that the star is a b1 + k binary system .",
    "the authors also derive a lower limit for the orbital period of @xmath16d .",
    "they estimate the distance to be @xmath17kpc deriving luminosities of @xmath18 and @xmath19 for the b and k component , respectively .",
    "in addition , the authors claim to find signs of ongoing mass transfer between the binary components .",
    "@xcite lists an effective temperature of @xmath20 for the b star and an interstellar reddening of @xmath21mag .    as described in sect.[sec : results ] , we derive a spectral type of k0 for the companion from the equivalent width measured for the first @xmath15co bandhead . however , the determination of the luminosity class is not that unambiguous , as a clear detection of @xmath2co is not confirmed .",
    "assuming that the flux in the infrared - wavelength range is dominated by the cool companion , we use the mean @xmath0-band magnitude of those listed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "table2 ) , @xmath22mag , to derive the companion s luminosity .",
    "including the distance and reddening as listed in table[tab : starparameters ] , and the bolometric corrections for the @xmath0-band according to @xcite , we obtain @xmath23 . within the errors ,",
    "this result is robust enough to allow up to 25% of the @xmath0-band flux to be contributed from the b - type companion .    according to the stellar evolution tracks in fig.[fig : hrd - companions ] , we determine lower - limit initial masses of about 16@xmath13 and 10@xmath13 , and ages of about 13myr and 25myr for the b - type and k - type star , respectively .",
    "fig.[fig : hrd - companions ] also suggests that the b component of as381 , although more massive , seems to be less evolved than the k companion .",
    "given the short lower - limit orbital period of the system , it seems possible to consider that mass transfer might have happened at some stage of the evolution of this binary star . in that case single - star stellar evolution models are of course not adequate for mass and age determination .",
    "we conducted a mini - survey of galactic b[e ] stars with the lbt - lucii and gemini - gnirs to characterize their near - infrared @xmath0-band spectra .",
    "the most dominant emission line feature detected is the br@xmath1 line that is present in all our sample stars . in many cases ,",
    "iron and magnesium emission can be identified , while helium and sodium emission lines are less common .",
    "in addition , the detection and analysis of molecular lines like from carbon monoxide is a very helpful and powerful tool for the classification of the stars and their circumstellar material , or for the confirmation of a cool companion respectively .    summarizing the results of our b[e ] survey :    1 .",
    "mwc314 shows a spectrum rich in lines of hydrogen , including pronounced lines of the pfund series .",
    "several lines of sodium , magnesium , and iron are present as well .",
    "only a weak ir excess is detected and co emission is lacking at all .",
    "the @xmath0-band spectrum of mwc314 strongly resembles the ones of lbv stars and candidates , e.g.  sdor and lha120-s127 .",
    "tracers for circumstellar material indicate the presence of a non - continuous gas disk , i.e.  rings , around mwc314 .",
    "we determine a spectral type of b2 and an age of about 6myr ; with a lower - limit initial mass of 40@xmath13 it s the most luminous and most massive star in our sample .",
    "we detect @xmath2co bands in emission in the spectrum of mwc137 indicating an evolved nature of the star . however , the classification of mwc137 as galactic supergiant b[e ] star has to be confirmed with more data .",
    "3 .   mwc84 shows prominent line emissions . after an outburst event in 1998 ,",
    "circumstellar material was clearly and stable detected over decades , e.g.  pfund lines and co emission .",
    "we observed the star at different epochs with lbt - lucii and gemini - gnirs and no signs of a recent prominent eruption was found during 2010 and 2013 .",
    "moreover , the observations reveal the disappearance of the circumstellar pfund lines and the co emission .",
    "4 .   mwc300 is a b[e ] supergiant candidate in a binary system .",
    "its spectrum does not show co emission or absorption at the time of observation .",
    "co absorption bands are found in the spectra of mwc623 and as381 .",
    "both stars have been suspected to be binary systems previously . attributing the observed co absorption to cool companions",
    ", we find a spectral classification of b4ii + k4i - ii ( mwc623 ) and b1 + k0i - ii ( as381 ) and derive the fundamental stellar parameters of the companions .",
    "all sample stars are slightly evolved ( ages of 6 to 50myr ) with progenitor masses in the intermediate to high - mass range ( 7 to 40@xmath13 ) . in the cases of binary stars and candidates",
    ", episodes of mass transfer might have to be considered in the evolution of the components , thus hampering the exact characterization of the systems .",
    "future observations , for example radial velocity variations , pronounced variability , and higher spectral resolution might be needed to ultimately confirm the binary companions .",
    "particularly , mwc84 and mwc300 might be considered as binary supergiant b[e ] candidates in a quiescent transition phase , showing very low densities in their circumstellar envelopes to sustain molecular lines .",
    "unfortunately , some supergiant b[e ] stars can not be distinguished as unambiguously as expected @xcite and further observation are needed to clarify the evolutionary status of these stars .",
