    "in 1957 b. pontecorvo @xcite suggested that , similar to the @xmath9 meson system , neutrino weak eigenstates are not mass eigenstates , but are superpositions of its mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore as neutrinos propagate they would undergo oscillations . the full theory of neutrino oscillation was worked out in several papers @xcite .    the results of the neutrino oscillation experiments ( the solar @xcite , atmospheric @xcite , reactor @xcite and accelerator @xcite neutrino experiments ) have shown that mixing among three generations in the lepton sector exists , analogous to the quark mixing , and at least two neutrinos are massive .",
    "after the discovery of neutrino oscillations , there have been many works for determining the values of the neutrino mass - squared differences and the mixing angles that relate the flavor eigenstates to the mass eigenstates .",
    "the lepton mixing matrix in the standard parametrization is given by @xcite , @xcite : @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( for @xmath12 ) .",
    "the phase @xmath13 is called the dirac phase , analogous to the ckm phase , and the phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 are called the majorana phases that are relevant for majorana neutrinos .",
    "however , we should mention that recently the advantages of the original symmetrical form of the parameterizations of the lepton mixing matrix is discussed in @xcite .",
    "the results of the daya bay and reno collaborations has shown that @xmath16 is now rejected at a significance level higher than @xmath17 .",
    "analysis of current experimental data @xcite yields @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 at the @xmath21 confidence level . also a combined analysis of the data coming from t2k , minos , double chooz , and daya bay experiments shows that the best - fit value of @xmath22 is @xmath23 for normal ( or inverted ) mass hierarchy .",
    "one important aspect of the neutrino mixing phenomena is that it could , in principle , provide new keys for the understanding of the flavor problem , particularly since it contains large mixing angles in contrast to the quark sector . also , the disparity between the neutrino and the charged lepton masses is more pronounced than the analogous one in the quark sector .",
    "therefore , the mass and mixing problem in the lepton sector is a fundamental problem .",
    "also some interesting questions to be solved by future experiments are what are the masses of neutrinos , how close to @xmath24 is the 2 - 3 mixing angle , what are the values of three cp - violating phases of the pmns matrix ( i.e. , the dirac phase @xmath13 and the majorana phases @xmath25 ) .",
    "the simplest way to introduce massive neutrinos is to add right - handed chiral neutrino fields to the standard model and to introduce the neutrino masses in the same way as for the quarks and charged leptons . in this paper",
    ", we mainly focus on the dirac neutrinos .",
    "however , we should mention that the determination of the nature of neutrinos is still a controversial subject which could eventually be decided by experimental observation , such as non - zero magnetic dipole moment of neutrinos ruling out majorana neutrinos or neutrino - less double beta decay ruling out dirac neutrinos .",
    "we believe that at this point in time the study of both types of neutrinos is justified ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a dirac mass term for the neutrinos and charged leptons are written as @xmath26    a successful phenomenological neutrino mass model with the flavor symmetry that is suitable for the dirac neutrinos was proposed by friedberge and lee ( fl ) @xcite . in this model",
    "the mass eigenstates of three charged leptons are identified with their flavor eigenstates .",
    "therefore neutrino mixing matrix can be simply described by a @xmath27 unitary matrix u which transforms the neutrino mass eigenstates to the flavor eigenstates , @xmath28 as we shall show in the pure fl model , one of the neutrino masses is exactly zero , partially justifying the smallness of neutrino masses .",
    "morover when @xmath29 symmetry is assumed , the matrix @xmath30 reduces to the experimentally favored @xmath31 .",
    "the dirac neutrino mass operator of the fl model can be written as @xmath32 all the parameters in this model ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) are assume to be real . for @xmath35 ,",
    "this lagrangian has the following symmetry @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is an element of the grassman algebra . for constant @xmath39",
    ", this symmetry is called fl symmetry @xcite in which case the kinetic term is also invariant .",
    "however the other terms of the electroweak lagrangian do not have such symmetry .",
    "the @xmath40 term breaks this symmetry explicitly .",
    "however we may add that the fl symmetry leads to a magic matrix and this property is not spoiled by the @xmath34 term .",
    "the magic property has many manifestations which we shall discus in details .",
    "also it has been reasoned that the fl symmetry is the residual symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix after the @xmath41 flavor symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "the mass matrix can be displayed by , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the yukawa coupling constant .",
    "the proportionality constant is the expectation value of the higgs field .",
    "it is apparent that @xmath47 possesses exact @xmath7 symmetry only when @xmath48 .",
    "setting @xmath48 and using the hermiticity of @xmath49 , a straight forward diagonalization procedure yields @xmath50 where , @xmath51 and the experimentally favored tribimaximal ( tbm ) neutrino mixing matrix can be reproduced and is given by @xmath52 obviously the requirement that all of the mass eigenvalues are positive puts conditions on the parameters of this model . in particular @xmath53 must be positive .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath31 was first proposed on theoretical grounds by harrison , perkins and scott in 2002 @xcite . for a general exact tbm neutrino",
    "mixing , regardless of the model , the mixing angles are @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath16 and the cp - violating phases can be chosen to be zero .",
    "in general in order to have cp - violation , the necessary condition is @xmath56 and @xmath57 . in this model",
    "these conditions necessarily mandate that @xmath7 symmetry should be broken .",
    "another interesting question is whether @xmath55 remains correct after the @xmath7 symmetry breaking .",
    "there are four",
    "independent cp - even quadratic invariants , which can conveniently be chosen as @xmath58 and @xmath59 and three independent cp - odd quadratic invariants @xcite , @xmath60\\nonumber\\\\i_{2}&=&\\im[(u^{\\ast}_{11}u_{13})^{2}].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the jarlskog rephasing invariants @xmath61 @xcite , is relevant for cp violation in lepton number conserving processes like neutrino oscillations . @xmath62 and @xmath63 are relevant for cp violation in lepton number violating processes like neutrinoless double beta decay .",
    "oscillation experiments can not distinguish between the dirac and majorana neutrinos .",
    "the detection of neutrinoless double beta decay would provide direct evidence of lepton number non - conservation and the majorana nature of neutrinos .",
    "many theoretical and phenomenological works have discussed massive neutrino models that break @xmath7 symmetry as a prelude to cp violation@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the fl model by introducing complex parameters which can ultimately be linked to complex yukawa coupling constants .",
    "we concentrate on the massive fl dirac model , imposing the obvious constraint that mass eigenvalues be real . using this model",
    "we obtain cp violation , mild @xmath7 symmetry breaking @xcite , and inverted mass hierarchy for neutrinos .",
    "moreover the measures of these two symmetry breakings turn out to be proportional to each other .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we introduce our model and show how the constraint of reality of masses along with the minimal breaking of @xmath7 symmetry , and the overall self consistency of the model produces relationships between the free parameters of the model .",
    "we find that in our model @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "notice that we have ruled out the case @xmath68 as we shall explain . in section 3 , we show that our model is in general consistent with the experimental data , and show that implementing all of the constraints coming from the experimental data , severely restricts the parameters of our model , an in fact almost pinpoints the relevant parameters .",
    "section 4 is devoted to a summary .",
    "in this section , we generalize the fl model by adding complex yukawa coupling constants , in order to obtain cp violation .",
    "this is accomplished by obtaining non - zero values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "we first let all of the coefficients in the @xmath49 matrix eq.([e4 ] ) except @xmath34 be complex .",
    "however we demand the eigenvalues of the mass matrix to be real .",
    "we find that only one particular choice allows for minimal breaking of @xmath7 symmetry , _ i.e. _ @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "this requirement leads to a non - hermitian mass matrix . for simplicity of notation",
    "we define the parameters as follows : @xmath73",
    ". the parameters indicating the measure of cp violation and @xmath7 symmetry breaking turn out to be proportional to @xmath0 and therefore we expect it to be small .    the neutrino mass matrix @xmath74 is given by @xmath75    notice that @xmath76 and @xmath49 are both magic and symmetric matrices since they both commute with the magic @xmath77 matrix defined bellow",
    ", @xmath78 therefore one of the eigenstates is @xmath79 , and we choose it to be @xmath80 in order to be consistent with eq.([e5 ] ) . in the special case @xmath81 , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is called the democracy operator .",
    "it is obvious that the real part of @xmath76 has cp and @xmath7 symmetry , separately .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath76 breaks both of these symmetries , while preserving the product of these two operations .",
    "therefore @xmath84 is invariant under simultaneous cp and @xmath7 reflection operations , which is called the mutativity operation @xcite .",
    "this reduction of the symmetry , causes the symmetry of neutrino mixing matrix to reduce from tbm to tm .    a naive diagonalization of @xmath76 yields , @xmath85 however the usual diagonalization procedure is correct only for hermitian matrices , where a similarity transformation by a unitary operator , i.e. @xmath86 , diagonalizes the matrix .",
    "therefore the results indicated in eq.([e11 ] ) are correct only in the limit @xmath87 , and the results in this limit suffice for our analysis to follow . comparing our results in this limit with those shown in eq.([e6 ] ) , we conclude @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath76 is a non - hermitian matrix , we need two distinct unitary matrices @xmath30 and @xmath89 to diagonalize it .",
    "these matrices can be easily obtained by diagonalizing @xmath90 and @xmath91 , separately . @xmath30 and @xmath89 are the conventional transformation matrices for the left - handed and right - handed neutrinos , respectively .",
    "we do not display the explicit form of @xmath30 and @xmath89 and only mention that @xmath92 .",
    "the resulting correct diagonal matrix is obtained by @xmath93 and its elements are as follows ,    @xmath94    after the diagonalization we find that only @xmath95 and @xmath96 are complex .",
    "we can extract the phases and transfer them to the mass eigenstates in the dirac case @xcite . the most general form the diagonal mass matrix can be written as",
    ", @xmath97 in our model @xmath98 automatically turns out to be zero .",
    "we would dispense with the overall phase even if it was not zero .",
    "using the fact that @xmath99 is real , we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "this implies that the @xmath101 . using these conditions in eq.(11 )",
    "we obtain @xmath102 note that disregarding the overall phase amounts to the following : @xmath103 is real and @xmath104@xcite .    from the requirement of the reality of b we obtain @xmath105 .",
    "notice that the lower bound of @xmath106 is simply a check on the condition @xmath107 in eq.([e6 ] ) .",
    "the requirement that in the limit @xmath87 , @xmath30 and @xmath89 should both approach @xmath31 given in eq.([e5 ] ) , yields @xmath108 . combining the condition for reality of @xmath0 with @xmath88",
    ", we obtain @xmath109 . from this and the overall symmetry of the f.l model",
    "we conclude that @xmath110 .",
    "this conclusion is consistent with the results of experiments on solar neutrino oscillation which indicate that @xmath111 .",
    "notice that the occurrence of cp violation is possible only in a restricted region in the @xmath112-@xmath106 plane where @xmath113 .",
    "figure ( [ fig.1 ] ) illustrates the region of the parameter space where cp violation occurs .",
    "substituting the expression for @xmath0 given by eq.([e12 ] ) into the expression we have obtained for @xmath30 by diagonalizing @xmath90 , we obtain     cp violation is possible only in the right - angled triangle in our parameter space .",
    "the axis are defined by @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "the dark triangle displays the allowed region within our model .",
    "( the line above the base of the triangle is given by @xmath116),width=302 ]    @xmath117    notice that our generalized @xmath76 given in eq.([e8 ] ) , has retained its magic property , since we have insisted on having real mass eigenvalues . therefore the mixing matrices @xmath30 and @xmath89 are necessarily tm , which requires for example @xmath118 and their first and third columns add up to zero @xcite .",
    "however the tbm structure is broken down to tm since @xmath119 , and therefore the exact @xmath7 symmetry is broken . as we shall show",
    "this symmetry is only softly broken .",
    "we can conclude from the tm nature of the @xmath30 matrix that @xmath120 .    comparing eq.([e13 ] ) with eq.([e1 ] ) , we immediately obtain all of the mixing angles ( @xmath121 ) and the cp - violating phase in terms of @xmath122 and @xmath34 as follows @xmath123 in other words , the phase difference between @xmath124 and @xmath125 results in a kind of @xmath7 symmetry breaking with a manifestation @xmath57 , while maintaining @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) . from eq.([e1 ] ) , eq.([e12 ] ) and eq.([e14 ] ) we obtain , @xmath128    using eq.([e13 ] ) and the transformation @xmath129 , or by substituting eq.([e12 ] ) in to eq.([e111 ] ) , it is easy to obtain the three neutrino masses @xmath130 where , @xmath131 notice that we get inverse hierarchy for neutrino masses . in the dirac case",
    "one can choose , without loss of generality , the phases of the mass eigenstates ( @xmath132 ) so that @xmath133 reduces to @xmath134 as in eq.([ereal ] ) .",
    "since @xmath76 is a symmetric matrix , it could also be used as a majorana mass matrix . if we work with majorana neutrinos , every element in the mixing matrix will be same as the dirac case .",
    "the phases can be rewritten as , @xmath135 in the majorana case only the phase factor @xmath136 in eq.([emajrana ] ) can be rotated away into the charged lepton sector and the other phase factor remains .",
    "these phases can be transferred to @xmath137 , and comparing eq.([e1 ] ) and eq.([emajrana ] ) one can conclude that the @xmath138 .",
    "these phases also contribute to the cp violation .",
    "therefore in majorana case we obtain three non - zero cp violating phases @xmath70 and @xmath139 , with inverted hierarchy , and the masses are @xmath140 therefore @xmath141 and @xmath74 has no inverse .",
    "this shows that the use of our model for majorana neutrinos can not be consistent with the type i seesaw mechanism proposed in 1980 @xcite .",
    "a rephasing - invariant measure of cp violation in neutrino oscillation is the universal parameter @xmath61 @xcite given in eq.([e7 ] ) , and it has a form which is independent of the choice of the dirac or majorana neutrinos . using eq.([e13 ] ) the expression for j simplifies to , @xmath142 from this expression we can conclude that the maximal cp non - conservation is not just a question of a relative phase assuming the value @xmath143 ; the magnitudes of the coupling constants are also essential .",
    "in fact the maximal cp non - conservation does not correspond to @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "one can see that the soft breaking of @xmath7 symmetry leads to both @xmath57 and @xmath145 , but it does not affect the favorable result @xmath55 , originally resulting from the tbm mixing angles .",
    "in this section we compare the experimental data with the results obtained from our model .",
    "we do this by mapping all of the constraints obtained from the experimental data onto our parameter space , as shown in figure ( [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "note that there is a significant general overlap between the experimental data and the cp - violating part of our parameter space ( as originally shown in figure ( [ fig.1 ] ) ) .",
    ".the allowed ranges for all parameter obtained from the experimental data and our model [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : pper ]    however the most restricting experimental data comes from the values of @xmath146 and @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "these restrictions are shown in the figure ( [ fig.2 ] ) by shaded regions .",
    "therefore the overlap of all of the experimental data and our model is reduced to a tiny region close to the top corner of the triangle . in figure ( [ fig.3 ] )",
    "we have plotted the values of @xmath149 against @xmath146 to elucidate this important overlap region . in table [ h ]",
    "we state all of the relevant experimental results presented at the @xmath21 c.l .",
    "@xcite , along with the restrictions that they impose on the parameters of our model .",
    "the values stated as the results of our model ( combined with experimental data ) in the last column of the table are obtained from the tiny region mentioned above which results in the following restricted values for the parameters of our model , and using @xmath150 : @xmath151     in this figure we show the theoretical region of our model for cp violation along with all available experimental data .",

    "the line immediately above the base of the triangle is the line given by @xmath152 and in our model only the part of the mentioned triangle above this line is allowed .",
    "this line is interesting since on this line the following parameters are all constants : @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , while the derivative of @xmath0 in the direction perpendicular to this line is zero .",
    "moving away from this line in the upward direction , @xmath0 and @xmath22 decrease monotonically to zero , while @xmath70 increases to @xmath156 when the upper border of the triangle ( @xmath157 ) is reached .",
    "the colored region with negative slope indicates the experimentally allowed region for the @xmath146 .",
    "the region delimited by dotted lines indicates the experimentally allowed region for the @xmath158 .",

    "this whole region corresponds to the two colored regions shown in figure ( [ fig.2 ] ) .",
    "the best experimental fit is shown by the darker shaded region in the middle .",
    "our model is represented by the lighter shaded region which overlaps the best experiments fit.,width=340 ]    in figure ( [ fig.2 ] ) we have a special point , @xmath162 at which @xmath163 .",
    "therefore in our model we can not have cp violation at this point , where the neutrino mass matrix reduces to the following special form @xmath164 the first term is identically zero and @xmath76 reduces to the democratic matrix @xmath165 .",

    "this matrix has attracted some attention and several authors have considered generalizations of this matrix to break the degeneracy @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have proposed a generalization of friedberg - lee neutrino mass model , in which cp violation is possible . in our model",
    "the coefficients are allowed to be complex , with the constraint that the mass eigenvalues be real .",
    "we find and display the region in our parameter space where cp violation is possible .",
    "since the parameters of our model are related to the yukawa coupling constants , this region determines a corresponding cp violating region in the space of the yukawa coupling constants . in this region",
    "the resulting mass matrix turns out to be non - hermitian , symmetric and magic .",
    "we find that the symmetry of the neutrino mixing matrix is reduced from tbm to tm with the implication that the @xmath7 symmetry is mildly broken .",
    "comparing the results of our model with experimental data , we find that overlap region is very restricted and this narrows the allowed ranges for the parameters , as shown in table [ h ] .",
    "in particular we find jarlskog parameter is restricted to @xmath8 , which could be tested in the future experiments such as the upcoming long baseline neutrino oscillation ones ) .",
    "also @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath55 and @xmath6 .",
    "we obtain the allowed ranges for the values of three masses @xmath168 , @xmath169 and @xmath2 , therefore we have inverted hierarchy .",
    "this generalization could also be used for massive majorana neutrinos , because the generalized mass matrix is still symmetric . in majorana case",
    "all of the parameters are identical to the dirac case , except that there are two extra cp violation phases @xmath170 . however , since @xmath141 , the mass matrix @xmath74 is not invertible .",

    "<S> we propose a phenomenological model of dirac neutrino mass operator based on the fridberg - lee ( fl ) neutrino mass model to include cp violation . by considering the most general set of complex coefficients , and imposing the condition that the mass eigenvalues are real </S>",
    "<S> , we find a neutrino mass matrix which is non - hermitian , symmetric and magic . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we find that the requirement of obtaining real mass eigenvalues by transferring the residual phases to the mass eigenstates self - consistently , dictates the following relationship between the imaginary part of the mass matrix elements @xmath0 and the parameters of the fl model : @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain inverted neutrino mass hierarchy , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> making a correspondence between our model and the experimental data produces stringent conditions on the parameters as follows : @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we get mildly broken @xmath7 symmetry , which reduces the resultant neutrino mixing pattern from tribimaximal ( tbm ) to trimaximal ( tm ) . the cp violation as measured by the jarlskog parameter </S>",
    "<S> is restricted by @xmath8 . </S>"
