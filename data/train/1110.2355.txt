    "electroweak processes in which either an electron is scattered elastically off a hadron or the hadron decays weakly into another hadron and an electron - antineutrino pair provide a lot of information about the composition of hadrons in terms of their constituents .",
    "the electric and weak coupling constants are small enough such that leading - order perturbation theory suffices to get meaningful results for the scattering and decay probabilities . in leading - order",
    "the invariant scattering or decay amplitudes become just contractions of a leptonic with a hadronic current ( times a @xmath0 , or @xmath1 propagator ) .",
    "the most general covariant decomposition of the hadronic current leads to the introduction of form factors .",
    "these are lorentz - invariant functions of the 4-momentum transferred to the hadron .",
    "they contain all the information about the substructure of the hadron , i.e. the deviation from a point - like hadron , and can be directly extracted from ( polarized ) scattering or decay cross sections .",
    "the theoretical challenge is now to relate the hadron current to the currents of its constituents . under poincar transformations a hadronic current operator",
    "should transform covariantly  @xcite .",
    "since the binding interaction shows up in some of the poincar generators , depending on the form of relativistic dynamics to be used , it follows that @xmath2 must , in general , also depend on the binding interaction and can not be a simple sum of the constituent currents .",
    "further constraints for a theoretical model of a hadron current come from current conservation , i.e. @xmath3 , and from the requirement that the hadron charge should be the sum of the constituent charges , independent on whether the binding interaction is present or not .",
    "we are primarily interested in calculating electroweak form factors of strongly bound few - body systems within the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "a common procedure is to calculate the bound - state wave function for a given binding force and use it to _ construct _ a model for only the minimum number of current components that is needed to fix the form factors uniquely .",
    "the remaining current components are then determined by covariance and current conservation . in usual front - form ,",
    "e.g. , it suffices to know the @xmath4 component if one calculates the current in the @xmath5 frame  @xcite .",
    "this kind of procedure , however , has the drawback that the results for the form factors will , in general , slightly depend on the chosen current components and on the reference frame in which the construction of the current is done  @xcite .",
    "our strategy is rather to _ derive _ a full 4-vector current that is compatible with the binding forces and valid in any reference frame within a poincar invariant quantum mechanical setting .",
    "as it turns out , such a current exhibits some unphysical features which , however , can be split off in a unique way leaving a 4-vector current with all the desired properties .",
    "surprisingly , the outcome of our approach resembles very much the results obtained within the covariant light - front formalism that was suggested in ref .",
    "this is the more remarkable since we use the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics . in this form",
    "all components of the 4-momentum become interaction dependent , whereas the lorentz generators stay free of interactions .",
    "this guarantees simple boost and covariance properties of wave functions and physical observables , respectively .",
    "our derivation of electroweak form factors starts with the physical processes in which the form factors are measured , i.e. elastic electron - hadron scattering and the weak decay of hadrons .",
    "we describe these reactions by means of a coupled - channel framework in which the dynamics of the intermediate gauge bosons  either a photon or a w - boson  is fully taken into account .",
    "poincar invariance is ensured by employing the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite . in its point - form version the ( interacting ) 4-momentum operator @xmath6 is factorized into an interacting mass operator and a free 4-velocity operator @xmath7",
    "it is therefore only necessary to study an eigenvalue problem for the mass operator .",
    "we will exemplify our approach through elastic electron - meson scattering with the meson being a spin-0 confined quark - antiquark system . in this case a mass eigenstate @xmath8 and a quark - antiquark - electron - photon component @xmath9 .",
    "the mass eigenvalue equation to be solved has then the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 consist of a kinetic term and an instantaneous confining potential between quark and antiquark , and @xmath13 is a vertex operator which accounts for the absorption ( emission ) of a photon by the electron or ( anti)quark . it is derived from the interaction lagrangean density of qed  @xcite .",
    "the current matrix elements that are necessary for the calculation of the electromagnetic meson form factors can be extracted from the invariant 1-photon - exchange amplitude .",
    "this is essentially given by the on - shell matrix elements of the optical potential @xmath14 .",
    "these matrix elements exhibit the expected structure : @xmath15 such that the meson current @xmath16 can be easily identified .",

    "the leading - order invariant transition amplitude @xmath29 in this case can be derived from a 4-channel problem .",
    "in addition to the incoming @xmath30 channel and the outgoing @xmath31 channel one needs a @xmath32 and a @xmath33 channel to account for the intermediate states in which the @xmath1-boson is in flight .",

    "current and the bound - state wave functions can be found in ref .",
    "as a next step we will analyze the properties of the electromagnetic meson current @xmath43 that follows from eq .  ( [ eq : contract ] ) . since we are using velocity states in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are always defined in the center - of - mass of the electron - meson system , @xmath46 does not transform like a 4-vector under a lorentz transformation @xmath47 , but it rather transforms by the wigner rotation @xmath48 . a current with the correct transformation properties",
    "is obtained by going back to the physical meson momenta @xmath49 , i.e. by boosting the center - of - mass momenta with the overall velocity @xmath50 of the electron - meson system : @xmath51^\\mu_\\nu j^\\nu_{\\mathrm{em}}(\\vec k_m';\\vec k_m)\\ , .\\ ] ] @xmath52 is the boost matrix of a rotationless boost .",
    "if @xmath53 is a pseudoscalar meson it can be shown that @xmath54 is conserved , i.e. @xmath55  @xcite . since internal momenta are integrated over , the most general covariant decomposition of @xmath56 thus takes on the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 . with the bakamjian - thomas construction we have a nice poincar invariant treatment of the electron - meson system , but the price we pay is a dependence of the meson current on the electron momenta which should not be there .",
    "it is the consequence of wrong cluster properties , a well known drawback of the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite . as numerical studies reveal",

    "( [ eq : jcov ] ) ) we have to go back to the physical particle momenta to obtain a current that transforms like a 4-vector .",
    "we have to note , however , that the momentum transferred to the meson is now timelike , whereas it is spacelike in electron - meson scattering .",
    "interestingly , wrong cluster properties of the bakamjian - thomas construction do not entail unphysical properties of the decay current .",
