    "quantum computer holds promise that it owns the great power to solve classically intractable problems such as factoring a number  @xcite and searching a data in an array  @xcite .",
    "this is , in general , accomplished by performing specific unitary transformations on a set of quantum bits (qubits) followed by measurement .",
    "the basic element of a computer is the logic gate , either in a classical computer or a quantum computer .",
    "now it has been shown that one - qubit gates and two qubit controlled phase gates are universal for constructing a quantum computer , i.e. any multiqubit gates can be achieved by choosing appropriate set of these elementary gates . in practical quantum computing , the implementation of quantum algorithms and quantum error - correction protocols may involve multiqubit quantum gates  @xcite . as the number of the qubits increases , the procedure of decomposing multiqubit gates into several basic elementary gates becomes more and more complicated .",
    "it is necessary to develop a way to realize the multiqubit quantum gate directly .",
    "in particular , the multiqubit controlled phase gate which shifts the phase of only one of the state components is of great importance .",
    "this gate can be widely used in quantum algorithms  @xcite , quantum fourier transform  @xcite , and quantum error correction  @xcite . by placing the hadamard gates before and after the three - qubit controlled @xmath1-phase gate on one of the qubits one can implement the toffoli gate that performs a controlled not operation on a target qubit depending on the state of two control qubits . a number of theoretical schemes  @xcite have been proposed to implement the toffoli gate , and it has been demonstrated experimentally in nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite , linear optics  @xcite , ion traps  @xcite , and circuit qed systems  @xcite .",
    "however , the controlled phase gates involving more than three qubits have not been experimentally implemented .",
    "though an n - qubit controlled phase gate could be decomposed into the elementary one- and two - qubit gates , it requires much longer times and yields lower overall fidelities .",
    "for example , the toffoli gate implemented with only single- and two - qubit gates requires six controlled - not gates and ten single - qubit operations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is hard to realize the phase gates involving more than three qubits in any system owing to current limits on coherence .    recently , several schemes , such as @xmath3-control qubits acting on one target qubit  @xcite , one control qubit simultaneously controlling n target qubits , based on cavity qed or circuit qed  @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "for example , yang et al  @xcite present a way to realize an @xmath3-qubit controlled phase gate with superconducting quantum - interference devices (squids) by coupling them to a superconducting resonator .",
    "the implementation of three - qubit phase gate requires seven operational steps , and adjusting the level spacings of the squid to couple corresponding energy level . in their proposal , the required steps for the @xmath3-qubit controlled phase gate is @xmath4 , which make the experimental procedure much complicated and difficult to perform with the increase of the number of qubits .",
    "zhang et al  @xcite proposed a scheme for one - step implementation of an n - qubit controlled - phase gate in a superconducting quantum interference device system .",
    "the scheme focuses on that @xmath3 squid qubits simultaneously and nonidentically couple to a resonator mode and the microwave pulses , which requires individual addressing on each qubit .",
    "it also poses a challenge to the present experimental condition as the number of qubits increases .",
    "moreover , the phase can not be tunable .",
    "it is just a @xmath1-phase gate .    here , we propose a scheme for realization of multiqubit tunable phase gate with only one step .",
    "this scheme differs remarkably from others due to the fact that we employ the quantum zeno dynamics  @xcite and asymmetric encoding for the quantum information .",
    "compared with previous proposals , our scheme owns several advantages as following : ( i ) the scheme requires only one - step evolution ; ( ii ) individual addressing on each qudit is not required and only a classical microwave pulse is needed to drive the central qudit @xmath5 , which greatly loosens the requirement for the experimental conditions ; ( iii ) no auxiliary qubits , no measurements on the qubit states , and no photon detection are required ; ( iv ) neither adjustment of the qudit level spacings nor adjustment of the resonator mode frequency during the gate operation is required ; ( v ) in the non - resonant case , the phase is tunable .",
    "it can be adjusted by changing the rabi frequency of the pulse applied to the target qubit , the detuning and the interaction time .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we briefly introduce the our model with four - level quantum systems coupled to resonators where are connected by the common coupler , and how to realize the gate within such a system . in sec .",
    "iii , we give a brief discussion of the effectiveness of our model through numerical simulation . in sec .",
    "iv , we generalize the model to @xmath2-qubits case . a concluding summary",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "we consider a system consisting of two resonators each hosting a fluxonium qudit  @xcite and interconnected by a common fluxonium qudit @xmath5 capacitively , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) .",
    "the fluxonium qudit is biased properly to have four lowest levels , which are denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) , respectively [ fig .",
    "[ fig:1](b ) and ( c ) ] .",
    "for all the qudits , the resonator mode is off - resonant with the transition @xmath11 while decoupled from the transition between any other two levels of fluxonium qudits . here , @xmath12",

    ", the transition @xmath15 is driven dispersively by a classical microwave pulse with rabi frequency @xmath16 and detuning @xmath14 . in the interaction picture ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the whole system can be written as @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the total interaction of the whole system , @xmath21 is the interaction between the qudits and the resonators ( or classical microwave pulse ) , and @xmath22 is the annihilation operator of resonator @xmath23 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath12(@xmath10 ) and @xmath16 are all real , and @xmath24 . to implement the three qubit quantum phase gate",

    "the other computational states @xmath87 and @xmath88 ( where @xmath89 ) are decoupled from the hamiltonian and do not undergo any change during the evolution of the system . in this way , the system keeps in the initial state with an tunable additional phase shift .",
    "therefore , we obtain a three qubit tunable phase gate @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the phase . additionally , if @xmath92 , this transformation plus the hadamard gate on the qubit @xmath5 with @xmath93 , @xmath94 , we can obtain a three qubit toffoli gate .",
    "_ resonant case : _ when @xmath95 , after time @xmath96 , the state of the system becomes @xmath97 .",
    "after a full cycle of rabi oscillation , i.e. , @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 .",
    "thus , the system returns to the initial state with an additional phase shift @xmath1 . in this way",
    ", we obtain a three - qubit controlled phase gate @xmath100 in which , if and only if the three qubits are in the state @xmath67 , the system undergoes a phase shift @xmath1 .",
    "in order to validate the feasibility of the above theoretical analysis , we perform a direct numerical simulation of the schrdinger equation with the original hamiltonian eq .",

    "the validity of our scheme is based on the assumption that all the coupling strengths of qudit - resonator mode are equal , namely , @xmath24",
    ". however , there could be deviation in the parameters in a practical situation .",
    "these errors result in the mismatch of the coupling constants @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",

    "a deviation @xmath113 only causes a reduction smaller than 3@xmath114 in the fidelity .",
    "it is apparent that the fidelity of phase gate is always higher than 97@xmath114 under various deviations of the selected parameters .",
    "thus our scheme is very robust against some errors which occurred in a practical case .    until now",

    "the subspaces involved during the whole process include the excited states of the cavities , which greatly influence the fidelity of the phase gate .",
    "however , in the resonant case , the results are reverse .",
    "the energy relaxation of the qubits becomes the main decoherence source due to the resonant interaction , as shown in fig.[fig:4]b . in real circuit qed system ,",
