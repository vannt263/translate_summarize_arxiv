    "the concepts of baryonic matter in a cold dilute phase with clustering of nucleons in the lightest nuclei @xmath11he , @xmath6he , @xmath12h and @xmath6h have been developed in the last decade @xcite .",
    "theoretical developments carried out in this direction orient towards the study of cluster groups as integral quantum systems and give motivation to a new generation of experiments on cluster spectroscopy @xcite . since the macroscopic cluster states can play the role of an intermediate phase in astrophysical processes ,",
    "these studies assume the significance going beyond the framework of the nuclear structure problems @xcite .",
    "the method of nuclear track emulsion provides a uniquely complete observation of multiple fragment systems produced in dissociation of relativistic nuclei .",
    "approximate conservation of the initial momentum per nucleon by relativistic fragments is used in the kinematical analysis of the events to compensate the lack of momentum measurements .",
    "the fragmenting system excitation can be defined as q = m@xmath13-m , where m@xmath13 is the invariant mass and   the projectile mass or total fragment mass .",
    "the value m@xmath13 is defined by the relation m@xmath14 = ( @xmath15p@xmath16)@xmath12=@xmath15(p@xmath17p@xmath18 ) , where p@xmath19 4-momenta fragments i and the k , determined in the approximation of the conservation of the primary momentum value per nucleon .",
    "the most valuable events of coherent dissociation of nuclei in narrow jets of light and the lightest nuclei with a net charge as in the initial nucleus , occurring without the formation of fragments of the target nuclei and mesons ( the so - called whitestars ) @xcite , comprise a few percent among the observed interactions .",
    "the data on this phenomenon are fragmented , and the interpretation is not offered . the dissociation degree of light o , ne , mg and si , and as well as heavy au , pb and u nuclei may reach a complete destruction to light and the lightest nuclei and nucleons , resulting in cluster systems of an unprecedented complexity .",
    "the dissociation dynamics of heavy nuclei can be grounded on dissociation peculiarities established for light nuclei .",
    "an extensive collection of photographs of such interactions is gathered by the becquerel collaboration @xcite .    despite the fact that the potential of the relativistic approach to the study of nuclear clustering is recognized long ago , e - experiments were not be able to get closer to the required detailed observation of the relativistic fragment ensembles .",
    "the related pause has led to the proposal to irradiate nuclear track emulsion in the jinr nuclotron beams of the whole family of 1.2  a  gev light nuclei , including radioactive ones @xcite .",
    "studies with relativistic neutron - deficient nuclei have special advantages due to more complete observations .",
    "the dissociation features of @xmath0be , @xmath1c , and @xmath2n nuclei , which are the sources of basic cluster configurations , will be presented in the present paper .",
    "in order to justify the application of the relativistic fragmentation in the study of n@xmath7-systems @xcite it was suggested to investigate the dynamics of the formation of @xmath7-particle pairs at a high statistical level and under the simplest conditions ( without combinatorial background ) which are provided in the relativistic fragmentation @xmath0be@xmath52@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the secondary @xmath0be beam was obtained by fragmentation of accelerated @xmath8b nuclei @xcite . when scanning the exposed emulsion 500 events @xmath0be@xmath52@xmath7 in a fragmentation cone of 0.1 rad have been found .",
    "about 81% @xmath7-pairs form roughly equal groups on @xmath20 : narrow(0 @xmath21 10.5 mrad ) and wide(15.0 @xmath22 45.0 mrad ) ones .",
    "the @xmath23 pairs are consistent with @xmath4be decays from the ground state 0@xmath3 , and pairs @xmath24 - from the first excited state 2@xmath3 .",
    "the @xmath23 and @xmath24 fractions are equal to 0.56@xmath250.04 and 0.44@xmath250.04 .",
    "these values are well corresponding to the weights of the @xmath4be 0@xmath3 and 2@xmath3 states @xmath26 = 0.54 and @xmath27 = 0.47 in the two - body model n - @xmath4be , used to calculate the magnetic moment of the @xmath0be nucleus @xcite .",
    "for the coherent dissociation @xmath0be@xmath52@xmath7+n , the average value of the total @xmath7-pair transverse momentum is equal to @xmath28 80  mev / c , which can be assigned to the average transverse momentum carried away by neutrons . for the @xmath0be coherent dissociation through the @xmath4be 0@xmath3 and 2@xmath3 states",
    "there is no differences in the values @xmath29 , which points to a cold fragmentationmechanism .",
    "the whole complex of these observations may serve as an evidence of the simultaneous presence of the @xmath4be 0@xmath3 and 2@xmath3 states with similar weights in the ground state of the nucleus @xmath0be .",
    "one can expect that the pattern established for the @xmath30be @xcite and @xmath4b @xcite nuclei is reproduced for nucleus @xmath0c with the addition of one or two protons .",
    "in addition , the emergence of a 3@xmath6he ensemble becomes possible .",
    "an intriguing hypothesis is that in the nuclear astrophysical processes the 3@xmath6he system can be a 3@xmath7-process analog .",
    "a secondary beam , optimized for @xmath0c nucleus selection was formed by fragmentation of accelerated @xmath2c nuclei @xcite .",
    "it was important in this irradiation to avoid overexposure by the accompanying flux of @xmath6he nuclei .",
    "the intensity ratio of the nuclei with charges z@xmath31 = 6 and 2 amounted to 1 : 10 .",
    "this factor has limited statistics and made the scan for @xmath0c interactions much more labor demanding .    among the total number of whitestars n@xmath32 , detected in this exposure , 15 events @xmath0c@xmath10b+p and 16 events",
    "@xmath30be+2p are found .",
    "statistics in the channels 2he+2h ( 24 ) , he+4h ( 28 ) and 6h ( 6 ) well corresponds to the @xmath30be core dissociation .",
    "the event fraction @xmath0c@xmath53@xmath6he ( 16 ) was found to be the same as that of the channels @xmath0c@xmath10b+p and @xmath30be+2p .",
    "the latter fact can point to a significant admixture of a virtual 3@xmath6he state in the @xmath0c ground state .",
    "this component can give a contribution to the @xmath0c magnetic moment , which has an abnormal value in terms of the shell model @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8c nucleus is the only example of the system , which has the super - boromean properties , since the removal of one of the four clusters in the 2@xmath7 + 2p structure ( threshold 3.8  mev ) leads to an unbound state .",
    "the particular feature of the @xmath2n nucleus consists in the low proton separation threshold ( 600  kev ) .",
    "furthermore , the dissociation can occur through the channels @xmath7+@xmath4b ( 8  mev ) , p+@xmath30be+@xmath7 , as well as into more complicated ensembles with the @xmath30be core break .",
    "generation of @xmath2n and @xmath8c nuclei is possible in charge exchange and fragmentation reactions of accelerated @xmath2c nuclei @xcite .",
    "the charge to weight ratio z@xmath31/a@xmath31 differs by only 3% for these nuclei , while the momentum acceptance of the separating channel is 2 - 3% .",
    "therefore , their separation is not possible , and the @xmath2n and @xmath8c nuclei are simultaneously present in the secondary beam , forming a so - called beam cocktail .",
    "the contribution of @xmath2n nuclei is small in respect to @xmath8c ones in accordance with the cross sections for charge transfer and fragmentation reactions .",
    "also , the beam contains @xmath30be nuclei , differing by z@xmath31/a@xmath31 from @xmath2n nuclei only by 2% .    due to",
    "the momentum spread @xmath6he nuclei can penetrate in the separating channel . for neighboring @xmath4b , @xmath0c and @xmath33c nuclei",
    "the difference by z@xmath31/a@xmath31 from @xmath2n is about 10% , which leads to suppression in these isotopes .",
    "identification of @xmath2n nuclei can be performed by @xmath34-electron counting along the beam tracks . in the @xmath8c case ,",
    "relying on the charge topology of the produced whitestars it is necessary to be sure that the neighboring carbon isotope contribution is small .",
    "these considerations provided the justification to expose nuclear track emulsion in a mixed beam of @xmath2n , @xmath8c and @xmath30be nuclei .    the initial scanning phase consisted in visual search of beam tracks with charges z@xmath31=1 , 2 and z@xmath352 .",
    "the ratio of beam tracks with charges z@xmath31= 1 , 2 and z@xmath362 is found to be equal @xmath37 1 : 3 : 18 .",
    "thus , the contribution of @xmath6he nuclei dramatically decreased compared with the @xmath0c irradiation , which radically raised the event search efficiency .",
    "the presence of fragments z@xmath382 makes the charge identification of beam z@xmath31 and secondary z@xmath39 tracks necessary . for the calibration the average density of @xmath34-electrons n@xmath40 was measured along the beam tracks , which produced the whitestars 2he+2h , 2he and he+2h , and also stars with fragments z@xmath382 ( @xmath2n candidates ) .",
    "thus , the correlation between the charge topology @xmath15z@xmath39 and n@xmath40 was established which permitted to determine beam track charges z@xmath31 and the fragment charges z@xmath382 .    for whitestars",
    "n@xmath32 with charge topology @xmath15z@xmath39=6 the most probable channel is represented by 91 events 2he+2h , which might be expected for the isotope @xmath8c .",
    "the channel he+4h is found to be suppressed ( 14 events ) , as in the @xmath8c case it is required to overcome the high threshold of the @xmath7-cluster break up .    in this irradiation",
    "20 whitestars with z@xmath31=7 and @xmath15z@xmath39=7 are found , corresponding to the dissociation of @xmath2n nuclei .",
    "there are the following channels among them : c+h ( 1 ) , @xmath30be+he+h ( 2 ) , @xmath30be+3h ( 4 ) , @xmath4b+2h ( 3 ) , 3he+h ( 2 ) , 2he+3h ( 6 ) , he+5h ( 3 ) .",
    "thus , half of the events contain a fragment z@xmath38 2 , clearly differing from the cases of nuclei @xmath41n @xcite and @xmath8c .",
    "the unbound @xmath4be nucleus plays the role of the core in the @xmath8c structure , which should be manifested in the fragmentation intensity @xmath8c@xmath10be .",
    "distribution @xmath7-pairs in the 91 whitestars 2he+2h on the excitation energy q@xmath42 is presented in fig .",
    "1 . in 30 events",
    "the q@xmath42 value does not exceed 500 kev ( inset in fig .",
    "1 ) . for them , the average value is @xmath43110@xmath2520  kev and the mean - square scattering @xmath44=40  kev , which well corresponds to the decays of the @xmath4be 0@xmath3 ground state .",
    "the @xmath4be 0@xmath3 contribution is approximately the same as for the neighboring cluster nuclei",
    ".    the unbound @xmath0b nucleus can be another major product of the @xmath8c coherent dissociation .",
    "2 shows the distribution of whitestars 2he+2h on the excitation energy q@xmath45 , defined by the difference of the invariant mass of the three fragments 2@xmath7+p and the mass of the proton and the doubled @xmath7-particle mass .",
    "the q@xmath45 values for one of two possible 2@xmath7+p triples do not exceed 500  kev in 27 events ( inset in fig .",
    "the average value for these triples is @xmath46=250@xmath2515  kev with rms @xmath44=74  kev .",
    "these values well correspond to the @xmath0b ground state decay via the channel p+@xmath4be ( 0@xmath3 ) having the published values of energy 185  kev and width ( 0.54@xmath250.21 )  kev@xcite . in the region limited by",
    "q@xmath471  mev ane time both triples correspond to the decay of the nucleus @xmath0b . in all other @xmath0b cases",
    "one of q@xmath45 is above 500 kev .",
    "in addition , excitations @xmath7",
    "+ 2p are studied on the remaining statistics of whitestars 2he+2h beyond @xmath0b decays . in the spectrum of q@xmath45 , there is no clear signal of @xmath48be decays @xcite , and its estimated contribution does not exceed 20% .",
    "this aspect deserves further analysis taking the proton angular correlations into account .",
