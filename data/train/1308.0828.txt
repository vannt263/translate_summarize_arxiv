    "bilayer systems which host excitons represent one of the most interesting class of systems since the bound electron - hole pairs represent a neutral boson while their constituents are charged fermions .",
    "if the particles feel their mutual coulomb attraction but the layers are insulated from each other indirect excitons , consisting of layer - separated electron - hole pairs , can have extremely long lifetimes.@xcite due to the high tunability of experimental parameters such systems offer a comparable variability as in cold atom experiments with the additional possibility of direct investigation via electric current.@xcite recently increasing attention has been triggered by new experimental results both for the bec and the bcs phase .",
    "however , excitonic bilayer systems offer a much richer variety of phases due to their electronic nature and the electric dipole moment of the electron - hole pair.@xcite + in this paper we want to show that many aspects of this rich variety can be directly detected solely measuring the electric current@xcite without going over to more elaborate optical readout schemes@xcite .",
    "indeed , the different phases of the bilayer system lead to qualitatively different results for the current properties .",
    "+ in this work we will concentrate on two examples : the phase transition to a wigner crystal - like phase and the topological phase transition to a phase hosting majorana fermions . while the former has already been discussed to some extent in the literature@xcite we will show that also the latter exists .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : section [ s2 ] will introduce the basic hamiltonian formalism we will use in order to describe a non - interacting excitonic system and its transport properties . the topological phase transition in this system",
    "is discussed in section [ s3 ] along with its consequences for the drag conductance . in section [ s4 ]",
    "we will use our description to investigate the photo - electric effect in an exciton bilayer illuminated by a laser field both with dipole - dipole interactions of the excitons and without .",
    "we will summarize our results in section [ s5 ] .",
    "the basic model system is well established@xcite and depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] : an exciton bilayer ( eb ) is contacted by four metallic electrodes via tunnel contacts and described by the hamiltonian @xmath0 where the term @xmath1 describes four metallic drains which are described as fermionic continua written in terms of electron field operators @xmath2 at chemical potentials @xmath3 using fermi distributions @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 refers to the contacts on the left / right side of the eb and @xmath6 labels the top and bottom layer , respectively .",
    "the metallic drains are taken to be in the wide flat band limit so that their density of states ( dos ) @xmath7 is constant .",
    "the additional sum over spin degrees of freedom can be dropped here since either spin is irrelevant as the system is a non - interacting mixture of spins@xcite or ( using a high enough magnetic field ) the system is spin - polarized.@xcite         + hopping between the leads and the eb is given by @xmath8 using tunneling amplitudes @xmath9 .",
    "finally we describe the eb using a simple one - dimensional model@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the longitudinal distance between the right and left side of the eb , @xmath12 is the two - layer spinor and @xmath13 describe the electron / hole single particle hamiltonian of the top and bottom layer .",
    "interlayer coulomb interaction gives rise to an exciton order parameter @xmath14 , which we assume to be constant .",
    "each layer has its own chemical potential @xmath15 and we denote the corresponding fermi distribution by @xmath16 . + we use a green s function method to calculate the cumulant generating function of charge transfer which gives direct access to the currents and possible higher cumulants through the device in question.@xcite we introduce counting fields for every possible electron - transfer in the system @xmath17 .",

    "the pauli matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 operate in particle - hole and top - bottom space , respectively . +",
    "one should note that we assume the exciton condensate to be two - dimensional and electrically connected to the superconductors on each side in a sandwich structure . this way we are allowed to treat the proximity induced coupling in a mean - field approach.@xcite",
    "furthermore we assume the condensate to be contacted at two points as in typical experiments.@xcite + the spectrum can be revealed@xcite by squaring @xmath42 twice , which yields @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",
    "the gap@xcite @xmath45 near @xmath46 is the key to the emergence of majorana fermions .",
    "we find @xmath47 consequently , we observe an exchange field - dominated ( or strong interaction induced ) gap if @xmath48 and hence the eb in this case will host majorana fermions .",
    "the end of the eb can be characterised by a sharp drop of the chemical potential , which closes the gap .",
    "since this transition corresponds to a transition out of the topological phase majorana fermions will be localized at the eb ends . however ,",
    "this was to expected since we have basically created a system consisting of two times the kitaev model .",
    "the only difference to the former proposal is that now we will have four majoranas instead of two , however , in a physically very different system .",
    "the situation is slightly different when discussing topological exciton condensates.@xcite + the main features of the majorana fermions for the system in question are their localisation at the ends of the eb and the presence of four instead of two . since we have assumed the eb to be contacted at two points we address a single channel in both layers so that we will see only four majorana fermions forming at the respective contacted points .",
    "there are four due to the additional layer degree of freedom of the eb . +",
    "as discussed above we are allowed to treat the eb in a mean - field approach .",
    "if the eb is in the topological phase both layers can therefore be treated as @xmath37-wave superconductors with an effective @xmath37-wave gap of @xmath45 .",
    "majorana fermions alter the characteristics of andreev reflection at the interface to such superconductors by contributing an additional phase shift.@xcite the consequence of this additional phase shift is a perfectly transmitting channel at @xmath49 through the upper and lower layer of the eb.@xcite however , since conductance through the upper and lower layer is perfect , there can be no transconductance in this case due to unitarity .",
    "therefore the phase transition to a majorana fermion phase can be easily seen by a vanishing transconductance and a peak in the differential conductance at @xmath50 through the layer in question .",
    "indeed , these two signatures can be easily observed by simple condutance measurements and a verification of the presence of majoranas does not require to also measure e.g. the josephson current.@xcite",
    "a possible application of an eb is in the fashion of a solar cell .",
    "the most simple setup in order to demonstrate this application , is an eb which is contacted to metallic electrodes and irradiated by a laser field as skteched in fig .",
    "we first study the eb irradiated by the laser field alone and will afterwards introduce the contacts .    .",

    "@xmath52 is the rabi frequency of the exciton transition and @xmath53 describes the detuning of the laser field from this transition . in a typical experiment",
    "one uses short and high intensity laser pulses to excite the system . under these conditions",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath52 is of the same order as the exciton binding energy.@xcite we therefore set @xmath54 in the following to simplify the discussion .",
    "@xmath53 is the detuning of the laser field from this transition .",
    "using a laser field allows to generate excitons via exciting an electron from the valence band of the bottom layer .",
    "the excitons can now be either excited or not which allows to map the system to a two - level system of @xmath55 randomly arranged interacting spin-1/2 systems .",
    "the hamiltonian reads@xcite @xmath56 when we can neglect interactions between the excitons . @xmath57 denote pauli matrices in the effective two level system .",
    "the model assumes that we use high - intensity laser pulses so that every energetically favorable transition will take place .",
    "using lower laser power will result in a smaller number of excitons .",

    "if we would additionally include interaction we would have to add a term @xmath87 in which @xmath88 describes the strength of the mutual dipole - dipole repulsion.@xcite the inclusion of such a term leads to the formation of a wigner crystal of the excitons at strong enough interaction @xmath88 .",
    "the strength of the interaction needed has been discussed in the literature using different numerical procedures.@xcite the formation of such a wigner crystal at a certain interaction strength @xmath89 leads to crystallization of of the electrons themselves and therefore the number of free charge carriers as calculated in eq .",

    "consequently , this vanishing photoelectric effect is a clear signature for the phase transition to a wigner crystal and can again be monitored by simple conductance measurements .",
    "+ we should add that in realistic implementations of the proposed setup tunneling between the two layers can not be fully suppressed , as assumed here .",
    "the role of such a term has been discussed in the literature@xcite and depends on the specific implementation . in the typical quantum hall bilayer",
