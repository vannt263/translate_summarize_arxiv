    "galactic - scale outflows ( superwinds ) , driven by stellar winds from massive stars and core - collapse supernovae ( sn ) from active star - forming galaxies , represent an important feedback process of galaxy evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the superwinds will eject metals and enrich halo gases and intergalactic medium ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "they also detected an emission line around @xmath3 kev , which is likely due to the  k@xmath4 line at 6.7 kev .",
    "this is expected in the scenario of superwinds @xcite , which predicts a metal - enriched hot plasma at temperatures of @xmath5 k. the corresponding fe abundance is about 0.3 solar abundance if assuming a thermal spectrum .",
    "@xcite examined and discussed fe lines of m82 in detail .",
    "they found that the fe 6.7 kev line luminosity is consistent with that expected from the enrichment of previous sn ejecta .",
    "they also reported a marginal detection of the fe 6.4 kev line , which is a fluorescent line of the neutral - like fe .",
    "the fe 6.7 kev line is important to understand the driving plasma of superwinds .",
    "it is the most prominent emission line at such high temperatures and thus the best tracer of the metal enrichment . if all the fe produced by massive stars",
    "are mixed in the hot plasma , the expected fe abundance will be around 5 times solar abundance , in contrast to the observed 0.3 times solar abundance @xcite .",
    "it then implies there is other contribution to the diffuse continuum , in addition to the thermal continuum , or part of the fe is depleted from the x - ray emitting gases .    in previous studies , the nuclear region of m82",
    "is taken as a whole and no spatial analysis has been done due to the limited statistics ( the total exposure is less than 50 ks ) . in this letter",
    ", we present a detailed spatial study of the fe 6.7 kev line of m82 with 500 ks of  archival data , which is a factor of 10 longer than that used in previous studies .",
    "the deep data allows a significant detection of the fe 6.4 kev line , which is informative to study the coexistence of cold molecular and hot gases .",
    "we also report a point source showing the fe 6.7 kev line , which provides strong implications for the mixing level of fe produced by massive stars .",

    "the contribution of the low - temperature component is about 5% around @xmath13 kev and negligible for higher energies .",

    "@xcite found that the differential luminosity function of the x - ray point sources in star - forming galaxies follows the form of @xmath17sfr , where @xmath18 is the @xmath19 kev x - ray luminosity in units of @xmath20 erg s@xmath21 and sfr is the star formation rate measured in units of m@xmath22  yr@xmath21 .",

    "we test the effect of the unresolved sources by including a power - law model with a photon index of 1.8 , the contribution of which is fixed at 20% .",
    "the fitted temperatures is a little lower , but still in the ranges obtained without considering the unresolved sources .",
    "the fe abundances are increased by about 20% compared with the results without the power - law model .",

    "one source only appears in the 2010 exposures ( obsid 10545 and 11800 ) and because its statistics is too low to provide a reliable analysis , it is discarded here .",

    "to further illustrate the spatial distribution of the fe 6.4 and 6.7 kev lines , we plot the flux map of photons within @xmath26 kev and @xmath27 kev in figure 4 . we see that both emissions have diffuse morphology and similar spatial extent .",
    "the @xmath27 kev map is slightly more extended along the minor axis of the disk than the @xmath26 kev map .",
    "it is also clear that the two maps do not exactly follow each other and some regions with high @xmath26 kev flux show less @xmath27 kev flux .",

    "the emission of both lines have similar spatial extent , but their morphology do not exactly follow each other .",
    "the total luminosity of the fe 6.7 kev line is about @xmath28 erg s@xmath21 , which is consistent with the value measured by @xcite .",
    "the total luminosity of the fe 6.4 kev line is about @xmath23 erg s@xmath21 .",
    "the spectra can be fitted well with a cie model plus a gaussian line over the energy range of @xmath14 kev .",
    "the fitted temperatures are around @xmath29 kev , which are consistent with the scenario of superwinds @xcite .",
    "the fitted fe abundances are around 0.5 solar value .",
    "@xcite calculated the fe abundance produced by sn ejecta and stellar winds using _",
    "starburst99 _ and found 5 times solar abundances .",
    "however , the iron may not be well mixed with the hot plasma .",
    "the spectrum of the point source a provides an fe abundance of 1.7 times solar value .",
    "although source a can not be the population of snrs that are responsible for the present hot gas , if it represents a typical case , then the iron may be depleted heavily .",
    "a mild mass - loading of a factor 3 will make the fe abundance of source a in agreement with that of the hot gas .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the inverse compton spectrum will have a photon index around 1.3 if the electron population is also responsible for the synchrotron radiation .",
    "this index is different from our fitting results of the power - law models , which have photon indices around 2 .",
    "the contribution of a power - law model of index of 1.3 can not exceed 50% , otherwise it will produce more flux than observed at energies above 7 kev . adding a power - law model of index of 1.3 to the fit will lower the fitted temperatures . if we require the fitted temperatures to be above 4 kev , the contribution of the inverse compton emission can not exceed 30% .",
    "this is consistent with the contribution fraction of 25% estimated by @xcite . including both the contributions of unresolved point sources and inverse compton emission will increase the fe abundances to @xmath30 solar value , still far below the expected value if there is no depletion of fe .",
    "we have assumed thermal cie models when fitting the fe abundances in  3 .",

    "the electron density can be estimated from the normalization of vapec model , which is @xmath38 , where @xmath39 ( in units of cm ) is the distance to m82 , @xmath32 and @xmath40 are the electron and hydrogen densities in units of @xmath37 .",
    "we adopt a depth of 0.6 kpc , which is the disk spatial extent of the x - ray emitting region of m82 . assuming a filling factor of 1 and @xmath41 , the electron density @xmath42 @xmath37 for the hot gas in the nuclear region of m82 .",
    "this gives an ionization equilibrium timescale of @xmath43 yr .",
    "it is relatively short compared with the typical timescale ( @xmath44 yr ) in the starburst region and the outflow timescale ( @xmath45 yr ) of the nuclear region of m82 .",
    "it suggests that non - equilibrium - ionization is unlikely to be important for the fe 6.7 kev line of m82 .",
    "when applying a non - equilibrium ionization model ( vnei ) , we find no improvement in the fits , and it provides a little higher temperature ( @xmath46 kev ) and a lower fe abundance .    the fe 6.4 kev line is the fluorescent line of neutral - like fe . it has also been observed in another starburst galaxy of ngc 253 @xcite .",
    "they attributed the 6.4 kev line to the irradiation of molecular gas by surrounding point sources .",
    "a similar mechanism is applicable for m82 , the nuclear region of which contains plenty of cold molecular gases ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the luminosity of all nuclear point sources within @xmath46 kev is about @xmath47 erg s@xmath21 , which is about 15 times the @xmath46 kev luminosity of the diffuse emission and 100 times the luminosity of the fe 6.4 kev line .",
