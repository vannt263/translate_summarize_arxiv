    "<S> therefore , multiple scattering in momentum space between physical partons correspond to an expansion in power series of @xmath17 . in this letter , we limit ourselves to double scattering in momentum space . with only single and double scattering </S>",

    "<S> ( [ dyqt2b ] ) , we see that @xmath70 directly depends on the quark - gluon correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the broadening is a very good observable for measuring quark - gluon correlation functions .    if we use lqs model for @xmath71 given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ tim ] ) , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqt2b ] ) , we can derive a much simpler expression for the broadening , @xmath72 from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqtxf ] ) , we can see that the drell - yan transverse momentum broadening should have similar @xmath0 dependence as the differential cross section @xmath73 if the lqs model for @xmath74 is valid . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , by comparing the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , we can provide an immediate test of lqs model for the correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that even if lqs model is not a good approximation for the quark - gluon correlation functions , measuring the @xmath0-dependence of the nuclear broadening provides excellent information for extracting the quark - gluon correlation functions @xmath77 directly , as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqt2b ] ) .    in the following , we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqtxf ] ) to obtain the numerical estimates of the @xmath0 dependence of the drell - yan transverse momentum broadening . </S>",
    "<S> although the value of @xmath78 for the correlation function is not well determined , a different value of @xmath78 corresponds to a simple adjustment to the overall normalization . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the uncertainty in the value of @xmath78 should not affect our following discussions .    in obtaining our following numerical results </S>",
    "<S> , we use the cteq4l distribution as the quark distributions in the nucleon . for effective quark distributions in the nucleus , we define @xmath79 , and use eks98 for the parameterizations of @xmath80 @xcite , which fit the data well . </S>",
    "<S> we choose the renormalization and factorization scale to be @xmath81 , and choose the incoming beam energy @xmath82  gev which is the energy used by the fermilab experiments @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we plotted @xmath83 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqtxf ] ) as a function of @xmath0 with @xmath84 and @xmath85  gev and 11  gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted lines correspond to eks98 parameterizations of effective nuclear parton distributions . in order to separate the nuclear dependence caused by multiple scattering and that caused by the effective nuclear parton distributions </S>",
    "<S> , we also plotted @xmath86 in solid curves with @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the solid and dotted lines is a direct consequence of the difference between nucleon and nuclear parton distributions . as shown in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqt2b ] ) , @xmath88 represents the momentum fraction of a quark ( or antiquark ) from the nuclear target . at @xmath89 , we have @xmath90 for @xmath85  gev , and @xmath91 for @xmath92  gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath85  gev and @xmath92  gev cover very different range of @xmath88 . for @xmath85  gev </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath93 corresponds to @xmath94 or corresponds to the shadowing region , while @xmath95 covers the region of emc effect . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the drell - yan pairs of @xmath92  gev are not sensitive to the nuclear shadowing at all . </S>",
    "<S> the entire range of @xmath0 values matches the range of emc effect which include the antishadowing region ( @xmath96 ) , and the emc suppression region ( @xmath97 ) , as well as the fermi motion region for larger @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> such dependence in effective nuclear quark distributions are clearly shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a , the dotted line is above the solid line in the central region of @xmath0 due to the fact that @xmath88 is in the antishadowing region . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is positive , the dotted line is below the solid line because @xmath98 is now in the shadowing region . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 is less than zero , the dotted line is again below the solid line due to the fact that @xmath88 is now in the region of emc suppression . on the other hand , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b shows slightly different relation between the dotted and solid line due to the fact that at @xmath92  gev , @xmath88 covers a different range as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> although the nuclear dependence in effective nuclear parton distributions change the @xmath0 dependence of the drell - yan transverse momentum broadening , the change ( e.g. , the difference between the dotted and solid lines in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) is extremely small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the @xmath0 dependence of the nuclear broadening , @xmath2 is not very sensitive to nuclear shadowing , and can be an excellent probe of parton multiple scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the transverse momentum broadening , parton multiple scattering also causes the energy loss . in recent experiments , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the cross section per nucleon from the drell - yan pair production in @xmath99 collisions has been used as a direct measurement of the parton energy loss in nuclear medium @xcite . however , as pointed out in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a substantial fraction of the variation in the cross section ratios versus @xmath100 comes from the shadowing of @xmath101 at small @xmath88 , and therefore it is difficult to extract precise information on parton energy loss from the cross section ratios . on the other hand , bdmps showed that for a jet produced in nuclear matter , the energy loss per unit length @xmath102 and the transverse momentum broadening @xmath103 has the following relation  @xcite : @xmath104 similar to eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ loss - dpt ] ) , one can use the transverse momentum broadening of the drell - yan pair @xmath105 to estimate the parton energy loss due to the initial state multiple scattering . as we demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , the variation in the shape of @xmath2 due to the shadowing is small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath2 is also a good probe for the parton energy loss .    </S>",
    "<S> cross sections on nuclear targets are often parameterized as @xmath48 times corresponding cross sections on a nucleon target . in principle , the power @xmath33 can be a function of @xmath10 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 , as well as other physical observables . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear dependence of @xmath33 is often used to study the effects of multiple scattering . in recent experimental studies of the j/@xmath106 and @xmath107 suppression in @xmath99 collisions @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , data was presented in terms of @xmath33 as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath108 in different @xmath0 regions . </S>",
    "<S> it was found @xcite that the shapes of @xmath109 are very similar in different regions of @xmath0 , and it was concluded @xcite that the parton energy loss is independent of the @xmath110 energy .    using our result of @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also estimate the @xmath33 as a function of @xmath3 in different @xmath0 region for the drell - yan production . </S>",
    "<S> we define the parameter @xmath111 for the drell - yan production as @xmath112 if @xmath3 is not too large , the @xmath3 spectrum of the drell - yan pairs can be approximately parameterized by a gaussian form @xcite , @xmath113 \\ ; \\label{qtexpn}\\ ] ] and @xmath114 \\ . \\label{qtexpa}\\ ] ] substituting eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ alpha - qt ] ) , we used eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dydqt2 ] ) . in order to estimate the value of @xmath111 </S>",
    "<S> , we use the value @xmath117gev@xmath62 for the cross section per nucleon @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> and we use eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dyqtxf ] ) to integrate over different ranges of @xmath0 value to obtain the @xmath68 in different ranges of @xmath0 . for @xmath84 , </S>",
    "<S> we choose three different @xmath0 ranges , which are the same as the regions used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , small @xmath0 ( sxf : @xmath118 ) , intermediate @xmath0 ( ixf : @xmath119 ) , and large @xmath0 ( lxf : @xmath120 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for these three @xmath0 regions , we obtain the corresponding values of @xmath121 as [ 0.10 , 0.043 , 0.026 ]  gev@xmath62 for @xmath85  gev , and [ 0.078 , 0.043 , 0.027 ]  gev@xmath62 for @xmath92  gev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that the value of @xmath122 should be very small , and the power @xmath111 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alpha - qt ] ) can be approximated as @xmath123\\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{alpha - qt0}\\ ] ] from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alpha - qt0 ] ) , we conclude that if @xmath3 is not too large , @xmath111 should show linear dependence on @xmath124 ( or quadratic dependence on @xmath3 ) . for the drell - yan production </S>",
    "<S> , we expect an extremely small coefficient due to a weak transverse momentum broadening ( or a small @xmath122 value in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alpha - qt0 ] ) ) .    in the above discussion </S>",
    "<S> , we used the same averaged value of @xmath125 for different @xmath0 ranges . in principle </S>",
    "<S> @xmath125 should also have @xmath0 dependence due to kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> the larger @xmath126 , the smaller @xmath125 . </S>",
    "<S> hence @xmath125 should have similar @xmath0 dependence as @xmath2 shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath127 should have even smaller dependence on @xmath0 .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we plotted our predictions for the value of @xmath111 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ alpha - qt ] ) as a function of @xmath3 in three different @xmath0 regions . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , it is clear that the shape of @xmath111 in different @xmath0 ranges are similar to what was observed in recent data on j/@xmath106 and @xmath107 suppression @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such similarity is natural because both @xmath3 spectrum of the drell - yan and charmonium production can be approximated by a gaussian form when @xmath3 is not too large . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we emphasize that as shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , even though @xmath111 seems not to be sensitive to @xmath0 , the @xmath0 dependence of transverse momentum broadening , @xmath128 , can be very strong .    in summary , we derived the @xmath0 dependence of the drell - yan transverse momentum broadening in terms of quark - gluon correlation functions . </S>",
    "<S> we predicted that @xmath2 has a strong @xmath0 dependence . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , if the lqs model for the correlation functions is valid , @xmath129 should have similar @xmath0 dependence as the differential cross section @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrated that @xmath2 is a very sensitive observable to study the effects of initial state multiple scattering and the parton energy loss . </S>",
