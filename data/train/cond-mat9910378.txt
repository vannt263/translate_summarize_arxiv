    "considerable effort has been recently devoted to the understanding of magnetic films , layered structures and superlattices[1 - 7 ] . with the development of molecular beam epitaxy",
    ", it is now possible to grow in a very controlled way magnetic films with few atomic layers or even monolayer atop nonmagnetic substrates .",
    "a superlattice in which the atoms vary from one monolayer to another can also be envisaged .",
    "very often one finds unexpected and interesting properties in these systems .",
    "for example , experimental studies[8 - 10 ] on the magnetic properties of surfaces of gd , cr and tb have shown that a magnetically ordered surface can coexist with a magnetically disordered bulk phase .",
    "most work has been devoted to the free surface problem in which spins on the surface interact with each other through an exchange interaction @xmath0 different from that of bulk material[11 - 20 ] . for the values of @xmath1 above a certain critical value @xmath2 the system orders on the surface before it orders in the bulk . below this critical value",
    "only two phases are expected , namely the bulk ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases .",
    "magnetic excitations in superlattices were studied in numerous papers ( see , e.g. , ref.21 for a brief review ) . yet",
    "less attention has been paid to critical behavoir .",
    "the phase transition temperatures for a heisenberg magnetic superlattices have been studied [ 22 - 24 ] . hinchey and mills have investigated a superlattice structure with alternating ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic layers[25 - 26 ] .    in this paper , we are concerned with phase transitions in ising magnetic films and superlattices .",
    "we study them within the framework of mean field theory .",
    "the transfer matrix mathod is used to derive nonlinear equations for magnetic ising films and superlattices .",
    "the equations are general ones for arbitrary exchange interaction constants . in section",
    "ii , we outline the formalism and derive the nonlinear equation for phase transition temperatures of magnetic films .",
    "the transition temperatures as a function of surface exchange constants are studied . the nonlinear equation for transition temperatures of superlattices",
    "are given in section iii .",
    "the last section iv is devoted to a brief discussion .",
    "we start with a lattice of localized spins with spin equal to @xmath3 .",
    "the interaction is of the nearest - neighbor ferromagnetic ising type .",
    "the ising hamiltonian of the system is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 are plane indices , @xmath6 are different sites of the planes , and @xmath7 is spin variable .",
    "@xmath8 denote the exchange constants and are plane dependent .",
    "we will keep only nearest - neighbour terms .    in the mean - field theory ,",
    "@xmath7 is replaced by its mean value @xmath9 associated with each plane , and is determined by a set of simultaneous equations @xmath10,\\ ] ] where @xmath11 are the numbers of nearest neighbours in the place and between the planes , respectively , @xmath12 is the boltzman constant and @xmath13 is the temperature .    near the transition temperature , the order parameter @xmath9 are small , eq.(2 ) reduces to @xmath14    let us rewrite the above equation in matrix form in analogy with ref.[27 ] @xmath15 with @xmath16 as the transfer matrix defined by @xmath17    we consider a magnetic film which contains @xmath18 layers with layer indices @xmath19 . from eq.(4 ) , we get @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents successive multiplication of the transfer matrices @xmath22 .    for an ideal film system",
    ", there exists symmetry in the direction perpendicular to the surface , which allows us to write @xmath23 .",
    "then , the following nonlinear equation for the transition temperature can be obtained from equations ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) as @xmath24 ^ 2+(r_{12}-r_{21 } ) [ ( k_bt - z_0j_{11})/(zj_{1,2})]-r_{22}=0.\\ ] ]    the above equation is the general equation for the transition temperature of symmetric films .",
    "it is suitable for arbitrary exchange interaction constants @xmath8 .",
    "all the information about the phase transition temperatures of the system is contained in the equation .    for a uniform system with @xmath25 , eq.(7 )",
    "reduces to @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the reduced temperature and @xmath28 . here the matrix @xmath29    note that @xmath30 , we can linearalize matrix @xmath31 as[28 ] @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the unit matrix , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . substituting eq.(10 ) into eq.(8 ) , we reduce eq.(8 ) to its simplest form @xmath36    @xmath37 can be rewritten as @xmath38/\\sin\\phi\\ ] ] for @xmath39 . here",
    "@xmath40 $ ] .",
    "for @xmath41 , @xmath42 becomes @xmath43 , and the trigonometric functions become hyperbolic functions of @xmath44 .",
    "eq.(11 ) gives @xmath45+z_0/z.\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath46 , the reduced bulk temperature @xmath47 is obtained as @xmath48    fig.1 shows the reduced transition temperature vs. layer number @xmath49 .",
    "it can be seen that the film transition tempeature is lower than the bulk one , i.e. , the film disorders at a lower temperature than the bulk ones . throughout this paper , we take @xmath50 as the unit of energy .    in the above discussions , we have assumed the surface exchange constants @xmath0 are the same as the bulk exchange constants @xmath50 .",
    "now we consider a @xmath51 film consisting @xmath52 top surface layers , @xmath53 bulk surface layers and @xmath52 bottom surface layers , and assume that the exchange constants in a surface layer is denoted by @xmath0 and that in a bulk layer or between successive layers by @xmath50 . in this case the total transfer matrix @xmath31 becomes @xmath54 where the matrix @xmath55 and @xmath56 are @xmath57 here we have assumed that the spins lie on a simple cubic lattice , i.e. , @xmath58 . since @xmath59",
    ", the matrix @xmath60 and @xmath61 can be linearalized in analogous to eq.(10 ) . in this case , the nonlinear eq.(7 ) reduces to @xmath62    the numerical results for transition temperatures of a magnetic @xmath51 film as a function of @xmath1 are shown in fig.2 .",
    "it is can be seen that the transition temperature increase as @xmath1 increases . for @xmath63 ,",
    "the transition temperatures in film @xmath64 are nearly equal to the bulk temperature @xmath65 .",
    "it is interesting that the transtion temperature increases linearly with the increase of @xmath1 when @xmath1 is large enough .",
    "we can also see that the transition temperature increases as layer number increases .",
    "the @xmath66 superlattice structure we study is formed from two types of atoms . in each elementary unit with layer indices @xmath67 , there are @xmath52 atomic layers of type @xmath68 and @xmath53 atomic layers of type @xmath69 .",
    "the interlayer exchange constants are given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , whereas the exchange constants between different layers is described by @xmath50 .",
    "for the above model of the superlattice , the transfer matrix @xmath22(eq.(5 ) ) reduce to different types of matrix @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 . from eq.(4 ) , we can obtain the following equation as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the total transfer matrix .    due to the periodicity of the superlattice , we know @xmath77 and @xmath78 . then from eq.(19 ) , we get @xmath79 it can be easily seen that @xmath80 .",
    "then the eq.(21 ) reduces to the simplest form @xmath81    actually , the above equation is a general equation for phase transition temperature of superlattices .",
    "it is valid for arbitrary exchange constants @xmath8 .",
    "the nonlinear eqution for films are dependent on both diagonal and nondiagonal terms of the total transfer matrix @xmath31 , while the nonlinear equation for superlattices are only depend on diagonal terms of @xmath31 .    for the total transfer matrix @xmath82",
    ", we get @xmath83 the matrix @xmath84 and @xmath85 can be linearlized as @xmath86 where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 . from eq.(23 ) , we get the equation @xmath91 for @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the above equation reduces to @xmath94 which is identical with the result of ref.(2 ) and ( 29 ) .",
    "next we numerically calculate the phase transition temperatures from eq.(25 ) .    in figure 3",
    ", we have shown the results for the superlattices @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "the transition temperature is plotted as a function of @xmath97 . for @xmath98 ,",
    "the transition temperature is smaller that the bulk transition temperature . for @xmath99 ,",
    "the transition temperature of the superlattice is independent of @xmath100 and @xmath53 . and are equal to the bulk temperature @xmath65 as expected . on the other hand , for @xmath101 ,",
    "the transition temperature is greater than the bulk temperature @xmath65 .",
    "the transition temperature increases with the layer number in one unit cell and approaches @xmath65 asymptotically as the number become large .",
    "the transition temperature increases nearly linearly with @xmath97 when @xmath97 is large enough . the layer number of superlattices @xmath102 and @xmath103 are same , but the transition temperatures are different . for @xmath98 , the transition temperatures of superlattice @xmath103 are larger than those of superlattice @xmath102 . in contrary to this , the transition temperatures of superlattice @xmath103 are smaller than those of superlattice @xmath102 for @xmath101 .",
    "in summary , we have studied phase transitions in ising magnetic films and superlattices with the framework of mean field theory . by transfer matrix method ,",
    "we have derived two general nonlinear equations for phase transition temperatures in ising films and superlattices , respectively .",
    "the transition temperatures as a function of exchange interaction constants are calculated .",
    "in addition , the equations can be easily solved and the parameters involved can be adjusted at will .",
