    "gravitationally lensed quasars are known to potentially provide estimates of the hubble constant @xmath2 from measurements of the time delays between the quasar intrinsic brightness variations seen in different quasar images ( refsdal 1964 ) . since a phenomenon of gravitational lensing is controlled by the surface density of the total matter ( dark plus luminous )",
    ", it provides a unique possibility both to determine the value of @xmath2 and to probe the dark matter content in lensing galaxies and along the light paths in the medium between the quasar and observer .    by",
    "now the time delays have been measured in about 20 gravitationally lensed quasars resulting in the values of @xmath2 that are generally noticeably less than the most recent estimate of @xmath2 obtained in the hst hubble constant key project with the use of cepheids  @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( freedman et al . 2001 ) .",
    "this discrepancy is large enough and , if the hubble constant is really a universal constant , needs to be explained . a detailed analysis of the problem of divergent @xmath2 estimates inherent in the time delay method , and the ways to solve it can be found , e.g. , in keeton & kochanek ( 1997 ) , saha & williams ( 1997 ) , kochanek ( 2002 ) , kochanek & schechter ( 2004 ) and schechter ( 2005 ) , read et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and in many other works .",
    "the main sources of uncertainties in determining @xmath2 are :    * low accuracy of the time delay estimates caused by poorly sampled and insufficiently accurate light curves of quasar components , as well as by microlensing events and , as a rule , by low amplitudes of the quasar intrinsic variability ; * difference in the values of cosmological constants adopted in deriving @xmath2 ; * invalid models of mass distribution in lensing galaxies .    the way to reduce the effect of the first source of errors is clear enough : more accurate and better sampled light curves of a sufficient duration are needed .",
    "a choice of the cosmological model is usually just indicated - this is mostly a question of agreement . as to the third item , here the problem of estimating the hubble constant encounters the problem of the dark matter abundance in lensing galaxies .",
    "the problem of determining the hubble constant from the time delay lenses is known to suffer from the so - called central concentration degeneracy , which means that , given the measured time delay values , the estimates of the hubble constant turn out to be strongly model - dependent .",
    "in particular , models with more centrally concentrated mass distribution ( lower dark matter content ) provide higher values of @xmath2 , more consistent with the results of the local @xmath2 measurements than those with lower mass concentration towards the center ( more dark matter ) .",
    "moreover , it has long been noticed that the time delays are sensitive not only to the total radial mass profiles of lensing galaxies , but also to the small perturbations in the lensing potential ( e.g. , blandford & narayan 1986 , witt et al .",
    "2000 , oguri 2007 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that this effect has been recently proposed as a new approach to detect dark matter substructures in lensing galaxies ( keeton & moustakas 2009 ) .",
    "the hubble constant  central concentration degeneracy is a part of the well known total problem of lensing degeneracies : all the lensing observables , even if they were determined with zero errors , are consistent with a variety of the mass distribution laws in lensing galaxies . a strategy for solving this non - uniqueness problem",
    "could be a search through a family of lens models that are capable of reproducing the lensing observables ( williams & saha 2000 , oguri et al .",
    "then many models can be run in order to infer a probability density for a parameter under investigation , e.g. for @xmath2 ( williams & saha 2000 ) .",
    "the most recent studies ( saha et al .",
    "2006 , read et al .",
    "2007 ) have shown that , in such an approach , the discrepancy between the @xmath2 value determined from lensing and with other methods can be substantially reduced if non parametric models for mass reconstruction are used , which can provide much broader range of models as compared to the parametric ones .    in defining priors on the allowed space of lens models ,",
    "it is naturally to assume that lensing galaxies in the time delay lenses are similar in their mass profiles to other early - type ellipticals , that are presently believed to be close to isothermal and admit the presence of the cold dark matter haloes .",
    "the isothermal models are also consistent with stellar dynamics , as well as with the effects of strong and weak lensing .",
    "the quadruply lensed quasars are known to be more promising for solving these problems as compared to the two - image lenses since they provide more observational constraints to fit the lens model .",
    "ten astrometric constraints can be presently regarded as measured accurately enough for most systems .",
    "this especially concerns the relative coordinates of quasar images . as to the lensing galaxiy ,",
    "its less accurate coordinates are often the only reliable information about the lensing object known from observations , with other important characteristics being derived indirectly .",
    "this situation is inherent , e.g. in pg 1115 + 080 with its faint , 0.31- redshift galaxy . of other observational constraints ,",
    "the time delays and their ratios are very important . in quadruple lenses , the time delay between one of the image pairs is usually used to determine @xmath2 , while the other ones form the @xmath2-independent time delay ratios to constrain the lens model , ( keeton & kochanek 1997 ) .",
    "it has long been known that the observed positions of multiple quasar macroimages are well predicted by smooth regular models of mass distribution in lensing galaxies , while their brightness ratios are reproduced by such models poorly , ( e.g. , kent and falco 1988 , kochanek 1991 , mao & schneider 1998 ) .",
    "the first systematic analysis of this problem called `` flux ratio anomalies '' was made by mao & schneider ( 1998 ) , who assumed that the anomalies of mutual fluxes of the components in some lenses can be explained by the presence of small - scale structures ( substructures ) in lensing galaxies or somewhere near the line of sight .    a popular model of forming hierarchical structures in the universe with a dominant content of dark matter",
    "is currently known to poorly explain the observed distribution of matter at small scales . in particular , the expected number of satellite galaxies with masses of the order of @xmath5 remained after the process of hierarchical formation is completed , is an order of magnitude larger than a number of dwarf galaxies with such masses actually observed within the local group ( klypin et al .",
    "1999 , moore et al . 2001 ) .",
    "one of the solutions of this contradiction is a suggestion that some substructures , especially those with low masses , are not luminous .",
    "metcalf and madau ( 2001 ) were the first to note that the dark matter paradigm can naturally explain existence of substructures in galaxies lensing the remote quasars , as proposed by mao and schneider ( 1998 ) to interpret the anomalies of mutual fluxes of quasar macroimages , and vice versa , confirmation of substructures with masses from @xmath6 to @xmath7 is capable of removing the contradiction between the predicted number of the low - mass satellite galaxies and that one actually observed .",
    "the idea turned out to be intriguing and was immediately taken up , ( brada et al .",
    "2002 , chiba 2002 , dalal & kochanek 2002 , keeton 2001 , metcalf & zhao 2002 ) .",
    "investigation of flux ratio anomalies in gravitationally lensed quasars is presently believed to be a powerful tool in solving the problem of the dark matter abundance in the universe .",
    "it is intensively discussed in numerous recent publications ( congdon & keeton 2005 ; keeton et al .",

    "have shown that the observed quasar image positions and fluxes and the galaxy position can be fit well by an ellipsoidal galaxy with an external shear rather than by only an ellipsoidal galaxy , or by a circular galaxy with an external shear .",
    "they noted that a group of nearby galaxies detected by young et al .",
    "( 1981 ) could provide the needed external shear .",

    "our data have made it possible to measure flux ratios for these components for five seasons of observations , and to study their behavior in time and in wavelength . as is noted above",
    ", deviations of flux ratios in quasar macroimages from the theoretical predictions ( flux ratio anomalies ) are presently believed to be diagnostic for detection of substructures in lensing galaxies , which may represent the dark matter .",
    "the idea to detect substructures in lensing galaxies using the anomalies of flux ratios is based on fundamental relationships between coordinates and magnifications of the quasar images , which result from the general lens equation ( schneider , ehler & falco , 1992 ) .",
    "these relationships have been obtained for the first time by schneider and weiss ( 1992 ) and mao ( 1992 ) for several `` smooth '' distributions of lensing potential . in principle , the lens equation is capable of providing six independent relationships between the coordinates and magnifications for a quadruple lens , but only one of them can be checked with the data of observations .",
    "this is the well - known magnification sum rule for a source within a macrocaustic cusp , when three close images emerge : magnification of the central image must be equal to the sum of magnifications of two outer images ( schneider & weiss 1992 ) .",
    "when the source lies near a caustic fold , two images of the same brightness must arise ( keeton , gaudi and petters 2005 , kgp hereafter ) .    since the absolute values of magnifications in macroimages are unknown ( the unlensed quasar can not be observed ) , mao & schneider ( 1998 ) proposed to use the dimensionless quantities @xmath15 for three images emerging when the source is in a caustic cusp , and @xmath16 for the case when the source is at the caustic fold .",
    "indices @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the second expression denote the images at the minimum and saddle points of the fermat surface .    ideally , cusp relation @xmath19 and fold relation @xmath20 hold only when the source lies exactly at the caustic cusp or fold , respectively . in real lenses these relations hold only approximately",
    ". kgp(2003 , 2005 ) fulfilled a detailed study of asymptotic behaviours of the cusp and fold relations and calculated probability distributions of @xmath21 values for several smooth lens models .",
    "the value of deviation of @xmath22 and @xmath21 from zero can be regarded as a measure of probability for the lensing potential to have substrutures on scales smaller than the separation between the closest images ( kgp 2003 , 2005 ) .",
    "kgp ( 2005 ) warn , however , that for fold lenses , the observed violation of the fold relation may just mean that the source is far enough from a caustic fold .",
    "it should be noted that , in principle , the observed anomalies of brightness ratios in images of gravitationally lensed quasars can be explained by other factors , such as microlensing by compact bodies and the effects of propagation phenomena in the interstellar medium ( extinction and scattering , scintillations ) .",
    "these factors are studied in details by kochanek & dalal ( 2004 ) .",
    "they concluded that substructures of cold dark matter is the best explanation for the flux ratio anomalies in some quadruply lensed quasars .",
    "they reminded also that , as was stated for the first time by mao & schneider ( 1998 ) , the fluxes of highly magnified saddle images are very sensitive to small gravitational perturbations as compared to low - magnification images and , even more importantly , these perturbations bias the fluxes towards demagnification , as was also noted by schechter & wambsganss ( 2002 ) .",
    "the a1+a2 image pair in pg 1115 + 080 consists of a highly magnified minimum point image ( a1 ) and saddle point image ( a2 ) situated symmetrically with respect to the fold caustic very close to each other . according to theoretical expectations ( e.g. schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) , the ratio of their fluxes must be close to 1 .",
    "there are numerous measurements of the a2/a1 brightness ratio in pg 1115 + 080 made at different spectral ranges and at different epochs since 1980 , which we tried to assemble in table 1 .",

    "3 , where the available previous data in @xmath8 and @xmath1 are supplemented by our measurements , shows that variations of the a2/a1 flux ratio in time are indeed rather small and slow . however , even if we exclude a marginal value for the date 1983 , march 8 ( vanderriest et al . 1986 ) , which equals 1 with the uncertainty of 0.1 , we will have the a2/a1 flux ratio varying in some regular manner with the amplitude of about 0.15 during the last 25 years . somewhere between 1991 and 1996 ,",

    ", one might conclude that it is an image a1 that became fainter during this time period .",

    "<S> monitoring data in filter @xmath0 spanning the 2004 , 2005 and 2006 seasons ( 76 data points ) demonstrate distinct brightness variations of the source quasar with the total amplitude of almost 0.4 mag . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath0 light curves have shown image c leading b by 16.4d and image ( a1+a2 ) by 12d that is inconsistent with the previous estimates obtained by schechter et al . in 1997 </S>",
    "<S>  24.7d between b and c and 9.4d between ( a1+a2 ) and c. the new values of time delays in pg 1115 + 080 must result in larger values for the hubble constant , thus reducing difference between its estimates taken from the gravitational lenses and with other methods . also , we analyzed variability of the a2/a1 flux ratio , as well as color changes in the archetypal `` fold '' </S>",
    "<S> lens pg 1115 + 080 . </S>",
    "<S> we found the a1/a2 flux ratio to grow during 2001 - 2006 and to be larger at longer wavelengths . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the a2/a1 flux ratio reached 0.85 in filter @xmath1 in 2006 . </S>",
    "<S> we also present evidence that both the a1 and a2 images might have undergone microlensing during 2001 - 2006 , with the descending phase for a1 and initial phase for a2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the a2/a1 flux ratio anomaly in pg 1115 can be well explained both by microlensing and by finite distance of the source quasar from the caustic fold .    </S>",
