    "the detailed study of galaxy evolution began with the pioneering work of edwin hubble at mt .",
    "wilson observatory in the 1920 s .",
    "hubble pioneered the investigation of galaxy properties by classifying galaxies according to their morphological structure , leading to the hubble sequence of galaxies @xcite . in the local universe , the hubble sequence is well defined and widely used ; however ,",
    "as one goes back in distance and cosmic time , morphological classification becomes an increasingly difficult problem .",
    "the advent and rapid growth of ccd technology within the past 30 years has allowed astronomers to image and catalog galaxies that were inaccessible in previous studies . in order to build a deep , comprehensive and coherent theory on galaxy evolution ,",
    "_ complete _ samples of galaxies spanning a wide range of redshifts and look - back times are essential .    within the past ten years several large hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) imaging surveys have been undertaken by various groups , each with their own goals and strategies , all utilizing the advanced camera for survey s ( acs ) high - resolution wide field camera ( wfc ) @xcite .",
    "the all - wavelength extended groth strip international survey ( aegis ; @xcite ) is centered on the extended groth strip ( egs ) and is one of four fields targeted by the deep2 galaxy redshift survey ( @xcite , @xcite ) for extensive spectroscopic follow up .",

    "survey with extensive follow - up spectroscopy from the zcosmos redshift survey @xcite .",
    "a major aim of the deep2 , aegis and cosmos surveys is to study galaxy evolution in the context of large scale structure .",
    "the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods ) ( @xcite,@xcite ) was designed to be one of the deepest _ hst _ imaging campaigns to date ; with its small area but deep imaging , it was designed to probe galaxy evolution down to the faintest galaxies detectable . the galaxy evolution from morphology and seds ( gems )",
    "survey @xcite was designed to study galaxy evolution using multi - wavelength data to construct spectral energy distributions ( seds ) and measure morphologies .",
    "the advanced camera for surveys general catalog ( acs - gc ) unifies the largest _ hst _ acs imaging surveys into a single , homogeneously analyzed data set .",
    "we used the galaxy analysis over large areas : parameter assesment by galfitting objects from sextractor ( galapagos ) code @xcite , which incorporates both galfit @xcite and sextractor @xcite to construct photometric and morphological catalogs derived from the _ hst _ acs imaging .",
    "we provide additional derived data products ( e.g , color images , atlas images , galfit residual images , and acs fits image cutouts ) for every source in the catalog .",
    "we also provide redshifts collated from the various redshift surveys which accompany the imaging data for a large fraction of the sources .",
    "the main goal of the acs - gc data set is to provide a large statistical sample of galaxies with reliable structural and distance measurements ( for a subsample ) to probe the evolution of galaxies over a wide range of look - back times .",

    "understanding how these properties change and evolve with redshift / time is integral in our construction of galaxy evolutionary models and scenarios .",
    "the combination of high - resolution , deep optical imaging and redshift measurements along with the structural parameters provided by the acs - gc make it a powerful data set which can be used to study the evolution of galaxy structures over cosmic times .",
