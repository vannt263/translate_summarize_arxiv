    "we recall that a matrix is defective if its jordan canonical form has at least a non diagonal block associated to an eigenvalue @xmath13 .",
    "let us introduce the @xmath14-pseudospectrum of @xmath0 , @xmath15 where we refer to the classical monograph by trefethen and embree @xcite for an extensive treatise . in his seminal paper @xcite ,",

    "the distance @xmath26 was introduced by demmel @xcite in his well - known phd thesis and has been studied by several authors , not only for its theoretical interest but also for its practical one ( see , e.g. , @xcite for the bounds on @xmath1 presented in the literature , @xcite and references therein for physical applications ) . an interesting formula for computing this distance in the @xmath12-norm has been given by malyshev @xcite .",
    "in the recent and very interesting paper by alam , bora , byers and overton @xcite , which provides an extensive historical analysis of the problem , the authors have shown that when @xmath11 the infimum in ( [ eq : dist ] ) is actually a minimum .",
    "furthermore , in the same paper , the authors have proposed a computational approach to approximate the nearest defective matrix by a variant of newton s method .",
    "such method is well suited to dense problems of moderate size @xmath27 and - even for a real matrix - computes a nearby defective complex matrix , that is a minimizer for ( [ eq : dist ] ) in @xmath28 .",
    "a recent fast algorithm has been given in @xcite , which is based on an extension of the implicit determinant method proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method also deals with the unstructured and provides a nearby defective complex matrix .",
    "the aim of this paper is that of providing a different approach to the approximation of @xmath1 for both @xmath29 and @xmath7 , which may be extended to the approximation of more general structured distances , that is , for example , when restricting the admissible perturbations of @xmath0 to the set of matrices with a prescribed nonzero pattern .",
    "however , a rigorous analysis of general structures is beyond the scope of this paper and we limit the discussion to complex and real perturbations .",
    "the methodology we propose is splitted in two parts .",
    "first , for a given @xmath30 we are interested to compute the following quantity , @xmath31 secondly , we are interested to find the smallest solution to the equation @xmath32 , or more in general , possibly introducing a small threshold @xmath33 , to the equation @xmath34 note that - in this second case - we obtain anyway , as a byproduct of our method , an estimate for a solution of @xmath32 .",
    "we remark that any solution to @xmath32 gives in general an upper bound to @xmath1 .    by the results of alam and bora @xcite",
    ", we deduce that the distance @xmath26 we compute is the same one obtains by replacing the frobenius norm by the @xmath12-norm .",
    "instead , for the real case , the distance we compute is in general larger than the corresponding distance in the @xmath12-norm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we analyze the case of general complex perturbations and in section [ sec:3 ] we derive a system of differential equations which form the basis of our computational framework . by a low rank property of the stationary points of the system of odes , which identify the matrices which allow to compute approximations of ( [ eq : dist ] ) , we consider the projected system of odes on the corresponding low rank manifold in section [ sec:4 ] and prove some peculiar results of the corresponding flow . in section [ sec:5 ]",
    "we pass to consider the case of real matrices with real perturbations and obtain a new system of odes for the computation of ( [ eq : condmax ] ) , which are discussed in section [ sec:6 ] .",
    "in section [ sec:7 ] we present some theoretical results which allow us to obtain a fast method to solve ( [ eq : r ] ) and compute approximations to @xmath1 . in the same section we present the complete algorithm .",
    "afterwards , in section [ sec:8 ] we focus our attention on a few implementation issues and in section [ sec:9 ] show some numerical examples . finally in section [ sec:10 ] we conclude the paper by providing an extension of the method to matrices with a prescribed sparsity pattern .",
