    "the classicality results for @xmath1-adic overconvergent modular forms started with the pioneer work of coleman @xcite , where he proved that an overconvergent modular form of weight @xmath3 and slope @xmath4 is actually classical .",
    "coleman proved his theorem using @xmath1-adic cohomology and an ingenious dimension counting argument .",
    "later on , kassaei @xcite reproved coleman s theorem based on an analytic continuation result by buzzard @xcite . in the hilbert case , sasaki @xcite proved classicality of small slope overconvergent hilbert modular forms when the prime @xmath1 is totally split in the concerning totally real field . with a less optimal slope condition ,",
    "such classicality result for overconvergent hilbert modular forms was proved by the first named author @xcite in the quadratic inert case , and by pilloni and stroh in the general unramified case @xcite .",
    "the methods of @xcite followed that of kassaei , and used the analytic continuation of overconvergent hilbert modular forms .    in this paper , we will follow coleman s original cohomological approach to prove the classicality of cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms .",
    "let us describe in detail our main results .",
    "we fix a prime number @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath0 be a totally real field of degree @xmath6\\geq 2 $ ] in which @xmath1 is unramified , and denote by @xmath7 the primes of @xmath0 above @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the set of archimedean places of @xmath0 .",
    "we fix an isomorphism @xmath9 . for each @xmath10 , we denote by @xmath11 the archimedean places @xmath12 such that @xmath13 induce the prime @xmath10 .",
    "we fix an ideal @xmath14 of @xmath15 coprime to @xmath1 we consider the following level structures : @xmath16 consider a multiweight @xmath17 has central character @xmath18 times a finite character .",
    "this agrees with @xcite . ]",
    "such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "our first main theorem is the following    [ t : classicality theorem introduction ]    let @xmath22 be a cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular form of multiweight @xmath23 and level @xmath24 , which is an eigenvector for all hecke operators .",
    "let @xmath25 denote the eigenvalue of @xmath22 for the operator @xmath26 for @xmath27 .",
    "if the @xmath1-adic valuation of each @xmath25 satisfies @xmath28 then @xmath22 is a classical ( cuspidal ) hilbert modular eigenform of level @xmath29 .",
    "here the @xmath1-adic valuation @xmath30 is normalized so that @xmath31 .",
    "the term @xmath32 is a normalizing factor that appears in the definition of cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms ; any cuspidal overconvergent hilbert eigenform has @xmath26-slope greater than or equal to this quantity . up to this normalizing factor ,",
    "theorem  [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] was proved in @xcite ( and also in @xcite for the quadratic case ) with slope bound @xmath33)$ ] .",
    "the slope bound , believed to be optimal , was conjectured by breuil in a unpublished note @xcite , which inspires this work a lot .",
    "actually , in theorem [ t : strong classicality ] , we also give some classicality results using theta operators if the slope bound is not satisfied , as conjectured by breuil in _ loc .",
    "_ finally , christian johansson @xcite also obtained independently in his thesis similar results for overconvergent automorphic forms for rank two unitary group , but under a even less optimal slope bound .",
    "+ we now explain the proof of our theorem . as in @xcite ,",
    "the first step is to relate the cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms to a certain @xmath1-adic cohomology group of the hilbert modular variety .",
    "we take the level structure @xmath34 to be hyperspecial at places above @xmath1 ; and @xmath35 the corresponding level structure with iwahori group at all places above @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath36 be the integral model of the hilbert modular variety of level @xmath34 defined over the ring of integers of a finite extension @xmath37 over @xmath38 .",
    "we choose a toroidal compactification @xmath39 of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath40 and @xmath41 denote respectively the special fibers of @xmath42 and @xmath36 over @xmath43 , and @xmath44 be the boundary @xmath45 .",
    "let @xmath46 be the ordinary locus of @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath47 denote the corresponding overconvergent log-@xmath0-isocrystal sheaf of multiweight @xmath48 on @xmath40 , and let @xmath49 denote the space of cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms .",
    "we consider the rigid cohomology of @xmath50 over the ordinary locus of @xmath51 with compact support at cusps , denoted by @xmath52 ( see subsection  [ subsection : rigid - coh ] for its precise definition ) .",
    "using the dual bgg - complex and a cohomological computation due to coleman @xcite , we show in theorem [ theorem : overconvergent ] that , the cohomology group above is computed by a complex consisting of cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms .",
    "let us explain more explicitly this result in the case when @xmath0 is a real quadratic field and @xmath1 is a prime inert in @xmath53 .",
    "then the result of theorem  [ theorem : overconvergent ] says that the cohomology group @xmath52 ( together with its hecke action ) is computed by the complex @xmath54 where the @xmath55 s are essentially @xmath56-times composition of the hilbert analogues of the well - known @xmath57-operator for the elliptic modular forms .",
    "we refer the reader to subsection  [ s : bgg ] and remark  [ r : bgg ] for the precise expression of @xmath55 s , and to for the definition of the complex @xmath58 in the general case . here",
    "we emphasize that the natural construction of the complex @xmath59 is automatically hecke equivariant ; this hecke action on its terms @xmath60 differs from those given in @xcite by a twist , except for the last term @xmath61 .",
    "this can be seen using the explicit formulas for @xmath55 , as given in remark  [ r : bgg ] .",
    "an important fact for us is that , under this new hecke action on @xmath62 , the slope condition can be satisfied only for eigenforms in the last term @xmath63 . in other words , if an eigenform @xmath64 satisfies the slope condition , then it has nontrivial image in the cohomology group @xmath65 .",
    "this result on @xmath2-action is explained in proposition [ prop : norm - u_p ] .",
    "moreover , the cohomological approach allows us to prove the following strengthen version of theorem  [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] : if a cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular form @xmath22 of multiweight @xmath23 and level @xmath34 does not lie in the image of all @xmath66-maps , then @xmath22 is a classical ( cuspidal ) hilbert modular form .",
    "the second step of the proof of theorem [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] is to compute @xmath52 using the goren - oort stratification of @xmath41 .",
    "a key ingredient here is the explicit description of these go - strata of @xmath41 given in @xcite . in the quadatic inert case considered above ,",
    "the main results of @xcite can be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath67 and @xmath68 be respectively the vanishing loci of the two partial hasse - invariants on @xmath51 . then the ordinary locus @xmath69 is the complement of the union @xmath70 of the two divisors .",
    "put @xmath71 .",
    "the subvarieties @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath72 are known to be proper smooth subvarieties of @xmath51 which do not meet the cusps .",
    "the main result of @xcite says that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are both @xmath73-bundles over @xmath74 , the special fiber of the discrete shimura variety of level @xmath34 associated to the quarternion algebra @xmath75 over @xmath0 ramified exactly at both archimedean places .",
    "their intersection @xmath72 may be identified with the shimura variety @xmath76 for the same group but with iwahori level structure at @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , these isomorphisms are compatible with tame hecke actions .    in the general case , for each subset @xmath77",
    ", one has the closed go - stratum @xmath78 defined as the vanishing locus of the partial hasse invariants corresponding to @xmath79 .",
    "this is a proper and smooth closed subvariety of @xmath41 of codimension @xmath80 .",
    "the main result of @xcite shows that @xmath78 is a certain @xmath81-bundle over the special fiber of another quaternionic shimura variety .",
    "in fact , this result is more naturally stated for the shimura variety associated to the group @xmath82 with @xmath83 a quadratic cm extension .",
    "we refer the reader to section  [ section : go - stratification ] for more detailed discussion . using this result and the jacquet - langlands correspondence , one can compute the cohomology of each closed go - stratum .",
    "general formalism of rigid cohomology then produces a spectral sequence which relates the desired cohomology group @xmath52 to those of closed go - strata . in the general case , we prove the following    [ t : ord cohomology ] for a multiweight @xmath84 , we have the following equalities of modules in the grothendieck group of modules of the tame hecke algebra @xmath85 : @xmath86= \\big[h^\\star_{\\mathrm{rig}}(x^{{\\mathrm{tor}},{\\mathrm{ord } } } , { \\mathsf{d } } ; \\scrf^{(\\underline{k } , w ) } ) \\big ] = ( -1)^g \\big [ s_{(\\underline{k},w)}(k^p{\\mathrm{iw}}_p ) \\big],\\ ] ] for @xmath87 sufficiently large , where    * @xmath88 takes @xmath89 to itself if @xmath90 and to @xmath91 if @xmath92 ( for the precise definition of @xmath93 , see and ) ; * the superscript slope@xmath94 means to take the _ finite dimensional _ subspace where the slope of the product of the @xmath95-operators is less than or equal to @xmath87 ; and * @xmath96 is the space of classical cuspidal hilbert modular forms of level @xmath35 .    at this point , there are two ways to proceed to get theorem [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] .",
    "the first approach is unconditional .",
    "we first use theorem  [ t : ord cohomology ] to prove the classicality result when the slope is much smaller the weight ( proposition  [ p : weak classicality ] ) .",
    "then we improve the slope bound by studying global crystalline periods over the eigenvarieties ( theorem  [ t : strong classicality ] ) .",
    "in fact , we can prove something much stronger : if an eigenform @xmath22 does not lie in the image of the @xmath66-maps in the complex @xmath58 , then @xmath22 is a classical hilbert modular eigenform ( theorem  [ t : strong classicality ] ) .",
    "this approach , to some extent , relies on the strong multiplicity one of overconvergent hilbert modular forms .",
    "this approach is explained in section  [ section : classicality - i ] .",
    "the second approach is more involved , and we need to assume    * either @xmath1 is inert in @xmath0 , i.e. @xmath1 stays as a prime in @xmath15 , * or the action of the  partial frobenius \" on the cohomology of quaternionic shimura variety are as expected by general langlands conjecture .",
    "( see conjecture  [ conj : partial frobenius ] )    we defer the definition of partial frobenius to the context of the paper .",
    "under this assumption , we can strengthen theorem  [ t : ord cohomology ] as    [ t : ord cohomology strong ] assume the assumption above , the equality in theorem  [ t : ord cohomology ] is an equality in the grothendieck group of modules of @xmath97 $ ] .    this theorem is proved in section  [ section : classicality - ii ] , using a combinatorially complicated argument .",
    "the reason that theorem  [ t : ord cohomology strong ] is stated for the action of squares of @xmath95 is the following : the description of go strata is proved in @xcite using unitary shimura varieties , where only the twisted partial frobenius ( instead of partial frobenius itself ) has a group theoretic interpretation , which is , morally , the hecke operator given by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 denotes the idle of @xmath0 which is a uniformizer at @xmath100 and @xmath101 at other places .",
    "one might be able to fix this small defect by modify the pel type unitary moduli problem slightly differently to define the moduli problem for @xmath102 directly .",
    "however , we do not plan to pursue this approach .",
    "now it is a trivial matter to deduce theorem [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] from theorem  [ t : ord cohomology strong ] ( under the assumption above ) .",
    "in fact , we only need @xmath22 to be a generalized eigenvector for all the @xmath26-operators satisfying the slope condition ( i.e. @xmath22 does not have to be an eigenvector for the tame hecke actions ) .",
    "the upside of this approach is that one may avoid using the strong multiplicity one for overconvergent hilbert modular forms .",
    "this is crucial when studying other quarternionic shimura varieties when strong multiplicity one is not available .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ t : ord cohomology strong ] has its own interest ; as it gives a quite concrete description of the rigid cohomology of the ordinary locus .",
    "another related intriguing question is whether @xmath103 is concentrated in degree @xmath104 .",
    "we shall address this question in the forthcoming paper @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the result depends on the satake parameter at @xmath1 of the corresponding automorphic representation .",
    "our consideration of the cohomology group @xmath105 was stimulated by a conversation with kaiwen lan in december 2011 , and he explained to us the vanishing result lemma  [ lemma : vanishing ] . after we finished the first version of the paper and talked to lan again , we found htat the same cohomology group ( in a more general context ) was used in his recent joint work with m.  harris , r.  taylor and j.  thorne @xcite .",
    "section  [ section : hmv ] reviews basic facts about hilbert modular varieties , as well as the dual bgg complex .",
    "we define cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms in section [ section : ocgt hmf ] and show that the cohomology of the complex @xmath58 of cuspidal overconvergent hilbert modular forms agrees with the rigid cohomology of the ordinary locus ( theorem  [ theorem : overconvergent ] ) .",
    "moreover , we show that the slopes of @xmath95-operators are always greater or equal to the normalizing factor in theorem  [ t : classicality theorem introduction ] ( corollary  [ prop : slopes - ocv ] ) . after this",
    ", we set up the spectral sequence that computes the rigid cohomology of the ordinary locus in section  [ section : spectral sequence ] .",
    "entire section  [ section : go - stratification ] is devoted to give description of the cohomology of each go - strata ; this uses the earlier work @xcite .",
    "the last two sections each gives an approach to prove classicality ; one unconditional but with some help from eigenvarieties ; one is more straightforward but relying on some conjecture on partial frobenius actions .",
    "we express our sincere gratitude to kai - wen lan for his invaluable help on the compactification of hilbert modular variety .",

    "this is the case when @xmath2555 is odd .",
    "hence the periods for all cyclic words @xmath2550 are in fact the same .",
    "we consider the action of @xmath2556 , for example .",
    "the @xmath2433$]-module associated to the equivalence class of @xmath2450 is the same as that of @xmath2557 .",
    "but their contributions in differ by a sign since @xmath2556 takes conjugation at @xmath2558 places . the claim is proved in this case .    from now on",
    ", we assume that @xmath2559 .",
    "we will have to do an explicit computation .",
    "for @xmath2560 , we consider the following set of operators @xmath2561 and let @xmath2562 denote the subgroup generated by @xmath2563 .",

    "it is not hard to see that , for each @xmath3 , @xmath2566 consist of exactly those @xmath2550 such that @xmath2569 .",
    "put @xmath2570 and @xmath2571 for @xmath2572 , and let @xmath2573 $ ] denote the associated set of equivalence classes .",
    "thus @xmath2574 consists of exactly those cyclic words @xmath2550 such that @xmath2575 , and we have @xmath2545=\\bigcup_{k=0}^{t'}[{\\mathrm{ob}}_{k}^{\\circ}]$ ] .",
    "it is clear that the cardinalities of these sets are @xmath2576    we first look at the contribution from @xmath2577 $ ] to the sum .",
    "the equivalent class @xmath2567 corresponds to a representation @xmath2433/(\\phi^{\\tilde r } - \\lambda)$ ] for some @xmath2578 .",

    "the change of the sign is a result of the last rule in .",
    "we note moreover that any two cyclic words in @xmath2582 are not equivalent unless they are equal .",

    "since every @xmath2587 elements in @xmath2588 give rise to one equivalence class in @xmath2589 $ ] , we see that the multiplicities of the two representations above given by @xmath2589 $ ] are @xmath2590 and @xmath2591 respectively .    for @xmath2592 ,",
