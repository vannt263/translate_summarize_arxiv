    "the gravitational lens system q0957 + 561 ( walsh , carswell , & weymann 1979 ) has been modeled extensively in an effort to determine the hubble constant @xmath5 from measurements of the time delay between its two primary images . since the long - running dispute over the time delay measurement has been resolved in favor of the short delay ( schild & thomson 1997 ; haarsma _ et al_. 1997 , 1998 ; kundi _ et al_. 1997 ) , the largest remaining uncertainty arises from the mass model .",
    "the lens consists of a cluster with a large central elliptical galaxy g1 .",
    "the asymmetric radial positions of the images accurately constrain the parameterized radial mass distribution of g1 ( grogin & narayan 1996 , hereafter gn ) .",
    "however , the presence of the cluster introduces a degeneracy in the overall mass normalization of g1 ( falco , gorenstein , & shapiro 1985 ; gorenstein , falco , & shapiro 1988 ) , and thus in the determination of the hubble constant ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a velocity dispersion characterizing the mass of g1 ) .",
    "therefore , additional independent constraints are needed on the relative contributions of g1 and the cluster to the @xmath8 image separation .",
    "these can be obtained by inferring _",
    "the mass of the cluster _ from cluster dynamics ( garrett , walsh , & carswell 1992 ; angonin - willaime , soucail , & vanderriest 1994 ) , from hot intracluster gas x - ray emission ( chartas _ et al_. 1995 , 1998 ) , or from the weak lensing of background galaxies ( dahle , maddox , & lilje 1994 ; fischer _ et al_. 1997 ) .",
    "alternatively , one can infer _ the mass of g1 _ from stellar dynamical measurements .",
    "the quadruple lens pg 1115 + 080 ( weymann _ et al_. 1980 ) is the second system with a well - determined time delay ( schechter _ et al_. 1997 ; barkana 1997b ) .",
    "the projected mass of the primary lens galaxy g inside the ring of images can be precisely determined ( unlike the case of q0957 + 561 , uncertainties in the mass distribution of nearby galaxies have only a minor effect on the models ) .",
    "however , the geometry of the system does not permit distinguishing between different mass profiles .",
    "this has important consequences for the hubble constant , since @xmath5 can vary by 40% , depending on the mass model assumed ( see keeton & kochanek 1997 ; courbin _ et al_. 1997 ; saha & williams 1997 ; impey _ et al_. 1998 ) .",
    "stellar dynamical measurements of g may be helpful for breaking the degeneracy in the mass model , and thus in @xmath5 .",
    "falco _ et al_. ( 1997 ) measured the central projected stellar velocity dispersion of q0957 + 561 g1 to be @xmath9 km s@xmath4 , improving on an earlier measurement by rhee ( 1991 ) . similarly , tonry ( 1998 ) measured the central dispersion of pg 1115 + 080 g to be @xmath10 km s@xmath4 .",
    "however , the conversion of the measured @xmath11 to @xmath7 is subject to systematic uncertainties , which include the unknown anisotropy structure of the stellar orbits , the radial variation of the mass - to - light ratio , and the ellipticity of the galaxy .",
    "previous galaxy models have arrived at a relatively small uncertainty in this conversion by making arbitrary simplifying assumptions .",
    "kochanek ( 1993 , 1994 ) considered a singular isothermal mass model with constant anisotropy . for q0957 + 561 ,",
    "gn used these dynamical models , but limited them to be nearly isotropic , leading to a 2% systematic uncertainty in @xmath12 ( and thus in @xmath5 ) .",
    "barkana ( 1997a ) also assumed near - isotropic orbits , leading to an uncertainty in @xmath5 of 4% , but he noted that allowing for more anisotropy gives an uncertainty of 14% .",
    "in fact , dynamical studies of nearby elliptical galaxies have clearly demonstrated that there is little basis for the assumption of isotropy , or even of constant anisotropy .",
    "binney & mamon ( 1982 ) and tonry ( 1983 ) first illustrated that an elliptical galaxy s surface brightness and projected stellar velocity dispersion profiles , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , could not determine both its mass distribution and its anisotropy profile .",
    "richstone & tremaine ( 1984 ) and katz & richstone ( 1985 ) used orbit modeling methods to demonstrate that the conversion from the dispersion profile @xmath14 to a mass parameter @xmath12 can be uncertain by an order of magnitude .",
    "further theoretical studies ( dejonghe 1987 ; merritt 1987 ; merrifield & kent 1990 ; gerhard 1991 ; dejonghe & merritt 1992 ; merritt & saha 1993 ; merritt 1993 ) demonstrated that _ complete _ knowledge of the stellar line - of - sight velocity distribution ( losvd ) @xmath15 gives a unique solution for the two - integral distribution function ( df ) @xmath16 in a known spherical potential @xmath17 , and may even strongly constrain an unknown @xmath17 .",
    "the general efficacy of _ incomplete _ knowledge of @xmath18 is less clear , but important constraints on @xmath19 and @xmath17 could be further provided by large - radius measurements of higher - order velocity moments ( _ e.g. _ , the gauss - hermite moments @xmath20  van der marel & franx 1993 ; gerhard 1993 ; see also rix & white 1992 ; zhao & prada 1996 ) .",
    "et al_. ( 1997 ) and gerhard _ et al_. ( 1998 ) made dynamical fits to nearby galaxies with higher - order moments ( @xmath21 ) measured to @xmath22 ; they determined the total mass to @xmath23 10 - 15% , and ruled out a constant mass - to - light ratio with @xmath24 confidence .",
    "for the galaxy ngc 2434 , the solutions typically had nearly constant radial anisotropy @xmath25 , while ngc 6703 showed an anisotropy rising from @xmath26 at the center to @xmath27 near @xmath28 .",
    "_ thus the assumption of @xmath29 , or even of constant @xmath30 , is certainly unwarranted and probably incorrect . _",
    "while our current knowledge of elliptical galaxies does not permit us to make arbitrary assumptions about the anisotropy of the df , we can impose the constraint that the unmeasured @xmath14 and @xmath31 profiles of these lens galaxies are similar to those of other galaxies ( provided they are universally homologous ) . in this study",
    "we rigorously consider the utility of the central @xmath11 measurement for determining @xmath5 from these two lens systems . to ensure physically correct , robust results , we use a spherical orbit modeling method after schwarzschild ( 1979 ) , richstone & tremaine ( 1984 ) , and rix _",

    "2 we review the observational constraints on the lens galaxies , and introduce constraints on their losvd profiles by demonstrating that the profiles of nearby elliptical galaxies are self - similar . we describe our modeling method and demonstrate it with a test - case problem in  3 . in  4 , we report the range of model solutions for q0957 + 561 , and discuss the implications for @xmath5 .",

    ", a simple measurement of the central projected stellar velocity dispersion @xmath11 can not strongly constrain the mass of a lens galaxy , necessitating further _ a priori _ constraints . however , rather than making unjustified assumptions about the galaxy s anisotropy , we impose conditions on its observable properties by requiring it to have an losvd profile consistent with those of better - observed galaxies . to this end",

    "a perfectly gaussian profile will have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for spherical systems , the fourth moment @xmath0 is a useful constraint on the df ; its value is typically positive ( peaked losvd ) if @xmath19 is radially anisotropic , and negative ( flat - topped losvd ) if tangentially anisotropic . strictly speaking ,",
    "since we apply the data to non - rotating models , we should use the gauss - hermite moment @xmath40",

    "if there proves to be a universal shape to these profiles ( _ i.e. _ , there is little scatter between galaxies ) , we can use them as additional constraints ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "accurate observations of q0957 + 561 g1 are difficult because of the nearby bright quasar image , but measurements have been made of the stellar surface brightness profile @xmath13 and the central velocity dispersion @xmath11 .",
    "bernstein , tyson , & kochanek ( 1993 ) measured @xmath41 along the major axis ( @xmath42 25 - 183 ) in the @xmath43-band , and bernstein _ et al_. ( 1997 ) measured it at smaller radii ( @xmath42 01 - 57 ) in the @xmath44-band .",
    "the galaxy is rather round , with an ellipticity increasing with radius ( @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) .",
    "we combine the @xmath43 and @xmath44 data , assuming a simple offset of 1.34 magnitudes , and map the data to the intermediate radius @xmath47 , resulting in a profile @xmath48 with @xmath49 01 - 128 , where @xmath50 45 . to ensure a reasonable @xmath48 profile , we also impose weak constraints at large and small radii , resulting in 50 data points over the range @xmath49 00 - 294 .",

    "their data suggest a rise in the dispersion at the center , with @xmath52 km s@xmath4 inside 02 , and @xmath53 km s@xmath4 outside 02 .",
    "since such a rise is inconsistent with the radial dispersion profiles of nearby galaxies and with the subsequent dispersion measurements of tonry & franx ( 1998 ) , we adopt the total binned measurement of 279 km s@xmath4 .",
    "grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) modeled the lensing properties of q0957 + 561 , using two different parametric mass models for g1 .",

    "their best - fit parameters are ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , at 2 @xmath2 ) , where the deflection parameter @xmath58 is related to the central density @xmath59 . this best - fit model is a poor fit to the data ( @xmath60 per degree of freedom of 6.9 ) , and uses a position for g1 that has been shown to be incorrect ( bernstein _ et al . _ 1997 ) . but for want of a reanalysis of the lensing constraints , we will adopt this solution in our models .",
    "impey _ et al_. ( 1998 ) found that the galaxy pg 1115 + 080 g is nearly circular , and fit well by a de vaucouleurs profile with @xmath61 .",
    "we approximate the surface brightness of this galaxy by a hernquist ( 1990 ) model with a break radius of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , modeled as a profile @xmath48 with 21 bins over the range @xmath49 00 - 21 .",

    "to make a scale - free comparison of the profiles , we renormalize to the central @xmath76 ( inside @xmath80 , for direct comparison with the central @xmath11 measurement of q0957 + 561 g1 ; or inside @xmath81 for pg 1115 + 080 g ) , and rescale radially by @xmath28 .",

    "the losvd is everywhere consistent with gaussianity ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "because our mean profiles are derived from a general data set of elliptical galaxies , they may not accurately represent a brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) like q0957 + 561 g1 . to gauge the magnitude of any systematic errors thereby caused , we repeat our procedure with 42 velocity profiles from a set of 12 bcgs from fisher _ et al_. ( 1995 ) , who find that the radial slopes of @xmath11 are similar to those of a sample of normal elliptical galaxies .",

    "( 1997 ) , and density parameter @xmath163 , the gn results imply @xmath164 km s@xmath4 and @xmath165 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 . our dynamical constraints on @xmath7 therefore put 1-@xmath2 constraints on @xmath161 of @xmath166 , implying @xmath167 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ; and 2-@xmath2 constraints of @xmath168 , implying @xmath3 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "note that tonry & franx ( 1998 ) measured a central velocity dispersion for g1 of @xmath169 km s@xmath4 ; although their aperture is different from that used in our dynamical models , their measurement would roughly imply @xmath170 and @xmath171 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .    for comparison ,",
    "we examine complementary studies of this system .",
    "fischer _ et al_. ( 1997 ) used the weak lensing of background galaxies to determine the surface density @xmath172 of the cluster . using their parameterized model fit to @xmath173 and their stated uncertainties , we find 1-@xmath2 constraints on the convergence @xmath161 of @xmath174 , and 2-@xmath2 bounds of ( 0.06 - 1.00 ) .",
    "similarly , kundi _ et al_. ( 1997 ) estimated @xmath175 ( 2 @xmath2 ) from this data , but they neglected the uncertainties in the cluster position . note that these estimates of @xmath161 were derived with the cluster centered on the galaxy g1 , rather than at the real mass centroid of the cluster , and also that the proximity of the cluster to g1 invalidates the description of the potential as simply a convergence @xmath161 and a shear @xmath176 ( see kochanek 1991 ) .",
    "et al_. ( 1997 ) also warn that an error in the assumed mean redshift of the background galaxies can affect the derived @xmath5 significantly . with these _ caveats _ in mind , we find that the 1-@xmath2 values for @xmath161 from the fischer _",
    "et al_. ( 1997 ) models imply @xmath177 km s@xmath4 for the best - fit gn model , and @xmath178 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( see fig .",
    "7 ) . in a complementary study , chartas _ et al_. ( 1998 ) determined the mass of the cluster from its gaseous x - ray emission .",
    "their results imply @xmath179 , @xmath180 km s@xmath4 , and @xmath181 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( 2 @xmath2 ) , but they include no estimate of their systematic uncertainties .",
    "both of these direct constraints on @xmath161 are consistent with the constraints implied by our dynamical models of g1 , and could in principle be combined with them to further constrain @xmath5 , though they are currently too uncertain to add any useful information .",
    "so we find that the gn lens model , combined with the dispersion measurement of g1 , permits a determination of @xmath5 to 16% accuracy .",
    "although better lens models may significantly shift the best - fit @xmath5 value , they will have little effect on the uncertainties , which are dominated by the uncertainty in @xmath161 ; we have already assumed a perfect determination of the parameters ( @xmath182 , @xmath183 ) from the gn models , and a perfect determination of @xmath58 would tighten the 1-@xmath2 limits on @xmath5 by only @xmath184 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 . to find @xmath5 to significantly better accuracy from this system",
    ", we would need much better direct constraints on the cluster mass distribution , and/or highly accurate velocity data from the galaxy at larger radii .",
    "we next model the galaxy g in pg 1115 + 080 to determine if the different lens mass profiles explored by impey _ et al_. ( 1998 ) are consistent with the measurements by impey _",
    "et al_. ( 1998 ) of @xmath13 and by tonry ( 1998 ) of the central @xmath11 ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "if any mass model can be ruled out , so can its corresponding value of @xmath5 .",
    "as in the case of q0957 + 561 , a single central @xmath11 measurement will give us little information about the galaxy mass profile , so we again impose mean profile constraints on @xmath32 and @xmath31 , normalized to this galaxy ( see  2.2 ) .",
    "we fit a singular isothermal mass model to these data , and although we have not exhaustively explored the entire range of possible solutions , we estimate the projected mass inside @xmath70 to be @xmath185 , which is consistent with the lens model s implied @xmath186 ( for the case where the nearby galaxy group is modeled as a singular isothermal sphere ) .",
    "similarly , we fit the modified hubble model and find @xmath187 , which is consistent with the lens model fit mass . to test the constant mass - to - light ratio hypothesis , we fit a hernquist ( 1990 ) model with a break radius of @xmath62 ( to match the measured effective radius of @xmath188 ) , and find @xmath189 , which is also consistent with the lens model fit mass .",
    "our dynamical models are also consistent with the lens model results when the group is modeled as a point mass , in which case @xmath190 . to compare the relative likelihood of the three mass models , we impose the lens model mass normalization on each of them , and find that our dynamical solutions are statistically indistinguishable ( @xmath158 ) .    with the measured time delay ( schechter _",
    "et al_. 1997 ; barkana 1997b ) , for @xmath163 and a singular isothermal group model , the singular isothermal galaxy model gives @xmath191 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ; the modified hubble profile model , @xmath192 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ; and the constant @xmath193 model , @xmath194 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ( impey _ et al_. 1998 ) . treating the group as a point mass increases @xmath5 by @xmath195 . since our stellar dynamical models do not rule out any of the lens models , a large range of values for @xmath5 is still permitted by the system . as in the case of q0957 + 561 , stronger constraints on the mass distribution of the system ( e.g. , from losvd measurements of the lens galaxy , or from more detailed observations of the einstein ring )",
    "will be necessary to break the model degeneracies .",
    "using very general orbit modeling methods , we have examined the uncertainty in the mass of the lens galaxies q0957 + 561 g1 and pg 1115 + 080 g , given observations of their central projected stellar velocity dispersions @xmath11 ( falco _ et al .",
    "_ 1997 ; tonry 1998 ) .",
    "as many past studies have shown , such a measurement alone is inadequate to strongly constrain the galaxy s mass . in order to put additional realistic _ a priori _ constraints on the galaxy s properties ,",
    "we have derived `` mean profiles '' of the rms projected velocity @xmath32 and the fourth - order gauss - hermite moment @xmath31 from a large sample of nearby elliptical galaxies .",
    "these mean profiles prove to be remarkably self - similar , even over a large range of galaxy types .",
    "this universality is not too surprising , given the homology of early - type galaxies implied by the existence of the fundamental plane  an even stronger implication if the central kinetic energy is considered instead of the velocity dispersion ( _ e.g. _ , busarello _",
    "et al_. 1997 ) .    for q0957",
    "+ 561 g1 , given the best - fit spls mass model from grogin & narayan ( 1996 ) , with only the surface brightness profile @xmath13 and central @xmath11 as constraints , we find 1-@xmath2 limits on the mass dispersion @xmath7 of @xmath196 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the addition of the mean profile constraints reduces this permitted range to @xmath150 km s@xmath4 . in conjunction with the gn lens model constraints , this implies a cluster convergence of @xmath197 , which is consistent with the constraints on @xmath161 from other independent studies . using the time delay measurement of kundi _",
    "et al_. ( 1997 ) , we find 1-@xmath2 limits on @xmath5 of @xmath198 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , and 2-@xmath2 limits of @xmath199 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 .",
    "_ thus , current measurements of the lens system q0957 + 561 do not constrain @xmath5 to better than 15% . _ to obtain useful limits on @xmath5 , we will need better constraints on the cluster convergence and/or better velocity profile measurements for the galaxy g1 .",
    "we will also need substantial revision of the lens model  the gn solutions fit the lens data poorly , inaccurately assume a spherical galaxy , and use an oversimplified taylor expansion model of the cluster .",
    "presumably a more accurate lens model will eventually provide a good fit to the data and a different value for @xmath5 ( see barkana _ et al_. 1998 for some improved models ) , in which case our dynamical model will still be illustrative of the systematic uncertainties expected .",
    "we have also examined the lens galaxy pg 1115 + 080 g , which has a total mass that is relatively well - determined by the lensing constraints , but a radial mass distribution that is unconstrained ( impey _ et al_. 1998 ) . as with q0957 + 561 g1 , we model this galaxy by including constraints on @xmath13 and the central @xmath11 along with the mean profile constraints . we find that these constraints are not sufficient to break the degeneracy between the different lens models , so that a large range of values is still permitted for @xmath5 ( 44 - 68 km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 ) .",
    "further constraints on the mass distribution in this system are needed .",
    "the stellar dynamics of gravitational lens systems show considerable promise for determining @xmath5 , even if we have only central dispersions .",
    "larger samples of dispersion measurements would be particularly valuable , since each lens system will have a different set of systematic uncertainties ( it is encouraging to note that the results for @xmath5 from q0957 + 561 and pg 1115 + 080 are so far consistent with each other ) .",
    "of particular value would be results from isolated systems with lens geometries that probe the radial mass distribution , such as mg 1654 + 1346 ( see ellithorpe , kochanek , & hewitt 1996 ) and mg 1549 + 3047 ( lehr _ et al_. 1993 , 1996 ) .",
    "the results from a large set of these systems could be combined using bayesian methods to converge on a robust value for @xmath5 ( see press 1997 ) , avoiding the correlated systematic uncertainties that plague `` distance ladder '' approaches .",
    "furthermore , the independent measurement of galaxy properties from gravitational lensing and from stellar dynamics has an enormous potential for shedding light on the detailed structure of galaxies .",

    "we also thank norm grogin for many further demonstrations of his lens models .",
