    "in the fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) , the hall conductivity @xmath6 , measured as a function of the magnetic field @xmath7 , reveals plateaus at some fractional values of the filling factor @xcite .",
    "a similar behavior of @xmath6 at integer filling factors is known as the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe ) @xcite . however , after the work of laughlin @xcite , it became clear that in the fqhe , in contrast to the iqhe , electron - electron interactions play an important part .",
    "an essential advance in understanding of the fqhe was reached through the composite - fermion concept @xcite , further developed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the filling factor @xmath8 . there",
    ", the problem of a two - dimensional ( 2d ) interacting electron gas in a strong perpendicular magnetic field was reduced to the investigation of composite fermions in an effective magnetic field . since",
    "exactly at @xmath8 the field is gauged out , composite fermions were assumed to form a fermi liquid .",
    "such a system should , in an effective magnetic field , exhibit the de haas - shubnikov effect , the extreme form of which is the iqhe .",
    "thus , the fractional hall plateaus of the original electron system were interpreted as the integer ones of the transformed fermions .",
    "however , the question crucial for such an approach , whether a 2d system of fermions in a magnetic field can indeed be treated in the framework of the usual fermi - liquid theory , deserves a thorough investigation .",
    "the concept of the fermi liquid makes it possible to pass from interacting fermions to non - interacting quasiparticles @xcite .",
    "the analysis in refs .",
    "@xcite shows that interacting three - dimensional ( 3d ) electrons in a sufficiently weak magnetic field can be described essentially as the ideal fermi gas , after one changes all the properties of particles of the ideal fermi gas to those of quasiparticles . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy spectrum of a noninteracting 2d electron gas in a perpendicular magnetic field is known to consist of discrete and dispersionless landau levels ( ll s ) .",
    "the renormalization of this spectrum should differ drastically from that in the 3d case and in systems with dispersion in the spectrum .",
    "the reason is that the ll s of noninteracting 2d electrons in a magnetic field are highly degenerate .",
    "according to the basic concepts of quantum mechanics , even weak interactions between the particles , can lift this degeneracy , sometimes resulting in nontrivial structures of the renormalized ll s .",
    "thus , the singularity in the density of states in 2d is reflected also in other physical quantities , whereas the singularity in 3d is smoothed because of the presence of the third momentum along the direction of the magnetic field .",
    "more rigorously , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the self - energy part of the one - particle green function @xmath9 depends on the magnetic field @xmath7 not only via the usual operator @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vector potential of the magnetic field , but also via a contribution of the order @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the spatial dimension of the system , the cyclotron frequency @xmath14 , and @xmath15 is the fermi energy . for @xmath16 and a weak magnetic field ,",
    "the contribution of the second kind is small and could be disregarded in comparison with the first one , which is of the order of @xmath17 . for a 2d system ,",
    "both terms are equally important and the applicability of the fermi - liquid description in a weak magnetic field is questionable . to check this , we will find all essential contributions to @xmath9 and obtain the renormalized spectrum .    some insight into the problems discussed above can be obtained with the help of a rather simple model of interparticle interactions . in this paper , the case of short - range ( contact ) interactions is considered . an analogous analysis for such interactions",
    "was already performed for a 3d electron gas @xcite , for a 3d electron gas in a weak magnetic field @xcite , and for a 2d electron gas @xcite .",
    "all these systems are examples of the traditional landau fermi liquid .",
    "the question whether the fermi - liquid theory is appropriate for the description of the 2d electron gas with contact interparticle interactions in a weak magnetic field , was investigated for the case of @xmath18 completely filled ll s @xcite .",
    "the number @xmath18 is determined by the fermi energy @xmath15 , @xmath19 . for a field @xmath7 ( or density of electrons @xmath20 ) , such that the upper ll @xmath18 is only partly filled , its filling factor @xmath21 , the problem is still open .",
    "the case of incomplete filling is very interesting from the experimental point of view as well as for theoretical study . in the present work ,",
    "we investigate how a deviation of @xmath0 from unity changes the spectrum of the interacting system , treating @xmath22 as a small parameter .",
    "we find the spectrum for two regimes . in the first regime , where @xmath23 , a splitting of the ll s occurs . in the second regime , where @xmath24 , the splitting is accompanied by a shift of the zeeman - split ll s .",
    "the intermediate case @xmath5 is the most complex and we were not able to study it .",
    "the renormalization of the spectrum has an unusual character , compared with all known cases .",
    "such features of the bare spectrum , as the absence of dispersion and the equal spacing between the neighbouring landau levels , lead to resonances which _ split _ the bare spectrum .",
    "the renormalization of the zeeman - split ll s by long - range coulomb interactions is a well - known effect for strong @xcite and intermediate @xcite magnetic fields .",
    "this result is of a similar origin with the second regime , being a manifestation of the asymmetry in interactions of particles having opposite spin projections with the electrons from the fermi sphere .",
    "it is noteworthy that there is a certain similarity between the renormalization in our system and that of fermion systems with a dispersion in the bare spectrum : we will find criteria which determine when the system under consideration belongs to fermi liquids .",
    "they provide conditions for the bare spectrum near the ll @xmath18 to be weakly renormalized , so that classification of the ll s according to their indices is preserved , i.e. the ll s do not overlap with each other .",
    "the spectrum obtained shows that electron - electron interactions do not break the translational symmetry and thus partially preserve the initial degeneracy of the spectrum .",
    "in contrast , introducing impurities into the sample leads to a broadening of the bare ll s and the formation of bands of delocalized states @xcite .    it is worth mentioning that in our work , we study the spectrum of quasiparticle - type excitations whose physical properties",
    "are strongly affected by electron - electron interactions .",
    "quantities like the heat capacity and the spin paramagnetism are sensitive to it . in contrast , the cyclotron effective mass and the zero - field plasma frequency are not changed by these interactions @xcite .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the model . in section iii , we detect the effect of splitting , crucial for our system , within second order of perturbation theory .",
    "then , with the aid of general rules formulated in section iv , we select important diagrams for the ll s in section v. in sections vi and vii , respectively , the renormalization of ll s near and further away from the ll @xmath18 is studied .",

    "we consider the hamiltonian @xmath25 where the hamiltonian of the noninteracting electrons ( apart from the zeeman term ) , @xmath26 , is given by @xmath27 ^ 2\\,\\hat{\\psi}_\\sigma({\\bf r } ) \\label{a2 }   \\ ; . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",

    "for example , for the case of complete filling ( @xmath57 ) , each spin - split ll is either filled or not , so there exists a spin symmetry . it is obvious that in this case , all the effects of electron - electron interactions can not depend on spin either .",
