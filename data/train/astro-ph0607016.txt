    "they also assume that the convection occurs on scales small compared to the perturbation , and further that the convection is approximately incompressible and isentropic . assuming that the convective length scales are small compared to the perturbation allowed them to consider a volume small enough to accommodate all convective scales , but over that volume the perturbation velocity field can be assumed linear in the cartesian coordinates ( @xmath11 ) : @xmath12 in other words we define the matrix @xmath13 as the derivative matrix of @xmath10 : @xmath14 and keep only the first term in the taylor series of @xmath10 .",
    "+ under this assumption means the results will only be applicable to perturbations that are large compared to the size of the simulation domain . in particular",
    "this prevents us from making any statements about the 5 minute solar oscillations , because the penetration depth of those is less than the box we use , and the coarse resolution prevent us from looking at only the upper part of the box .",
    "+ assuming incompressible and isentropic convection allows one to use the eulerian equations for fluid motion : @xmath15 where @xmath16 incorporates pressure and gravitational acceleration , assumed to be gradients of scalar fields .",
    "+ the problem has two dimensionless parameters : the tidal strain @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the frequency of the perturbation and @xmath20 .",

    "all of the above quantities are in fourier space , because there the incompressibility is simply imposed by the projection operator : @xmath27 eq . [ eq : delta v ] can then be used to express the energy dissipation rate again as a power series in the two dimensionless quantities .",

    "[ fig : scalings]b shows that all the diagonal components scale roughly the same way with frequency and are dominated by the z - z component , although not by that dramatic a difference .",

    "the best fit slope for our curve ( not shown ) is : @xmath39 regardless whether we do the fit in linear or logarithmic space .",
    "+ what are the possible sources of error in this result ?",
    "firstly we have assumed an incompressible flow in order to simplify the treatment .",
    "however , the fluid simulations used are not incompressible , because at the top of the convection zone , where most of the driving of the convection occurs , the flow velocities reach very close to the speed of sound and hence the flow is necessarily compressible . however , even though that layer is extremely important for the flow established below , it only contributes insignifficantly to the turbullent dissipation , because it only contains a few percent of the total mass . to verify that only a small fraction mass lies in a compressible region for each grid point , we define a compressibility parameter @xmath40 , where @xmath23 is the eddy turnover time in our box . in fig . [",
    "fig : m(xi ) ] we plot the mass fraction with @xmath41 less than certain value .",
    "it is clear that the incompressibility assumption is violated only for a negligible fraction of the mass . as we noted before the flow is compressible only near the top of the box . to confirm that the presence of this region does not signifficantly affect our results we repeated the analysis separately for the top and bottom halves of the simulation box .",
    "the two new scalings obtained this way were completely consistent with the scaling of viscosity with frequency for the entire box .",
    "+     less than the given value .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    next , the fact that we have a finite ( small ) portion of the convection zone , both in time and in space could be important .",
    "we only treat the top portion of the solar convection zone and hope that the result is not very sensitive to depth . of course it would be ideal to have the entire depth of the convection zone covered , but with current computational resources this is way outside of reach . + the finite span of the simulations may also be introducing edge effects which can be treated by applying some sort of a window function .",
    "we tried welch , bartlett and square window ( no window ) . to verify that the time window available is large enough , we tried ignoring the last approximately @xmath42 of the data .",
    "we carried all those test on two independent runs of the model . the slopes this produced ranged from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , where most of the difference originated from the two independent runs .",
    "+ in addition the finite resolution might be leading to aliasing that could change our result .",
    "in particular make it flatter than it really is , by basically dumping additional power to the frequencies for which the dissipation is smallest ( the places with higher value of the dissipation are less likely to be affected significantly ) .",
    "the effects of this can be seen in the diagonal viscosity components .",
    "the tails of their curves become flatter toward the end .",
    "the fact that this is restricted to the end of the curves is encouraging as it suggests only the high frequency end of the curve is affected .",
    "also we have looked at crossections of the fourier transformed velocity field and they do tail off at high @xmath45 , which gives us confidence that the resolution is sufficient to capture most of the spectral power and that aliasing effects will be small .",
    "+ finally there are statistical errors associated with every point .",
    "those can be estimated by noting the difference between @xmath46 and @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings]b .",
    "physically one expects that there should be no differences between the two horizontal directions of the simulation box , so the differences between them is some sort of measure of the error . in particular from there one can see that the first few points ( at the low frequency end ) are significantly less reliable than the rest , but apart from the first few points those errors become small .",
    "the average fractional uncertainty is @xmath48 , which leads to an overall error in the slope of @xmath49 .",
    "+ abandoning the kolmogorov picture of turbullence clearly has a large effect on the result .",
    "even though we use the approach of goodman & oh , which gives a power law index of @xmath50 for a kolmogorov turbulence , our results give a scaling , rather different from the previous prescriptions .",
    "we also find that the viscosity is no longer isotropic .",
    "this is due to the signifficant difference in scaling between the velocity power spectrum with frequency and wavenumber in our simulation and the kolmogorov prescription ( see fig . [",
    "fig : power spectra ] ) .",
    "there are two important distictions apparent .",
    "first the frequency spectrum of our box is much shallower than the kolmogorov prescription .",
    "this is responsible for the slower loss of efficiency of viscosity with frequency that we observe .",
    "second the radial direction is clearly very different from the two horizontal directions  @xmath51 and @xmath52behave very differently from @xmath53 and the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath54 and @xmath55 is different from the @xmath56 dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power spectra ] a , b )  of course this results in the anisotropy of the viscosity tensor we calculate .",
    "even though the spatial dependence of the horizontal velocity components is much different from the radial velocity spatial dependence , the frequency power spectrum of all three components scales roughly like @xmath57 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : power spectra]c ) . from eq .",
    "[ eq : e dot full ] we see that if all the components of @xmath9 have the same scaling with frequency , that same scaling will also apply for the viscosity , which is indeed what we observe .",

    "our result is somewhat unexpected .",
    "it apparently stems from the fact that the structure of the convection velocity field produced by the 3d simulations is very different from simple isotropic kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the picture that emerges from these simulations consists of large scale slow up - flows penetrated by relatively fast and very localized down - drafts that are coherent over a signifficant portion of the simulation box and persistent for extended periods of time .",
    "this is what causes the anisotropy and also seems to conspire to change the scaling with frequency , and make it relatively flat .",
    "this makes our results appear closer to zahn s prescription , which is coincidental , given the different physical assumptions .",
    "the question of what exactly is the reason for the shallower frequency dependence of the dissipation is of course a very interesting one .",
    "however , using a perturbative approach , limits us in our ability to answer it . to properly address this question one would need to create a consistent hydrodynamical simulation that allows for the perturbation velocity field to be put directly into the equations of motion and not treated by a perturbative approach after the fact",
    "this would also address the question of whether the expansion is actually converging and if taking the first nonzero term is a good approximation , which is currently only our hope .",
    "this enhanced dissipation is in better agreement with data on the circularization of the orbits of sun - like main sequence stars , and the location of the instability strip as discussed earlier .",
    "we currently can not make any statements about the dissipation of p - modes , because those do not satisfy the assumption of linearity and incompressibility of the perturbation velocity over the simulation box .",
    "however , we have used a solar 3d convection simulation which is consistent with the solar p - mode spectrum . + note",
    "that our approach here is more appropriate to tides raised by a planet on a slow ( non - synchronized ) star ( sasselov 2003 ) .",
    "the problem of binary stars circularization will require a detailed treatment and understanding of the feedback on the convection zone .",
    "on the other hand , the tidal dissipation in fast - rotating fully - convective planets and stars might be dominated by inertial waves ( wu 2004ab , ogilvie & lin 2004 ) .",
    "they are sensitive to turbulent viscosity however , and the linear scaling has a strong effect on their dissipation ( wu 2004b ) .",
