    "the search for supersymmetric ( susy ) particles is one of the major issues in particle physics today@xcite .",
    "direct searches for susy particles at the lep @xmath12 collider have led to mass bounds@xcite , @xmath13 where prospects for higher mass searches are linked to increases in beam energy . at hadron colliders ,",
    "most searches have focussed on gluino and squark production ; here , the cdf and d0 experiments have obtained mass limits of@xcite @xmath14 based on non - observation of events with missing transverse energy ( @xmath15 ) plus jets above expected background levels .",
    "recently , much attention has focussed on the clean trilepton signal from @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "one expects events containing three hard , isolated leptons plus @xmath15 with jet activity only from qcd radiation ; standard model ( sm ) backgrounds are expected to be tiny . the importance of this signature has been pointed out long ago for _ on shell _ @xmath19 decays@xcite ; it was then pointed out that the total @xmath20 cross section remains substantial even for _ off - shell _",
    "@xmath19 decays@xcite , so that the trilepton signal may be observable with an accumulated data sample of @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that there could be a large enhancement of the trilepton signal@xcite , especially when @xmath23 as is the case in the `` no - scale '' limit of supergravity ( sugra ) models .",
    "in favorable cases , given sufficient luminosity , it may be possible for tevatron @xmath24 collider experiments to probe chargino masses even beyond the reach of lep 200 , corresponding to gluino masses in the several hundred gev region .",
    "this has since been confirmed by calculations of the trilepton rate within the no - scale flipped @xmath25 supergravity framework@xcite .",
    "detailed simulation of the trilepton signal and background have been carried out in ref.@xcite , where the importance of the dilepton invariant mass distribution was stressed for obtaining a measurement of @xmath11 .",
    "very recently , the cdf@xcite and d0@xcite collaborations have reported preliminary bounds on @xmath26 from a non - observation of trilepton events in their analysis of @xmath27 of their data . although these analyses do not ( yet )",
    "significantly improve on the bounds from lep , they clearly establish the viability of this signature .",
    "the higher energy ( @xmath28 tev ) and higher luminosity ( @xmath29@xmath30 ) anticipated for the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) project should substantially increase the range of parameter space to be probed via the clean trilepton signal .",
    "this was first examined in ref.@xcite , and later in greater detail , by barbieri _ et . al._@xcite .",
    "these authors@xcite warned that at the lhc the sm background from @xmath31 production  largely negligible at tevatron energies  may remain problematic ( owing to the large top pair total cross section ) , especially if @xmath32 was around 120130 gev .",
    "for example , in going from tevatron to lhc colliders , the @xmath20 production cross section increases by a factor of @xmath33 , while total @xmath34 background cross section ( @xmath35 gev ) increases by a factor of @xmath36 . in their study , however , they had assumed that the branching fractions for neutralinos were the same as those of the @xmath4 boson which , as we have mentioned , often leads to an underestimate of the signal . on the other hand , when probing higher mass scales associated with the lhc , possible new chargino and neutralino decay modes may open up , leading to loss of signal .",
    "it is also possible that other chargino and neutralino reactions , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath37 production , become accessible at the larger lhc energy and also contribute to the signal .",
    "finally , if @xmath20 events can be isolated from other sources of trileptons , the high event rate expected may allow for substantial precision in the @xmath11 mass measurement , assuming a signal is found .    in this paper , we seek to answer the following questions :    1 .   can one find a set of cuts to allow a signal to be claimed above sm backgrounds ? 2 .",
    "if so , in what regions of parameter space is a signal likely observable ?",
    "is it possible to separate the trilepton signal from direct chargino - neutralino production from the same signal coming from the cascade decays of gluinos and squarks ? 4 .",
    "can one gain information on the chargino and neutralino masses ?    to answer these , we perform detailed simulations of signal and background using isajet 7.07@xcite . in sec .",
    "ii , we present an overview of total production cross sections , relevant branching fractions , and details of our simulation . in sec .",
    "iii , we try to find an optimal set of cuts to enhance signal over background , and we outline the regions of parameter space where a detectable signal can be expected at the lhc .",
    "we study strategies for extracting information about chargino and neutralino masses in sec .",
    "we show that for regions of parameters where @xmath38 or @xmath39 decays are kinematically inaccessible , it should be possible to obtain @xmath11 with reasonable precision .",
    "we also discuss the possibility of other mass measurements .",
    "we conclude in sec .",
    "v with discussion of our results .",
    "we work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm)@xcite , which is the simplest supersymmetric extension of the sm .",
    "our mssm mass and parameter choices are inspired , but not ruled by , supergravity models with electroweak symmetry breaking : in particular , we take the higgsino mass parameter @xmath40 as a free parameter , although it usually scales with @xmath6 , in sugra models@xcite with radiative breaking of electroweak symmetry . in minimal supergravity models ,",
    "supersymmetry breaking leads to a common mass for sfermions at the unification scale .",
    "the degeneracy of sfermions present at the unification scale is broken when these masses are evolved down to the weak scale .",
    "we therefore assume slepton masses are related to @xmath41 and @xmath42 as given by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) solutions listed in ref .",
    "thus , for @xmath43 , the squarks are basically degenerate with the sleptons ; significant splitting between the masses of the sleptons and squarks is possible only when squarks and gluinos are roughly degenerate , in which case sleptons are considerably lighter than squarks : this latter situation is frequently realized in `` no - scale '' models@xcite , in which neutralino decays to leptons can be enhanced@xcite .",
    "however , the trilepton signal may be considerably reduced when decays @xmath44 or @xmath45 because the daughter lepton tends to be soft , reducing the efficiency for passing cuts .",
    "pair production of charginos and neutralinos at hadron colliders takes place via @xmath46 ( eight reactions ) , @xmath47 ( three reactions ) , and @xmath48 ( ten reactions ) . in fig .  1",
    ", we illustrate total pair production cross sections at @xmath28 tev ( lhc energy ) for @xmath49 , @xmath20 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 production .",
    "we have convoluted with ehlq set 1 parton distributions@xcite .",
    "we show curves versus @xmath6 for ( @xmath52 = ( solid ) , ( 1,20 ) ( dashed ) and ( 2,2 ) ( dotted ) , and have taken @xmath53 throughout . for @xmath6 on the low end of the scale",
    ", cross sections can be very large due to production via _ on - shell _ @xmath19 and @xmath4 decays . for larger values of @xmath6 ,",
    "the chargino and neutralino masses increase , and the cross sections decrease rapidly because production now takes place via _ off - shell _ @xmath19 , @xmath54 and @xmath4 graphs , as well as squark exchange .",
    "even so , we see that the @xmath50 and @xmath20 cross sections remain above the 0.1 @xmath55 level , owing to a large gauge coupling , even for @xmath56 gev .",
    "other chargino - neutralino production processes occur at typically much lower rates , and hence are less likely to give interesting phenomenology .",
    "the most interesting of the chargino - neutralino reactions , as we shall see , is @xmath20 production .",
    "this production rate is actually highest for large values of @xmath57 , due to negative interference between squark exchange and @xmath58 exchange amplitudes .",
    "the branching fractions for two decay modes of the light chargino , @xmath59 , are shown versus @xmath6 in fig .  2 , again for _ a _ )",
    "@xmath60 , _ b _ ) ( 1,20 ) and _ c _ ) ( 2,2 ) , with @xmath53 .",
    "the dashed curves shows the branching fraction for @xmath61 , which typically varies between 10 - 20% , depending on parameter choices , and is @xmath62 for large values of @xmath57 and @xmath63 , for which decay via virtual @xmath19 dominates . for small values of @xmath6 , the decay",
    "@xmath64 is kinematically accessible , and is the dominant decay mode .",
    "for values of @xmath65 gev , two body decays to real @xmath19 bosons become kinematically allowed , and dominate the @xmath59 branching fractions in this region .",
    "several decay modes of the neutralino @xmath9 are shown versus @xmath6 in fig .  3 , for the same cases _ a _ ) ,",
    "_ b _ ) and _ c _ ) as in fig .  2 .",
    "the dashed curves shows the branching fraction for @xmath66 , which is @xmath67 for @xmath68 , but only a few per cent for @xmath69 , where decay via a virtual @xmath4 becomes important .",
    "two body modes such as @xmath70 dominate for small @xmath6 . just as for the light chargino , other two body decay modes of @xmath9 open up around @xmath71 gev . in case _ a _ ) , the decay @xmath72 dominates , and one expects very few leptons from @xmath9 . in case _ b _ ) and _ c _ ) , the mode @xmath2 opens up first , and there is a region in which one expects real @xmath73 in the event sample . as we shall see , the opening of these two body @xmath9 modes can effectively spoil the clean trilepton signal from @xmath20 production , in one case because the leptonic branching fraction for the @xmath4 is rather small , and additional background from @xmath5 appears , and in the other because the higgs boson essentially always decays to @xmath74-quarks .",
    "in order to assess detection prospects for charginos and neutralinos at lhc energy , we use the event simulation program isajet 7.07@xcite . for a given input parameter set",
    ", @xmath75 and @xmath76 , ( recall that @xmath76 are determined by @xmath77 and @xmath42 ) the routine isasusy calculates all sparticle masses and branching fractions to various decay modes .",
    "isajet then produces all combinations of chargino and neutralino production subprocesses , in proportion to their respective cross sections .",
    "the charginos and neutralinos then decay via the various cascades with appropriate branching fractions as given by the mssm .",
    "radiation of initial and final state partons is also included in isajet .",
    "final state quarks and gluons are hadronized , and unstable particles are decayed until stable final states are reached .",
    "underlying event activity is also modeled in isajet .    for event simulation at the lhc",
    ", we use the toy calorimeter simulation package isaplt .",
    "we simulate calorimetry with cell size @xmath78 , which extends between @xmath79 .",
    "we take hadronic energy resolution to be @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and to be a constant @xmath82 for @xmath83 , to model the effective @xmath84 resolution of the forward calorimeter including the effects of shower spreading .",
    "we take electromagnetic resolution to be @xmath85 .",
    "jets are coalesced within cones of @xmath86 using the isajet routine getjet .",
    "for the purpose of jet veto ( essential to eliminate top quark background ) , clusters with @xmath87 gev are labeled as jets .",
    "muons and electrons are classified as isolated if they have @xmath88 gev , @xmath89 , and the visible activity within a cone of @xmath90 about the lepton direction is less than @xmath91 gev .",
    "in our simulation of chargino and neutralino events , we generate all twenty - one of the reactions referred to in sec .",
    "we first classify signals according to the number of isolated leptons present in the signal events .",
    "we found observable signal cross sections in the @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 channels .",
    "however , the @xmath96 sample should be dominated by other sources of susy events , such as gluino and squark production , as well as sm backgrounds .",
    "the @xmath97 channel yielded observable signal rates ; however , these were dominated by large sm backgrounds from @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) , @xmath100 and @xmath34 production , as well as single lepton events from gluino and squark production@xcite .",
    "likewise , the opposite sign ( os ) dilepton ( @xmath101 ) sample , which has a substantial rate due especially to @xmath50 production , suffers large sm backgrounds mainly from @xmath34 production as well as other susy sources@xcite .",
    "same - sign ( ss ) dilepton events can occur from processes such as @xmath20 production , where one of the decay leptons is soft or missed through a crack in the detector , but these rates are small compared to ss dilepton production from squarks and gluinos@xcite . unlike these events , the @xmath20 events would usually be free from jet activity . in this paper , we focus on the zero - jet ( clean ) trilepton signal , which occurs at a substantial rate due to @xmath20 production , and which , with an appropriate set of cuts , is relatively free of sm backgrounds .",
    "there is also a possibility for @xmath102 events from sources such as @xmath51 production followed by subsequent leptonic decays .",
    "these signals have been considered ( as backgrounds to higgs boson decay to neutralino pairs ) in ref .",
    "@xcite ; cross sections range up to a few @xmath103 after cuts , so the signal is not large , although sm physics backgrounds can be eliminated .",
    "in addition , @xmath104 signals have been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ; we did not find significant rates for signal in this channel .    to assess the viability of the trilepton signal at lhc energy , we use isajet 7.07 to generate @xmath105 events for the following four cases , where @xmath106 gev , and @xmath107 :    @xmath108 gev , @xmath109 gev , @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 gev ,    @xmath112 gev , @xmath113 gev , @xmath114 gev , @xmath115 gev ,    @xmath116 gev , @xmath117 gev , @xmath118 gev , @xmath119 gev ,    @xmath120 gev , @xmath121 gev , @xmath122 gev , @xmath123 gev .",
    "the above parameters are motivated by predictions from supergravity gut models with radiative electroweak symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "we also generate sm background event samples from @xmath5 production , as well as from @xmath34 production for @xmath124 gev and @xmath125 gev .",
    "finally , we generate samples with all other possible susy particle production processes , to see if the @xmath20 component can be isolated .",
    "we first select events by requiring    * _ three _ isolated leptons ; the two fastest have @xmath126 gev , while the third has @xmath127 gev .",
    "the signal cross section before and after cuts for the above four cases , sm backgrounds , and trilepton cross sections from other susy sources , are listed in table 1 . at this point , the signal can still be dominated by sm background , but even more so by trilepton events from gluino and squark production .",
    "gluino and squark events should contain substantial jet activity as well as a hard @xmath15 spectrum .",
    "we illustrate the latter for cases 1 - 3 in fig .  4 : the @xmath15 spectrum is clearly harder for @xmath128 and @xmath129 events .",
    "hence , we require in addition    * no central jets , ( @xmath130 gev ; @xmath131 ) , and * @xmath132 gev .",
    "contributions to the trilepton signal from @xmath128 and @xmath129 production are now smaller than the chargino - neutralino signal . at this point ,",
    "the dominant background is from @xmath133 production , so we require    * for os same flavor dileptons , @xmath134 gev .",
    "this reduces the @xmath5 background to below the @xmath103 level , but leaves a significant @xmath34 background , especially for the @xmath124 gev case@xcite .",
    "the latter background can be further reduced by splitting the event sample in two . in the first , we require :    * the two fastest leptons be same sign ( ss ) ; and the flavor of the slow lepton be the same as ( but anti- ) the flavor of either of the two fast leptons .",
    "this diminishes the signal by a factor of about 2 , but almost completely removes top quark background , from which the two hardest leptons , almost always , come from the primary decays of the @xmath135-quarks , and hence have opposite signs .",
    "some of the rejected signal can be recovered by also accepting events with :    * two fastest leptons of opposite sign ( os ) if @xmath136 gev ,    which is more effective in reducing top quark background than signal .",
    "the sum of these two classes of cuts are listed in the last row of table  i , where we find signal in the 1340  @xmath103 range , with sm background at the level of 0.53  @xmath103 , depending on @xmath32 .",
    "in addition , there exists an irremovable contribution , shown in parenthesis , from other susy sources .",
    "we investigated this remaining susy background , and found it to be all either associated production events ( _ e.g. _ @xmath137 , etc . , ) or slepton pair events : the gluino and squark pairs had been completely eliminated . for case  4 ,",
    "the spoiler mode @xmath72 has opened up , thus destroying the trilepton signal .    in table",
    "ii , we list the signal cross sections after all the above cuts as a matrix in @xmath6 vs. @xmath40 for @xmath138",
    ". starred entries are in the lep excluded region .",
    "we see that signal cross sections are usually larger for negative @xmath40 than for positive @xmath40 , due mainly to a larger @xmath139 branching ratio@xcite .",
    "also , for negative @xmath40 , the signal is killed much beyond @xmath140 gev , while for positive @xmath40 one gets a robust signal past @xmath141 gev , especially for the supergravity favored choice , @xmath142 . for @xmath143 gev , a signal of a few @xmath103 persists out to @xmath144 gev .",
    "in fact , for this region of parameter space , most of the trileptons come from subprocesses other than @xmath20 , with _",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath145 , etc .",
    ", also contributing .",
    "how does the signal depend on other choices of @xmath57 and @xmath42 ?",
    "we show in fig .  5 data points for signal rates for @xmath146 , for _ a _ ) the case already considered , ( @xmath147 , and also _ b _ ) ( 2,2 ) , _ c _ ) ( 1,20 ) and finally _ d _ ) ( 2,20 ) .",
    "sm background level is indicated by the dotted line , for the worst case with @xmath124 gev , and the dashed line for @xmath148 gev .",
    "we see that frames _ a _ ) and _ c _ ) , with @xmath68 so that @xmath23 , yield the largest signal cross sections , and these signals remain substantially above background out to @xmath149 gev .",
    "overall behavior is similar for both large and small values of @xmath42 . for frames _ b _ ) and _ d _ ) , with @xmath150 so that sleptons are quite heavy , signal rates drop to the several @xmath103 level , which may be observable above background for the case of a heavier top quark .    as can be seen in fig .  3",
    ", the two body decay @xmath151 opens up and is dominant for frame _ b _ ) and _ c _ ) for @xmath152 gev . in this case",
    ", our cut of @xmath134 gev will also eliminate the signal . to see if this signal can still be gleaned from background , we implement all the above cuts except the offending @xmath4 mass cut .",
    "we set @xmath153 gev , and take @xmath150 , with @xmath107 .",
    "the trilepton cross section is then at the 3.1  @xmath103 level , while @xmath5 background is 59  @xmath103 .",
    "we attempt to remove the @xmath5 background by requiring transverse mass @xmath154 gev , to exclude the real @xmath19 jacobian peak .",
    "this reduces both signal ( which is already small on account of the rather large @xmath59 and @xmath9 masses ) and background to the 1  @xmath103 level , making distinction of this tiny signal very difficult .",
    "hence , the @xmath2 two body decay also acts as a spoiler mode for trilepton events , in part because the signal becomes rate - limited due to the small leptonic branching ratio of the @xmath4 boson together with the fact that the the real @xmath4 mode is open only when the @xmath9 ( and @xmath59 ) is rather heavy , but also due to irremovable @xmath5 background .",
    "in addition , we have investigated whether the @xmath20 signal with @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath157 ) is observable . here",
    ", we looked for a single lepton plus two central jet signal .",
    "in addition , we required one @xmath74-jet to have its decay vertex tagged with an efficiency as given in ref .",
    "we then looked for a mass bump at @xmath158 .",
    "the mass bump was unfortunately obscured by a @xmath34 background @xmath21 times greater than signal .",
    "hence , we affirm that the @xmath72 decay mode is indeed a spoiler .",
    "for the values of parameters examined in this paper , there will be a plethora of various signals from susy at the lhc just from gluino and squark production@xcite .",
    "the unique feature of the trilepton signal for lhc is that it offers the possibility of reasonably clean information on sparticle masses from which to start to unravel the whole susy particle spectrum . with a relatively pure sample of signal events , and an event structure consisting of only three isolated leptons plus no jets ,",
    "it is especially easy to reconstruct where each lepton came from : in @xmath159 events , the @xmath160 come from the neutralino , whereas in @xmath161 events , the os dilepton with smallest transverse opening angle usually comes from the neutralino .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the invariant mass @xmath10 in trilepton events after all cuts , for cases 1 , 2 and 3 above .",
    "we show the sm background ( dots ) and the susy signal plus sm and susy background ( solid ) , where we have taken the mass of the same flavor os dilepton pair in @xmath159 events , and the mass of the os pair with the smaller transverse opening angle in @xmath161 events .",
    "kinematically , the mass spectrum is constrained to lie between @xmath162 .",
    "the sharp cutoff at the upper end - point is evident from these plots , offering a clean measure of @xmath11 .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath11 in these figures is 51 , 64 and 78 gev , for cases 1 , 2 and 3 , respectively . in models with @xmath163 much larger than the electroweak gaugino masses ( as is the case in sugra models ) , one frequently expects @xmath164 @xcite , so that the cutoff in @xmath10 occurs at approximately @xmath165 : this is true in our simulations .    are there other distributions which can yield significant information constraining sparticle masses ?",
    "explicit mass reconstruction is , of course , not possible since in each event one is missing a neutrino and the two massive @xmath166 particles .",
    "however , we examined a variety of distributions , including trilepton invariant mass , @xmath167 , the summed scalar transverse energy , @xmath168 , and the three lepton plus missing energy cluster transverse mass , @xmath169 .",
    "all these distributions suffered substantial smearing due mainly to the continuum nature of the underlying @xmath170 subprocess ; additional smearing is expected for distributions involving @xmath15 if lhc is run at high luminosity , where event pile - up becomes a problem .",
    "the distributions do scale with overall sparticle mass values .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "7 for the cluster transverse mass .",
    "the solid histograms show the @xmath171 distribution for cases 1 , 2 and 3 , after all cuts .",
    "the distribution maxima increases with increasing sparticle mass , as does the distribution mean , which is 154 , 175 and 195 gev for the respective cases .",
    "the distributions are also sensitive to the @xmath166 mass , in that if @xmath172 , there is more energy available to make visible decay products . to illustrate this , we show via dashed histograms the distribution shapes where we have by hand set the @xmath166 mass to zero without changing other masses and branching fractions . in this case , the distribution maxima move substantially to higher energy , and the means move to 195 , 225 and 271 gev , respectively .",
    "if a trilepton signal is found above expected background levels , then the shapes of distributions such as cluster transverse mass or summed scalar @xmath173 will also serve to constrain the sparticle masses .",
    "for example , for the plots in fig .",
    "7 , the distribution means can be parameterized as @xmath174 for the various cases in fig . 7",
    ", this reproduces the distribution means to within 3 - 6 gev .",
    "we have also checked that this is an adequate fit for cases where just the chargino mass is reduced by 20 gev .",
    "it should , however , be remembered that the fit in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is sensitive to the details of the cuts and detector simulation .",
    "our purpose in showing this is to illustrate that it should be possible to obtain further information on the sparticle masses from the transverse mass , summed scalar @xmath173 , and trilepton invariant mass distributions .",
    "in addition , we have investigated a variety of other distributions which show sensitivity to sparticle masses . in @xmath175 events ,",
    "the transverse opening angle @xmath176 decreases with increasing @xmath177 , for fixed @xmath11 : _ i.e. _ the dilepton pair becomes more tightly collimated .",
    "also , the opening angle @xmath178 ( between @xmath179 and the vector sum of @xmath180 and @xmath181 ) increases with increasing @xmath182 ( again , for fixed @xmath11 ) , so that events are more nearly back - to - back .",
    "moreover , the @xmath183 distribution is sensitive to @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , if a signal is observed , a variety of distributions will have to be tested against various sparticle mass hypotheses .",
    "likelihood functions can then be constructed to ascertain the most probable sparticle mass combination .",
    "we have reexamined the signal from the production of charginos and neutralinos at the lhc using isajet 7.07 , incorporating experimental conditions corresponding to a generic lhc detector . as in ref.@xcite , we find that the reaction @xmath184 provides the best prospects for the identification of the signal .",
    "the signal thus consists of events with three hard , isolated leptons and essentially no jet activity .",
    "we have devised a set of cuts to reduce backgrounds from top quarks and @xmath5 production to negligible levels _ provided _ that two body decays of charginos and neutralinos are kinematically inaccessible .",
    "the observation of this signal would be direct evidence for neutralino production ; this is especially important since the production of ( gaugino - like ) neutralinos by @xmath12 collisions is strongly suppressed unless the selectron is also rather light .",
    "the effect of the various cuts as well as the signal level for representative choices of parameters is shown in table i. we also mention that with these cuts , other susy sources of trileptons such as squark or gluino pair production , or the production of gluinos and squarks in association with a chargino contribute between just 315% to the signal .",
    "the relatively clean sample of chargino and neutralino events , as we will see , enables us to obtain experimental constraints on their masses .",
    "we see from table i that the signal cross section exceeds 10 @xmath103 ( corresponding to more than 100 events per year even assuming the lower value for the lhc design luminosity ) for chargino and neutralino masses up to about 150 gev , corresponding to @xmath185 gev . for yet heavier sparticles ( case 4 in table i ) , the decays @xmath186 , @xmath39 become kinematically accessible . these then dominate the decays of @xmath9 . in the first case ,",
    "the trilepton cross section is reduced to an unobservable level since the higgs boson decays to heavy fermions . in the other case where two leptons come from the decay of a real z ,",
    "there remains a background from @xmath5 production ; although a signal to background ratio of 1:1 is possible after a transverse mass cut , the signal appears to be too small for this strategy to be viable .",
    "the dependence of the signal on the superpotential parameter @xmath40 is shown in table ii , while the variation with @xmath42 and @xmath57 is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 .    motivated by the fact that after our cuts we are left with a relatively uncontaminated sample of @xmath20 events , we have examined the prospects for measuring chargino and neutralino masses from these events .",
    "since the invariant mass of dileptons from @xmath9 decays is kinematically constrained to be smaller than @xmath11 , this mass difference can be inferred from the upper edge of the distribution shown in fig .",
    "since at least several hundred trilepton events are expected at the lhc with an integrated luminosity of 10 - 20 @xmath187 , it should be possible to construct this distribution rather well .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to directly reconstruct the masses of the @xmath59 or @xmath9 because two neutralinos and the neutrino are undetected in every event .",
    "we have shown , however , that by studying the shapes of other distributions such as the @xmath188-distribution ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , or the @xmath189-distribution , whose means may be expected to scale with parent masses as discussed in sec .",
    "iv , it should be possible to obtain one further constraint between @xmath165 , @xmath190 and @xmath26 . ultimately , matching a variety of observed distributions against different sparticle mass hypotheses",
    "should allow the most probable combination of sparticle masses consistent with data to be selected .",
    "these experimental constraints may serve as a relatively clean starting point for the procedure of unraveling the whole spectrum of susy particle masses .",
    "such information ought to help test the ideas behind supergravity grand unification ( for instance , the unification of gaugino masses ) , and further , to aid in sorting out more complex events from the cascade decays of gluinos and squarks .",
