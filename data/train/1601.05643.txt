    "the statistical physics of equilibrium is based on boltzmann s ergodic principle , that states the equivalence between the time average of any observable @xmath10 over a sufficiently long time @xmath11 and an ensemble average over microscopic configurations @xmath12 of energies @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 represents the boltzmann distribution at inverse temperature @xmath16 with the corresponding partition function @xmath17 even if historically and physically , this dynamical interpretation of the equilibrium is essential , it is sometimes somewhat forgotten. in particular to discuss the appearance of low temperature symmetry broken phases in pure systems like ferromagnets , it has become usual to reason only _ statically _ in terms of the properties of the boltzmann measure in the thermodynamic limit , because the possible pure states are completely obvious . for disordered systems ,",
    "many discussions of the equilibrium are also based on the same purely static point of view , but they face the huge problem that whenever disorder induces some frustration as in spin - glasses , the possible pure states are not at all obvious ( see for instance the book @xcite and references therein ) . for such systems ,",
    "a much clearer physical description can be thus achieved by returning to the historical point of view of statistical mechanics where the equilibrium is considered as the stationary measure of some _ dynamics _ , so that the question on the number of phases for the equilibrium becomes a question of ergodicity - breaking for the dynamics @xcite .",
    "this broken - ergodicity point of view is actually also the historical point of view for the spin - glass problem : in their original paper @xcite , edwards and anderson have defined their order parameter by the following sentence : `` if on one observation a particular spin is @xmath18 , then if it is studied again a long time later , there is a non - vanishing probability that @xmath19 will point in the same direction '' .",
    "the importance of this definition has been further emphasized by anderson in @xcite : `` if the spins are going to polarize in a particular random function [ ... ] , we had better not try to characterize the order by some kind of long - ranged order in space , or by some kind of order parameter defined in space , but _",
    "we must approach it from a pure non - ergodic point of view , as a long - range order in the time alone _ : if the system has a certain order at @xmath20 , then as @xmath21 there remain a finite memory of that order '' .    in the present paper ,",
    "we thus wish to detect the presence of the low - temperature ordered phase via the renormalization of the stochastic dynamics at finite temperature .",
    "the relevant valleys in configuration space are thus obtained as the longest - lived valleys of the dynamics .",
    "this idea has been used previously to define a renormalization procedure of the master equation _ in configuration space _ @xcite . here",
    "we focus on the dyson hierarchical spin models in order to derive explicit renormalization rules _ in real space_.    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_dynquant ] ,",
    "we recall how the large - time properties of the finite - temperature stochastic dynamics of classical ising models are related to the low - energy states of related quantum spin hamiltonians . in section [ sec_rg ]",
    ", we introduce a real - space renormalization procedure for the case of dyson hierarchical ising models . in section [ sec_ferro ] ,",
