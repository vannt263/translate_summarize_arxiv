    "the 2011 tohoku earthquake with magnitude of 9.0 or 9.1 struck the northeastern part of japan .",
    "the earthquake was ranked as the fourth largest in the world .",
    "the overall cost of the damage has been estimated to be the tens of billions of us dollars , and 19,295 were killed and 359,073 houses were destroyed by the earthquake and resulting tsumani  @xcite .",
    "this demonstrated that extreme events actually occur , implying that the probability of extreme events is small yet nonnegligible .",
    "this behavior can be characterized by large variances and fat tails in probability distributions both of damage and of natural disaster .",
    "statistical properties of damage are also influenced by those of population / property exposed to disasters that have been described by large variances and fat tails . despite its importance",
    ", the fat tail property and its implications in risk analysis have been far from being fully understood , although fat - tailed distributions of natural disaster and population / property have been intensively studied in statistical physics , geography , and other disciplines .    in order to better understand the effect of natural disaster and population / property on damage",
    ", we devise a simple model by combining the occurrence distribution of natural disaster with population / property distributions .",
    "these distributions are assumed to have fat tails as various types of natural disasters , like earthquake and forest fire , and population / property are known to be described by fat - tailed or power - law distributions  @xcite .",
    "we also take into account the tendency that population / property are spatially correlated partly due to the urbanization as there exist empirical and theoretical studies supporting such a tendency  @xcite .",
    "we make additional assumptions .",
    "firstly , the disasters are moving along a straight line .",
    "secondly , the vulnerability is constant independent of the intensity of natural disaster and of exposed population / property .",
    "these assumptions can be easily relaxed to incorporate more generalized features , such as nonlinear dependence of vulnerability .",
    "our model suggests large variances and fat tails of casualty and property damage by natural disaster .",
    "we analytically solve the model for the limiting cases such that population / property are either fully uncorrelated or fully correlated in space .",
    "the more realistic , partially correlated cases are studied by numerical simulations because they are not analytically solvable . in general , the fat tail property of damage is expected to be affected by fat tail properties and spatial correlations of natural disaster and population / property . however , this is not always the case .",
    "we find that the fat tail of damage can be determined by either that of natural disaster or those of population / property , depending on which has a fatter tail than the other .",
    "the spatial correlations of population / property can enhance or reduce the fat tail property of damage , depending on how fat the tails of population / property distributions are . in order to empirically support our model",
    ", we analyze the dataset of casualties and property damages by tornadoes in the united states over 19702011 .",
    "it is confirmed that the distributions of damage show fat tails .",
    "our research has implications in the effect of large variance and fat tail of damage on risk - related decision making .",
    "if we treat the variance of damage with the assumption of normal or thin - tailed distributions as in the typical risk analysis , it may lead to inefficient social investment to reduce vulnerability and consequently the damage . as weitzman demonstrated with his dismal theorem , the fat tail property of uncertainty results in arbitrarily large or divergent expected loss , threatening the standard cost - benefit analysis  @xcite .",
    "our results emphasize the need to focus more on decision under uncertainty with fat - tailed distributions .",
    "the paper is organized as following .",
    "our model is introduced in section model and its analytic and numerical results are presented in section result , with empirical analysis of damages by tornadoes . in section conclusion , we conclude our paper with some remarks .",
    "empirical findings about damages by natural disasters indicate that such damages can have large variances and be often characterized by fat - tailed or power - law distributions  @xcite .",
    "the power - law distribution , e.g. , for a damage @xmath0 , is formally presented as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a power - law exponent characterizing the degree of fat tail property . in such distributions ,",
    "the statistics can not be properly represented only by means due to very large or even diverging variances .",
    "the probability of extreme events is small yet nonnegligible , while the probability rapidly approaches zero for the thin - tailed cases such as exponential distributions .",
    "in general , the risk or damage by natural disaster has been analyzed as a function of three components : natural disaster , population / property exposed to the disaster , and vulnerability of those population / property  @xcite . in order to account for large variance of damage",
    ", we devise a simple model by combining the occurrence distribution of natural disaster with population / property distributions , while the vulnerability is assumed to be constant .",
    "we will discuss each of three components in more detail .",
    "firstly , for population / property distributions , we consider two characteristics : probability density function ( pdf ) and spatial correlation . some pdfs of population / property , denoted by @xmath3 ,",
    "are known to show power - laws as @xmath4 with exponent @xmath5 .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath5 for the wealth of the world s richest people over 19962012 ranges from @xmath6 to @xmath7  @xcite , which can be related to pareto principle  @xcite .",
    "the population distribution of cities in the united states follows a power - law with exponent @xmath8  @xcite , consistent with zipf s law .",
    "in addition , we consider spatial correlations of population / property because the spatial correlation can increase the variance of damage as exposed population / property are spatially concentrated due to the urbanization , such as manhattan in new york city and gangnam in seoul .",
    "areas with better accessibility may create more value , and the rents and infrastructural value of the areas could be higher .",
    "company headquarters are likely to be located in such areas .",
    "it is also likely that the neighborhood of the rich ( the poor ) is rich ( poor ) .",
    "based on these observations we assume that the pdfs of population / property are characterized by power - law distributions as @xmath4 , and that those population / property are spatially correlated .    secondly , the nature of natural disaster is considered .",
    "it is known that the intensity of natural disaster like earthquake , storm , and forest fire follows a power - law distribution  @xcite . in our work , we focus on disasters like tornadoes that move along a trajectory .",
    "since the intensity of disaster can be incorporated in modeling the vulnerability , we instead assume the length of a trajectory , denoted by @xmath9 , to be distributed as power - law , @xmath10 with exponent @xmath11 .",
    "for simplicity , we assume that each disaster is initiated at a random position , and moves in a random direction along a straight line of length @xmath9 . the assumption of straight line can be easily relaxed to consider curved trajectories or even more complicated geometry .",
    "the assumption that the initiation position is not correlated with spatial configurations of population / property seems to be strong . in reality , people can choose to live in a location with less disasters to avoid damage .",
    "in contrast , people can prefer a location with more disasters if natural phenomena related to a certain disaster can benefit people despite possible damage by such disaster .",
    "for example , coastal area is more likely to be affected by tsunamis , while it provides ports for trade and fishing .",
    "thirdly , we consider the vulnerability as a fraction of the realized damage out of each unit of population / property .",
    "it differs by variables such as wealth , building code , and network structure of infrastructure .",
    "since there are more hospitals and more labor who are devoted to control disasters in cities , cities could have less vulnerability . on the other hand",
    ", cities could be more vulnerable due to a cascading effect of damage . in our model , since the property of vulnerability is hard to measure , we assume that the vulnerability is constant through the trajectory of disaster . our model with the assumption of constant vulnerability can provide benchmark results for further realistic refinements .",
    "finally , the total damage by a natural disaster is modeled to be as the sum of population / property exposed to that disaster , multiplied by the vulnerability of those population / property .    , where the probability density function of value @xmath3 follows a power - law as @xmath4 with @xmath12 .",
    "the height at each site represents a logarithm of the value . ]",
    "we first generate landscapes or configurations of population / property on a two - dimensional square lattice of size @xmath13 with a periodic boundary condition , see fig .",
    "[ fig : landscape ] .",
    "the population / property , or a value for convenience , at site @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath15 for @xmath16 .",
    "the pdf of value is assumed to follow a power law , @xmath4 with exponent @xmath17 . to parameterize the degree of spatial correlation of value",
    ", we define a normalized centrality @xmath18 as a function of value configuration @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 measures the total difference between values of neighboring sites . @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote the values of @xmath21 for random and concentrated configurations , respectively .",
    "the zero centrality , @xmath24 , corresponds to the random configuration , while the maximum centrality , @xmath25 , implies that the values are concentrated in the central area , i.e. , around the origin @xmath26 .",
    "the configuration with intermediate @xmath18 is formulated using a simulated annealing algorithm .",
    "starting from a random configuration , two randomly selected sites swap their values only if the swapping increases the correlation .",
    "the swapping is repeated until the correlation reaches the desired value of @xmath18 .",
    "figure  [ fig : landscape ] shows exemplary configurations of value for random ( @xmath24 ) , correlated ( @xmath27 ) , and concentrated ( @xmath25 ) cases .    for natural disasters ,",
    "we focus on moving disasters like tornadoes that move along a trajectory .",
    "we assume that a disaster initiated at a random site moves in a random direction , i.e. , one of @xmath28 and @xmath29 directions , over the trajectory with length @xmath9 .",
    "the length @xmath9 is randomly drawn from a distribution @xmath10 with exponent @xmath30 .",
    "the vulnerability @xmath31 at site @xmath14 is assumed to be constant for all sites in the system such that @xmath32 for all @xmath14 for convenience .",
    "then , the damage @xmath0 by the disaster initiated at @xmath33 and moving @xmath9 sites , say in the direction of @xmath34-axis , is given as the sum of values over the trajectory : @xmath35",
    "it is expected that the damage @xmath0 has a large variance by showing a fat - tailed distribution , @xmath36 with exponent @xmath37 . in general , the value of @xmath37 depends on exponents @xmath5 , @xmath11 , and the centrality @xmath18 .",
    "the case of random configurations with zero centrality can be analytically solved due to its uncorrelated nature  @xcite .",
    "the damage @xmath0 is independent of the initiation position and moving direction of the disaster , hence it can be written as a sum of @xmath9 independent and identical random variables , @xmath3s : @xmath38 for small @xmath9 , as @xmath9 is mostly @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 , we obtain @xmath41 for @xmath42 . for sufficiently large @xmath9 , if the variance of @xmath43 is small , one can approximate as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 denotes an average , leading to @xmath46 for @xmath42 . finally , for sufficiently large @xmath9 , if the variance of @xmath43 is large , @xmath0 is dominated by @xmath47 that is proportional to @xmath48 . by means of the identity @xmath49",

    "we obtain apart from the coefficients @xmath51 thus for large @xmath0 , @xmath52 which is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediagram](a ) .",
    "this solution has been also obtained by rigorous calculations  @xcite . in case with @xmath53 and @xmath54 , i.e. , when the tail of value distribution is sufficiently thin , one obtains @xmath55 , implying that statistical properties of damage are determined only by those of disaster . in case with @xmath56 and @xmath57 , one gets @xmath58 , implying the dominance of statistical properties of value in deciding damage .",
    "only when both value and disaster distributions have sufficiently fat tails , i.e. , when @xmath59 , the fat tail of damage can be explained in terms of the interplay of both value and disaster .",
    "we perform numerical simulations on the square lattice of linear size @xmath60 to confirm our analysis as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric ] .",
    "since a concentrated configuration with @xmath25 has a rotational symmetry around the origin @xmath26 , it can be described simply by a function of the distance @xmath61 from the origin , i.e. , @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "the relation @xmath63 has been obtained by the identity @xmath64 . for convenience ,",
    "we calculate @xmath0 in a continuum limit of lattice as @xmath65 where the polar coordinate @xmath66 and the angle @xmath67 are the initiation position and moving direction of the disaster , and @xmath68 denotes the transverse dimension or width of the disaster . since @xmath69 can be written in terms of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , we get @xmath72^{-\\mu/2}dt.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for small @xmath9 , the integration is approximated up to the first order of @xmath9 , leading to @xmath73 .",

    "one gets @xmath76 note that @xmath77 .",
    "the following formula can be used : @xmath78 where @xmath79 gives the sign of @xmath80 and @xmath81 is the hypergeometric function .",
    "we consider two cases according to the moving direction of the disaster . in case with @xmath82 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath83 , the disaster moves away from the central area .",
    "we get the result up to the leading terms as @xmath84 with a constant @xmath85 . if @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) , from @xmath88 , we have the term @xmath89 for @xmath42 .",
    "this is dominated by @xmath41 because @xmath90 for @xmath87 . if @xmath91 ( @xmath92 ) , @xmath93 leads to the term @xmath94 for @xmath42 , which is dominated by @xmath46 for @xmath30 . on the other hand , for @xmath95",
    ", i.e. , @xmath96 , the disaster approaches the central area to some extent and eventually moves away .",
    "the domain of integration in eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_c1 ] ) can be divided into two at the closest position of the disaster to the origin given by @xmath97 : @xmath98 here the second inequality holds for sufficiently large @xmath9 .",
    "similarly to the case with @xmath82 , we get the same result up to the leading terms as eq .",
    "( [ eq : d_c1_case1 ] ) but with @xmath99 replaced by @xmath100 . finally ,",
    "since @xmath101 , we obtain the result for @xmath37 as @xmath102 this solution is depicted in fig .",

    "if @xmath53 or @xmath56 , we get @xmath104 from @xmath101 for both cases of @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the first term @xmath41 is mainly due to @xmath105 when @xmath106 , hence it is independent of the spatial correlation or centrality @xmath18 .",
    "the second term @xmath46 is due to @xmath107 .",
    "that is , most disasters move along trajectories consisting of small @xmath108s when the tail of @xmath109 is sufficiently thin , i.e. , when @xmath53 .",
    "this leads to the irrelevance of the spatial correlation .",
    "thus , one can expect that @xmath104 holds for the entire range of @xmath18 .",
    "this is confirmed by numerical simulations for the case of @xmath12 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](f ) , with some deviations mainly due to logarithmic corrections to scaling , like @xmath110 , and finite size effects .",
    "it is observed that the estimated values of @xmath37 are systematically smaller for larger centrality , implying fatter tails of damage distributions .    for @xmath111 and @xmath112 ,",
    "the difference in values of @xmath37 for @xmath24 and for @xmath25 is summarized as follows :",
    "@xmath113 this implies that the tail of damage distribution for the concentrated case is always thinner than that for the random case .",

    "the numerical simulations for the case of @xmath117 in fig .",
    "[ fig : numeric](c ) confirm the analytic solution , with deviations due to corrections to scaling and finite size effects .",
    "while such deviations seem to be large , we systematically observe that in the region of @xmath112 , the values of @xmath37 for @xmath25 are slightly larger than those for @xmath24 , comparable to the analytic results .",
    "it turns out that whether the spatial correlation of value enhances or reduces the fat tail property of damage is not a simple issue as expected .",
    "the randomness in value configurations may enhance the variance of damage by introducing more fluctuations in exposed values when the tail of value distribution is sufficiently fat ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the randomness may reduce the variance of damage by mixing the values when the tail of value distribution is sufficiently thin ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the former explains the analytic expectation that the damage will have fatter tails for more correlated configurations , while the latter does the numerical observations of the opposite tendency .      in order to support our results , we empirically study casualty and property damage distributions by tornadoes in the united states from 1970 to 2011 , for which the data were retrieved on 24 june 2011 from the website of national climatic data center . by assuming a power - law form for those distributions , the power - law exponents are estimated as @xmath118 for the numbers of death and the injured , and @xmath119 for property and crop damages , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tornado ] .",
    "the significantly different values of power - law exponent , i.e. , @xmath120 and @xmath6 , could imply that they represent qualitatively different underlying mechanisms or origins .    in order to account for these observations for tornadoes ,",
    "our simple model can be extended to take into account various factors like position - dependent vulnerability .",
    "for example , let us consider that the vulnerability at a site scales with the value at that site as @xmath121 , where the scaling exponent @xmath122 can be positive or negative depending on the situation . since the effective value , denoted by @xmath123 , is proportional to @xmath124 , the fat tail of the pdf of effective value is characterized by the power - law exponent @xmath125 .",
    "note that @xmath126 reduces to @xmath5 for @xmath127 as in our simplest setup .",
    "more detailed analysis for the effect of position - dependent vulnerability is left for future works .",
    "we have developed a simple model to show that damages by natural disasters could have large variances in terms of fat - tailed distributions of natural disaster and population / property , as well as in terms of their spatial correlations .",
    "the damage has been modeled as the sum of population / property exposed to the moving disaster , while the vulnerability was assumed to be constant through the trajectory of disaster .",
    "our simple model draws limits to the implication of the results . in reality",
    ", vulnerability differs by variables such as wealth , building code , and network structure of infrastructure .",
    "the trajectory of disaster may be not straight .",
    "however , our model can still provide the benchmark results for more realistic refinements , for which these assumptions can be easily relaxed .",
    "our research enables to quantitatively study the effect of fat tail property , in terms of the exact analytic results for the power - law exponent of damage distributions .",
    "thus , our model can serve as more concrete framework for future studies on damage by natural disaster as well as risk analysis under uncertainty with fat - tailed distributions .",
    "we also note that since a portion of damages due to climate change is associated with natural disaster , our research can provide grounds to the discussion on the fat tail property of damage due to climate change  @xcite ."
