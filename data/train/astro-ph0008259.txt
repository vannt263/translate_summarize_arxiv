    "the radio source nvss j235953 - 124148 ( z=0.868 ) , hereafter qso  23591241 , is unique among quasars .",
    "it shows intrinsic absorption from :  and , which appear in less than 1% of optically selected quasars ; , which is even less frequent ; and from a meta - stable  level , which is only seen in two or three other agns .",
    "we use the term `` intrinsic absorption '' following the definition given by hamann et al ( 1997 ) and barlow ( 1997 ) . whenever this absorption is significantly blue - shifted with respect to the systemic redshift of the quasar ,",
    "we interpret it as rising from an outflow connected with the agn . in   2 we establish the intrinsic nature of the absorption seen in qso  23591241 .",
    "besides its rare absorption features , qso  23591241 has very high intrinsic polarization ( @xmath95% ) and is moderately reddened ( brotherton et al .",

    "1995 ; arp 102b , halpern et al 1996 ; first  0840 + 3633 and 1556 + 3517 , becker et al .",

    "an even smaller subset shows  in absorption ( arp 102b , qso  1044 + 3656 ) .",
    "for example , from the six objects studied by voit , weymann and korista ( 1993 ) only one ( qso  00592735 ) shows absorption and none show  absorption .",
    "qso  23591241 shows absorption features from all these ions as well as from . in the discussion we elaborate on the conditions needed for detecting these lines ( both physical and observational ) and argue that even though the low - ionization features in qso  23591241 are too narrow to be classified as classical bals , they are definitely part of a bal outflow because of their association with the much wider high - ionization absorption troughs (  @xmath11549 and  @xmath11397 ) seen in the ultraviolet spectrum .",
    "the ions detected in absorption and their unique characteristics make qso  23591241 a promising probe for the study of quasar outflows .",
    "features that can be used as diagnostics include :    \\1 ) appearance of relatively unblended absorption features from both components of the  doublet allows us to determine whether the flow completely covers the emission region .",
    "a partial covering of the source is taken as a direct evidence for the intrinsic nature of the absorber ( barlow 1997 ; hamann et al .",
    "1997 ; arav et al .",
    "1999b ) , that is , an outflow associated with the agn .",
    "it also shows that the apparent column densities extracted from the absorption trough are only lower limits ( arav 1997 ; arav et al .",

    "\\2 ) neutral helium absorption lines from the highly meta - stable level 2@xmath10s .",
    "very few agns show these lines , where known examples are mrk 231 ( boksenberg et al 1977 ; rudy , stocke & foltz 1985 ) , ngc 4151 ( anderson 1974 ) and perhaps 3cr 68.1 ( brotherton et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the  lines are important diagnostics for the ionization state of the gas . from the ionization equilibrium of this level",
    "we can infer lower limits on the he@xmath11 column density and therefore lower limits on the  column density .",
    "the different oscillator strengths of the detected lines allow us to determine the real optical depth and covering factor of the  absorbers .",
    "\\3 ) detection of absorption from excited states of allows for lower limits and sometimes even determination of the number density of electrons ( @xmath12 ) in the gas . in a study of qso  1044 + 3656 ( de kool et al .",
    "2000 ) we were able to determine @xmath12 in the outflow and combined with photo - ionization constraints showed that the outflow is situated about 1000 pc . from the central source .",
    "\\4 ) appearance of  absorption necessitates a low ionization parameter , since it is difficult to shield  from ionizing photons .",
    "( the ionization parameter @xmath13 is defined as the ratio of number densities between hydrogen ionizing photons and hydrogen nuclei in all forms . )    to realize this diagnostic potential we observed the optical spectrum of qso  23591241 using the hires spectrograph on the keck telescope . in this paper",
    "we concentrate on a detailed analysis of the numerous absorption features seen in our high - resolution ground - based spectroscopic data (   2 ) , and in low - resolution hst uv prism data (   3 ) . in ",
    "4 we analyze the ionization equilibrium and abundances of the outflow .",
    "the discovery of the object , its radio , polarization , and overall optical characteristics are described in a companion paper ( brotherton et al .",
    "on december 26 , 1998 we used the high resolution echelle spectrometer ( hires , vogt et al .",
    "1994 ) on the keck  i 10-m telescope to obtain @xmath14 second exposures of qso 2359@xmath01241 covering 4330 - 7450  using a 11 wide slit .",
    "the orders overlap up to 6410 , beyond which small gaps occur between orders .",
    "the slit was rotated to the parallactic angle to minimize losses due to differential atmospheric refraction .",
    "the observing conditions were excellent with sub - arcsecond seeing and near - photometric skies .",
    "the spectra were extracted using routines tailored for hires ( barlow 2000 ) .",
    "the resolution of the final spectrum is @xmath15 .",
    "a smooth continuum was fit to the spectrum in regions free of absorption or emission features .",
    "this procedure is somewhat subjective , particularly in the case of blended emission lines ( such as ) . while unlikely to create any false absorption features , this normalization introduces some uncertainty in the true continuum level ; consequently , equivalent widths of absorption features are somewhat uncertain .",
    "many of the absorption features in the hires data arise from a complex intrinsic absorber .",
    "the evidence for the absorber being intrinsic is based on : 1 ) comparing the absorption features seen in the doublet ( the apparent optical depth ratio differs from the nominal value of 1:2 ) .",
    "2 ) existence of  absorption from a meta - stable state , which requires the density of the absorber to be several orders of magnitude larger than is seen in the ism and igm .",
    "3 ) existence of  absorption from excited levels , which also necessitates high density .",
    "4 ) appearance of full fledge bals (  @xmath11549 ,  @xmath11397 ) in the hst foc spectrum which coincide in velocity with the absorption seen in the hires data .",
    "each of these separate pieces of evidence is enough by itself to identify the absorption system as intrinsic . in the rest of this section",
    "we analyze the features in the hires data that are associated with this intrinsic absorber .",
    "[ [ section ] ]    a high resolution spectrum of the  absorption feature reveals a rich and complex structure . in figure 2",
    "we show hires data for a part of the  absorption , the spectral region shown in figure 2 is marked on the insert to figure 1 .",
    "we have labeled five distinct absorption features ( @xmath16 ) associated with the red doublet component , which are also seen in the blue doublet component .",
    "absorption features @xmath17 and @xmath18 are seen in the blue doublet component , but their red counterparts are blended with the ( @xmath16 ) blue complex .",
    "the appearance of the same features in both doublet components allow us to study the covering factor and real optical depth of the outflow .",
    "however , the situation in qso  23591241 is not ideal since the red component of feature @xmath18 falls in the middle of blue component of feature @xmath19 ; the red component of feature @xmath17 contaminates the blue component of feature @xmath20 ; and there is a shallower red absorption contribution across the entire blue absorption structure @xmath16 .",
    "these contaminations do not allow for a clean simultaneous solution for the covering factor and the optical depth ( as was done for the  bal in qso 1603 + 3002 ; arav et al 1999b ) .",
    "however , most of the contaminating absorption is rather shallow and we can still get semi - quantitative results from analyzing the relationship between the same absorption features seen in both doublet components .    to analyze the residual intensities we first need to normalize the data .",
    "since the absorption occur on the blue wing of the  broad emission line ( bel ) , there are two physical choices here .",
    "first , the outflow may cover both the continuum source and the bel region .",
    "in this case we model the emission line with two gaussians and divide the data by the assumed unabsorbed emission , which consists of the bel plus continuum .",
    "second , the outflow may only cover the continuum source and not the bel region . in balqso  1603 + 3002",
    "there is strong evidence that the flow does not cover the bels ( arav et al 1999b ) . for this case",
    "we need to subtract the modeled bel from the data in order to determine the flux seen by the absorber .",
    "we then divide this flux by the continuum to obtain the normalized flux seen by the absorber .",
    "we will argue below that the second scenario is more probable and use this normalization in figure [ hires_mg2 ] .",
    "figure [ mg2_abs_fits_combined ] shows a comparison of the absorption features in each doublet component . for direct comparison we use velocity presentation and the two panels show the two normalizations discussed above .",
    "we use a thick solid line for the blue component data and a thin line for the red one .",
    "if the flow fully covers the qso s emission ( both continuum source and bel regions ) , the expected residual intensity of the absorption features seen in the blue doublet component is : @xmath21[expected]@xmath22[observed ] ; where @xmath23 is the residual intensity of the absorption features seen in the red doublet component .",
    "we plot this expected blue residual intensity in figure [ mg2_abs_fits_combined ] as a dotted line . in both normalizations it is evident that the depth of features @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the blue doublet component is smaller than expected by assuming complete coverage .",
    "this is a clear indication for partial covering and hence for the intrinsic nature of the absorption ( barlow 1997 ) .",
    "we note that partial covering is not restricted only to geometrical coverage .",
    "the photons at the bottom of the troughs may also arise from scattering contribution .",
    "if we assume that the flow does not cover the bel region , the top panel in figure [ mg2_abs_fits_combined ] show that the residual intensities for features @xmath20 and @xmath25 are identical within the errors in both doublet components . in this case",
    "both features are saturated ( @xmath26 ) and the shape of the absorption profile is completely dependent on the covering factor . if the flow covers the continuum and the bel equally , then from the bottom panel of figure [ mg2_abs_fits_combined ] we also infer that the blue doublet absorption of features @xmath24 and @xmath25 is not deep enough if we assume complete coverage .",
    "therefore , we conclude that no matter which normalization we use the flow in features @xmath24 and @xmath25 show partial coverage and hence demonstrate the intrinsic nature of the absorber .    which of the two covering scenarios is more probable ?",
    "in the case of balqso  1603 + 3002 we argued that `` in the absence of a physical preference for @xmath27 values of order unity , values between 25 necessitate some fine tuning whereas the range @xmath28 is simply much more probable numerically . ''",
    "this argument suggests that it is more probable that features @xmath20 and @xmath25 do not cover the bel region .",
    "however , we notice that the equal covering normalization ( bottom panel in fig .",
    "[ mg2_abs_fits_combined ] ) shows that feature @xmath29 might completely cover both the continuum source and the bel region ( expected and observed blue component are equal ) .",
    "this scenario is simpler , since it does not necessitate a partial covering factor , and thus is more appealing .",
    "we suggest that the first argument is somewhat stronger and therefore it is more probable that features @xmath20 and @xmath25 do not cover the bel region . however , the evidence is weaker than is seen in balqso  1603 + 3002 .",
    "in addition to components @xmath30 there is a high velocity trough at @xmath31 , which can be seen in the insert to figure 1 .",
    "we do not show the hires data since they do not reveal qualitatively different structure than the one seen in the insert .",
    "a  doublet structure in evident in the feature and the hires data confirm that the depth ratio of the two components is 1:1 , that is , complete saturation .",
    "this 1:1 depth ratio is caused by partial covering factor , which indicates that the absorption system is intrinsic .      in table 1",
    "we give the apparent column density measurements of the intrinsic absorption features for all the identified lines .",
    "apparent column density are derived by substituting the apparent optical depths of the troughs ( defined as @xmath32 , where @xmath23 is the normalized residual intensity seen in the trough ) in : @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the transition s wavelength and oscillator strength , and where the velocity is measured in .",
    "we note that the apparent column densities give good estimates for the real column densities only if the absorbing material covers the emission source completely and uniformly and where scattered - photons do not contribute appreciably to the residual intensity in the troughs ( see discussions in korista et al 1992 ; arav 1997 ) .",
    "otherwise , apparent column densities are only lower limits on the real ones ( arav et al 1999a , arav et al 1999b ) .",
    "we define @xmath36 ( where @xmath18 is the statistical weight , @xmath17 is the oscillator strength and @xmath1 is the transition s wavelengths ) as the strength factor of the line and give its value ( normalized to that of the strongest transition ; data from verner , verner & ferland 1996 ) . for the  lines we multiplied the expression in equation ( [ eq : column ] ) by the ratio of statistical weight of the lower level ( summed over all observed states ) to that of the specific state .",
    "this procedure yields independent estimates for @xmath37 from each transition provided the level populations are in lte.(see ",
    "2.6 ) . in  components @xmath25 and @xmath29 are embedded in a wide extension of component @xmath19 , their integration interval only covers the regions where these feature are distinctive , without compensation for the fact that some of the absorption is due to the wing of component @xmath19 . for the other lines the different absorption components are well separated , and therefore the integration over the components is straightforward . for the  measurments we corrected for the atmospheric absorption seen in the spectral region around the intrinsic @xmath38 line ( especially evident on the red side of component @xmath19 ,",
    "[ hires_he1 ] ) . the estimated error for each line",
    "is derived by performing the integration given in equation ( [ eq : column ] ) on two absorption free regions in the spectral vicinity of the measured features and taking the average of their absolute values .",
    "this procedure takes into account both signal - to - noise and continuum uncertainties .",
    "the error is formally derived for component @xmath19 and can be used as a conservative estimate for the other components since they are narrower . for  the error is significantly larger since we had to take the blending of the different components into account .",

    "we also note that the steep intensity drop on the red wing of the ly@xmath103  bel can be explained by a ly@xmath103  bal from the same system .    as evident from figure [ foc_linear_shift ] , there are differences in the shape of the absorption features in the foc data to the template , especially the  feature .",
    "some of these are caused by the much lower resolution of the foc spectrum .",
    "however , the fact that the  and  absorption features are more extensive than can be extrapolated from the  template is not unique .",

    "in   2 we established that the  and  absorption featured are not saturated , therefore their apparent column density measurements are the actual column densities of the absorber and not just lower limits . the importance of this verification can hardly be overstated . unless we have a direct evidence that a specific absorption trough in a quasar s outflow is not saturated",
    ", we must assume that it is , since in most cases where saturation diagnostics exist , we find that the troughs are indeed saturated ( arav 1997 ; telfer et al . 1998 ; arav et al . 1999a ; churchill et al . 1999 ; arav et al .",

    "@xmath108 depends linearly on @xmath109 , the atoms become more ionized with the increase of @xmath13 and a higher metalicity correlates linearly with higher @xmath108 for the metals . in all our models",
    "we assume solar metalicity .",
    "the elimination of this degree of freedom naturally tightens the constraints we derive for the ionization equilibrium . as we show below , models based on solar metalicity",

    "figure [ cloudy_u ] shows the relative @xmath108 as a function of @xmath13 for most of the ions we detect in the hires spectrum .",
    "the most important constraint arise from comparing the prediction and measurement for the ratio @xmath113 ( where @xmath42 designate  in the 2@xmath10s metastable level ) .",
    "when  is the dominant iron ion , we expect @xmath113 to be between 30100 since the solar abundance of iron is @xmath114 relative to hydrogen whereas that of the @xmath42 is only @xmath115 ( based on eq .",

    "since the observed @xmath117 is somewhat larger than @xmath37 we conclude that  can not be the dominant iron ion . from figure [ cloudy_u ]",
    "we deduce that the observed @xmath113 exclude models with @xmath118 .",
    "furthermore , the considerable difference in the slopes of @xmath37 and @xmath117 allows for only a narrow range around @xmath119 for acceptable models .",
    "what about the other observed ions ?",
    "the magnesium column densities fits very well into the above picture . comparing the measurements in table 1 to the models in figure [ cloudy_u ] we note that the observed @xmath120 can be reproduced by the models only in a narrow range of @xmath121 .",
    "the modeled @xmath122 are consistent with this picture since the measurements are only lower limits ( see   2.3 ) .",
    "for  we also get consistent results and the upper limit for @xmath123 is readily satisfied as long as @xmath124 , while the upper limit for @xmath125 necessitates @xmath126      although optically thin models can produce all the observed @xmath108 ratios , they have difficulties in explaining some of the measured column densities themselves , especially @xmath117 . for @xmath119 ,",
    "figure [ cloudy_u ] shows that @xmath127 , or using solar abundances @xmath128 .",
    "therefore , in order to produce the observed @xmath129 @xmath7 we need a total @xmath130 @xmath7 .",
    "this amount of @xmath131 produces a strong hydrogen ionization front ( i.e. , a region where the dominant hydrogen ion shifts from  to ) with @xmath132 for @xmath119 , thus invalidating our optically thin assumption .",
    "moreover , models with such a thick hydrogen ionization front can not produce the observed @xmath108 either .",
    "for the specific example above , the predicted @xmath113 is more than 100 times the observed one .",
    "figure [ cloudy_thick ] illustrates the situation for models with a hydrogen ionization front . prior to the development of the hydrogen ionization front , the relative column densities are similar to the ones in the optically thin models .",
    "we chose to present a model with @xmath119 since the predicted ratio @xmath113 agreed with the observed one in the optically thin part . behind the front the situation changes radically .",
    "the appearance of lines from the  2@xmath10s metastable level requires a significant fraction of  in the gas .",
    "however , in close proximity to the  ionization front we find a  ionization front making  the dominant helium species .",
    "therefore , the fraction of  behind a hydrogen ionization front decreases sharply and with it that of @xmath42 ( see eq.([eq : he_ratio ] ) ) .",
    "we note that the increase in the relative fraction of @xmath42 in the vicinity of the front is mainly due to the helium ionization transition . for optically thin models with @xmath119",
    "the more abundant helium ion is  ( although only by a factor 1.4 compared to ) . as the equilibrium shifts towards , at some point  becomes most abundant , which causes the abundance peak for the @xmath42 .",
    "as explained above , at a higher column density  become the dominant species accompanied by a sharp decline in the  fraction and hence in that of @xmath42 .    for the  lines",
    "the situation is quite the opposite .",
    "a hydrogen ionization front protects the  ions from photoionization and thus making it the dominant species . as a result ,",
    "almost all the iron behind the front is in the form of . in the example given in figure [ cloudy_thick ] the relative fraction of  increases by a factor of 300 across the front , whereas the fraction of  and with it that of @xmath42 decreases sharply behind the front .",
    "regardless to the @xmath13 value of the incident spectrum , a strong hydrogen ionization front always causes  to be the dominant iron species behind the front . since even under the most favorable conditions @xmath133 ( based on eq .",
    "[ [ eq : he_ratio ] ] , assuming solar abundances and the allowed temperature range discussed in ",
    "2.6 ) , we conclude that models with a hydrogen ionization front can not reproduce the observed  and @xmath42 column densities simultaneously .      from the analysis above we concluded that optically thin models have difficulties in reproducing the observed column densities while models with a hydrogen ionization front fail completely .",
    "the obvious thing to try next are models with an intermediate  optical depth ( @xmath134 of a few ) .",
    "we aim to find models that can yield the observed column densities of component @xmath19 ( see figs [ hires_he1 ] and [ hires_fe2 ] , and table 1 ) for which we have the most accurate measurements . in doing",
    "so we put most weight on the  and  results since we have direct evidence that the column densities we measure for these two ions are real ones and not lower limits .",
    "it is highly probable that the and  are also not saturated ( due to similarities with the  and  features , as well as their moderate depth ) , however we do not have direct diagnostics to confirm that .    in figure [ ionization_models ]",
    "we show the column density results from three models as well as the observed ones .",
    "in order to keep the models simple we used two agn continua given in the photoionization package cloudy ( ferland et al 1996 ; a full description is given in the `` hazy '' document which describes the code and is available at : http://nimbus.pa.uky.edu/cloudy/cloudy_94.htm ) . the `` table agn '' model",
    "is fully determined by the package and is described in detail in mathews and ferland ( 1987 ) . for the model which is a superposition of a black body `` big bump '' and various power laws",
    ", we used two settings : 1 ) the default parameter choices given in the hazy document , t=150,000 k , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 ; 2 ) t=100,000 k , @xmath138 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , which gives a somewhat lower temperature across the cloud .",
    "the average temperature for each model is given in table 3 , where the difference in temperature across each model is less than 15% .",
    "as noted above , the column densities are largely insensitive to variation of @xmath110 in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 to @xmath139 @xmath4 . for the presented models we chose @xmath110 value close to our -inferred lower limit , since they gave somewhat lower temperatures , in better agreement with the temperature constraints .",
    "the table agn and big bump models give excellent fits for the  and  column densities .",
    "the models over - predict @xmath140 by about a factor of three and give a reasonable fit for @xmath141 .",
    "although we did not include aluminum in figure [ ionization_models ] ( since we do not have high - resolution data for it ) , we note that these models also reproduce the apparent @xmath142 ( see table 2 ) to within a factor of two .",
    "the low abundance of aluminum ( @xmath143_{\\odot}=3\\times10^{-6})$ ] coupled with the inferred @xmath131 in the object , suggests a low level of saturation ( if any ) in the  absorption , thus implying that the apparent @xmath142 is a reasonable approximation for the actual one .    how does the presence of other flow components affect our ionization analysis ?",
    "although the measurements of components @xmath144 are not as accurate , it seems that their column density ratios , and therefore their ionization equilibrium , are similar to that of component @xmath19 .",
    "this situation argues in favor of models with with lower @xmath134 . a moderately strong @xmath134 ( @xmath145 ) in a given component will strongly attenuate the incident ionizing spectrum seen by components further from the central source . as a result",
    ", their ionization equilibrium will be different .",
    "if component @xmath19 is the furthest away from the source and is the only optically thick one , we still need fine tuning to have similar column density ratios in optically thin and optically thick slabs .",
    "the higher @xmath146 is , the more difficult it is to explain the similar ionization equilibrium in the other components . based on these arguments",
    "we prefer models that fits the data with the smallest @xmath146 .",
    "this is best achieved by choosing incident continuum that yields low temperature . as evident from equation ( [ eq : he_ratio ] ) , with all else equal , we get higher concentration of  in the 2@xmath10s level at lower temperatures . a smaller @xmath131 is then needed for a given @xmath117 , which leads to smaller @xmath134 .",
    "additional support for lower temperature models come from the  inferred t@xmath147  k ( see   2.6 ) .",

    "the reason for this is the small equivalent width of the  features , which in our case can only be detected with a combination of high s / n - high spectral resolution data . as we discuss in ",
    "2 the detection of  puts important constraints on photoionization models .",
    "it is therefore important to observe  balqsos at high spectral resolution in order to determine the existance of  in the intrinsic absorber .",
    "the ionization models account for the weakness of the  features compared to those of . for material optically thin at the lyman edge , figure [ cloudy_u ] shows that for a typical agn spectrum @xmath149 for @xmath150 ; this result also holds up to @xmath151 .",
    "thus , for @xmath152 the dominant magnesium ion in absorption is  with  showing roughly 1% of it s column density .",
    "that translates to a factor of 30 difference between the optical depths of  @xmath12796 and  @xmath12853 . if the  absorber is highly saturated we may detect  absorption even in low - resolution data , as is the case in qso  1044 + 3656 ( de kool et al . 2000 )",
    "otherwise , only high resolution data can reveal its existance in the deepest parts of the  troughs , which is the case in qso  23591241 . in order to detect  at @xmath153",
    "a hydrogen ionization front is needed ( voit , weymann & korista 1993 ) to keep the relative fraction of  ions high enough .",
    "but in that case , we should not expect to see absorption features .",
    "for example , a model using table agn continuum , @xmath154 @xmath7 ( a combination which produces a thick hydrogen ionization front ) and @xmath155 @xmath4 , predicts that behind the front 99% of the magnesium is in the form of  while only @xmath156 is in .",

    "1996 ) .",
    "what is the relationship between the low - ionization absorption ( , , ... ) and the high - ionization absorption ( , , ... ) that are seen in the spectrum of low - ionization balqsos ?",
    "voit , weymann & korista ( 1993 ) noted that the low - ionization absorption tends to concentrate at low ejection velocity compared to the high ionization absorption , where the latter normally encompass the velocity range of the former and extends to a much higher velocity .",
    "the best examples for that behavior are qso  00592735 and qso  1232 + 1325 . however , this is not always the case .",
    "qso  0932 + 5010 shows strong  absorption in its high velocity trough ( data courtesy of ray weymann and kirk korista ) and in qso  23591241 we observe a high velocity  trough at 5000 . as discussed in   3 ,",
    "our hst uv prism - spectroscopy data show a wide bal trough in both  and  ( fwhm @xmath104 ) , which encompasses both the high and low velocity troughs seen in .",
    "this relationship strongly suggests that the low - ionization absorption seen in qso  23591241 is indeed physically connected to the bal flow seen in the uv lines .",
    "it appears that a simple picture where the low ionization outflow is confined to low velocity does not hold . a more elaborate model , perhaps including ionization stratification ( arav et al .",
    "1999a ) , is called for .",
    "this picture is strengthen by the observation that in qso  00592735 there is a clear detection of @xmath157 bal ( turnshek et al .",
    "it is very difficult to construct a single - zone ionization model where significant optical depth arises from both  and .",
    "we point out that ionization models with large local density gradient give natural explanation for such occurrence ( arav 1996 ; arav et al .",
    "1999a ) since they allow for material with large variation in ionization parameter to exist at close proximity .",
    "the spectrum of qso  23591241 contains powerful diagnostics for the state of it s outflow .",
    "in particular we emphasize the importance of the  lines from the 2@xmath10s meta - stable level . under optimal conditions ,",
    "the abundance of this level is roughly 30 times lower than the abundances of iron and magnesium . detecting a somewhat higher column density of the  2@xmath10s meta - stable level than that",
    "of  indicates that 9599% of the the iron is in higher ionization stages and allows for tight constraints on the ionization parameter .",
    "the three well separated  lines also allow for an excellent saturation / covering - factor analysis , since their oscillator strength differ by a factor of six . with the combined constraints available from the  and  lines we are able to tightly constrain the ionization equilibrium in the flow ;",
    "reproduce the observed column densities without invoking departure from solar abundances ; and exclude a hydrogen ionization front in this outflow .    a strong connection between the low ionization absorber and the bal phenomenon is evident in the hst foc data .",
    "high ionization bals ( from ,  and ) are detected in the hst data and these encompass and expand the velocity range seen in the low ionization species .",
    "it will be very valuable to obtain better hst spectroscopy of the high ionization lines , as well as ground observations of the  @xmath11857 absorption .",
