    "the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) in the hole - doped perovskite manganites of the form la@xmath3a@xmath4mno@xmath2 ( a = ca , ba and sr ) has generated much interest @xcite .",
    "the parent compound lamno@xmath2 is an antiferromagnetic insulator , with a mn - o sublattice consisting of a network of corner - sharing mn@xmath5o@xmath6 octahedra .",
    "the mn@xmath5 ion has three @xmath7 electrons that form its s=3/2 core - spin and one additional electron in its higher energy , doubly - degenerate @xmath8 orbital .",
    "the jahn - teller distortion of the mno@xmath9 octahedron removes the degeneracy of the @xmath8 levels and the ground state consists of an ordered array of distorted octahedra with antiferromagnetic order of the mn spins . with substitution of trivalent la@xmath10 by divalent alkaline - earth metal ions such as ca@xmath11 , ba@xmath11 , or sr@xmath11 , holes are introduced into the material , producing mn@xmath12 ions where the @xmath8 orbital is unoccupied . with sufficient hole doping ( typically @xmath13 )",
    "the ground state becomes a magnetically isotropic ferromagnetic metal . in this regime",
    "the basic relationship between conductivity and ferromagnetism has been understood by the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism @xcite , in which itinerant @xmath8 electrons associated with the mn@xmath5 hop between the localized mn@xmath12 ions , providing both ferromagnetic exchange ( due to the strong hund s rule coupling between the @xmath14 and @xmath8 electrons ) and electrical conduction .",
    "the de interaction competes with a strong electron - phonon coupling via the jahn - teller active mn@xmath5 ions .",
    "the hopping of an electron , with its associated lattice distortion , forms a polaron .",
    "here we focus on the regime near optimal doping for ferromagnetism , where cmr is observed . at optimal doping",
    ", this competition produces a transition from the ferromagnetic - metallic ground state to an intrinsically inhomogeneous paramagnetic - insulating state at elevated temperatures , which is often described as polaronic @xcite .    for the prototype la@xmath0ca@xmath15mno@xmath2 ( lcmo )",
    "system the ferromagnetic state has been found to be truncated by the formation of static nanoscale lattice polarons,@xcite driving the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition first - order@xcite .",
    "these polarons@xcite make the system especially sensitive to applied magnetic fields , amplifying the magnetoresistivity near @xmath16 . in lcmo",
    ", polaron correlations develop within a narrow temperature regime as @xmath16 is approached from low temperatures , with a nanoscale correlation length that is only weakly temperature dependent .",
    "polarons take the form of ce - type correlations with an ordering wave vector of @xmath17 ( 1/4,1/4,0 ) ( with respect to the cubic perovskite cell ) .",
    "the static nature of these short range polaron correlations indicates the presence of a glass - like state @xcite .",
    "in addition , dynamic correlations exist with a comparable correlation length and with an energy distribution that is quasielastic .",
    "the elastic polaron scattering disappears at higher temperature , above which the correlations are purely dynamic @xcite .",
    "while these ce correlations characterize the insulating state above @xmath16 , the onset of ferromagnetism leads to their melting .    in the closely related la@xmath0ba@xmath1mno@xmath2 ( lbmo)@xcite and la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath18 ( lsmo)@xcite ferromagnets , on the other hand , the ferromagnetic transition is a conventional second - order one , and no polaron order",
    "is observed .  in the present work we have found that nanoscale polarons do indeed form in optimally doped lsmo and lbmo , well below @xmath16 , in the ferromagnetic state .",
    "however , these polarons are purely dynamic in nature , and never lock - in to the lattice to form an ordered state .",
    "the ferromagnetic state therefore survives their formation , and a conventional second - order transition is realized at higher temperatures , well above the temperature where the polarons form .",
    "the present results demonstrate that intrinsic inhomogeneities on a nanometer length scale are a universal feature of these ferromagnetic manganites , while the ferromagnetic state is only terminated if the polarons condense to form a ( static ) glass phase.@xcite",
    "elastic and inelastic neutron scattering measurements were carried out to study the polaron correlations in single crystals of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath19 and la@xmath0ba@xmath1mno@xmath2 weighting approximately 3 and 1 grams , respectively .",
    "these crystals have second - order ferromagnetic transitions as evidenced by the temperature dependence of the magnetic bragg peaks as well as the small wave vector spin wave dispersion data , and are the same crystals used in earlier studies , with @xmath16 s of 351 kdoloc1998 and 336 k,@xcite respectively .",
    "the neutron data were obtained on the bt-7 and bt-9 thermal triple axis spectrometers at the nist center for neutron research .",
    "we used pyrolytic graphite ( pg ) ( 002 ) monochromators and pg ( 002 ) analyzers .",
    "pg filters of 5 cm thickness were used to eliminate higher - order contamination . for bt-7 measurements , horizontal collimators with divergences of 100@xmath20 , 50@xmath20 , 50@xmath20 and 100@xmath20 full width at half maximum ( fwhm )",
    "were used before and after the monochromator , after the sample , and before the detector , respectively . for bt-9 measurements , collimations were 40@xmath20 - 47@xmath20 - 40@xmath20 - 80@xmath20 .",
    "samples were sealed in an aluminum can containing helium exchange gas and mounted in a closed cycle refrigerator operating over a temperature range from 10 k to 400 k. the crystal structure of lsmo and lbmo is orthorhombic , but only slightly distorted from the cubic lattice , and since the crystals are twinned for simplicity we label wave vectors in the reciprocal lattice units appropriate for pseudocubic unit cells with lattice parameters of a = 3.8660   and a = 3.9232   ( at 360 k ) for lsmo and lbmo , respectively .  in this notation",
    "the polaron correlations are observed around ( 1/4,1/4,0 ) and equivalent positions ( ce - type lattice correlations ) , in reciprocal lattice units ( rlu ) defined by @xmath21 .",
    "figure [ dynamic ] shows a color map of the neutron intensity above @xmath16 for each system as a function of ( @xmath22,e ) .",
    "we see that the dynamic correlations are observed and are peaked around the @xmath22 = ( 1.75,2.25,0 ) position , as expected for these ce - type lattice correlations .",
    "the intensity for lsmo has a broad maximum in energy , which can be seen more clearly in the energy scan shown in fig .",
    "[ dynamic](c ) . for lbmo",
    "this maximum occurs at a somewhat lower energy ( fig .",
    "[ dynamic](d ) ) .",
    "these data were taken with the same instrumental conditions , and recalling that the lsmo sample is 3@xmath23 larger than the lbmo sample , we see that the strength of the polaron scattering is comparable in the two systems .",
    "the scattering extends to low energies , and appears to consist of two components , a quasielastic component ( a lorentzian centered at e=0 ) and a component that has a broad maximum at finite energy .  at higher energies",
    "the scattering decreases fairly rapidly .",
    "the overall behavior is quite similar to the dynamics observed in lcmo@xcite , where again there is a quasielastic component to the scattering along with a component that peaks at finite energy .  in that case",
    "it was difficult to extract a quasielastic linewidth vs. temperature , in contrast to what was done for the lower @xmath16 bilayer system.@xcite this is because of the difficulty in establishing ` background ' at these elevated temperatures , as well as the difficulty in separating the ( apparent ) two components of the scattering .  in the present case",
    "the @xmath16 s are even higher than for lcmo , and hence it is even more difficult to extract detailed quasielastic linewidths as a function of @xmath24 .",
    "the general behavior , on the other hand , is clear .    to investigate the temperature dependence of the dynamic polaron correlations , @xmath22 scans around the ( 1/4,1/4,0 ) position",
    "were carried out for a series of energy transfers over a wide temperature range .",
    "the dynamic polaron scattering is very broad in energy , and broader than the instrumental resolution in @xmath22 as well .",
    "hence , it is generally better to use @xmath22-scans to measure the scattering since the scattering is confined to a relatively small range and the resolution does not vary over the scan .",
    "both the @xmath22-width and energy width of the measured peaks are not resolution limited , and @xmath22-scans can be performed in a wide energy range to observe the dynamic polaron correlations .",
    "[ tdep ] shows data as a function of @xmath22 = ( 1.5-@xmath25,1.5+@xmath25,0 ) for lsmo .  to search for static ce - type polaron correlations , extensive elastic scans ( e = 0 )",
    "were performed above and below @xmath16 .",
    "no evidence of ordered polarons was observed at any temperature , as indicated in the data shown in fig .",
    "[ tdep](a ) .",
    "this contrasts with the behavior of lcmo , where short - range static ce - type polaron correlations abruptly develop at @xmath16,@xcite and truncate the ferromagnetic state.adams2004 , lynn2007    the inelastic scattering , on the other hand , conveys a completely different story . at @xmath24 = 100 k and 200 k",
    "there is no evidence in lsmo of any peak in the scattering , with featureless scattering that is weakly temperature dependent and likely originates from multiphonon and multimagnon ( background ) scattering .  at 240 k",
    ", however , a distinct peak centered at @xmath26 @xmath27 ( 1.75,2.25,0 ) abruptly appears .",
    "note that this temperature is far below @xmath16 .",
    "the wave - vector width of this peak is approximately temperature and energy independent and corresponds to a correlation length of @xmath27 1 nm ( 10  ) .",
    "similar behavior is observed for lbmo , where fig .",
    "[ tdep](c ) shows @xmath22 scans measured at an energy transfer of e = 8 mev between @xmath24 = 100 k and 390 k. a peak in the scattering is observed at and above 150 k , while no peak is observed at lower @xmath24 .",
    "hence in both systems we observe the abrupt development of short - range dynamic polaron correlations well below @xmath16 , which evolve through @xmath16 without any apparent indication that long range ferromagnetic order has been lost .",
    "these dynamic correlations persist up to high temperatures , likely all the way up to the orthorhombic - rhombohedral transition.@xcite    the data in fig .",
    "[ tdep ] have been fit to a linear background plus a gaussian peak .  once the peak appears , its observed intensity increases with increasing @xmath24 and follows the thermal occupancy factor for a boson excitation .",
    "the results for the integrated intensities , after correcting for the bose thermal factor , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fitpara ] .",
    "fitpara(a , c ) shows that the inelastic scattering abruptly appears at a well defined temperature , and then is constant in strength",
    ".  therefore this overall scattering behaves as a phonon excitation .",
    "the width of the scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fitpara](b , d ) ) , once the intensity appears , is also independent of temperature .",
    "hence the correlation length in real space remains at @xmath28 throughout the entire temperature range where this scattering is observed .",
    "the development of static ce - type correlations has been shown to have important implications for the ferromagnetic to paramagnetic transition in the cmr manganites . when static polarons form in lcmo , electrons become trapped , driving the system into an insulating state ( hopping conductivity ) .",
    "the transition into the insulating state is accompanied by a truncation of the ferromagnetic state in a discontinuous fashion @xcite . above @xmath29 , the nature of",
    "the order is a polaron glass , in that the correlations are short range , and static.@xcite the short range correlations make the system especially sensitive to modest magnetic fields that can then drive the paramagnetic - insulating  ferromagnetic - metallic transition , with the concomitant large change in electrical conductivity @xcite . at sufficiently high",
    "@xmath24 the glass order disappears while dynamic polaron correlations persist as a polaron liquid . in lcmo",
    ", we observed a sharp phonon at 8 mev in the ferromagnetic metallic state below @xmath16 @xcite . above @xmath16 ,",
    "the phonon is still present , and interacts with the dynamic polarons .",
    "however , no such phonon is observed in this energy range in lsmo and lbmo .",
    "hence , the observed scattering is purely from the polaron correlations .",
    "in the course of the initial studies on lcmo,@xcite a search for these polarons peaks was made in lbmo and lsmo , but no static polaron correlations were found . indeed for the latter materials the ferromagnetic transition is a conventional second order one , with properties like the magnetization and spin wave stiffness quantitatively exhibiting scaling behavior,@xcite while the rather large changes in the resistivity can be understood on the basis of conventional electron scattering by magnetic fluctuations.@xcite the behavior of the resistivity is also different than for lcmo , which peaks at @xmath16 when the polarons develop .",
    "for lsmo @xmath30 increases with @xmath24 ( i.e. is metallic - like ) both below and above @xmath16,@xcite while for lbmo @xmath30 peaks , but only well above @xmath16.@xcite the polarons in lbmo and lsmo abruptly develop , but well below @xmath16 , and there is no obvious effect on the resistivity .",
    "the sizes of the polarons in all three systems are very similar as shown in table 1 , where the size has been taken from the width of the inelastic scattering .",
    "we note that the strength of the scattering , which is related to the number of polarons ( since the size is temperature independent ) , is also comparable in the three systems .",
    "hence it is not clear why only the polarons in lcmo lock - in to the lattice and truncate the ferromagnetic state , even though the polarons in lbmo and lsmo form at lower temperature ( particularly in comparison to @xmath29 ) but never lock - in .",
    "it is also not clear what is controlling the temperature of formation of the polarons , either static or dynamic , in these ferromagnetic metallic systems .",
    "we hope that the present studies will stimulate theoretical studies to address these issues .",
