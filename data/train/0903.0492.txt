    "anderson models on the lattice are discrete schrdinger operators with random potentials .",
    "such models have been studied since a long time in computational and theoretical physics , as well as in mathematics .",
    "one of the fundamental results for these models is the physical phenomenon of _",
    "localization_. there are various manifestations of localization : exponential decay of green s function , absence of diffusion , spectral localization ( meaning almost sure absence of continuous spectrum ) , exponential decay of generalized eigensolutions , or non - spreading of wave packets .",
    "such properties have been established exclusively ( apart from one - dimensional situations ) by two different methods , the multiscale analysis and the fractional moment method . the _ multiscale analysis _",
    "( msa ) was invented by frhlich and spencer in @xcite , while the _ fractional moment method _ ( fmm ) was introduced by aizenman and molchanov @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus our attention on correlated anderson models .",
    "more precisely , we develop the fmm for a one - dimensional discrete schrdinger operator with random potential of alloy - type . in this model ,",
    "the potential at the lattice site @xmath0 is defined by a finite linear combination @xmath1 of independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random coupling constants @xmath2 having a bounded density .",
    "the function @xmath3 is called single - site potential and may be interpreted as a finite interaction range potential associated to the lattice site @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , for the model under consideration the potential values at different sites are not independent random variables .",
    "let us stress that we have no sign assumption on the single - site potential , thus the correlations may be negative .    for such models we prove in one space dimension and at all energies a so - called fractional moment bound , i.e. exponential off - diagonal decay of an averaged fractional power of green s function .",
    "the restriction to the one - dimensional case allows an elegant and short proof in which the basic steps  decoupling and averaging  are particularly transparent .",
    "currently we are working on the extension of our result to the multi - dimensional case .    a second result concerns a criterion of exponential localization , i.e. the fact that in a certain interval there is no continuous spectrum and all eigenfunctions decay exponentially almost surely .",
    "our proof uses an idea developed first in the context of msa , but actually establishes exponential localization directly from fractional moment bounds on the green s function , without going through the induction step of the msa .",
    "let us discuss which localization results established previously apply to the case of correlated potentials .",
    "the papers @xcite and @xcite derive localization for anderson models with correlated potentials , using the msa or the fmm , respectively .",
    "however , all of them require quite stringent conditions on the conditional distribution of the potential value at a site conditioned on the remaining sites .",
    "these are typically not satisfied for the discrete alloy - type potential whenever the coupling constants are bounded random variables , cf . @xcite . thus , our results are not covered by those in @xcite .    for continuous alloy - type models spectral localization can be derived via msa , as soon as one has verified a wegner - type bound and an initial scale estimate .",
    "there are certain energy / disorder regimes where this has been achieved for sign - changing single - site potentials .",
    "all of them require that the random variables have a bounded density . for weak disorder @xcite",
    "establishes localization near non - degenerate simple band edges . for the bottom of the spectrum localization holds as well . in the case",
    "that the bottom of the spectrum is @xmath5 this has been proven in @xcite , while for lower bounded operators it follows from a combination of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related results , which however apply only to particular single - site potentials of a generalized step - function form . it should be emphasized that all these proof use monotonicity at some stage of the argument which is not the case for our proof of exponential decay of fractional moments .",
    "this is discussed in more detail below . in @xcite localization",
    "is established for alloy - type models on @xmath6 with sign - changing single - site potentials using genuinly one - dimensional techniques .",
    "thus these results are related to ours .",
    "however , to our knowledge , fractional moment bounds have not been established for alloy - type models with sign - changing single - site potential so far ( neither in the continuous nor the discrete setting ) .",
    "let us stress that even for models where the msa is well established , the implementation of the fmm gives new insights and slightly stronger results .",
    "for instance , the paper @xcite concerns models for which the msa was developed much earlier .",
    "we would like to bring one particular feature of our proof of exponential decay of fractional moments to the attention of the reader .",
    "contrary to standard proofs of localization either via multiscale analysis or via the fractional moment method this proof nowhere uses a monotonous spectral averaging , a monotonous wegner estimate , or any other kind of monotonicity argument . the key tool which allows us to disregard monotonicity issues is an averaging result for determinants , formulated in lemma [ lemma : det ] .",
    "let us elaborate on the role played by monotonicity in previous arguments in some more detail .",
    "the first approach to localization for alloy - type models which does not use monotonicity is the one pursued in @xcite .",
    "however , this method does not yield such a strong bound on the green s function as theorem [ thm : result1 ] below .",
    "furthermore , the method @xcite is based on the prfer coordinate , a quantity which is only defined for one - dimensional models . the fractional moment method is a tool suited for models in arbitrary dimension , albeit so far we have implemented in only in one dimension for our model .",
    "a result related to bounds on the fractional moments of the green s function is a wegner estimate .",
    "such estimates have been developed for alloy - type models with sign - changing single - site potentials .",
    "there are two methods at disposal to derive a wegner bound in this situation , one developed in @xcite and the other in @xcite .",
    "now both of them use monotonicity at some stage of the argument .",
    "let us first discuss aspects of the method in @xcite , restricting ourselves for simplicity to the energy region near the bottom of the spectrum .",
    "( @xcite have also results about internal spectral edges in the weak disorder regime . )",
    "there it is shown that negative eigenvalues of certain auxiliary operators have a negative derivative with respect to an appropriately chosen vector field .",
    "thus a monotonicity property is established for appropriately chosen spectral subspaces . on the other hand , the idea of @xcite consist in finding a linear combination of single - site potentials which is non - negative and averaging w.r.t .",
    "the associated transformed coupling constants .",
    "this is obviously again a monotonicity argument .",
    "recently bourgain @xcite has developed a method to establish wegner estimates for anderson models with matrix - valued potentials .",
    "these models , like ours , lack monotonicity . to overcome this difficulty bourgain uses analyticity and subharmonicity properties of the relevant matrix - functions .",
    "a key ingredient is ( a multidimensional version of ) cartan s theorem .",
    "if one likes , one can interpret our lemma [ lemma : det ] as a very specific and explicite version of cartan s theorem .",
    "using methods from dynamical systems sadel and schulz - baldes prove in @xcite positivity of lyapunov exponents and at most logarithmic growth of quantum dynamics for one - dimensional random potentials with correlations .",
    "however , due to the assumptions on the underlying probability space it seems that our model can not be reduced to the ones in @xcite . avila and damanik have related results as announced and sketched in @xcite .    finally , another recent development concerns localization results for discrete alloy - type models based on the msa .",
    "after the first version of the present paper was completed , veseli @xcite obtained a wegner estimate for the multi - dimensional analog of the model considered in this paper , which can be used to obtain exponential spectral localization at large disorder .",
    "for this results the distribution of the coupling constants has to satisfy an analog of condition ( a ) in theorem 2.2 .",
    "below . in a preprint",
    ", of which we learned after the final version of our paper was submitted , krger @xcite obtained results about spectral and dynamical localization for a class of multi - dimensional models which includes ours as a subclass .",
    "this work uses some of the ideas of @xcite mentioned above and establishes wegner - like estimates without the use of monotonicity .",
    "we consider a one - dimensional anderson model . this is the random discrete schrdinger operator @xmath7 acting on @xmath8 , the space of all square - summable sequences indexed by @xmath9 with an inner product @xmath10 . here",
    ", @xmath11 denotes the discrete laplace operator and @xmath12 is a random multiplication operator .",
    "they are defined by @xmath13 and represent the kinetic energy and the random potential energy , respectively .",
    "we assume that the probability space has a product structure @xmath14 and is equipped with the probability measure @xmath15 where @xmath16 with @xmath17 = 1 .",
    "hence , each element @xmath18 of @xmath19 may be represented as a collection @xmath20 of i.i.d .",
    "random variables , each distributed with the density @xmath21 .",
    "the symbol @xmath22 denotes the expectation with respect to the probability measure , i.e. @xmath23 . for a set @xmath24 , @xmath25 denotes the expectation with respect to @xmath2 , @xmath26 .",
    "that is , @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "let the _ single - site potential _ @xmath29 be a function with finite and non - empty support @xmath30 .",
    "we assume that the random potential @xmath31 has an alloy - type structure , i.e. @xmath32 at a lattice site @xmath33 is a linear combination of the i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath2 , @xmath34 , with coefficients provided by the single - site potential . for this reason we call the hamiltonian sometimes a discrete alloy - type model .",
    "the function @xmath3 may be interpreted as a finite range potential associated to the lattice site @xmath34 .",
    "the hamiltonian is possibly unbounded , but self - adjoint on a dense subspace of @xmath8 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "finally , for the operator @xmath35 in and @xmath36 we define the corresponding _ resolvent _ by @xmath37 . for the _ green s function _ , which assigns to each @xmath38 the corresponding matrix element of the resolvent",
    ", we use the notation @xmath39 for @xmath24 , @xmath40 denotes the dirac function given by @xmath41 for @xmath26 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "the quantities @xmath44 and ( in the case that @xmath21 is weakly differentiable ) @xmath45 may be understood as a measure of the disorder present in the model ( a small value of norms corresponds to the strong disorder ) .",

    "we can actually apply theorems [ thm : result1 ] and [ thm : result2 ] to arbitrary @xmath59 with @xmath65 .",
    "in this situation a translation of the indices of the random variables @xmath20 by @xmath66 transforms the model to the case @xmath56 and @xmath57 . note that @xmath67 and @xmath68 are well defined since @xmath69 is finite .",
    "[ remark : localization ]    a.   our proof gives estimates about fractional moments of _ certain _ matrix elements of the resolvent for somewhat more general models .",

    "it follows directly from the iterative application of lemma [ lemma : finitness1 ] that for all @xmath85 and for the constant @xmath86 defined in we have @xmath87 a decomposition of the type @xmath70 is implicitly used in the proof of theorem [ thm : result2 ] , given in section  [ sec : gen ] .",

    "c.   thus in this situation we have full control over fractional moments , which for the usual anderson model with i.i.d .",
    "potential values suffices to prove spectral and dynamical localization .",
    "however , for our model neither dynamical nor spectral localization can be directly inferred using the existent methods in @xcite , see section  [ sec : loc ] .",
    "the reason is that the random variables @xmath94 , @xmath33 , are not independent , while the dependence of @xmath35 on the i.i.d .",

    "d.   in section  [ sec : loc ] we provide a new criterion for spectral localization without applying the multiscale analysis .",

    "in fact it can be extended to more general random potentials , as long as the correlation length is finite .",
    "e.   in this context it is natural to ask whether it is possible to extract a positive part from the random potential in such a way , that the original methods for deriving fractional moment bounds apply .",
    "it turns out that this is not possible in general ( even in one space dimension ) , but that the corresponding class of single - site potentials can be characterized in the following way : if the polynomial @xmath96 does not vanish on @xmath97 it is possible to extract from @xmath90 a positive single - site potential with certain additional properties . in this situation",
