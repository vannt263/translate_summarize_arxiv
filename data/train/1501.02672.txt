    "in the examination of shapiro steps , finding the best method or tool to verify their presence has been the matter of many studies in various physical systems .",
    "numerous theoretical and experimental results on shapiro steps obtained in dissipative systems such as charge- or spin - density waves conductors @xcite , the systems of josephson junction arrays @xcite and superconducting nanowires @xcite have been the main impulse and motivation for our studies of the ac+dc driven overdamped ( dissipative ) frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model @xcite . it is well known that when these systems are subjected under an external ac driver , their dynamics is characterized by the appearance of shapiro steps .",
    "these steps are due to interference phenomena or dynamical mode - locking ( synchronization ) of the internal frequency with the applied external one .",
    "if the locking appears at the integer values of the external frequency , the steps are called harmonic while for the locking at rational ( noninteger ) values of frequency they are called subharmonic .    in realistic systems due to presence of noise , impurities and other environmental effects , detection of shapiro steps , particularly the subharmonic ones , is usually very difficult . on the other hand , in theoretical works , their observation could also be a problem since their size is often so small that they are invisible on the regular plot of the response function .",
    "one of the most sensitive ways to verify the existence of shapiro steps is the calculation of _ the largest lyapunov exponent _ @xcite .",
    "always when the system is dynamically mode - locked , the largest lyapunov exponent has negative values @xcite .",
    "therefore , an examination of the largest lyapunov exponent for some interval of driven force will precisely reveal the presence of any harmonic or subharmonic mode - locking .",
    "calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent has been already used as a way to examine the existence of subharmonic shapiro steps in the standard fk model @xcite .",
    "the standard frenkel - kontorova ( fk ) model represents a chain of harmonically interacting particles subjected to a sinusoidal substrate potential @xcite .",
    "it describes different commensurate or incommensurate structures that under an external driving force , show very rich dynamical behavior . in the presence of an external ac+dc driving force",
    ", the dynamics is characterized by the appearance of the staircase macroscopic response or the shapiro steps in the response function @xmath0 of the system @xcite .",
    "though the standard fk model has been very successful in the studies of some effects related to shapiro steps , its applications is still very restricted .",
    "namely , in the standard fk model , the subharmonic steps either do not exists in the case of commensurate structures with integer values of winding number @xcite or their size is so small that analysis of their properties is very difficult @xcite .",
    "the absence of subharmonic steps for the commensurate structures with integer value of winding number , and their presence in the case of rational ( noninteger ) winding number was confirmed by the calculation of the largest lyapunov exponent @xcite .",
    "however , contrary to the standard case , the large subharmonic steps can appear in any commensurate structure of the nonstandard fk model such as the one with the asymmetric deformable substrate potential ( asdp ) @xcite .",
    "this potential belongs to the family of nonlinear periodic deformable potentials , introduced by remoissent and peyrard @xcite as the way to model many specific physical situations without employing perturbation methods .    in this paper , by using the largest lyapunov exponent computation technique , we will examine the appearance of both harmonic and subharmonic steps in the fk model with asymmetric deformable substrate potential ( asdp ) . in the analysis of the largest lyapunov exponent , we have observed one interesting property :",
    "the shapiro steps and their relative sizes appear according to the _ farey construction _ only in the standard regime when large harmonic steps are dominant in the response function .",
    "the paper is organizes as follows .",
    "the model and methods are introduced in sec .",
    "ii , and the results are discussed in sec .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv concludes the paper .",
    "we consider the dissipative ( overdamped ) dynamics of a series of coupled harmonic oscillators @xmath1 subjected in the asdp : @xmath2 } { \\left [ 1 + r^2 + 2r\\cos ( \\pi u)\\right ] ^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the pinning strength , and @xmath4 is the shape or deformation parameter ( @xmath5 which can be varied continuously . by changing the shape parameter @xmath4",
    "the potential can be tuned in a very fine way , from the simple sinusoidal one for @xmath6 to deformable for @xmath7 . in fig",
    "[ fig1 ] , the commensurate structure @xmath8 in asdp is presented for two different values of the shape parameter @xmath6 and @xmath9 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",

    "particles are represented by red dots.,width=226 ]    the average interparticle distance @xmath11 , or the so called winding number is one of the main parameters that describes the fk model .",
    "the system exhibits commensurate phase for rational values of winding number @xmath12 , and incommensurate phase for irrational ones .    in the present paper ,",
    "the system of coupled harmonic oscillators in asdp is driven by the dc+ac forces @xmath13 .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath14 where @xmath15 , @xmath1 is the position of @xmath16th particle , @xmath17 is dc force , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the amplitude and the circular frequency of the ac force , respectively . since the substrate potential is homogeneous ( it does not depend of the particles index @xmath16 ) relabeling of the position of particles will not change the properties of the configuration @xcite . when the system is driven by an external ac+dc force ,",
    "two different frequency scales appear in the system : the frequency of the external periodic force @xmath20 , and the characteristic frequency of the motion of particles over the asdp driven by the average force @xmath17 .",
    "the competition between those frequency scales can result in the appearance of resonance ( dynamical mode locking or shapiro steps ) .",
    "solution of the system ( [ u ] ) is called resonant if average velocity @xmath21 satisfies the relation : @xmath22 where triplet ( @xmath23 ) are integers numbers .",
    "resonant velocity is called harmonic if @xmath24 and subharmonic if @xmath25 .",
    "( in case of @xmath26 we can use @xmath27 for marking harmonic and subharmonic steps ) .",

    "the triplet is not unique ( this triplet is unique only for incommensurate structures @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will consider only the commensurate structure @xmath35 .",

    "the force is varied adiabatically with the step @xmath38 .",
    "we shall be focused on calculating the largest lyapunov exponent @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the lyapunov exponent gives a quantitative measure on the presence of chaos in dynamical systems @xcite , however , it also proves to be extremely sensitive to the existence of both harmonic and subharmonic shapiro steps .",
    "when the system is dynamically mode locked , i.e. on the step , the trajectories of particles are periodic in time which is reflected by the negative value of the largest lyapunov exponent .",
    "outside the steps , where there is no onset of dynamical mode locking , the trajectories are quasi - periodic which is confirmed by the zero of the lyapunov exponent ( @xcite ) .",
    "we choose an appropriate perturbed point @xmath40 in our computations according to : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is time when the steady - state has been achieved in our system , and @xmath43 is the parameter that expresses the change in the initial positions of particles of the model . in order to make sure that projecting is always done onto the subspace dominated by the largest lyapunov exponent , the sign in front of the square term in eq.[lap ] is randomly selected where the plus and minus sign appear with the same probability .",
    "we sample and readjust following sprott @xcite every 25 or so time steps . in our calculations , we used @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for convenience , in further text , the largest lyapunov exponent will be denoted just as the lyapunov exponent .",

    "domain of @xmath17 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , for which we calculated the exponent , differs with @xmath4 due to the fact that for different values of @xmath4 the same steps appear in different regions of @xmath17 ( see @xcite ) . in the standard case in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) , we can see the large minima which correspond to harmonic steps and which size changes monotonically . as deformation increases in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , the minima which corresponds to the large halfinteger and higher order subharmonic steps appear where the changing of their size is not monotonic any more .    using the eq.([vel ] ) , the shapiro steps could be now identified .",
    "it is well known that in the standard fk model ( @xmath6 ) with integer value of winding number , there would be no subharmonic mode locking @xcite , and consequently , no steps between harmonic ones on the plot of response function @xmath50 . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath51 , only halfinteger step @xmath52 which appears between the first and the second harmonic could be visible @xcite .",

    "this result is obtained in @xcite.,width=226 ]    the areas under the minima correspond to the size of the steps , i.e. for larger step , the area under the minimum will be larger . if we examine the subharmonic steps in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we could see that the first largest fractional step between the step @xmath53 and the step @xmath54 is the step @xmath52 .",
    "then , the largest step between the steps @xmath53 and @xmath52 would be the step @xmath55 while the largest one between the steps @xmath52 and @xmath54 is @xmath56 . therefore , according to the appearance of fractional steps between the first @xmath57 and the second @xmath58 harmonics we may write the following sequence :    @xmath59    this sequence of numbers represents the _ farey sequence _ well known in number theory @xcite .",
    "the farey sequence @xmath60 of order @xmath61 is an ascending sequence of irreducible fractions between @xmath62 and @xmath53 , whose denominators are less or equal then @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "the first few would be : @xmath63 therefore , if we have two rational fractions in farey sequence @xmath64 ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 are coprime integers ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66,@xmath67 are coprime integers ) , the rational fraction which lies between them and has the smallest denominator is @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 are coprime integers .",
    "this statement is trivially extended to the case of interval between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , and further on ( theorems @xmath71 and @xmath72 in @xcite ) . the largest step between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , if exists , will be step @xmath73 .",
    "the farey sequence could be easily understood from the diagram in fig .",

    ", width=226 ]    for example , in the case of the fk model with the integer value of winding number , there is no subharmonic mode locking , which implies there is only the farey sequence of order one .",
    "however , if the winding number is rational noninteger such as the case @xmath51 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , one can see that the largest step between harmonic steps @xmath53 and @xmath54 is halfinteger step @xmath52 . from the set theory @xcite we know that between any two rational fractions lie countable many , @xmath74 rational fractions and therefore , countable many possible shapiro steps between any two harmonic steps in our model .    if the potential gets deformed , the large halfinteger step and higher order subharmonic steps appear @xcite .",

    "the size of halfinteger steps decreases , and the most of higher order subharmonic steps have completely vanished @xcite .",

    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "deformation of the potential obviously strongly affects the steps as we can see in fig .",
    "[ fig6]-[fig8 ] .",
    "it appears that with the increase of the deformation @xmath4 , the right side of the farey construction is heavily favored over the left one . in particular",
    ", we observe that at each level of our binary tree graph ( farey construction in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) the child node ( or step ) that takes preference is the one on the right .",
    "this means that with the increase of the deformation the steps that are present and become increasingly dominant are @xmath77 .",
    "we have analyzed also the systems with other types of deformable potentials @xcite , such as variable , double barrier and double well potential , and we have been always able to observe the appearance of steps in accordance with the farey construction @xcite .",
    "therefore , for two steps @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the next largest step between them will be @xmath78 where denominator determines the size of steps in terms that the size of steps decreases as the denominator increases .",
    "it is important to note that farey construction tell us the order and the relative sizes of steps but it does not tell us the actual step width or why they appear @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the size of harmonic and halfinteger steps are correlated , whereby the larger the size of harmonic the smaller the one of halfinteger step and vice versa @xcite .",
    "in some cases , depending on the system parameters , the size of halfinteger steps could be even larger than the size of harmonic ones @xcite .",
    "the size of halfinteger and other subharmonic steps strongly affects the behavior of the system , and according to that in previous works @xcite , the three different types of system behavior have been classified : the standard behavior for small halfinteger steps , the behavior for intermediate halfinteger steps and the behavior in the presence of large halfinteger steps .",
    "if we have two harmonic steps , according to farey sequence the next largest step which appears between them is the halfinteger step , but this is not the case for nonstandard behavior @xcite , since halfinteger steps are larger than harmonic ones . in such case , could we still have the presence of farey sequence ? in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , the response function in the case of large halfinteger steps is presented .     the average velocity as a function of average driving force for @xmath79 , and @xmath80 ( the rest of parameters are as in fig . [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the numbers mark halfinteger and subharmonic steps.,width=226 ]    it is obvious that in the nonstandard case , the relative sizes of harmonic and halfinteger steps do not follow the farey construction , and going from harmonic to halfinteger steps , the size of step does not decreases as denominator increases , on the contrary , the halfinteger steps @xmath81 and @xmath52 are larger than harmonic ones @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "however , the higher order subharmonic steps between halfinteger and harmonic steps still appear according to farey construction and their sizes decrease as the denominator increases .    calculation of the lyapunov exponent gives a possibility not only to detect all resonances in the response function , but also to detect the presence of chaos . in all our simulations performed on the ac+dc driven overdamped fk model",
    "we did not observed any chaos .",
    "presence of deformable substrate potentials and different level of deformations did not introduced chaotic behavior into the system .",
    "contrary to our case , chaos has been observed in the spatiotemporal dynamics of moving kinks in the damped dc driven fk model where the resonances appear due to competitions between the moving kinks and their radiated phase modes @xcite .",
    "also , structured chaos has been observed in a josephson junction systems where chaotic regions appear between the subharmonic shapiro steps at certain values of system parameters @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we have presented detailed analysis of the shapiro steps in the ac+dc driven dissipative fk model by using the lyapunov computation technique .",
    "the obtained results show the presence of farey sequence in the appearance of subharmonic steps .",
    "the steps and their relative sizes follow exactly the farey construction only in the standard regime when harmonic steps are the largest one . however , in the nonstandard regime , the halfinteger steps are larger than harmonic ones , and farey sequence appears only in the order and relative sizes of higher order subharmonic shapiro steps . lyapunov exponent analysis is certainly one of the best ways to get an accurate answer about the presence of chaos in the system",
    ". computations of lyapunov exponent have been performed for different system parameters , and regardless of the deformation , no chaos has been observed in the behavior of the system .",
    "absence of chaos in the presence of deformable potentials certainly requires further investigation . this problem and",
    "the possibility of chaotic behavior in other situations such as presence of noise will be subject of future examinations .",
    "presented results could be important for the studies of shapiro steps in all systems that are closely related to the dissipative dynamics of the fk model . in experimental and theoretical works performed in charge density wave systems and the systems of josephson junction arrays ,",
    "measuring of differential resistance is usually used to detect subharmonic steps .",
    "if we look for example at the results obtained in sliding charge - density wave systems @xcite , the systems of josephson junction arrays @xcite or superconduction nanowires @xcite , we can observe the presence of farey construction in the appearance of shapiro steps .",
    "our analysis shows that farey construction can not be always generally applied when it comes to relative sizes of the observed steps . since the appearance and origin of the subharmonic shapiro steps are still a matter of debates , we hope that these results could bring an insight into understanding of these physical phenomena .",
