    "a paradigm is beginning to emerge that links galaxy mergers , starbursts , qsos , and the formation of spheroids in galaxies into a single coherent picture that promises to explain a range of disparate phenomena connected to galaxy formation and evolution ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in outline ,",
    "galaxy mergers involving gas - rich galaxies drive gas into the center of the resulting merger remnant , fueling both a starburst and the black hole that results from the merger of the central black holes of the merging galaxies .",
    "initially , both the resulting qso activity and much of the starburst are hidden at optical wavelengths by enshrouding dust , but eventually the strong outflow from the qso clears a path along at least some sightlines @xcite .",
    "this same outflow , however , also clears out much of the gas that is feeding both the starburst and the qso activity , quenching both within a relatively short time and providing a self - limiting mechanism for the growth of both the black hole and the stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "this removal of the gas feeding the black hole also means that the optically luminous phase of the qso is necessarily brief , @xmath2@xmath3 years .",
    "the coupling between black - hole growth and star formation provides a plausible explanation for the correlation between black - hole mass and spheroidal velocity dispersion @xcite , and relations between the qso luminosity and the strength of the outflow may also explain the shape of the qso luminosity function @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there may be a link between the qso and merging galaxy luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "this close relationship between gas - rich mergers and nuclear activity is supported by evidence for recent starbursts in galaxies with high - luminosity agn @xcite .",
    "however , it is seemingly difficult to reconcile such star formation with claims that most qsos in the low - redshift universe are found in normal ellipticals with stellar populations overwhelmingly dominated by old stars @xcite . indeed",
    ", much skepticism remains concerning the relevance of major mergers ( and their ensuing starbursts ) in the triggering of agn activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although many agree that mergers do play an important role for higher luminosity agn , such as qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ".    given that determining the relationship between mergers and the qso population has important consequences in our understanding of galaxy evolution , it is pertinent to revisit the question whether or not qso hosts have populations indicative of merger - induced starbursts .",
    "@xcite studied the morphologies of five low - redshift qso host galaxies that had been previously classified as undisturbed elliptical galaxies using deep ( 5 orbit ) hubble space telescope ( @xmath4 ) advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images .",
    "they found that , while the hosts are reasonably fit by a de vaucouleurs profile , they also show significant tidal debris indicative of a merger event within the last @xmath5 gyr .",
    "following @xcite , we now turn to the stellar populations in these and other similar bulge - dominated qso host galaxies . using high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) , deep keck spectroscopy , we model the stellar populations to search for traces of significant starburst episodes in the recent past . in section  [ observations ]",
    "we describe the sample , spectroscopic observations , and data reduction . in section  [ modeling ]",
    "we describe our modeling strategy and consider possible caveats , while in section  [ compare ] we compare our results to those of similar studies . in section  [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the interpretation of our results in the framework of galaxy evolution . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume a cosmological model with @xmath6 kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "our sample is drawn from the sample of 23 ( 10 radio - loud and 13 radio - quiet ) qsos of @xcite .",
    "this sample contains radio - loud and radio - quiet qsos in the redshift range of @xmath10 that are matched in optical luminosity . for details of the original sample selection ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite performed a morphological study of this sample based on @xmath4 images and concluded that all of the host galaxies having nuclei in the qso luminosity range are bulges that have properties `` indistinguishable from those of quiescent , evolved , low - redshift ellipticals of comparable mass '' @xcite .",
    "similarly , by studying the stellar populations using spectroscopy obtained with 4-m class telescopes @xcite , @xcite conclude that these galaxies are dominated by truly old stellar populations with no significant episodes of star formation in the more recent past .",
    "for this paper , we obtained spectra of as many of the 23 qsos as we were able to observe during our runs , giving priority to those objects classified as ellipticals by @xcite .",
    "the 17 targets that we observed are listed in table  [ journal ] , along with their host galaxy redshifts as measured from absorption lines in our spectra .",
    "we use the iau designation listed in this table to refer to any given object throughout the paper .",

    "for the blue side ( lris - b ) , we used either the 400 groove mm@xmath7 grism blazed at 3400  or the 600 groove mm@xmath7 grism blazed at 4000   yielding dispersions of 1.09  pixel@xmath7 and 0.63  pixel@xmath7 , respectively . for the red side ( lris - r ) , we used either the 300 groove mm@xmath7 grating blazed at 5000  or the 400 groove mm@xmath7 grating blazed at 8500 , yielding dispersions of 2.55    pixel@xmath7 and 1.86    respectively .",
    "the slit was 1  wide , projecting to @xmath127 pixels on uv- and blue - optimized ccd on lris - b and @xmath125 pixels on the tektronix 2048@xmath132048 ccd on lris - r .",
    "a few of the objects were observed with a set up that resulted in a gap of a few hundred angstroms between the blue and red sides .",
    "we obtained between two and six exposures for each host galaxy , typically 1800  s each , dithering along the slit between exposures .",
    "a spectrum of the qso nucleus for each object was obtained separately , with total integration times between 600 and 1200  s , depending on the magnitude of each qso , so as to obtain a s / n @xmath14 100 .",
    "the typical seeing for all observations was 07 in @xmath15 .",
    "four or five spectrophotometric standards from @xcite were observed each night for flux calibration .",
    "objects 0157 + 001 and 1012 + 008 were observed with the old lris ( single camera ) on the keck  ii telescope on ut 1997 september 13 and 1998 april 6 , respectively .",

    "[ journal ] we show a complete journal of observations , including slit positions , total exposure times , and wavelength resolutions for the blue and red sides , respectively .    the slit was placed offset from the nucleus for each object , with a separation that depended on the brightness of the qso and the seeing conditions , so as to minimize the contamination from qso light .",
    "thus , the spectra that we obtained correspond to regions of the host galaxy at a given distance from the center , as listed in table  [ journal ] . for two objects , 1012 + 008 and 1635 + 119",
    ", we placed the slit through the nucleus .",
    "however , the spectra that we recovered corresponded to regions at a distance @xmath165 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the majority of objects were observed near transit to minimize the effects of differential atmospheric refraction . in a few cases when",
    "the objects were observed at somewhat higher airmasses ( 1.1 to 1.4 ) , shorter exposures at parallactic angle were obtained to correct the continuum of the qso and the host galaxy .",
    "only one object , 0204 + 292 , was observed at high airmass ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "spectra were reduced using standard procedures and corrected for galactic reddening using the values given by ned , which are calculated following @xcite . for each object , a scaled version of the qso spectrum",
    "was subtracted from that of the host galaxy . in order to model the contribution of the qso to the host galaxy spectrum at each wavelength",
    ", we obtained spectra of bright standard stars by placing the slit at several distances from the star and at different angles to simulate our off - nuclear observations of the host galaxies .",
    "we then multiplied the spectrum of each qso by the corresponding model .",
    "finally , we scaled the model of the qso contribution for each object by measuring the flux in broad lines in the spectrum of the host and subtracted it from the latter . the precise determination of the scaling of the qso spectrum was an iterative process where we tested a range of factors until we obtained clearly over- and under - subtracted host spectra .",
    "we used these extreme cases to determine the effects of the uncertainty introduced by the subtraction of the qso light from the hosts on the modeling of the stellar populations , as described below .",
    "the qso contribution to the observed host spectrum that was subtracted , as measured at rest wavelength 4500  , is listed as a percentage value in table  [ ages ] .",
    "the red - side spectrum of 0244 + 194 was corrupted , so we only used the blue - side spectrum when modeling stellar populations . as mentioned above ,",
    "0204 + 292 was observed at high airmass and the host galaxy spectrum suffered from strong contamination from the qso that we were not able to model appropriately .",
    "therefore , we were unable to recover a clean spectrum of the host galaxy .",
    "for this reason , this object was not included in the analysis .",
    "the spectrum of the host galaxy of 1549 + 023 was also too noisy to be modeled and it is also excluded from the analysis .",
    "our final sample thus consists of 15 objects .",
    "several different strategies for modeling stellar populations in qso and other agn host galaxies have been developed over the last two decades . some authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use the seds and colors of hosts obtained from images , while others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) use diagnostic diagrams such as the @xmath17(4000)/h@xmath18 plane .",
    "although these techniques are powerful to analyze large samples of galaxies , they could potentially be vulnerable to degeneracies , such as the age - metallicity degeneracy , and contamination by scattered qso light ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "there are relatively few studies in the literature that include modeling of absorption - line spectroscopy of qso hosts . even in those few studies ,",
    "the techniques employed are vastly different .",
    "for example , @xcite model off - nuclear spectra of qso hosts in the @xcite sample using stellar synthesis models .",
    "they use the nuclear spectrum of one of the qsos in the sample to account for qso light contamination , and they fix a 0.1 gyr population to account for any recent star formation that may have occurred .",
    "they then vary the age of the old underlying population and determine the relative contribution between the older and the younger populations .",
    "one problem with this method is that the spectra of younger populations change much more rapidly with age than those of older populations .",
    "whereas the seds and stellar features change vastly from 0 to 1 gyr , they remain almost unchanged for ages greater than 6 gyr , and the only parameter that changes significantly is the contribution by mass to the spectrum .",
    "thus , this method is prone to result in more degeneracies , and it is unable to determine the actual age and contribution of the younger population . not surprisingly , they find that the host galaxies are dominated by old stellar populations with a very small contribution of the 0.1 gyr population    @xcite do a more detailed modeling of the off - nuclear spectra of ten qsos .",
    "their fitting method is based on that of @xcite : they fit simultaneously instantaneous burst models of 15 different ages ranging from 0.001 to 13 gyr .",
    "in addition , they account for scattered qso light and reddening .",
    "in contrast to the results by @xcite , they find an average light - weighted age of 2 gyr for the host galaxies in their sample .",
    "our approach is a simplified version of the technique used by @xcite .",
    "the main question we want to answer is whether the host galaxies were formed at high redshift , with their populations only passively evolving , or whether there have been any significant episodes of star formation in the more recent past .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to employ a method that we have used in the past @xcite which has proved to be very robust .",
    "we assume an old stellar population ( with a fixed age ) corresponding to the populations existing in the host galaxy or galaxies . to this",
    ", we add a younger stellar population representing a star forming event in the more recent past .",
    "we then vary the relative contribution of the two stellar populations and the age of the younger population , and we perform a least square fit to the observed data , masking out regions of obvious emission lines and any regions showing excessive noise , and giving a lower relative weight to regions that contained pure stellar continuum , i.e. , no absorption features .",
    "a clear advantage of this method is that there are only two free parameters and thus we encounter fewer degeneracies .",
    "we typically assume the old population to be a 10 gyr - old population , although we have found that the precise choice of the older population has no significant effect on the age of the younger population determined from the best fit .",
    "however , the choice of the old population does have an effect on the determination of the relative contribution between the older and younger populations , in the sense that over - estimating the age of the older population will result into an over - estimation of the contribution of the younger population and vice versa .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is of the order of a few percent , even when the age of the old population is varied by as much as five gyr .",
    "we use the stellar population synthesis models by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* heareafter bc03 ) because they provide a good match to the spectral resolution of our data and allow us to test the effects of varying a wide range of metallicities .",
    "they are also widely used in the literature and allow for us to readily compare our results to those of previous studies . while a recent study by @xcite indicates that the bc03 models are still the most successful at reproducing the observed seds and features of post - starburst galaxies , we have chosen to also use two other sets of models that include different agb star prescriptions : those by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter m05 ) and s.  charlot & g.  bruzual ( 2007 , private communication ; hereafter cb07 ) .",
    "as we discuss below , we find remarkable consistency in the results obtained with the three sets of models .",
    "the description of the fitting and analysis below refers to the bc03 models , unless otherwise specified .    in carrying out the fitting procedure , we smoothed the models to match the velocity dispersion of the host galaxies and the various resolutions of the spectra .",
    "velocity dispersions were determined by using the penalized pixel - fitting procedure ( ppxf ) of @xcite .",
    "we followed their prescription for adjusting the bias parameter , although , for our spectra , the results were not particularly sensitive to this choice .",
    "although the uncertainties in the determination of the qso contribution to the host spectrum ( listed in table  [ ages ] ) are only of the order of a few percent , they could have an effect in the determination of the age of the stellar populations . in order to estimate the magnitude of this effect , we created versions of host spectra in which the qso contribution was clearly under- and over - subtracted , and we modeled these extreme spectra .",
    "the best - fit stellar population ages determined for the under- and over - subtracted spectra were somewhat different from those determined for the spectra with the best qso subtractions , but the difference was typically smaller than the 68% confidence intervals in the fits given in table  [ ages ] .",
    "moreover , the @xmath19 of the best fits in the extreme spectra was significantly greater .",
    "many of the spectra of the individual objects show narrow emission lines . in most cases ,",
    "the emission lines come from gas ionized by the qso in the extended narrow line region ( nlr ) .",
    "however , in a few cases ( discussed in more detail in the appendix ) , we see [ ] @xmath203727 even when [ ] is weak or absent",
    ". this may be indicative of a small amount of current star formation or low velocity shocks in these hosts .",
    "the presence of narrow emission lines in the host galaxy spectra affects the strength of the observed balmer absorption features .",
    "in fact , balmer absorption features can not be relied on because of ( 1 ) uncertainty in the ratio of narrow to broad emission in the scaled qso spectrum relative to that in the scattered light ( i.e. , the qso spectrum may miss some of the nlr , which will still be present in the scattered component ) , and ( 2 ) the frequent direct contamination from extended narrow - line emission .",
    "for this reason , we do not use their equivalent widths or their corresponding lick indices directly in our analysis .",
    "the balmer absorption lines , when available , do still enter as one component in our spectral fits . in some cases , the emission is clearly narrower than the absorption and can be masked out during the fitting procedure .",
    "for any objects for which there were concerns about the accuracy of the spectrophotometric calibration , we normalized the continuum of both the host galaxy spectrum and the models to unity to eliminate any dependance on the shape of the continuum . in all cases",
    ", these fits gave essentially the same starburst ages as the original fits that included the continuum shape .",
    "as an additional check , we have attempted to analyze the stellar populations , again using the ppxf routine of @xcite . in the mode we used , ppxf finds the best linear combination of spectral synthesis models to fit the observed spectrum over the rest - frame 35004500  .",
    "a 4th - order multiplicative polynomial is included in the fit to remove the low - order dependence on flux calibration and reddening .",
    "because this procedure introduces many more free parameters , it will work best for the spectra for which we have the highest s / n .",
    "this indeed seems to be the case : for the roughly half of the sample with the highest s / n and the least impact from extended emission , we find significant contributions from populations with ages within the range given in table 2 . for all but one of the remaining qso hosts , we find contributions from intermediate - age populations with ages slightly outside this range .",
    "for 2135@xmath1147 , this procedure finds only an old stellar population ; but this host galaxy is the one most strongly impacted by an extended emission region , so balmer absorption lines have no influence on the solution .",
    "we used models with metallicities ranging from 0.004 to @xmath21 to fit the host galaxy spectra .",
    "invariably , models with @xmath22 led to poor fits or did not converge . for most objects , the fits with the lowest @xmath19 values corresponded to those of models with solar metallicity .",
    "even in cases where models with metallicities somewhat lower or higher than solar gave reasonable fits , the ages of the best fitting populations changed only by @xmath23% . for consistency , we report results using solar metallicity models for all objects , except for 1217 + 023 , where a @xmath21 resulted in a significantly better fit .",
    "see section  [ oldpop ] for further discussion on metallicities .",
    "our results are summarized in figure  [ figure : bestfit ] and table  [ ages ] .",
    "figure  [ figure : bestfit ] shows each of the qso host spectra in the sample along with the best - fit model . as mentioned above",
    ", each model consists of a 10 gyr old population plus a younger ( typically of intermediate - age ) starburst .",
    "the models have been matched in resolution to the host - galaxy spectra , taking into account both the instrumental profile and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy . in table",
    "[ ages ] , we list the relative contribution at 4500   ( rest wavelength ) of the qso component that was subtracted from the observed host spectrum as described above , and the off - nuclear stellar velocity dispersion , @xmath24 . we also list the starburst ages and the percentage by mass that they contribute to the best - fit models",
    ". the age range given corresponds to the 68% confidence intervals in the fits for starburst ages , with their respective contributions listed as a contribution range .",
    "the first striking result is that the majority of the hosts have a substantial contribution from an intermediate - age starburst population .",

    "there is considerably more variation among the models in the values of the relative contribution of the starbursts .",
    "this is not surprising considering the large ranges of values that are given as confidence levels in table  [ ages ] .",
    "the large uncertainties in the relative contributions are explained as follows : while the total flux emitted per solar mass changes rapidly ( by more than a factor of two ) between a population of 1 and 2 gyr , the spectral features ( including the shape of the continuum ) change much more slowly and , therefore , @xmath19 changes relatively slowly . in other words ,",
    "a small increase in age for the starburst requires a larger increase in its relative contribution toward the total spectrum .",
    "this results in a broad range of values for the contribution that give similar values of @xmath19 ( see insets in fig .",
    "[ figure : bestfit ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , the qualitative presence of an intermediate - age population is quite secure because of the strength of the balmer absorption lines .",
    "we created an average qso host galaxy spectrum ( figure  [ figure : avghost ] ) by combining the spectra of all the host galaxies ( except for 1012 + 008 , for the reasons given above ) .",

    "thus , our results indicate that , far from being passively evolving elliptical galaxies , almost all of the qso host galaxies have suffered a major event of star formation within the past @xmath5 gyr .",
    "we have found that the majority ( 14/15 ) of the host galaxies in our sample are composed of large fractions of intermediate - age stellar populations .",

    "the right panel of figure  [ figure : oldpop ] shows that the stellar population would have to have a metallicity lower than 0.4 z@xmath26 in order to match the continuum of the host galaxy spectrum and , even then , the stellar features would not be a good fit to the data , as we discuss below . in any case , it is highly unlikely that galaxies in this mass range ( @xmath27 m@xmath28 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) would have such low metallicities .",
    "one might argue that the difference between the host galaxy spectra and a purely old population may be explained if the continuum of the host galaxy is affected by qso light , whether scattered by free electrons and dust , as @xcite suggest , or simply resulting from poor corrections of the qso light contamination on the host .",
    "it is clear from the shape of the residuals in figure  [ figure : oldpop ] that the difference in the continuum between an old population and our qso hosts can not be accounted for by qso light .    to further show that the qso host spectra differ from old population spectra by more than just the continuum , we subtracted different amounts of qso continuum from the average host to attempt to match the sed of the purely old populations discussed above .",
    "we subtracted a fit to an average qso spectrum without including the emission lines , since the latter would otherwise be obviously over - subtracted from the average host .",
    "we found that there is no way to reproduce the sed of either the elliptical galaxy or the single 10 gyr - old model of solar metalicity , regardless of the amount of qso continuum subtracted .",
    "we were able to reproduce roughly the sed from 4000 to 6000   of the 0.4 z@xmath26 10 gyr - old model by subtracting an additional 18% ( at 4500  ) of qso continuum ( with no emission lines ) .",
    "it is clear from figure  [ figure : continua ] that even if the artificially modified average spectrum can match a portion of the sed of a low - metallicity purely old population , the stellar features are better fit by a population that includes an intermediate - age population .",
    "thus , we conclude that the qso host galaxy spectra can not be fit by purely old stellar populations , regardless of metallicity or whether the spectra are contaminated by qso light .      as we mentioned in section  [ results ] , the combination of an old population with a very small fraction of a very young ( a few myr- to a few tens of myr - old ) population can mimic the sed of some ( 6/15 ) of the hosts in the spectral range that we cover in our observations .",
    "this is essentially the result that @xcite obtained .",
    "however , we have already shown that this particular combination of models is not a good fit to the absorption features in the spectrum .    adding any other population to a mostly old ( 10 gyr ) population results in much worse fits .",
    "we experimented with different possibilities , such as adding a very small amount of sustained star formation rate , or an old population with an exponentially decaying star formation rate with a long e - folding time .",
    "none of these options resulted in acceptable fits .",
    "can a moderately young ( 12 gyr ) population be impersonated by blue horizontal branch ( bhb ) stars in an old population ?",
    "figure [ maraston ] shows that such a scenario is at least roughly possible , in that a 10-gyr - old model with a blue horizontal branch can mimic a 1.5 gyr population fairly closely .",
    "one now has to ask whether it is astrophysically reasonable that luminous elliptical galaxies should have a sufficient population of bhb stars to produce the spectral variations that we have inferred to be signs of a 12-gyr - old starburst .",
    "the color of a star on the horizontal branch is determined to a large degree by its metallicity : the lower the metallicity , the bluer the star . by carefully modeling and subtracting off a maximum old , metal - poor component for a number of local ellipticals , @xcite show that , if a significant intermediate age population is actually present , correcting for the metal - poor population does not alter the age obtained for the intermediate - age population by very much .",
    "more importantly , the presence of the metal - poor population does not do away with the need for the intermediate - age population to explain the observed line strengths .    in our spectra",
    ", we do not have as good a calibration of line strengths as in studies of local ellipticals . on the other hand , for many of our host galaxies , the balmer lines are considerably stronger than in the local sample and the inferred intermediate - age population is much more significant than in the galaxies discussed by @xcite .",
    "plausible levels of bhb contamination are quite insignificant in comparison . for our few marginal cases , we can not completely exclude the possibility that bhb stars might reduce or eliminate the need for a younger component .",

    "as we mentioned in section  [ method ] , they fix a 0.1 gyr population to account for any recent star formation that may have occurred , and find the best fit by varying the age of the old underlying population . given their fitting method and the apparent degeneracy that we found at least for some objects in fitting the shape of the continuum , it is not hard to see how @xcite arrived at this conclusion , especially since their spectra are best constrained redward of the 4000   break .",

    "we have previously reported on the presence of striking tidal features and/or close interacting galaxies for six of the objects in our sample : 0157 + 001 @xcite , 1635 + 119 @xcite , 0054 + 144 , 0736 + 017 , 0923 + 201 , 2141 + 175 @xcite .",
    "the timescales implied by these various features are , in very rough terms , consistent with a picture where mergers were responsible for the starbursts that we observe . assuming a projected velocity of 300 km s@xmath7 on the plane of the sky for the stars that make up the tail , @xcite estimate a dynamical age for the prominent tidal tail in 0157 + 001 of 330 myr , compared to the stellar population of 0.8 ( + 0.2 , @xmath10.6 ) gyr that we find ( and already reported in @xcite ) .",

    "while this age estimate is of the same order as the starburst that we observe in 2141 + 175 ( 0.8 [ + 0.2 , @xmath10.2 ] gyr ) , it is younger than the starburst in 0054 + 144 ( 2.1[+0.6,@xmath10.8 ] gyr ) .",
    "thus , the starburst in the latter may have been triggered in a previous passage of the interacting galaxies , as in the case of 0157 + 001 .",
    "similarly , @xcite estimate a dynamical age of @xmath121 gyr for the tidal structure ( including ripples , tidal arms , and a faint long tidal tail ) surrounding the host of 0736 + 201 , which is of the order of , but younger , than the starburst age of @xmath122.2 ( + 0.2,@xmath10.6 ) gyr that we find in the host .",

    "while the host of 0923 + 201 does not show any obvious tidal features , it lies in a galaxy group of at least six members at similar redshifts ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , with several of the galaxies showing clear signs of interaction .",
    "there is one pair of interacting large elliptical galaxies at a projected distance of @xmath1237 kpc from the qso host , and a smaller galaxy with tail - like structures @xmath1256 kpc away .",
    "it is likely that these galaxies have interacted with the host galaxy within the past 1.4 gyrs , triggering the star formation in the host .",
    "we will present deep @xmath39 images of the remaining objects in the sample , together with similar images of a matched control sample , in a forthcoming paper . in summary , we find clear traces of merger and interaction events in almost two thirds of the qso hosts and hardly any such traces in the control sample .    a few of the spectroscopic surveys discussed in section  [ compare ] also examine the morphologies of the hosts . @xcite and @xcite find that @xmath1250% of the hosts in their samples show morphological signs of interactions and disturbed radial velocity curves .",
    "of the 29 post - starbursts quasars that have @xmath4 images ( presented by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , 17 ( @xmath1259% ) show signs of interactions or mergers .",
    "the early - type galaxies in the sample , which host the most luminous agn , have a similar fraction of objects with signs of interaction .",
    "although at first it would seem that the fractions of interacting objects in these samples are lower than in ours , we must keep in mind that our results are derived from high - resolution , very deep ( five orbits ) @xmath4 images that allow us to detect the aging tell - tale signs of mergers as they are fading away . if we were to analyze shallow and/or ground - based images of the six objects in our sample discussed above , we would find that only two ( 0157 + 001 and 2141 + 175 ) have obvious signs of tidal interactions and one ( 0923 + 201 ) has close interacting galaxies .",
    "thus , based on this subsample , we would conclude that only 50% of the hosts are connected to mergers .",
    "it is then possible that most , if not all , of the qso host galaxies that appear to be bulge dominated may indeed be more evolved merger remnants hosting intermediate age populations .",
    "thus , we find compelling evidence that the aging starbursts we observe in early - type qso hosts were triggered during the early stages of a merger event .",
    "typical qso lifetimes are expected to be , at most , @xmath40 years , so the currently observed qso activity can not have been triggered at the same time as these @xmath41-year - old starbursts .",
    "how , then , can we explain this correlation between qso activity and intermediate - age starbursts ?",
    "numerical simulations of merging galaxies show that the amplitude and duration of enhanced star forming activity , as well as the stage at which it occurs during a merger , depend on the specific parameters of the encounter ( orbits , mass ratios , etc . ) as well as the morphological type of the progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "it is clear , however , that many mergers result in two major epochs of star formation : one soon after first passage , and one during final coalescence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , numerical simulations show that accretion onto the central black hole(s ) is episodic , and there can be two ( or more ) major epochs of agn activity roughly corresponding to ( but somewhat delayed with respect to ; see @xcite ) the times at which star formation is dramatically enhanced ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "stickley and g. canalizo , in preparation ) .",
    "the time delay between the first and second epochs of enhanced star formation / agn activity naturally depends on the details of the merger ; typical values are of the order of 1 gyr , i.e. , of the same order as the ages of the starbursts that we observe in the qso hosts .",
    "thus , our observations appear to be consistent with the predictions made by numerical simulations . in this picture , the qso hosts in our sample are products of galaxy mergers .",
    "strong bursts of star formation are induced in the early stages of a galaxy interaction . as the galaxies continue to merge for the next billion or so years",
    ", the new stars mix with the older populations , and they age as the morphology of the newly formed galaxy begins to relax .",
    "when gas continues to concentrate in the central regions of the galaxy , a new central starburst is triggered , followed by a final epoch of agn activity .",
    "it is precisely at this moment that we seem to be observing the qsos in our sample .",
    "a glaring difference between this picture and our results is the absence of young stellar populations , expected to be the result of the major starburst triggered during the final coalescence of the galaxies , and a short time ( of the order of @xmath12100 myr ; @xcite ) before the triggering of the qso .",
    "however , these starbursts are expected to occur very close to the nucleus ( p. hopkins , s. van wassenhove , private communication ) , whereas our spectroscopic observations cover regions of the host galaxies that are typically @xmath128 kpc away from the center ( see table 1 ) .",
    "stars formed during earlier stages of mergers are more easily mixed with the rest of the population by the end of the merger because of the multiple passes that the interacting galaxies experience",
    ". however , once the galaxies merge , there is no further violent event to help mix the new stars .",
    "this is supported by numerical simulations that show that the velocity dispersions of stars formed in the late stages of mergers remain low compared to those of stars formed earlier on ( n.r .",
    "stickley and g.  canalizo , in preparation ) .",
    "at least for the one object for which we have spatially resolved spectra , 0157 + 001 @xcite , we do find significantly younger populations ( @xmath12200 myr old ) near the qso nucleus .",
    "there are a few other qso hosts for which spatially resolved information on stellar populations exists .",
    "@xcite show that the most luminous and youngest ( @xmath3610 myr ) stellar populations in the host galaxy of 3c48 are concentrated in the central regions of the host ( in the central @xmath125 kpc ) , while the outer regions are dominated by an older population .",
    "unfortunately , the s / n of the spectra in the outer regions is not sufficient to discriminate between a purely old population and a population including intermediate - age stars .",
    "similarly , the youngest starbursts ( @xmath3650 myr ) in the host of mrk231 are found in a region @xmath123 kpc from the qso nucleus @xcite , whereas the outer regions are dominated by older populations . as in the case of 3c48 , the s / n is insufficient to determine the precise composition of the older populations .",
    "finally , @xcite report on the presence of a @xmath4240 myr starburst in the central 600 pc of the host galaxy of the prototype post - starburst quasar , unj1025@xmath10040 , which is significantly younger than the dominant population of the host of 400 myr .",
    "however , there is evidence that the picture may be more complicated .",
    "@xcite found strong evidence that qsos selected by different criteria showed different levels of star formation .",
    "in particular , their sample of pg qsos ( generally radio quiet ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) showed significantly more star formation than did their sample of 3cr ( i.e. , radio - loud ) qsos .",
    "this result is amplified by @xcite , who found that , of a sample of 13 radio - loud qsos , only the compact - steep - spectrum quasar 3c48 showed any evidence of star formation . for the remaining 12 qsos ,",

    "these differences in typical star - formation rates between radio - quiet qsos and frii quasars most likely reflect differences in environments ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , but it is tempting to speculate that there may also be a dependance on merger stage . in any case , when @xcite say , `` we propose that type-1 quasars reside in a distinct galaxy population that shows elliptical morphology but that harbors a significant fraction of intermediate - age stars and is experiencing intense circumnuclear star formation , '' the last part of this statement appears not to hold generally for frii quasar hosts .",
    "we have concentrated on the qso sample of @xcite precisely because of their contention that the host galaxies of this sample have properties indistinguishable from those of local quiescent ellipticals .",
    "we find instead that virtually all of them have intermediate - age populations comprising a significant fraction of the total mass of the host galaxies .",
    "these populations can be interpreted in a natural way in terms of models of galaxy mergers , where the star formation is triggered by a previous passage of the galaxies , while the current qso activity results from the final merger .",
    "while there certainly are some cases of qsos seen in conjunction with contemporaneous starbursts , or at least with much younger populations @xcite , these seem to be relatively rare , and they probably depend on having serendipitous sightlines to the qso through otherwise dusty host galaxies . in most objects at similar stages , the qso nucleus is likely obscured , and the galaxies would be classified as ulirgs or hylirgs . by the time the starburst has subsided and the dust has cleared , the qso activity likely will have stopped , only to be re - triggered during the final merger .",
