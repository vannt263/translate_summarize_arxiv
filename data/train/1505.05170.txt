    "if no @xmath52 points of @xmath45 lie on a hyperplane then there exists @xmath50 with @xmath32 points such that the volumes of all the @xmath43-simplices defined by elements of @xmath51 are distinct .",

    "part ( 1 ) of this theorem improves the main result in @xcite , in which the bound @xmath53 was given for the case @xmath54 . part ( 2 ) , with @xmath54 , improves a bound given in @xcite that uses ramsey s theorem taking it down from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "furthermore , this version generalises to any number of dimensions .    as a second application",
    "we show a result regarding polynomials .",
    "[ coro : polynomial ] let @xmath57 be a field and @xmath58 $ ] be a symmetric polynomial of degree @xmath59 .",
    "there exists a constant @xmath44 depending only on @xmath43 such that if @xmath60 and @xmath61 then we can choose a subset @xmath50 of size @xmath32 such that all the evaluations of @xmath62 in @xmath63 distinct elements of @xmath51 are distinct .",
    "if the polynomial @xmath62 has degree @xmath64 then @xmath62 is simply the sum of @xmath63 variables .",
    "an analogous theorem for sums of @xmath3 distinct elements in abelian groups also holds and has a similar proof , although this was already a consequence of the theorem in @xcite .",
    "finally we consider @xmath65-sequences , also called sidon sequences ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these are increasing sequences ( possibly finite ) of positive integers @xmath66 such that the sums @xmath67 are distinct for every @xmath68 .",
    "an equivalent definition is that the differences @xmath69 are distinct for every @xmath68 .",
    "[ coro : sidon ] there is a constant @xmath70 such that any set @xmath45 of positive integers with @xmath71 contains a @xmath65-sequence of length @xmath32 .    for comparison",
    ", it is known that for every @xmath72 there is a large enough @xmath32 such that the set @xmath73 contains a @xmath65-sequence of length @xmath32 .",
    "as stated before , the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] is very similar to the proof theorem 3 in @xcite and only needs minor adjustments .",
    "therefore , we only include a sketch of the main idea .",
    "the proof uses a theorem by ajtai et al .",
    "@xcite that gives a lower bound on the independence number of an _ uncrowded _ hypergraph .",
    "an uncrowded hypergraph is one which has no cycles of length @xmath63 , @xmath74 or @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath76 be a colouring with no monochromatic @xmath0-sunflowers with more than @xmath1 petals .",
    "we wish to find a large rainbow subset of @xmath4 . for convenience , denote @xmath77 .",
    "we construct a @xmath78-hypergraph @xmath79 as follows : the vertices are @xmath4 and @xmath80 is an edge if and only if it contains two different sets @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "then an independent set on @xmath79 corresponds to a rainbow set of @xmath7 .",
    "there is a simple probabilistic argument to get rid of all the edges of @xmath79 while keeping a good portion of the vertices , but this method yields the desired bound without the @xmath83 factor .",
    "we chose to illustrate it here , as the proof of the tighter bound involves applying the same method to instead get rid of all 2,3,4-cycles of @xmath79 first while keeping a larger amount of vertices , and then using the lower bound on the independence number of an uncrowded hypergraph by ajtai et al .",
    "the sunflower condition implies that the number of edges of @xmath79 can be bounded as follows : @xmath84 but these edges have size @xmath78 , which is larger than @xmath85 , since @xmath86 .",
    "we use the probabilistic method : choose @xmath87 and then choose each vertex independently at random with probability @xmath62 ( erase with probability @xmath88 ) .",
    "since @xmath89 , if we choose @xmath62 adequately we can `` destroy '' all but a few edges .",
    "let @xmath90 denote the random variables which count the number of vertices and edges respectively .",
    "by linearity of the expected value @xmath91 , we have : @xmath92    after this process we would like to obtain a hypergraph in which the number of edges is in @xmath93 , so we can delete the remaining edges `` by hand '' ( by , say , deleting one vertex from each ) .",
    "this can be assured if the expected value of @xmath94 is in @xmath93 .",
    "equality between @xmath95 and @xmath96 is achieved when @xmath97 , so that @xmath98 . choosing a slightly smaller @xmath62 achieves the desired result . with some technical details",
    "omitted , we can get an independent set of @xmath79 of size in @xmath99 , which is a rainbow of the original .",
    "the gritty details for the improved bound can be found in @xcite , and their proof works almost word for word for this generalisation , the only difference being that some expressions have to be multiplied by the constant @xmath1 , which does not affect the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "now we prove the generalisation of theorem [ thm : main ] to infinite hypergraphs .",
    "this theorem is implied by a theorem of erds and rado @xcite .",
    "[ thm : er ] let @xmath100 be any colouring of the @xmath3-sets of @xmath101 .",
    "then there exists an infinite subset @xmath102 and a set of indices @xmath103 with @xmath104 such that two ordered subsets @xmath105 have the same colour if and only if @xmath106 for every @xmath107 $ ] .",
    "for example , when @xmath108 , we have a monochromatic structure because the colour of a @xmath3-set does not depend on any of the elements , and when @xmath109 $ ] we have a rainbow structure because the colour of a @xmath3-set depends on every element .",
    "now we are ready to prove theorem [ thm : infinite ] .    without loss of generality",
    "we may assume @xmath110 .",
    "suppose @xmath111 has the property that any monochromatic @xmath112-sunflower has at most @xmath1 petals .",
    "let @xmath113 and @xmath114 $ ] be sets as in theorem [ thm : er ] , we wish to prove that @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "for sake of contradiction , assume that some number @xmath115 $ ] is not in @xmath116 .",
    "fix numbers @xmath117 in @xmath45 such that there are distinct @xmath118 strictly between @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "then the @xmath3-sets @xmath121 for @xmath122 form a monochromatic @xmath123sunflower with @xmath124 petals .",
    "theorem [ thm : infinite ] makes it clear that the corollaries above have corresponding infinite versions .",
    "in this section we will only use the case @xmath110 of theorem [ thm : main ] , so the condition on the size of @xmath4 becomes @xmath125 the proofs are straightforward , all that needs to be done is define a colouring of the @xmath3-tuples of a set and show that the monochromatic sunflower condition is satisfied for some @xmath1 . then theorem [ thm : main ] gives us the desired subset .        in part",
    "( 2 ) , we colour a @xmath127-tuple by its volume .",
    "given @xmath43 points , the set of points that complete this @xmath43-tuple into a simplex of a prescribed volume is the union of two hyperplanes , since there are at most @xmath43 points on each , we set @xmath129 .    for the last part , we colour a @xmath127-tuple by its similarity type . fix @xmath130 and let @xmath131 and @xmath132 be sets of @xmath52 points that determine a certain similarity type but with different orientations . if @xmath133 makes @xmath134 have the same similarity type as @xmath131 , then it determines a unique injective function @xmath135 or a unique injective function @xmath136 . since there are @xmath137 of these functions , we may take @xmath138 .    since @xmath62 is symmetric we can colour a pair of distinct elements @xmath139 by the value of @xmath140 .",
    "now write @xmath141 .",
    "let @xmath142 be the smallest index for which @xmath143 , @xmath144 be the zero - set of @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",

    "for every fixed @xmath147 , @xmath148 is a polynomial on @xmath149 with degree between @xmath64 and @xmath43 , therefore the equation @xmath150 has at most @xmath43 solutions .",
