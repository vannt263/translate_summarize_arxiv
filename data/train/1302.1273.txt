    "<S> we consider a single josephson junction in the presence of time varying gate charge , and examine the nonequilibrium work done by the charge control in the framework of fluctuation theorems . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the probability distribution functions of the works performed by forward protocol and by its time reversed protocol , which from the crooks relation gives the estimation of the free energy changes @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the reliability of @xmath1 estimated from the jarzynksi equality is crucially dependent on protocol parameters , while bennett s acceptance ratio method confirms consistently @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the error of the jarzynski estimator either grows or becomes saturated as the duration of the work protocol increases , which depends on the protocol rapidity determining the existence of the oscillatory motion of the phase difference across the junction . </S>",
    "<S> the average of the work also shows similar behaviors and its saturation value is given by the relative weight of the oscillatory trajectory with respect to running trajectories with constant acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss non - negativity of the work average and its relation to heat and entropy production associated with the circuit control . </S>"
