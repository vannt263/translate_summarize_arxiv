    "@xmath12 is from the majorana mass term @xmath13 .    with three generations of left- and right - handed neutrinos , @xmath12 is a @xmath14 symmetric matrices , and @xmath15 is a @xmath14 arbitrary matrix .",
    "the elements in @xmath15 can be of the same order of the magnitude as the corresponding charge leptons , and the scale of @xmath12 is a new scale characterizing possible new physics beyond sm which is expected to be much larger than the weak scale .",
    "to the leading order , the mass matrices @xmath16 and @xmath17 for the heavy and light neutrinos are given by    @xmath18    the light neutrino masses are suppressed compared with their charged lepton partners by a factor of @xmath19 resulting in very small neutrino masses compared with the masses of their corresponding charged leptons .",
    "the eigen - values and eigen - vectors of @xmath17 are the light neutrino masses and mixing measured by low energy experiments .",
    "the mixing matrix is the unitary matrix @xmath20 ( the pmns matrix@xcite ) which diagonalizes the mass matrix , and is defined , in the basis where the charged lepton is already diagonalized , by @xmath21 with the eigenvalues @xmath22 to be larger or equal to zero .",
    "one can always decompose @xmath20 into a product of a ckm matrix@xcite like unitary matrix @xmath23 and a phase matrix @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "the phase @xmath26 is the majorana phase .",

    "@xmath12 not only provides a scale for new physics responsible for the mechanism to explain the smallness of neutrino masses , but also affects the low energy mixing , and vice versa .",
    "it may also provide important ingredients to explain the baryon asymmetry of our universe ( bau ) through lepton number violating decays of the heavy neutrino to light neutrinos and higgs particles by the yukawa coupling @xmath33 , the leptogenesis mechanism@xcite .",

    "the present neutrino oscillation experimental data on neutrino masses and mixing angles from@xcite solar , atmospheric , reactor neutrino oscillation experiments can be summarized as the following .",
    "the @xmath34 allowed ranges for the mass - squared differences are constrained to be@xcite : @xmath35 ev@xmath36 @xmath37 ev@xmath36 , and @xmath38 ev@xmath36 @xmath39 ev@xmath36 , with the best fit values given by @xmath40 ev@xmath36 , and @xmath41 ev@xmath36 .",

    "several experiments are planned to measure @xmath51 with greater precisions@xcite .",
    "obviously should a non - zero value for @xmath51 be measured , modifications for the model considered are needed .",
    "the bi - large mixing model can be taken as the lowest order approximation .",
    "the bi - large mixing model captures many features of the present data and deserves more careful theoretical studies .",
    "the bi - large mixing mass matrix is of the form@xcite    @xmath52    the above mass matrix produces bi - large mixing matrix , but the neutrino masses can not be completely fixed using the two mass different @xmath53 and @xmath54 measurements even one knows all information about the mixing matrix .",
    "additional inputs are needed to further constrain or to determine the parameters in the neutrino mass matrix@xcite .",
    "several proposals have been made to reduce the parameters , such as texture zero@xcite , determinant zero requirement@xcite , and traceless requirement@xcite for the mass matrix . in this paper",
    "we impose texture zeros on bi - large mixing mass matrix to constrain neutrino masses and majorana phases and also study the implications for leptogenesis .",
    "to study leptogenesis , one needs further information on the heavy neutrino mass matrix .",

    ", there is no ckm like cp violating phase in the charged current interaction with @xmath60 boson .",
    "the majorana phases can , however , play a non - trivial role in leptogenesis@xcite and will be studied in more details later .",
    "the heavy neutrino mass matrix can be expressed as    @xmath61    we note that none of the neutrino masses can be zero .",
    "we comment that when discussing see - saw neutrino mass matrices , there are two scales , the light neutrino and the heavy neutrino mass scales .",
    "the mass matrices at the two scales may be different due to renormalization group running effects@xcite .",
    "a mass matrix element is zero at a particular scale may not be zero at another scale unless there are certain symmetries to guarantee this@xcite .",
    "an important problem in neutrino physics is to understand the origin of neutrino masses and mixing .",
    "there are many attempts have been made to understand this problem , at present the answer is , however , far from satisfaction .",
    "we will not attempt to carry out a model building investigation of the mass matrices , instead we will study phenomenological implications here .",
    "however , we would like to point out there are models which can produce some models we study .",
    "for example , in ref@xcite it was shown that for three generations of left - handed leptons and three generations of right - handed charged leptons and neutrinos , it is possible to obtain @xmath62 and @xmath12 of the form in eq.([mr ] ) with @xmath63 if there are 3 higgs doublets and 2 neutral signets which transform , non - trivially , under a discrete group @xmath64 . in this model",
    "the flavor symmetries of the model dictates that the light neutrino mass matrix structure is essentially determined by the heavy neutrino mass matrix@xcite .",
    "we will generalize the discussion to include all possible texture zeros in both the light and heavy bi - large mass matrices .",
    "although the classes of models have simple structures , there are very rich phenomenological implications on the neutrino masses , cp violating phases and on leptogenesis .",
    "there are two different ways the texture zeros can be imposed : a ) the texture zeros are imposed on the light neutrino mass matrix @xmath17 ; and b ) the texture zeros are imposed on the heavy neutrino mass matrix @xmath12 .",
    "there are five different cases for each of class a ) and class b ) types of models which give non - trivial three generation mixing .    for class a )",
    "the five cases indicated by @xmath65 are @xmath66    for class b ) the five cases have the same forms as above .",
    "we denote them and their matrix elements by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .    before discussing the above mass matrices in detail , we make some comments on the neutrino masses",
    ". there are three light neutrino masses , and there are two observable mass differences @xmath69 and @xmath54 from neutrino oscillation . if one of the neutrino masses , or a combination of them , is known , the rest of the masses can be determined in terms of @xmath70 .",
    "we express @xmath71 and @xmath72 as a function of @xmath73 as , @xmath74    there are additional constraints on the neutrino masses .",
    "one of them comes from wmap data which limits @xmath75 to be less than@xcite @xmath76 ev at the 95% c.l .. in the future cosmological data can improve the sensitivity and reach 0.03 ev@xcite .",
    "there are another two constraints , the effective mass for neutrinoless double beta decays , @xmath77 .",
    "the current experimental upper bounds for @xmath78 and @xmath79 are 1.35 ev@xcite and 3 ev@xcite , respectively .",
    "these bounds are less stringent than the wmap constraint . however , in the future , the sensitivities for @xmath78 and @xmath80 can reach 0.01 ev @xcite and 0.12 ev@xcite , respectvely , by laboratory experiments .",
    "these experiments can provide interesting constraints .",
    "if there are additional constraints , such as texture zeros , it may be possible to determine the neutrino masses or relate the masses to the cp violating majorana phases which are otherwise very difficult to measure .",

    ", we obtain the central value of @xmath73 for the normal hierarchy to be 0.0038 ev and the 3@xmath89 lower bound to be 0.0025 ev . the sum of the masses @xmath90 is equal to 0.062 @xmath91 0.010 ev which satisfies the wmap bound and can be probed by future cosmological data .",
