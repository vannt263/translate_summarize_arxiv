    "amplitudes are analytic functions of @xmath8 , so @xmath9 is accompanied by a real part given by the dispersion integral @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the principal value integral and @xmath12 is the value of @xmath8 at threshold .",

    "the @xmath83 threshold is at 1390 mev and the @xmath83 phase space increases rapidly with mass .",
    "when one allows for @xmath83 phase space , the 1475 mev peak may be fitted with a resonance at 1440 mev .",
    "the @xmath79 ( or @xmath88 if one takes crystal barrel data @xcite ) , appears in @xmath89 .",

    "a breit - wigner resonance of constant width is a first approximation .",
    "the @xmath98 was originally fitted as a breit - wigner of constant width , but in more detail its parametrisation ( and particularly its elasticity ) is sensitive to the opening of the @xmath99 and @xmath100 thresholds @xcite .",
    "a similar analysis of @xmath101 is in progress .",
    "the exotic @xmath102 has been convincingly confirmed at meson08 by new compass data on the @xmath103 channel . at lower mass",
    ", there are claims for an additional @xmath104 .",
    "an analysis of these data including the opening of the @xmath105 and @xmath106 thresholds is needed to distinguish between a resonance and threshold cusps .",
    "jaffe @xcite proposes to interpret these states as a nonet due to su(3 ) @xmath109 states made up of @xmath110 and @xmath111 pairs .",
    "there is evidence for diquark interactions experimentally and in lattice gauge calculations so there is probably some element of such pairs in the wave function .",
    "however , there are disagreements with observed decay branching ratios @xcite .",
    "the ratio @xmath112/\\gamma [ a_0(980 ) \\to kk]$ ] is predicted to be 0.93 , but is experimentally @xmath113 and the ratio @xmath114/\\gamma [ f_0(980 ) \\to \\pi",
    "\\pi]$ ] is also at least a factor 3 less than predicted .",
    "the obvious explanation is a substantial @xmath19 component in the wave function .",
    "more serious is that the ratio @xmath115/ \\gamma [ \\sigma \\to \\pi \\pi ] $ ] is at least 6 standard deviations higher than predicted .",
    "the broad @xmath108 is only just resonant and falls apart easily .",
    "there are at least three reasons to believe that this nonet is driven largely by meson exchanges .",
    "firstly , caprini et al .",
    "@xcite successfully predict @xmath73 phase shifts and the @xmath107 pole from the roy equations ; these equations include crossed channels exactly and therefore depend entirely on meson exchanges except for subtractions for scattering lengths .",
    "secondly , janssen et al . successfully predicted @xmath18 and @xmath45 on the basis of meson exchanges @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the model of rupp and van beveren successfully accounts for the entire nonet with a single coupling constant and su(3 ) coefficients @xcite .",
    "it finds all four states arise from the continuum , i.e. from non - confined states .",
    "an interesting detail of the model is that the movement of the poles can easily be traced as a function of the coupling constant .",
    "the @xmath45 is _ not _ attracted to the @xmath91 threshold because of the adler zero nearby ; this adler zero is built into the model .",
    "instead it settles close to the @xmath19 threshold , because the adler zero in this channel is distant , at @xmath116 .",
    "i shall adopt the view that this nonet is largely driven by meson exchanges .",
    "we know that meson exchanges also account for features of @xmath0- and @xmath1- channel peaks fitted to regge exchanges throughout the intermediate ( few gev ) mass range .",
    "my conclusion is therefore that meson exchanges combine with short - range gluonic attraction to form all or most of the resonances other than the @xmath107 nonet .",
    "the evidence that thresholds attract resonances is consistent with this picture .",
    "oset , oller and collaborators have found @xcite they can predict a number of states purely from meson exchanges as ` dynamically driven ' resonances , e.g. @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "likewise , hamilton and donnachie found in 1965 @xcite that meson and baryon exchanges have the right signs to help generate @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 baryons .",
    "let us carry this argument a step further .",
    "suppose contributions to the hamiltonian are @xmath123 from confined gluons and @xmath124 from meson and baryon exchanges .",
    "it is almost inevitable that there will be mixing between these two sources , and there is experimental evidence for such mixing for @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "then the eigenvalue equation is @xmath125 where @xmath126 describes mixing .",
    "the variational principle ensures the minimum value of @xmath127 is the eigenstate .",
    "the stronger of @xmath123 and @xmath124 gets pulled down . for @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath45 and @xmath18 ,",
    "long - range forces operate through mesonic s - waves and are stronger at low masses than confinement , which leads to @xmath128 @xmath11-states near the mass of @xmath47 .",
    "otherwise , most non-@xmath129 and non-@xmath130 states are pushed up and become too broad to observe .",
    "there is a close analogy with molecular physics and the formation of the covalent bond in chemistry .",
    "there is a cooperative effect between confinement and @xmath8- and @xmath0-channel exchanges in forming the ground - state .",
    "valcarce , vijande and barnea have made an interesting study of mixing between diquark and tetraquark configurations @xcite , though they do not specifically take the cusp effect into account .",
    "they find that tetraquark configurations all lie higher than diquark configurations if they ignore attraction between diquark pairs .",
    "there must be some short - range repulsion between like quarks due to the pauli principle , as in the short - range repulsion in nucleon - nucleon physics .",
    "this repulsion plays a crucial role in preventing nuclear matter from collapsing ( and maybe for mesons and baryons too ) .",
    "i wish to thank prof .",
    "g. rupp and prof .",
    "e. van beveren for extensive discussions .",
    "use of their model led to important insight into the way poles move near a threshold .",
