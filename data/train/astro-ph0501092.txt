    "one of eddington s famous discoveries is that the isotropic distribution function ( df ) of a spherical stellar system can be calculated from the density using an abel transform pair @xcite : @xmath6 here , @xmath7 is the binding energy per unit mass , and @xmath8 is the relative potential .    however , galaxy halos produced in cosmological simulations are held up by anisotropic velocity dispersions ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "however , for most cases this procedure is analytically intractable .",

    "one such possible ( @xmath50,@xmath8)-split with an analytically tractable inversion is given by @xmath51 we note that a df of the form of equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) can be inverted from an ( @xmath50,@xmath8)-split that is a monomial of @xmath50 , with its power index linearly related to @xmath17 . by having the ( @xmath50,@xmath8)-split given by a linear combination of two monomials of @xmath50 , the inversion of equation ( [ eq : expone ] )",
    "can be achieved by simply extending the known procedure , while the system is no longer restricted to have uniform velocity anisotropy .",
    "inspired by this , let us suppose that the df is of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are functions of @xmath9 to be determined .",

    ". figure  [ fig : anisoc ] shows the behavior of @xmath17 for some of these models .",
    "the curves can be understood on examination of equation ( [ eq : gicvi ] ) .",
    "this reveals that whereas @xmath73 at @xmath74 for any @xmath61 , @xmath75 if @xmath76 , or @xmath77 if @xmath78 . at the critical value @xmath39 , we find that the anisotropy parameter monotonically decreases from @xmath79 at @xmath74 to @xmath80 as @xmath38 .",
    "hence , the dfs discussed in this section build the generalized isochrone spheres with either decreasing @xmath17 in the inner region and increasing @xmath17 in the outer region ( @xmath78 ) , or decreasing @xmath17 throughout ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "the particular case of the latter also includes the hernquist model ( @xmath39 ) and the classical isochrone sphere ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "the simplest case is again @xmath42 , which leads to @xmath82 then we find that the virial theorem holds locally for this case : @xmath83 and the anisotropy parameter @xmath84 varies from @xmath85 at @xmath74 , to @xmath86 at @xmath87 , and back to @xmath88 as @xmath38 .",
    "this model in fact corresponds to one of the generalized hypervirial models studied by @xcite .",

    "we note that both @xmath92 and @xmath93 in fact reduce to the incomplete beta functions , which may be useful for the purpose of numerical calculations . furthermore , if @xmath94 is an integer , both @xmath92 and @xmath93 reduce to elementary functions of @xmath8 , and so do the velocity second moments .",
    "in particular , if @xmath39 [ for which @xmath95 , @xmath96 @xmath97",
    "next , let us consider the one - parameter family of potential - density pairs , @xmath98 which was originally introduced by @xcite .",

    "@xcite recently found that this family can be constructed from power - law dfs of the form of @xmath99 .",
    "here we construct slightly more complicated dfs that build this family of models .",
    "we first find every df of the form of equation ( [ eq : ansatz ] ) , and then use them to build models with a more general variation of anisotropy .      with @xmath100 , we find that @xmath101 and that @xmath102 for @xmath103",
    ". then , equation ( [ eq : disint ] ) reduces to @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the integer floor of @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "if @xmath108 , it is at least formally possible to derive the series expression of the df for arbitrary @xmath61 and @xmath17 from the integral form , namely , @xmath109 which becomes the generalized hypergeometric series if @xmath61 is a rational number . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath110 , we find that @xmath111 so that the corresponding df is unphysical . hence , for the potential - density pair of equation ( [ eq : pdpair ] ) , the constant anisotropy df is physical only if @xmath112 .",
    "this means that the hypervirial models of @xcite , which have an anisotropy parameter @xmath73 , have the maximally radially biased velocity dispersions for a given @xmath61 and a constant @xmath17 .",
    "although there exist models with @xmath17 locally exceeding @xmath113 for the generalized plummer sphere of given @xmath61 ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , @xmath17 at the center can not be greater than @xmath113 for physically valid dfs .",
    "this is in agreement with the cusp slope ",
    "central anisotropy theorem derived by @xcite .",
    "the corresponding velocity dispersions can be found either from equation ( [ eq : vint ] ) or by solving jeans equation .",
    "the results can be generally expressed using the incomplete beta functions .",
    "the equivalent results expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions are also found in equation ( 9 ) of @xcite .    for particular values of @xmath61 or @xmath17 ,",
    "the df of equation ( [ eq : gpdf ] ) ( or equivalently , eq .  [ eq : gpdfs ] ) reduces to a simpler form .",

    "* ) @xmath120 which is nonnegative everywhere if @xmath121 , whereas that for the constant-@xmath17 plummer model reduces to @xmath122 which is physical if @xmath123 .",
    "since equation ( [ eq : gpd ] ) is valid for any constant @xmath17 with common @xmath124 , it is , in general , also possible to express the density profile of the generalized plummer model by @xmath125 where the parameters @xmath126 are normalized weights .",
    "consequently , the superposition of the constant anisotropy dfs , @xmath127 , still builds the generalized plummer sphere . here",
    "each @xmath128 is given by equation ( [ eq : gpdf ] ) ( or equivalently , eq .  [ eq : gpdfs ] ) in which @xmath17 is replaced by @xmath129 .",
    "the velocity second moments for these models are found to be @xmath130 where @xmath131 and therefore the anisotropy parameter @xmath17 is no longer constant .    for the particular case in which the sum only contains two terms ( such that @xmath132 , @xmath133 , and @xmath134 for all other @xmath135 values )",

    "the behavior of the anisotropy parameter @xmath17 for the model given by dfs of equation ( [ eq : sdf ] ) is shown in figure  [ fig : aniso ] .",
    "again we note that equation ( [ eq : hypg ] ) in general reduces to the incomplete beta function while , for this case , it further reduces to an expression involving only elementary functions of @xmath8 if @xmath147 is an integer , and so and so do @xmath17 and the velocity second moments .",
    "as an application of the preceding theory , let us consider the problem of estimating the mass of the milky way from the radial velocities of its satellites",
    ". there are 27 distant globular clusters and dwarf galaxies at galactocentric distance @xmath50 greater than 20 kpc ( see e.g. , tables 2 and 3 of * ? ? ?",
    "these range from arp  2 at @xmath148 out to leo  i at @xmath149 .",
    "the median distance of the satellite population is @xmath150 .",
    "the number density of the satellites falls off roughly like @xmath151 .",
    "this dataset is often used to estimate the mass of the milky way @xcite , as the h1 rotation curve can not be traced beyond @xmath520 kpc .",
    "the satellites are therefore the only available probe of the gravitational field of the distant halo .",
    "all the satellites have accurate radial velocities , but proper motions are available only for a handful of the closest objects . of course , the heliocentric radial velocity and the galactocentric radial velocity are basically the same ( once the motion of the sun has been taken out ) , as the galactocentric distance of the sun is much smaller than those of the satellites .",
    "the kinematic data therefore constrains the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction @xmath152 . again using the data in tables 2 and 3 of @xcite",
    ", we find that @xmath153 .    to model the milky way halo",
    ", we assume that its potential and density take the form of either the generalized isochrone or the generalized plummer models .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the number density of satellites shadows the total density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the satellites are drawn from dfs of the form given by either equation ( [ eq : diffiso ] ) or equation ( [ eq : sdf ] ) .",
    "we set the scale length so that the half - mass radius of the assumed density profile corresponds to the observed median radius of the population .",
    "the mass of the milky way @xmath24 enters into the potential and the df .",
    "it can therefore be constrained by requiring that the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction be consistent with the data , viz , @xmath154 the parameter @xmath61 in the dfs controls the variation of the velocity anisotropy with radius .",
    "hence , equation ( [ eq : crux ] ) defines a line in the plane @xmath155 , which is the _ mass - anisotropy degeneracy curve _ for the model .",
    "figure  [ fig : massaniso ] , inferred from numerical integrations , shows such curves computed for a number of the generalized isochrones and the generalized plummer models .    in this problem ,",
    "the mean kinetic energy in the radial direction is fixed .",
    "models with tangential anisotropy at large radii therefore lead to a higher inferred mass for the milky way galaxy .",
    "the relative location of the curves in figure  [ fig : massaniso ] can be understood by examining the behavior of the anisotropy parameter for the models .",
    "more importantly , as the velocity anisotropy changes , the inferred mass of the milky way ranges from @xmath156 to @xmath157 .",
    "now , the velocity anisotropy of the satellite galaxy population is unknown , so the mass - anisotropy degeneracy _ by itself _ enforces a factor of @xmath53 uncertainty in the mass of the milky way .",
    "this fundamental limitation can only be overcome by proper - motion data .",
    "of course , there are other uncertainties ; for example , the half - mass radius of the satellite population used to set the scale length in these calculations is also not well known ( note that the locations of the satellites are likely to be biased toward their apogalacticon ) and has an uncertainty of @xmath520% .",
    "this carries over into an additional @xmath520% uncertainty in the inferred mass .",
    "this is small in comparison with the mass - anisotropy degeneracy , but not insignificantly so .",
    "this paper provides a number of flexible and simple galaxy models extended from two classical cored profiles : the isochrone sphere and plummer model .",
    "we also derive analytic distribution functions ( dfs ) with varying velocity anisotropy for all the models including new dfs for the classical isochrone sphere and the hernquist model .",
    "dfs of the form @xmath158 build a spherical system with a constant anisotropy parameter @xmath17 , where @xmath9 is the binding energy and @xmath159 is the specific angular momentum . the assumption of constant anisotropy is not enough to provide realistic models , as both observational data and numerical simulations suggest that dark halos and their constituents ( such as satellites ) have velocity anisotropies that vary with radius ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "here we have explored models whose dfs are superpositions of two or more such terms , namely , @xmath160 this can be done in two ways .",
    "first , as illustrated by the generalized isochrones in   [ sec : gis ] , we can sometimes find a splitting of the density in the form @xmath161 and apply the inversion separately to each component .",
    "for the generalized isochrones , this provides models with either decreasing anisotropy parameter @xmath17 in the inner region and increasing @xmath17 in the outer parts , or decreasing @xmath17 throughout .",
    "second , as illustrated by the generalized plummer models in ",
    "[ sec : gp ] , we can always add together weighted sums of constant anisotropy dfs , each of which individually reproduces the required density .",
    "this appears to provide models with decreasing anisotropy parameter @xmath17 throughout . at large radii ,",
    "the df is dominated by the component of smallest @xmath17 , and the models can be either radially or tangentially anisotropic in the outer parts , according to choice .",
    "for both cases , it appears that the anisotropy parameter always decreases on beginning to move outward from the very center .",
    "there have been a number of previous algorithms suggested for building anisotropic dfs with varying anisotropy .",
    "for example , the osipkov - merritt algorithm @xcite builds models that are isotropic in the inner parts and tend to extreme radial anisotropy ( @xmath162 ) in the outer parts .",
    "@xcite provided a clever algorithm for building separable dfs of the form @xmath163 where @xmath164 is the angular momentum of a circular orbit with energy @xmath9 .",
    "the analytic examples provided by @xcite all have increasing radial anisotropy in the outer parts .",
    "his method can be used to generate tangentially anisotropic models , but usually at the cost of a numerical inversion .",
    "the methods developed in this paper therefore provide a complement to the existing inversions .",
    "tangential anisotropy often arises in accreted populations , such as satellite galaxies . as an application of our models",
    ", we have shown that the mass - anisotropy degeneracy by itself provides a factor @xmath53 uncertainty in the mass of the milky way galaxy as deduced from the kinematics of its satellites .",
    "the density profiles of models studied in this paper typically fall off faster than @xmath165 and slower than @xmath166 at large radii , which are in good agreement with both observations of spheroidal components of galaxies and results from numerical simulations . at small radii",
    ", they are typically cusped , with cusp indices in the range suggested by numerical simulations . in particular",
    ", there are members with density cusps like @xmath167 , @xmath168 , and @xmath169 , which have been suggested as important on cosmogonic grounds @xcite , although observational evidence seems to favor the presence of a constant - density core @xcite",
    ". however , even if real galaxies are cored , the core would be such a small fraction of the halo that it is not practically important for studies of the whole .",
    "our families of new models therefore should find widespread application in the modeling of galaxies and dark halos .",
    "we thank c. hunter , who made a number of interesting comments on the various incarnations of this paper .",
