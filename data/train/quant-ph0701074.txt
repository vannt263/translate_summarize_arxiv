    "in the study of most quantum information tasks such as teleportation and quantum cryptography , non - relativistic observers share entangled resources to perform their experiments @xcite . apart from a few studies",
    "@xcite , most works on quantum information assume a world without gravity where spacetime is flat .",
    "but the world is relativistic and any serious theoretical study must take this into account .",
    "it is therefore of fundamental interest to revise quantum information protocols in relativistic settings @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that relativistic effects on quantum resources are not only quantitatively important but also induce novel , qualitative features @xcite .",
    "for example , it has been shown that the dynamics of spacetime can generate entanglement @xcite .",
    "this , in principle , would have a consequence in any entanglement - based protocol performed in curved spacetime .",
    "relativistic effects have also been found to be relevant in a flat spacetime , where the entanglement described by observers in uniform acceleration is observer - dependent since it is degraded by the unruh effect @xcite . in the infinite acceleration limit",
    ", the entanglement vanishes for bosons @xcite and reaches a non - vanishing minimum for fermions @xcite .",
    "this degradation on entanglement results in the loss of fidelity of teleportation protocols which involve observers in uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "understanding entanglement in a relativistic framework is not only of interest to quantum information .",
    "entanglement plays an important role in black hole entropy @xcite and in the apparent loss of information in black holes @xcite , one of the most challenging problems in theoretical physics at the moment @xcite .",
    "understanding the entanglement between modes of a field close to the horizon of a black hole might help to understand some of the key questions in black hole thermodynamics and their relation to information .    in this paper",
    "we interpret the loss of bipartite entanglement between two modes of a scalar field from a non - inertial perspective , as an effect of entanglement redistribution .",
    "precisely , we consider the entanglement between two field modes , each described from the perspective of a different observer .",
    "suppose that the two modes are entangled to a given degree from the perspective of two inertial observers .",
    "the state will appear less entangled if either one or both the observers move with uniform acceleration @xcite .",
    "this is because each mode described by an inertial observer corresponds to two entangled modes from the perspective of a non - inertial observer @xcite .",
    "consequently , a two - mode entangled state described from the inertial perspective , corresponds to a three - mode state when described from the perspective of one inertial observer and one in uniform acceleration , and to a four - mode state if both observers are accelerated .",
    "physical observers moving with uniform acceleration have access only to one of the non - inertial modes .",
    "thus , when describing the state ( which involves tracing over the unaccessible modes ) the observers find that some of the correlations are lost .",
    "this phenomenon , stemming from the unruh effect @xcite , was first studied from the quantum information perspective for bosonic scalar fields @xcite ( considering one inertial observer and the other one undergoing uniform acceleration ) and later for fermionic dirac fields @xcite .",
    "although entanglement of particle number states is in both cases degraded as a function of the acceleration , there are important differences in the results .",
    "for example , in the infinite acceleration limit , the entanglement reaches a non - vanishing minimum value for fermions , while it completely disappears in the bosonic case . for photon helicity entangled states , instead , the correlations are not degraded at all @xcite .",
    "the loss of entanglement was explained in the fermionic case in the light of the entanglement sharing framework as an effect of the redistribution of entanglement among all , accessible and unaccessible , modes .",
    "although the loss of entanglement was first studied for scalar fields ( considering a state from an inertial perspective which is maximally entangled in a two - qubit space , @xmath0 ) , entanglement sharing was not analyzed in that instance , due to the difficulty of computing entanglement in such a hybrid qubit  continuous - variable system .",
    "fortunately , the theory of continuous variable entanglement has been in recent times developed , allowing for the exact , quantitative study of bipartite entanglement and its distribution in the special class of gaussian states @xcite , which includes , among others , squeezed , coherent and thermal states of harmonic oscillators .    here",
    ", we consider a free scalar field which is , from an inertial perspective , in a two - mode squeezed state .",
    "this choice of the state is motivated by different observations .",
    "first , the two - mode squeezed state is the paradigmatic entangled state of a continuous variable system , approximating to an arbitrarily good extent the einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) pair @xcite .",
    "second , the state can be produced in the lab and exploited for any current realization of bipartite quantum information with continuous variables @xcite .",
    "third , it belongs to the class of gaussian states , which admit an exact description of their classical and quantum correlations .",
    "since the unruh transformations @xcite are gaussian themselves ( _ i.e. _  they preserve the gaussian character of the state ) , it is possible to characterize analytically the redistribution of correlations due to relativistic effects .",
    "finally , the two - mode squeezed state has a special role in quantum field theory .",
    "it is possible to define particle states ( necessary in any entanglement discussion ) when the spacetime has at least two asymptotically flat regions @xcite . in this case",
    ", particle states commonly correspond to multi - mode squeezed states in which several field modes are in a pair - wise squeezed entangled state .",
    "the state we consider in our entanglement discussion is the simplest multi - mode squeezed state in which only two modes are entangled .",
    "a first investigation on the degradation of entanglement in a two - mode squeezed state due to the unruh effect has been recently reported @xcite .",
    "the entanglement degradation ( quantified by the logarithmic negativity @xcite ) was analyzed when one of the observers is accelerated and found to decrease more drastically when the entanglement described from the inertial perspective is stronger and to vanish in the infinite acceleration limit .",
    "we perform an extensive study of both quantum ( entanglement ) and classical correlations of the two - mode squeezed state from a non - inertial perspective .",
    "our work aims at a conclusive understanding and characterization of the relativistic effects on continuous variable correlations described by observers in uniform acceleration .",
    "therefore , we evaluate not only the bipartite entanglement as degraded by the unruh thermalization , but remarkably , the multipartite entanglement which arises among all rindler modes .",
    "our analysis is possible thanks to recent analytical results on entanglement sharing and the quantification of multipartite entanglement in gaussian states .",
    "this analysis relays on the _ contangle _ , which is a computable measure of entanglement @xcite .",
    "the contangle for mixed states is not fully equivalent to the negativity .",
    "therefore , in the case of a single accelerated observer , our results will evidence significant differences with the results presented in ref .",
    "the main novel result we find in this case , is that in the infinite acceleration limit , all the bipartite entanglement described by inertial observers is exactly redistributed into genuine tripartite correlations between the modes described by one inertial and two non - inertial observers ( one real and one fictitious , or virtual ) , as a consequence of the monogamy constraints on entanglement distribution @xcite .",
    "we also analyze total correlations , finding that the classical correlations are invariant under acceleration when one observer is accelerated .",
    "furthermore , we present an original analysis of the unruh effect on continuous variable entanglement when both observers undergo uniform acceleration .",
    "this analysis yields a series of significant new results .",
    "first , the bipartite entanglement described by non - inertial observers may vanish completely at finite acceleration even when the state contains an infinite amount of entanglement from the point of view of inertial observers .",
    "second , the acceleration induces a redistribution of entanglement , such that the modes described from a non - inertial perspective are correlated via a genuine four - partite entanglement .",
    "this entanglement increases unboundedly with the acceleration , easily surpassing the original inertial bipartite entanglement .",
    "third , classical correlations are also degraded as function of the acceleration .",
    "the degradation is of at most one unit with respect to the case of a single non - inertial observer . moreover",
    ", we study the dependence of the bipartite entanglement on the frequency of the modes described by the non - inertial observers , finding that with increasing acceleration the range of entangled frequencies gets narrower and narrower , becoming empty in the limit of infinite acceleration .",
    "our results are on one hand an interesting application of the continuous variable quantum information techniques ( commonly confined to quantum optics or light ",
    "matter interfaces ) to a relativistic setting , and on the other hand , provide a deeper understanding of the characterization of the inherent relativistic effects on the distribution of information .",
    "this may lead to a better understanding of the behavior of information in presence of a black hole @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ secgauss ]",
    "we introduce the basic tools of quantum information with gaussian states of continuous variable systems and we discuss the mechanism of entanglement sharing . in section [ secunruh ]",
    "we describe the unruh effect and its consequences on the entanglement between two field modes . in section [ secone ] , we study distributed entanglement between modes of a free scalar field when one observer is accelerated .",
    "the case when both observers are accelerated , resulting in a four - partite entangled state , is studied in section [ sectwo ] .",
    "both sections [ secone ] and [ sectwo ] include an analysis of the dependence of classical correlations under acceleration of the observers .",
    "finally , in section [ secconcl ] we draw our concluding remarks and compare our results to those obtained in the case of dirac fields @xcite .",
    "entanglement in continuous variable ( cv ) systems is encoded in the form of einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) correlations @xcite .",

    "therefore , the state contains infinite entanglement .",
    "the epr state is unnormalizable and unphysical .",
    "the two - mode squeezed state is an arbitrarily good approximation of it with increasing squeezing , and therefore represents a key resource for practical implementations of cv quantum information protocols @xcite .",
    "mathematically , squeezed states belong to the class of _ gaussian states _ of cv systems , _",
    "i.e. _  states with gaussian characteristic functions and quasi - probability distributions , whose structural and informational properties have been intensively studied in recent times @xcite .      in view of the subsequent analysis , it is sufficient to recall that gaussian states of @xmath10 modes are completely described in phase space ( up to local unitaries ) by the real , symmetric covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath11 , whose entries are @xmath12 . here",

    "the positive partial transpose ( ppt ) criterion states that a gaussian cm @xmath29 is separable ( with respect to a @xmath30 bipartition ) if and only if the partially transposed cm @xmath31 satisfies the uncertainty principle given by eq .",

    "the analysis of the mutual information shows that in this case classical correlations are conserved independently of the acceleration .",
    "the situation changes drastically by considering that both observers are accelerated . in this case",
    "the entanglement lost from the non - inertial perspective is re - distributed into mainly four - partite correlations although some tripartite correlations exist for finite acceleration . the surprising result here",
    "( though expected in the framework of distributed entanglement , as the additional fourth mode comes into play ) is that entanglement vanishes completely at a finite acceleration .",
    "this is also drastically different to the results in the dirac case where entanglement remains positive for all accelerations ( as a direct consequence of the restricted hilbert space in that instance ) .",
    "another surprising result is this case is that we find that classical correlations are no longer invariant to acceleration but are also degraded to some extent .",
    "we analyzed the entanglement between the modes of the field described by two accelerated observers as a function of their frequencies , and found that for a fixed acceleration high frequency modes remain entangled while lower frequency modes disentangle . in the limit of infinitely accelerated observers ,",
    "the field modes are in a separable state for any pair of frequencies .",
    "the tools developed in this paper can be used to investigate the problem of information loss in black holes @xcite .",
    "there is a correspondence between the rindler - minkowski frames and the schwarzschild - kruskal frames @xcite that allows us to study the loss ( and re - distribution ) of quantum and classical correlations for observers describing entangled modes outside the black hole , extending and re - interpreting the results presented in sec .",
    "[ sectwo ] of this paper . in that case",
    "the degradation of correlations can be understood as essentially being due to the hawking effect @xcite .",
