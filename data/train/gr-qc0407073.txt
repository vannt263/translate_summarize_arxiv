    "the singularities of classical general relativity , when specialized to homogeneous , isotropic models , manifest as reaching zero physical volume at finite synchronous time in the past . this",
    "in turn imply unbounded growth of space - time curvature and of matter densities etc and signals break down of the evolution equations at finite time in the past .",
    "it is widely believed that this feature of the classical theory will be modified in a quantum theory of gravity and recent development of _ loop quantum cosmology _ ( lqc ) @xcite , corroborate this expectation @xcite .",
    "the mechanism of ` singularity avoidance ' @xcite involves replacement of the classical evolution equation by a quantum one which is a _ difference equation _",
    "@xcite thanks to the necessity of using holonomy operators in the quantization of the hamiltonian constraint in lqc .",
    "this equation exhibits the property that the quantum wave function can be evolved through zero volume unambiguously .",
    "in addition , the discreteness of the triad operator ( having zero eigenvalue ) necessitates defining inverse triad operator ( or inverse scale factor operator ) @xcite indirectly .",
    "thanks to the loop representation on the ( non - separable ) kinematical hilbert space of lqc @xcite , these operators get so defined as to have a bounded spectrum implying only a bounded growth of curvatures / matter densities .",
    "this is true for all allowed values of the ambiguity parameters @xcite .",
    "the non - separable structure of the kinematical hilbert space of lqc however , also implies a huge set of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint ( a continuous infinity in the gravitational sector alone ) .",
    "presumably , a suitable choice of physical inner product can be made to cut down the size of the admissible solutions of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "a choice of inner product however is not yet available .",
    "the exploration of dirac observables is also at a preliminary stage @xcite .",
    "the general issue of whether or not the non - separable kinematical hilbert space is mandatory , is currently an open issue @xcite . in the present work",
    "however we assume the current framework of lqc @xcite .    despite the open issues ,",
    "it is possible to develop a wkb type semi - classical approximation from which an _ effective continuum hamiltonian constraint _ can be deduced @xcite .",
    "this at once gives access to the usual classical hamiltonian methods to construct and analyze the quantum modified space - time .",
    "this method relies on a _ continuum approximation _ @xcite of the underlying difference equation to the wheeler ",
    "dewitt differential equation followed by the wkb ansatz for its solutions . for large volume corresponding to classical regime , the continuum approximation is always available , in fact as a requirement on quantization of the hamiltonian operator . in this regime ,",
    "the wkb ansatz naturally reproduces the classical hamiltonian as the leading @xmath0 term .",
    "we would like to extend this method also to small volumes .",
    "the large freedom offered by the non - separable structure of the kinematical hilbert space can be exploited to propose a _ restriction _ to those solutions of the hamiltonian constraint for which a continuum approximation is valid for _ all _ volumes .",
    "one can then develop the effective classical hamiltonian constraint for all volumes and explore its consequences .",
    "in this work we develop such a picture and in comparison with the usual frw equations identify the effective density and pressure which includes the contributions of quantum fluctuations of the geometry . some elementary consequences are also noted .",
    "further implications for phenomenology are discussed in separate papers @xcite .    in section",
    "ii , we detail the effective hamiltonian constraint for isotropic models . in section iii , we discuss the qualitative features of the corresponding dynamics namely , the possibility of ` bounce ' solutions as well as solutions that could attempt to ` pass through ' the zero volume and connect to the oppositely oriented isotropic universe .",
    "we discuss what features of the quantum evolution are captured by the effective classical evolution . in section iv , we summarize our conclusions and outlook .",
    "the kinematical hilbert space @xcite is conveniently described in terms of the eigenstates of the densitized triad operator , @xmath1    the action of the volume operator on the triad basis states are given by @xmath2    in the isotropic context we have two classes to consider , namely spatially flat and close models .",
    "the quantization of the corresponding hamiltonian operators is given in @xcite . by introducing a parameter @xmath3",
    "we can deal both classes together .",
    "the values @xmath4 and @xmath5 will give the flat and the close models respectively .",
    "the action of the gravitational hamiltonian on the triad basis states is then given by @xmath6    here , @xmath7 is a quantization ambiguity parameter which enters through the fiducial length of the loops used in defining the holonomies .",
    "it is a real number of the order of 1 .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian connects states differing in their labels by @xmath8 .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the use of holonomy operators which have to be used in the quantization of the hamiltonian operator and is responsible for leading to a difference equation below .",
    "a general kinematical state @xmath9 , in the triad basis has the form @xmath10    the hamiltonian constraint of the classical theory is promoted as a condition to define physical states , i.e. , @xmath11    in terms of @xmath12 and the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hamcons ] ) translates into a difference equation , @xmath13 @xmath14 is a symbolic eigenvalue and we have assumed that the matter couples to the gravity via the metric component and _ not _ through the curvature component . in particular , @xmath15 .",
    "there are a few points about the above equation worth noting explicitly .",
    "although @xmath16 takes all possible real values , the equation connects the @xmath17 coefficients only in steps of @xmath18 making it a difference equation for the coefficients . by putting @xmath19",
    ", one can see that one has a continuous infinity of independent solutions of the difference equation , labelled by @xmath20 . for each @xmath21",
    "an infinity of coefficients , @xmath22 , are determined by 2 ` initial conditions ' since the order of the difference equation in terms of these coefficients is 2 .",
    "coefficients belonging to different @xmath21 are mutually decoupled . since the coefficients @xmath23 and the symbolic eigenvalues @xmath14 , both vanish for @xmath24 , the coefficient @xmath25 _ decouples _ from all other coefficients .    for large values of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) , which correspond to large volume ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath23 become almost constant ( up to a common factor of @xmath28 ) and the matter contribution is also expected similarly to be almost constant .",
    "one then expects the coefficients to vary slowly as @xmath29 is varied .",
    "this suggests interpolating these slowly varying _ sequences _ of coefficients by slowly varying _ functions _ of the continuous variable @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the difference equation satisfied by the coefficients then implies a _ differential _ equation for the interpolating functions which turns out to be _ independent _ of @xmath31 and matches with the usual wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation of quantum cosmology .",
    "this is referred to as a continuum approximation @xcite .",
    "this is of course what one expects if lqc dynamics is to exhibit a semi - classical behavior .",
    "while admissibility of continuum approximation is well motivated for large volume , one also expects it to be a poor approximation for smaller planck scale volumes .",
    "this logic is valid when applied to any _ one _ of the solutions @xmath32 .",
    "thanks to the non - separable structure of the hilbert space , we have an infinity of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "although @xmath32 are uncorrelated for different @xmath21 , nothing prevents us from _ choosing _ them to be suitably correlated . in effect",
    "this amounts to viewing @xmath17 themselves as _ functions _ of the continuous variable @xmath16 and stipulating some properties for them . in the absence of a physical inner product",
    ", we do nt have any criteria to select the class of solution .",
    "it is then useful to study properties of classes of solutions of the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "the class that we will concentrate on is the class of _ slowly varying _ functions . for these we will be able to have a continuum approximation leading to a differential equation . making a wkb approximation for this differential equation",
    ", we will read - off the effective classical hamiltonian constraint . in anticipation of making contact with a classical description",
    ", we will use the dimensionful variable @xmath33 as the continuous variable .",
    "correspondingly , we define @xmath34 which provides a convenient _ scale _ to demarcate different regimes in @xmath35 .",
    "we also use the notation : @xmath36 .",
    "now the definition of a slowly varying function is simple : @xmath37 is _ locally slowly varying around @xmath38 _ if @xmath39 with successive terms smaller than the preceding terms , for @xmath40 .",
    "it is slowly varying if it is locally slowly varying around every @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "note that even an exponentially rising function can be locally slowly varying if the exponent is sufficiently small .    to explore the possibility of slowly varying solutions of the difference equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) , consider the difference equation more explicitly . for @xmath42 ,",
    "putting @xmath43 and momentarily ignoring the matter term for notational simplicity , the difference equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) can be written as , @xmath44 s_{n + 1}(\\nu ) + \\left[\\frac{- a_n(\\nu)}{a_{n + 2}(\\nu)}\\right ] s_n(\\nu ) \\label{diffeqn}\\ ] ] its general solution can be written as @xmath45 , where the @xmath46 are fixed functions of @xmath21 determined by the same difference equation ( [ diffeqn ] ) with the ` initial ' conditions : @xmath47 and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are arbitrary functions of @xmath42 .",
    "( the linearity of the equation means that only the ratio @xmath50 ( say ) parameterizes the general solution . )",
    "it is clear that the arbitrary functions allow us to control the variation of @xmath17 within an interval of width @xmath18 . at the integral values of @xmath51 corresponding to @xmath52",
    ", there is a consistency condition coming from vanishing of the highest ( lowest ) order coefficient which fixes the ratio of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the values of @xmath55 are fixed ( up to overall scaling ) .",
    "the slowly varying class of functions will be assumed to approximate these exact values .",
    "the continuum approximation developed below may not be a good approximation at a _",
    "finite _ subset of these values corresponding to smaller @xmath29 .    with these remarks ,",
    "we now proceed to derive consequences from the assumption of ( every where ) slowly varying , approximate solutions of the difference equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) .",
    "defining @xmath56 and substituting @xmath17 in terms of slowly varying @xmath37 in the difference equation ( [ differenceeqn ] ) , leads to the differential equation , @xmath57    in the above equation , terms involving higher derivatives of @xmath37 have been neglected as being sub - leading in the context of slowly varying solutions .",
    "this is not quite the continuum approximation referred to earlier since there is @xmath31 dependence hidden inside @xmath58 appearing explicitly in the coefficients of the differential equation .",
    "this is also not quite the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation since this equation is valid over the entire real line ( since @xmath35 can take negative values corresponding to oppositely oriented triad ) while the wheeler  dewitt equation using the scale factor as independent variable is defined only for half real line .    from the definitions of the coefficients @xmath59 ,",
    "it is obvious that under @xmath60 ( change of orientation of the triad ) , @xmath61 and the gravitational part of @xmath62 are all _ odd _ while @xmath63 is _",
    "even_. for notational convenience we restrict to @xmath64 while writing the limiting expressions , the expressions for negative @xmath35 can be obtained from the odd / even properties noted above .",
    "there are two obvious regimes to explore which are conveniently demarcated by the scale @xmath58 , namely , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the corresponding limiting forms for the coefficients @xmath67 are easily obtained .",
    "one gets , @xmath68    notice that for large volume the explicit @xmath58 dependence cancels out .",
    "this equation corresponds to the usual continuum approximation which has no dependence on @xmath31 and matches with the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation in a particular factor ordering . for small volume ,",
    "the @xmath58 dependence survives , is non - trivial and the coefficient of the first derivative terms is non - zero . in view of the even / odd properties of the coefficients , it follows that the first derivative of @xmath37 must vanish at @xmath69 .",
    "further more , even for the flat model without matter , the @xmath62 coefficient is non - zero .",
    "had we extrapolated the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation from the large volume form , we would not have gotten these terms .",
    "thus the quantum differential equation ( [ masterdiffeqn ] ) agrees with the wheeler ",
    "dewitt for large volume but differs significantly for small volume .",
    "the small volume form of the equation in fact shows that there are two possible behaviors namely @xmath70 constant or @xmath37 diverges as an inverse power of @xmath35 .",
    "neither of the indicial roots depend on the matter hamiltonian .",
    "the latter solution is not slowly varying and the former one implies that the wave function has a non - zero value at @xmath69 and the wave function can obviously be continued to negative @xmath35 .",
    "thus the differential equation derived for slowly varying functions is both consistent at zero volume and mimics main features of the difference equations namely passing through zero volume and matching with wheeler ",
    "dewitt for large volume .    in the earlier quantization of isotropic models @xcite based on point holonomies taking values in @xmath71 representations ( separable hilbert space ) ,",
    "the decoupling of @xmath72 coefficient also implied a consistency condition which helped select a unique solution @xcite from solutions of the wheeler ",

    "with the non - separable hilbert space , such a condition can only result from @xmath73 family of coefficients .",
    "nevertheless , one has gotten a _",

    "it is crucial here that for small @xmath74 , the @xmath63 coefficient has a non - vanishing limit which forces the first derivative to vanish at @xmath75 .",
    "( if the single derivative term has been dropped , both solutions would have been slowly varying near @xmath69 . )    in summary , with the restriction to slowly varying solutions , we have a continuum approximation ( differential equation ) valid for all values of the triad .",
    "further more the differential equation permits a unique solution ( for each matter state ) passing through @xmath69 .    for future reference",
    "we also note that the differential equation admits a ` conserved current ' .",
    "taking imaginary part of @xmath76 times the differential equation leads to , @xmath77    defining @xmath78 such that @xmath79 determines the function @xmath80 .",

    "the real and the imaginary parts of the equation , equations([realpart ] , [ impart ] ) , then imply that @xmath99 and @xmath100 both vanish , which is consistent with @xmath101 constant , as deduced directly from the differential equation ( [ masterdiffeqn ] ) .    to interpret the effective hamiltonian constraint as generating the space - time dynamics ,",

    "the basic variables of lqc are first obtained for a general homogeneous bianchi class a models with the maurer - cartan forms normalized in the usual manner .",

    "these two normalizations match provided @xmath110 . to avoid writing the suffixes",
    ", we just note that while comparing the large volume hamiltonian constraint with the standard friedmann equation , one should use the replacement @xmath111 .",
    "this of course is relevant only for the close model .",
    "in the previous section we derived the effective hamiltonian constraint ( [ effhamiltonian ] ) , using a continuum approximation keeping terms up to _ second _ derivatives and using the wkb approximation . if we include higher derivative terms that these would give _ perturbative _ corrections in the large volume .",
    "our focus is however on the small volume regime and leading corrections which for the matter sector include non - perturbative corrections . for our purposes",
    "the truncation to second derivatives suffices .    for large volume",
    ", we already see that the effective hamiltonian reduces to the classical one to within terms of the order of @xmath112 .",
    "we are interested in checking if the effective dynamics is non - singular and precisely in what sense . for this",
    "it is sufficient to focus on the small volume expressions .",
    "we will compare the classical hamiltonian ( [ largevolh ] ) extrapolated to small volume and the effective hamiltonian ( [ smallvolh ] ) .",
    "consider first the classical case .",
    "as the scale factor goes to zero , the matter density diverges either as @xmath113 for pressure - less matter or as @xmath114 for radiation .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath115 either goes to a non - negative constant or diverges as @xmath116 .",
    "the hamiltonian constraint then implies that @xmath88 necessarily diverges .",
    "as is well known , in both cases the scale factor vanishes at a _ finite _ value of synchronous time and this of course is the big bang singularity .",
    "this also suggests a necessary condition for singular evolution : @xmath69 should be reachable in finite time .",
    "equivalently , if @xmath69 is _ not _ reachable in finite time , the evolution is non - singular .    momentarily ,",
    "assume _ that for some reason , the matter hamiltonian _ vanishes _ as the scale factor goes to zero , then @xmath88 must remain finite and @xmath69 is indeed on the constraint surface .",
    "further more @xmath117 evaluated at @xmath69 is also zero implying that @xmath69 is a _ fixed point _ ( rather a fixed ` sub - manifold ' of the phase space of gravity and matter ) .",
    "the @xmath69 trajectories of the dynamics are then not accessible in finite time and the evolution is non - singular . clearly",
    "( non- ) divergence of matter hamiltonian dictates ( non- ) singular evolution .    for generic ( non - singular ) trajectories , there are two possibilities now . either ( a ) @xmath69 is approached asymptotically as @xmath118 or ( b ) the trajectory exhibits a bounce , @xmath119 at a finite , non - zero @xmath35 . for example , in the case of scalar matter , with lqc modifications included , the former is realized for flat models ( @xmath4 ) while the latter is realized for close models ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "consider now the quantum case .",
    "the matter hamiltonian is guaranteed to vanish due to the inverse volume operator definition .",
    "the arguments for @xmath69 being fixed point apply .",

    "this is exactly the same feature exhibited by the fundamental difference equation .",
    "the exact solution @xmath121 completely decouples from all other solutions .",
    "the bounce is then a completely generic feature of isotropic lqc . but",
    "a bounce also provides _ a minimum volume _ for the isotropic universe whose value is dependent on matter hamiltonian .",
    "such a natural , generic scale has implications for phenomenology as well @xcite .    notice that while interpreting the effective hamiltonian as a ( modified ) constraint equation , we are keeping the kinematics of space - time ( a pseudo - riemannian manifold ) intact .",

    "write the effective hamiltonian ( [ effhamiltonian ] ) in the form , @xmath122 putting @xmath123 ( @xmath124 is the frw scale factor and @xmath125 ) and denoting @xmath126 by @xmath127 leads to , @xmath128 \\label{reqn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with the usual frw equations , we _ identify _ effective perfect fluid density and pressure as , @xmath129 the large and small volume expressions for the effective density and pressure are , @xmath130 the effective density and pressure receive contributions from the matter sector and also the spatial curvature ( @xmath3-dependent terms ) . apart from these , the homogeneous and isotropic quantum fluctuations of the geometry also contribute an effective density and pressure ( @xmath120 terms ) . while tiny , these are non - zero even for large volume .",
    "notice also that while for large volume the spatial curvature does not contribute to the density and pressure , for small volume it does . as a by product",
    ", we have also obtained the density and pressure for matter , _ directly in terms of the matter hamiltonian .",
    "_ this is useful because currently lqc modifications to the matter sector are incorporated at the level of the hamiltonian and not at the level of an action .",

    "this immediately implies that in the absence of matter ( and cosmological constant ) , all the three terms in the effective hamiltonian must be individually zero which is not possible for the quantum geometry potential . in other words",
    ", there is no solution space - time .",
    "this is in contrast to the purely classical hamiltonian which does give the minkowski space - time as a solution for the flat case ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this is also apparent from the non - zero value of the effective density which prevents the minkowski solution .",
    "this feature can also be understood in the following manner .",
    "the differential equation has a unique solution ( which is slowly varying every where ) .",
    "this solution is however purely real and does not admit a wkb form .",
    "consequently , the universe does not admit any ` classically allowed region ' in the wkb sense and thus also does not exhibit a classical behavior .",
    "once matter is included , we have again a unique , real solution of the differential equation _ for every matter state_. we can now have complex linear combinations admitting possibility of regimes of wkb form and corresponding classical behavior .",
    "it is straight forward to write down a lagrangian from the @xmath144 as , @xmath145 \\label{efflagrangian}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it would be interesting to see if this lagrangian can be obtained from a specialization of a generally covariant action to homogeneous , isotropic metric .",
    "the results of this paper are based on two essential ingredients : the proposal of a continuum approximation for all volumes exploiting the non - separable nature of the kinematical hilbert space and the derivation of the effective hamiltonian via the wkb route .",
    "the continuum approximation step leads to a differential equation for a ( still ) quantum wave function , @xmath37 .",
    "this equation matches with the wheeler ",
    "dewitt equation for large volume and has important deviations ( the first derivative terms ) from it at small volumes .",
    "these deviations allow continuation of the wave function through zero volume just as the fundamental difference equation does . for slowly varying solutions",
    ", it picks out the ` boundary ' condition @xmath146 .",
    "again this is analogous to unique solution ( per matter state ) picked out by the difference equation obtained from the @xmath71 point holonomies in the earlier work @xcite .",
    "thus the essential features of the fundamental difference equation namely non - singular quantum evolution with semi - classical limit are captured by the continuum differential equation .",
    "the effective dynamics specified by the effective hamiltonian deduced via the wkb approximation also reflects these features .",
    "the effective dynamics is non - singular , captures the decoupling of the @xmath147 exact solution of the difference equation by making the classical @xmath69 trajectory decouple and reduces to the usual classical dynamics of general relativity for large volumes .",
    "since the essential features of quantum dynamics are now captured in classical geometrical terms , the effective dynamics is more reliable than the usual one and one can now simply work with the effective dynamics to do phenomenology .",
    "already , at the qualitative level , one sees that all non - trivial evolutions necessarily show a bounce providing a natural scale for say , density perturbations and their power spectra .      from the continuum quantum dynamics , with the wkb approximation , one obtains a hamilton - jacobi equation . as a mathematical result , any hamilton - jacobi differential equation has an associated hamiltonian mechanics @xcite and corresponding trajectories . in our context",
    ", we are interpreting these trajectories as possible evolutions of the isotropic universe .",
    "there is at least an implicit implication ( or assumption ) that a quantum system executing a wkb approximable quantum motion _ physically _ exhibits a classical motion governed by the hamiltonian associated with the corresponding hamilton - jacobi equation .",
    "the justification for this comes from noting that for large volume we expect the universe to exhibit classical behavior and there it is indeed governed by the associated hamiltonian .",
    "for how small volumes can we assume this expectation ?",
    "this question is naturally related to the domain of validity of the wkb approximation .",
    "one expects the wkb approximation ( slow variation of the phase and almost constancy of the amplitude of the wave function ) to break down closer to the classically indicated singularity at zero volume . noting that the differential equation is local in @xmath35 and its solutions are also local solutions ( valid in open intervals in @xmath35 )",
    ", we can begin with a wkb approximable solution valid in the larger volume regime and attempt to extrapolate it to smaller and smaller volumes .",
    "all through these extensions , one will have the effective hamiltonian with its associated trajectories which can access the values of @xmath35 in these intervals .",
    "the effective hamiltonian constraint defines a submanifold of the phase space and all trajectories must lie on this .",
    "the range of configuration space variables ( eg @xmath35 in our case ) allowed by the submanifold defines ` classically allowed region ' . as is well known from the usual examples in non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the wkb approximation breaks down at the ` turning points ' .",
    "these correspond to the boundary of classically allowed region which therefore demarcates the domain of validity of wkb approximation .",
    "clearly , when such a boundary is reached by a trajectory , it must turn back .",
    "this is of course the bounce ( @xmath148 ) .",
    "the expectation that wkb breaks down at non - zero volume translates into the expectation of a bounce occurring at non - zero scale factor .",
    "the bounce can thus be understood as the smallest volume ( or scale factor ) down to which one may use the classical framework with some justification but below it one must use the quantum framework . more details of the bounce picture as well as its genericness are discussed in @xcite .",
    "further justification comes from other known examples .",
    "for example , solutions of the maxwell equations in the eikonal approximation can be understood in terms of the normals to the wave fronts which follow null geodesic .",
    "the interpretation that this actually reflects rectilinear motion of light , may be justified by noting that the poynting vector ( energy flow ) is also in the same direction as the normals . likewise , in the context of usual schrodinger equation of particle mechanics , the conserved probability current also points along the normals to the wave fronts giving credence to the interpretation that a quantum state of the wkb form realizes motion of a particle ( or wave packet ) governed by the associated hamiltonian mechanics . in both these examples , further inputs other than the mathematical association between hamilton - jacobi differential equation and a hamiltonian system , seem to be needed to understand the physical realization of the hamiltonian system .",
    "interestingly , the equation ( [ masterdiffeqn ] ) does admit a conserved current ( [ conservedcurrent ] ) which indeed is proportional to the gradient of the wkb phase . whether this could be used for guessing physical inner product vis a vis a probability interpretation remains to be seen .",
