    "recent advances in numerical relativity ( nr ) have led to an increasing interest in the astrophysical implications of black hole ( bh ) mergers . of particular interest",
    "is the possibility of a distinct , luminous electromagnetic ( em ) counterpart to a gravitational wave ( gw ) signal @xcite .",
    "if such an em counterpart could be identified with a lisa detection of a supermassive bh binary in the merging process , then the host galaxy could likely be determined . a large variety of potential em signatures",
    "have recently been proposed , almost all of which require some significant amount of gas in the near vicinity of the merging bhs .",
    "gas in the form of accretion disks around single massive bhs is known to produce some of the most luminous objects in the universe . however , very little is known about the behavior of accretion disks around _ two _ bhs , particularly at late times in their inspiral evolution . in newtonian disks",
    ", it is believed that a circumbinary accretion disk will have a central gap of much lower density , either preventing accretion altogether , or at least decreasing it significantly @xcite .",
    "when including the evolution of the binary due to gw losses , the bhs may also decouple from the disk at the point when the gw inspiral time becomes shorter than the gaseous inflow time at the inner edge of the disk @xcite .",
    "this decoupling should effectively stop accretion onto the central object until the gap can be filled on an inflow timescale . however , other semi - analytic calculations predict an enhancement of accretion power as the evolving binary squeezes the gas around the primary bh , leading to a rapid increase in luminosity shortly before merger @xcite .    setting aside for the moment the question of _ how _ the gas can or can not reach the central bh region , a number of recent papers have shown that _ if _ there is sufficient gas present , then an observable em signal is likely .",
    "@xcite used analytic arguments to estimate a peak luminosity comparable to that of the eddington limit , independent of the detailed mechanisms for shocking and heating the gas . using relativistic magneto - hydrodynamic simulations in 2d",
    ", @xcite showed that the prompt mass loss due to gws actually leads to a sudden _ decrease _ in luminosity following the merger , as the gas in the inner disk temporarily has too much energy and angular momentum to accrete efficiently .",
    "full nr simulations of the final few orbits of a merging bh binary have now been carried out including the presence of em fields in a vacuum @xcite and also gas , treated as test particles in @xcite and as an ideal fluid in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the simulations including matter all suggest that the gas can get shocked and heated to high temperatures , thus leading to bright counterparts in the event that sufficient gas is in fact present",
    ". one estimate of `` sufficient '' is the condition that the gas be optically thick to electron scattering , which will lead to eddington - rate luminosities @xcite .",
    "thus we require @xmath2 , where @xmath3 @xmath4g@xmath5 is the opacity and @xmath6 is the characteristic density over a length scale @xmath7 .",
    "then the total mass is a modest @xmath8 g , where @xmath9 .",
    "more gas will generally lead to longer , but not necessarily more luminous signals .",
    "the motivation for this work is to understand potential dynamical processes that could lead to a significant amount of gas around the bhs at the time of merger .",
    "we focus on stable orbits in the circular , restricted three - body problem , i.e. , a system with two massive objects orbiting each other on circular , planar keplerian orbits , with the third body being a test particle free to move out of the plane .",
    "gas or stars that get captured into these stable regions at large binary separation may remain trapped as the binary orbit shrinks due to radiation reaction . in this paper , we integrate the restricted three - body equations of motion in the corotating frame for a range of bh mass ratios , including the evolution of the binary with leading - order post - newtonian gw losses . with the exception of these non - conservative corrections ,",
    "all dynamics are considered at the purely newtonian level .",
    "we find that particles initially close to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lagrange points remain on stable orbits throughout the adiabatic evolution of the bh binary .",
    "this result immediately leads to a number of astrophysical predictions .",
    "if diffuse gas is captured from the surrounding medium , and irradiated by an accretion disk around either bh , it may produce strong , relatively narrow emission lines with large velocity shifts , varying on an orbital time scale .",
    "if individual stars are captured , they may eventually get tidally disrupted by one of the bhs shortly before merger , providing an enormous source of material for accretion .",
    "stars may also get ejected from the system at late times , producing ultra - hyper - velocity stars moving away from the galactic center at a significant fraction of the speed of light .",
    "clusters of stars could also get captured or form _ in situ _ at large binary separation , then get compressed adiabatically as the bh system shrinks , ultimately collapsing from gravitational instabilities .",
    "compact objects such as neutron stars or stellar - mass bhs would not get tidally disrupted in most cases , but could still possibly be detected with lisa as perturbations to the gw signal .",
    "while this manuscript was in preparation , a similar work by @xcite was published , with some of the same conclusions .",
    "one major distinction is that they included first - order post - newtonian terms in their equations of motion , while we do not .",
    "also , they `` have not found notable qualitative differences '' between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , while we do .",
    "many of our astronomical predictions are qualitatively similar , but have been derived independently .",
    "the outline for this paper is as follows : in section [ location_stability ] we present the three - body equations of motion , including gw losses , and analyze the stability and location of the equilibrium lagrange points .",
    "these analytic predictions are tested in section [ numerical_tests ] with numerical simulations of a large number of test particles . in section [ applications ]",
    "we explore in more detail some potential astronomical applications of these results , and in section [ discussion ] we conclude .",
    "we consider a three - body system wherein the larger bodies have masses @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ; @xmath13 and the third object is a test particle of negligible mass @xmath14 .",
    "we define dimensionless masses @xmath15 and @xmath16 . @xmath10 and @xmath11 move on circular , keplerian orbits around the center of mass at the origin with semi - major axis @xmath17 . unless otherwise stated , we use geometrized units with @xmath18 . in the corotating frame",
    "we define coordinates @xmath19 , with the primary bh located at @xmath20 and the secondary at @xmath21 .",
    "the angular velocity of the system in the lab frame is @xmath22 .",
    "the binary is orbiting in the @xmath23 direction for the standard definition of spherical coordinates .",
    "the equations of motion for the test particle may be written as    @xmath24 \\\\",
    "\\label{eomb } \\ddot{y } & = & -2n\\dot{x}+n^2y -\\dot{n}x- \\left[\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1 ^ 3}+\\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2 ^ 3}\\right]y \\\\ \\label{eomc } \\ddot{z } & = & -\\left[\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1 ^ 3}+\\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2 ^ 3}\\right]z \\\\",
    "\\label{eomd } \\dot{n } & = & \\frac{96}{5}\\mu_1\\mu_2 n^{11/3 } \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the distances to the primary and secondary bodies , respectively .",
    "these reproduce the classical newtonian system in the limit of @xmath27 , i.e.  when gravitational radiation reaction is turned off .",
    "it is well - known from classical mechanics that there exist five equilibrium points where a test particle can remain at rest in the corotating frame ( @xmath28 ) @xcite .",
    "these points are known as the lagrange equilibrium points @xmath29 , and are plotted in figure [ cj_cont ] for a binary with mass ratio @xmath30 .",
    "the co - linear points @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are always unstable , while the triangular points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are linearly stable only for @xmath34 @xcite . in the newtonian problem , there is a single integral of motion , the jacobi constant : @xmath35 setting the particle s velocity to zero in the corotating frame , the contours of constant @xmath36 in the @xmath37 plane define `` zero velocity curves , '' as plotted in figure [ cj_cont ] .",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 are located at local minima of @xmath38 , while @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 are saddle - points ( note that @xmath39 has the form of a negative energy , so that local minima are actually points of maximum potential energy , yet are still stable to small perturbations because of the restoring coriolis forces in the rotating frame ) .",
    "one well - known implication of this feature is that gas bound to either @xmath10 or @xmath11 can pass through @xmath31 and subsequently accrete onto the other object , a process known as mass transfer in standard stellar binary evolution .",
    "additionally , any particle with @xmath40 would be excluded from crossing into the tadpole - shaped regions around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite explore the effects of generalized non - gravitational forces acting on test particles in the restricted three - body problem , including a detailed study of how the position and stability of the lagrange equilibrium points are affected . at first glance , our problem would seem quite similar , with the @xmath41 terms in equations ( [ eoma]),([eomb ] ) acting as psuedo - drag forces : as the binary orbit shrinks and @xmath42 increases , test particles would feel like they are accelerating in the @xmath43 direction in the corotating frame , thus slowing down in the inertial frame .",
    "in this case , @xcite show that @xmath0 and @xmath1 both move in the @xmath23 direction , thus compensating for the inertial drag and still maintaining @xmath44 .",
    "however , when considering the time - varying nature of @xmath42 and @xmath45 in equations ( [ eoma])-([eomd ] ) due to gw losses , we find that this drag force analogy breaks down . numerical integration of equations ( [ eoma])-([eomd ] ) show that in fact , the opposite occurs , with @xmath0 and @xmath1 moving in the @xmath43 direction in the rotating frame .",
    "remarkably , this result can still be understood via an inertial drag term , if one applies it not to the test particle , but to the secondary mass . in order to study the evolution of the trojan asteroids under the influence of a radial migration by jupiter",
    ", @xcite apply an artificial drag force that acts only on jupiter in the form @xmath46 in the inertial frame .",
    "of course , this causes the secondary to lose energy and angular momentum and thus orbit faster , increasing @xmath42 as in the bh binary case .",
    "since there is no requirement on the relative masses of the secondary @xmath11 and the test particle @xmath14 to ensure stability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite , we can in fact adopt the drag force analysis of @xcite to include gw losses by reversing the roles of the secondary bh and the test particle . in the rotating frame ,",
    "the inertial drag force is given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "for stationary particles at the equilibrium points , equations ( [ eoma]),([eomb ] ) become    @xmath49 \\\\ \\label{eom2b } \\bar{k}nx & = & n^2y -\\left[\\frac{\\mu_1}{r_1 ^ 3}+\\frac{\\mu_2}{r_2 ^ 3}\\right]y \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath50 , and we have replaced the gw acceleration terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 with those appropriate for drag forces @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in order to reproduce the gw evolution of equation ( [ eomd ] ) , we must choose the magnitude of the drag force appropriately .",
    "this is done by equating the energy loss due to the shrinking orbit with that of the inertial drag force .",
    "for circular keplerian orbits , we have @xmath55 and @xmath56 equating ( [ edot_drag ] ) and ( [ edot_gw ] ) , along with ( [ eomd ] ) allows us to solve for @xmath57 : @xmath58    following @xcite , we multiply equation ( [ eom2a ] ) by @xmath59 and add to ( [ eom2b ] ) times @xmath60 , giving @xmath61 in the limit of small @xmath62 , @xmath63 at the stable lagrange points and we can write @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the location of the lagrange point in the presence of an inertial drag force . when considering the orbital evolution due to gw losses , we can use equation ( [ kbar_gw ] ) for @xmath57 .",
    "we must also reverse the sign of @xmath65 because , as mentioned above , the gw drag force is really applied to @xmath11 and not to the test particle as in @xcite .",
    "we now have an expression for the location of the lagrange points in the presence of gw losses : @xmath66 this relation is plotted as a dashed curve in figure [ dphi ] .",
    "interestingly , to leading order , the location of the lagrange points is a function only of the binary orbital separation , _ not _ the mass ratio , even though the inspiral timescale is strongly dependent on @xmath62 .",
    "note that , when including non - conservative forces such as gw evolution , there is a lack of symmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with @xmath0 moving towards the secondary mass , while @xmath1 moves away from it .",
    "we also find differences in the relative stability of orbits around each lagrange point , as described in the next section .",
    "in figure [ dphi ] we plot the position of test particles near @xmath0 and @xmath1 as a function of the binary separation @xmath45 for a range of mass ratios .",
    "the initial binary separation is @xmath67 . for the most part ,",
    "the test particles remain very close to their initial locations throughout inspiral , evolving according to equation ( [ phi_l ] ) .",
    "while our newtonian equations of motion do not formally predict an inner - most stable circular orbit ( isco ) , we expect the bhs to plunge and merge around @xmath68 , at which point very little evolution in @xmath65 has taken place .",
    "the slight offsets in the various curves at large @xmath45 are due to the fact that @xmath69 is measured with respect to the origin , not @xmath10 .",
    "the inclusion of post - newtonian ( pn ) corrections to the equations of motion would likely change the shape of the curves in figure [ dphi ] slightly , as well as the detailed shape of stability regions around @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that @xcite include only 1pn terms , and do find a significant reduction in stability for certain mass ratios . yet due to the notoriously uneven convergence of most pn expansions ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , it is not clear whether their inclusion would add significant physical insight to the problem .     +    when studying inertial drag forces such as those described above , @xcite found that the @xmath0 point was more stable than @xmath1 .",
    "since our problem is the mirror - image of that one , it is not surprising then that we find greater stability around @xmath1 when including gw evolution . as shown in the upper panel of figure [ dphi ] for @xmath70 , a test particle initially very close to @xmath0",
    "will eventually get ejected from the equilibrium configuration as the binary approaches merger . on the other hand ,",
    "test particles librating around @xmath1 appear to become _ more _ stable , asymptotically approaching the exact equilibrium position . as mentioned in @xcite , for binaries with @xmath62 slightly above the critical value for linear stability ( @xmath71 ) , there still exist bound orbits that librate around @xmath0 and @xmath1 with moderate amplitude . we find that for these systems , the inclusion of radiation reaction increases the stability of @xmath1 by damping the libration amplitude . on the other hand , the libration amplitude of particles around @xmath0 grows rapidly towards the end of inspiral , as in the linear case in figure [ dphi ] .",
    "in contrast , @xcite find no difference between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , although they only consider a few test particles around each lagrange point .",
    "to further investigate this asymmetry in stability , we carried out orbital integrations for large numbers of test particles distributed in clouds around each lagrange point for masses @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 .",
    "this allowed us to probe the regions relatively far from the equilibrium points , where standard linear stability analysis breaks down .",
    "we used two methods for estimating the large - scale stability of orbits around each lagrange point .",
    "the first was a simple number count : the fraction of particles that remain bound around the equilibrium point . in this context , a particle is considered bound if its instantaneous jacobi constant @xmath39 is less than @xmath75 for the present orbital separation , corresponding to the tadpole - shaped regions around @xmath0 and @xmath1 in figure [ cj_cont ] .",
    "additionally , any particle that escapes with @xmath76 or approaches closer than @xmath77 from the primary or @xmath78 from the secondary is removed from the system .",
    "the second method of measuring stability was to calculate the total volume filled by bound particles around each lagrange point .",
    "a larger volume corresponds to lower stability , as the particles begin to escape the bound libration region .",
    "the fraction of bound particles @xmath79 is plotted in the top panels of figure [ n45_mu ] , normalized to the bound number at binary separation of @xmath80 .",
    "the particles begin in a small cloud of radius @xmath81 around each lagrange point with random velocities , isotropic with @xmath82 in the corotating frame .",
    "we select @xmath81 to be large enough so that the cloud of particles roughly fills the phase - space volume of stable orbits around @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in practice",
    ", this typically corresponds to half of the particles getting ejected on roughly a dynamical time after the start of the simulation ( hence @xmath79 is defined relative to @xmath80 , not @xmath83 ) . after a stable cloud",
    "is formed around each lagrange point , marginally bound particles are slowly ejected from the system ( or accreted onto one of the bhs ) as the binary system evolves adiabatically . from figure [ dphi ] , we might expect more particles to get ejected from @xmath0 , which appears to be less stable , at least at linear order .",
    "however , as evident in figure [ n45_mu ] , @xmath0 retains more bound particles when @xmath84 , @xmath1 appears more stable for @xmath30 , and they are nearly identical for @xmath70 .",
    "it is not entirely clear why this peculiar behavior occurs , with no apparent trend in global stability as a function of mass ratio , nor why one lagrange point or the other should be more stable for a given mass ratio .",
    "as described in @xcite , test particles near the stable lagrange points move along epicycles with two distinct frequencies . for certain values of @xmath62 ,",
    "these libration frequencies have integer commensurabilities , which naturally leads to strong resonant interactions @xcite . for example , when @xmath85 , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are stable under standard linear analysis , yet the two epicyclic frequencies have a ratio of @xmath86 , leading to resonant excitations and ejection of all test particles after a few dynamical times @xcite .",
    "@xcite shows that these characteristic frequencies change in the presence of inertial drag forces , which we have shown above to be directly analogous to gw evolution .",
    "thus we suspect that the different behavior seen in @xmath87 for different lagrange points is due to a combination of resonant interactions and asymmetric shifts in the libration frequencies due to the binary evolution via gw losses .    in the bottom panels of figure [ n45_mu ] we plot the total volume @xmath88 occupied by bound particles , normalized to the overall scale of the binary @xmath89 . in the limit of a very small @xmath90 , where the test particles are well within the linear regime",
    ", the cloud around each lagrange point will actually expand adiabatically relative to the binary separation , although shrinking on an absolute scale .",
    "@xcite show this evolution to scale as @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the initial and final volumes of test particle clouds .",
    "we have confirmed this result numerically with simulations starting with @xmath95 .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath90 is large enough such that the stable region of phase space is completely filled , the normalized volume @xmath96 should be constant , since the entire problem is scale - invariant .",
    "any adiabatic expansion will not increase the volume of bound orbits , but rather decrease the total number of particles in these regions , as seen in the upper panels of figure [ n45_mu ] .",
    "we actually find a gradual increase in @xmath97 as the binary shrinks , yet still much slower than the @xcite result of @xmath98 , suggesting that the bound region in phase space is in fact filled .",
    "the increase in @xmath99 during the adiabatic inspiral phase ( @xmath100 ) is likely due to a combination of effects .",
    "first , we expect a net increase in global stability caused by the gw losses , analogous to the effects of inertial drag described above .",
    "secondly , there is also some inherent error in measuring the volume of bound orbits , based on our crude metric of the test particles instantaneous jacobi constants .",
    "some fraction of particles that have moved outside the stable region may still appear bound for a few dynamical times before getting ejected or accreted , and thus artificially contribute to @xmath88 . at smaller @xmath45 , where the libration time becomes comparable to the inspiral time , the system no longer evolves adiabatically , and a cloud of particles can get `` frozen '' at roughly constant volume , leading to the rapid increase in @xmath99 for @xmath101 .",
    "interestingly , we do see a consistent trend of larger @xmath88 around @xmath0 than @xmath1 for all values of @xmath62 , as suggested by figure [ dphi ] .",
    "however , this may be less a measure of local stability than a consequence of the fact that @xmath0 moves _ toward _ the secondary , while @xmath1 moves away from it .",
    "thus the two regions begin to sample different potentials , and the gravitational force of the secondary acts to disrupt the cloud around @xmath0 more strongly than that around @xmath1 , in turn leading to a larger @xmath102 .",
    "we should add as a word of caution , that many of these numerical stability results may be altered somewhat by the inclusion of additional pn terms to the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "in general relativity , unlike the case of newtonian gravity , test particles moving in the kerr metric have three distinct epicyclic frequencies .",
    "these additional frequencies may lead to more complicated resonant interactions and thus change the behavior of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , at least at a quantitative level . yet",
    "our intuition suggests that the _ qualitative _ behavior shown in figure [ n45_mu ] should remain unchanged .",
    "future work will investigate this question in greater detail .",
    "in the previous sections , we showed analytically and numerically how the location and stability of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lagrange points evolve in the presence of radiation reaction .",
    "we found that test particles , once captured into libration orbits around one of the stable lagrange points , will in general remain there throughout the adiabatic inspiral phase , as the entire length scale of the system steadily shrinks .",
    "however , the initial premise was not addressed : will there even be gas or stars or debris present in the first place ? how might matter get captured into these orbits at large binary separations of @xmath105 pc ?",
    "furthermore , are binary bhs with @xmath106 astrophysically likely , or even possible ?    even in a system as well - studied as the sun - jupiter binary , there is still no clear consensus on the origin of the trojan asteroids , despite the fact that orbital elements are now known for over 4000 individual objects .",
    "@xcite proposed that they may be captured comets , while @xcite and @xcite suggested a more local origin as planetesimals in the early solar system . in most theories , some form of dissipative force is required to capture the trojans @xcite , such as nebular gas drag @xcite or planetesimal collisions @xcite .",
    "additionally , an increase in jupiter s mass via accretion of the surrounding disk could lead to asteroids getting captured @xcite .",
    "analogous to our bh binary system , the inward migration of jupiter may have also affected the capture and subsequent evolution of the trojans @xcite .",
    "the characteristic separation at which point a hard bh binary ( i.e. , the orbital potential is dominated by the two bhs , and not by the surrounding stars ) is formed is comparable to the primary bh s radius of influence @xcite : @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 with @xmath110 being the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of the galaxy s bulge . in the limit of small @xmath111",
    ", we have @xmath112 corresponding to @xmath113 in geometrized units . within this region , there are typically thousands of stars @xcite , and in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , a great deal of gas and dust as well .",
    "it is also roughly the separation at which point the binary will merge within a hubble time due to gw losses alone @xcite , and thus equations ( [ eoma])-([eomd ] ) are appropriate .    for agn with massive accretion disks , it is possible for significant star formation to occur in the region where the disk becomes self - gravitating @xcite . for standard thin disk models",
    "@xcite , this self - gravitating radius actually corresponds closely to @xmath114 .",
    "since galaxy mergers are often associated with gas inflow and quasar activity , it is quite possible that stars could form in an accretion disk just as a hard bh binary is forming , thereby trapping the stars around the stable lagrange points .",
    "a similar possibility , suggested by @xcite , is that supermassive stars with @xmath115 could grow out of main - sequence seeds embedded in the accretion disk , quickly evolving and then collapsing to intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) .",
    "this scenario is particularly attractive , as it naturally provides a mechanism for making a binary bh with @xmath116 on a circular orbit , surrounded by ample debris that could easily get trapped into resonant orbits .",
    "another mechanism that could explain both the low - mass secondary and also provide a supply of stars would be the tidal disruption of a globular cluster by the primary bh . if the globular cluster hosts an imbh @xcite , it could form a hard binary with the primary , and the surrounding stars could get captured into stable orbits around @xmath0 and @xmath1 . at this point",
    ", it would be impossible to carry out any quantitative analysis of the relative rates and likelihoods of these different scenarios , considering the remarkable lack of observational evidence for even a single smbh binary with orbit smaller than @xmath117 .",
    "rather , we might realistically hope to discover such a system with help from one of the em signatures described below .",
    "tidal disruptions of solar - type stars by smbhs are expected to occur at a rate of @xmath118 yr@xmath5 per mw - type galaxy @xcite , and are excellent tools for detecting otherwise - quiescent nuclei at cosmological distances @xcite .",
    "typical luminosities are comparable to the eddington limit , and the timescale for the rise and subsequent decay of the light curve is on the order of weeks to months @xcite , which is ideal for detection by wide - field time - domain surveys such as pan - starrs or lsst @xcite .",
    "tidal disruptions have recently been proposed as tools for detecting bh mergers or recoiling merger remnants , in some cases long after the merger occurs @xcite .",
    "+    in our scenario , the main - sequence stars are captured into resonant motion around @xmath0 or @xmath1 at large separation ( @xmath119 ) and then move in closer to the primary as the binary separation slowly shrinks .",
    "a star of mass @xmath120 and radius @xmath121 will get disrupted when the tidal forces from the bh are comparable to the star s own self - gravity , which occurs at a distance @xmath122 from the primary : @xmath123 in our numerical tests of section [ numerical_tests ] , we found that during inspiral , some fraction of test particles get ejected from @xmath0 or @xmath1 and disrupted by @xmath11 , the the majority remain bound until the final merger stage . for stars that remain bound to @xmath0 or @xmath1 ,",
    "the gravitational tidal forces are dominated by the primary , and thus the relevant mass in equation ( [ r_td ] ) is @xmath10 .",
    "in figure [ t_td ] we plot the orbital separation of a bh binary as a function of time before merger ( _ black curves _ ) .",
    "the dashed horizontal lines correspond to the points at which ( top - to - bottom ) an o / b star , a solar - type star , or a white dwarf would get tidally disrupted by the primary bh of mass @xmath124 ( _ top _ ) or @xmath125 ( _ bottom _ ) , and secondary mass @xmath84 .",
    "the vertical dotted lines denote where the binary separation reaches the isco and the bhs merge , and the vertical dashed lines correspond to the point where the binary enters the lisa gw frequency band . for @xmath126 ,",
    "a solar - type star would get disrupted roughly a year before merger .",
    "at that point , lisa would already be able to provide an error - box of @xmath127 square degrees for the source location on the sky @xcite , which could be easily monitored for luminous tidal disruption flares out to redshifts @xmath128 or so @xcite . in all cases with @xmath129 , white dwarfs",

    "however , particles ejected at late times when the orbital velocity is highest are also coming from the deepest potentials , so are slowed more as they escape from the system . in practice , we find that net effect is a slight increase in the average escape velocity at late times , but somewhat flatter than the orbital velocity scaling of @xmath131 .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the most efficient three - body slingshot interactions require the test particle to come within a small fraction of @xmath45 from the secondary , and when @xmath45 becomes smaller , these close approaches more likely lead to capture or disruption than ejection .    from equation ( [ r_td ] ) , we see that a solar - type star would get tidally disrupted by a @xmath124 bh at a distance of @xmath132 , far outside the isco . for @xmath133 , however , a star could survive to within @xmath134 of the primary . from that separation",
    ", we find that test particles are ejected with mean velocities of @xmath135 , roughly 50 times greater than the radial velocities of hyper - velocity stars ( hvss ) observed in the outer regions of the milky way @xcite .",
    "of course , any star moving that fast would be observable for a much shorter time ; only a few million years after the bh merger . at the same time",
    ", this allows younger , more massive stars to survive out to the edge of the galaxy , making them even easier to identify against the field stars .",
    "it is conceivable that the bh at the center of our galaxy may have experienced a minor merger with @xmath136 in the past 10 myr , an event which may be convincingly inferred by the detection of such an ultra - hvs at a distance of @xmath137 kpc .      in the event",
    "that many stars are initially trapped around @xmath0 or @xmath1 , the gravitational interactions between the test particles may become important , an effect that we have neglected in this work . especially for larger systems with @xmath138 , one could even imagine forming globular clusters around the lagrange points , although from equation ( [ a_h2 ] ) it is clear they would necessarily be quite compact .",
    "when the core of a normal globular cluster grows too dense , it can undergo a collapse via gravitational instability , at the same time expanding the orbits of the outer stars , due to conservation of energy . in our bh binary system ,",
    "the adiabatic compression of orbits may trigger core collapse of the trapped cluster , while simultaneously preventing any outer stars from escaping , thereby enhancing the stellar density further .",
    "if the density becomes high enough , stellar collisions will become common , and the system could act as a breeding ground for supermassive stars and imbhs @xcite .",
    "many of the formation scenarios considered above naturally lead to high - mass stars forming in the dense gaseous environments around the smbh binary .",
    "these stars could then evolve and collapse into neutron stars or stellar - mass bhs on timescales short compared to the inspiral time . unlike main sequence stars that would get tidally disrupted well before the merger , compact objects would survive unperturbed until they either get ejected or captured whole by one of the bhs . in that case , they would also contribute to the gw signal produced by the binary . for a system with @xmath126 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 , the stellar - mass bh would contribute an additional @xmath141 to the waveform amplitude . at a distance of 1 gpc",
    ", this small perturbation would still be observable with lisa .",
    "however , if the compact object is orbiting exactly at the @xmath0 or @xmath1 with no libration , it would contribute a pure sinusoid component to the waveform with identical frequency as the dominant wave , only with a phase shift of @xmath142 .",
    "thus it would be indistinguishable from a normal binary on a circular orbit with slightly different masses and phase .",
    "on the other hand , if the compact object is librating with typical amplitude @xmath143 , as we might expect in the general case , the waveform will contain a distinct signal at the libration frequency ( in this example , @xmath144 ) which may still be detectable .",
    "more likely , this extra signal would be confused with a spin - orbit or spin - spin precession frequency , effectively degrading the overall confidence in the binary parameter estimation . in some cases ,",
    "the stellar - mass bh might get ejected during inspiral , but with small enough velocity that it does nt escape the system , but rather remains bound on a larger , eccentric orbit even after the two massive bhs merge , ultimately merging much later as an extreme mass - ratio inspiral ( emri ) source .",
    "as mentioned above , the secondary bh and the `` test particle '' can actually have comparable masses and still maintain stability of the lagrange points , as long as @xmath145 .",
    "thus a stable three - body bh system could exist with @xmath146 and @xmath147 , in which case the orbital libration could be seen very clearly in a lisa waveform .",
    "the probability of such a system existing is perhaps not as small as one might think , especially if both imbhs form out of a massive accretion disk , not unlike saturn s moons janus and epimetheus .",
    "indeed , only 15 years ago , the possibility of `` hot jupiters '' with @xmath148 , orbiting very close to their host stars was considered quite remote , and now we know of hundreds of such systems .",
    "the same may very well be true of smbhs and their surrounding gas disks .      in the circumbinary accretion disk model",
    ", ample gas and dust will surround the bh binary , of which some fraction could likely get trapped into orbits around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "if cold enough , this gas could get compressed by the evolving binary potential and form stars or even clusters of stars , as discussed above .",
    "more likely , the gas will be rather hot , with thermal velocities comparable to the libration velocities of test particles filling the stable volume around @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "one very rough estimate of this thermal motion may come from inspection of equation ( [ c_j ] ) and figure [ cj_cont ] .",
    "trapped particles will have @xmath149 , so typical velocities in the rotating frame of @xmath150 @xcite . combining with equation ( [ a_h2 ] ) for the separation at the time of binary formation , we get an initial thermal velocity of @xmath151 or roughly @xmath152 k. somewhat remarkably , @xmath153 is independent of @xmath62 or @xmath10 ( except indirectly through the @xmath154 relationship ) .",
    "we can estimate an upper limit on the density of this gas @xmath155 by requiring it to be stable to gravitational collapse . in other words ,",
    "the total mass should not exceed the jeans mass : @xmath156 with @xmath157 the boltzmann constant and @xmath158 the proton mass .",
    "the leading factor of @xmath159 comes from the volume of the stable region , estimated from figure [ n45_mu ] .",
    "taking @xmath160 , we get @xmath161 corresponding to a total mass in gas of @xmath162 which is far more than enough material to fuel a bright em counterpart .",
    "even if the density of the trapped gas is orders of magnitude smaller , it should still be sufficient to produce observable emission lines if irradiated by an agn or quasar powered by accretion onto one of the bhs . for a cloud of gas filling the stable region around each lagrange point , the covering fraction would be on the order of a few percent .",
    "since the thermal velocity is roughly a factor of 10 smaller than the orbital velocity , the emission lines would be somewhat narrower than a classical broad line originating from the same radius . the coherent shape and motion of the cloud",
    "would also give rise to a large velocity offset relative to the host galaxy or narrow emission line clouds residing at a greater distance from the central engine .",
    "this offset in wavelength would vary periodically with the binary orbit ( @xmath163 at our fiducial value of @xmath164 would be on the order of 10 years ) , giving strong evidence for the existence of a bh binary .",
    "such an effect could be detected by large spectroscopic surveys like the sloan digital sky survey , a technique already in frequent use by observers searching for binary quasars or recoiling black holes @xcite",
    "we have analyzed the circular restricted three - body problem including leading - order terms for gravitational wave losses , in particular studying the behavior of test particle orbits near the stable lagrange points @xmath0 and @xmath1 . we find that these orbit remain stable throughout most of the adiabatic inspiral phase , and their locations shift relative to the newtonian limit as the binary enters the late phases of inspiral and merger .",
    "analogous to the case of inertial drag forces in the planetary problem , the non - conservative gw loss terms lead to an asymmetry between @xmath0 and @xmath1 : test particles around @xmath0 move closer to the secondary bh , while those initially around @xmath1 move away from it . while there appear to",
    "be complicating resonances that affect the relative stability of the two regions differently for different mass ratios , a general trend is that the inclusion of gw losses increases the stability of @xmath1 while decreasing the stability of @xmath0 .",
    "particles initially around @xmath0 are more likely than those around @xmath1 to get captured or disrupted by @xmath11 , while particles near @xmath1 are more likely to get ejected from the system entirely .",
    "however , in both cases , the vast majority of particles get neither ejected nor captured until the binary separation is on the order @xmath165 , at which point the newtonian equations of motion break down entirely and everything plunges into the primary bh .",
    "the stability of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 lagrange points throughout most of the inspiral provides a natural mechanism for shepharding material from relatively large radii down to the central bh , in turn producing a luminous em counterpart to the gw signal from a bh merger .",
    "the detailed physics behind such an em signal are well beyond the scope of this paper , but early results from numerical relativity simulations suggest that bright em flares should be quite general , provided enough gas is available @xcite .",
    "in addition to the prompt emission associated with the final merger , we have shown that hyper - velocity stars with speeds as high as @xmath135 might be observable , flying away from the galactic center for millions of years after the merger . with sufficient column densities of diffuse gas",
    "trapped around @xmath0 and @xmath1 , a precursor signal could take the form of highly red / blue - shifted emission lines , narrower than typical broad lines , with the line offset varying periodically with the bh orbit .    for the majority of the results in this paper , we require that the secondary mass be relatively small : @xmath166 to guarantee linear stability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it is unclear how common bh binaries with such mass ratios might be , and whether they are more likely to form via galactic mergers or _ in situ _",
    ", via the collapse of supermassive stars , accretion from a surrounding disk , or capture from a tidally stripped globular cluster . however , there are other resonances in the restricted three - body problem that may lead to qualitatively similar behavior : the stable transport of matter from large radii down to the isco at the time of merger .",
    "one example from the solar system is the hilda family of asteroids that occupy stable eccentric orbits with periods @xmath167 that of jupiter .",
    "this ensures that they avoid close encounters with jupiter at apocenter , where they spend most of their time . in the corotating frame",
    ", a snapshot of their positions will appear to fill out a triangle with vertices aligned with @xmath33 , @xmath0 , and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that this resonance is stable even in the extreme relativistic limit , but still with small mass ratios ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "our own preliminary results suggest that this @xmath169 resonance is linearly stable for mass ratios at least as large as @xmath170 , but we leave a comprehensive study of the problem , including gw losses , to a future paper .",
    "in addition to all the newtonian resonance behavior present in the three - body problem , the two bhs may also get locked into spin - orbital resonances with each other during inspiral @xcite .",
    "coupled with the non - degenerate orbital frequencies of test particles in a kerr background , the inclusion of spinning bhs would introduce many new degrees of freedom that may affect the stability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . while we do not think additional pn terms in the equations of motion will significantly change our results on a qualitative level , future work that addresses these questions in more detail is certainly warranted .",
