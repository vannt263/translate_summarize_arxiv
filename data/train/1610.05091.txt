    "self - trapping of two - dimensional ( 2d ) localized modes ( spatial solitons ) in nonlinear diffractive media has been one of central topics in nonlinear optics , with many ramifications to other areas @xcite .",
    "belonging to this species of self - trapped modes is the first example of solitons introduced theoretically in nonlinear optics , _",
    "viz_. , the _ townes soliton _ @xcite supported by the cubic ( kerr ) self - focusing nonlinearity .",
    "later , counterparts of the townes soliton with embedded vorticity , i.e. , tubular vortical beams , were theoretically introduced @xcite .",
    "vorticity - carrying hollow beams may find applications as conduits guiding weak optical signals in all - optical data - processing schemes @xcite , as well as tweezers trapping small particles and setting them in rotation @xcite .    unlike 1d solitons , which are usually stable objects @xcite",
    ", stability is a major issue for their 2d counterparts .",
    "the common cubic self - focusing nonlinearity , which easily supports formal 2d solitons solutions , gives rise to the _ critical collapse _",
    "@xcite , which destabilizes the soliton families . for this reason",
    ", the townes soliton has never been observed in the experiment .",
    "multidimensional solitons with embedded vorticity , alias vortex rings , are vulnerable to a still stronger instability initiated by azimuthal perturbations , which splits the ring into fragments @xcite .    thus , the stabilization of multidimensional solitons is an issue of great significance to theoretical studies , and creation of the solitons in the respective physical settings is a challenge to the experiment .",
    "the stabilization of fundamental and vortex solitons by harmonic - oscillator trapping potentials , which do not break the underlying spatial isotropy , has been theoretically elaborated in detail @xcite .",
    "vortex stabilization was shown to be possible with specific nonlinear terms , such as cubic and quintic ones with opposite signs @xcite , or nonlocal nonlinearities @xcite .",
    "their practical implementation requires a careful search for suitable materials , such as liquid cs@xmath0 for the cubic - quintic nonlinearity @xcite , or lead - doped glass for the thermal nonlocal nonlinearity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a recently proposed method applying to binary systems with spin - orbit coupling between the components , provides the stabilization of solitons , combining fundamental and vortical terms in their two components , in both the 2d @xcite and 3d @xcite settings .",
    "a related topic is the stability of fundamental and vortex solitons in dissipative media .",
    "most often , complex ginzburg - landau equations ( cgles ) with the cubic - quintic nonlinearity are used to predict stable dissipative solitons and spiral vortices @xcite .",
    "a different scenario , closely connected to the phenomenon of filamentation , was considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , which addressed the stationary propagation of nonlinear bessel beams in media combining self - focusing kerr nonlinearity and nonlinear dissipative terms accounting for multiphoton absorption ( mpa ) .",
    "the occurrence of mpa of different orders in usual dielectric media , such as silica , water , or air , is a well - established fact .",
    "mpa is a collapse - arresting mechanism , which is an essential ingredient in the filamentation induced by powerful ultrashort pulses @xcite .",
    "being weakly localized , these nonlinear beams carry an unlimited amount of power , playing the role of the intrinsic reservoir which supports an inward - directed radial power flux balancing the nonlinear absorption around the beam s center .",
    "a drastic difference from the cgle - based models is that the propagation of these bessel - like beams in media with nonlinear losses may persist without any gain . of course , in a real experiment the power stored in any beam is finite , but the propagation distance needed for its depletion may easily exceed the length of the experimental sample , thus making the model quite realistic .",
    "nonlinear bessel beams play a crucial role in various experiments @xcite , including filamentation with ultrashort pulsed bessel beams @xcite , where their nonlinear counterparts act as stable or chaotic attractors @xcite .",
    "a qualitatively similar situation was demonstrated in an experiment with influx of atoms into a dissipative sink embedded into a quasi - infinite reservoir @xcite .",
    "more recently , vorticity - carrying nonlinear bessel modes , alias bessel vortex beams ( bvbs ) , with a hollow transverse structure , were introduced theoretically @xcite . similarly to the fundamental nonlinear bessel beam @xcite , and also to nonlinear airy beams @xcite , stationarity is supported by an inward - directed power flux balancing the losses .",
    "subsequently , bvbs were realized experimentally in glass , and employed for laser - powered material processing @xcite .",
    "depending on the input power and geometry , different propagation regimes featuring tubular , rotating and non - rotating speckle - like filaments were observed within the limits of the so - called bessel distance associated to the depletion of the reservoir @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we first show that bvbs may be _ completely stable _ against the azimuthal breakup and collapse alike , in the medium combining the focusing kerr nonlinearity and mpa .",
    "the stability , which is actually imposed by the mpa effect , is predicted by the analysis of the linearized equations for small perturbations , and verified in direct numerical simulations .",
    "the stabilizing effect of nonlinear absorption is known in other contexts , such as the stabilization against radial and temporal perturbations of zero - vorticity beams @xcite and light bullets @xcite , but not against the azimuthal breaking , to which nonlinear vortex beams are vulnerable .",
    "we focus on the ubiquitous cubic self - focusing , which , by itself , can not support any stable 2d patterns .",
    "similar results can be readily obtained for more general nonlinearities , since the existence of the bvbs does not critically depend on the precise nonlinearities , such as the order of mpa , or the precise from of the kerr nonlinearity ( cubic , cubic - quintic  ) @xcite .",
    "thus , we predict that stable bvbs can be created in almost any transparent dielectric at high enough intensities .    in the light of the linear - stability analysis ,",
    "we perform diagnostic numerical simulations of axicon - generated vortex bessel beams propagating in nonlinear media , that allows us to propose a common explanation of the three observed dynamical regimes @xcite . in all the three cases ,",
    "there exist a bvbs that determines the dynamics in the bessel zone after the axicon .",
    "this bvb is specified unambiguously as one preserving three characteristics of the linear bessel beam that would be formed about the middle of the bessel zone in linear propagation , namely , the cone angle , the topological charge , and the inward radial power flux .",
    "the dynamics observed in the bessel zone corresponds to that expected from the development of instability , if any , of that bvb .",
    "if this bvb is stable ( according to the linear - stability analysis ) , or its instability is weak to develop over the bessel distance , the tubular regime is observed in the bessel zone ; otherwise , the azimuthal symmetry breaking in the development of instability , leading either to a rotatory or to a speckle - like filament regime , is observed in the bessel zone .",

    "three representative examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , and further details are reported in the supplement material @xcite .",
    "the three illuminating gaussian beams , with embedded single vortex @xmath49 , @xmath147 , and @xmath148 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( center ) and @xmath150 ( right ) , would yield linear - bessel amplitudes @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively , in linear propagation .",
    "these values have been chosen such that , in media with @xmath30 and @xmath153 and @xmath154 , the nonlinear bvbs with @xmath145 all three have @xmath51 , as in fig . [ fig2](a ) and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . according to these figures ,",
    "the bvb with @xmath134 is stable , while ones with @xmath155 and @xmath154 are unstable . in the two latter cases ,",
    "the inverse growth rates , or characteristic length of development of the instability , are much shorter than the length of the bessel zone , @xmath156 . in the case of the stability ( left panels in fig . [ fig6 ] and more details in supplement @xcite ) , the bvb with @xmath51 and @xmath157 is smoothly formed at the axicon focus , corresponding to distance @xmath158 , which is followed by its smooth decay . in the unstable cases ( central and right panels in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , see additional details in the supplement @xcite ) , the dynamics within the bessel distance reproduces that of the development of the instability leading to the azimuthal breakup , starting from the small - perturbation regime predicted by the linear - stability analysis in fig . [ fig2](a ) and proceeding to the large - perturbation regime displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at @xmath155 , a rotatory regime with one spot , further breaking into two ,",
    "is observed , as also seen in figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . at @xmath159 ,",
    "the instability is stronger , and the two rotating fragments quickly convert themselves into randomly placed non - rotating spots , as seen in figs . [ fig4](c ) and ( d ) .    these three situations closely resemble the quasi - stationary and rotary regimes described numerically in ref .",
    "@xcite , and the quasi - stationary , rotary and speckle - like regimes observed experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite . in those works , the regime which is associated with the formation of a bvb",
    "is supposed to correspond to a stable bvb , and in ref .",
    "@xcite the rotary regime is conjectured to be associated with either an unstable bvb or nonexistence of a bvb in the specific experimental configuration . in neither case",
    "the respective bvb was identified , therefore its stability can not be studied to verify these conjectures .",
    "the above - mentioned representative examples , in the light of the linear - stability analysis , reveal that all the three regimes admit a common explanation in terms of the stability / instability of a specific nonlinear bvb , which is identified as one preserving the cone angle and topological charge , and amplitude @xmath48 such that @xmath145 . since for the linear bessel beam @xmath160 , relation @xmath145 states that the amplitude of the inward hnkel component is a third preserved quantity in the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "we also note from ref .",
    "@xcite that , for given @xmath12 , @xmath36 and @xmath47 , @xmath71 is a strictly growing function of @xmath48 , from @xmath161 at low @xmath48 up to @xmath162 for @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "thus , there always exists a single nonlinear bvb satisfying condition @xmath145 .",
    "for example , in the experimental observation of the quasi - stationary , rotating and speckle - like regimes reported in fig . 4 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the material constants , cone angle and three pulse energies allows us to identify the three bvbs as those defined by @xmath163 , @xmath131 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "the stability analysis gives the respective largest dimensionless growth rates @xmath167 , @xmath168 and @xmath169 , or , multiplying by @xmath170 , the growth rates @xmath171 , @xmath172 and @xmath173 @xmath174 in physical units . comparing the associated characteristic lengths of the instability development , @xmath175 , @xmath176 , @xmath177 cm , with the length @xmath178 cm of the bessel zone explains the nonoccurrence of the azimuthal breakup as lack of development of the bvb instability in the first case , the rotating filaments in the second case as a primary manifestation of the breakup of the bvb , and the random filaments in the third case as full development of the instability .",
    "finally , the existence of truly stable nonlinear bvbs implies that a tubular - beam propagation regime for beams passing the axicon exists , being limited solely by the finite amount of power stored in the reservoir , the depletion of which defines the edge of the bessel zone .",
    "thus , the stable vortex tubules may be extended indefinitely long by increasing the power stock ( e.g. , by dint of the increase of @xmath179 ) .",
    ", at the indicated propagation distances for @xmath63 ( left ) , @xmath125 ( center ) , and @xmath128 ( right ) , in the presence of the four - photon absorption , produced by axicons illuminated by vortex - carrying gaussian beams with @xmath180 and @xmath49 , but different amplitudes : @xmath148 ( left ) , @xmath149 ( center ) and @xmath150 ( right ) , yielding bessel amplitudes @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively .",
    "the three nonlinear bvbs with @xmath49 and @xmath71 matching these values of @xmath181 in samples with the corresponding values of @xmath61 and @xmath12 , have the same parameter @xmath101 , which can be identified using the method of ref .",
    "we have proposed a new setting for the stabilization of localized vortex beams in self - focusing kerr media .",
    "the inclusion of the nonlinear dissipative term accounting for the mpa ( multiphoton absorption ) makes the nonlinear bessel vortex beams stable . as described earlier for the zero - vorticity situation @xcite , for airy beams @xcite , and , recently , for nonlinear bessel vortex beams @xcite , the concomitant mpa - induced power loss is balanced by the radial flux from their intrinsic reservoir .",
    "stability regions for the nonlinear bessel vortex beams have been predicted by the linear - stability analysis and corroborated by direct simulations .",
    "stable states with multiple vorticities have been found too .",
    "differently from preceding works , these stable vortices do not require materials with  tailored \" nonlinearities .",
    "they may be common dielectrics , such as air , water or standard optical glasses , all featuring the ubiquitous kerr nonlinearity and mpa ( multiphoton absorption ) at sufficiently high intensities ( tens of tw/@xmath55 in gases , or a fraction of tw/@xmath55 in condensed matter ) .",
    "this is probably the reason why , on the contrary to previous proposals , the practical implementation of bvbs ( bessel vortex beams ) precedes the demonstration of their stability .",
    "axicon - generated bvbs with finite power were observed in @xcite to propagate steadily within the bessel zone .",
    "the proof of the stability has important consequences for these experiments and subsequent applications .",
    "the stability implies , for example , that the steady regime can be extended indefinitely long by simply enlarging the bessel zone .",
    "the stability analysis and diagnostic numerical simulations also allow us to interpret the two other propagation regimes observed in these experiments .",
    "we have concluded that the nonlinear dynamics is always governed by a specific nonlinear bvb , which we have fully specified .",
    "the quasi - stationary regime in the bessel zone is observed when this nonlinear bvb is found to be stable in our linear - stability analysis , or is effectively stable over the finite length of the bessel zone .",
    "the rotary and speckle - like regimes are observed when this nonlinear bvb is found to be unstable , and the instability can develop , depending on its growth rate and the length of the bessel zone .",
    "the azimuthal - symmetry - breaking dynamics in the bessel zone is just a manifestation of the evolution of the unstable bvb .    as an extension of this analysis ,",
    "it may be of interest to study the interaction between spatially separated stable vortices in the same model , as well as the stability of the tubular vortices against spatiotemporal ( longitudinal ) perturbations .",
