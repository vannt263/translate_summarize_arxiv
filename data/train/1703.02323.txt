    "since nearly all experimental results in particle physics uphold the standard model of particle physics , new phenomena indicating the existence of physics beyond the model remain in demand . among such phenomena , a large @xmath4- or @xmath0-violation that could explain considerable matter - antimatter asymmetry observed in our universe might exist . in response , we tested time - reversal symmetry in nuclear @xmath1 decay in search of a large @xmath0-violation beyond the standard model .    in nuclear @xmath1 decay ,",
    "a parity - violating phenomenon is known as a correlation between nuclear spin and electron momentum , defined as @xmath5 correlation in decay rate function , @xmath6 ; @xmath7 in which , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the energy , momentum , and spin of the electron ( neutrino ) , respectively @xcite , and @xmath11 is the parent nuclear spin polarization",
    ".    however , two other correlations also violate time - reversal symmetry .",
    "the first , @xmath12 correlation is a triple vector correlation of nuclear spin polarization , electron momentum , and neutrino momentum , that does not violate parity symmetry .",
    "the other correlation , the @xmath3 correlation , among nuclear spin polarization , electron momentum , and its spin also violates parity symmetry . as such , the study of @xmath3 correlation initially seems to compete with studies of electric dipole moments ( edm ) , and indeed , search sensitivities of new theoretical models are discussed that compare @xmath3 , @xmath12 and edm @xcite .",
    "for example , in an r - parity violating susy model , the @xmath3 correlation can be large without conflicting with edms because the coupling dependence of the correlation differs from that of edms@xcite . in that sense",
    ", @xmath3 correlation studies may not compete with edm studies , but complement them instead .",
    "regarding the @xmath3 correlation , a neutron experiment yielding @xmath13  @xcite , a @xmath2experiment yielding @xmath14  @xcite , a @xmath15 experiment yielding @xmath16  @xcite , and other measurements @xcite with low precision have all been reported , each with results consistent with time - reversal symmetry .",
    "we therefore aimed to establish a new technical approach for a new @xmath17 measurement to be performed at triumf - isac , with a sensitivity expected to approach a precision of @xmath18 on @xmath3 .",
    "two key beam parameters to perform a high precision the @xmath3 measurement are , 1 . a high intensity beam which leads a high statistical precision , and 2 . a high beam polarization which enables us to reach high experimental sensitivity",
    "at triumf , a 70% polarized @xmath19 pps @xmath2beam is available , which is enabled by laser optical pumping technique @xcite . at triumf",
    ", we expect to perform a test at a precision approximate to the predicted final state interaction level @xcite . with that motivation , we performed a pilot experiment at kek - triac @xcite , for which an 8% polarized @xmath20 pps @xmath2beam was made available for related demonstration measurements  @xcite .",
    "a tilted foil technique was used at triac , which can produce relatively low beam polarization comparing to the optical pumping technique .",
    "we measured the transverse polarization of electrons emitted in polarized @xmath2@xmath1 decay as left - right scattering asymmetry in backward mott scattering using thin metal foil .",
    "mott scattering has an analyzing power on electrons transverse polarization @xcite that has a maximum figure of merit at a backward scattering angle .",
    "another @xmath2measurement at the paul scherrer institute was performed with the same mott polarimetry using a plastic scintillation counter array  @xcite . by extension",
    ", we developed a new tracking detector system designed to perform a new mott polarimetry in order to improve event - detecting reliability and suppress systematic effects in simple counter measurements .",
    "inspired by a neutron experiment  @xcite performed using an electron - tracking detector , as in our approach , for free neutrons , we also measured the mott scattering of electrons emitted from stopped @xmath2nuclei on a beam stopper by using the tracking detector for the first time .",
    "we performed our experiment during 3 days at kek - triac . after the jaea tandem accelerator irradiated a 68-mev @xmath21 beam onto a 99% enriched @xmath22 graphite disk production target , @xmath2was produced via a @xmath23 reaction and separated from the primary beam by jaea - isol  @xcite . by following a tilted foil method @xcite , we then vertically polarized the @xmath2beam , which we stopped at a platinum foil stopper to which magnetic holding fields",
    "were applied using permanent magnets .",
    "since the beam was diffused via multiple scattering in the tilted foils before entering the stopper , we used an annealed platinum stopper 20  @xmath24 m thick and sized 6 @xmath25 7.5  cm to receive the scattered beam .",
    "the typical intensity of the @xmath2beam was @xmath20  pps .",
    "we measured @xmath2beam polarization as @xmath26 , which yielded an @xmath2sample polarization of @xmath27 after spin relaxation in the stopper material @xcite . to cancel the detector s efficiency difference for left- and rightward mott scattering , we flipped the direction of the nuclear polarization every 5 min .",
    "we performed beam spin flipping by rotating the tilting foils in the reverse direction , which took 20  s. we next set the measuring time window to be 300  s. table  [ tab_8lipara ] presents the beam parameters .",

    "we used an effective analyzing power , @xmath74 , after integrating the electron energy dependence , thereby correcting for the foil thickness effect due to depolarization inside the lead foil @xcite and correcting the tilting effect of the mott scattering plane .",
    "the @xmath35-dependent shape of @xmath74 was also corrected in consideration of the angular resolution of the mwdc , which was approximately @xmath75 .",

    "the energy threshold of the counters corresponded to the minimum electron energy of @xmath82  mev before losing its energy inside the materials .",

    "_ beam polarization tilting .",

    "we estimated the @xmath84 parameter in the standard model as @xmath89 when we assumed an average electron energy of 4  mev from @xmath2decay .",
    "we estimated tilting angle @xmath85 with an alignment error of @xmath90 , in which the mounting precision of the tilted foil of @xmath91 represented the dominant uncertainty .",
    "the estimated systematic error on @xmath3 due to @xmath84 correlation was @xmath92 .    _",
    "@xmath1-decay asymmetry .",
    "_ if efficiency was not perfectly stable , but correlated with radiation intensity , then a fake asymmetry was observable without real @xmath3 correlation due to the anisotropic change in electron flux , which was due to the parity violating @xmath1 asymmetry . moreover , accidental coincidence between two different event tracks that were wrongly recognized as v track events may generate additional fake asymmetry .",
    "such systematic effects can not be negated by beam spin flipping .",
    "we studied this fake asymmetry effect in another experiment at triumf - isac as mtv run - ii  @xcite . by extrapolating from the nuclear polarization of 58% at triumf and 5% at triac",
