    ", research has focused on generalizations of leaf powers @xcite , which also turned into dead ends , very soon .    on the other hand ,",
    "if we push @xmath1 to infinity , then it turns out that not every graph is a @xmath1-leaf power for some @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , a @xmath1-leaf power is , by definition , the subgraph of the @xmath1-th power of a tree @xmath3 induced by the leaves of @xmath3 .",
    "since trees are sun - free chordal and as taking powers and induced subgraphs do not destroy this property , it follows trivially that every @xmath1-leaf power , despite the value of @xmath1 , is strongly chordal @xcite .",
    "but even not every strongly chordal graph is a @xmath1-leaf power for some @xmath17 .",

    "recently , we introduced the clique arrangement in @xcite , a new data structure that is especially valuable for the analysis of strongly chordal graphs .",
    "the clique arrangement @xmath24 of a chordal graph @xmath14 is a directed acyclic graph that has certain vertex subsets of @xmath14 as a node set and describes the mutual inclusion of these sets by arcs . in particular , for every set @xmath25 of maximal cliques of @xmath14 there is a node in @xmath26 for @xmath27 and two nodes @xmath28 are joined by an arc @xmath29 , if @xmath30 and there is no @xmath31 with @xmath32 . in @xcite , we give a new characterization of strongly chordal graphs in terms of a forbidden cyclic substructure in the clique arrangement , called bad @xmath1-cycles for @xmath33 , and we show how to construct the clique arrangement of a strongly chordal graph in nearly linear time .    it is known that the clique arrangements of ptolemaic graphs are even directed trees @xcite . since all ptolemaic graphs are leaf powers and all leaf powers are strongly chordal , it appears likely that the degree of acyclicity in clique arrangements of leaf powers is between forbidden bad @xmath1-cycles , @xmath34 , and the complete absence of cycles .",
    "this paper describes a cyclic substructure that is forbidden in the clique arrangement of leaf powers . for convenience , we call these substructures bad @xmath8-cycles , although they are not the obvious continuation of the concept of bad @xmath1-cycles for @xmath34 . as the main result of this paper ,",
    "we show that bad @xmath8-cycles occur in @xmath13 , if and only if @xmath14 contains at least one of seven induced subgraphs @xmath35 depicted in figure [ fig : counterexamples ] .    we leave it as an open question , if these seven graphs are sufficient to characterize @xmath16 in terms of forbidden subgraphs . however , we conjecture that this is the case",
    ". this would imply a polynomial time recognition algorithm for @xmath16 , by using the possibility of efficiently recognizing strongly chordal graphs and checking the containment of a finite number of forbidden induced subgraphs .",
