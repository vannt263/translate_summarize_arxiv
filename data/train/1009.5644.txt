    "the launch of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ ushered a new era in x - ray astronomy of agn outflows with the discovery of absorption lines in the spectra that enabled for the first time accurate charge state and velocity measurements .",
    "the long observations of a number of agns revealed transitions of charge states as diverse as  through . since any atomic gas with bound electrons absorbs x - rays these ions span a range of @xmath10 in ionization parameter @xmath11 , a fact that underscores the great utility of x - ray spectroscopy . in a subsequent development , @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , b09 ) developed a statistical measure of the plethora of the transitions in the _ chandra / xmm _ spectra , the absorption measure distribution ( amd ) , namely the differential hydrogen - equivalent column @xmath12 of specific ions per decade of @xmath11 , i.e. amd @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the amd was found to be roughly constant , i.e. @xmath14 to be roughly independent of @xmath11 , in the small number of seyferts for which the data quality allowed a quantitative analysis .",
    "the functional form of the amd is significant as it can provide the plasma density along the observer s line of sight ( los ) , which for constant amd is @xmath15 .",
    "motivated by the amd systematics , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , fkcb ) employed the photoionization code ` xstar ` @xcite to determine the ionization structure of the 2d winds of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , cl94 ) which provide for density profiles such as @xmath16 .",
    "this density dependence on @xmath17 yields also @xmath18 , thereby allowing for ionic species of decreasing ionization with distance , but of columns similar to those of high ionization .",
    "importantly , these models are scale free : with the radial coordinate @xmath17 normalized to the radius , @xmath19 , and the mass flux to the eddington rate , @xmath11 is independent of the black hole mass @xmath20 , implying broad applicability in galactic and extragalactic settings .",
    "assuming an ionizing spectral energy density ( sed ) of @xmath21 between 1 and 1000 ryd , these models were successful in reproducing the observed : ( i ) slow velocities ( @xmath22 km  s@xmath23 ) for the low ionization transitions like  and fast outflows ( @xmath24 km  s@xmath23 ) for the high ionization ones such as , and ( ii ) amd almost independent of @xmath11 for @xmath25 , in agreement with the results of b09 .    while x - ray absorption lines in seyfert spectra are rather recent discoveries , uv absorption lines in seyferts and qsos have been known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also known since the earlier _ rosat _ surveys ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is that the x - ray - to - uv flux ratio of the broad absorption line ( bal ) qsos [ i.e. qsos with blue absorption  and ly@xmath26 troughs of @xmath27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] is smaller than that of the qso majority , possibly due to absorption of the x - rays by the bal plasma .",
    "indeed , this was confirmed by the _",
    "asca _ detection of high x - ray absorption column @xmath28 @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "* hereafter , g06 ) later conducted a _",
    "chandra _ survey combined with known uv absorption properties that supported the earlier claims .",
    "chandra _ data of bal qsos indicate that @xmath29 ( g06 ) is smaller than the mean qso value @xmath30 .",
    "this result is augmented by a correlation between @xmath9 and the @xmath31 kev x - ray photon index @xmath32 : increased photoelectric absorption of soft x - rays ( i.e. smaller @xmath33 also yields a smaller effective @xmath32 , as observed .",
    "the high outflow velocities of the prominent uv resonance lines (  and ly@xmath26 ) in bal qsos were traditionally ascribed to radiation - driven winds @xcite , in analogy with the winds of o stars @xcite and were modeled as such ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , mcgv ) .",
    "mcgv recognized and included heuristically the effects of wind ionization and its shielding from the qso x - rays , a crucial process as ionization reduces severely the effectiveness of line driving .",
    "* hereafter , psk ) presented 2d hydrodynamic simulations of these winds , including x - ray ionization , showing that the required shielding is provided by the section of the wind closest to the x - ray source that  failed \" to launch by being too highly ionized , thereby allowing exterior segments to achieve velocities in agreement with  observations .",
    "however , recent x - ray observations of bal qsos revealed absorption features in their spectra identified with highly ionized /  of column density @xmath6 @xmath7 , blueshifted to high velocities @xmath34 ( e.g. apm  08279 + 5255 , pg  1115 + 080 and h  1413 + 117 ) indicating that x - ray ionization does not necessarily inhibit outflows , which can occur at velocities even higher than those seen in the uv lines ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite , hereafter , c09 ) .",
    "additional x - ray studies have revealed a number of non - bal qsos that also exhibit similar x - ray absorbers at high velocities @xmath35 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , while in apm  08279 + 5255 c09 have also noted a correlation between @xmath32 and the velocity of .",
    "motivated by these observations , we examine in this letter the conditions under which the magnetically - driven winds discussed in fkcb can reproduce the observed velocities of the bal qso x - ray features ( ) _ along with _ those of their more common uv transitions ( ) . in  2 we summarize the physics of mhd accretion disk winds and the differences of the ionization properties between seyferts and bal qsos . in ",
    "3 we present our results and demonstrate a number of well - defined correlations among their kinematics , column , spectral index , and los angle and we conclude with a summary and discussion in  4 .",
    "in this section we present a brief outline of the mhd winds , originally formulated by blandford & payne ( 1982 ) and generalized by cl94 to include arbitrary distribution of axial current with radius . here and in fkcb",
    "we focus on the current distribution that produces a density profile @xmath15 , crucial for obtaining the observed amd behavior .",
    "the same distribution leads also to a toroidal field @xmath36 that has equal magnetic energy per decade of ( cylindrical ) radius .",
    "self - similarity is assumed , i.e. power - law radial dependence for all variables and solution of the remaining angular part of these equations . as discussed in fkcb ,",
    "this assumption is not very restrictive and justified _ a posteriori _ by the large number of decades of @xmath11 in the amd form .",
    "the fundamental quantity of axisymmetric mhd is the magnetic stream function @xmath37 , assumed to have the form @xmath38 , with @xmath39 the poloidal magnetic flux through the fiducial wind launch radius at @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is its angular dependence to be solved for and @xmath42 a free parameter that determines the radial dependence of the poloidal current .",
    "the scalings of the poloidal magnetic stream function carry over to the rest of the wind properties of which we show only the magnetic field , velocity and density ( see fkcb ) : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the proton mass .",
    "the dimensionless angular functions denoted by _",
    "tilde _ must be obtained from the conservation equations and the solution of the grad - shafranov equation with initial values on the disk ( denoted by the subscript  o \" ) at ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the density normalization at ( @xmath46 ) , setting @xmath47 , is given in terms of dimensionless mass - accretion rate @xmath48 ( see fkcb ) by @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ratio of the mass - outflow rate in the wind to @xmath48 , assumed here to be of order unity and @xmath51 is the thomson cross - section .",
    "it is important to note that because the mass flux in these winds depends in general on the radius , @xmath52 always refers to the mass flux at the innermost flow radius at @xmath53 where @xmath19 is the radius . in the present treatment",
    "we adopt the value @xmath54 resulting in @xmath55 , the steepest density dependence on @xmath17 implied by the agn amd data of b09 , and in order to allow for the somewhat higher observed x - ray column than uv column .    with the dimensionless , mass - invariant wind structure",

    "1a ) for given @xmath52 and @xmath56 , the only significant difference in the wind ionization properties across objects of different luminosity is the spectral distribution of ionizing radiation . while in fkcb we used a spectrum of the form @xmath21 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , more appropriate for seyferts , here we add a bright uv disk source .",
    "the spectrum used in the present work is shown in figure  1b ; it comprises a multicolor - disk ( mcd ) with an innermost temperature of 5 ev and an x - ray power - law ( pl ) of photon index @xmath32 normalized by @xmath9 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we do not include a soft x - ray excess in the sed , a feature more appropriate for narrow - line seyfert spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the pl has a low energy cut - off at 5 ev and a high energy one at 200 kev .",
    "the total ( x - ray plus uv ) luminosity is @xmath57 erg  s@xmath23 .",

    "with the background flow ( @xmath59 ) and the spectrum of the ionizing radiation ( @xmath60 ) given , we follow the same procedure as in fkcb : we split the wind logarithmically into a number of radial zones ; we employ ` xstar ` to compute the ionization and opacities / emissivity in each zone along an observer s los .    in figure  [",
    "fig : fig2 ] we show the resulting distribution of the hydrogen - equivalent column densities @xmath61 of iron and carbon for @xmath62 as a function of @xmath11 ( optimized here to model the outflows in apm  08279 + 5255 ) along with the corresponding los velocity ( _ dashed _ curve ) , to be read on the right vertical axis . note the well - defined velocity gradient of the wind with ionization parameter @xmath11 due to its continuous structure .",
    "the  ions identified through their resonance transitions of 1s-2p/3p obtain their peak hydrogen - equivalent columns of @xmath12 ( ) @xmath63 @xmath7 at @xmath64 with velocities @xmath65 . on the other hand ,",
    "the ions ( 2s-2p transitions ) yield @xmath12 ( ) @xmath66 @xmath7 with corresponding los velocities @xmath67 , roughly consistent with the uv / x - ray absorbers in apm  08279 + 0255 data ( c09 ) .",
    "the obtained ionization structure directly reflects the spatial positions of these ions ; i.e. @xmath17()/@xmath19 @xmath68 and @xmath17()/@xmath19 @xmath69 for @xmath62 ( see fig.1a ) assuming a single los .",
    "note that the equivalent width ( ew ) of the modeled  absorption seems also to be fairly large due to a wide spread of its peak column distribution ( i.e. @xmath70 ) equivalent to @xmath71 km  s@xmath23 in agreement with the typical width of  bals ( i.e. @xmath72 km  s@xmath23 ) .",

    "this can be traced to the different @xmath52 and/or ionizing spectrum @xmath79 .",
    "indeed @xmath52 here is @xmath80 times higher than that in fkcb , leading to a large increase in @xmath12 ; furthermore , @xmath9 is smaller here than in fkcb , with the present value @xmath81 consistent with the values of uv - luminous qsos @xcite .",
    "these differences affect the  and  velocities as follows : the combined increase in @xmath52 and decrease in @xmath9 imply lower ionization of the plasma at the smallest @xmath17 , despite the fact that the ratio @xmath82 does not change ; this is because the luminosity @xmath83 in the definition of @xmath11 involves an integral over the spectrum , while the ionization of the gas is affected mostly by the 2 - 10 kev x - rays .",
    "therefore , an increase in @xmath52 for a given @xmath20 achieves : ( i ) an increase in the plasma column , density and luminosity and ( ii ) a relative decrease of the ionizing hard x - ray flux ( smaller @xmath0 ) . with these changes over fkcb , in the present treatment iron",
    "is not fully ionized even at the smallest radii ( @xmath84 ) , leading to @xmath2 ( ) @xmath85 .",
    "this partial ionization of the plasma , coupled with the increased column , reduces the ionizing flux that reaches further out into the wind , especially for high @xmath56 , leading to a bootstrap of less ionization and increasingly higher soft x - ray opacity . then , because of the ensuing severe reduction of ionizing photons in the @xmath86 kev range , the  ions form at smaller radii ( higher velocities ) , so that the @xmath87 increase of the photon flux with @xmath88 ev ( the ionization potential of ) off - sets the photon depletion due to photoelectric absorption by the partially ionized plasma .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies of bal qsos have indicated likely correlations between the maximum outflow velocity of the uv / x - ray absorbers and the spectral indices ( g06;c09 ) . for comparison",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : fig3]a the modeled outflow velocities for  and  with different values of ( @xmath89 ) for @xmath90 and @xmath62 .",
    "it is seen for @xmath91 that  velocities correlate strongly with @xmath32 ( _ solid _ curves ) allowing for velocities in the range @xmath92 consistent with the x - ray outflow velocity observations in apm  08279 + 5255 ( c09 ) , while the  velocity is virtually unaffected .",
    "this is because for the steeper x - ray spectra fewer ionizing photons are available to produce highly - ionized species ( e.g.  of ionization potential @xmath93 kev ) and the relevant ions are found at smaller distances ( higher velocities ) than in the case of harder spectra .",
    "this does not affect significantly the overall ionization of the wind leaving the  transition at roughly the same distance .",
    "however , a change in @xmath9 , affects strongly the maximum column position of both  and , as described above . for constant @xmath94 ,",
    "the velocities of both these transitions correlate strongly with @xmath9 ( _ dashed _ curves ) , ranging between @xmath95()/c @xmath96 and @xmath97()/c @xmath98 for @xmath99 qualitatively consistent with uv data ( @xcite ; g06 ; @xcite ) .",
    "radiation forces are often invoked to explain these correlations ( with x - ray shielding necessary for high velocities , e.g. mcgv;psk ) .",
    "in contrast to these models , _ high - velocity flows are always present in our model _ , but only the steep @xmath100 allows the relevant ions ( e.g. ,  and ) to form in their _",
    "small-@xmath17 , high-@xmath2 regions _ which are otherwise overionized ( c.f .",
    "fkcb ) . while some ( narrow - line ) seyferts with @xmath101 appear to exhibit x - ray outflows with @xmath102 @xcite , these are systematically slower [ and generally substantially slower @xcite ] than those of the bal qsos with @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we propose @xmath9 as the defining parameter that determines the velocities of the uv / x - ray absorption features in agns .",
    "while the intrinsic mhd wind ionization structure is determined by @xmath9 , the observables , i.e. the velocity widths / shifts of the ions depend strongly also on the observers inclination angle @xmath56 . in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3]b we present the los velocity of the  and  transitions for various @xmath56 with @xmath104 . because of the specific geometric shape of the magnetic field lines and ionization equilibria , characteristic ion velocities vary for different los angles [ see also fig .",
    "1a for their positional transitions along various los from @xmath105 ( innermost ) to @xmath106 ( outermost ) ] . in this fiducial model",
    "we find that @xmath107 at @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( ) @xmath110 at @xmath111 . at larger angles the velocities decrease but the integrated columns are so high that it is doubtful these features are observable .",
    "similar diagrams can be computed for different values of the parameters ( @xmath112 ) and can be directly compared to observations to assess the fundamental assumptions of these models .",
    "we have demonstrated that purely mhd disk - winds with @xmath113 , originally proposed to account for the x - ray amds in seyferts , can also encompass combined _ high - velocity uv / x - ray absorber properties _ as diverse as those of bal qsos , with those of apm  08279 + 5255 as a template .",
    "this is extremely important in view of the winds scale invariance , with the qualitative differences in the absorber properties between seyferts and qsos attributed mainly to their different @xmath52 and @xmath9 .",
    "given the well documented correlation of agn uv - luminosity ( a proxy for @xmath52 ) with @xmath9 @xcite , this model implies agn absorber structure that depends essentially on a _ single _",
    "parameter @xmath9 . however , the observables , e.g. , columns and velocities , depend additionally on the los angle @xmath56 , reproducing the qso bals  ( uv ) and  ( x - ray ) properties only for sufficiently large @xmath56 , as usually considered .",
    "our calculations show that  forms at @xmath114 with corresponding velocity @xmath2 ( ) @xmath115 .",
    "this value , along with the  velocity @xmath2 ( ) @xmath116 at @xmath117 , are consistent with those observed in apm  08279 + 5255 ( c09 ) .",
    "the shielding of the plasma from the x - rays at @xmath118 , necessary to produce the high velocity  absorption in radiation - driven wind models ( mcgv;psk ) , is in our case naturally provided by the _",
    "faster components of the same wind launched from even smaller radii_. ionization equilibrium as a result of steeper @xmath9 allows the relevant charge states to form closer to the central engines where the wind is faster .    for simplicity ,",
    "we have ignored here a number of physical processes , e.g. radiation pressure ( see psk ) and thermal instability @xcite , likely to have an impact on our mhd - wind properties , that need to be implemented ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the broader validity of our models , gauged by the amd dependence on @xmath11 , will be decided by observations and quantitative analysis such as those presented in b09 .",
    "it is also encouraging that the ionization properties of certain x - ray absorbers are consistent with this picture and , in fact , magnetic - driving of disk - winds has been favorably argued for gro  j1655 - 40 ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and ngc  4151 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for example .",
    "we anticipate the upcoming _ astro - h _ mission to contribute significantly to this goal by providing more detail on the fe - k component of the wind , and thus to further clarify our picture of agn structure .",
