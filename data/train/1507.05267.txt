    "fits to dis structure function data  @xcite based on the high - energy tmd factorization  @xcite or on other approaches ( e.g. saturation formalism ) to high - energy dis , in some cases including the precision measurements  @xcite and tmd pdf uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "* fits to spin and azimuthal asymmetries data from low - energy experiments either based on parton model  @xcite or including qcd evolution  @xcite .    for precision phenomenology it will be essential that results of fits and parameterizations are given in a portable form as a determination of tmd pdfs over a given kinematic range , appropriate to the theoretical method and experimental data used",
    "a first step in this direction has been taken in  @xcite .",
    "the main point is that if results of fits to experimental data are used to provide tmd pdfs at different evolution scales , theoretical predictions for physical cross sections could then be obtained by using these pdfs in factorization formulas ( or , eventually , in monte carlo event generators implementing these formulas ) . in",
    "@xcite a library has been initiated , , in order to unify and simplify the access of tmds , along with a plotting tool , , for easier comparisons .",
    "commonly used pdf sets are implemented in , with the goal to provide a library of all available tmds . in   pdfs",
    "are accessible in an easily callable way within the range of their applicability .",
    "the pdfs currently included range from tmd gluon densities obtained from fits to small-@xmath13 dis data based on high - energy factorization , to tmd gluon densities from fits based on saturation approaches , to tmd quark densities from parton - model fits to low - energy fixed - target data at large @xmath13 and small @xmath44 .",
    "tmd fragmentation functions are not yet implemented , but are foreseen for the future .",
    "an example from  is shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : tmdplotter - glue ] we show results for gluon distributions  @xcite .",
    "the nonperturbative parameters of the distribution represented by the red curve are obtained from the fit  @xcite to dis experimental data  @xcite while the distribution represented by the blue curve is not fitted but based on the model  @xcite .",
    "inclusive or semi - inclusive hard cross sections can be calculated by convoluting parton density and decay functions with partonic cross sections . for a detailed description of the exclusive structure of the final states , on the other hand ,",
    "event generators including parton showers and full hadronization are required .    in the collinear case ,",
    "cross sections are computed with on - shell initial partons . for many processes ,",
    "higher order calculations exist , and many of these are implemented in monte carlo ( mc ) simulation tools like powheg  @xcite , mc@nlo  @xcite , amc@nlo  @xcite , which combine next - to - leading order partonic calculations with parton showers and hadronization .",
    "these simulations all need a reshuffling of kinematic variables , after the parton shower is generated , in order to satisfy energy - momentum conservation , which can lead to significant kinematic shifts in the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "this is because transverse momentum is generated by the initial - state parton shower , which is not available when the hard scattering is computed . in certain phase",
    "space regions , these longitudinal shifts can affect the accuracy of the calculations significantly . using tmds , this kinematic reshuffling can be avoided from the beginning provided the tmds include transverse momenta generated by perturbative qcd evolution , which in turn can be evaluated according to different approximation schemes such as those in  ,  ,  @xcite .",
    "if a monte carlo method is used to solve the tmd evolution equation , a further advantage is that the solution of the evolution equation can be directly matched to the simulation of parton showers : the kinematic distributions are the same , whether they come from a solution of the evolution equation or from a simulation of the parton shower  @xcite .",
    "while a general purpose monte carlo at tmd level does not yet exist , examples of such algorithms  @xcite have been presented for specific cases .",
    "we list a few examples below .",

    "this is especially useful when event topologies are needed ( e.g. , to simulate the interplay of track correlations with detector performance ) , or where no explicit physics model is yet available to be employed in dedicated mc generators .",
    "+ @xmath46 mpythia and mlepto are based on lepto @xcite and  @xcite with a modification of the hard process @xcite to treat the azimuthal angle of the scattered ( light ) quark and via momentum conservation of the target remnant according to parameterizations of the sivers function .",
    "while limited to the rather specific case of the sivers effect it can make use of the hadronization embodied in jetset @xcite .",
    "* mc event generators at parton level with fragmentation functions + @xmath46 lxjet ( see @xcite ) is devoted to a calculation of jet cross sections at small @xmath13 in hadron - hadron collisions . it can be also viewed as an event generator as it allows one to generate unweighted events .",
    "it uses high - energy factorization  @xcite .",
    "gmc - trans ( see @xcite ) is a mc generator , developed by the hermes collaboration , applying the parton - model expression of the one - hadron semi - inclusive dis cross section using several models / parametrization for various leading - twist tmd pdfs and ffs .",
    "pion and charged - kaon production is simulated , both for proton and neutron targets ( or combinations thereof ) without including nuclear effects . an analytic expression for the semi - inclusive dis cross section",
    "was implemented based on the widely used gaussian ansatz of the transverse - momentum dependences .",
    "@xmath46 tmdgen ( see @xcite ) is an extended version of gmc - trans entirely written in c++ focusing mainly on di - hadron production in semi - inclusive dis .",
    "advances in computation power allowed for other than the gaussian ansatz of the transverse - momentum dependences by employing numeric integration algorithms .",

    "the @xmath0 resummation in resbos and parton showering methods of monte carlo event generators are complementary .",
    "both are based on all - order resummation using sudakov form factors .",
    "resbos allows the user to calculate resummed distributions of the higgs / vector bosons and their decay products up to nnll .",

    "the resummed results are matched to the fixed order calculation valid at high @xmath0 .",
    "the program can be used up to nnll+nlo , with the resummed part evaluated at nnll , the fixed order evaluated at nlo ( higgs / vector bosons plus one or two partons ) and with the normalization fixed to the total nnlo cross section .",
    "+ @xmath46 hres and dyres  @xcite are numerical programs which extend the calculations in hqt / dyqt by retaining the full kinematics of the higgs / vector bosons and of its decay products .",
    "the programs implement @xmath0 resummation up to nnll+nnlo and allow the user to apply arbitrary cuts on final states and to plot the corresponding distributions in form of bin histograms .",
    "we studied two sets of examples of multi - scale problems in hadronic collisions which require qcd factorization theorems beyond the collinear approximation and call for the use of tmd parton distributions . in one",
    "set of examples , the transverse momentum scale is small compared to the hard process scale ; in the other , the transverse momentum is of the order of the hard scale but this is much smaller than the total energy of the scattering . in both cases , factorization theorems in terms of tmd parton distributions",
    "are necessary in order both to resum logarithmically - enhanced perturbative corrections to all loops and to properly take into account nonperturbative hadron structure effects .",
    "these multi - scale regimes are relevant to lhc phenomenology .",
