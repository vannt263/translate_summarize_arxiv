    "ngc3077 is a prominent example of an interacting dwarf galaxy .",
    "together with the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 and the spiral galaxy m81 it forms the famous m81 triplet .",
    "although an interaction between the three galaxies is not at all obvious at optical wavelengths ( but see arp 1965 , getov & georgiev 1988 ) it has been long known through observations in the line that the 3 galaxies are interacting :  tidal arms and tails connect the three galaxies over a projected distance of more than 70 kpc ( cottrell 1977 , van der hulst 1979 , yun _ et al .  _  1994 )",
    ". the outstanding star forming activity in m82 is usually attributed to the gravitational interaction with m81 and/or ngc3077 .",
    "although the molecular and starburst properties of m82 have been the subject of innumerable studies , little is known about its starforming neighbor , ngc3077 .",
    "this is surprising since it has been long known that ngc3077 is experiencing intense star formation ( e.g. , barbieri _ et al .",
    "as noted by price & gullixson ( 1989 ) it is difficult to classify ngc3077 on basis of its optical morphology .",
    "emission line studies of ngc3077 ( e.g. , price & gullixson 1989 ; thronson , wilton & ksir 1991 ( twk91 ) ; martin 1997 , 1998 , 1999 ) show that streamers and supershells of ionized gas surround a bright core of h@xmath5 emission .",
    "this core is also associated with soft x ",
    "ray emission , consistent with intense star formation in the center ( bi et al.1994 ) .",
    "molecular gas in the center was detected by becker et al.(1989 ) using the iram 30 m telescope .",
    "first interferometric maps of the molecular component of ngc3077 using the ovro millimeter array have been presented by thronson & carlstrom ( 1992 ) and meier , turner & beck ( 2001 ) .",
    "some general information about ngc3077 is compiled in tab .  1 .",
    "the  in ngc3077 is strongly disrupted by the interaction with its two neighbors m81 and m82 : most of the neutral gas is located in a prominent tidal arm east of ngc3077 ( e.g. , van de hulst 1979 , yun 1994 , walter 1999 ) .",
    "walter & heithausen ( 1999 , see also heithausen & walter 2000 ) recently discovered a massive molecular complex in this tidal feature .",
    "numerical simulations suggest that the gas in the tidal arm has been stripped off the outskirts of ngc3077 during the latest close encounter with m81 , some 3 @xmath8 yr ago ( brouillet _ et al .",
    "_ 1990 , thomasson & donner 1993 , yun et al.1993 ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the suggestion of some authors ( price & gullixson 1989 , bi et al .",
    "1994 , twk91 ) , that ngc3077 accreted ( ` stole ' ) from m81 in this recent interaction . in the following",
    ", we will assume a distance to ngc3077 of 3.2mpc ( tammann & sandage 1968 ) .",
    "we note that this value has recently refined to be 3.9mpc ( sakai & madore 2001 ) , i.e. , 20@xmath9 higher , however we decided to use the old distance to make it easier to compare our results to earlier studies .    in this paper , we attempt to shed more light on the atomic and molecular gas as well as the starburst properties of ngc3077 and present a multi  wavelength study of this fascinating galaxy . in section  2",
    "we describe the observations of the atomic gas ( , vla ) , molecular gas ( co , ovro ) , optical broad and narrow band ( kpno ) and the nir ( nicmos hst ) .",
    "the different wavelengths are then compared and discussed in detail in section  3 .",
    "section  4 summarizes the most important results of our study and relates the gas and star formation properties of ngc3077 to those of its neighbor , m82 .",

    "this latter resolution starts to resolve individual giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) in ngc3077 .    to separate real emission from noise when deriving moment maps we applied the following procedure : the natural weighted data cube was convolved to a circular beam with a fwhm of @xmath29 .",

    "most of the in the region is situated in the prominent eastern tidal arm , little  is associated with the optical counterpart of ngc3077 ( contours ) .    to obtain accurate masses for ngc3077 we defined 3 different apertures as indicated in fig .  1 .",
    "the largest aperture ( i ) accounts for most of the in the field of view .",
    "aperture ii only includes which is roughly associated with the optical body of ngc3077  the smallest aperture ( iii ) only accounts for the central nucleus .",
    "the total fluxes ( and masses , adopting a distance to ngc3077 of 3.2mpc ) for the apertures are : ( i ) : 192.3 jy ( @xmath57 m@xmath2 ) , ( ii ) : 42.13 jy  ( @xmath58 m@xmath2 ) and ( iii ) : 11.30  ( @xmath59 m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the  content associated with the optical body of ngc3077 is therefore somewhere between @xmath60 m@xmath2  ( depending on the aperture chosen ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the massive complex east of ngc3077 has presumably been stripped off the outskirts of ngc3077 during the recent interaction with m81 .",
    "evidence for this comes from numerical simulations ( e.g. , yun et al .",
    "1993 ) which show that the material in the tidal arm east of ngc3077 originally belonged to ngc3077 itself .",
    "this scenario is supported by the high  resolution observations : figure  2 shows the velocity field of ngc3077 and the region around it . the mean velocity of the tidal feature is @xmath61  and close to the one of ngc3077 ( @xmath62 ) . note that the systemic velocity of m81 is some @xmath63  with velocities reaching @xmath64  in the spiral arms pointing towards ngc3077 ( westpfahl & adler 1996 ) .",
    "we also find no evidence for mass accretion and/or infall onto the centre of ngc3077 in our data .",
    "all this renders the possibility that the material originally belonged to m81 unlikely .",
    "an additional ( but somewhat weaker ) argument comes from the fact that the mass to blue light ratio in centre of ngc3077 is only @xmath65 m@xmath20/l@xmath17 ( see tab .  1 ) .",
    "if the in the tidal arm previously belonged to ngc3077 the  mass to blue light ratio is more like @xmath66m@xmath20/l@xmath17 , more typical for dwarf irregular galaxies ( this argument obviously only holds if ngc3077 was not a dwarf elliptical before the interaction ) .",
    "we conclude that the tidal gas around ngc3077 originated from ngc3077 itself .",
    "we note that since the total mass of the tidal system is similar in mass to ngc3077 itself ( heithausen & walter , 2000 ) , a complete detachment of this system ( i.e. , the creation of a true tidal dwarf system ) is likely ( but see meier , turner & beck 2001 ) .",

    "2 indicate the orientation of 3 position velocity ( pv ) diagrams through the  distribution around ngc3077 as shown in fig 3 .",
    "multiple velocity components are visible where the emission in the tidal feature is strongest .",
    "the cuts along the tidal arms towards m81 and m82 show a rather smooth velocity gradient away from the the maximum in the tidal feature . the first pv diagram ( fig .  3 , i ) cuts through the center of ngc3077 and the prominent tidal feature . the bright emission at offset 2.3@xmath13 is ngc3077 itself .",
    "multiple velocity components are visible in the tidal feature ( around offset -2@xmath13 ) .",

    "the co(10 ) channel maps as obtained with ovro are shown in fig .  4 ( based on the natural weighted data at 1.3resolution ) .",

    "the robust weighted ( @xmath67 , high velocity ( 1.3 ) resolution data cube with a gaussian clump fitting code ( stutzki & gsten 1990 ) as well as by eye . the clump fitting code ( ` gaussclump ' ) determines the maximum in the data cube and subtracts a 3d gaussian fit to the data ( ra , dec , velocity ) from the cube .",
    "the procedure works iteratively on the residual until the specified rms level ( 5 sigma in this case ) is reached . in this procedure the spatial and velocity resolution is taken into account ( for further detail see stutzki & gsten 1990 ) . each clump determined by ` gaussclump ' was checked by eye using pv - cuts and by inspecting spectra at individual positions . in case of doubt we reran gaussclump with different parameters for contrast , minimum spatial and velocity structures and other parameters controlling the gaussian fit .",

    "5 . nine out of the 16 components are at least partly visible in this diagram and are labeled by their respective number .",

    "although our resolution of 5@xmath14 ( @xmath126pc ) is too poor to resolve the emission , the radio continuum emission clearly shows that the most active starforming region is associated with the molecular complexes r1 and r2 . a comparison between the co kinematics and our  slit spectroscopy ( fig .  12 ,",
    "the orientation of the slit is indicated in fig .",

    "this is some 25% larger than the value obtained from the h@xmath5 emission alone and is a measure for the total extinction within ngc3077 .",
    "note that this is a factor of a few less than the value derived by meier , turner & beck ( 2001 ) who used 2.6 mm radio continuum emission to derive the sfr in ngc3077 .",

    "the total ( atomic and molecular ) gas content in the centre of ngc3077 is clearly displaced from the stellar component of ngc3077  this implies that not only the gas at large galactocentric radii is affected by the interaction within the triplet .",

    ", 16 complexes have been detected with our 2@xmath14 ( @xmath114pc ) beam .",
    "all of the complexes have virial masses which are lower than the masses calculated from the co luminosity ( assuming a galactic conversion factor ) .",
    "this implies that the conversion factor for ngc3077 is lower than the galactic value . at first glance ,",
    "this seems surprising since the conversion factor is usually believed to be higher in dwarf galaxies as compared to spirals such as our own galaxy ( arimoto _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 , wilson 1995 ) .",
    "however , the metallicity of ngc3077 is high ( o / h around solar ) for a dwarf ( martin 1998 ) , so this objection may not apply .",
    "the higher co emissivity and lower conversion factor can also be understood by an increased kinetic temperature and cosmic  ray heating near the starburst powering the outflow in ngc3077 .",
    "e.g. , in the case of m82 , wei  et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have shown that x@xmath72 may be as low as @xmath141@xmath74kkms@xmath75 .",
    "the prominent star forming regions as well as the outflow visible in h@xmath5 and pa@xmath5 , as well as the radio continuum source near the starburst already suggest that the state of the molecular gas in ngc3077 may be affected by the starburst ( similar to the case in m82 ) . indeed , as already pointed out by becker _",
    "et al .  _",
    "( 1989 ) , a co(2 - 1)/co(1 - 0 ) line intensity ratio of 0.82 ( on a t@xmath142 scale ) indicates that a substantial fraction of the gas is heated to kinetic temperatures @xmath143k . in a more recent study meier _",

    "; corrected for efficiencies at 115ghz ) we find t@xmath146k using lvg models .",
    "this supports the idea that the molecular gas in ngc3077 is heated by the starburst resulting in a lower conversion factor ( cf .",
    "weiss et al .",
    "2001 in the case of m82 ) .",
    "we find a striking correspondence between the co distribution and the dust cloud seen in the optical . from the pa@xmath5 and h@xmath5 imaging",
    "we estimate the extinction in the central dust complex to be an order of magnitude ( @xmath147mag ) . surprisingly , co emission is also coincident in position and velocity with a faint star forming region located 500pc west of ngc3077 , far off the central star formation .",
    "a comparison of the ionized outflow with the  shows that the distribution of  around ngc3077 s center is affected by the outflow .",
    "a puzzle is the presence of the ` radial ' dust  fingers which reach lengths up to @xmath148kpc .",
    "it may be that these dust lanes originally belonged to rudimentary spiral arms which have been ripped apart by the interaction .",
    "the dust lanes may have also been blown out of the ngc3077 s center by the violent sf ( e.g. , by radiation pressure ) .",
    "somewhat counter ",
    "intuitively , the most prominent lanes are associated with h@xmath5 emission .",
    "one way to interpret the apparent correlation of dust with h@xmath5 is that the surface of the dust filaments is exposed to the strong radiation field of the central starforming region which causes the weak emission on the rim of the filament .",
    "correcting for extinction , we derive a star formation rate ( sfr ) of 0.05m@xmath2yr@xmath6 for ngc3077 .",
    "although this value does not look dramatic one has to keep in mind that the star formation in ngc3077 is very concentrated towards the center .",
    "the effective area where massive star formation is found is @xmath149pc@xmath150 resulting in a sfr per surface area of @xmath151m@xmath2yr@xmath6pc@xmath152 , much higher than what is usually found in spiral galaxies ( e.g. martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "we will now compare the neutral hydrogen , molecular gas and starburst properties of ngc3077 to the corresponding parameters of the prototypical starburst galaxy m82 ( situated at a projected distance of only @xmath153kpc ) .",
    "about 10% of the total gas mass ( including the tidal arm ) of ngc3077 is associated with the optical galaxy ; the corresponding fraction for m82 is @xmath15470% ( yun et al .",
    "this suggests that ngc3077 lost most of its gas during the interaction whereas m82 was able to hold it .",
    "the central starbursting region of m82 still has a reservoir of about @xmath155 of neutral hydrogen ( more than @xmath04 times the corresponding value of ngc3077 ) ; the molecular gas content of m82 is @xmath156m@xmath2(@xmath157 times higher than in ngc3077 , wei  et al .",
    "2001 , d@xmath158=3.2mpc ) .",
    "the ratio of molecular to atomic gas in m82 s center is therefore of order unity , significantly higher than the same ratio in ngc3077 ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "this implies that the efficiency to form molecular out of atomic gas is much higher in m82 as compared to ngc3077 .",
    "interestingly the star formation efficiencies ( sfe ) are similar in ngc3077 and m82 : our  and co observations yield a sfe for ngc3077 of l@xmath160/m ( ) @xmath161 ( = @xmath162ergs@xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding value for m82 is about @xmath163 ( adopting l@xmath164ergs@xmath6 ; heckman _ et al .  _  1990 ,",
    "the true h@xmath5 flux in the centre of m82 is presumably somewhat higher due to the edge  on orientation of m82 ) .    in that sense ngc3077",
    "can be regarded as a scaled  down version of m82 : it has a similar star formation efficiency and shows a prominent outflow .",
    "the ` only ' differences may be that the overall total masses are different and that ngc3077 lost a larger fraction of its atomic gas during the interaction as m82 did . in any case",
