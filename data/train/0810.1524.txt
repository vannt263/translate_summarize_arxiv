    "a new confining unbroken non - abelian gauge interaction , in mimic of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) of strong interaction , may exist in models beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "okun @xcite pioneered in this theoretical curiosity long time ago and named these new particles `` thetons '' , including @xmath0-strings , @xmath0-leptons , @xmath0-quarks , @xmath0-hadrons , etc associated with the gauge group @xmath1 .",
    "this theory can also be regarded as a certain limit of qcd with light quarks removed such that the scale @xmath2 where qcd gets strong is much smaller than the heavy quark masses @xcite .",
    "phenomenology of this hypothetical qcd can be drastically different from the real world where light quarks do exist and one must have to worry about the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "for instance , heavy quarks are connected by unbreakable long and stable string flux tube since there is no light quark pairs popped up from the vacuum as the heavy quarks are being pulled apart . however , the @xmath0-fermions @xmath3 and @xmath4 of the new gauge interaction , if also carry standard model quantum numbers , have to be massive ( @xmath5 100 gev ) .",
    "otherwise , they would have been observed in current collider experiments .",
    "these heavy @xmath0-fermions were recently revived and renamed as `` quirks '' by kang and luty @xcite , who emphasized their fantastic event structures due to the long and stable string flux tube connecting them .",
    "we will briefly mention some of their observations here .",
    "for definiteness , let us assume that this new gauge group is @xmath6 with its characteristic scale @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the string flux tube is of order @xmath8 and it can be macroscopic for 100 ev @xmath9 10 kev , or mesoscopic for 10 kev @xmath9 mev , or microscopic for mev @xmath10 . in general ,",
    "one also assume @xmath11 is smaller than the @xmath12 such that the new color degree of freedom bears the name infracolor ( ic ) .",
    "we call this infracolor ( a.k.a .",
    "iqcd ) gluon fields igluons , and the fermions iquarks .",
    "it has been noticed that the infracolor is an example of the `` hidden valley '' model in ref.@xcite .",
    "the igluons do not carry sm quantum numbers .",
    "thus , iglueballs can only couple to sm gauge bosons through a heavy iquark loop assuming the heavy iquark is not a sm singlet . at two - loop level , the iglueballs can also couple to the sm fermions .",
    "thus , these iglueballs may have escaped detection . in the macroscopic @xmath11 scenario that once the @xmath13 is produced ,",
    "they would be linked by a long string roaming inside the detector .",
    "the infracolor dynamics can allow the @xmath14 bound state to survive for distances of order centimeter and preventing them from annihilation . in the mesoscopic @xmath11",
    "scenario , the @xmath15 pair will appear as a single entity inside the detector . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath11 is microscopic , the @xmath14 pair will lost most of their kinetic energy and angular momenta by emitting iglueballs and/or light qcd hadrons like pions before annihilation . in the latter case in which iquarks are qcd - colored , it leads to a hadronic fireball along with the other sm decay products of the iquarkonium .",
    "in particular , in the context of folded supersymmetry @xcite it was pointed out in ref.@xcite that production of the `` squirk - antisquirk '' pair @xmath16 at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) would quickly lose their excitation energy by bremsstrahlung and relax to the ground state of the scalar iquarkonium . however , the energy loss due to iglueball emissions is harder to estimate .    in this work ,",
    "we consider vector - like iquarks with respect to the electroweak gauge group but without carrying the qcd color .",
    "however , iquark carries a new color degree of freedom of @xmath17 .",
    "thus , iquarks do not mix with sm quarks or leptons since the latter do not carry the new color degrees of freedom .",
    "we also assume mev @xmath18 so that the strings are microscopic but yet unbreakable . in analogous to the case of folded supersymmetry @xcite , the bound states formed by the iquark - antiiquark pairs will annihilate promptly into sm particles .",
    "let @xmath19 denotes a heavy iquark doublet .",
    "the quantum number assignment for the iquark doublet @xmath19 under @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 these iquarks are the fractionally charged @xmath0-leptons in okun s terminology @xcite .",
    "the gauge interactions are given by @xmath22 where we have suppressed generation indices and ignored possible mixings among iquarks .",
    "@xmath23 are the generators of the @xmath24 in the defining representation where each iquark lives and @xmath25 is its coupling . for vector iquark @xmath26 or @xmath27 , we have @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the third - component of the weak isospin for the left- ( right- ) handed iquark @xmath3 .",
    "since we assume vector iquarks , @xmath30 , they have the same value for each component of @xmath31 . for each vectorial iquark doublet",
    ", we can also have a dirac bare mass term .",
    "due to the assumption of vectorial iquarks , precision electroweak data from lep do not provide any constraints even for a tev iquark doublet .",
    "there is no yukawa coupling between the sm higgs doublet and the vector iquarks .",
    "iquarks in the above model can be copiously produced at the lhc , not via normal qcd interactions , but via electroweak interactions .",
    "the iquarks are stable with respect to the collider time scale , and linked by a string .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath11 the iquarks will lose energy by emitting iglueballs and bremsstrahlung until the iquark pair linked by the string come together and form a iquarkonium @xcite .",
    "the life time of the iquarkonium then depends on the annihilation rates into sm particles . in accord with the normal quarkonium ,",
    "the life time of iquarkonium is inversely proportional to the square of the wave - function at the origin .",
    "the life time and decay patterns of the iquarkonium can therefore provide useful information about the quantum numbers of iquarks and the dynamics of the new strong interacting gauge group .    in this article , we set up detailed formulas for production and decay properties of the neutral @xmath13 and charged @xmath32 iquarkonia .",
    "our result extends a previous study on superheavy - quarkonia @xcite to our current interest in iquarks and iqcd .",
    "we will consider only one generation of iquark doublet .",
    "extension to multiple generations of iquark doublets is straightforward .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we present the cross sections for open production of iquarks . in sec .",
    "iii , we describe briefly the motion of the iquark once produced and the radiation . in sec .",
    "iv , we present the results on the annihilation of the @xmath33-wave iquarkonium and discuss the decay patterns .",
    "conclusions are made in sec .",
    "even though we assume iquarks do not carry the usual color of the strong qcd interaction , they can still be pair produced at cern lhc through electroweak interactions . in the following ,",
    "we list the formulas for the production amplitude squared of these hard partonic subprocesses .",

    "all the initial - state quark masses are set to be zero .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath51 and @xmath52 pairs can be frequently produced via the virtual @xmath53 boson in the annihilation of @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "there is only one @xmath38-channel diagram from the @xmath53 exchange .",
    "@xmath58 where @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 . as in the previous case ,",
    "all the initial - state quark masses are set to be zero .      with the above formulas eqs.([openproduction1])-([openproduction2 ] ) we present in fig .",
    "[ x - sec ] the production cross sections of iquarks at the lhc .",
    "the production rates are significant even though the iquarks are produced via electroweak interactions rather than qcd . for @xmath59 around @xmath60",
    "gev the cross sections are of order @xmath61 pb and are about an order of magnitude larger than the scalar iquarkonium case in folded supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "in contrast with qcd , due to the unbroken string flux tube , the two iquarks do not hadronize individually to form isolated jets .",
    "since we assume the iquark doublet is vector - like , the @xmath62-decay between doublet members is suppressed by small mass splittings due to radiative corrections .",
    "instead these initially flying - apart iquark - antiiquark pair will come back close to each other to form iquarkonium after losing their kinetic energies by radiating off iglueballs and photons @xcite .",
    "essentially , in the case of microscopic @xmath11 all open iquark pairs will , at the end , come together to form a iquarkonium .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the normal quarkonium , in which we have to force them to go together in the same direction ( e.g. by radiating one or more gluons ) and in roughly the same velocity in order to form a quarkonium .",
    "therefore , the iquarkonium production rates are not inferior to the quarkonium , although iquarks are only produced via electroweak interactions .",
    "we will discuss more about these interesting phenomena in the next section .",
    "production cross sections for @xmath63 and @xmath64 at the lhc .",
    "the label @xmath65 on the @xmath66-axis is for @xmath67 and @xmath64 production while @xmath68 is for @xmath69 production .",
    "we assume @xmath70 gev and set @xmath71 . , width=480 ]",
    "the iquarks are produced via electroweak interactions .",
    "once they are pair produced , they are still connected by a string or an iqcd flux tube .",
    "recall in usual qcd the flux tube gets broken by creation of light @xmath72 pairs .",
    "however , in iqcd the energy density stored in the string can not exceed @xmath73 , which is way smaller than the mass of iquarks .",
    "therefore , the iquark - antiiquark pair production is exponentially suppressed . the iglueball production from the vacuum",
    "is also expected to be suppressed due to its finite mass gap .",
    "thus , the string is relatively stable .",
    "nevertheless , the iquarks carry electric and weak charges so that it will undergo bremsstrahlung and ionization with the detector materials . in ref .",
    "@xcite , bremsstrahlung is treated semi - classically as two massive charged particles connected a string of tension @xmath73 .",
    "the rate energy loss is proportional to @xmath74 . on the other hand , the ionization energy loss when transversing the detector",
    "is given by the bethe - bloch equation @xcite .",
    "essentially , the penetrating particles lose energy by exciting the electrons of the material .",
    "ionization energy loss @xmath75 is a function of @xmath76 and the charge of the penetrating particle @xcite .",
    "the signature of iquarks due to the above two energy loss mechanisms is very spectacular .",
    "the ionization energy loss in the detector could give rise to observable tracks in the tracking sector of the detector .",
    "in addition , the bremsstrahlung photons may be , though soft , identified along with the iquarks .",
    "since the iquarks are roaming around in the detector connected by a string , there may be random tracks plus bremsstrahlung photons going along with the tracks . at the end of kinetic - energy loss",
    ", the iquarks and antiiquarks could be still far apart so that they can not annihilate .",
    "they would then stop inside the detector .      in this case",
    ", the size of the string is so small that when the iquarks lose their kinetic energy , they will come together to form a iquarkonium .",
    "the iquarkonium will then annihilate into sm particles .",
    "we will consider the annihilation channels in the next section . whether the iquarkonium can survive a period of time depends on",
    "( i ) the annihilation rate of the iquarkonium , and ( ii ) the rate of energy loss of the fast moving iquarks .",
    "it is easy to show that the annihilation rate into sm particles is proportional to @xmath77 where @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the radial wave - function at the origin , and @xmath80 is the mass of the iquarkonium . for heavy iquarkonium @xmath81 scales as @xmath82 , so that the overall annihilation rate scales as @xmath83 .",
    "on the other hand , the rate of energy loss of the fast moving iquarks depends on the bremsstrahlung rate and the rate of radiating iglueballs .",
    "while the rate of radiating the iglueballs is largely unknown , the bremsstrahlung rate is proportional to @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath85 gev the bremsstrahlung rate is faster than the annihilation rate .",
    "the iquark pair loses the kinetic energy to almost stationary and form the iquarkonium , which then survives a short period of time before annihilates . in this case , @xmath86-wave annihilation is negligible . for the case of very heavy iquarks @xmath87 tev ,",
    "the bremsstrahlung rate is comparable to the annihilation rate so that the iquarkonium annihilates right away while the iquarks are losing the kinetic energy . in this case , we expect the @xmath86-wave annihilation is also relevant",
    ". we will delay the @xmath86-wave annihilation to a future publication while we focus on the @xmath33-wave case in this paper .",
    "if the rate of radiating iglueball dominates over the bremsstrahlung , the discussion here is very straight - forward .",
    "the iquark and antiiquark quickly loses their kinetic energy , and the size of the string is so small that the iquark and antiiquark are readily coming together to form a iquarkonium , which then annihilates promptly . in this case , the annihilation rate is dominated by the @xmath33-wave states .",
    "in this section , we present the formulas for @xmath33-wave iquarkonium decays .",
    "we have checked that some of the results are consistent with a previous similar calculations for a superheavy quarkonium decays by barger _",
    "et al _ @xcite with appropriate modifications .",
    "however , parts of the results are genuinely new .        @xmath89    here , @xmath90 is the color factor for the fermion @xmath91 ( 1 for leptons and 3 for quarks ) , @xmath92 with @xmath80 being the mass of the iquarkonium , @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath96      @xmath98    here , we have defined @xmath99 and @xmath100 .      @xmath102    where @xmath103 .",
    "in addition to setting the axial vector couplings of the iquarks to be zero , we also exclude the higgs exchange contribution in the formulas of barger _",
    "et al _ @xcite because a vectorial iquark does not couple to the standard model higgs boson .",
    "using the feynman rules defined by eq.([lagrangian - gauge ] ) , one obtains @xmath105 here @xmath106 , @xmath107 and only @xmath108-channel exchange of the @xmath109 iquark contributes for the @xmath110 state .",
    "however , for the @xmath111 state , both the @xmath108- and @xmath38-channels appear with the following amplitudes @xmath112   \\epsilon_\\alpha(p ) \\epsilon_\\nu(k_1 ) \\epsilon_\\mu ( k_2)\\ ] ] where the @xmath113 or @xmath114 sign is for the case of @xmath115 or @xmath116 respectively and @xmath117   \\epsilon_\\alpha(p ) \\epsilon_\\nu(k_1 ) \\epsilon_\\mu ( k_2 ) \\ ; .\\ ] ] here @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 with @xmath121 or @xmath122 .",
    "note that these two amplitudes partially cancel each other if @xmath123 when the iquarks @xmath124 and @xmath27 are degenerate in mass for the vectorial iquarks .",
    "the cancellation is expected to reduce the large decay rate into longitudinal polarizations of @xmath125 bosons .",
