    "stable localized matter - wave structures in bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) are supported by the interplay between the intrinsic nonlinearity , which is induced by collisions between atoms , quantum pressure , which originates from the kinetic energy of atoms , and external potentials @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has made it possible to create bright solitons in condensates of @xmath0li and @xmath1rb atoms confined in cigar - shaped traps @xcite , where the inter - atomic interactions are made attractive by means of the feshbach resonance ( fr ) @xcite . in the condensate of @xmath2rb atoms with repulsive interactions , the introduction of an optical - lattice ( ol ) potential gives rise to gap solitons ( gss ) , as demonstrated experimentally in ref .",
    "@xcite , see also review @xcite .",
    "dark solitons have been created too , by means of various techniques , in the self - repulsive @xmath3rb condensate @xcite . in terms of the theoretical description ,",
    "the limit case of a very deep ol may be mapped , by means of the tightly - binding approximation , into a discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation and , accordingly , gss are mapped into _ staggered _ discrete solitons @xcite .",
    "new possibilities for the formation of matter - wave solitons are suggested by the presence of long - range interactions in dipolar condensates , which may be composed of magnetically polarized @xmath4cr atoms @xcite , dipolar molecules @xcite , or atoms in which electric moments are induced by a strong external field @xcite .",
    "solitons supported by the dipole - dipole ( dd ) interactions were predicted in two - dimensional ( 2d ) settings . in the isotropic configuration , with moments fixed perpendicular to the plane ,",
    "the natural dd interaction gives rise to repulsion , which can support delocalized states in the form of vortex lattices @xcite . in principle , the sign of the dd interaction in this configuration may be reversed by means of rapid rotation of the dipoles @xcite , suggesting a possibility to create isotropic solitons @xcite , as well as solitary vortices @xcite . on the other hand , stable anisotropic solitons have been predicted assuming the natural dd interaction between dipoles with a fixed in - plane polarization @xcite .",
    "in addition to these results pertaining to the bec context , it is relevant to mention that stable vortex rings were predicted in an optical model with the nonlocal thermal nonlinearity @xcite , and , elliptically shaped spatial solitons were created in such media experimentally @xcite .",
    "although one - dimensional ( 1d ) configurations may be simpler than their 2d counterparts , 1d matter - wave bright solitons were not yet studied in detail in models of dipolar condensates , except for discrete solitons of the unstaggered type , which were recently predicted in the condensate trapped in a deep ol @xcite . in those works ,",
    "both attractive and repulsive signs of the onsite ( contact ) nonlinearity and long - range dd interactions between sites of the respective lattice were considered .",
    "the objective of the present work is the theoretical study of various types of bright solitons possible in the continuum bec  model featuring the competition between the contact and dd interactions",
    ". the effective strength of the dd interactions in the 1d geometry can be controlled by adjusting the orientation of the dipoles with respect to the axis of the linear trap , while the strength of the contact interactions may be effectively tuned by means of the fr technique , as shown in the condensate of @xmath4cr atoms @xcite .",
    "the model is formulated both in the free space ( i.e. , in the absence of external potentials ) and in the presence of the ol potential , which opens additional possibilities for the creation of stable localized states , including gss ( note that staggered discrete solitons , which , as mentioned above , correspond to gss in the deep - ol  limit , were not considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the framework of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) with the ordinary local nonlinear term",
    ", the concept of gss was elaborated in detail , see refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite and review @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , it was not yet extended to the new physically relevant case , when the ol potential acts together with the long - range dd interaction  a situation that we address below .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the model is formulated in section ii , which , in section iii , is followed by the consideration of solitons supported by competing nonlinearities   attractive local / repulsive dd , or vice versa  in the free space .",
    "the model which combines the competing nonlinearities of both types and the ol is considered in section iv . in that case , we report results for regular solitons in the semi - infinite gap , and for gss in the two lowest finite bandgaps . in section v , we deal with collisions between moving solitons in the absence of the ol .",
    "the paper is concluded by section vi .",
    "our aim is to construct soliton states within the framework of the 1d gpe for the mean - field wave function , @xmath5 .",
    "the scaled equation includes the ol potential , @xmath6 ( where @xmath7 is the strength of the ol , while its period is normalized to be @xmath8 ) , the local nonlinear term with the respective coefficient , @xmath9 , and its nonlocal counterpart , with coefficient @xmath10 , which accounts for the dd interactions : @xmath11 \\psi ,   \\label{gpe}\\]]where subscripts denote partial derivatives .",
    "the kernel @xmath12 of the dd term was taken in two different ways , so as to avoid the divergence at @xmath13 .",
    "the first version relies on an explicit cut - off ( _ co kernel _ ) , @xmath14where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "the other choice makes use of the regularized expression deduced in ref .",
    "@xcite by means of the single - mode approximation ( sma ) , i.e. , the _ sma kernel _ : @xmath16 being the standard complimentary error function .",
    "the two kernels are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : dipole ] .",
    "the most significant difference between them is that the sma version features a cusp at @xmath17 , whereas the co kernel has a smooth maximum .",
    "we have concluded that the choice of @xmath18 in co expression ( [ eq : kernel0 ] ) , which makes areas beneath both curves equal , provides for the best proximity of the corresponding results to what has been found using the sma approximation .",
    "below , we report results obtained with the sma kernel , as its co counterpart yields virtually identical findings .    , and its single - mode approximation ( sma ) counterpart , which are based on eqs .",
    "( [ eq : kernel0 ] ) and ( [ eq : kernel1 ] ) , respectively . ]",
    "we fix the normalizations in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) by setting @xmath19 , and then vary @xmath9 . in the the case of the @xmath4cr condensate ,",
    "a characteristic value of the relative strength of the dd and contact interactions , which may be estimated as @xmath20 , is @xmath21 @xcite ; this value may be altered in broad limits by means of the fr technique .",
    "the interactions are repulsive or attractive for @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we will focus on the case of _ competing _ interactions , with @xmath24 , which is the most interesting one ; in the case when both nonlinearities have the same sign , results turn out to be very similar to those reported previously in the local model .",
    "it is relevant to mention that , in terms of discrete systems , the competition of on - site ( local ) and inter - site ( short - range nonlocal ) interactions in 1d and 2d salerno lattices were considered in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "a number of stable discrete - soliton states which are impossible in the absence of the competition were reported in those works , including cuspons and peakons in 1d , and vortex breathers in 2d .",
    "stationary solutions to eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) with chemical potential @xmath25 are sought as @xmath26 .",
    "to construct such solutions , we discretize the resulting equation for @xmath27 by means of a finite - difference scheme , which leads to a set of coupled algebraic equations , @xmath28with @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "solutions to eq .",
    "( [ gpediscr ] ) are sought by dint of the newton - raphson scheme .",
    "results were obtained with a reasonable accuracy by choosing @xmath31 . to present soliton families , we will use norm @xmath32 and width @xmath33 of the soliton , @xmath34these definitions were adapted to the finite - difference form of the model as well .",
    "stability of the solutions was analyzed in the standard way ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , by considering a perturbation in the form of @xmath35 $ ] ( where @xmath36 stands for complex conjugate ) .",
    "the linearized equations for the perturbation eigenmodes ( i.e. , the bogoliubov - de gennes equations ) are written as @xmath37where we define @xmath38 , \\end{aligned}\\]]@xmath39the instability sets in when there emerges an eigenvalue with @xmath40 .",
    "stability eigenvalues were obtained from a numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ bdg ] ) , by means of a standard eigenvalue solver from fortran - based software package lapack @xcite .",
    "we start the presentation of results by considering the model with competing nonlinearities in the free space , i.e. , with @xmath41 in eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) .",
    "this implies that solitons may exist with @xmath42 .",
    "in accordance with what was said above , we first fix @xmath43 ( the repulsive dd interaction ) , and vary negative @xmath9 ( local attraction ) and negative @xmath25 . in this case , solitons exist for every @xmath44 ; however , due to discretization , the numerical solution of eq .",
    "( [ gpediscr ] ) , with the above - mentioned choice of @xmath31 , yields solitons in the region of @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , although very narrow solitons indeed exist at arbitrarily small values of @xmath46 , the soliton s width becomes comparable to or smaller than this value of @xmath47 at @xmath48 , i.e. , a better numerical accuracy is required to produce accurate soliton solutions in this range .",
    "note that , for very narrow solitons with amplitude @xmath49 , the nonlinear part of eq .",
    "( [ gpediscr ] ) , with @xmath50 , takes the form of @xmath51 .",
    "the existence of the soliton demands a negative coefficient in this expression , i.e. , @xmath52where it was taken into regard that @xmath53 , as per eq .",
    "( eq : kernel1 ) .",
    "in particular , for @xmath31 , condition ( [ deltax ] ) amounts to @xmath45 , as said above .",
    "figure [ fig : profiles](a ) shows typical examples of the solitons in the present case , while fig .",
    "[ fig : normar ] represents soliton families in terms of dependences @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for fixed values of @xmath9 and @xmath25 , respectively ; note that plots in panel ( b ) of the latter figure are cut at @xmath56 , as the numerical accuracy is insufficient to extend them to smaller values of @xmath57 , as explained above .",
    "the stability of the solitons was verified both through the computation of the eigenvalues , using eq .",
    "( bdg ) , and by means of direct simulations of the evolution of perturbed solitons .",
    "the well - known vakhitov  kolokolov criterion , @xmath58 vk , also suggests the stability of solitons in this case , although the negative slope of the @xmath54 curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : normar](a ) is very small .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the presence of the ol , the solitons can be made mobile ( by application of a kick to them ) if the nonlinearity in the model is weak enough ; otherwise , the respective peierls ",
    "nabarro is very high . in the weak - nonlinearity regime ,",
    "the mobility of gss in the present model is quite similar to that reported in the local model with the self - repulsive interactions @xcite , as well as in the discrete model including the dd interactions @xcite .",
    "this work presents results of the systematic analysis of one - dimensional bright solitons supported by contact and dipole - dipole ( dd ) interactions of opposite signs in bec . in the absence and in the presence of the optical lattice ( ol ) ,",
    "stable soliton families have been found for the cases of local attraction and dd repulsion or vice versa . in particular ,",
    "free - space solitons can be supported by arbitrarily weak local attraction if the dd repulsion is fixed ; in the opposite case , there is a maximum value of the strength of the local repulsion , beyond which solitons do not exist ( which was explained in an analytical form ) . in the model including the ol , a notable finding is a region of stability of subfundamental solitons ( sfss ) in the second finite bandgap .",
    "it is noteworthy too that , as seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : existra ] and [ fig : existar ] , the gap solitons ( gss ) exist , in the case of the attractive dd interaction , if the contact repulsion is strong enough , and , in the opposite case of the repulsive dd interaction , gss exist if the contact attraction is not too strong .    collisions between bright solitons in the free space were considered too .",
    "the collision scenario is the usual one in the case of the local attraction ( merger and quasi - elastic passage at small and large velocities , respectively ) , while in the opposite case , when the local interaction is repulsive , a region of rebound was additionally found at smallest values of the velocities , which is explained by the long - range repulsion between the solitons .",
