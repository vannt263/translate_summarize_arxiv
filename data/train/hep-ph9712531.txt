    "an ambitious experimental program to study rare decays of @xmath6 mesons is under way worldwide .",
    "the main goal of this program is to probe the standard model description of quark - mixing , including cp violation .    within the standard model quark - mixing",
    "is described by a @xmath7 unitary matrix , the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix .",
    "@xcite a unitary @xmath7 matrix is described by three angles ( analogous to euler angles ) and six phases . in the standard model five of the six phases are non - physical .",
    "they can be eliminated by redefining the phases of the quark fields .",
    "the one remaining phase could in principle provide for a very rich set of cp violating phenomena",
    ". however , nature , as we know it , appears to have chosen the angles such that all but two of the matrix elements may have approximately the same phase , zero by convention .",
    "the two matrix elements that stand out are @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    at present , the experimentally preferred ranges  @xcite for the phases of these elements are given by : @xmath10    they are obtained using the unitarity constraint @xmath11 , in combination with measurements of @xmath12 , as well as @xmath13 mixing , @xmath14 and @xmath15 from semi - leptonic @xmath6 decays , and cp violation in @xmath16 .",
    "the factor of six difference in the preferred region for the two phases is mostly due to the geometry of this `` unitarity triangle '' rather than to the difference in errors on @xmath17  @xcite and @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "a number of experiments expect to measure @xmath19  ( @xmath20arg@xmath21 ) within the next few years .",
    "each one of them expects to reach a sensitivity somewhat better than the precision we currently have via indirect means . while this will already provide for a stringent test of the standard model",
    ", one would ideally want to measure arg@xmath22 to similar precision to verify that the phase structure of nature s preferred quark - mixing matrix is consistent with coming from a single phase .",
    "there is certainly no dearth of techniques for measuring arg@xmath22  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , most techniques either require @xmath23 decays or rather large number of @xmath24 decays .",
    "one of the experimentally more promising techniques to measure arg@xmath0 was proposed by fleischer  @xcite . in his paper",
    ", fleischer acknowledges that his method can only provide a rough estimate of @xmath25 without attempting to quantify the precision obtainable .",
    "we show in the present paper that this theoretical error is small compared to the experimental error ( at least in the near future ) for a large part of the allowed parameter space .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives an overview of the method , as well as a justification for the range of parameters used throughout the paper .",
    "section iii discusses the theoretical uncertainty on arg(@xmath9 ) using this method .",
    "section iv provides estimates of the expected experimental error for one `` nominal year '' of pep - ii and cesr phase 4 . and",
    "section v discusses the experimental sensitivity towards measuring direct cp violation in @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , we show that for cesr phase 4 luminosities we will either measure direct cp violation or arg(@xmath27 ) to within reasonable theoretical uncertainties .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section vi .",
    "after completion of this work we have learned of a paper by gronau and rosner  @xcite that also discusses this triangle from a somewhat different perspective .",
    "the decay amplitudes for the decays @xmath29 and @xmath30 are given by : @xmath31    here @xmath32 refer to the @xmath33 external w - emission and gluonic penguin ( @xmath34quark in the loop ) amplitudes respectively .",
    "there are in principle also contributions from color - suppressed electroweak penguin , and annihilation diagrams .",
    "these are expected to amount to at most a few percent , and are therefore ignored here.@xcite    recently , it has been pointed out  @xcite that soft final - state interactions may drastically enhance contributions from annihilation diagrams .",
    "furthermore , arguments based on isospin  @xcite imply that these contributions can in general not be neglected .",
    "the large samples of @xmath35 decays expected at babar , belle , and cleo in the next few years will allow us to decide this question experimentally  @xcite .",
    "neglecting soft final - state interactions , the only non - trivial weak phase in these decays is arg@xmath36 .",
    "the triangle constructions in figure  [ fig : fltri1 ] thus allow for the determination of arg(@xmath9 ) up to a fourfold ambiguity from the following time integrated decay rate measurements if @xmath37 is known .",
    "@xmath38    here @xmath39  is the strong phase difference between the sum of the two penguin amplitudes and the external w - emission amplitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : fltri1](a ) illustrates the special case @xmath40 .",
    "the circle depicts @xmath41 . allowing for @xmath42 results in a rotation as shown in figure  [ fig : fltri1](b ) .",
    "this rotation produces direct cp violation , meaning a rate asymmetry between @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the size of @xmath41 may be determined either from @xmath45 , assuming factorization , or from @xmath46 , correcting for the extra contribution due to color - suppressed w - emission in this decay .",
    "both of these determinations are plagued by theoretical uncertainties at the @xmath47 level .",
    "assuming factorization , we can relate @xmath41 to @xmath45 at @xmath48 via :  @xcite @xmath49    our present estimate of @xmath41 is limited by the statistics of the experimental data in @xmath45 .",
    "however , in a few years this error due to statistics will be small compared to the error on @xmath50 . for @xmath51 transitions , theory  @xcite ( @xmath52 ) and experiment  @xcite ( @xmath53 ) agree quite well .",
    "however , it is far from obvious to us how well this will extrapolate from `` heavy - to - heavy '' ( @xmath51 ) to `` heavy - to - light '' ( @xmath54 ) transitions .",
    "we therefore set @xmath55 with a 10% error .",
    "we expect this to be the dominant source of uncertainty in the future .",
    "unfortunately , the situation in @xmath54 decays is different from @xmath51 decays in that there are no non - leptonic decays for which only contributions from external w - emission are relevant .",
    "the closest one can come to an experimental measurement of @xmath41 in non - leptonic @xmath6 decays is via : @xmath56    the factor @xmath57 enters because @xmath58 has contributions from color - allowed as well as color - suppressed w - emission amplitudes , whereas @xmath41 refers to the color - allowed transition only .",
    "again , one can infer @xmath59 in @xmath54 decays from a measurement in @xmath51 decays .",
    "so far , cleo has measured only @xmath60 .",
    "@xcite however , within the next few years cleo , babar , and belle will each be able to measure @xmath61 to within @xmath62 . while @xmath59 may eventually be measured quite precisely in @xmath51",
    "decays , it is again the extrapolation from @xmath51 to @xmath54 that is likely to be the dominant source of uncertainty in determining @xmath41 in this fashion .    in principle , uncertainties due to non - factorizable su(3 ) symmetry breaking effects also affect this method for estimating @xmath41 .",
    "however , they are probably small compared to the uncertainties in @xmath50 and @xmath59 respectively .    using the recent cleo result  @xcite @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and equation  ( [ eq : tkpilnu ] ) our present best guess for @xmath65 is given by :    @xmath66    in the future , combining equations  ( [ eq : tkpilnu ] ) and ( [ eq : tkpipi ] ) may eventually allow for a determination of @xmath41 to within @xmath67 .",
    "in the following , we present estimates of the error on the measured arg(@xmath9 ) as a function of the geometry of the @xmath68 amplitude triangles , the true value for @xmath25 , the relative error on @xmath41 ( @xmath69 ) , and the strong phase difference @xmath39 .",
    "we choose @xmath70 throughout .",
    "however , we verified that varying @xmath71 within a reasonable range has only a small effect .",
    "the point of this exercise is to `` propagate '' the theoretical error on @xmath41 into an error on arg(@xmath9 ) , and show how this error propagation depends on nature s choice for the size of the relevant quantities involved .",
    "let us first look at the fourfold ambiguity in determining @xmath25 via the @xmath72 amplitude triangles .",
    "a strong phase difference @xmath73 produces the same triangles as @xmath40 , except that now @xmath74 is given by the angle inside the two triangles .",
    "this ambiguity of interpreting the inside or outside angle as @xmath74 makes up half of the fourfold ambiguity in extracting @xmath25 in this fashion .",
    "the other half is given by flipping one of the two triangles around the baseline as shown in figure  [ fig : fltri2 ] .",
    "the effect of @xmath75 on the measured @xmath25 strongly depends on the geometry of the two triangles .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : fltri3](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "an error on @xmath41 will affect @xmath25 most if one or both of the two triangles are close to degenerate ( [ fig : fltri3](b ) ) , and least if @xmath41 is close to tangential to one or both of the circles with radius @xmath76 and @xmath77 ( [ fig : fltri3](a ) ) . for @xmath78",
    "one can easily imagine a situation where one or both triangles no longer close .",
    "figure  [ fig : dphinorestrict ] shows measured versus true @xmath25 for @xmath79 ( left ) and @xmath80 ( right ) respectively .",
    "no restrictions on the geometry are applied here .",
    "these figures are generated as follows .",
    "we assume infinite statistics for the branching fraction measurements .",
    "we then choose some `` true '' value for @xmath25 , @xmath81 , and @xmath39 .",
    "these are drawn randomly from flat distributions within the specified ranges ( @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 ) .",
    "having fixed these parameters we then `` measure '' @xmath5 . in the end , each point in these figures corresponds to a possible pair of measured and true @xmath25 .",
    "we show only one of the four possible solutions for @xmath25 in these figures .",
    "a second set of solutions is given by the reflection of the figure along the axis true @xmath85 .",
    "the third and fourth solution are not very illuminating as they correspond to measuring @xmath39 instead of @xmath25 within a twofold ambiguity .",
    "the `` line '' at measured @xmath85 is due to the fact that we set @xmath85 if neither of the triangles closes .",
    "there appears to be a @xmath86 degree range of values for the true @xmath25 for any given measured @xmath25 .",
    "however , this is somewhat misleading as can be seen in figure  [ fig : restrictgeo ] .",
    "here we assumed that nature is kind to us experimentalists in that the measured angles ( @xmath87 ) between @xmath41 and @xmath88 for the two triangles turn out to be in the range @xmath89 , and @xmath90 .",
    "in other words , nature s choice is a geometry closer to figure  [ fig : fltri3 ] ( a ) rather than ( b ) .",
    "the range of possible true values for a given measured value of @xmath25 then reduces from about @xmath91 to @xmath92 . in this case the four possible solutions for @xmath25 tend to be clearly separated .",
    "this is unfortunately not the case for figure  [ fig : dphinorestrict ] .",
    "= 7.5 cm = 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm      it has often been stated that the large @xmath93 in @xmath6 decays to @xmath94 leads to rather small final state interactions , and thereby to very small @xmath39 . the case of small @xmath39 is therefore of special interest .    for the experimentally preferred range of @xmath95 we are in general less sensitive to @xmath96 if @xmath97",
    "this is immediately obvious from the discussion of the geometry above . to get a degenerate triangle requires @xmath98 for @xmath99 , or @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "if strong phase differences are indeed small then this means that @xmath102 is largely free of uncertainties due to @xmath81 .",
    "this is shown graphically in figures  [ fig : dphizero ] and [ fig : dphirestricted ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : dphizero ] shows the envelopes for @xmath103 and @xmath104 for @xmath105 . and figure  [ fig : dphirestricted ] depicts the range of possible measured versus true @xmath25 for @xmath80 and @xmath106 .",
    "for a significant part of the currently preferred range ( @xmath107 ) the theoretical error is less than about @xmath108 if @xmath109 .",
    "this compares well with the expected experimental error presented in the next section .",
    "cleo has recently measured  @xcite @xmath110 and @xmath63 . in both cases averaging over charge conjugate states",
    "is implied .",
    "these measurements use @xmath111fb@xmath112 of integrated luminosity , taken at the @xmath35 resonance .",
    "the design luminosity for pep - ii and cesr phase 4 is @xmath113fb@xmath112 and @xmath114fb@xmath112 per @xmath115 seconds , with pep - ii starting operations in 1999 , and cesr phase 4 being planned for 2003 .",
    "an estimate of the future error on the relevant @xmath28 branching fractions may be obtained as follows .",
    "we repeat the recent cleo analysis for @xmath26 on monte carlo generated data that has the @xmath94 particle i d separation dialed up to @xmath116 but is otherwise modelled to reflect the distributions found in cleo data .",
    "we do this for 1,000 monte carlo experiments , allowing for poisson fluctuations of the number of generated signal events in @xmath117 and @xmath118 around the central values as determined in data .",
    "we measure the error on @xmath119 for each experiment and determine the mean error , averaged over the 1,000 experiments .",
    "we then scale this mean error on the branching fraction by @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively to arrive at an expected error of @xmath122 and @xmath123 for one `` nominal '' year of pep - ii and cesr phase 4 .",
    "the measured yield in @xmath124 is roughly half that of @xmath118 .",
    "we therefore expect @xmath3 to be measured with roughly the same precision as either one of the charge conjugate modes for @xmath26 .",
    "we can now repeat the monte carlo exercise from the previous section , allowing for a gaussian error on all sides , but no theoretical error on @xmath41 .",
    "we assume the relative error on @xmath41 to be the same as that for the other sides .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming a yield in @xmath125 half that for @xmath26 .",
    "this is consistent with the latest cleo results .",
    "the resulting gaussian error on @xmath25 is @xmath126 , and @xmath127 for a @xmath122 , and @xmath123 error on the measured branching fractions .",
    "in the section on the geometry of the triangle we have shown that the error on @xmath25 is largest if one of the two triangles is degenerate . given the experimentally preferred range of @xmath128",
    "such a geometry tends to imply a large cp violating asymmetry in @xmath26 . in this section",
    "we want to explore this a little further by showing that ( at least for cesr phase 4 type luminosities ) we are in a `` win - win '' situation for a large part of the experimentally preferred range in @xmath25 .",
    "we either measure direct cp violation or @xmath25 with reasonably small theoretical uncertainties .    in general :",
    "@xmath129    for example , for @xmath130 and @xmath131 a limit of about @xmath132 would constrain @xmath133 , the value chosen for figure  [ fig : dphirestricted ] .",
    "let us briefly look at the expected sensitivity for measuring direct cp violation in @xmath118 .",
    "cleo uses a maximum likelihood fit to measure the yield in @xmath43 ( @xmath134 ) and @xmath44 ( @xmath135 ) . the error on the asymmetry is then given by : @xmath136    the errors on @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) are in general larger than @xmath139 because of backgrounds from continuum as well as @xmath140 , and @xmath141 double miss - id .",
    "this also leads to a non - zero value of the correlation coefficient ( @xmath142 ) between @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "in general , @xmath94 double miss - id causes @xmath143 whereas cp symmetric backgrounds lead to @xmath144 .    at present @xmath145 . using monte carlo we can dial up the @xmath141 separation to @xmath116 to simulate a cleo iii analysis .",
    "this results in @xmath146 .",
    "to scale @xmath138 we use : @xmath147    for a counting analysis , @xmath148 is just the expected background to signal ratio . in a multi - dimensional likelihood fit like the cleo analysis",
    ", one generally includes large sidebands in the fit .",
    "there is therefore no simple definition of @xmath148 because there is no obvious signal box defined .",
    "we therefore define an `` effective @xmath148 '' via : @xmath149    the average is formed over many monte carlo generated experiments of @xmath111fb@xmath112 integrated luminosity each .",
    "when we increase the @xmath141 particle i d separation in monte carlo to @xmath116 we find @xmath150 .",
    "for the current cleo analysis ( @xmath94 separation @xmath151gev@xmath152 ) this effective @xmath148 is about a factor of three worse . to determine @xmath148 we assume @xmath153 .",
    "however , the resulting value for @xmath148 depends only very weakly on this ratio .    using equation ( [ eq : sigmani ] ) we can rewrite equation ( [ eq : sigacp ] ) into a more useful form : @xmath154    -90    here",
    "@xmath155 refers to the efficiency times @xmath35 cross section , and @xmath156 to the integrated luminosity .",
    "we can now use equation  [ eq : sigacpsqr ] to compute the @xmath116 discovery limit for @xmath157 as a function of integrated luminosity .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig : sigacp ] .",
    "we have assumed here @xmath158nb , and @xmath159 .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath150 .",
    "the dotted lines represent @xmath160 and @xmath161 respectively .",
    "changing @xmath142 within a factor of two makes no difference and is therefore not shown .    from figure",
    "[ fig : sigacp ] we see that with @xmath162 we could establish @xmath163 at the @xmath116 level if we measured @xmath164 .",
    "the corresponding number for @xmath113fb@xmath112 is @xmath165 .",
    "figure  [ fig : acpgamma ] shows the remaining theoretical uncertainty on measuring @xmath25 as discussed in the previous section if @xmath166 .",
    "the design luminosities of pep - ii and cesr phase 4 are @xmath113fb@xmath112 and @xmath114fb@xmath112 per @xmath115 seconds , with pep - ii starting operations in 1999 , and cesr phase 4 being planned for 2003 .",
    "we have evaluated experimental as well as theoretical errors for a determination of arg@xmath167 at these future colliders , using branching fraction measurements for @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath125 , and @xmath171 for @xmath45 .",
    "the angle @xmath25 is obtained from these measurements up to a fourfold ambiguity via construction of two amplitude triangles .",
    "we project that @xmath113fb@xmath112 ( @xmath114fb@xmath112 ) of data taken at the @xmath35 resonance should result in an experimental error on @xmath5 of @xmath126 ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "this estimate does not rely on any future improvements to the existing cleo analysis other than the @xmath116 particle i d separation between charged kaons and pions that is expected for cleo iii as well as babar .",
    "we find that the theoretical error on @xmath5 depends strongly on the geometry of the two amplitude triangles .",
    "for the experimentally preferred range of @xmath25 ( @xmath172 ) the theoretical errors tend to be small for small strong phase differences .",
    "in particular , for strong phase differences @xmath109 theoretical uncertainties of about @xmath108 for @xmath173 can be expected . however ,",
    "if we allow for large strong phase shifts theoretical errors @xmath174 times as large are easily possible .    given the experimentally preferred range for @xmath5 , sizeable strong phase shifts would result in direct cp violation large enough to be easily measurable with one year of `` nominal luminosity '' for cesr phase 4 ( @xmath114fb@xmath112 ) .",
