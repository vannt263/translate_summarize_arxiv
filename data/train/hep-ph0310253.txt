    "the investigation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) qcd in the context of the schwinger - dyson ( sd ) dynamical equations of motion has been initiated by the pioneering paper of t hooft @xcite .",
    "he used the free gluon propagator in the light - cone gauge , which is free from ghost complications .",
    "he used also the large @xmath3 ( the number of colors ) limit technique in order to make the perturbation ( pt ) expansion with respect to @xmath4 reasonable . in this case the planar diagrams are reduced to quark self - energy and ladder diagrams , which can be summed .",
    "the bound - state problem within the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) formalism was finally obtained free from the infrared ( ir ) singularities .",
    "the existence of a discrete spectrum only ( no continuum in the spectrum ) was demonstrated . since this pioneering paper 2d qcd continues to attract attention ( see , for example , review @xcite and recent papers @xcite and references therein ) . despite its simplistic vacuum structure",
    "it remains a rather good laboratory for the modern theory of strong interactions , which is four - dimensional ( 4d ) qcd @xcite .    in our previous publications",
    "@xcite we have investigated 2d qcd in the arbitrary covariant gauge for the first time . in these works a new , nonperturbative ( np ) solution ( using neither large @xmath3 limit technique explicitly nor a weak coupling regime , i.e. , ladder approximation ) to 2d qcd in the covariant gauge",
    "is obtained in the context of the above - mentioned sd equations , complemented by the corresponding slavnov - taylor ( st ) identities .",
    "it is well known , however , that covariant gauges , in general , are complicated by the ghost contributions .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that ghost degrees of freedom can be considerable within our approach @xcite .",
    "the ghost - quark sector contains a very important piece of information on quark degrees of freedom themselves through the corresponding quark st identity .",
    "this is just the information which should be self - consistently taken into account . in this way",
    "a close set of equations has been derived for the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this letter is to exactly solve the obtained system of equations in the chiral limit and to develop analytical methods of its solution in the general case , i.e. , for the nonzero current quark masses .",
    "let us emphasize in advance that we have found a general solution for the heavy quark propagator , which by no means could be reduced to the free one .",
    "all of this will provide the necessary basis for future numerical calculations as well .",
    "the final system of equations , obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for the quantities in the quark sector , are presented by the quark sd equation and the quark st identity as follows ( euclidean signature ) :",
    "@xmath5    for simplicity , here we remove an overbar from the definitions of the renormalized green s functions , retaining it only for the coupling constant @xmath6 ( which has the dimensions of mass ) in order to distinguish it from initial ( `` bare '' ) coupling constant .",
    "it contains all known finite numerical factors .",
    "@xmath7 is obviously the proper quark - gluon vertex at zero momentum transfer .",
    "the euclidean version of our parametrization of the quark propagator is as follows : @xmath8 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables and functions as @xmath9 .",
    "performing further some tedious algebra of the @xmath10 matrices in 2d euclidean space , the system ( 2.1 ) can be explicitly reduced to a system of a coupled , nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the first order for the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quark propagator form factors , namely    @xmath13    where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the euclidean dimensionless momentum variable @xmath16 . for the dimensionless current quark mass ,",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath17 .",
    "the formal exact solution of the system ( 2.2 ) for the dynamically generated quark mass function is    @xmath18    and @xmath19 is the constant of integration .",
    "not losing generality , it can be fixed as @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is some constant momentum squared , and    @xmath22    with    @xmath23    then the equation determining the @xmath11 function becomes    @xmath24      as was emphasized in refs.@xcite , the important observation is that the formal exact solution ( 2.3 ) exhibits the algebraic branch point at @xmath25 , which completely @xmath26 at any finite point on the real axis in the @xmath16-complex plane whatever the solution for the @xmath11 function might be .",
    "thus the solution for the quark propagator can not be presented as the expression having finally a pole - type singularity at any finite point @xmath27 ( euclidean signature ) , i.e. ,    @xmath28    certainly satisfies thereby the first necessary condition of quark confinement , formulated at the fundamental quark level as the absence of a pole - type singularity in the quark propagator @xcite .",
    "it is well known that such kind of unphysical singularity ( algebraic branch point at @xmath25 ) is due to the inevitable ghost contributions in the covariant gauge qcd . however , as was explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , it will not cause any problems within our approach in order to calculate truly np quantities , such as quark condensate .",
    "the absence of a pole - type singularities in the quark propagator as a criterion of confinement at the microscopic level is only first necessary condition .",
    "the second sufficient condition of this criterion , formulated at the macroscopic ( hadron ) level , is the existence of a discrete spectrum only ( no continuum in the spectrum ) in the bound - state problem within the corresponding bs formalism @xcite .",
    "its discussion is obviously beyond the scope of the present letter .",
    "from a coupled system of the differential equations ( 2.2 ) it is easy to see that this system @xmath29 ,    @xmath30    and @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    thus any nontrivial solution automatically breaks the @xmath33 invariance of the quark propagator , and therefore @xmath34 leads to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breakdown at the fundamental quark level ( @xmath35 , dynamical quark mass generation ) . in all previous investigations",
    "a chiral symmetry preserving solution always exists . for simplicity , we do not distinguish between @xmath12 and @xmath36 , calling both dynamically generated quark mass functions .",
    "a few remarks are in order .",
    "a nonzero , dynamically generated quark mass function defined by condition ( 2.8 ) is the order parameter of dbcs at the fundamental quark level . at the phenomenological level",
    "the order parameter of dbcs is the nonzero chiral quark condensate determined as @xmath37 within our approach ( see ref .",
    "@xcite and @xmath38 is explicitly given below in eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) ) . in general , it can be formally zero , even when the mass function is definitely nonzero .",
    "thus the nonzero , dynamically generated quark mass is a much more appropriate condition of dbcs than the quark condensate .",
    "one may say that this is the first necessary condition of dbcs , while the nonzero chiral quark condensate is the second sufficient one",
    ".      in the chiral limit ( @xmath39 ) the system ( 2.2 ) can be solved exactly .",
    "the solution for the @xmath11 function is    @xmath40    it has thus the correct asymptotic properties ( see fig .",
    "it is regular at small @xmath16 and asymptotically approaches the free propagator at infinity ( @xmath41 ) , which can be formally achieved by the two ways : @xmath42 at fixed @xmath43 and/or by @xmath44 as well .",
    "let us note that the last limit is known as the pt one .",
    "for the dynamically generated quark mass function @xmath12 the exact solution is    @xmath45    where @xmath46 is an arbitrary constant of integration and @xmath47 is some constant momentum squared for the chiral limit case .",
    "it is regular at zero .",
    "in addition , it also has algebraic branch points at @xmath48 and at infinity ( at fixed @xmath49 , i.e. , when @xmath43 is fixed ) . as in the general ( nonchiral ) case ,",
    "these unphysical singularities are caused by the inevitable ghost contributions in the covariant gauges ( for general behavior of this solution see fig .",
    "as was mentioned above , @xmath50 automatically has a correct behavior at infinity ( it does not depend on the constant of integration , since it was specified in order to get regular at zero solution ) . in the pt limit ( @xmath44 )",
    ", the constant of the integration @xmath49 and the variable @xmath16 go to infinity uniformly ( @xmath51 ) , so the dynamically generated quark mass function ( 2.11 ) identically vanishes in this limit , in accordance with the vanishing current light quark mass in the chiral limit .",
    "obviously , we have to keep the constant of integration @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( 2.11 ) arbitrary but finite in order to obtain a regular at zero point solution .",
    "the problem is that if @xmath52 , then the solution ( 2.11 ) does not exist at all at any finite @xmath16 , in particular at @xmath53 .",
    "this is valid , of course , for the general solution ( 2.3 ) as well .",
    "let us formulate and develop now the calculation scheme , which gives the solution of the system ( 2.2 ) step by step in powers of the light nonzero current quark masses , as well as in the inverse powers of the heavy quark masses .",
    "for this purpose , it is much more convenient to start from the ground system itself , eqs .",
    "( 2.2 ) , rather than to investigate the general solution ( 2.3 ) . for this purpose ,",
    "let us rewrite the ground system ( 2.2 ) as follows :    @xmath54    as was mentioned above , we are interested in the solutions which are @xmath55 and asymptotically approach the free quark case at infinity . because of our parametrization of the quark propagator , its asymptotics have to be determined as follows ( euclidean signature ) : @xmath56 , and neglecting @xmath57 in the denominators for light quarks .",
    "the ground system ( 3.1 ) is very suitable for numerical calculations .",
    "let us now develop the above - mentioned analytical formalism , which makes it possible to find solution of the ground system ( 3.1 ) step by step in powers of the light ( @xmath58 ) nonzero current quark masses , the so - called chiral perturbation theory at the fundamental quark level .",
    "for this purpose it is convenient to present the quark propagator form factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 as follows :    @xmath61    where it is formally assumed that @xmath62 . substituting these expansions into the ground system ( 3.1 ) and omitting some tedious algebra , one obtains    @xmath63    and for @xmath64 , one obtains    @xmath65    where    @xmath66    is is obvious that the system ( 3.3 ) describes the ground system ( 3.1 ) in the chiral limit ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "as we already know , it can be solved exactly ( see below as well ) . the first nontrivial correction in powers of small @xmath68",
    "is determined by the following system , which follows from eqs .",
    "( 3.4 ) and ( 3.5 ) , and it is    @xmath69    where we omit the dependence on the argument @xmath16 , for simplicity . in the similar way can be found the system of equations to determine terms of order @xmath70 in the solution for the quark propagator and so on .",
    "let us present a general solution to the first of eqs .",
    "( 3.4 ) , which is    @xmath71    it is always regular at zero , since all @xmath72 are regular as well .",
    "the advantage of the developed chiral perturbation theory at the fundamental quark level is that each correction in the powers of small current quark masses is determined by the corresponding system of equations which can be formally solved exactly .",
    "let us write down the system of solutions approximating the light quark propagator up to first correction , i.e. ,    @xmath73    this system is    @xmath74    @xmath75    and    @xmath76    @xmath77.\\ ] ]    in physical applications we also need @xmath78 , so we have    @xmath79   + ... , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    and the relation between constants of integration @xmath49 and @xmath80 remains , in general , arbitrary .",
    "however , there exists a general restriction , namely @xmath81 and it should be real , which may lead to some bounds for the constants of integration , while @xmath82 always remains valid .      for heavy quarks ( @xmath83 )",
    "it makes sense to replace @xmath84 . in this case",
    "it is convenient to find solution for heavy quark form factors @xmath59 and @xmath60 as follows :    @xmath85    and for heavy quark masses it is formally assumed that @xmath86 , i.e. , the inverse powers are small . substituting these expansions into the first equation of the ground system ( 3.1 ) and omitting some tedious algebra , one finally obtains    @xmath87    and    @xmath88    in the same way , by equating terms at equal powers in the inverse of heavy quark masses , from second of the equations of the ground system ( 3.1 ) , one finally obtains    @xmath89    and    @xmath90    where @xmath91 are again given by eqs .",
    "( 3.5 ) . solving eqs .",
    "( 3.17 ) and taking into account eq . ( 3.15 ) , one obtains    @xmath92    so the final system to be solved further becomes    @xmath93    it is possible to show that all odd terms are simply zero , i.e. , @xmath94 .    the explicit solutions for a few first nonzero terms are    @xmath95    @xmath96    @xmath97    thus our solutions for the heavy quark form factors look like    @xmath98    where    @xmath99    and    @xmath100    where    @xmath101    summing up , one obtains    @xmath102    in terms of the euclidean dimensionless variables , the quark propagator is    @xmath103    using our solutions , obtained above , it can be written down as follows :    @xmath104    where @xmath105 is nothing else but the free quark propagator with the substitution @xmath106 , i.e. ,    @xmath107    since @xmath108 is of order @xmath109 , then eq . ( 3.30 ) , becomes    @xmath110    i.e. , it is reduced to the free quark propagator up to terms of order @xmath111 .",

    "we will show that the quark propagator to leading order ( up to terms of order @xmath2 ) in the inverse powers of the heavy quark mass will not depend on it , i.e. , it is a manifestly flavor independent to the leading order of this expansion . for this purpose , we must take into account that the argument @xmath16 , which is the dimensionless momentum of the heavy quark , contains itself the heavy quark mass @xmath1 .",
    "in other words , a standard heavy quark momentum decomposition should be used , namely    @xmath112    as well as    @xmath113    where @xmath114 is the four - velocity with @xmath115 ( euclidean signature ) .",

    "thus our propagator does not depend on @xmath1 to leading order in the heavy quark mass limit , @xmath124 , i.e. , in this limit it possesses the heavy quark flavor symmetry , indeed .",

    "our approach makes it possible to calculate physical observables from first principles .",
    "all results will depend only on the renormalized coupling constant ( which has the dimensions of mass ) and the corresponding constant of integration .",
    "a physically well - motivated scale - setting scheme is only needed to fix them .",
    "our general conclusion is that 2d covariant gauge qcd implies quark confinement and dynamical breakdown of chiral symmetry without explicitly involving some extra degrees of freedom .",
    "the only dynamical mechanism responsible for them , which can be thought of in 2d covariant gauge qcd , is the direct interaction of massless gluons @xcite .",
    "this interaction is a main dynamical effect not only in 2d qcd but in 4d qcd as well , i.e. , in qcd itself .",
    "however , to directly generalize the quark confinement mechanism of 2d covariant gauge qcd to 4d qcd is impossible .",
    "the problem is that in former theory the coupling constant , having the dimensions of mass , plays the role of a mass gap , which was introduced and discussed by jaffe and witten ( jw ) in ref .",
    "@xcite . in latter theory the coupling constant is dimensionless , and there is none of the characteristic scales in qcd lagrangian .",
    "if qcd confines then such a characteristic scale is very likely to exist , and it is not @xmath151 , of course , which can be considered as responsible for the nontrivial pt dynamics in qcd ( scale violation , asymptotic freedom ) . a possible way how to introduce a mass gap responsible for the nontrivial np dynamics in qcd has been described in ref .",
    "its possible relation to the above - mentiond jw mass gap is also discussed there .",
