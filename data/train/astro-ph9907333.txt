    "massive distant clusters of galaxies can be used to constrain models of cosmological structure formation ( e.g. peebles , daly & juszkiewicz 1989 ; arnaud 1992 ; oukbir & blanchard 1992 ; eke , cole & frenk 1996 ; viana & liddle 1996 ; bahcall , fan & cen 1997 ; donahue 1998 ; borgani 1999 ) .",
    "the mass function of clusters reflects the sizes and numbers of the original perturbations , and the _ evolution _ of the mass function depends sensitively on @xmath9 , the mean density of matter . in a critical universe with @xmath7 ,",
    "perturbation growth continues forever , while in a low - density universe ( @xmath10 ) , growth significantly decelerates once @xmath11 .",
    "the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia 1990 ; henry 1992 ) has proved cosmologically interesting because it contains several massive high - redshift clusters ( henry 1997 ; eke 1998 ; donahue 99  hereafter d99 ) .",
    "we report here our analysis of a complete , high - redshift sample of clusters of galaxies culled from the emss , including the most distant emss clusters ( d99 ) .",
    "we use maximum likelihood analysis to compare the unbinned temperature - redshift data with analytical predictions of cluster evolution from press - schechter models , normalized to two different low - z cluster samples ( henry & arnaud 1991 ; markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "section 2 briefly describes the model for cluster evolution ,  3 describes the cluster samples , and  4 describes the implementation of the maximum likelihood technique .",
    "section 5 discusses our results and their sensitivity to various assumptions , and  6 outlines the results of a bootstrap resampling of our cluster catalogs .",
    "section 7 summarizes our findings .",
    "the press - schechter formula ( press & schechter 1974 ) , as extended by lacey & cole ( 1993 ) , adquately predicts the evolution of the cluster mass function ( @xmath12 ) in numerical simulations ( e.g. eke , cole & frenk 1996 ( ecf ) ; borgani 1999 ; bryan & norman 1998 ) . to obtain predicted cluster temperature functions ( @xmath13 ) from this mass function we use a mass - temperature ( @xmath14 ) relation appropriate for all values of @xmath9 ( voit & donahue 1998 , 1999 ) .",
    "at @xmath15 we normalize this relation to the simulations of evrard ( 1996 ) .",
    "we will show in  5 that the @xmath14 relation of ecf yields similar results .    in this description of cluster evolution , the three main variables are the mean density of the universe @xmath9 , the slope @xmath16 of the initial density perturbation spectrum near the cluster scale , and @xmath17 , a parameter that reflects the abundance of virialized perturbations on a given mass scale at a particular moment in time . for a given @xmath9 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ,",
    "the number of clusters per unit steradian expected in a given redshift range is @xmath18 integrated over the relevant redshift and temperature ranges , where @xmath19 is a window function defined by the flux and redshift limits of a given sample and the luminosity - temperature relation ( see  4 ) .",
    "our fitting procedure compares three cluster samples each covering distinct redshift ranges to the model (  2 ) .",
    "the emss provided two samples of distant clusters . because the emss has multiple flux limits ( henry 1992 ) , it is equivalent to multiple surveys each with different flux limits and sky coverages . to compute the volumes associated with the emss samples , we correct the predicted flux of a cluster to that measured within a @xmath20 detection cell ( henry 1992 ) .",
    "the @xmath21 emss sample , described in d99 , consists of 5 emss clusters at @xmath21 ( gioia 1990 ; henry 1992 . )",
    "these are all of the emss clusters with 0.5 - 3.5 kev fluxes @xmath22 .",
    "( ms2053 may also belong in this sample , but at a flux limit below what is listed in henry 1992 . ) the @xmath2 sample is described in henry ( 1997 ) .",
    "d99 modified that sample slightly by revising the redshift of one cluster upwards to 0.54 ( ms1241 ) , leaving 9 clusters in the henry sample .",
    "the henry sample has already been used to constrain @xmath9 by eke ( 1998 ) and henry ( 1997 ) .",
    "this paper extends the previous analysis from @xmath23 to @xmath24 , at which the cluster evolution is expected to be much more dramatic .    to establish a baseline for assessing cluster evolution",
    ", we used two different low - z samples : the markevitch sample and the heao sample .",
    "the markevitch sample of clusters from the rosat all sky survey with @xmath1 ( markevitch 1998 ) , covers a sky area of 8.23 steradians to a 0.2 - 2.5 kev flux limit of @xmath25 .",
    "the heao cluster sample is also an all - sky sample ( henry & arnaud 1991 ) , with a 2 - 10 kev flux limit of @xmath26 . to compute the volumes available to these samples",
    "we assume that the detection techniques in both cases were sensitive to the total extended flux .",
    "we explore the consequences of our choice of low - redshift sample in  5 .",
    "to assess how well cosmological models fit the cluster temperature data , we adopt the maximum likelihood technique described by marshall ( 1983 ) .",
    "specifically , we minimize the maximum likelihood function : @xmath27 + \\ln [ \\frac{dv}{dz}(z_i ) ] ] +   2 \\sum_{k } \\int_0^\\infty dt    \\int_{z_{min , k}}^{z_{max , k}(t ) }   \\frac{dn}{dt } \\frac{dv}{dz } \\omega_k f(t , z ) dz\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the redshift and temperature of cluster @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the minimum redshift of sample @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the maximum redshift at which a cluster of temperature @xmath34 can be seen in sample @xmath32 .",
    "@xmath35 is the comoving volume per unit solid angle , and @xmath36 is the solid angle corresponding to sample @xmath32 . in practice , the temperature integral is calculated between 3 and 15 kev .",
    "only clusters with temperature greater than 3 kev are included in the analysis .",
    "intervals around the minimum @xmath37 are distributed like @xmath38 so differences in @xmath37 are similar to the familiar @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath33 values for our samples depend on the cluster luminosity - temperature ( @xmath40 ) relation .",
    "low redshift clusters of galaxies have a fairly well - defined @xmath40 relation ( e.g. david et al . 1993 ; markevitch 1998 ) that high - redshift clusters of galaxies seem to follow ( d99 ; mushotzky & scharf 1998 ) .",
    "this relationship has a finite dispersion which we handle in two ways .",
    "one method is to replace the @xmath40 relation with a line bounding the lower @xmath41 envelope in @xmath42 ( henry 1997 ) , explicitly compute @xmath43 for each flux limit , and set @xmath44 .",
    "the second method is to incorporate the dispersion relation into the a window function @xmath19 ( eke 1998 ) .",
    "we have done this calculation both ways , and both methods yield very similar results . since the window function seems to be the most realistic description of the data , we use it for our default analysis and the same dispersion as assumed in eke ( 1998 ) .",
    "we explore the effect of including evolution in the @xmath40 relation in  5 .",
    "we vary 3 parameters for our model to span a cube of parameter space : @xmath45 , spectral index @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "we compute a multidimensional matrix of @xmath37 for 25 temperatures between @xmath49 to 15 kev .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev @xmath40 relation from david ( 1993 ) defines the emss and heao volumes , appropriately k - corrected .",
    "the volume of the markevitch ( 1998 ) sample , our default low - z sample , is defined by its own @xmath40 relation .",
    "this procedure yields a best fit of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , corresponding to a @xmath53 when @xmath54 .",
    "we achieve a similar degree of correspondence between observed and predicted temperature functions for flat models when @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , corresponding to @xmath58 .",
    "figure 1 plots the observed temperature functions ( d99 ) and the theoretical temperature function corresponding to the best fit to the temperature and redshift data for @xmath59 .",
    "note that we fit the discrete , unbinned temperature - redshift data , not the binned temperature function .",
    "figure 2 shows that our @xmath60 confidence limits on @xmath9 exclude @xmath7 .",
    "our value for the best - fit @xmath9 is consistent with that derived for the low - redshift subset of our data by henry ( 1997 ) , eke ( 1998 ) , and viana & liddle ( 1999 ) .",
    "however , viana & liddle ( 1999 ) report less stringent constraints than the previous studies because they were more conservative about uncertainties in the low-@xmath61 normalization of the temperature function .",
    "the maximum likelihood method we use naturally accounts for the uncertainty of the low-@xmath61 determination of the normalization ; we investigate the use of somewhat different low-@xmath61 samples in the next section . because our sample extends to higher redshifts ,",
    "our 3@xmath62 confidence limits are considerably stronger than those found by earlier cluster studies .",
    "our best fit values for @xmath9 are fairly robust .",
    "this section briefly describes the sensitivity of @xmath9 to the assumptions in our model and procedure . results for various assumptions are listed in table 1 .    1 .   * changing the low - redshift sample . * if we use the updated heao sample ( henry & arnaud 1991 , with best - fit temperature updates provided by henry , private communication ) instead of the markevitch sample , we obtain @xmath63 rather than @xmath64 because of the somewhat lower normalization at @xmath15 .",
    "we also used the markevitch sample with uncorrected temperatures and a flatter low-@xmath61 @xmath40 relation ( markevitch 1998 ) , and obtained a somewhat lower best - fit value for @xmath9 , @xmath65 .",
    "2 .   * varying the @xmath14 relation . *",
    "we find our bounds on @xmath9 change little when we switch to the ecf ( 1996 ) @xmath14 relation .",
    "because the best - fit @xmath9 turns out to be @xmath66 , the unphysical behavior of the ecf @xmath14 relation at low @xmath67 and low @xmath61 is not a factor .",
    "( see voit & donahue 1999 for more details . )",
    "dispersion in the @xmath14 relation .",
    "* our default assumption was that the @xmath14 relation has a finite dispersion of 7% ( evrard 1997 ) . neglecting the dispersion results in a negligible difference in @xmath9 ; increasing the dispersion to 20% and using the ecf @xmath14 relation increases @xmath9 slightly to @xmath68 .",
    "dispersion in the @xmath14 relation scatters some of the more numerous low - mass clusters to higher temperatures , making the observed temperature function flatter , and somewhat enhancing the observed numbers of hot clusters relative to cool clusters . 4 .",
    "* evolution of the @xmath40 relation . *",
    "if we allow the normalization of the @xmath40 relation to evolve such that @xmath69 and @xmath70 , we find no significant differences in @xmath9 values .",
    "this null result is in contrast to similar exercises in modelling the evolution of the cluster luminosity function ( e.g. borgani 1999 ) or cluster number counts ( ebeling 1999 ) , where evolution of the @xmath40 relation in the appropriate direction ( @xmath71 ) allows models with larger @xmath9 ( @xmath72 ) to nearly fit .",
    "@xmath40 evolution only modestly affects the sample volume used to predict the distribution of cluster temperatures .",
    "5 .   * omitting ms1054 - 0321 .",
    "* ms1054 - 0321 , the hottest ( @xmath73 kev ) and most distant ( @xmath74 ) cluster in our sample ( donahue 1998 ) , may well be anomalous . however , omitting ms1054 - 0321",
    "had virtually no effect on the best fit @xmath9 .",
    "* missing high redshift clusters in the emss . * the emss could be incomplete due to the use of a single detect cell aperture , which could bias its cluster selection in favor of high central surface brightness even at high - z ( ebeling 1999 ; lewis 1999 ) . if the emss is missing clusters at higher redshift , the values for @xmath9 derived here are upper limits .",
    "7 .   * deviations from press - schechter orthodoxy . *",
    "some numerical simulations indicate that massive , high - z clusters might be more common than the standard ps formula predicts ( governato 1999 ; evrard , private communication ) .",
    "we have tested the effects of reducing the standard evolution of @xmath75 by a factor @xmath76 ( governato 1999 ) , and find that the best fit @xmath9 rises to @xmath77 .",
    "of all the systematic effects , this one has the largest effect on the best fit @xmath9 .",
    "even so , @xmath7 is barely allowed at the @xmath60 level .",
    "* a larger high - redshift sample .",
    "* we simulated the effect of tripling the size of the emss by tripling the assumed sky coverage of the emss and replicating the existing @xmath78 data pairs .",
    "tripling the number of known clusters with @xmath79 reduces the statistical uncertainty of @xmath9 by a factor of @xmath80 . because the uncertainty in the current estimate is now equal parts systematic and statistical , theoretical refinements will be needed if we wish to take full advantage of larger surveys .",
    "in order to investigate the effects of measurement uncertainties within our cluster @xmath78 catalogs , we generated bootstrap catalogs with re - sampled temperatures .",
    "for the emss clusters , we used the mean temperatures from gaussian fits to temperature probability distributions derived from the x - ray data ( d99 , table 4 ) .",
    "ten thousand boot - strap catalogs were generated for each of the three original samples , markevitch ( 1998 ) , henry ( 1997 ) , and d99 .",
    "the number of clusters in each catalog was predetermined from a poisson distribution based on the number of clusters in the original catalog .",
    "each set of data was then fit to obtain a best - fit @xmath9 , normalization , and slope , using all of the standard assumptions .",
    "out of 10,000 catalog combinations , we obtained a best fit @xmath81 for only 3 .",
    "these three catalog combinations were the ones for which the low - redshift catalog had a high number of clusters while the high - redshift cluster catalogs were nearly empty .",
    "we got very similar results when we repeated bootstrap re - sampling of the three catalogs while assuming temperature measurement uncertainties for the emss clusters that were half the original uncertainty .",
    "this similarity suggests that temperature measurement errors do not dominate the uncertainty in this method of estimating @xmath9 .",
    "we have used a maximum likelihood press - schechter analysis of the temperatures and redshifts of two high - z emss samples of clusters of galaxies and two low - z all - sky samples of clusters to constrain @xmath0 .",
    "we find a simultaneous best fit to the low - z markevitch ( 1998 ) sample , a moderate - z emss sample from henry ( 1997 ) , and a high - z emss sample ( d99 ) of @xmath4 for an open universe and @xmath5 for a flat universe , quoting statistical uncertainties only .",
    "our results are not very sensitive to the assumptions within our cluster evolution model , with systematic uncertainties @xmath6 .",
    "universes with @xmath7 are ruled out at greater than 99.7% ( @xmath8 ) confidence in the scenarios described here .",
    "we acknowledge the nasa grants nag5 - 3257 , nag5 - 6236 , nag5 - 3208 and nag5 - 2570 for partial support of this work .",
    "we benefitted greatly from exchanges with j. patrick henry in the development of the code and by his generous release of revised temperature data for the low - z henry & arnaud ( 1991 ) sample .",
