    "the interaction terms in many dynamical systems can be viewed as links in a graph , and it is interesting to explore new ways to study these systems by using graph theory . in our work , we discuss systems based on the signless laplacian of a graph , motivated by models arising in the study of viral capsids @xcite@xcite@xcite . the original idea of this model is due cermelli , indelicato and zappa @xcite , who worked with a viral capsid , i.e. , the `` head '' of a virus . inside the capsid",
    "is contained the rnam of the virus , and it opens in order to release its infective content .",
    "therefore , those dynamical systems become relevant to study . a rich literature on dynamical systems based on the laplacian exists , for instance in the study of the synchronisation problem or for harmonic coupled oscillators .",
    "the problem may seem similar , but these two matrices have completely different behaviours . for more information about the laplacian matrix and the synchronisation problem ,",
    "see for example @xcite@xcite .",
    "the main difference between our case and the laplacian is that the associated energy for the latter is not coercive : the asymptotic behaviour of the system involves large oscillations .",
    "+ given a graph , we define a linear dynamical system on it .",
    "each node represents a component of a vector field , while the links between nodes are the mutual influence in the potential function . to study the asymptotic behaviour of the system , we first characterise analytically the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the signless laplacian for some general classes of graphs , given the explicit form of the eigenvalue and eigenvectors",
    "then , we perform numerical simulations on more complex systems , based on large and random graphs . in order to study the connection between the behaviour of the system and the topology of the graph we try , using specifically designed graphs , to isolate the various characteristics that seem meaningful , in order to understand the role of nodes with different properties .",
    "we found that not only the degree of a node is important , but also the average degree of its first , second and third neighbourhoods .",
    "we defined a metric to take this property into account . using this distance",
    ", the simulations show a perfect match with the theoretical result and the expected behaviour .",
    "the idea is that there is a kind of rigidity : the more the nodes are connected ( the graph is `` rigid '' ) , the less they move .",
    "this property acts also locally : if just a few nodes are poorly connected , and the rest of the graph has a lot of links , they spread crazily while the other parts remain steady .",
    "then , we investigate also the importance of the clustering as a graph measure .",
    "it turns out to have some kind of significance .",
    "therefore , we use the previous metric to define a new one , which is able to include the information of the clustering . both measures are really valid to describe the behaviour of the system .",
    "given a graph @xmath0 of order @xmath1 with vertex set @xmath2 , edge set @xmath3 and adjacency matrix @xmath4 , consider a vector field @xmath5 whose components @xmath6 are scalar fields associated to the vertices of @xmath7 .",
    "+ the signless laplacian matrix of @xmath7 is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 @xmath10 is semidefinite positive , with non negative entries .",
    "+ we consider interactions among the nodes described by a potential function @xcite @xmath11 of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are real parameters , with @xmath15 and , at least at the beginning , @xmath16 .",
    "the associated gradient system has the form @xmath17 note that the system is linear and @xmath18 symmetric , i.e. , @xmath18 has got real eigenvalues . denoting by @xmath19 the eigenvalues of the dynamical system and",
    "@xmath20 the eigenvalues of the signless laplacian @xmath10 , ordered in descending order , we have @xmath21 if the largest eigenvalue of the system is negative , the system is stable , so we have the simple stability condition : @xmath22 then the system is stable , otherwise the system is unstable .",
    "we compute the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the signless laplacian for five classes of graphs : the complete graph on @xmath1 vertices @xmath23 , the complete bipartite graphs @xmath24 , the cycle @xmath25 , the path @xmath26 and the star @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath10-eigenvalues will be always denoted by @xmath20 , @xmath28 , and will be sorted in descending order @xmath29 .",
    "+ @xmath30 will represent the @xmath31-th @xmath1-root of the unit .",
    "recall that @xmath32 .",
    "further , we define @xmath33 .",
    "the table reports the @xmath10-eigenvalues and the @xmath10-eigenvectors for each of the five classes of graphs .",
    "-2,7 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the clustering of a node is the measure of the connections between the neighbours of a node , we expect it to have some role determining the value of the component in the principal eigenvector . on the contrary",
    ", it seemed to have no connection with the principal eigenvector ( see figure [ ba1 ] ) .",
    "then , for most of our analysis , this measure was calculated but rarely taken into account . to investigate the role of the clustering",
    ", we use the ba algorithm to generate a new graph with @xmath34 .",
    "the lowest value for the degree in this graph is five .",
    "then we add a new node to the graph and generate four new graphs connecting the newly introduced node to the four higher degree nodes of the network .",
    "the four hubs in the initial graph are connected together .",
    "thus , all the neighbours of the @xmath35 node are neighbours to each other , and so its clustering is @xmath36 .",
    "note that , when it is connected to only one node , the clustering value is zero by default . in figures",
    "[ nc ] @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 , we see that the node has the highest value in the eigenvector . on the other hand , in case @xmath40 the value in the eigenvector is almost negligible @xmath41 , even though it still has the lowest degree .",
    "then , also the clustering plays a certain role .",
    "however , for large graphs without trivial connection patterns , its role is marginal compared to that of the degree . from this",
    ", we can suppose that the clustering can be used to improve the rigidity measure we defined earlier .",
    "then , we define a new measure @xmath42 : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are respectively the clustering coefficient and the degree of node @xmath46 , while @xmath47 is an adjustable parameter . in this formula",
    "@xmath45 multiplies @xmath44 to differentiate between nodes that despite belonging to equally clustered groups does not have the same rigidity due to the different amount of links .",
    "cc +    using this new metric , we see ( figure [ rrtilde ] ) an improvement in the behaviour prediction . as before",
    ", the colour shows the value of the measure used , and the size of a node represents the degree of the node .",
    "the arrow shows the node whose value was higher in the eigenvector .",
    "we can see that both the metric are able to capture this fact .",
    "moreover , there is a tiny improvement using @xmath42 instead of @xmath48 .",
    "this is due to the information carried by the clustering , as we said above .",
    "+ summing up , those metric are both truly useful for studying the properties of the graph and of the system because they are able to discern which part of a graph are more able to move or spread and which not .",
    "in the first part of the work , we analysed the stability of a dynamical system defined on several classes of graphs .",
    "the general result is that the more connected the graph is , the stronger under perturbation the system is .",
    "keeping this in mind , in the second part of the work we tried to understand how exactly the connection properties influence the system , and also how we can measure of this connection properties .",
    "+ from the theoretical results , we know that a perturbation spreads in different ways on the path and on the complete graph , i.e. , on graphs with general low connectivity and on highly connected graphs . more precisely , if a node is connected with several others , and also those have a high connection rank , the perturbation is not going to have a huge impact . on the other hand ,",
    "if the node is not very well connected with other nodes , or if it is connected to a node which degree is low , then the perturbation is going to have great effects .",
    "when we performed the numerical simulations , we found a perfect accord with this expectation .",
    "in fact , through numerical simulations , we proved that if we place the system in a specific type of instability its state converges in the direction of the principal eigenvector .",
    "this encouraged us to study the connection between the features of this state and the structure of the graph . performing simulations on different types of large graphs , constructed in order to have specific characteristics",
    ", we showed that exists a connection between the topology of the nodes and their importance inside the principal eigenvector .",
    "our results give high relevance to the degree of a node , accompanied by the importance of the degree of its neighbours and the connections between them , carried out by the clustering .",
    "+ in this study is given a good account of the factors that lead a node to have a high value in the eigenvector .",
    "the relationship between the topology of the graph and its value inside the eigenvector , however , remains unknown .",
    "an analytical result that allows us to understand the importance of a node from the graph structure knowing its topological characteristics , it was not obtained .",
    "this probably depends on the fact that the behaviour of a complex graph can not be simplified over a certain limit , as we tried to do connecting linearly the topological properties of the graph with the spectral ones .",
    "+ since the behaviour of the system derives from a complex interplay of different characteristics , there is probably a more complex type of connection that has to be taken into account when we analyse the graph .",
    "there is probably a more complex type of connection that has to be taken into account when we analyse the graph .",
    "the behaviour of the system derives from a complex interplay of the different characteristics of the graph .",
