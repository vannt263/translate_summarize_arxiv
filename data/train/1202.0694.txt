    "understanding living cells at a systemic level is an increasingly important challenge in biology and medicine @xcite .",
    "regulatory interactions between intracellular molecular agents ( e.g. dna , rna , proteins , hormones , trace elements ) , form so - called _ genetic regulatory networks _ ( grn ) , which orchestrate gene expression and replication , coordinate metabolic activity , and cellular development , respond to changes in the environment , or stress .",
    "grn coordinate regulatory dynamics on all levels from cell - fate @xcite to stress response @xcite .",
    "qualitative understanding of grn topology is for instance obtained from promoter sequences @xcite , gene - expression profiling @xcite or protein - protein interactions ( proteome ) @xcite .",
    "however qualitative information on grn topology alone is insufficient to understand grn dynamics .",
    "it has been recognized that quantitative information is required to understand the complex dynamical properties of regulatory interactions in living cells @xcite , mainly because dynamics on interaction networks with identical topology still depends on the strength of interactions ( links ) between agents ( nodes ) .",
    "models of grn dynamics aid the task of understanding properties of grn at various levels of detail available in experimental data and therefore provide valuable tools for integrating information from different sources into unifying pictures and for reverse engineering grn from experimental data .",
    "any model should _ adequately _ reproduce grn dynamics and _ sufficiently _ exhibit systemic properties of the grn , including homeostasis , multi - stability , periodic dynamics , alternating activity , self - organized critical dynamics ( soc ) and differentiability",
    ".    _ homeostatic dynamics _ regulates the equilibrium concentration levels of agents , e.g. @xcite , _ multi - stability _ shows switching between multiple steady states @xcite .",
    "examples for _ periodic dynamics _ are e.g. the cell - cycle @xcite , circadian - clock @xcite , i@xmath0b - n@xmath0b signaling @xcite , her dynamics @xcite etc .",
    "some molecular agents show _ alternating activity _ , i.e. their concentrations alternate between being detectable ( on ) and below detection threshold ( off ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "_ self - organized critical _ ( soc ) dynamics corresponds to details of regulatory dynamics ensuring ( approximate ) stability within a fluctuating environment through various mechanisms of adaptation .",
    "finally the property of _ differentiability _ means that cells of multicellular organisms can differentiate into various cell - types ( liver , muscle , blood , kidney , cancer , ... ) .",
    "the differentiated cells possess identical grn but express distinguishable patterns of regulatory activity .",
    "the same grn therefore can be expressed in different _ modes _ so that some agents become expressed in one mode but not in another @xcite .",
    "recently it has been reported that both regulation of transcription and mrna decay rates ( i.e. the mrna turnover ) are necessary to understand experimentally observed expression values @xcite .",
    "moreover it has been demonstrated that decay rates of mrna are cell - type specific @xcite .",
    "analogously for proteins , where the dominant mechanism is the ubiquitin driven proteolyse in the proteasom @xcite , protein abundance and therefore their degradation has to be tightly controlled @xcite .",
    "also the abundance of proteins and whether certain proteins are produced or not is again cell - type specific @xcite .",
    "this indicates that decay - rates and their control play a crucial role in cell - differentiation .",
    "variable decay rates however and the property of differentiability are hardly ever considered in grn models where decay rates of agents are usually kept constant .",
    "understanding the effects of changes of decay rates of agents therefore is a crucial step towards a deeper understanding of grn dynamics and the role decay rates play in cell - differentiation .",
    "the grn is the set of all possible interactions of molecular reactions and bindings .",
    "the grn captures all possible features of cells and are responsible for the immense levels of adaptation characteristic to living systems .",
    "what happens when different cell - types express the same grn in alternative ways ? at any point in time only small subsets of the grn are active .",
    "any active subset of the grn leads to the expression of particular sets of molecules ( expression modes ) .",
    "the _ active regulatory network _ at time @xmath1 is the regulatory sub - network of the grn , governing the molecular ( auto - catalytic ) dynamics of all agents which exist at time @xmath1 .",
    "the set of existing molecules forms the _ active agent set _ at time @xmath1 .",
    "the active network changes over time and typical sequences of active sets represent what we call the _ expression modes _ of a specific cell - type and their cell - cycle .",
    "expression modes themselves can be modified , either locally as a reaction to an external signal , or fundamentally through further cell differentiation .",
    "active sets of molecules are transient and what is observed in experiments is a superposition of subsequent active sets , which we call the _ expressed set of agents _ and the regulatory interactions between the expressed agents the _ expressed regulatory network_. to find the property of differentiability in a regulatory network model therefore requires that one network is capable of producing different expression modes while perturbations ( external signal ) only modify active sets locally and the particular expression mode can be restored .",
    "the six dynamical properties we have listed above have been addressed with a variety of conceptually different models .",
    "the essence of all these models is that they try to capture the dynamics induced by positive and negative feed back loops within the grn .",
    "the choice of model depends largely on the type and resolution ( coarse graining ) of experimental data . at the single cell level cellular activity ( e.g. concentrations @xmath2 of biochemical agents @xmath3 )",
    "can be modeled by non - linear ( stochastic ) differential equations @xcite which can explain homeostasis , periodic and multi - stable behavior .",
    "the dynamics governed by a grn is given by a set of coupled non - linear differential equations @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a ( non - linear ) function capturing the grn .",
    "it depends on the vector of concentrations of all the possible @xmath6 molecular agents in a cell , @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the time derivative of the concentrations @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath5 can have stochastic components .",
    "analysis of such systems is often complicated by the interplay between fluctuations and non - linearities @xcite .",
    "differential equation models can be approximated by cellular automata , boolean or piecewise - linear models .",
    "the property of soc dynamics , or dynamics at the `` edge of chaos '' @xcite , has been studied mainly in the context of cellular automata and boolean models @xcite .",
    "soc dynamics was also discussed in continuous differential equation based models @xcite .",
    "boolean and piecewise - linear models share common origins in the work of glass and kauffman , @xcite , and have extensively been used for modeling and analyzing grn @xcite . for their superior properties in approximating non - linear systems ( in principle to any suitable precision ) piecewise - linear models also are applied in different disciplines , for instance for modeling highly non - linear electronic circuits @xcite .    in the context of grn both boolean and piecewise - linear models",
    "usually are used for describing non - linear dynamics with switch - like regulatory elements frequently observed in biological regulatory processes @xcite .",
    "such switches react if the concentration of an agent ( the signal ) crosses a specific threshold level . to model such switches in regulation networks of @xmath6 molecular agents with concentrations @xmath2 the space of concentrations @xmath9 is cut into segments defined by the threshold values where the concentration @xmath2 can trigger a regulatory switch .",
    "these segments are called _ regulatory domains _ ( e.g. @xcite ) . in each such domain eq .",
    "( [ nlde ] ) gets approximated by a linear equation of the form @xmath10 where the @xmath11 are production rates and @xmath12 are interaction matrices between agents . if @xmath13 , then @xmath14 promotes the production of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath15 , then @xmath14 suppresses @xmath3 . if @xmath16 @xmath14 has no influence on @xmath3",
    "the diagonal elements @xmath17 are _ decay rates _ , @xmath18 .",
    "non - linear effects purely come from concentration @xmath2 passing threshold levels , where the dynamics of @xmath19 switches from one to another regulatory domain with different values of @xmath20 and @xmath12 .",
    "equation ( [ linearisation ] ) is a slight generalization of the glass - kauffman plm , @xcite , where @xmath16 except for the ( usually ) fixed decay rates @xmath21 , so that only the production rates change with the regulatory domain .    given that the interaction matrix @xmath22 of the regulatory network is invertible ( which is almost certainly true for the biologically relevant range of connectivities of grn ) eq . ( [ linearisation ] )",
    "can be rewritten @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the solution of the equation @xmath25 .",
    "the fixed - point @xmath24 is stable ( unstable ) and @xmath2 will be attracted ( repelled ) by @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath24 is stable and @xmath27 for all @xmath3 then @xmath28 is a stationary solution of eq .",
    "( [ linearisation ] ) .",
    "not all models approximating nonlinear differential equation descriptions of grn are equally suited to capture all grn properties discussed above simultaneously depending on whether discrete ( boolean , cellular automata ) or smooth ( differential equation ) features dominate the model .",
    "however there exists a surprisingly simple class of models which exhibits _ all _ desired grn properties . here",
    "we present such a simple model that captures all of the above dynamical properties .",
    "we find that the alternating dynamics plays a key role for the stability of regulatory systems and for the formation of soc dynamics in particular @xcite .",
    "most importantly we are able to show that even unspecific control over decay rates , changing the magnitude of all decay rates simultaneously by a ( small ) factor , leads to `` cell differentiation '' , i.e. the same regulatory network enters different expression modes , displaying different sequences of active regulatory networks .",
    "we show that experimental facts , linking variations of decay rates observed between different cell - types of an organism to variations of the abundance of intra - cellular biochemical agents in these cell - types , correspond to ( a ) differences in the _ expressed _ genetic regulatory network , and ( b ) these differences can be controlled via decay rates of intracellular agents .",
    "in other words typical expression modes ( cyclical sequences of successive active sub - networks of the grn ) can be altered and switched by controlling decay rates .",
    "glass - kauffman systems , @xcite , produce positive concentrations @xmath29 for all times @xmath1 given positive initial conditions @xmath30 .",
    "this however makes it impossible to produce alternating activity of agents since zero - concentrations @xmath31 can not appear .",
    "therefore we have to generalize glass - kauffman systems to more general forms of invertible interaction matrices @xmath12 where the positivity of solutions of eq .",
    "( [ linearisation ] ) is not implicitly guaranteed , but where positivity ( non - negativity ) is ensured as a constraint to the system , @xmath32 this constraint alters the linear dynamics of eq .",
    "( [ linearisation ] ) in the following way .",
    "whenever a concentration @xmath2 becomes zero at time @xmath1 then @xmath33 remains zero for @xmath34 for as long as @xmath35 , according to eq .",

    "( [ linearisation ] ) again .",
    "agent @xmath3 is said to be _ active _ at time @xmath1 , if @xmath29 and _ inactive _ , if @xmath31 .",
    "the positivity constraint eq .",
    "( [ eq : pc ] ) implies the following consequences . at any point in time",
    "there will be a sub - set of agents with non - vanishing concentrations which we call the _ active set _ of agents .",
    "the remaining agents have zero concentration , and therefore do not actively influence the concentrations of any of the non - vanishing agents .",
    "there exist @xmath39 different active sets , i.e. @xmath39 combinations in which @xmath6 agents can be active or inactive .",
    "each active set can be uniquely identified by an index @xmath40 .",
    "in the course of time @xmath1 some agents will vanish while others re - appear , so that one effectively observes a sequence of sets of active agents @xmath41 @xmath42 being the initial active set .",
    "the active set @xmath43 switches to active set @xmath44 at time @xmath45 . in each time interval",
    "@xmath46 $ ] of duration @xmath47 it is thus possible to only consider the regulatory sub - network acting on the set of active agents @xmath44 .",
    "this sub - network is described by the part of the full interaction matrix @xmath12 , where @xmath3 and @xmath14 are restricted to the set of active agents @xmath44 .",
    "these sub - matrices we call _ active networks _ and denote them by @xmath48 . the concentration vector of active agents we call @xmath49 .",
    "active agents also `` feel '' a modified _ effective _ fixed point @xmath50 , such that finally for @xmath51 the concentrations of the active agents follow a linear equation @xmath52 we refer to such systems as _ sequentially linear _ systems .",
    "the attractiveness of this description arises through the fact that it becomes possible to understand the dynamics by considering the sequences of active networks @xmath53 which allows to analyze dynamical properties in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the active sub - matrices @xmath48 ( see materials and methods ) .",

    "we presented a model which de - composes the dynamics of molecular concentrations  governed by the full molecular regulatory networks  into a temporal sequence of active sub - networks .",
    "this novel type of model allows not only to reduce the vast complexity of the full regulatory network into sub - networks of managable size but further to approximate the complicated dynamics by linear methods .",
    "the intrinsic non - linearities in the system which lead to alternating dynamics in concentrations ( as found in countless experiments ) are absorbed into switching events , where the dynamics of one linear system switches to another one . in this view",
    "different cell types correspond to different sequences of active sub - networks over time .",
    "these sequentially linear models allow not only for the first time to describe all the relevant dynamical features of the gnr ( homeostasis , multi - stability , periodic dynamics , alternating activity , differentiability , and self - organized criticality ) , but also offers the handle to understand the role of molecular decay rates .",
    "the fact that sequentially linear dynamics properly models homeostasis , multi - stability and periodic behavior was shown in @xcite .",
    "here we have shown how self - organized criticality ( lyapunov exponent self - regulates to zero ) arises as a consequence of temporal balance of switching events .",
    "this requires agents to show alternating activity ( being repeatedly on and off ) , which is a natural property by construction of sequentially linear models , and which has posed an unresolved problem of previous models such as the glass - kauffman @xcite model and its many variants .",
    "the mechanism behind self - organized criticality is based on adaptive switching times which effectively lead to refocusing of perturbed dynamics onto the attractor of sequences of active sub - networks .",
    "such a temporal self - organization causes long time memory of perturbations in terms of phase - shifts of the otherwise unchanged periodic dynamics , causing the lyapunov exponent to become zero . in other words",
    "slight perturbations , e.g. noise , only cause time - shifts of the sequence of regulatory reactions but do not change the underlying sequence .",
    "perturbations are `` remembered '' by the system by non vanishing phase - shifts and the dynamics gets `` refocused '' onto the periodic attractor merely accumulating a time - shift .",
    "this has the consequence that the lyapunov exponent is zero and the system self - organizes its criticality by adapting switching - times .",
    "practically this means that a system balances the time it spends in its active sub networks with stable and unstable dynamics ( temporal balance ) .",
    "applying the sequentially linear model to the problem of cell - differentiation we demonstrate that different levels of decay rates are one to one related with transitions from one active sub - network sequence ( cell type ) to another .",
    "this might be a key ingredient to understand a series of recent experimental facts reported on the role of decay - rate regulation systems and the role of noise in cell differentiation @xcite .",
    "we found that by varying the decay rates only , while keeping the complete regulatory network fixed over time , substantially modifies the temporal organization of regulatory events .",
    "in particular the decay rate controls the number of expressed agents , the sequence of active sub - networks , and sometimes even the type of solution ( stable , stationary , periodic ) .",
    "the changes occur at critical levels of decay rates and changes can be drastic . for example we find situations where a 5% variation of the decay rate causes an approximate doubling of the number of expressed agents .",
    "this demonstrates that different expression modes , which distinguish different cell - types from each other , can be very efficiently obtained by controlling the decay rates of agents without altering any interactions between agents in the regulatory network , which is very costly in an evolutionary sense .",
