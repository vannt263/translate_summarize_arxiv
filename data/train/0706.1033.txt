    "among a dozen or so existing definitions of weak higher categories , the opetopic approach is one of the most intriguing , since it is based on a collection of ` shapes ' that had not previously been studied : the opetopes .",
    "opetopes are combinatorial structures parametrising higher - dimensional many - in / one - out operations , and can be seen as higher - dimensional generalisations of trees .",
    "they are important combinatorial structures on their own , ` as pervasive in higher - dimensional algebra as simplices are in geometry ' , according to leinster  @xcite .",
    "opetopes and opetopic higher categories were introduced by baez and dolan in the seminal paper  @xcite , and the theory has been developed further by hermida - makkai - power  @xcite , leinster  @xcite , cheng  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and others .",
    "it is in a sense a theory from scratch , compared to several other theories of higher categories which build on large bodies of preexisting machinery and experience , e.g.  simplicial methods .",
    "the full potential of the opetopic approach may depend on a deeper understanding of the combinatorics of opetopes .    at the conference on _ @xmath0-categories : foundations and applications _ at the i m a in minneapolis , june 2004 , much time was dedicated to opetopes , but it became clear that a concise and direct definition of opetopes was lacking , and that there was no practical way to represent higher - dimensional opetopes on the blackboard .",
    "in fact , there did not seem to exist a general method to represent concrete opetopes in any way , algebraic , graphical , or by machine .-",
    "opetope in [ ex-1 - 2 - 3 ] : @xmath1\\urcorner \\ulcorner\\ulcorner\\#\\urcorner\\ulcorner\\#\\urcorner",

    "the best definitions are very abstract and not very hands - on : e.g.  leinster s definition in terms of iterated free cartesian monads  @xcite , or the hermida - makkai - power  @xcite definition of opetopic sets ( there called multitopic sets ) , followed by a theorem that this category is a presheaf category , hence characterising a category of opetopes ( there called multitopes ) .    as to graphical representations of opetopes in low dimensions ,",
    "the current method is based on a polytope interpretation of opetopes ( which is at the origin of the terminology : the word ` opetope ' comes from ` operation ' and ` polytope ' ) .",
    "leinster  @xcite has constructed a geometric realisation functor which provides support for this interpretation , although the polytopes in general can not be piece - wise linear objects in euclidean space . moreover , geometrical objects in dimension higher than @xmath2 are inherently difficult to represent graphically , and currently one resorts to lego - like drawings in which the individual faces of the polytopes are drawn separately , with small arrows as a recipe to indicate how they are supposed to fit together .",
    "the goal of this paper is to come closer to the combinatorics .",
    "our initial idea was to represent an opetope as a tree with some circles , which we now call _",
    "constellations_. this works in dimension @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "[ dim4 ] below ) , but it does not seem to be sufficient to capture the possible opetopes in dimension @xmath4 and higher .",
    "pursuing the idea , what we eventually found was a representation in terms of a sequence of trees with circles , and in fact it is basically the notion of metatree originally proposed by baez and dolan .",
    "that notion was never really developed , though : in the original paper  @xcite the claim that metatrees could express opetopes was not really substantiated , and in the subsequent literature there seems to be no mention of the metatree notion .",
    "the presence of circles makes a conceptual difference , and it also reveals a certain shortcoming in the original notion of metatree , related to units ( cf .",
    "[ const v meta ] ) .",
    "we hasten to point out that our notion of opetope coincides with the notion due to leinster  @xcite ( cf .  the explicit comparison culminating in theorem  [ ours = leinsters ] ) , not with the original baez - dolan definition : we work consistently with non - planar trees , which means our opetopes are ` un - ordered ' like abstract geometric objects , whereas the original baez - dolan opetopes come equipped with an ordering of their faces . in our version ,",
    "the planar aspect is only a particular feature of low dimensional opetopes .",
    "while our opetopes agree with leinster s , the description we provide is completely elementary and does not even make reference to category theory .",
    "we think that our description can serve as the famous that was previously missing , and that it can provide a convenient tool for communicating opetopical ideas .",
    "we also indicate how our approach is well - suited for machine manipulation .",
    "opetopes were introduced to parametrise higher - dimensional substitution operations .",
    "surprisingly , opetopes arise also in another way , namely from computads and higher - dimensional pasting theory , and we wish to mention that a very different combinatorial approach has been developed in this setting by palm  @xcite .",
    "computad _ is a strict @xmath5-category which is dimension - wise free .",
    "this notion was devised by street  @xcite as a tool for describing higher - dimensional compositions in strict @xmath0-categories . in the works of johnson  @xcite and power  @xcite , @xcite , different combinatorial and topological representations of computads ( called pasting schemes ) were given , starting from bnabou s pasting diagrams for @xmath6-categories and the dual graphical language of string diagrams .",
    "the subtleties encountered are related with the fact that the category of computads is not a presheaf category .",
    "a computad is called _ many - to - one _ if the codomain of every indeterminate in dimension @xmath7 is itself an indeterminate ( in dimension @xmath8 ) .",
    "harnik , makkai and zawadowski  @xcite established an equivalence of categories between many - to - one computads and multitopic sets .",
    "in particular , the category of many - to - one computads _ is _ a presheaf category .",
    "palm  @xcite has given a purely combinatorial description of this presheaf category .",
    "he introduces a notion of _ dendrotopes _",
    ", certain decorated hasse diagrams , and shows that dendrotopic sets ( their presheaves ) are equivalent to many - to - one computads . hence , by the theorems of harnik - makkai - zawadowski and hermida - makkai - power , dendrotopes should correspond to opetopes .",
    "however , a direct combinatorial comparison has not been given at this time .",
    "let us briefly outline the organisation of the exposition . in the first section we give the definition of opetopes in a direct combinatorial way , without reference to category theory .",
    "the crucial ingredient is the correspondence between _ non - planar _ trees and nestings of circles : an opetope is merely a sequence of such correspondences , with an initial condition .",
    "we give the definition in two steps : first the elementary ` 5-minute definition ' with examples , then we develop the involved notions of trees and constellations more formally and compare with baez - dolan metatrees .",
    "it is possible to jump directly from the ` 5-minute definition ' to section  [ sec : calculus ] , where the same elementary and hands - on approach is pursued to describe in detail how to compute sources and targets of opetopes , and how to compose them .",
    "however , such a reading would ignore the theoretical justification for the definitions and constructions .",
    "in section  [ sec : poly ] we review some basic facts about polynomial functors , notably their graphical interpretation which is the key point to relate the formal constructions with explicit combinatorics .",
    "section  [ sec : bd ] forms the theoretical heart of this work : we give an easy account of the baez - dolan slice construction in the setting of polynomial monads . from the graphical description of polynomial functors",
    "we see that the baez - dolan construction is about certain decorated trees .",
    "the double baez - dolan construction gives trees decorated with trees , subject to complicated compatibility conditions .",
    "we show that these compatibility conditions are completely encoded by drawing circles in trees .",
    "iterating the baez - dolan construction involves the correspondence between trees and nestings , and it readily follows ( theorem  [ op = op ] ) that the opetopes defined in section  [ sec : opetopes ] arise precisely as types for the polynomial monads produced by iterating the baez - dolan construction , starting from the trivial monad .",
    "we compare the polynomial baez - dolan construction with leinster s version of the baez - dolan construction , and conclude ( theorem  [ ours = leinsters ] ) that our notion of opetope agrees with leinster s  @xcite .    in the short section  [ sec : stable ] ,",
    "we observe a suspension operation for opetopes , and define a notion of stable opetopes .",
    "the stable opetopes also form a polynomial monad , and we show this is the least fixpoint for the baez - dolan construction ( for pointed monads ) .    in section  [ sec : calculus ] , we show by way of examples how the calculus of opetopes works in practice : we are concerned with computing sources and target of opetopes , and with composing them . in the appendix",
    "we briefly describe a machine implementation of the ` calculus of opetopes ' based on xml , including a mechanism for automated graphical output .    acknowledgements .",
    "we are grateful to john baez and peter may for organising the very inspiring workshop in minneapolis , and to eugenia cheng and michael makkai for patiently telling us about opetopes at that occasion .",

    "null - dots represent nullary operations of the operads or polynomial monads of the baez - dolan construction  [ bd ] , and nullary operations do arise .",
    "therefore the baez - dolan metatrees seem to be insufficient to reflect the baez - dolan construction and to describe opetopes .",
    "our zoom complexes may be what baez and dolan really envisaged with the notion of metatree .",

    "the trees in baez - dolan metatrees are in fact combed .",
    "these artefacts come from working with symmetric operads .",
    "the effect on the definition of opetope is that each opetope comes equipped with an ordering of its faces .",
    "we work instead with non - planar trees and polynomial monads , and the resulting opetopes ( which agree with leinster s , cf .",

    "http://www.tdom.org/ ` ) for parsing and manipulating xml .",
    "there are among other things procedures for computing sources , targets , and compositions , and writing the results back to new xml files .",
    "these scripts can be run from the unix prompt , provided tcl and the tdom extension are available on the system .",
    "the script ` computeallfacets ` takes as argument the name of an opetope xml file , and computes all its faces , writing the resulting opetopes to separate xml files .",
    "the script ` glueonto ` takes three arguments : the bottom opetope ( name of xml file ) , the name of the gluing locus , and the top opetope ( as xml file ) .",
    "the result is written to a new xml file .",
    "precise instruction for installation and usage can be found in the readme file and manual pages accompanying the scripts .",
