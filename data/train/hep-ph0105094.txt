    "in addition , neutrino mixing and oscillations are the likely resolution of the famous solar neutrino puzzle@xcite . in the boson sector",
    ", the mixing of @xmath4 with @xmath5 via weak currents provided the first evidence of @xmath6 violation@xcite and the @xmath7 mixing plays an important role in determining the precise profile of a ckm @xcite unitary triangle @xcite in wolfenstein parameter space @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 @xmath1 mixing in the @xmath9 flavor group also provides a unique opportunity for testing qcd and the constituent quark model .",
    "furthermore , the particle mixing relations for both the fermion and boson case are believed to be related to the condensate structure of the vacuum .",
    "the non - trivial nature of the vacuum is expected to hold the answer to many of the most salient questions regarding confinement and the symmetry breaking mechanism .",
    "the importance of the fermion mixing transformations has recently prompted a fundamental examination of them from a quantum field theoretic perspective@xcite .",
    "a similar analysis in the bosonic sector has also been undertaken@xcite . however , more recent analysis@xcite on the fermion mixing indicated that the previous result@xcite based on the perturbative vacuum is only the approximation with respect to the exact one based on the nonperturbative ( flavor ) vacuum . in this work",
    ", we show that the same is true for the bosonic sector . upon the completion of our work",
    ", we notice that the same conclusion was also drawn in a recent literature @xcite . in our work , however , the orthogonality between mass and flavor vacua is shown in a straightforward algebraic method rather than solving a differential equation for the inner product of two vacua as presented in @xcite .",
    "as evidenced in the previous literatures @xcite the method of using a differential equation to prove the unitary inequivalence between the two fock spaces has been known for some time and our algebraic method is a new development in this respect .",
    "moreover , we analyze the structure of the nonperturbative flavor vacuum in a great detail contrasting to the fermion case .",
    "the details of flavor vacuum , its perturbative expansion in the mixing angle and also some clarifying remarks on the green function method and the arbitrary mass parametrization are summarized in the accompanying appendices .",
    "we begin in section ii with investigation of the vacuum structure using the relation between the base eigenstate and the physical mixed - eigenstate fields .",
    "we derive the representation for pontecorvo mixing transformation for boson case and explicitly calculate the flavor vacuum state structure in the quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "we then investigate the unitary inequivalence of the two fock spaces - one is the space of mass eigenstates and the other is the space of flavor eigenstates . in section iii ,",
    "the ladder operators are constructed in the mixed basis .",
    "these are used to derive time dependent oscillation formulas for @xmath10-boson states , @xmath11-boson states , and boson coherent states .",
    "consequences from the replacement of the perturbative vacuum by the exact nonperturbative ( flavor ) vacuum are demonstrated .",
    "section iv is devoted to study specific cases in our formalism , such as the @xmath8 @xmath1 system .",
    "we show the numerical differences between the two results : one from the perturbative vacuum and the other from the nonperturbative vacuum .",
    "conclusions and discussions follow in section v. in appendix a , we present a derivation of an explicit expression for the flavor vacuum operating the ladder operators of particle and antiparticle to the vacuum of mass eigenstates . in appendix",
    "b , we discuss the region of validity for a perturbative expansion of the flavor vacuum . in appendix c , we make some clarifying remarks on the green function method and the arbitrary mass parametrization discussed in recent literatures@xcite .",
    "we start our analysis by considering the pontecorvo mixing relationship @xcite for two fields : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the free fields with definite masses @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the interacting fields with definite flavors @xmath16 , @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the above mentioned relationship naturally arises by considering the mixing problem for the two quantum fields with the lagrangian of the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the free flavor - field lagrangians ( i.e. @xmath20 ) and @xmath21 is the coupling constant responsible for mixing .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the above lagrangian can be immediately diagonalized by the transformation given by eq .",
    "( [ transf ] ) with an appropriate choice of mixing angle @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the parameters of diagonalized lagrangian can then be expressed in terms of flavor - field masses ( @xmath23 ) and interaction constant ( @xmath21 ) ; i.e. @xmath24 and @xmath25    the free mass - fields @xmath13 can be written explicitly as usual : @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are respectively the particle and anti - particle ladder operators for the free mass - fields and they satisfy the standard equal - time commutation relationships : @xmath29&= & \\delta_{\\vec{k},\\vec{k}'}\\delta_{i , i ' } \\cr [ b_{\\vec{k}i},b_{\\vec{k}'i'}^{\\dag}]&= & \\delta_{\\vec{k},\\vec{k}'}\\delta_{i , i'}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "for the spin-0 case , free mass - field amplitudes @xmath32 and @xmath33 are just numbers , i.e. @xmath34 . the interacting flavor - fields given by eq.([transf ] ) are the solutions of the euler - lagrange equation for eq.([lagr ] ) and therefore can be completely determined in terms of the two free spin-0 fields given by eq.([field ] ) and the mixing angle @xmath22 .",
    "this , however , gives rise to highly nontrivial relationship between the fock - space of free - fields and that of interacting fields . to build the fock space of flavor - eigenstates we consider the representation of the transformation consistent with eq.([transf ] ) in the fock space of mass - eigenstates .",
    "using the baker - hausdorff lemma , we can write the generator of this transformation as @xmath35 so that eq.([transf ] ) can be written in the form : @xmath36 with the transformation operator given by @xmath37 the similarity transformation given by eq.([tr1 ] ) relates the free field operators @xmath13 to the interacting fields @xmath15 .",
    "these relationships can be obtained from the requirement of the inner product conservation @xmath38 where a linear transformation of state vector according to @xmath39 relates the two hilbert spaces:_i.e . _",
    "mass - eigenstate space @xmath40 and flavor - eigenstate space @xmath41 .",
    "the transformation given by eq.([tr1 ] ) can also be viewed as the `` rotation '' of basis in the hilbert space of quantum states diagonalizing the bilinear lagrangian given by eq.([lagr ] ) .",
    "the operator @xmath42 can then be written in terms of ladder operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 as follows : @xmath43 where we denote @xmath44 and @xmath45 . here",
    "@xmath46 . from eq.([gener ] ) we note that eq.([tr1 ] ) makes each cluster @xmath47 , defined by linear superposition of operators @xmath48 , transform into itself , i.e. @xmath49 . the same can be said about its hermitian conjugate @xmath50 .",
    "this means that we can consider the transformation given by eq.([tr1 ] ) within each cluster with a specific momentum @xmath51 : @xmath52 thus , the total transformation is given by @xmath53 .",
    "it is also convenient to express @xmath54 as @xmath55 with the operator @xmath56 defined by @xmath57 where the commutation relation @xmath58=1 $ ] is satisfied between @xmath59 and @xmath60 just the same way as the particle creation and annihilation operators satisfy the commutation relations . with the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , we can directly apply eq.([gen ] ) to the mass - eigenstate vacuum and obtain @xmath61 where @xmath62 are the generalized binomial coefficients that can be found after appropriate orderings of @xmath63 and @xmath64 are carried out . in the expression given by eq.([vacpert ] ) , one can treat the operators @xmath56 ( @xmath65 ) as the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the vacuum fluctuation .    for simplicity",
    "we now suppress the momentum notation in the ladder operators and take the flavor vacuum state in the most general form @xmath66 applying the flavor annihilation operators to this vacuum , we obtain an infinite number of coupled linear equations for the coefficients @xmath67 and solve these equations in appendix a. as shown in appendix a , we find @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the normalization factor to be fixed by @xmath70 and the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 are given by @xmath73 here , we note that the coefficients @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( see eq.([zdefs ] ) ) can be written as @xmath74 where @xmath75 thus , the flavor vacuum state given by eq.([theta - vacuum ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath76 this result can be further reduced as @xmath77 by defining new ladder operators : @xmath78 where it is easy to check that @xmath79=x^2+y^2=1 $ ] , @xmath80=1 $ ] , @xmath81=0 $ ] .",
    "now , it is possible to compute directly the value of @xmath82 , because @xmath83 and the flavor vacuum is normalized to be one,_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath84 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath85 we see that the flavor vacuum state indeed exists in the fock space of mass - eigenstates and the normalization factor @xmath82 is finite but less than one for any value of @xmath86 in the exact vacuum treatment .",
    "the same has been obtained in ref.@xcite solving a differential equation of @xmath87 .",
    "while such method of derivation using a differential equation has been known for some time@xcite , our algebraic method presented in this work is a new development .",
    "this proves then the unitary inequivalence between the two fock spaces of mass and flavor in the infinite volume limit following the procedure discussed in ref.@xcite : @xmath88 for any time . while we agree with ref.@xcite on the point that only the infinite volume limit can warrant the unitary inequivalence even in the boson case",
    ", we note that the perturbative expansion of the exact vacuum in the boson case is dramatically different from the case of fermion .",
    "although the normalization factor @xmath82 is a finite function for all values of @xmath89 , we observe that this expression given by eq.([norm - factor ] ) has singularity on the complex plane at @xmath90 .",
    "this is in a remarkable difference from the fermion case where the corresponding result @xmath91 does nt have any singularity on the complex plane .",
    "thus , the flavor vacuum @xmath92 in terms of series in @xmath93 shall have a critical point and this would result in the divergence of the taylor series expansion for @xmath94 in powers of @xmath22 because such expansion only makes sense for small @xmath22 values . as we explicitly show in appendix b , the series given by eq.([vacpert ] ) is indeed divergent in the region @xmath95 .",
    "such divergence does nt occur in the fermion case .",
    "we also present some clarifying remarks in appendix c regarding on the green function method and the aribitrary mass parametrization discussed in the previous literatures@xcite .",
    "in the previous section , we have built the representation of the mixing transformation given by eq.([transf ] ) in the operator space of @xmath13 , where the action of mixing is given by the similarity transformation given by eq.([tr1 ] ) .",
    "we also considered the representation defined by operating @xmath96 in the fock space and showed the unitary inequivalence between the two ( mixed and unmixed ) fock spaces in the infinite volume limit .",
    "let us now further investigate these representations to come up with physically measurable quantities .",
    "the fields @xmath13 are defined by a superposition of ladder operators @xmath97 and @xmath98 that form the basis in a linear hilbert space of mass eigenstate fields . using eqs.([field ] ) and ( [ tr1 ] ) , one can immediately obtain annihilation operators for the mixed ( flavor ) fields that are consistent with the pontecorvo mixing relationship ; @xmath99 this is also consistent with the definition of flavor vacuum as the lowest energy state,_i.e . _",
    "@xmath100 where @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the hamiltonians of mixed - fields and unmixed - fields , respectively .",
    "straightforward application of baker - hausdorff lemma to eq.([annihilation ] ) yields : @xmath103 it is also not difficult to reverse eq.([ladden ] ) in order to obtain how the mass - eigenstate ladder operators are expressed in terms of flavor ones . using the above relationships we can also find the time dependence of the flavor - eigenstate ladder operators in the heisenberg picture since the time evolution of mass - eigenstate ladder operators are given by : @xmath104 in particular , after introducing more compact notation @xmath105",
    "we find @xmath106 from which we can also obtain the -time commutation relationships : @xmath107&=&[b_{-\\alpha},b_{-\\alpha t}^{\\dag } ] = c^2e^{i\\epsilon_{1}t}+s_{+}^2 e^{i\\epsilon_{2}t}-s_{-}^2e^{-i\\epsilon_{2}t}=a_{\\alpha\\alpha},\\cr [ a_{\\beta},a_{\\beta t}^{\\dag}]&=&[b_{-\\beta},b_{-\\beta t}^{\\dag } ] = c^2e^{i\\epsilon_{2}t}+s_{+}^2 e^{i\\epsilon_{1}t}-s_{-}^2e^{-i\\epsilon_{1}t}=a_{\\beta\\beta},\\cr [ a_{\\beta},a_{\\alpha t}^{\\dag}]&=&[a_{\\alpha},a_{\\beta t}^{\\dag}]= [ b_{-\\beta},b_{-\\alpha t}^{\\dag}]\\cr & = & [ b_{-\\alpha},b_{-\\beta t}^{\\dag}]=c s_{+}\\big(e^{i\\epsilon_{2}t}-e^{i\\epsilon_{1}t}\\big ) = a_{\\beta\\alpha},\\cr [ b_{-\\beta},a_{\\alpha t}]&=&[a_{\\beta},b_{-\\alpha t}]=-[b_{-\\alpha},a_{\\beta t}]^{*}\\cr & = & -[a_{\\alpha},b_{-\\beta t}]^{*}= c s_{-}\\big(e^{i\\epsilon_{2}t}-e^{-i\\epsilon_{1}t}\\big)= a_{\\bar{\\beta}\\alpha},\\cr [ b_{-\\alpha},a_{\\alpha t}]&=&[a_{\\alpha},b_{-\\alpha t}]=s_{+}s_{-}\\big(e^{i\\epsilon_{2}t}-e^{-i\\epsilon_{2}t}\\big)= a_{\\bar{\\alpha}\\alpha},\\cr [ b_{-\\beta},a_{\\beta t}]&=&[a_{\\beta},b_{-\\beta t}]=s_{+}s_{- } \\big(e^{-i\\epsilon_{1}t}-e^{i\\epsilon_{1}t}\\big)=a_{\\bar{\\beta}\\beta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] all other commutators are either zeros or can be expressed in terms of the above ones .",
    "eqs.([ladden]),([laddentime]),([commtime ] ) in fact define all the dynamics of pontecorvo mixing for two quantum fields . to show how",
    "these relationships can be used to calculate the dynamical parameters of the mixed ( interacting ) fields , one can consider the time evolution of cluster @xmath47 defined in section ii .",
    "as discussed in section ii , however , this cluster is invariant under the @xmath96 transformation .",
    "thus , we can consider @xmath47 with a particular @xmath51 independently from all other momentum values .",
    "we now calculate the number of particles with a definite mass condensed in the flavor vacuum state @xmath108 .",
    "let s consider the condensation of the particle with a definite mass , for example @xmath109 . using the inverse relation of eq.([ladden ] ) : @xmath110 we can get @xmath111 one can show that the same result is true for @xmath112 . thus , the condensate density of particles with a definite mass in the flavor vacuum is given by : @xmath113 apparently the condensate densities for particles with definite flavor in the mass vacuum , _ i.e. _ @xmath114 , are also given by @xmath115 .",
    "let us now consider the number of particles with a definite flavor in the flavor vacuum , for example @xmath116 . using eq.([laddentime ] ) , one can easily show that @xmath117 and thus @xmath118 similarly , we get for the @xmath17-particles @xmath119 we see that the number of particles with a definite flavor in the flavor vacuum is indeed not zero .",
    "this is due to the fact that flavor vacuum is not an energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian @xmath101 and changes with the time translation producing and destroying coherently virtual particle / antiparticle pairs .",
    "it shows a significant difference from the ordinary quantum mechanical treatment without considerating the vacuum effect , which yields @xmath120 for any time .",
    "we emphasize that our flavor vacuum here is not perturbative but exact .",
    "this is different from the approach , where mass eigenstate vacuum @xmath121 is used instead of the flavor vacuum to generate a flavor eigenstate,_e.g .",
    "_ @xmath122 .",
    "if the flavor vacuum @xmath123 was replaced by the mass vacuum @xmath121 , then we would have obtained @xmath124 instead of eq.([condensate ] ) . as discussed above in the exact vacuum treatment , the mass eigenstate vacuum",
    "is not annihilated by @xmath125 operators .",
    "indeed the term proportional to @xmath126 remains in the creation / annihilation operators , so that the accuracy in the order of @xmath127 can be expected from the results of exact vacuum approach compare to the perturbative vacuum approximation .",
    "the densities of vacuum condensation for antiparticles @xmath128 are obtained same as the densities for the corresponding particles , i.e. @xmath129 given by eqs.([condensate]),([flavcondensate ] ) and ( [ flavcondensate1 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the flavor oscillations in time for a single particle with flavor @xmath16 and momentum @xmath51 . in the heisenberg picture ,",
    "the average number of particles with flavor @xmath130 or @xmath17 in the flavor state @xmath131 is given by : @xmath132 in eq.([eqq1 ] ) , we note that we use the flavor vacuum to obtain exact result for the flavor oscillations .",
    "later , in section iv , we numerically compare the exact result with the previous approximate result@xcite . using eqs.([ladden]),([laddentime]),([commtime ] ) , we directly apply the standard quantum field theoretic method . since the flavor vacuum is annihilated by @xmath125 , we move @xmath133 in eq.([eqq1 ] ) to the most right position and @xmath134 to the most left position to annihilate the flavor vacuum .",

    "it contains oscillating contributions both from the @xmath139 conversion and from the virtual pair creation in a dynamically `` rotating '' flavor vacuum .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , the @xmath139 conversion process generates the term proportional to @xmath140 . the terms involving @xmath141-frequencies in eq.([n_time ] )",
    "are , however , related to the creation of virtual pairs .",
    "for example , the virtual pair creation violates energy conservation within the uncertainty time,_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath142 ( in our units @xmath143 ) and thus both creation and annihilation of , let s say , ( @xmath144 ) virtual pair must occur within @xmath145 time interval .",
    "thus , the terms in eq.([n_time ] ) involving @xmath141-frequencies can be related to the creation of different types of virtual pairs , while the terms involving @xmath146 is related to the actual @xmath139 conversion .    using eq.([n_time ] ) , we can also calculate the expectation value of the flavor charge operator defined by @xmath147 ; @xmath148 or with the conventional parameters , @xmath149 from this result , one can also see that there is an additional term proportional to @xmath150 to the usual pontecorvo formula .",
    "as discussed above , the origin of this term can be understood as a contribution from the virtual pair creation in `` rotating '' vacuum .",
    "the correction term is of the order of @xmath127 . as noted earlier",
    ", this may give a reason why it has been found neither in an ordinary quantum mechanical treatment nor in the approximate qft treatment based on a perturbative vacuum .",
    "we also calculate the time evolution of coherent state for the two mixed quantum fields .",
    "coherent state has the form @xmath151 extending the above calculation for a single particle , it is not so difficult to verify that for the state containing @xmath11 particles with flavor @xmath16 can be given by @xmath152 besides @xmath153 which is simply @xmath11 times the probability of @xmath154 transition , we see in eq.([n - alpha ] ) that the condensate contribution is present adding the density of @xmath16 particles from `` rotating '' vacuum .",
    "applying this result directly to the coherent state expansion , we obtain the following expectation values of the number operator @xmath155 in the coherent state @xmath156 : @xmath157 thus , the expectation values of the flavor charge operator @xmath158 turn out to be @xmath159 as we can see in eq.([coherent - charge ] ) , the vacuum contributions @xmath160 are removed from the flavor charge expectation values and the results for the coherent state are simply @xmath161 times the expectation values of the flavor charge for the single particle state .",
    "we now apply the results for time evolution of two mixing boson fields to the analysis of @xmath162 mixing system .",
    "the masses are taken to be 549 mev and 958 mev , respectively , and of course in the particle rest frame the energies in our formulas reduce to the masses .",
    "the phenomenologically allowed mixing angle ( @xmath163 ) range of the @xmath164 system is given between @xmath165 and @xmath166@xcite , where the mixing angle @xmath163 is defined by eq.(36 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "this angle represents the breaking of the su(3 ) symmetry , the eigenstates of which are already rotated @xmath167 from @xmath168 and @xmath169 to @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "thus , our mixing angle is defined by @xmath172 .",
    "recent analysis of the @xmath164 mixing angle using a constituent quark model based on the fock states quantized on the light - front can be found in ref.@xcite and the references therein .",
    "the optimal value found for @xmath163 was around @xmath173 and thus @xmath174 .",
    "we use these values in eqs.([n_time ] ) and ( [ q_time ] ) ( or equivalently ( [ resfin ] ) ) to determine the evolution of definite flavor particle number and charge .    in fig.[figc1 ] , we present both @xmath175 ( thick solid line ) and @xmath176 ( dotted line ) as a function of time when the particle momentum is given by @xmath177 gev . for a comparison , we also show the previous approximate result ( thin solid line ) based on the perturbative vacuum@xcite corresponding to these quantities noting that @xmath178 ) and ( [ q_time ] ) . as we shown in fig.[figc1 ] , the population density @xmath175 ( thick solid line ) is completely distorted due to the interaction with the nonperturbative vacuum while the sinusoidal pontecorvo result ( thin solid line ) is obtained for the approximate perturbative vacuum treatment .",
    "we see the large deviation up to @xmath179 in @xmath175 .",
    "however , one can not see the same level of deviation in @xmath176 and the previous result@xcite based on the perturbative vacuum seems to be a good approximation for the description of flavor charge oscillations modulo the accuracy of order @xmath127 .",
    "more details of our results on the time evolution of the particle number with the momentum @xmath177 gev are shown in fig.[fign2 ] , where the thick solid and dashed lines are @xmath175 and @xmath180 , respectively , and the thin solid and dotted lines are respectively the antiparticle contributions of @xmath181 and @xmath182 ) . from the initial moment of time",
    "the population of both @xmath16-particles ( thick solid line ) and @xmath17-particles ( thick dashed line ) increases .",
    "although the increase of number of @xmath17-particles in system is well understood due to @xmath139 conversion , the initial increase of @xmath16-population is quite unexpected and caused by @xmath183 production from vacuum .",
    "the contribution from this process however is rather fast so that the general tendency of exchanging between @xmath16 and @xmath17 particle states can also be seen quite well . in fig.[fign2 ] , we also see the oscillations of the antiparticle number in the system .",
    "this effect is given in the order of @xmath184 and usually is absent in an approximate qft treatment .",
    "this is entirely a qft effect which can not be obtained within the framework of quantum mechanics . in qft , besides the beams of @xmath16 and @xmath17 particles moving in @xmath51 direction , we necessarily have antiparticle beam traveling in the opposite direction .",
    "the population density in this beam is correlated with particle - beam so that the total flavor is preserved .",
    "the existence of beam is caused by `` dynamically rotating '' vacuum disturbance at the initial time of @xmath16-particle emerging .",
    "one should also note that the existence of `` recoil ''",
    "antiparticle beam is preserved in the more general wave - packet qft treatment of mixing problem .",
    "thus , the mixed particle of definite flavor not only produces the usual oscillation of population density in time ( or space@xcite ) but also is accompanied by emitting the beam of antiparticles traveling in the direction opposite to the beam of particles .",
    "these effects are in principle testable in the experiments .    in fig.[figq1 ]",
    ", we also plot more details on the time dependence of flavor charge expectation value with the same momentum @xmath177 gev .",
    "the thick solid and dashed lines are @xmath176 and @xmath185 , respectively .",
    "one can see that they exhibit mainly the simple periodic structure similar to the approximate qft - results @xcite and only slightly distorted due to interaction with vacuum .",
    "the amount of distortion is of @xmath184 order , _",
    "i.e. _ about 10% for this case .",
    "interesting feature is however presence of the regions where flavor charge of given sort of particles change sign which means that antiparticles outnumber the particles .",
    "the process can be physically understood as result of @xmath183 production when number of @xmath16-particles is small due to @xmath139 transition .",
    "it is also interesting and experimentally testable that the efficiency of conversion processes and the flavor - vacuum disturbance depend essentially on the energy of original particle .",
    "the dependence is effective to the relativistic mass of particles so that the qft - mixing effects are decreasing with the energy increase of flavor - particle .",
    "the distribution of intensity for simple quantum mechanical mixing and qft - mixing is given by the relationship of amplitudes @xmath186 , @xmath187 which determine the intensity of @xmath188 and @xmath189 terms in @xmath133 ( see eq.([ladden ] ) ) .",
    "in fig.[figg1 ] , we plot their dependence on momentum of emitted @xmath16 particle . as we can see in fig.[figg1 ] , @xmath190 amplitude falls down as @xmath191 increases and goes to 2 as @xmath192 .",
    "in this limit , @xmath190 defines mixing due to a simple rotation between @xmath193 and @xmath188 states .",
    "since it can be successfully computed within the framework of quantum mechanics , it gives the usual pontecorvo formula with only one oscillatory term . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath194 appears with an antiparticle creation operator and describe bogoliubov rotation between @xmath193 and @xmath195 states .",
    "this term is also responsible for @xmath196 high frequency term and antiparticle beam creation . as we see in fig.[figg1 ] , it decreases as @xmath192 and the mass difference becomes washed out by the relativistic gain of mass .",
    "this also means that at ultrarelativistic limit the qft - mixing effects vanish so that the simple pontecorvo formula is restored for flavor - oscillation .    to demonstrate the energy dependence , we show in fig.[fign1 ] the plot of population densities evolving with time for the larger momentum @xmath197 gev .",
    "the line assignments are same as shown in fig.[fign2 ] . as easily seen in fig.[fign1 ] , the intensity of antiparticle beam decreases dramatically to about 10% ( in contrast to 20 - 40% in fig.[fign2 ] ) of initial intensity .",
    "the initial increase in the population density fluctuation in particle beams also reduces even though the quantum mechanical simple oscillations with @xmath198 frequency are still visibly distorted .",
    "two beams nevertheless demonstrate strong correlation of the same kind as correlation in quantum mechanical epr - paradox problem so that total flavor charge is preserved as it should be .",
    "it is also noticeable that there exist moments of time when the antiparticle outnumbers the particle of the same sort thus producing a negative flavor charge as shown in fig.[figq1 ] .",
    "the non - trivial scalar and pseudoscalar meson mixing effects may be understood by the condensation of corresponding flavor states in the vacuum@xcite .",
    "we have now extended the analysis replacing the perturbative vacuum to the nonperturbative ( flavor ) vacuum .",
    "central to this analysis is the interplay between the base ( unmixed ) fock space and the physical fock space .",
    "their nontrivial relationship gives rise to the mixing and oscillation phenomena .",
    "while the similar quantum field theoretic formulation was presented for the fermion mixing @xcite , as well as boson mixing@xcite , our analysis differs in the derivation of the normalization factor @xmath82 given by eq.([norm - factor ] ) which is crucial to show the unitary inequivalence between the mass vacuum and the flavor vacuum .",
    "we presented a new algebraic method which is distinct from the conventional method of using a differential equation for @xmath82 .",
    "while the unitary inequivalence occurs only in the infinite volume limit even for the boson case as discussed in ref.@xcite , we find an intrinsic difference between the fermion and boson cases . as shown in this work , the normalization factor @xmath82 for the boson given by eq.([norm - factor ] ) has a singularity on the complex plane at @xmath199 while the corresponding result for the fermion does nt have any singularity . as we summarized in appendix b",
    ", this singularity corresponds to the divergence of the taylor series expansion in powers of @xmath22 for the region @xmath200 .",
    "for both the boson and fermion cases , however , the non - trivial observable mixing phenomena can not occur unless there is both a nonzero mixing angle and also a nonzero mass ( energy ) difference between the two physically measurable mixed states .",
    "dramatic small oscillations due to the virtual pair creation occur in the exact vacuum analysis , while only a simple sinusoidal pontecorvo oscillations occur in the perturbative vacuum treatment .",
    "some clarifying remarks on the green function method and the arbitrary mass parametrization discussed in the previous literatures@xcite are also summarized in appendix c.    as a physical application , we used our formulation to analyze the @xmath8 @xmath1 system and found that the measured mixing angle and mass difference between @xmath8 and @xmath1 can be related to the non - trivial flavor condensation in the vacuum .",
    "however , more fundamental questions such as the translation of the condensation in hadronic degrees of freedom to those in quark and gluon degrees of freedom remains unanswered .",
    "the answer to this question depends on the dynamics responsible for the confinement of quark and gluon degrees of freedom and perhaps has to rely on lattice qcd and/or some phenomenological model that accommodates strongly interacting qcd . further investigation along",
    "this line is underway .",
    "also , it would be interesting to look at the mixing transformations between gauge vector bosons governed by the weinberg angle in the electroweak theory as well as vector mesons such as the @xmath201 and @xmath202 .",
    "while the statistics are the same as the scalar and pseudoscalar bosons considered here , there will be additional spin dependent interactions which complicate the analysis .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize the procedure for deriving eq.([theta - vacuum ] ) that describes a structure of the flavor vacuum . we first define flavor vacuum in terms of mass - eigenstates as the most general linear superposition of the form :",
    "@xmath203 then , using the definition of flavor vacuum : @xmath204 and explicit expression for the ladder operators given by eq.([ladden ] ) , one can derive an infinite set of linear equations for @xmath205 coefficients : @xmath206 to solve this infinite set of equations , we can express @xmath207 in terms of @xmath208 so that we step by step reduce the @xmath209 number of particles . denoting @xmath210 ( notation for @xmath211",
    "is chosen in correspondence to the index of particle type ) , we can write this relationship as @xmath212 one also can write this in a symbolic manner introducing a kind of shifting operators with definition @xmath213 with the use of eq.([kmoperators ] ) , eq.([cviaz ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath214 and finally it can be written as @xmath215 one should note that , since total momentum of vacuum state should be zero , @xmath216 unless @xmath217 . therefore , in eq.([finalsum ] ) only terms with ( @xmath218 ) must survive and from eq.([zdef ] ) we get @xmath219 to find : @xmath220 where @xmath221 using a direct expansion , one can also verify that the above expression for vacuum state is equivalent to @xmath222",
    "in this appendix , we try to directly estimate the norm of the flavor vacuum state @xmath223 using the perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath22 and show that the perturbative calculation of the flavor vacuum state is indeed impossible for large @xmath224 .",
    "truncating the series for @xmath225 to the @xmath226 terms , we have the term with the largest number of particle coming from @xmath227 in the @xmath228 .",
    "thus , the truncated series of @xmath229 can be written as @xmath230 where @xmath231 denotes all terms with the total number of particles and antiparticles less than @xmath232 .",
    "for the norm of above expression we can write then : @xmath233 thus when @xmath234 the norm of the @xmath235 is growing as the number of terms kept in expansion of the @xmath236 grows and therefore the transformation operator @xmath237 is not well defined operator in the mass - eigenstates fock space .",
    "one may also try to check directly the identity @xmath238 . in this type of approach",
    "one defines @xmath239 then , one shall prove that @xmath240 , _ i.e. _ @xmath241 for any mass - eigenstate state @xmath242 if @xmath236 is well defined .",
    "when multiplying @xmath243 and @xmath237 one typically get all coefficients vanished till the power of @xmath226 and then have a  tail  up to the @xmath244 coefficient .",
    "if @xmath236 is well defined , this tail is expected to vanish when @xmath226 is taken to infinity . however , this does not always happen in the perturbative expansion . to demonstrate this",
    "one may consider the last term of the `` tail '' given exactly by @xmath245 .",
    "recalling that @xmath246 generator contains @xmath247 combination , we can write the state @xmath248 as @xmath249 where @xmath250 denotes all states with less then @xmath251 number of particles and antiparticles .",
    "the norm of this state is then given by @xmath252 again when @xmath234 the above expression is not convergent and the @xmath253 expression is in fact not well defined in terms of mass - eigenstate fields .",
    "for small values of @xmath22 , however , the perturbative expansions are indeed convergent and the radius of convergence is related to the pole of @xmath69 on the complex plane of @xmath22 . here",
    ", the pole ( critical ) value is given by @xmath254 .",
    "we note that a straightforward use of the green function with the conventional definition @xmath255|0>$ ] encounters some difficulties in the mixing analysis due to the fact that the flavor vacuum state is not stationary in time ( @xmath256 ) .",
    "the conventional green function can not be adopted without specifying at which times the flavor vacua were taken in the inner product .",
    "in fact , the most obvious generalization of the green function as the overlap between the states created at times @xmath257 and @xmath258 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath259|0,x^0>$ ] ) breaks down due to the unitary inequivalence of the flavor fock spaces at different times . therefore , some sort of modification , like parallel translation of states to the same time , shall be needed to define the green function appropriate in the mixing analysis .",
    "the flavor mixing problem can then be treated using this modified propagation functions as discussed in the previous literature@xcite .    in the process of our calculations",
    "we also noticed that some entities indeed appeared as `` transition '' amplitudes from one state to another .",
    "for example , @xmath260 can be considered as superposition of `` vacuum rotation '' background contribution @xmath261 and contribution from @xmath154 transition with @xmath262 transition amplitude . in this manner",
    ", one can introduce the green function that only accounts for the transition amplitude without the vacuum contribution . in this way green function can be defined by : @xmath263 where the vacuum state is taken at any ( but certain ) fixed time , for example @xmath264 , and this coincides with the definition given in @xcite . for the propagator with a definite momentum @xmath51",
    ", we then obtain : @xmath265 eq.([commtime ] ) then allows to define the propagation functions for any kind of transition .",
    "we should note however that the treatment with such a modified green function does not cover all the variety of the effects in the mixing problem .",
    "in particular the condensate contribution @xmath261 , that can be related to the unitary inequivalence of the flavor fock spaces at different times , is lost so that this part of problem is missing when the above approach is taken .",
    "nevertheless , the green function method is useful in calculations of flavor - operator expectation values , scattering amplitudes and other quantities in which vacuum contribution @xmath266 cancels out .      in this sub - appendix , we remark on the arbitrary mass parametrization@xcite in the mixing problem .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite , one may treat the flavor fields that were initially written as @xmath267 equally well in an arbitrary mass basis,_i.e .",
    "_ @xmath268 where @xmath269 and @xmath270 are free - field amplitudes with some new arbitrary masses .",
    "since there is no physical reason to prefer one form over the other , ref.@xcite and then ref.@xcite claimed that no arbitrary mass parameters should appear in physically observable quantities,_i.e .",
    "_ they shall be invariant under specific bogoliubov transformation going from eq.([arb01 ] ) to eq.([arb02 ] ) @xcite @xmath271    it is true@xcite that the perturbative vacuum treatment @xcite yields the normalization of the flavor state not as unity but as some constant that depends on the arbitrary mass parameter . in particular , eq.([ladden ] ) can be viewed as an expansion of the flavor ladder operator in some basis constructed from the free - field ladder operators .",
    "then , the normalization of the one - particle state in perturbative vacuum treatment @xcite was given only by @xmath272 coefficient at the @xmath273 operator , that is obviously depending on the choice of basis , e.g. changes with rotation in \\{(@xmath274)&(@xmath275 ) } plane .",
    "such arbitrariness is completely avoided in the exact vacuum treatment because the normalization of the flavor state is given by unity no matter what mass - basis is used .",
    "however , the claim@xcite that the number expectation values are not physical because they do depend on the arbitrary mass parameters can not be correct . as a counter example to such claim",
    ", one can consider a very specific case of the mixing problem , namely when the mixing is absent ( @xmath276 ) . as we discuss below",
    ", applying such claim@xcite to this specific example leads to a conclusion that can not be correct . with no mixing ,",
    "we are dealing with nothing else but free - field problem where the particle number operator @xmath277 and the particle number expectation value @xmath278 ( for simplicity we consider fermion case ) must be well - defined physically observable quantities .",
    "however , when we apply the transformation given by eq.([arb03 ] ) and compare directly eq.([arb01 ] ) and eq.([arb02 ] ) , we observe that @xmath279 and @xmath280 where we follow the notations in refs.@xcite . in the case of free fields",
    "the number expectation value does depend on the arbitrary mass parameters and thus following the above claim one may conclude that @xmath281 is not a physically measurable quantity . however , this can not be correct because both the particle number operator and the number expectation value in the free - field problem are well - defined physical observables .",
    "we viewed the above inconsistency as follows . the transformation given by eq.([arb03 ] ) is in fact nothing else but redefinition of the particle states , so that the tilde quantities correspond to some new quasiparticle objects and the number operator now describes the number of different type of particles than before .",
    "therefore , the number operator average shall not be expected to be same in such transformations .",
    "indeed , it should change in some covariant and self - consistent manner instead of being invariant under such a redefinition .",
