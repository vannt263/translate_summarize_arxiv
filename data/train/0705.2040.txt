    "collimation is a generic feature of outflows in astrophysics .",
    "it appears in outflows from protostars , agns , microquasars and grbs . despite many efforts to identify the mechanisms responsible for the acceleration and collimation of jets ,",
    "there is as yet no universally accepted explanation for these processes .",
    "one possibility is that jets are collimated by magnetic hoop stress that arises when the field is wound up by rotation .",
    "this , however , requires ordered magnetic fields of sufficient strength to be present in the vicinity of the central engine .",
    "whether such fields can be generated is yet an open issue .",
    "recent 3d simulations of accretion disks demonstrate that , although near equipartition magnetic fields can be generated by the mri process , they are not expected to be ordered in general , except perhaps within a flux tube that is connected to the horizon of a rapidly rotating black hole ( mckinney & gammie 2004 ; mckinney , 2005 ; hawley & krolik 2006 ; see also krolik 2007 , and references therein ) . even if it can be produced , such a field configuration may be kink unstable ( lyubarsky 1992 ; eichler , 1993 ; begelman , 1998 ; but c.f . , mckinney , 2006 ) and only slowly collimated ( e.g. , begelman & li 1994 , lyutikov 2006 ; but c.f . ,",
    "beskin & nokhrina 2006 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the relativistic outflow is collimated by the pressure and inertia of a surrounding medium .",
    "a particular application of the latter mechanism is the prompt phase of grbs , during which a multicomponent outflow is likely to be expelled by the central source : the hyper - accretion rates anticipated following the collapse of a massive star or coalescence of compact objects render the disk surrounding the black hole extremely hot and dense . under such conditions",
    "the disk is optically thick to electromagnetic radiation and cools predominantly by emission of mev neutrinos ( popham et al .",
    "1999 ; pruet et al .",
    "the prodigious neutrino luminosity drives a powerful , baryon rich wind from the inner disk radii that expands at sub or mildly relativistic speed .",
    "the ultra - relativistic , baryon poor outflow is produced most likely in a polar region which is protected from baryon contamination by either magnetic field lines threading the horizon or by an angular momentum barrier .",
    "the energy that powers the inner , grb - producing jet may be deposited by neutrino annihilation above the horizon ( e.g. , levinson & eichler 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ; aloy et al .",
    "2000 ; rosswog & ramirez - ruiz 2003 ; aloy et al . 2005 ) .",
    "alternatively the energy may be extracted magnetically from the spin of the black hole ( levinson & eichler , 1993 ; meszaros & rees , 1997 ; van putten , 2001 ; mckinney , 2005 ) , or the inner disk regions ( e.g. , vlahakis & konigl , 2003 ; levinson , 2006a ) . in this case",
    "the outflow is expected to be magnetically dominated , however , the magnetic energy should eventually be converted somehow to matter and radiation .",
    "collimation of the inner outflow by the surrounding wind is expected if the streamlines of the latter diverge slower than the streamlines of the former .",
    "a related issue is the dissipation of the bulk energy of the fireball .",
    "the standard view ( see e.g. , piran 2005 , and references therein ) , at least until recently , was that the prompt grb emission is produced behind internal shocks that form in the coasting region of a baryon loaded fireball .",
    "this scenario was originally motivated by the detection , in many sources , of a power law component of the prompt emission spectrum extending up to energies well above the mev peak , in conflict with the thermal spectrum expected from an adiabatically expanding , baryon free fireball ( paczynski , 1986 ) .",
    "the post - swift discoveries of a shallow afterglow phase at early times , and fastly rising , large amplitude x - ray flares in the early afterglow phase ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) introduces new puzzles . according to some interpretations ( e.g. , fan and wei 2005 )",
    "these observations imply prolonged activity of the central engine .",
    "if true , then this may indicate that @xmath0-rays are emitted during the prompt phase with very high efficiency , in the sense that the remaining bulk energy is a small fraction of the total blast wave energy inferred from the afterglow emission .",
    "such episodes can be quite naturally explained as resulting from dissipation in an electron - positron dominated plasma .",
    "alternative explanations involve variations of the micro - physical parameters and do not require extremely high efficiency ( granot et al .",
    "2006 ) .    the difficulty with purely leptonic fireball models mentioned above may be alleviated if dissipation occurs during the outflow acceleration .",
    "the claim that internal shocks must form in the coasting region , since different shells can not catch up at radii where the fireball is accelerating , applies only to conical geometries . as is shown below , collisions of the accelerating fireball with the surrounding wind leads to formation of strong oblique shocks well below the coasting region .",
    "bulk comptonization may then give rise to a nonthermal extension of the spectrum well above the thermal peak .",
    "it is quite likely that these shocks pass through a photosphere in which case the nonthermal photons may escape the system before being thermalized .",
    "a preliminary analysis of hydrodynamic collimation of a baryon poor outflow by a wind expelled from a thin torus has been presented in levinson and eichler ( 2000 , hereafter le00 ) . for this particular wind geometry le00 have found that the opening angle equals the ratio of the power output of the inner fireball to that of the exterior baryonic wind , and suggested that the huge apparent isotropic luminosities implied for some grb s ( e.g. , grb 990123 ) can be understood in terms of collimation of the fireball by an outer baryonic wind with more modest energetics , roughly the geometric mean of the fireball energy and its isotropic equivalent .",
    "detailed numerical simulations of acceleration and confinement of baryon free fireballs produced by deposition of thermal energy above the poles of a non - rotating , stellar mass black hole that accretes matter from a thick torus have been performed later by aloy et al .",
    "however , the confining medium in those simulations was restricted to some specific configurations obtained in ns+ns and ns+bh merger simulations , which might be relevant for short grbs .",
    "jet breakout in collapsars have been studied using axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations ( aloy et al .",
    "magnetohydrodynamic simulations of outflow formation in collapsars have also been reported recently ( proga , et al .",
    "2003 ) .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the model outlined in le00 to incorporate additional important features that have been ignored there for the sake of simplicity .",
    "in particular , we relax the assumption that the baryon poor jet ( bpj ) is fully shocked and compute the structure of the shocked bpj layer , explore other geometries of the confining medium , and consider also cases where the outer shock has a finite compression ratio .",
    "our approach is to construct semi - analytic models for the interaction of a baryon poor outflow with a surrounding medium , assuming steady state and axial symmetry .",
    "we consider an accelerating , ultra - relativistic bpj confined by the pressure and inertia of a surrounding matter . in case of confinement by a supersonic wind",
    ", we envision that the surrounding wind is expelled ( e.g. , from an extended disk or torus ) over a range of scales larger than the characteristic size of the central engine ejecting the bpj , so that not too far out its streamlines may diverge more slowly than the bpj streamlines , thereby giving rise to a collision of the two outflows . in general",
    ", such a collision will lead to the formation of a contact discontinuity across which the total pressure is continuous , and two oblique shocks , one in each fluid , across which the streamlines of the colliding ( unshocked ) fluids are deflected , as shown schematically in fig 1 .",
    "the details of this structure will depend , quite generally , on the parameters of the two outflows and on the boundary conditions .",
    "since we are merely interested in the ejection phase following the outflow formation in the case of coalescence of a compact binary , or the breakout episode in the case of explosion inside a star , as in the collapsar model , it is reasonable to assume that the system under consideration is time independent and axially symmetric , which greatly simplifies the analysis .",
    "this of course excludes any temporal effects associated with kelvin - helmholtz instabilities , mixing of the two fluids , etc .",
    ", at the interface separating the two outflows which can only be studied using 3d numerical simulations . on the other hand , it provides a simple and convenient way to study the gross structure of such a system and to gain some insight into the physics involved .",
    "it may also provide a test case for more sophisticated simulations . to this end",
    ", we construct in what follows semi - analytic models of colliding outflows .",
    "we seek to determine the structure of the shocked layers assuming that the parameters of the unshocked fluids are given .",
    "the problem is then characterized by the following independent variables : the rest mass density @xmath1 , pressure @xmath2 , specific enthalpy @xmath3 , and 4-velocity @xmath4 of the shocked bpj fluid ; the rest mass density @xmath5 , pressure @xmath6 , specific enthalpy @xmath7 , and 4-velocity @xmath8 of the shocked wind fluid , and the cross - sectional radii of the inner shock surface @xmath9 , outer shock surface @xmath10 and the contact discontinuity surface @xmath11 .",

    ", we made some runs with different initial conditions .",
    "in most cases it has been found that the solution is highly insensitive to boundary conditions , and that after some initial phase the integration quickly converges to the same solution .",
    "we consider first the possibility that the bpj is collimated by the kinetic pressure of the surrounding medium .",
    "as mentioned above , this is naturally expected when the surrounding medium is static or highly subsonic , as in the case where the confining medium is the stellar envelope into which a fireball is ejected in the collapsar model for grbs .",

    "when @xmath73 the oblique shock that forms as a result of collision of the bpj with the confining walls should diverge slower than conical or even converge to the axis .",

    "an example is shown in fig 3 , where results of numerical integration are exhibited for @xmath82 and two different values of @xmath62 . in both cases",
    "shown the contact discontinuity surface has the same shape . the evolution of the inner shock surface , however , depends on @xmath62 , as can be seen .",
    "whether the shock front converges to the axis or diverges away from it depends on the value of the impact angle required to sustain momentum balance ( see also komissarov & falle , 1997 ) .",
    "we find that when the condition @xmath83 $ ] is satisfied , the shock front is inclined towards the axis and the bpj quickly becomes fully shocked .",
    "the reflection of the oblique shocks at the symmetry axis should lead to formation of internal shocks , which may affect somewhat the resultant structure ( e.g. , aloy et al .",
    "2000 ) . in particular it is expected to lead to inhomogeneities in the parameters of the shocked bpj .",
    "however , we believe that this should not affect the average structure dramatically .    in the region where the bpj can be considered fully shocked we have @xmath84 .",

    "evidently , collimation requires @xmath73 . as pointed out in le00 , in the case where the pressure is contributed by a transonic wind ,",
    "such collimation will occur naturally in the region located within the acceleration zone of the bpj and above the acceleration zone of the surrounding wind ( roughly above its critical point ) , even if the two outflows have the same equation of state .",
    "the reason is that in this region the density profile of the bpj declines with radius as @xmath90 ( for a conical geometry ) while that of the slow wind declines as @xmath91 , since the wind has reached its terminal velocity . adopting an equation of state of the form @xmath92 for the baryonic fluid yields @xmath93 for a conical ( or spherical ) wind , for which @xmath94 .",
    "convergence occurs for @xmath95 , which is the case for both relativistic gas ( @xmath96 ) and non - relativistic gas ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "the bpj breakout angle from a collapsar surface can be estimated from equation ( [ r_c - pressure ] ) to be , @xmath98 where @xmath99 if the coasting radius lies outside the stellar envelope and @xmath100 if it lies inside , @xmath101 cm is the location of the stellar envelope ( e.g macfadyen & woosley , 1999 ) .",
    "for example in the configuration shown in fig 3 we find that @xmath102 .",
    "it is worth noting that collimation shocks should continue to form near the interface separating the two outflows whenever deflection of streamlines occurs .",
    "such effects can not be accounted for by the 1d model presented here .",
    "we consider next the situation wherein the bpj collides with a supersonic wind .",
    "the analysis can be simplified by assuming that the exterior wind is deflected into a very thin shock compared with the cross - sectional radius of the contact discontinuity , and that on all scales the momentum transfer is dominated by the ram pressure of the wind . in this limit",
    "one can take @xmath70 in the above equations .",
    "this effectively assumes an infinite compression ratio for the outer shock and may be a reasonable approximation when the cooling time of the shocked fluid is much shorter than the expansion time .",
    "however , under conditions anticipated in grbs the optical depth of the shocked wind layer is expected to be very large on scales of interest and radiative cooling can be ignored . as is shown below , the resultant pressure of the shocked wind layer is larger in this case , owing to the larger inclination of the shock front , thereby giving rise to a better collimation .",
    "nonetheless , for illustrative purposes we analyze first the case where the deflected wind layer is negligibly thin . with @xmath103 equations ( [ state_eq_jet ] ) , ( [ mass_eq_j ] ) , ( [ energy_eq_j ] ) , and ( [ momz_eq_j ] ) , and the condition @xmath104 which follows from eqs . ( [ momn3_eq_j])-([p_eq_c ] ) , provide a complete description of the bpj structure .",
    "further simplification is possible when the inner shock angle is sufficiently small , viz . , @xmath105 , such that the energy and momentum fluxes incident through the inner shock can be neglected .",

    "the above trend have been confirmed by numerical integration of the full set of equations ( [ state_eq_jet ] ) , ( [ mass_eq_j ] ) , ( [ energy_eq_j ] ) , ( [ momz_eq_j ] ) , and ( [ jump - rad - c ] ) . an example is shown in fig 4 for the split monopole wind exhibited in fig 2 with @xmath125 .",

    "this stronger dependence is a consequence of the large impact angles @xmath30 that give rise to a much stronger compression near the injection point of the bpj .",
    "better collimation can be achieved when the streamlines of the exterior wind diverge slower than conical .",

    "integration of the full set ( [ state_eq_jet ] ) , ( [ mass_eq_j ] ) , ( [ energy_eq_j ] ) , ( [ momz_eq_j ] ) and ( [ jump - rad - c ] ) confirms again this behaviour . because of the larger flux of transverse momentum through the outer shock , convergence of the inner shock towards the axis occurs at much lower values of @xmath121 than in the split monopole case .",
    "we now consider the limit where energy losses by the deflected wind layer are negligible . in that case",
    "the deflected wind layer can not be considered thin and the constraint @xmath70 must be relaxed .",
    "we must then numerically integrate the full set of equations ( [ state_eq_jet])-([p_eq_c ] ) . as explained above , eqs .",
    "( [ state_eq_jet])-([p_eq_c ] ) have been derived using the small angle approximation . however , for the cases examined below we find that the angle of the outer shock surface , @xmath148 , is typically not small .",
    "this leads to an overestimate of the ratio of energy and momentum fluxes incident through the shock front , and tends to produce some artificial dissipation inside the shocked wind layer . to correct for this effect , we computed the energy and momentum fluxes that pass through the shock locally by solving the jump conditions of an infinite planar oblique shock .",
    "results of such calculations , using for a comparison a split monopole wind with the same parameters used in fig 4 , are exhibited in fig 6 .",
    "comparison of figs 4 and 6 reveals that better collimation is achieved in the absence of energy losses behind the shock .",
    "the bpj in this case does not become conical asymptotically , as in the thin shock case exhibited in fig 6 , but rather the profile of the contact discontinuity surface approaches @xmath149 roughly .",
    "the reason for this behaviour is that the smaller compression ratio of the shock gives rise to a larger inclination of the shock front and , hence , a larger impact angle @xmath30 , as seen in fig 6 .",
    "this in turn leads to a larger pressure behind the shock , as implied by eq .",
    "( [ momn3t_eq_w ] )",
    ".    our analysis does not take into account effects associated with the formation of a rarefaction wave near the interface separating the shocked bpj and wind fluids in the region where the deflected wind layer is highly supersonic .",
    "this should give rise to a somewhat steeper decline of the pressure supporting the bpj , and the consequent alteration of the resultant structure in this region .",
    "under certain conditions the fluid that resides between the contact discontinuity and the rarefaction wave can quickly accelerate to high lorentz factors ( rezzolla et al .",
    "2003 ; aloy & rezzolla 2006 ) .",
    "we find that the contact discontinuity surface becomes causally disconnected from the outer shock front ( that is , the shocked wind layer expands sideways at a speed that exceeds the local sound speed ) at @xmath150 a few . at this height",
    "the bpj has already been substantially collimated . for @xmath151 and @xmath152",
    "we find @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively at the decoupling point .",
    "the main limitation of our model is that it can not account for any temporal effects , particularly those associated with kelvin - helmholtz instabilities at the interface separating the two outflows .",
    "linear analysis by hardee & hughes ( 2003 ) for a cylindrical , non accelerating flow embedded in an external medium indicates that non - axisymmetric modes , particularly low order helical and elliptical modes , are likely do grow on time scales of the order of the jet crossing time .",
    "the presence of a viscous boundary layer ( that they modeled as a wind ) leads to suppression of the non - axisymmetric modes and an increase of the growth rate of the zeroth order axisymmetric pinch mode .",
    "if the instability grows to a nonlinear state over the expansion time then pinching of the fast jet and mixing of wind material with the light jet fluid near the interface is anticipated .",
    "this can modify the transverse structure of the jet , and produce internal shocks that can lead to further dissipation of the bulk energy of the jet ( see next section for further discussion ) .",
    "numerical simulations exhibit some evidence for such instabilities ( e.g. , aloy , 2005 ; hardee & hughes 2003 ) , although the details may depend on the configuration of the confining medium , and on the structure of the viscous boundary layer .",
    "in particular , we are not aware of any simulations of jet confinement by an external , supersonic wind .",
    "we naively expect suppression of the instability in cases where the external wind is mildly relativistic , owing to the small velocity shear .",
    "we have constructed a class of semi - analytic models for the collimation and confinement of an accelerating , ultra - relativistic outflow by the pressure and inertia of a surrounding medium , under conditions anticipated near the central engines of grbs .",
    "we considered two different scenarios : in the first one the inner flow is assumed to be confined by the kinetic pressure of a subsonic ( or static ) corona that extends vertically over several characteristic scales . in the second one",
    "it is envisaged that the inner outflow collides with a supersonic , baryon rich wind emanating from a disk or a torus surrounding the inner source .",
    "confinement in this case is accomplished by the ram pressure of the exterior wind . in general",
    ", the collision of the inner jet with the external medium creates a strong oblique shock across which the streamlines of the jet are deflected . in the case where the inner jet is confined by the ram pressure of a supersonic wind a second shock forms across which the exterior wind gets deflected .",
    "the shocked jet and wind layers are separated by a contact discontinuity surface across which the pressure is continuous .",
    "the gross features described above are observed in numerical simulations ( alloy et al .",
    "2000 , 2005 ) , although temporal effects complicate the structure .",
    "the evolution of the shocked jet layer depends , quite generally , on the configuration of the confining medium ( the pressure profile in the case of a static corona or the wind geometry in the case of confinement by a supersonic wind ) , and the opening angle of the injection cone of the inner outflow .",
    "we identified cases where the inner shock converges towards the axis , and cases where it diverges away from the axis ( depending on the opening angle of the inner flow ) . in the former case",
    "the inner flow quickly becomes fully shocked , whereas in the latter case the structure of the polar outflow consists of a core containing the unshocked ultrarelativistic jet enveloped by the shocked jet layer that expands relativistically , but with a lorentz factor considerably smaller than that of the unshocked jet .",
    "the observational consequences of such a structure have been discussed elsewhere ( eichler and levinson 2003 , 2004 ; levinson and eichler 2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "the structure of the inner jet , when confined by the ram pressure of a supersonic wind , depends on the geometry of the wind and the conditions inside the shocked wind layer . for wind geometries with radially diverging streamlines ( e.g. , split monopole )",
    "we find that if the shocked wind layer can be considered negligibly thin ( e.g. , due to rapid cooling ) , then after an initial collimation phase the inner jet becomes conical with an opening angle that scales roughly as @xmath155 above the geometrical limit , where @xmath79 and @xmath64 are the total power of the unshocked jet and wind , respectively",
    ". a stronger dependence of the opening angle on the power output ratio has been found for exterior wind configurations in which some streamlines are inclined towards the axis , as in the case of a wind from a thin torus invoked in le00 . in the absence of energy losses from the shocked wind layer the streamlines of the shocked baryon poor flow diverge slower than conical , owing to the larger pressure of the shocked wind . for the cases examined above we find that the cross sectional radius of the contact discontinuity scales roughly as @xmath149 .",
    "however , at some radius the outer shock and the contact discontinuity become causally disconnected , at which point collimation should be less effective .",
    "the opening angle of the inner jet at the decoupling point is typically smaller than that found in the case of an infinite compression ratio shock .",
    "the formation of a rarefaction wave may act as a booster on the bpj fluid contained between the contact discontinuity and the rarefaction wave , as demonstrated by aloy & rezzolla 2006 , although this effect should be explored further for the situation considered here .",
    "free neutrons leaking across the interface separating the baryonic wind and the shocked bpj layer will be picked up by the bpj , leading to baryon loading of the inner flow and the consequent emission of high - energy neutrinos and @xmath0-rays , as discussed in levinson & eichler ( 2003 ) .",
    "however , kelvin - helmholtz instabilities at the interface may alter this picture in ways that need to be explored .    in situations in which the inner jet is confined by the kinetic pressure of a medium having a pressure profile of the form @xmath156 , the cross - sectional radius of the shocked baryon poor jet scales as @xmath157 .",
    "if the pressure is contributed by a coasting wind , then collimation ( @xmath73 ) is expected to occur naturally in the acceleration zone of the inner , baryon poor flow .",
    "it has been argued that internal shocks can not form in the acceleration zone of a fireball since different fluid shells can not catch up there . as demonstrated above , collisions of the accelerating baryon poor outflow with exterior medium can lead to dissipation of a considerable fraction of its bulk energy below the coasting region through formation of strong oblique shocks .",
    "moreover , reflection of those shocks at the symmetry axis , which may occur under certain conditions , and/or intermittent ejection of the inner outflow and/or the confining wind should lead to large temporal variations of the lorentz factor of the deflected flow at a given position , and the consequent collisions of different blobs of baryon poor fluid that have been deflected by the confining medium ( see also eichler 1994 ; aloy et al .",
    "the internal shocks thereby created would give rise to additional dissipation over a large range of radii .",
    "those shocks are expected to be radiation mediated .",
    "the radiative efficiency is expected to be very high if the photosphere is located below the coasting region .",
    "the photon distribution produced inside those shocks is likely to have a nonthermal extension at high energies owing to multiple compton scattering on the converging flow ( a relativistic version of the blandford pyne process ) .",
    "if the shocks are produced at a modest optical depth then the nonthermal photons may escape before being thermalized , giving rise to a nonthermal spectral component of the prompt grb emission , as proposed earlier ( e.g. , eichler 1994 ; levinson 2006b , and references therein ) .",
    "detailed calculations are required to assess whether this process can indeed explain the observed spectra .    finally , we comment on the applicability of this model to other systems .",
    "opacity arguments suggest that the rapid variability of the tev emission observed in the tev blazars implies high doppler factors of the emitting plasma in the @xmath0-ray emission zone ( e.g. , levinson 2006b ) .",
    "such high values of the doppler factor are in clear disagreement with the much lower values inferred from radio observations ( e.g. , urry & padovani 1991 ; marscher 1999 ; jorstad et al .",
    "various explanations , including jet deceleration ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003 ) , a structure consisting of interacting spine and sheath ( ghisellini et al . 2005 ) , and opening angle effects ( gopal - krishna et al .",
    "2004 ) have been proposed in order to resolve this discrepancy .",
    "stationary radio features have been observed also in other systems , and on various scales , where relativistic expansion is inferred or expected ( e.g. , hst1 knot in m87 ) .",
    "we emphasize that , while the lorentz factors inferred from radio observations reflect the speed of the emission pattern , the rapid variability of the very high energy @xmath0-ray emission constrains the lorentz factor of the fluid elements emitting the @xmath0 rays .",
    "dissipation behind recollimation shocks can naturally account for large differences between the speeds of the dissipation pattern and the outflowing matter .",
    "in particular , stationary features in a relativistic outflow can be easily produced , as demonstrated by komissarov & falle ( 1997 ) . while it is quite likely that the tev flares in the bl lac objects",
    "are produced by decelerating fronts , recollimation on small scales , particularly in the case of efficient radiative cooling , can alleviate the requirements on the lorentz factors ( levinson 2007 , in preparation ) .",
    "it has been proposed recently ( stawarz et al . 2007 ) that the hst1 knot in the m87 jet may be associated with a converging shock in a reconfinement nozzle .",
