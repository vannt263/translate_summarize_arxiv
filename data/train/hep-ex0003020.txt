    "a large contribution to the photoproduction of @xmath0  mesons is the _ elastic _ process , @xmath124 , which has been studied previously over a wide range , from threshold up to a photon - proton centre - of - mass  energy , @xmath2 , of approximately @xmath125 in @xmath126 collisions at hera .",
    "the cross section for elastic @xmath0  photoproduction was observed to rise much more steeply with @xmath2  @xcite than that for the light vector mesons  @xcite . in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) ,",
    "the process is viewed as an almost real photon from the lepton coupling to a pair of @xmath127  quarks which interact with the proton via exchange of two ( or more ) gluons and evolve into a @xmath0meson .",
    "the cross section is then proportional to the square of the gluon density of the proton .",
    "the rapid rise of the gluon density at low fractional gluon momenta leads to the observed rise of the cross section  with @xmath2  @xcite . in such calculations ,",
    "the heavy quark mass serves as the qcd scale .",
    "therefore , it is of interest to measure the cross section  of the @xmath1 meson , for which perturbation theory might be more reliable . in non - perturbative models , @xmath0 production has been described in terms of pomeron exchange  @xcite .",
    "since the standard soft pomeron fails to describe inclusive electroproduction and the observed @xmath2  dependence of the @xmath0   cross section , extensions of such models have been proposed  @xcite .",
    "in one such extension  @xcite , which is compared to the data of this paper , an extra `` hard '' pomeron is introduced .    here , we present new data obtained by the h1 experiment which may lead to a better understanding of the elastic production process .",
    "the @xmath2  dependence of the cross section  for elastic @xmath0  photoproduction is measured , with increased statistics in an enlarged range of @xmath128 , and compared to qcd and pomeron models .",
    "furthermore , the differential cross section @xmath7 , where @xmath129 is the squared four - momentum transfer to the proton , is measured as a function of @xmath8 and of @xmath2 . from its @xmath2  dependence ,",
    "an effective regge trajectory is determined using data from this experiment alone , thus avoiding relative normalization problems when comparing data from different experiments .",
    "the results are compared to the predictions of the two - pomeron model  @xcite and also to a recent calculation in next - to - leading order ( nlo ) using the bfkl equation  @xcite .",
    "finally , we present a measurement of elastic photoproduction of @xmath1  mesons which allows a test of the predictions of pqcd at a higher mass scale  @xcite .",
    "we report , here , an analysis of the process @xmath130 , ( @xmath131 ) , where @xmath0  mesons decaying to @xmath132 and @xmath133 and @xmath1@xmath134 are observed .",
