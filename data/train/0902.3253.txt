    "a new opportunity to study stellar processes near massive black holes ( mbhs ) arises with the anticipated detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) by the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) .",
    "lisa will be a space - based detector in orbit around the sun , consisting of three satellites five million kilometres apart",
    ". it will be sensitive to gws in a frequency range @xmath2 hz .",
    "an important source of gws for lisa is the inspiral of compact objects onto mbhs in galactic nuclei ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; see @xcite @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these are sources on highly eccentric orbits with periapses slightly larger than the schwarzschild radius @xmath3 of the mbh , where @xmath4 is the mass of the mbh .",
    "the star dissipates energy due to gw emission , and as a result spirals in .",
    "such extreme mass ratio inspirals ( emris ) can be observed by lisa to cosmological distances if the orbital period of the star is shorter than @xmath5 sec ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "lisa will detect hundreds to thousands of such captures over its projected 3 - 5 yr mission life time @xcite .    for most of the inspiral",
    "the emitted gws are not observable by lisa .",
    "these gws give rise to a source of confusion noise , possibly obscuring other types of gw sources .",
    "the shape and overall magnitude of this emri background has been studied by @xcite .",
    "they do not study the dynamical requirements of inspiral , but scale their result with possible emri rates of @xcite .",
    "therefore noise of stars that do not eventually spiral in is not included .",
    "@xcite show that stars on long periods of a few years and nearly radial orbits that carry them near the schwarzschild radius of the mbh , emit bursts of gws that for the galactic centre will give a signal to noise ratio larger than 5 . taking into account processes determining the inner radius of the density profile as well as mass segregation effects",
    ", @xcite find that stellar mass black holes ( bhs ) have a burst rate of order @xmath6 yr@xmath7 , while the rate is @xmath8 yr@xmath7 for main sequence stars ( mss ) and white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "individual bursts from star - mbh fly - bys may be detected from our own galactic centre , but it is unlikely they will be observed from other galactic nuclei .",
    "however , the accumulation of all bursts of all galaxies in the universe gives rise to an extreme mass ratio burst background ( embb ) .",
    "since the energy emitted per event is much higher for inspirals compared to fly - bys , but the event rate is much lower @xcite , it is not a priori clear which of these dominates the confuse background . in this paper",
    "we study the contribution of these fly - bys to the gw background . in  [ s : single ] we derive an analytical expression for the event rate of gw bursts in a galactic nucleus .",
    "this model diverges at several boundaries , and we consider in  [ sec : processes ] what the physical processes are that determine the range within which our model is valid .",
    "our formalism is similar to that of the galactic burst rate of @xcite .",
    "we derive an expression for the emitted energy spectrum of gw bursts in a single galactic nucleus in ",
    "[ s : em ] . a relation for the embb from the accumulation of gw bursts from all redshifts observed by lisa",
    "is derived in  [ s : stoch ] . in  [ s : results ] we compare the resulting embb to the instrumental noise of lisa @xcite , and to other astrophysical backgrounds .",
    "we conclude in  [ s : disc ] and discuss what our model implies for the possibility of directly detecting relativistic bursts of gws from our galactic centre .",
    "in this section , we present a simple model for a galactic nucleus and derive the burst rate for that model .",
    "we discard parts of phase - space in our model where stars are unlikely to exist due to various processes .",
    "a mbh dominates the potential inside the radius of influence @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the stellar velocity dispersion far away from the mbh .",
    "the mbh mass is empirically related to the velocity dispersion of the bulge by @xmath11 ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . inside the radius of influence",
    ", stellar orbits are assumed to be keplerian .",
    "galactic nuclei with @xmath12 have relaxation times less than a hubble time and are dynamically relaxed , while for very massive mbhs , the distribution will depend on the initial conditions .",
    "however even in this case the inner region of the cusp may be of power - law form due to the effect caused by a slow growth of a black hole inside a stellar system ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we will for simplicity assume that our models also apply for @xmath13 .",
    "the contribution of such mbhs is only marginal for the embb , and this assumption does not affect our result .",
    "we assume the distribution within @xmath14 to be spherically symmetric in space and approximately isotropic in velocity space .",
    "the radial density profile is approximated by a power law , @xmath15 ( e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) , where the slope @xmath16 depends on the stellar mass @xmath17 ; due to mass segregation @xcite , larger masses have larger @xmath18 . the number of stars @xmath19 of type @xmath20 in an element @xmath21 is then given by    @xmath22    where we assume @xmath23 .",
    "the total number of stars of type @xmath20 within @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 .",
    "we calibrate the parameters @xmath26 using solutions to fokker - planck equations applied to the galactic centre @xcite , such that the number of stars within @xmath27 agrees with those simulations .",
    "since the density distribution of a species @xmath20 is not a strict power law in the fokker - planck models , this implies that our density profile is a good approximation only at small radii . since the burst rate is dominated at those small radii ( see equation [ [ eq : gamma ] ] ) , the small mismatch at larger radii will not strongly affect our conclusions .",
    "a useful parametrisation of an orbit is the frequency a star would have on a circular orbit with radius of its periapse @xmath28 , @xmath29 note that for eccentric orbits @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the orbital period .",
    "the number of stars @xmath32 in an element @xmath33 is then    @xmath34    where it was assumed that @xmath35 .",
    "a star on a highly eccentric orbit emits almost all of its gw energy at periapse in a single gw burst . the burst rate per logarithmic unit of the semi - major axis and frequency at which stars of species @xmath20 have a bursting interaction with the mbh is given by    @xmath36    where we convert to dimensionless units defined as @xmath37 ; @xmath38 ; @xmath39 , and @xmath40 ; @xmath41 ; @xmath42 .",
    "since we describe the profile of the galactic nucleus by power laws , integration over orbital space leads to formal divergences , and it is therefore important to determine the boundaries of validity of our model . in the next section we consider a number of processes that can determine the inner edge of the stellar cusp .",
    "the burst rate is approximately proportional to @xmath43 ( see equation [ [ eq : gamma ] ] ) . as typical values for @xmath44",
    "are in the range @xmath45 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the gw energy spectrum is dominated by gw bursts from stellar orbits at small radii and therefore we focus on the stellar dynamics in the vicinity of a mbh .",
    "as a star loses energy repeatedly with every periapse passage due to gw emission , it spirals in .",
    "unresolvable emris constitute a background noise for lisa studied by @xcite .",
    "our study instead focuses on the subset of extreme mass ratio events that do _ not _ spiral in , and gw emission from emris must be excluded .",
    "we note that the dynamics of the progenitors of emri noise and burst noise is very different .",
    "the part of phase space where stars spiral in is at any particular time typically not populated , so that , e.g. , equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) does not apply .",
    "the amount of energy @xmath46 that is lost in one period is given by @xcite as    @xmath47    where for highly eccentric orbits @xmath48 .",
    "we define the characteristic time for inspiral @xmath49 as the time it takes the initial orbital energy @xmath50 to grow formally to infinity , @xmath51    while the orbit decays , two body scattering by other stars perturbs it , changing the orbital angular momentum by order of itself in a timescale @xmath52 .",
    "the magnitude and direction of the step in angular momentum is a random walk process , and typically in a relaxation time the step is of the size of the circular angular momentum @xmath53 , and hence @xmath54 in this expression @xmath55 is the relaxation time ,    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is a numerical constant that also absorbs the coulomb logarithm , @xmath10 is the velocity dispersion far away from the mbh , and @xmath58 is the density of stars at the radius of influence .    due to strong mass - segregation @xcite , at small radii the relaxation time is dominated by bh interactions , while at large distances the mss dominate the relaxation rate .",
    "the true relaxation time is a combination of the bh and ms relaxation time , and in order to keep the calculation more tractable , we approximate it by a power law . as the burst rate is critically sensitive to the inner cut - off of the density profile , we chose the constant @xmath57 to calibrate the relaxation time at a small radius of @xmath59 for the model in @xcite .",
    "for those values , we find @xmath60 .    with this scaling the relaxation time and scatter time",
    "become    @xmath61    if @xmath62 , stars spiral in faster than they are replenished by other stars . in the corresponding region of orbit space , any bursting star is quickly accreted , so this region is typically empty ( see the appendix for further details ) . the fact that this part of phase - space is not populated has also consequences for the possibility of detecting relativistic bursts in the galactic centre",
    "; see  [ s : disc ] for further details .",
    "solving @xmath63 for @xmath64 gives an inner cut - off of    @xmath65    we assume that stars with @xmath66 always spiral in and we neglect these stars ( noise for these stars was accounted for by @xcite @xcite ) , while stars with @xmath67 never spiral in , and we take these stars into account as bursting sources .",
    "all stars with an angular momentum less than the last stable orbit @xmath68 ( the `` loss - cone '' ) are pulled into the mbh . since a star in this region of orbit space",
    "is removed in a dynamical time , we do not consider stars in this region . therefore stars only contribute gws to the embb",
    "if    @xmath69    in reality the empty region inside the loss - cone will also affect the regions nearby in angular momentum space @xcite , although this is partially erased by resonant relaxation ( @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) . here",
    "we assume that orbits outside the loss - cone are fully populated .",
    "tidal effects can play a role when the star is not compact .",
    "the tidal forces from the mbh on the ms disrupt those mss whose orbits carry them within the tidal radius @xmath70 of the mbh , where @xmath71 denotes the radius of the ms .",
    "this effect leads to a depletion of mss when @xmath72 , called the loss - cone for tidal disruptions .",
    "we only consider mss if    @xmath73    note that the break up frequency @xmath74 depends solely on the characteristics of the ms .",
    "close to a mbh , mss are likely to undergo multiple collisions in their lifetime ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the rate @xmath75 at which a ms with radius @xmath71 has grazing collisions can be estimated by @xmath76    multiple collisions can lead to the disruption of the ms .",
    "@xcite showed that on average a ms is disrupted after @xmath77 collisions .",
    "this implies that mss are saved from disruption by collisions within a hubble time , if their distance to the mbh is larger than @xmath78 where it was assumed that @xmath79 as in our main model .",
    "mss are contributing gws to the embb if their orbits obey @xmath80 .",
    "to summarise , the method to compute the gw burst rate of a single galactic nucleus is as follows .",
    "we consider four distinct species of stars , that is @xmath81 bhs , @xmath82 wds , @xmath83 neutron stars ( nss ) , and @xmath84 mss .",
    "their density profile is given by a slope of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "we assume that the enclosed number of ms stars within @xmath14 is @xmath89 .",
    "we calibrate our model such that for the galactic centre , the number of stars within @xmath27 is equal to that found in @xcite , to find @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 . from their models , we find that the relaxation time at @xmath59 in the galactic centre is @xmath94 , leading to a calibration factor of @xmath95 .",
    "we also consider a model suggested by @xcite . in this model , the density of the bhs at the radius of influence is higher by a factor 10 at @xmath14 compared to the main model , and the masses of the bhs are higher .",
    "such models may be relevant for galactic nuclei because of empirical hints that the initial mass function is much flatter than usual the galactic centre ( see e.g. @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we note that there are no dynamical constraints on the amount or mass of bhs in the galactic centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since in systems with many , more massive bhs mass segregation is less pronounced , the scaling for the density profile is not straightforward ; for example , the number of bhs enclosed within @xmath59 is only a factor @xmath96 higher than in our main model . using the relaxation times given in @xcite",
    ", we find that for this model @xmath97 ; @xmath98 ; @xmath99 ; and @xmath100 .",
    "when using these models , we exclude certain orbits due to the four processes described in the previous section .",
    "stars are only contributing gws if the inequalities ( [ eq : critinsp ] ) , ( [ eq : flso ] ) , ( [ eq : ftidal ] ) and ( [ eq : acoll ] ) are satisfied . as an illustration",
    "we show the orbit space around a mbh of @xmath101 for a bh of @xmath102 in figure ( [ fig : plotcut]a ) and for a ms of @xmath103 in figure ( [ fig : plotcut]b ) .",
    "the boundaries of the populated parts of the orbit space of compact objects are caused by two processes ; the inspiral process and the loss - cone .",
    "the cut - offs through the orbit space of mss are caused by all four processes of  [ sec : processes ] .",
    "we note that the processes that limit the gw burst rate depend on the mbh mass .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]",
    "for an eccentric newtonian orbit , the amount of energy emitted in gws in one period @xmath46 [ see eq .",

    "we assume that all energy @xmath46 is emitted at @xmath106 , therefore @xmath107 in reality , the spectrum is quite broad , but the exact shape of the spectrum is not important , since we sum over a very large number of bursts .",
    "we next integrate this spectrum over @xmath4 with the space number density of mbhs of @xcite , which we assume to be constant throughout the history of the universe , @xmath108 the upper boundary comes from a sharp drop in the observed mbh number density around @xmath109 .",
    "due to a lack of information on mbhs of @xmath110 , the lower boundary is arbitrarily chosen to be @xmath111 . although at frequencies between @xmath112 and @xmath113 hz , mbhs of the lowest masses contribute most to the embb , decreasing the lower bound only mildly affects the embb .",
    "the energy density of gw bursts emitted by stars of species @xmath20 is @xmath114      the gw spectrum observed by lisa is the accumulation of the gw radiation of all galaxies in the universe .",

    "@xmath121 , this is accurate to within @xmath1263 per cent .",
    "the approximation is justified since the embb is dominated by the nearby universe and contributions from @xmath127 accounts for just 5 - 8 per cent of that of @xmath121 .",

    "the embb is dominated by contributions from bhs .",
    "this is mainly due to two reasons .",
    "first , a single burst emitted by a bh is more energetic than a burst emitted by the other species of stars in a similar orbit .",
    "second , the bh distribution is steeper due to mass - segregation which leads to a higher burst rate , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma ] ) .",
    "note that the embb due to mss is cut off at @xmath132 hz , because tidal effects prohibit the existence of non - compact objects at small distances from the mbh .",
    "the emri background is caused by bhs that spiral in to the mbh .",
    "these sources are excluded in our calculations by eliminating inspiral orbits , see  [ sec : insp ] .",
    "the expression for the emri background was taken from @xcite and scales with the inspiral rate .",
    "from @xcite we take an inspiral rate of @xmath133 yr@xmath7 leading to a emri background at a level comparable to the instrumental noise of lisa .    in our favoured model",
    "the embb is well below the instrumental noise of lisa . at closest approach",
    "the embb @xmath131 is a factor @xmath126 10 below the instrumental noise of lisa , and a factor @xmath126 19 lower than the confusion noise of galactic wd binaries .",
    "the embb is also lower than the emri background in the interesting frequency range where the noise from emris is stronger than that of the instrument itself .    the @xcite model is also displayed in figure ( [ fig : zplota ] ) .",
    "in this model there are more , and more massive bhs , which raises the embb due to an increase in the number of bh bursts and an increase in the relaxation rate protecting stars from inspiral .",
    "figure ( [ fig : zplota ] ) shows the embb is raised by a factor @xmath134 on average with respect to our main model .",
    "however , even with this stellar distribution the embb is smaller than the instrumental noise of lisa by a factor @xmath135 , and a factor @xmath136 including the noise of galactic wd binaries .",
    "overall the sensitivity of the embb on the individual model parameters is not strong enough to raise the embb above the instrumental noise of lisa , without increasing @xmath137 by a factor 10 and other parameters by even more .",
    "stars whose orbits carry them near the schwarzschild radius of a mbh emit gravitational waves in the lisa frequency band . if the orbit of the star is very eccentric , the star emits bursts of gws each peri - centre passage without necessarily spiraling in .",
    "most extra - galactic bursts are not individually resolvable and hence will constitute a gravitational wave background .    for our favoured model the embb is dominated by gw bursts from bhs , and is a factor @xmath138 lower than the instrumental noise of lisa . including the wd galactic background increases the insignificance of the embb to a factor @xmath139 . even for the @xcite model , which has a much flatter mass function ,",
    "the embb is smaller than the instrumental noise of lisa by a factor @xmath140 ( or a factor @xmath141 including the wd galactic background ) .",
    "the embb is also well below the emri background ( @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "we conclude that the detection of gws by lisa will not be hindered by a background of bursting sources .    as an additional application of our model",
    ", we revisit the possibility of direct detection of gw bursts in the galactic centre , due to stars on relativistic orbits .",
    "@xcite have investigated the impact of including relativistic corrections to the description of the star s trajectory . the degree to which the relativistic corrections are important depends on the star s orbit and is largest for small peri - centre distances .",
    "@xcite find that orbits with peri - centre velocities @xmath142 account for approximately half of the events within the orbit space considered by @xcite around a mbh of @xmath143 .",
    "however , @xcite incorporate tight , possibly relativistic orbits that are unpopulated according to our assumptions of the boundaries in orbitspace of  [ sec : processes ] ( see also the appendix ) .",
