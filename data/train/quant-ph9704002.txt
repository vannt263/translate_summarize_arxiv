    "quantum error correction is the reversal of part of the adverse changes due to an undesired and unavoidable quantum process .",
    "code criteria for perfect error correction have been developed@xcite , and all presently known codes satisfy these criteria exactly . furthermore , most of these codes belong to a general gf(4 ) classification@xcite . in these schemes ,",
    "quantum bit ( qubit ) errors are described using a pauli ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) error basis , and coding is performed to allow correction of arbitrary unknown errors .",
    "however , in the usual case in the laboratory , one works with a specific apparatus with a particular dominant quantum noise process .",
    "the gf(4 ) codes do not take advantage of this specific knowledge , and may thus be sub - optimal , in terms of transmission rate and code complexity .",
    "unfortunately , there is no general method to construct quantum codes in a non - pauli basis , and few such codes are known@xcite .",
    "the code criteria are generally very difficult to satisfy , and without the pauli basis , no way is known to apply classical coding techniques for quantum error correction .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a novel approach to quantum error correction based on approximate satisfaction of the existing quantum error correction criteria .",
    "these approximate criteria are simpler and less restrictive , and in certain cases , such as for amplitude damping , codes can be found relatively more easily .",
    "the approximate criteria also admit more codes , therefore , codes requiring shorter block lengths may also be possible .",
    "for example , using this approach we have discovered a four bit code which corrects for single qubit _",
    "amplitude damping_@xcite errors .",
    "such a short _ non - degenerate _",
    "code is impossible using the pauli basis .",
    "the reason is that the effects @xcite to be corrected in a non - degenerate code have to map the codeword space to orthogonal spaces if the syndrome is to be detected unambiguously .",
    "hence , the minimum allowable size for the encoding space is the product of the dimension of the codeword space and the number of effects to be corrected .",
    "the single qubit amplitude damping effect operators expressed in the pauli basis are : @xmath4 \\label{eq : adzero } \\\\",

    "in contrast , in the pauli basis , any @xmath11 or @xmath12 error must be corrected by the code , so that @xmath13 possible effects must be dealt with .",
    "it follows that at least @xmath14 is required for a non - degenerate pauli basis code , in contrast to the four bit code which we demonstrate in this paper .",
    "the lessons are that ( 1 ) better codes may be found for specific error processes , and ( 2 ) approximate error correction simplifies code construction and admits more codes .",
    "approximate error correction is a property with no classical analogue , because it makes use of slight non - orthogonalities possible only between quantum states .",
    "we describe our approach to this problem by first exhibiting our four - bit example code in detail .",

    "thus , @xmath68 is also a high probability subset .",
    "now we generalize eq.([eq : pccond])-([eq : polardecom ] ) based on the following assumption : the error is parameterized by a certain number of small quantities with physical origins such as the strength and duration of the coupling between the system and the environment . for simplicity",
    ", we consider only one - parameter processes , and let @xmath97 be the small parameter .",
    "for example , @xmath97 can be the single qubit error probability .",
