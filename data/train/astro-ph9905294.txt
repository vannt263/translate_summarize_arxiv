    "light scattering induces polarization , and the intensity and polarization of the scattered light tells us the properties of the scattering medium .",
    "continuum radiation can be scattered over large volumes of space either by free electrons , or by dust grains in either diffuse or compact clouds .",
    "electron scattering is wavelength independent ( below x - ray energies ) and follows a simple scattering phase function ( @xmath1 ) , but dust scattering is much more complicated since the scattering efficiency and the phase function can be strongly dependent on wavelength , grain size , and grain composition .",
    "thus , light scattered by dust carries valuable information on the dust properties , and the purpose of this paper is to facilitate the extraction of this information .",
    "dust reflected light is observed in various galactic objects , either from large and diffuse reflection nebulae ( e.g. witt et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ; gordon et al .",
    "@xcite ; calzetti et al .",
    "@xcite ) , or from more compact , but still spatially resolved objects , such as dense molecular clumps ( e.g. the eagle nebula , hester et al .",

    "dust reflection is also inferred in some compact unresolved objects ( e.g. schulte - ladbeck et al .",
    "1992 ; rees & sitko 1996 ) , and is also likely to be present in young stellar objects with circumstellar disks ( e.g. chiang & goldreich 1997 ) .",
    "dust reflected light is also observed in various extragalactic objects . in particular in active galaxies , where dust obscuration plays a key role in unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 ; urry & padovani 1995 ) .",

    "the polarization rises towards shorter wavelengths , strongly suggesting optically thin dust scattering .    despite its potential usefulness ,",
    "almost no data currently exists on spectropolarimetry of spatially resolved scattered light in galactic objects ( see a rare exception in code et al .",
    "1996 ) . fortunately , significant amounts of spectropolarimetry , though mostly spatially unresolved , are available for extragalactic objects , in particular at the rest frame uv ( for high @xmath2 objects ) , where most of the spectral polarization features are predicted , and which therefore provides the strongest diagnostic power .    in this paper",
    "we provide a detailed set of predictions for the wavelength dependence of the intensity , percent polarization , polarization plane , and circular polarization , of light scattered by dust in the near ir to the far uv .",
    "these properties are explored here for a given dust model over a range of scattering geometries for either optically thin or optically thick dust . in a following paper",
    "we explore these properties for various dust models , as characterized by the grain size distribution and grain composition .",
    "these predictions , together with new high quality spectropolarimetry in the near ir to the far uv of reflection dominated objects , should allow significant constraints on the properties of dust in various galactic and extragalactic environments .",
    "earlier calculations of polarized radiative transfer in a dusty optically thick medium were made by white ( 1979a , b ) , kartje ( @xcite ) , code & whitney ( @xcite ) , and wolf & henning ( @xcite ; see also optically thin calculations for radio galaxies in manzini & di serego alighieri 1996 ) .",
    "the calculations presented here improve on these earlier calculations either by the use of an accurate radiative transfer , rather than a monte carlo calculation , or by using updated dielectric functions of silicate and graphite grains , by using the actual , rather than approximated scattering phase matrix , by extending our results down to 500  ( relevant for high redshift extra galactic objects ) , and by the detailed set of results presented .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we provide a detailed description of the theoretical approach .",
    "the results for scattering by optically thin dust , and by an optically thick slab and sphere are presented in  3 , and the paper is summarized in  4 .",
    "a detailed description of the numerical implementation is provided in the appendix , where we also provide tests of the codes based on a comparison with accurate analytic results for electron scattering , and with earlier numerical results for dust scattering .",
    "we also show in the appendix a comparison with the much simpler case of an electron scattering sphere .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study in detail the wavelength dependence of scattering and polarization of light incident on optically thick dust in simple geometrical configurations .",
    "the distance from the illumination source to the dusty nebula is assumed here to be much larger than the characteristic length corresponding to an optical depth @xmath3 within the dusty nebula , so one may use the parallel illumination assumption .",
    "dusty slabs or spheres are the simplest possible dust configurations to consider , and are relevant for the various optically thick scattering objects mentioned in  1 .",
    "radiative transfer in a plane - parallel slab is a standard problem in the theory of radiative transfer ( chandrasekhar @xcite ) . to solve this problem we use the adding - doubling method ( hovenier @xcite ; hansen & travis @xcite ; evans & stephens @xcite ) , which is efficient and numerically stable up to large optical depths .",
    "we follow the formulation of the adding - doubling method proposed by evans & stephens ( @xcite ) . to solve the case of an optically thick dusty sphere ,",
    "we assume that the geometrical depth at which @xmath3 is much smaller than the radius of the sphere , so the surface of the sphere can be treated as a collection of a large number of small plane - parallel slabs with a horizontal size much less than the sphere radius , but still much larger than the vertical depth at which @xmath3 .",
    "the scattering properties of the sphere are obtained by integrating the local solution for the slabs over the sphere surface .",
    "note that the surface integration approach can be applied to practically any optically thick geometry .",
    "light scattering by a sphere can also be calculated using the monte carlo method ( witt @xcite ) , as was done by code & whitney ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , the efficiency of the monte carlo method drops steeply at large optical depths , typically for @xmath4 510 ( fischer , henning , & yorke @xcite ; code & whitney @xcite ; wolf & henning @xcite ) , and it does not allow the accuracy provided by an exact numerical radiative transfer for a large optical depth .",
    "however , the disadvantage of the numerical scheme employed here for a sphere is that it applies only for @xmath5 , unlike the monte carlo method which allows one to treat spheres with intermediate optical depth .    in the following subsections we provide a detailed description of our theoretical approach .",
    "we first briefly review the basics of single scattering by ensembles of spherical grains ( section [ subsec : single_scat ] ) , introducing the phase matrix , albedo , and other parameters relevant for multiple scattering . in section [ subsec : mult_scat ]",
    "we describe the polarized radiative transfer in a slab , which provides the basis for this and forthcoming studies . in section [ subsubsec : math_formul ]",
    "we formulate the problem and introduce the main parameters .",
    "we next derive the expression for the scattering matrix ( section [ subsubsec : scat_mat ] ) in a form suitable for efficient implementation of the adding - doubling method , which is described in section [ subsubsec : doubl_add ] . in section [ subsec :",
    "scat_sphere ] , we describe how to calculate the scattering characteristics of an optically thick sphere using the solution for a slab .      in order to solve the radiative transfer in an extended dusty medium , it is necessary to obtain first the scattering properties per unit volume .",
    "if the mean distance between dust particles in the medium considerably exceeds the typical grain size , and the particles are randomly distributed ( as applies for cosmic dust ) , then there are no coherence effects and the particles scatter the light independently .",
    "the scattering also does not change the frequency .",
    "the transfer in larger , optically thick volumes , is studied by solving the equations of radiative transfer , using the results for the single scattering problem . in this section",
    "we introduce the main parameters which describe single scattering ; the intensity vector , the phase matrix and the single - scattering albedo .",
    "we next present specific expressions of these parameters for the cases of mie and rayleigh scattering relevant for the present study .",
    "the intensity and polarization of a beam of light are fully described by the 4-vector @xmath6 of stokes parameters @xmath7 ( chandrasekhar @xcite ; bohren & huffman @xcite ) , defined with respect to a certain plane of reference .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 describes the total light intensity , @xmath9 and @xmath10 describe the linear polarization , frequently expressed through the degree of linear polarization @xmath11 and the position angle of the direction of linear polarization with respect to the local meridian plane @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 has the same sign as @xmath9 .",
    "the last parameter , @xmath14 , describes the circular polarization , and the degree of circular polarization is @xmath15 .",
    "note that the intensity vector @xmath6 is actually _ a pseudo - vector _ , since it does not transform like a true vector under a coordinate transformation .",
    "it is possible to build the so - called radiation density matrix @xmath16 in terms of the stokes parameters ( dolginov , gnedin , & silantev @xcite ) @xmath17 ,    \\label{eq : hatrho}\\ ] ] which is _ a tensor _ in coordinate space .",
    "however , we base our calculations on the the intensity vector @xmath6 , as is common for cosmic dust studies .",
    "the scattering from a small volume is obtained by summing over the scatterings of the grains within that volume .",
    "we assume a model of spherical grains , which is frequently used in various applications .",
    "the approach we develop is applicable not only for classical homogeneous spherical grains ( mie particles ) , but also for spherical grains of multilayer or composite structure .",
    "if a grain of radius @xmath18 is illuminated by parallel radiation of intensity @xmath19 at a wavelength @xmath20 , then the intensity of the radiation scattered by the grain in the direction @xmath21 and measured at a distance @xmath22 in the far - field ( @xmath23 ) is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the scattering cross - section of the grain and @xmath26 is a 4-by-4 matrix called the phase matrix .",
    "since energy can be removed from the incident radiation by scattering as well as by absorption , it is important to introduce also the absorption and extinction cross - sections : @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "then we may define the so - called single - scattering albedo @xmath29 , which gives the probability that a photon hitting a grain will be scattered .",
    "it is common to use the dimensionless efficiency factors for scattering , absorption and extinction , defined as ratios of respective cross - sections to the grain geometrical cross - section , equal in our specific case to @xmath30 : @xmath31 and thus @xmath32 .",

    "the scattering plane , defined by the incoming and outgoing beams of light , is the plane of reference for the vectors of the stokes parameters .",
    "the element @xmath36 is the phase function , which describes the probability that the unpolarized incident light will be scattered in any specific direction .",
    "the phase matrix @xmath37 is therefore normalized such that @xmath38 the angular dependence of the phase function @xmath36 can be characterized by the so - called asymmetry parameter @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath39 ranges from 1 ( complete backscattering ) to 1 ( complete forward scattering ) with @xmath41 corresponding to isotropic scattering .",

    "this grid provides the input for the final code which integrates the slab results over the surface of a sphere and outputs the stokes vector as a function of scattering angle from the sphere .",
    "the accuracy of the radiative transfer calculations was verified by comparison to analytic results available for a rayleigh scattering atmosphere , and by comparison to earlier calculations for an mrn dusty sphere .",
    "we also used our code to obtain a simple analytic approximation for the flux transmitted through an electron scattering slab , which is accurate to 4% at all @xmath87 .    in this paper",
    "we used this set of codes to explore the effects of optical depth , scattering angles , and dust configuration ( slab or sphere ) , on the scattering and polarization properties of mrn dust from the near ir ( 1@xmath302 ) to the far uv ( 500   ) .",
    "we find that the scattered spectrum provides a sensitive probe for the optical depth of the scattering medium , while the polarization spectrum provides a probe of the dust model and scattering geometry , which is practically independent of optical depth .",
    "we provide maps of the linear and circular polarization for scattering from a sphere which may be useful for interpreting imaging spectropolarimetry of scattered light in a variety of galactic and extragalactic objects from the near ir to the far uv .",
    "the mrn model assumes spherical grains , but the fact that extinction in the galaxy induces polarization clearly indicates that this assumption is not valid .",
    "how does the grains non sphericity and alignment affects the scattering polarization ?",
    "an accurate answer requires detailed calculations which are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , we note that the amplitude of polarization induced by transmission through an optical depth of unity ( @xmath303% ) is about an order of magnitude smaller than the polarization induced by scattering .",
    "thus , it is plausible to assume that the observed level of non sphericity and alignment will not have a major effect on the results presented here .    in a following paper",
    "we explore the polarization signature of various dust models over a range of possible compositions and grain size distributions .",
    "we also plan to extend our code to handle other plausible geometries , such as a dusty disk and a dusty torus .",
    "we plan to make these codes publicly available , which will provide a useful tool for interpreting available spectropolarimetry results , and in particular , help justify new observations that can teach us about the properties of dust in various galactic and extragalactic environments .",

    "a package of programs was developed to implement the calculations described above .",
    "the core of the package is the code prt which calculates the polarized radiative transfer in a plane - parallel dusty slab using the adding - doubling method .",
    "the light scattering by an optically thick dusty sphere is calculated with the code prt - sph , using the results , obtained from prt .",
    "the codes were all written in the standard ansi c language , which allows a very efficient use of memory and cpu time .",

    "were adapted from rt3 , although the realization of our code is completely different from that of rt3 both in the general structure and in the details of the code .",
    "rt3 was also very valuable for checking prt during various steps of the its development .",
    "the formulation of the problem that prt solves is as follows . a plane - parallel slab is illuminated by unidirectional radiation from a point - like source and/or diffuse radiation from both above and/or below",
    ". the slab may be stratified , i.e. composed of a number of layers , each of which may be treated as homogeneous , having a specific geometrical thickness and dust grain composition .",
    "the dust in each layer may contain a number of size - distributed components , which may be spherical grains of various types : homogeneous , concentric multilayer and/or composite .",
    "the main task of prt is to compute the angular - dependent intensity vectors ( stokes vectors ) both for the radiation emergent from the upper and lower surface of the slab ( external problem ) and for the radiation at various levels inside the slab ( internal problem ) .",
    "prt solves this problem by the following algorithm :    1 .",

    "calculates the intensity vectors , both external and internal ; 5 .   converts the intensity vectors from fourier modes into azimuth space ; 6",
    ".   calculates and outputs fluxes of emergent radiation ;    the input includes one main file and a few additional smaller ( one per layer ) files .",
    "a typical main input file contains the following parameters : 1 .",
    "the number of quadrature angles , @xmath168 , normally 1624 ; 2 . the number of azimuth modes , @xmath198 , normally 424 , but may be larger if the phase function is strongly forward peaked ; 3 .",

    "quadrature scheme : gaussian or double gaussian ; 5 .",
    "the flux from the point source , @xmath82 , usually set to 1 , and its zenith angle , @xmath81 ; 6 .",
    "the temperature of the diffuse radiation , incoming from above and below , usually set to 0 k ; 7 .",
    "the optical thickness of the initial doubling layer , @xmath305 , usually 10@xmath30610@xmath307 ; 8 .",
    "the wavelength , @xmath20 ; 9 .",

    "contains : 1 . the dust mass density ; 2 .",
    "number of dust components ; 3 . for each dust component : type of grain constitution ( homogeneous , multilayer , composite ) , mass fraction in per cent , name of a file with the size distribution function , the number of grain constituents ( one for homogeneous grains ) , and for each grain constituent : name of the constituent and its volume fraction in the grain .",
    "the output includes the angular - dependent intensities and fluxes of the radiation at various depths in the slab . in the simplest case",
    ", only the intensities at the top and bottom are printed ( reflected and transmitted radiation ) .",
    "the results may be stored in text or in binary form .",
    "the binary form is especially suitable for use by other codes , e.g. when treating the light scattering by an optically thick sphere .",
    "it is possible to use the gaussian or the double gaussian quadrature schemes in prt .",
    "however , we have found that in order to produce results which are suitable for usage by prt - sph ( for calculating light scattering by a sphere ) the double gaussian scheme is more preferable , as it generates an angle grid which contains very small @xmath90 , which is necessary for prt - sph to work properly .",
    "the most important differences between the codes prt and rt3 are as follow .",
    "( 1 ) the memory for the multidimensional matrices and vectors in prt is allocated and freed dynamically , which provides the most efficient scheme of memory usage , while in rt3 the arrays are statically allocated .",
    "( 2 ) in prt , the scattering matrix for a specified dust grain mixture is calculated using the mie theory for individual grains summing over the mixtures components and grain - size distributions , whereas in rt3 the scattering matrix is computed from its expansion in legendre series in @xmath309 . ( 3 ) prt uses a more efficient realization of the fft procedure with less than 50 lines of c code , whereas the respective fortran code in the rt3 contains more than 250 lines .",
    "( 4 ) when performing adding and doubling [ eqs ( [ eq : adding ] ) ] and calculating the intensities of the radiation inside the slab [ eqs ( [ eq : i_inside ] ) ] , there is a need to work with inverted matrices .",
    "rt3 directly inverts matrices in these cases . in prt",
    ", we proceed more efficiently .",
    "since the inverted matrices in eqs ( [ eq : adding ] ) and ( [ eq : i_inside ] ) are combinations like @xmath310 or @xmath311 ( where @xmath312 and @xmath96 are matrices , @xmath313 is a vector ) , it is more computationally suitable to calculate @xmath310 or @xmath311 in the following way : first find the @xmath314-decomposition of matrix @xmath312 and then perform a backsubstitution with the columns of @xmath96 or @xmath313 ( see e.g. forsythe , malcolm , & moler @xcite ) .",
    "this is more accurate and saves one matrix multiplication .",
    "( 5 ) in addition to these differences , prt was written with the aim of making it more readable and logically organized , and thus the general structure of prt differs from rt3 .",
    "the improved computational scheme of prt allows standard mie theory solutions for grains with size parameters up to @xmath315 .",
    "thus , we do not need to resort to the rayleigh - gans or geometrical optics approximations ( bohren & huffman 1983 ) for any combination of grain sizes and wavelengths .",
    "the accuracy of the results generated by prt depends on the following parameters : the initial optical thickness for doubling @xmath305 , the number of quadrature angles @xmath168 , and the number of azimuth modes  @xmath198 . for a proper choice of @xmath168 , usually @xmath316 , and @xmath198 ,",
    "the accuracy is set by @xmath305 .",
    "for example , setting @xmath317 will result in 56 digit precision .",
    "typical values of running time and virtual memory , required by prt for various values of @xmath168 and @xmath198 are displayed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "these were derived by using a dusty layer of mrn dust .",
    "the results correspond to a calculation per one wavelength , @xmath20=0.5 @xmath90 m , and per one angle of incoming radiation , @xmath318 .",
    "the optical depth of the layer at @xmath20=0.5 @xmath90 m is @xmath319 ; @xmath305 for doubling was set to 10@xmath306 .",
    "the calculations have been performed at a dec alpha workstation 250@xmath320 .",
    "the program was compiled with a c compiler gnu gcc .",
    "the code prt - sph solves the following problem . a sphere of radius @xmath219 is illuminated by unpolarized radiation with flux @xmath82 from a point source ( see figure [ fig : coord_sphere ] ) , where the angle between the directions to the source and the observer is @xmath224 .",
    "the code prt - sph was designed to solve two main tasks : first , the computation of the linear and circular polarization maps that requires calculation of the local intensity vectors over the surface of the sphere , second , the calculation of the integrated characteristics : the intensity and the degree of linear polarization obtained by integrating the local intensities over the sphere .",

    "for the grid of 40@xmath33290 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 over the sphere , typical in our calculations , the accuracy of the results is better than 0.010.1% .",

    "for comparison , we plot the large-@xmath87 asymptotic analytic solution given by yanovitskij ( 1997 ) : @xmath335 we find an agreement to within 1% between the analytic and numerical solutions at @xmath3363 .    as a side note",
    ", we tried to use our numerical solution , which is exact at all @xmath87 , to obtain an improved analytic approximation which generalizes equation [ eq : f_large_tau ] to a larger range of @xmath87 .",

    "no flux is lost due to absorption , and thus energy conservation implies that the incident flux must equal the sum of transmitted and scattered fluxes .",
    "the right panel in figure [ fig : rayleigh2 ] shows the accuracy to which energy is conserved in prt .",

    "figure [ fig : rayleigh3 ] presents maps of the linear polarization of an optically thick electron scattering sphere , obtained with prt - sph .",
    "comparison with corresponding maps of dusty spheres ( figs [ fig : maps_0.0500][fig : maps_1.0000 ] ) indicates that , as expected , multiple scattering has a larger contribution to the polarization in the electron scattering sphere .",
    "for example , at @xmath224=180@xmath270 , the local degree of @xmath269 reaches 78% , which is twice the value for a dusty sphere , and a similar effect is seen at very small @xmath224 . on the other hand , the maximum local polarization ( at @xmath224=90@xmath270 ) , is 5560% which is significantly lower than the maximum values of up to 90% ( for @xmath20=0.05 @xmath90 m ) found for a dusty sphere .",
    "dust absorption enhances the polarization since it suppresses the contribution of multiple scattering , which adds unpolarized light , or light which is polarized at right angle to the single scattered light ( for @xmath224=90@xmath270 ) , in both cases lowering the total polarization .",
    "figure [ fig : rayleigh4 ] presents the integrated scattering characteristics of the electron scattering sphere in comparison to those of a dusty sphere .",
    "the electron scattering sphere scatters light more efficiently at most angles ( @xmath34320@xmath270 ) .",
    "its albedo is essentially unity , versus @xmath344% only for a dusty sphere .",
    "however , a dusty sphere is a much more efficient polarizer , allowing maximum @xmath293 of 7080% , versus only about 30% for the electron scattering sphere , again due to the greater contribution of multiple scattering in the later case .",
    "note that the integrated electron scattering sphere polarization is rotated by 90@xmath270 for @xmath224=0 - 20@xmath270 .",
    "this effect is not seen in the monte carlo calculations of code & whitney ( 1995 ) , most likely due to the very low intensity of light scattered at this range , coupled with the low polarization amplitude .",
    "this demonstrates the advantage of an accurate solution over monte carlo calculations , though the former is limited to the @xmath5 case only .",

    "<S> spectropolarimetry from the near ir to the far uv of light scattered by dust provides a valuable diagnostic of the dust composition , grain size distribution and spatial distribution . to facilitate the use of this diagnostic , we present detailed calculations of the intensity and polarization spectral signature of light scattered by optically thin and optically thick dust in various geometries . </S>",
    "<S> the polarized light radiative transfer calculations are carried out using the adding - doubling method for a plane - parallel slab , and are extended to an optically thick sphere by integrating over its surface . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are for the mathis , rumple & nordsieck galactic dust model , and cover the range from 1  @xmath0 to 500   .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the wavelength dependence of the scattered light intensity provides a sensitive probe of the optical depth of the scattering medium , while the polarization wavelength dependence provides a probe of the grain scattering properties , which is practically independent of optical depth . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a detailed set of predictions , including polarization maps , which can be used to probe the properties of dust through imaging spectropolarimetry in the near ir to far uv of various galactic and extragalactic objects . in a following paper </S>",
