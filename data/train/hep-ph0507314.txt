    "one of the primary objectives of ultrarelativistic heavy - ion collisions is to produce and study the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , a deconfined state of strongly interacting matter which is believed to have existed a few microseconds after the big bang .",
    "recent observations from the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic ) indicate that , in a temperature regime @xmath7  1 - 2  @xmath8 ( @xmath9 : ( pseudo- ) critical temperature  @xcite ) , the qgp is not the originally expected weakly interacting gas of quarks and gluons .",
    "these observations could , in fact , be related to recent results from lattice quantum chromodynamics ( lqcd ) which suggest the existence of resonance- ( or bound - state ) like hadronic states up to temperatures of @xmath10 , both in the heavy ( @xmath11 )  @xcite and light ( @xmath12 ) quark sector  @xcite .",
    "for charmonium states this opens the exciting possibility that a substantial part of the final yield arises from ( secondary ) recombination of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks in the qgp  @xcite ( or at the hadronization transition  @xcite ) , as opposed to the originally suggested signature of @xmath15 _ suppression _",
    "the effectiveness of recombination mechanisms in statistical and kinetic models sensitively resides on a thermal equilibration of the charm- ( @xmath13- ) quark momentum distributions in the qgp  @xcite . on the one hand ,",
    "kinetic @xmath13-quark equilibrium is not easily conceivable based on perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) cross sections with thermal light quarks and gluons  @xcite . on the other hand , a recent study based on resonant rescattering via `` @xmath16''-meson states in the qgp  @xcite found substantially smaller @xmath13-quark thermalization times ( by about a factor of @xmath17  3 compared to pqcd estimates ) , being comparable to or even below the expected qgp lifetime at rhic .",
    "thus , the question arises whether @xmath15 suppression , or rather the absence thereof , is an appropriate qgp signature at collider energies . at this point",
    ", the prospect of measuring @xmath0 states at rhic ( and lhc ) becomes particularly valuable .",
    "due to their large mass , @xmath3-quarks are not expected to kinetically equilibrate .",
    "together with their small production cross sections at rhic , the situation for bottom appears to be reminiscent to the charm sector at sps , in the sense that @xmath15 _ suppression _ has been verified as the dominant effect , with small contributions from regeneration  @xcite .    the main objective of this article is to quantify predictions for bottomonium production at collider energies under simultaneous inclusion of both dissociation and formation reactions .",
    "earlier analyses of bottomonium in heavy - ion reactions have essentially focused on suppression mechanisms , using either the debye - screening picture ( combined with formation time effects )  @xcite , or gluo - dissociation processes  @xcite , @xmath18  @xcite . in the present article",

    "we approximate these by the so - called nuclear absorption , which , in principle , can be extracted from data in @xmath36-@xmath29 collisions . again , this information is rather scarce .",
    "we therefore adopt the standard approach employed for charmonia , which consists of a constant ( high - energy ) nucleon - bottomonium absorption cross section , @xmath45 , coupled with a glauber model for the nuclear overlap function  @xcite .",
    "we note that , at collider energies , coherence effects may induce substantial deviations from the naive collision scaling  @xcite , typically amounting to a significant reduction in absorption .",
    "we therefore use rather conservative values for the absorption cross section of @xmath46  mb at rhic ( @xmath47  mb at lhc )  @xcite , which , for simplicity , is assumed to be identical for all bottomonium states .",

    "whenever possible , we will try to motivate necessary assumptions by findings of recent lqcd calculations ( see app .",
    "[ app_lqcd ] for a brief survey containing more details ) .",
    "the most commonly used process to evaluate the bottomonium ( or charmonium ) dissociation cross section , @xmath54 ( @xmath55=@xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) , on partons is the qcd analogue of photo - dissociation , @xmath56  @xcite . in fig .",

    "it is peaked around @xmath63  gev , which for moderate plasma temperatures , @xmath7  300  mev , is significantly above average thermal gluon energies , @xmath64 ; in other words , the maximum of the cross section has rather little overlap with the phase - space weighted thermal gluon distribution , @xmath65 ( dash - dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig_sig - diss ] ) .",
    "while an increase in @xmath66 and a reduction in binding energy ( as expected from color - screening ) initially improves the overlap , a small value of @xmath67 ( toward / close to the dissolution point ) eventually leads to a very narrow energy interval where the cross section is active ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig_sig - diss ] ) and thus renders gluo - dissociation increasingly inefficient .",
    "formally this is due to the fact that for a loosely bound ( large - size ) @xmath3-@xmath21 system , the absorption of a hard gluon essentially occurs on a single @xmath3-quark , in which case energy - momentum conservation can not be satisfied , and higher orders in the multipole expansion have to be included .",

    "the reaction is considered to lead to @xmath55 breakup , @xmath70 , if the residual binding energy can be overcome ( and conserve overall four - momentum ) .",
    "note that in this approach also thermal ( anti- ) quarks contribute to bottomonium dissociation via @xmath71-channel gluon - exchange .",

    "the result for the quasifree dissociation cross section of @xmath58 with in - medium binding energy ( solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig_sig - diss ] ) shows a much improved overlap with thermal distributions due to its monotonous rise with gluon energy .",
    "the threshold for the result shown is due to a combination of binding energy and thermal parton masses ; for massive partons , necessary to reproduce the qgp equation of state , the efficiency of gluo - dissociation is even more suppressed if @xmath74 .",
    "in addition , the quasifree cross section is theoretically better controlled for small values of the binding energy than gluo - dissociation since its main contribution arises from gluons with relatively large ( thermal ) energies , @xmath75 .",
    "its applicability therefore also encompasses excited bottomonia .",
    "to evaluate bottomonium suppression in the plasma , the inelastic cross section , @xmath54 , is converted into a dissociation rate @xmath76 ( or inverse lifetime @xmath77 ) by convoluting it with thermal distributions , @xmath78 , of quarks and gluons , @xmath79 here , @xmath80 denotes the total center - of - mass ( cm ) energy squared of the collision of a @xmath55 at rest ( @xmath81 ) with a thermal on - shell parton of four - momentum @xmath82 .",

    "are in order : ( i ) at the highest temperatures the @xmath55 lifetimes are larger than the ones calculated with gluo - dissociation using vacuum binding energies .",
    "the main reason for this is that the strong coupling constant , @xmath23 , inherent in the @xmath3-@xmath21 cornell potential necessary to reproduce bottomonium spectroscopy ( which also enters the dissociation cross sections ) , is substantially larger ( @xmath170.5 ) than in the quasifree calculation ( @xmath170.26 ) .",

    "( ii ) at temperatures @xmath93(200 )  mev the gluo - dissociation rates for @xmath0 ( @xmath2 , @xmath1 ) using in - medium binding energies are not much smaller than the ones obtained with quasifree destruction .",
    "therefore , both contributions to the rate should , in principle , be accounted for ( at higher @xmath66 , gluo - dissociation with in - medium @xmath67 is negligible ) . however , since we have fixed @xmath23 in the charmonium sector using the quasifree process alone to reproduce @xmath15 data in pb - pb collisions at the sps , we will refrain from adding the two contributions .",
    "in addition , as we will see below , most of the bottomonium suppression at rhic and lhc occurs at temperatures above @xmath17250  mev .",
    "unless otherwise specified , in the following we will use the bottomonium lifetimes pertaining to the quasifree mechanism with in - medium binding energies as our default scenario ( we recall that this should provide an upper estimate of the screening effects ) . for comparison purposes with existing literature",

    "the underlying rate equation requires several inputs : ( 1 ) initial bottomonium abundances ( which we estimated from collision - scaled @xmath36-@xmath36 data ) , ( 2 ) space - time evolution of temperature ( for which we employed an expanding fireball model ) , ( 3 ) inelastic reaction rates of bottomonia , and ( 4 ) bottomonium equilibrium abundances .    for the inelastic reaction rates we have evaluated two mechanisms for dissociation due to thermal light quarks and gluons in the qgp : ( i ) gluo - absorption ( the analogue of photo - dissociation ) and ( ii ) `` quasifree '' scattering of both quarks and gluons off individual @xmath3 and @xmath21-quarks in the bound state .",
    "whereas processes of type ( i ) are appropriate ( and expected to be dominant ) for deeply bound quarkonia , processes ( ii ) allow to treat the case of small binding energies ( where gluo - dissociation leads to anomalously small reaction rates ) .",

    "the equilibrium limits of bottomonia , which govern the gain term ( regeneration ) in the rate equation , follow the trends previously established for charmonia : for a fixed number of @xmath24 pairs in the system ( at given centrality ) , larger masses ( and smaller degeneracies ) of open - bottom states imply larger @xmath55-equilibrium limits ( rendering bottomonium formation more favorable ) .",
    "however , in most cases considered ( in particular when implementing medium effects with relatively small @xmath3-quark masses ) the equilibrium limit was significantly below the initial value from hard production ( after nuclear absorption ) , especially after applying a schematic correction for incomplete @xmath3-quark thermalization .",
    "our main results may therefore be summarized as follows : ( i ) color - screening ( _ i.e. _ , in - medium reduced binding energies ) leads to a substantial increase of the inelastic bottomonium reaction rates ; ( ii ) at rhic , this manifests itself as a 50% suppression effect ( factor @xmath172 ) in the qgp phase ( with virtually no regeneration ) , whereas for vacuum @xmath0 states almost no ( thermal ) suppression occurs ( in which case suppression in inclusive yields is due to feeddown from excited states ) ; ( iii ) at lhc , assuming @xmath145 in central pb - pb , the net qgp suppression becomes substantially stronger ( factor @xmath177 ( 1.4 ) for in - medium ( vacuum ) binding energies ) , with the final yield containing a 75% ( 30% ) component of regenerated @xmath0 s . if the charged - particle multiplicity turns out to be smaller ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath146 ) , the reduced qgp initial temperature and lifetime will lead to weaker net suppression ( _ e.g. _ , factor @xmath172 less ) .",
    "our general finding is thus that in heavy - ion reactions at _ both _ rhic and lhc , @xmath0 suppression is the prevalent effect as a function of collision centrality , and there is large sensitivity to color - screening in the qgp .",

    ", @xmath119 increases significantly due to a decreasing @xmath212 , and one notices the onset of the effect that , in the canonical ensemble ( where @xmath3 and @xmath21 have to appear together ) , it becomes increasingly favorable to have a @xmath24 pair in an @xmath0 state which has a lower mass than separate @xmath3 and @xmath21 quarks ( the vertical decrease of @xmath213 at @xmath8 is a consequence of the volume expansion during the mixed phase at constant temperature , implying a decrease in @xmath119 )",

    "close to @xmath8 , the scenarios with hadronic open - bottom states , ( iii ) and ( iv ) , lead to a substantial increase in @xmath213 over the one with in - medium @xmath3-quark mass , since the latter is well below the lowest @xmath4-meson mass .",
    "the sensitivity to higher - mass bottom hadrons becomes more pronounced with increasing temperature where they are more easily excited , thus reducing the number of bottomonium states .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the @xmath3-quark scenario ( i ) , with @xmath214 ( not shown in fig.[fig_open ] ) , is rather similar to the hadronic scenarios close to @xmath8 .",
    "we finally note that , during the mixed phase ( _ i.e. _ , at @xmath8 ) , the open - bottom spectrum within each scenario is assumed not to change . with constant temperature and increasing 3-volume , @xmath215",

    "the discontinuity in the first derivative of the temperature evolution ( cf .",
    "[ fig_temp - profil ] ) at the beginning of the mixed phase is thus reflected in @xmath216 and @xmath217 .      due to the rather short duration of a few fm / c of the high - temperature ( qgp ) phases in urhic s , and a @xmath3-quark mass that exceeds expected early temperatures by a large factor",

    "however , recent rhic data  @xcite on the elliptic flow of ( semileptonic ) decay electrons which are attributed to @xmath16-mesons suggest that charm quarks undergo substantial rescattering  @xcite in semi - central au - au collisions at @xmath218  agev .",

    "it was found that , compared to perturbative calculations , the thermal relaxation times could be reduced by up to a factor of 3 - 4 , thus becoming comparable to the duration of the qgp phase at rhic .",
    "a similar reduction was found for bottom quarks , but with the larger mass implying larger absolute values for the relaxation time scale by a factor of @xmath172 - 3 , so that @xmath3-quark thermalization remains unlikely at rhic .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0-equilibrium abundances shown in fig .  [ fig_open ] should be improved by accounting for incomplete thermalization . as in ref .",

    "we will employ the rates corresponding to quasifree destruction with in - medium binding energies ( even though this implies an inconsistency between the rates and the @xmath0 equilibrium number , it will allow us to estimate the maximal possible effect as the quasifree rates are the largest considered in this work ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : regeneration - scenarios - known ] pertains to the case where the open - bottom states in the qgp are given by the known @xmath4-hadron spectrum . since their mass tends to be larger than the in - medium @xmath3-quark masses ( as used in the main text , cf .",
    "[ fig : gluo - evol - quasi - rhic ] ) , this scenario leads to an increase in the @xmath0-equilibrium abundances ( light vs. dark dash - dotted curves in fig .",

    "however , the overall effect of a slightly enhanced regeneration is small ( upper solid line ) .",
    "if we assume the open - bottom spectrum to follow the same pattern as all known charmed hadrons , the increase in the @xmath0-equilibrium number over the in - medium @xmath3-quark scenario is less pronounced ( due to a smaller fugacity , @xmath119 , relative to using only known @xmath4-states ) , and , consequently , also the regeneration , leaving essentially no noticeable effect , cf .",

    "the results are summarized in figs .",
    "[ fig : thermal - off - eq - rhic ] and [ fig : thermal - off - eq - lhc ] . even though the relative increase in @xmath115 is substantial , its impact at rhic ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thermal - off - eq - rhic ] ) is still rather limited ( @xmath1720% ) since it becomes comparable to initial hard production ( after nuclear absorption ) only after @xmath226  fm / c when the temperature has dropped below 200  mev and consequently the reaction rates have become small , cf .",
    "[ fig : rates - quasifree ] .    at lhc",
    "[ fig : thermal - off - eq - lhc ] ) , even though the relative increase in @xmath115 is smaller than at rhic ( since the @xmath3-quark relaxation time is smaller at larger temperatures ) , its absolute number is now closer to the actual @xmath0 number , @xmath227 , in the system , especially at intermediate times in the qgp evolution ( @xmath228  2 - 4  fm / c ) . since the reaction rates at this stage are still sizable , the final number in the thermal - equilibrium scenario increases by about a factor of 2 over the off - equilibrium case",
    "nevertheless , the main feature of a strong suppression is preserved ( about a factor of 3 ) , while the final yield is composed to about @xmath1790% of regenerated @xmath0 s .",
