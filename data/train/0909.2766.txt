    "the structure of loosely bound and unbound nuclei is strongly impacted by many - body correlations and non - perturbative coupling to the external environment of scattering states and decay channels @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important in exotic nuclei where new phenomena , at the borderline of nuclear structure and nuclear reactions , are expected . some of them , like the halos @xcite , the segregation of time scales in the context of non - hermitian hamiltonians @xcite , the alignment of near - threshold states with decay channels @xcite , and the resonance crossings @xcite appear in various _ open _ mesoscopic systems .",
    "their universality is the consequence of the non - hermitian nature of an eigenvalue problem in open quantum systems .",
    "resonances are commonly found in quantum systems , independently of their interactions , building blocks and energy scales involved .",
    "much interest is concentrated on resonance degeneracies , the so - called exceptional points ( eps ) @xcite .",
    "their connection to avoided crossings and spectral properties of hermitian systems @xcite as well as the associated geometric phases have been discussed in simple models in considerable detail @xcite .",
    "the interesting question is their manifestation in nuclear scattering experiments . here ,",
    "a much studied case was the @xmath1 doublet in @xmath2be @xcite . based on this example",
    ", von brentano @xcite discussed the width attraction for mixed resonances , and hernandz and mondragn @xcite showed that the true crossing of resonances can be obtained by the variation of two parameters in the jordan block of rank two . in this latter analysis , it was shown that the resonating part of the scattering matrix ( s - matrix ) for one open channel and two internal states is compatible with the two - level formula of the r - matrix theory used in the experimental analysis of excitation functions of elastic scattering @xmath3he(@xmath4)@xmath3he @xcite and , hence , the @xmath1 doublet in @xmath2be may actually be close to the true resonance degeneracy .",
    "properties of atomic nucleus around the continuum threshold change rapidly with the nucleon number , the excitation energy and the coupling to the environment of scattering states . a consistent description of the interplay between scattering and resonant states requires an open system formulation of the nuclear shell model ( see @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "the real - energy continuum shell model @xcite provides a suitable unified framework with the help of an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian . in this work , for the first time we focus on a realistic model of an unbound atomic nucleus to see whether one or more eps can appear in the low energy continuum for sensible parameters of the open quantum system hamiltonian .",
    "in particular , we discuss possible experimental signatures of the eps and show the evolution of these signatures in the vicinity of the ep . finally , on the example of spectroscopic factors we demonstrate the entanglement of resonance wave functions close to the ep .",
    "let us briefly review the shell model embedded in the continuum ( smec ) @xcite , which is a recent realization of the real - energy continuum shell model .",
    "the total function space of an @xmath5particle system consists of the set of square - integrable functions @xmath6 , used in the standard nuclear shell model ( sm ) , and the set of embedding scattering states @xmath7 .",
    "these two sets are obtained by solving the schrdinger equation , separately for discrete ( sm ) states ( the closed quantum system ) and for scattering states ( the environment ) .",
    "decay channels @xmath8 are determined by the motion of an unbound particle in a state @xmath9 relative to the @xmath10 nucleus with all nucleons on bounded single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "orbits in the sm eigenstate @xmath11 . using these function sets , one defines projection operators : @xmath12 and projected hamiltonians : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "assuming @xmath17 , one can determine the third set of functions @xmath18 which contains the continuation of any sm eigenfunction @xmath19 in @xmath20 , and then construct the complete solution in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "recently , this approach has been extended to describe the two - proton radioactivity with the two - particle continuum @xcite .",
    "open quantum system solutions in @xmath22 , which include couplings to the environment of scattering states and decay channels , are obtained by solving the eigenvalue problem for the energy - dependent effective hamiltonian : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the closed system hamiltonian , @xmath25 is the green function for the motion of a single nucleon in @xmath20 subspace and @xmath26 is the energy of this nucleon ( the scattering energy ) .",

    "the eigenstates of @xmath28 are biorthogonal ; the left @xmath29 and right @xmath31 eigenstates have the wave functions related by the complex conjugation .",
    "the orthonormality condition in the biorthogonal basis reads : @xmath32 .",
    "similarly , the matrix element of an operator @xmath33 is @xmath34 .",
    "the scattering function @xmath35 is a solution of a schrdinger equation in the total function space : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 inside of an interaction region , the dominant contributions to @xmath35 are given by eigenfunctions @xmath39 of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath40 for bounds states , eigenvalues @xmath41 of @xmath42 are real and @xmath43 . for unbound states , physical resonances can be identified with the narrow poles of the s - matrix @xcite , or using the breit - wigner approach which leads to a fixed - point condition @xcite : @xmath44 here it is assumed that the origin of @xmath45 is fixed at the lowest particle emission threshold .",
    "the position of eps in the spectrum of eigenvalues of @xmath28 depends both on the chosen interaction and the energy @xmath26 of the system . in general , eigenvalues of the energy - dependent effective hamiltonian @xmath42 need not satisfy the fixed - point condition ( [ eq1 ] ) and hence need not correspond to poles of the s - matrix ( resonances ) . in the following , we shall consider uniquely the case where eps are _ identical _ with double - poles of the s - matrix .",
    "let us investigate properties of eps on the example of @xmath55ne .",
    "sm eigenstates in this nucleus correspond to a complicated mixture of configurations associated with the dynamics of the @xmath55o core .",
    "our goal is to see if eps can be possibly found in the scattering continuum of atomic nucleus at low excitation energies and for physical strength of the continuum coupling .",
    "smec calculations are performed in @xmath56 model space .",
    "for @xmath24 we take the zbm hamiltonian @xcite which correctly describes the configuration mixing around @xmath57 shell closure .",
    "the residual coupling @xmath58 between @xmath22 and the embedding continuum @xmath20 is generated by the contact force : @xmath59 . for each @xmath60 ,",

    "the size of a non - hermitian correction to @xmath24 depends on two real parameters : the strength @xmath66 of the continuum coupling in @xmath58 ( @xmath67 ) and the system energy @xmath26 .",
    "the range of relevant @xmath66 values can be determined , for example , by fitting decay widths of the lowest states in @xmath68f . for the present hamiltonian ,",
    "experimental decay widths of the ground state @xmath69 and the first excited state @xmath70 in @xmath68f are reproduced using @xmath71 mev@xmath72@xmath73 and @xmath74 mev@xmath72@xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the error bars in @xmath66 reflect experimental uncertainties of those widths .",
    "the weak dependence of 1p  decay widths on the sign of @xmath66 is generated by the channel - channel coupling and disappears in a single - channel case .",

    "one should stress that the passage through ep always occurs if , e.g. , the real - energy crossing moves towards @xmath65 .",

    "the qualitative features of the cross sections for the subcritical ( @xmath116 mev@xmath72@xmath73 ) and overcritical ( @xmath117 mev@xmath72@xmath73 ) couplings remain same as for the critical coupling ( see fig .",

    "the spectroscopic factors for @xmath129 and @xmath130 wavefunctions diverge at the ep ( the double - pole of the s - matrix ) but their sum ( long - dashed line in fig .",
    "9 ) remains finite and constant over a whole region of scattering energies surrounding the ep . in that sense , @xmath129 and @xmath130 resonance wavefunctions form an inseparable doublet of eigenfunctions with entangled spectroscopic factors",
    "this entanglement is a direct consequence of the energy dependence of coefficients @xmath131 : @xmath132 in a decomposition of @xmath42 eigenstates in the basis of sm eigenstates .",
    "one may notice that the energy dependence of re(@xmath125 ) in the vicinity of the double - pole for @xmath95 and @xmath96 eigenstates is quite different in all three regimes of the continuum coupling .",
    "in particular , in the overcritical regime of coupling , an ep yields entangled states in a broad range of scattering energies . the strongest entanglement is found at the scattering energy which corresponds to the point of the closest approach of eigenvalues in the complex plane for all regimes of coupling .",
    "obviously , the entanglement of resonance eigenfunctions in the vicinity of an ep is a generic phenomenon in open quantum systems which is manifested in matrix elements and expectation values for any operator which does not commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown in smec studies of the one - nucleon continuum that eps exist for realistic values of the continuum coupling strength . in the studied case of @xmath55ne , few of those eps appear at sufficiently low excitation energies to be seen in the excitation function as individual peaks associated with a jump by @xmath0 of the elastic scattering phase shift .",
    "the occurrence of an ep leaves also characteristic imprints in its neighborhood , i.e. for avoided crossing of resonances . in all close - to - critical regimes of the continuum coupling where real and/or imaginary parts of the two eigenvalues coincide ,",
    "one finds qualitatively similar features of the elastic scattering phase shift and the elastic cross - section as found for the critical coupling at around the ep ( the double - pole of the s - matrix ) .",
    "this gives a real chance that eps or their traces may actually be searched for experimentally in the atomic nucleus .",
    "the well - known case of @xmath1 doublet in @xmath2be , where resonance energies and widths are @xmath133 kev , @xmath134 kev and @xmath135 kev , @xmath136 kev , respectively @xcite , nearly satisfies the resonance conditions in the close - to - critical regime of couplings .",
    "various situations in this regime have been studied experimentally in the microwave cavity @xcite .    avoided crossing of two resonances with the same quantum numbers",
    "provide the valuable information about the configuration mixing in open quantum systems .",
    "as the formation of any ep in the scattering continuum depends on a subtle interplay between internal hamiltonian ( @xmath24 ) and the coupling to the external environment of decay channels , its finding provides a stringent test of an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction and the configuration mixing in the open quantum system regime .",
