    "supersymmetry cures the naturalness / hierarchy problem associated with the quadratically divergent 1-loop corrections to the higgs boson mass via the introduction of superpartners for each sm particle .",
    "so long as the superpartners have mass somewhat below @xmath3 , the cancellation is not particularly extreme and the hierarchy / naturalness problem associated with the quadratic divergences is ameliorated .",
    "however , there remains the question of how finely the gut - scale parameters must be adjusted in order to get appropriate electroweak symmetry breaking , that is to say correctly predict the observed value of @xmath4 .",
    "lep limits on a sm - like higgs boson play a crucial role here .",
    "supersymmetric models most naturally predict that the lightest higgs boson , generically @xmath5 , has couplings to @xmath1 and @xmath6 pairs of sm strength ( such an @xmath5 is termed sm - like ) and that it has a mass closely correlated to @xmath4 , typically lying in the range @xmath7 for stop masses @xmath8 , with an upper bound , for example , of @xmath9 in the mssm for stop masses @xmath10 and large stop mixing .",
    "if the stop masses are large , the predicted value of @xmath4 is very sensitive to the gut scale parameters .",
    "such sensitivity is termed ` fine tuning ' .",
    "models with minimal fine tuning provide a much more natural explanation of the @xmath11 mass than those with a high level of fine tuning .",
    "the degree of fine tuning required is thus quite closely related to the constraints on a sm - like @xmath5 , and these in turn depend on how it decays .",
    "the sm and the mssm predict that @xmath12 decays are dominant and lep has placed strong constraints on @xmath13 .",
    "the limits on the effective coupling ( hbb ) are such that @xmath14 is excluded for a sm - like @xmath5 that decays primarily to @xmath15 . for @xmath16 ,",
    "most of cp - conserving mssm parameter space is ruled out by this lep limit .",
    "there are three surviving parts of mssm parameter space .",
    "the first such part is characterized by at least one large stop mass at or above a @xmath17 at scale @xmath4 . in this case , it is always the case that to predict the observed @xmath4 requires very careful adjustment ,  fine tuning , of the gut - scale parameters ( either the higgs mass - squared or @xmath18 ) with accuracies better than 1% ( the smaller the percentage accuracy required , the more fine - tuned is the model ) .",
    "the second part of mssm parameter space that is consistent with lep limits by virtue of having @xmath19 is that with large mixing in the stop sector (  large @xmath20 ) , where @xmath21^{1/2 } \\gsim 300\\gev$ ] and @xmath22 ( at scale @xmath4 ) .",
    "this was explored in our previous paper , where we found that fine tuning could be improved to about the @xmath23 level .",
    "the third part of mssm parameter space consistent with lep limits is that where strong mixing between the two cp - even scalars of the model takes place , as arises when the cp - odd @xmath24 has mass @xmath25 . in this region ,",
    "the lightest cp - even higgs has mass somewhat below the sm lep limit of @xmath0 , as allowed by virtue of reduced @xmath1 coupling due to the mixing , and the heavier cp - even higgs boson has mass slightly above this value .",
    "a mass @xmath26 is achieved by virtue of both the effects of higgs mixing and large radiative corrections from the stop sector . however , because of the higgs mixing the latter stop sector corrections need not be as large as in the parts of parameter space for which @xmath19 . in the first part of this paper , we explore this third sector of mssm parameter space in detail .",
    "it is characterized by the extension of the first two regions to smaller stop masses or to smaller @xmath20 .",
    "the first region is extended to stop masses of @xmath27 , leading to fine tuning of order @xmath28 .",
    "the second region is extended to somewhat smaller @xmath29 and significantly smaller ratio of @xmath20 , for which we find that the gut scale parameters must be chosen with an accuracy of at least @xmath30 .",
    "this is a significant decrease of fine tuning relative to the other cases .    in the second part of the paper ,",
    "we consider mixed - higgs scenarios in the next - to - minimal supersymmetric model ( nmssm ) yielding a lightest higgs boson @xmath31 with @xmath32 that escapes lep limits by virtue of higgs mixing yielding reduced @xmath33 coupling .",
    "two basic types of higgs mixing can yield reduced @xmath33 coupling while keeping fine tuning to a not too unacceptable level : i ) mixing of the two doublet higgs fields analogous to mssm mixed - higgs scenarios ; and ii ) mixing of the doublet higgs fields with the singlet higgs field . in nmssm case",
    "i ) , our scans have found parameters yielding mssm - like mixed - higgs scenarios with the same level of fine tuning as in mixed - higgs mssm scenarios ,  @xmath34 . in nmssm case ii ) , we find it is also possible to reduce the gut - scale parameter tuning required for correct ewsb to the level of @xmath34 . we will present details of higgs masses and gut - scale parameters associated with these scenarios .    although not the focus of this paper , the nmssm mixed - higgs scenarios should always be thought of in comparison to the very natural @xmath35 fine - tuning scenarios where the @xmath31 is very sm - like and has mass @xmath36 . in this case , see @xcite , the @xmath31 evades lep limits by virtue of its primary decay being @xmath37 where @xmath38 so that the rate for @xmath39 ( where @xmath40 refers to any final state with 2 or more @xmath40 ) is small .",
    "the attractiveness of this scenario is not only that it is not at all fine - tuned , but also : i ) a sm - like higgs with mass near @xmath41 is strongly preferred by precision electroweak measurements ; and ii ) these scenarios with large @xmath42 typically predict  @xcite an excess in the @xmath43 quite consistent with well - known @xmath44 excess in the lep data for @xmath45  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , there are no current limits on the @xmath46 final state for @xmath47 @xcite . and limits in the case of @xmath48 run out at still lower @xmath49 .    in order to quantify fine tuning ,",
    "we employ the measure f_p f_p _ p|dd p| , [ fdef ] where the parameters @xmath50 comprise all gut - scale soft - susy - breaking parameters .",
    "above , we used @xmath51 in percent to express the degree of fine tuning .",
    "the larger the fine - tuning @xmath52 , the more finely the most sensitive gut - scale parameter must be tuned ( adjusted ) as a percentage of its nominal value .",
    "while there are many earlier papers that have considered mixed - higgs scenarios in the context of both the mssm  @xcite and nmssm ( or other singlet extensions of the mssm )  @xcite , most did not consider the fine tuning issue .",
    "only a few papers  @xcite have studied the correlations between fine tuning and higgs mixing .",
    "this paper will extend these latter studies , fully exploring all of parameter space .",
    "in the mssm , the cp - even higgs mass - squared matrix in the basis ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 ) is given as : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the mass of the cp odd higgs boson , @xmath57 is the mass of the z boson , @xmath58 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets and we use the shorthand notation @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "finally , @xmath61 is the susy correction to the 2 - 2 element of @xmath62 which is dominated by the contributions from stop loops and thus depends on stop masses and the mixing in the stop sector .",
    "it is the size of this correction which is relevant for the discussion of fine tuning of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the mass eigenstates are defined as follows : @xmath63 and the coupling squared of the lighter cp - even higgs boson to @xmath1 divided by the standard model value is given as : @xmath64 ( note that in the notation of the nmssm section of this paper , an equivalent notation would be @xmath65 in place of @xmath66 . ) introducing a dimensionless quantity : @xmath67 and assuming @xmath68 we can rewrite the cp - even higgs mass - squared matrix as : @xmath69 let us discuss the higgs sector in two limits :    * @xmath70  decoupled higgs scenario : the lighter cp - even higgs boson originates from @xmath54 , @xmath71 , its mass is @xmath72 and it has sm - like @xmath1 coupling , @xmath73 .",
    "* @xmath74  mixed - higgs scenario : the lighter cp - even higgs boson originates mainly from @xmath53 , @xmath75 , and it has reduced @xmath1 coupling , @xmath76 .",
    "the heavier higgs originates from @xmath54 , its mass is @xmath77 and it has sm - like @xmath1 coupling .    without off diagonal elements ( mixing ) in the higgs mass - squared matrix , both scenarios require exactly the same size for the susy correction , @xmath61 , and thus the same level of ewsb fine tuning , in spite of the fact that in the mixed - higgs scenario the lighter higgs is well below the lep limit of 114.4 gev on the sm higgs boson .",
    "the reason is that it is the sm - like higgs ( the higgs with near maximal @xmath1 coupling ) which has to be pushed above the lep limit irrespectively of the fact that it is the heavier of the two .",
    "the off diagonal element in the higgs mass - squared matrix makes the heavier eigenvalue heavier and the lighter eigenvalue lighter and thus , while in the usual decoupled scenario it decreases the mass of the sm - like higgs boson , in the mixed - higgs scenario it increases the mass of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "thus , in the presence of mixing , the susy correction from the stop sector does not have to be as large in the mixed - higgs scenario as in the decoupled scenario .",
    "however , the mixing can be used to increase the higgs boson mass only to some extent .",
    "first of all , the mixing term is proportional to @xmath78 and so for small or large @xmath79 it is negligible . for moderate @xmath80 , @xmath1 couples almost entirely to @xmath54 , but the mixing term in @xmath62 can still lead to the @xmath1 coupling being shared between the two higgs mass eigenstates",
    ". however , the off - diagonal term can not be too large without the light , mainly @xmath53 , mass state having a @xmath66 that exceeds the very strong limits on this quantity for any higgs with mass well below the lep limit .    for given @xmath79 and @xmath56 we can determine the minimal value of the susy correction needed for both scenarios to be viable . in fig .",

    ", the mass of the light cp - even higgs boson does not depend on @xmath56 and the mass of the heavy cp - even higgs boson scales linearly with @xmath56 .",
    "the masses of both higgses increase with increased radiative correction to the 2 - 2 element of the higgs mass - squared matrix .",
    "we see that the mixed - higgs scenario is viable for @xmath86 while the decoupled scenario requires @xmath87 .",
    "thus , the mixed - higgs scenario requires a somewhat smaller contribution from the stop sector . on the other hand , this scenario works only in a limited range of @xmath56 since the soft - susy - breaking parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 have to be carefully adjusted relative to one another given the relation @xmath90 at tree level for @xmath68 . in the above equation , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are the weak - scale values .",
    "the particular values to which they evolve at the gut scale will depend on many of the other weak - scale parameters .",
    "thus , in order to achieve the required relation of eq .",
    "( [ marel ] ) , all of the various gut - scale parameters will have to be closely correlated in a very particular way .",
    "furthermore , as we will see , the improvement in naturalness is limited to a very small window in @xmath79 , which implies also a small window for the @xmath91 parameter due to the relation @xmath92     ( green ) , @xmath82 ( blue ) and @xmath66 ( red ) in the @xmath56  @xmath83 plane for @xmath84 .",

    "<S> we study scenarios in the minimal and next - to minimal supersymmetric models in which the lightest cp - even higgs boson can have mass below the @xmath0 standard model lep limit by virtue of reduced @xmath1 coupling due to substantial mixing among the higgs bosons . </S>",
    "<S> we pay particular attention to the size of corrections from superpartners needed for these scenarios to be viable and point to boundary conditions at large scales which lead to these scenarios while at the same time keeping electroweak fine tuning modest in size . </S>",
    "<S> we find that naturalness of electroweak symmetry breaking in the mixed - higgs scenarios of both models points to the same region of soft supersymmetry breaking terms , namely those leading to large mixing in the stop sector at the electroweak scale , especially if we also require that the lightest cp - even higgs explains the higgs - like lep events at @xmath2 . </S>"
