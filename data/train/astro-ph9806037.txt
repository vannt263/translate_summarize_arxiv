    "anisotropies in the cosmic background radiation ( cbr ) are a strong potential source of information on the cosmological model .",
    "unfortunately , anisotropy observations are hard and significant measures were obtained only recently . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the theory of cbr anisotropies is well understood ( see , e.g. , hu & sugiyama 1995 and references therein ) and public numerical codes allow to calculate the expected anisotropies for a wide range of cases ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "it is then easy to see that cbr anisotropies depend on all the ingredients that define a cosmological model : the background metric , the substance mix and the primeval fluctuation spectrum .",
    "several authors used available codes to predict cbr features for suitable ranges of model parameters . however , within the range of models consistent with the inflationary paradigm , not enough attention , in our opinion , has been devoted yet to mixed models .",
    "anisotropies expected for them were calculated by ma & betschinger ( 1995 ) , de gasperis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , dodelson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , but parameter choices were restricted to cases for which anisotropies only marginally differ from the standard cdm case . here we plan to extend the analysis to a wider set of mixed models including those for which a greater discrepancy from standard cdm can be expected and , in particular , models with primeval spectral index @xmath0 and late derelativization of the hot component .",
    "if hot dark matter ( hdm ) is made of massive @xmath13 s , there is a precise constraint between its density parameter ( @xmath9 ) and its derelativization redshift ( @xmath3 ) : @xmath14 ( see eqs .",
    "2.32.4 below ; @xmath15 is the number of @xmath13 spin states ) .",
    "henceforth , in order to have @xmath160.15 , @xmath3 can not be lower than @xmath17 , even for @xmath18 . in order to have lower @xmath3 and/or greater @xmath9",
    ", hdm must arise from the decay products of heavier particles .",
    "in fact , decay products have extra kinetic energy arising from mother particle mass energy and therefore have a later @xmath3 .",
    "several authors considered such scenario , assuming the decay of a heavier neutrino into a lighter one ( bond & efstathiou 1991 , dodelson et al .",
    "1994 , white et al .",
    "1995 , mcnally & peacock 1995 , ghizzardi @xmath19 bonometto 1996 ) , and there are recent attempts of constraining it using cbr data ( hannestad 1998 ) .",
    "however , a wider range of models give rise to similar pictures , @xmath20 , if metastable supersymmetric particles decay into lighter ones ( bonometto et al .",
    ", 1994 ; borgani et al . 1996 ) . in a number of recent papers hdm arising from decays",
    "was called @xmath21 , to stress its capacity to grant a later derelativization , which weakens its contribution to the formation of inhomogeneities .",
    "cbr anisotropies were first detected by the cobe ",
    "dmr experiment ( smoot et al . 1992 ) .",
    "the angular scales observed by cobe were rather wide ( @xmath22 ) and allowed to inspect a part of the spectrum which is almost substance independent .",
    "nevertheless , cobe measurement provide the normalization of density fluctuations out of the horizon , and fair constraints on the primeval spectral index @xmath5 ( bennet et al .",
    "more recent baloon  borne and ground based experiments investigated cbr fluctuations on scales comparable with the horizon scale at recombination in the standard cdm model , on these scales , one expects the first doppler peak and , unlike what happens on larger scales , anisotropies are related both to the spectral index @xmath5 and to substance mix . in principle , these scale are the best ones to test mixed models , as on even smaller scales ( @xmath23 see below ) the cbr spectrum can be distorted by other effects , like reionization and lensing .",
    "the degree scale measurements currently available seem to have detected the doppler peak at a fair angular scale , but with an amplitude higher than expected in a standard cdm scenario with @xmath24 ( scott et al .",
    "1995 , de bernardis et al .",
    "an analysis of such outputs seems to exclude low values of the density parameter @xmath25 ( hancock et al . 1998 , bartlett et al . 1998 ) .",
    "here @xmath26 is the present average density in the universe and @xmath27 depends on the value of the hubble parameter @xmath28km@xmath29s@xmath30mpc@xmath30 furthermore , lineweaver ( 1997 ) and lineweaver @xmath19 barbosa ( 1998 ) outline that observed anisotropies are still too large to agree with cdm and @xmath31 unless @xmath32 .",
    "alternative causes for such greater fluctuations can be @xmath0 or a cosmic substance comprising a substantial non  cdm component .    a number of large scale structure ( lss ) observables are obtainable from the linear theory of fluctuation growing .",
    "a wide range of mixed models predict fair values for them .",
    "tests of non linear features were also performed through n ",
    "body simulations ( see e.g. ghigna et al . ( 1997 ) and referencies therein ) .",
    "although some technical aspects of mixed model simulations are still questionable , one can state that suitable dm mixtures allow to fit lss data from 1 to 100 mpc , almost up to scales covered by the current cbr experiments , so that a simultaneous analysis of cbr anisotropies and lss allow complementary tests of the models .",
    "it ought to be outlined that @xmath1 and a hot component have a partially compensating effect on lss and , in a previous paper ( bonometto @xmath19 pierpaoli 1998 , hereafter bp ; see also lucchin et al .",
    "1996 , liddle et al .",
    "1996 ) , we discussed how they could be combined to obtain a fit with lss data .",
    "on cbr fluctuations , instead , they add their effects and a quantitative analysis is needed to see how far one can go from both @xmath24 and pure cdm .",
    "most of this paper is focused on such analysis and on the tools needed to perform it .",
    "in particular , let us outline that public codes , like cmbfast , can not predict cbr anisotropies for mixed models with a hot component of non  thermal origin .",
    "a part of this work , therefore , required a suitable improvement of current algorithms .",
    "in this work only models with @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are considered .",
    "the _ cosmic substance _ is fixed by the partial density parameters : @xmath36 for baryons , @xmath37 for cold  dark  matter ( cdm ) , @xmath9 and @xmath3 ( see below ) for hdm .",

    "the relation between the nature of hdm and the amount of sterile massless components ( smlc hereafter ) needs also to be discussed ( in standard cdm , smlc is made by 3 massless @xmath13 s ) .",

    "space distributions of the hot particles and discussing how current algorithms need to be modified to provide cbr anisotropies for volatile models .",
    "we then perform an analysis of the parameter space : models are preselected according to lss constraints related to the linear theory .",
    "this selection is based on bp results , whose criteria will be briefly reviewed ( section 4 ) .",
    "bp results , however , were restricted to the case @xmath45 . here",

    "this limitation does not hold if @xmath88 is a massless scalar as is expected to exist in theories where a global invariance is broken below a suitable energy scale ( examples of such particles are _ familons _ and _ majorons _ ) .    using the distribution ( 2.6 ) , it is easy to see that the average @xmath95 and @xmath86 s will therefore become non relativistic when @xmath96 ; henceforth @xmath97 can be used in the distribution ( 2.6 ) , instead of eq .",
    "( 2.7 ) .",
    "if @xmath88 s are sterile scalars and the decay takes place after bbns , they will contribute to smlc and affect cbr and lss just as extra massless neutrino states .",

    "@xmath77 decay modifies it , turning @xmath15 into an effective value @xmath99 in particular , @xmath88 s lower the _ equivalence _ redshift . for @xmath100 ,",
    "also @xmath86 s are still relativistic at equivalence .",
    "accordingly , the equivalence occurs at either @xmath101 in the former and latter case , respectively .",
    "volatile models , as well as neutrino models , can be parametrized through the values of @xmath9 and @xmath102",
    ". however , at given @xmath9 , the latter ones are allowed only for discrete @xmath102 values ( notice that such @xmath102 values are independent of @xmath103 and can be only marginally shifted by changing @xmath104 ) .",
    "the former ones , instead , are allowed for a continuous set of @xmath102 values .",
    "this can be seen in fig .  1 , which is taken from bp , where more details on volatile models can be found .",
    "in fig .  1 we also show which models are consistent with lss constraints and cobe quadrupole data , for various @xmath0 .",
    "such constraints will be briefly discussed in the next section . in general , they are fulfilled for a part of the allowed @xmath105 values .",
    "1 also shows that there is a large deal of mixed models with low @xmath3 which are allowed by lss data and are not consistent with hdm made of massive @xmath13 s .",
    "in this article we shall show that a portion of this extra parameter space seems however forbidden by cbr constraints .",
    "to describe the evolution of radiation anisotropies in an expanding universe , it is convenient to write the metric in the form @xmath106 ~. \\eqno ( 3.1)\\ ] ] in the conformal newtonian gauge . here",
    "@xmath107 ( components of the vector @xmath108 ) are space coordinates , @xmath109 is the conformal time , @xmath110 is the scale factor and @xmath111 gives the spatial part of the metric tensor in the homogeneity limit .",
    "the deviation from a pure friedmann metric , due to gravitational field inhomogeneities , are given by the _ potentials _ @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "in the presence of inhomogeneities , the temperature of radiation @xmath114 $ ] contains an anisotropy term , which can be thought as a superposition of plain waves of wave ",
    "numbers @xmath115 . in respect to a given direction @xmath116 , the amplitude of the single @xmath115 mode can be expanded into spherical harmonics . for our statistical aims",
    "it is however sufficient to consider the anisotropy as a function of @xmath117 and use the expansion : @xmath118 where @xmath119 are legendre polynomials and whose coefficients can be used to work out the angular fluctuation spectrum @xmath120 which , for a gaussian random field , completely describes angular anisotropies .    at the present time @xmath121 and for a comoving scale given by the wavenumber @xmath122",
    ", we can compute @xmath123 performing a time integral ( seljak and zaldarriaga , 1996 ) @xmath124 \\eqno ( 3.4)\\ ] ] over the source function @xmath125 , which depends upon inhomogeneity evolution inside the last scattering band and from it to now .",
    "the physics of microwave background anisotropies due to adiabatic perturbations has been deeply investigated in the last few years .",
    "it has been shown that the characteristics of the peaks in the @xmath7 spectrum are related to the physics of acoustic oscillations of baryons and radiation between the entry of a scale in the horizon and the last scattering band , and on the history of photons from last scattering surface to us .",
    "background features , like the overall matter and radiation density content , @xmath103 and @xmath126 , have an influence both on the positions of the peaks and on their amplitude , but the latter also depends greatly on the baryon content @xmath127 and more slightly on the characteristic of the hot component .    in the following",
    "we shall analyze in detail the angular spectrum of volatile models , outlining its peculiarities with respect to standard cdm and neutrino models . in order to do so",
    ", we need to modify available public codes , like cmbfast , allowing them to deal with a hot component whose momentum distribution is ( 2.6 ) .",
    "it should also be recalled that volatile and neutrino models , for given @xmath9 and @xmath102 , are expected to include a different amount of smlc . in neutrino models",
    "smlc is less than in pure cdm and even vanishes if all @xmath13 s are massive ( unless extra smlc is added @xmath128 ) . in volatile models , instead , smlc is however more than in pure cdm , as scalar @xmath88 s are added on top of standard massless @xmath13 s .",
    "several @xmath7 spectra of volatile models are presented in figs .",
    "they show two main features , if compared with standard cdm : the first doppler peak is higher and the second and third doppler peaks are slightly shifted to the right .    in principle , we expect volatile model spectra to differ from neutrino model spectra because of the momentum distribution of volatiles and the extra smlc they have to include . in the following",
    ", we shall try to disentangle these two effects .    to this aim",
    "we coupled each volatile models with a @xmath129 neutrino case with identical @xmath9 and @xmath102 , but a greater number of neutrino degrees of freedom , so to ensure equal high - redshift energy densities . in fig",
    ".  2 we report the scale  factor dependence of the energy densities @xmath130 of volatiles and a massive neutrinos in two coupled models . in the case shown , the two energy densities never differ in ratio more than @xmath131 ; for different choice of the parameters the curve is just shifted to higher or lower redshifts according to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "more in detail fig .",
    "2 states that volatiles have a slower derelativization than neutrinos : the transition phase from the relativistic to the non  relativistic regime starts earlier and goes on for a longer time .",
    "this behaviour is related to the different shapes of the two distribution functions , and to the fact that the volatile one is smoother around @xmath132 , which corresponds to a value significantly smaller than its maximum , after which it is rapidly cutoff [ see eqs .",
    "( 2.6 ) , ( 2.7 ) ] .",
    "friedman equations show that @xmath133 is approximately constant .",
    "hence , once we know @xmath130 , we can perform a comparison between the conformal times of coupled volatile and @xmath129 neutrino cases .",
    "it shows a marginal discrepancy as already the @xmath134 in the volatile and @xmath129 neutrino cases are very similar , and moreover the hot component always contributes as a small fraction of the total energy density . on the contrary , if a similar comparison is performed between standard cdm and volatile models , big discrepancies are found , especially at high redshifts .",
    "in fact , in the volatile cases the relativistic background is greater due to the contribution of the sterile component , and the conformal time is therefore smaller than in the cdm case ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "this implies visible effects on the position of the doppler peaks , which are due to the oscillatory phase with which the photon  baryon fluid meets the last scattering band ( see hu & sugiyama 1995 ) .",
    "the photon ",
    "baryon fluid oscillates as @xmath135 , where @xmath122 is the comoving scale and @xmath136 is the sound horizon ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 is the sound speed ) . given the photon ",
    "baryon ratio , @xmath139 follow a similar trend as @xmath140 .",
    "since in volatile models @xmath140 is smaller than in cdm , so will be @xmath139 , and the peaks of the spectrum will appear in correspondence to higher @xmath122 ( i.e. higher @xmath141 ) values .",
    "this is a specific features of these models , in neutrino models the same effect plays a role , but shifting the peaks in the opposite direction ( dodelson et al .",
    "1996 ) .    for a given @xmath5 , the height of the peaks",
    "is fixed by ( i ) the ratio between baryon and photon densities , @xmath142 @xmath143 , and ( ii ) the ratio between matter and radiation densities . at fixed @xmath127 and @xmath103 the main reason for a higher doppler peak in volatile models ( with respect to cdm )",
    "is the delayed matter  radiation equivalence , for which both smlc and , possibly , volatiles can be responsible . in neutrino models without @xmath144@xmath145 smlc , only the possible delay due to late derelativizing @xmath13 s may exist .",
    "this is why volatile @xmath7 spectra and standard neutrino ones look so different .",
    "however , there is a tiny further contribution in the boost of the peak due to the free - streaming of the hot component .",
    "several authors ( ma & bertschinger 1995 , dodelson et al .",
    "1996 ) have shown that even in high @xmath3 neutrino models the doppler peaks are enhanced with respect to cdm , and in that case the free - streaming of the hot component is to be considered responsible for the enhancement . free  streaming , in fact , causes a decay in the potential @xmath113 which contributes as a forcing factor ( trough @xmath146 ) in the equations whose solution are the _ sonic _ oscillations in the photon  baryon fluid , displacing their zero  point and , henceforth , the phase by which they enter the last scattering band . in the standard neutrino case",
    ", this effect causes a variation of @xmath147 at most on the @xmath7 , and typically of @xmath148 on the first doppler peak .    in principle",
    "one can expect that the different momentum distribution of volatiles may alterate the free  streaming behaviour .",
    "such differences , if they exist , can be found by comparing volatile spectra with the @xmath129 neutrino ones .",
    "the differences between the two spectra are presented are shown in fig .  4 , and amount to @xmath149 at most .",
    "although modest , this is another feature that characterizes volatile models with respect to neutrino one .    in comparison with such finely tuned predictions from theoretical models ,",
    "currently available data are still affected by huge errorbars .",
    "however , some feature seems already evident from them . in fig .",
    "615 we perform a comparison of model predictions with data and show that the doppler peak observed by the saskatoon experiment ( netterfield et al .",
    "1997 ) exceeds the one expected in pure cdm once it is normalized to cobe data ( bennet et al . 1996 ) .",
    "while it is evident that volatile models show a higher doppler peak , it is clear that a fit could be reached also changing other parameters , @xmath20 , by taking @xmath1 . in fig .",
    "4 we show what happens in neutrino models if the spectrum is anti  tilted to @xmath150 and to @xmath151 . indeed , the first doppler peak is raised ( which is desirable ) , but also the following peaks are raised , making difficult the agreement with the results from the cat experiment ( scott et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in section 5 similar considerations will be used in order to constrain the whole set of volatile models .",
    "mixed model parameters can be constrained from particle physics and/or from lss . in this section",
    "we review a number of the latter constraints , which can be tested without discussing non  linear evolution . in appendix a we debate constraints on the spectral index @xmath5 arising from inflation .    even without considering their non  linear evolution",

    "only models for which the predicted value of @xmath199 exceeds 0.5 , at least for a part of the allowed @xmath187 interval , are therefore viable . in turn , also for viable models , this may yield a further restriction on the @xmath187 interval .",

    "furthermore the lower limit can be particularly sensitive to underestimates of non  linear effects .",

    "volatile models with @xmath223 are largely out of the errorbars , and should be considered as scarcely viable . nevertheless , even for @xmath151 , volatile models allow a higher first doppler peak without raising the following ones , and therefore fit the data better than neutrino models . just as large @xmath5 , also large @xmath102 causes conflict with data , by itself . for example , fig .  10 show that models with @xmath224 are disfavoured , even with low @xmath9 and @xmath150 .",

    "they outlined that , in order to lower @xmath205 at least down to 0.3 ( peacock & dodds 1994 ) , in a @xmath68 universe with @xmath24 , an equivalent number of massless neutrinos as high as 16 is needed .",
    "white et al . ( 1995 ) , who also consider @xmath109cdm models but with a lighter neutrino , also pointed out that the predicted @xmath205 of these models is lower due to the high @xmath226 , and show that a lower @xmath205 implies a higher first doppler peak .",
    "their work , however , is only qualitative , and they do nt infer any restriction in the parameter space using the data .",
    "lookng at the data , we found out that if @xmath150 , cbr data models with an equivalent number of neutrino species @xmath227 as in figs .",
    "10 ,  12 and 15 are disfavoured .",
    "models like the one shown in fig .  8 ( @xmath228 ) seem to better fit the data , although even lower @xmath211 ( @xmath229 ) , as provided by the model in fig .  9 , should not be disreguarded .",
    "keeping to @xmath24 , lss already exclude very high @xmath225 values , so that a low @xmath211 is automatically ensured .",
    "the models shown in figs .",
    "67 seem to well fit the data , with a corresponding @xmath230 .",
    "in this work we have analized mixed models from the point of view of both lss and cmb predictions .",
    "we considered different hot dark matter components : the standard neutrino case and the volatile case in which particles come from the decay of heavier ones .",
    "first we tested the mixed models on available lss data requiring fair predictions for @xmath160 , @xmath205 , dlas and @xmath186 .",
    "this analysis shows that it must be @xmath231 .",
    "this comes as no surprise , as mixed models with greater @xmath9 have not been considered since long .",
    "the new result is that taking @xmath5 up to 1.4 does not ease the problems previously found for large @xmath9 .    on the contrary , volatile models together with @xmath0",
    "significantly widen the parameter space in the low @xmath3 direction and viable models even with @xmath232 can be found .",
    "in fact , as far as @xmath6 is concerned , we found a nearly degenerate behaviour of the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath3 , as the damping on the high @xmath122 values due to low @xmath3 can be compensated by high @xmath5 .",
    "cbr data , apparently , break the degeneracy . in section  3",
    "we have shown that the cbr spectrum of volatile models is significantly different from standard cdm and also from neutrino models usually considered .",
    "in fact smlc and late @xmath3 volatiles cause a late @xmath70 and , henceforth , a higher first doppler peak .",
    "minor effects are caused by the typical momentum distribution of volatiles .",
    "these effects amounts to 2 % at most in the @xmath7 spectrum and only an accurate analysis of the results of future satellites , as map and planck , could allow to detect it .",
    "cbr spectra of volatile models were then compared with available data from different experiments , namely those from cobe , saskatoon and cat experiments .",
    "data on cbr spectrum at large @xmath141 imply that temperature fluctuations @xmath233 are appreciated .",
    "therefore , measures of the cbr spectrum , for high @xmath141 values , still need to be treated with some reserve .",
    "it seems however clear that recent observations tend to indicate a doppler peak higher than expected both for pure cdm and for mixed models with early derelativization , such as most neutrino models .",
    "taking @xmath1 and/or late derelativization raises the doppler peak and affects the cbr spectrum at high @xmath141 .",
    "the first question we tried to answer is how far we can and have to go from pure cdm and @xmath24 to meet current large @xmath141 data .",
    "we found that volatile models could cure this discrepancy , while ensuring a viable scenario for structure formation .    in turn ,",
    "large @xmath141 data imply restrictions in the parameter space , complementary to the ones derived from lss while a fit of such data requires only a slight departure from pure cdm and @xmath24 .",
    "allows us to say that mixed models are in very good shape .",
    "for example , fig.s 8 - 9 show the @xmath7 behaviour for @xmath150 and hdm ranging from 11@xmath174 to 16 % .",
    "such models provide excellent fits to current data and , as explained in bp , are also in agreement with lss .",
    "other models , for larger @xmath5 and @xmath9 or lower @xmath3 , show only a marginal fit with current observations .",
    "hopefully , future data on high @xmath141 s will be more restrictive and allow safer constraints . at present ,",
    "such models can not be ruled out , although they are more discrepant from pure cdm and @xmath24 than high @xmath141 data require . in our opinion , however , cbr data can already be said to exclude a number of models which fitted lss data . in general , models with @xmath234 and @xmath235 seem out of the range of reasonable expectations .    altogether , three kinds of departures from cdm and zeldovich were considered in this work : large @xmath9 , low @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "large ( but allowed ) @xmath9 values , by themselves , do not ease the agreement of models with high @xmath141 data .",
    "taking @xmath1 eases the agreement of models with data for @xmath236 , as is expected , but seems to rise the angular spectrum above data for greater @xmath141 s .",
    "taking low @xmath3 , instead , raises the doppler peak , but does not spoil the agreement with greater @xmath141 data .",
    "current data , therefore , seems to support models with a limited amount of hdm or volatile materials , possibly in association with @xmath5 slightly above unity , to compensate some effects on lss .",
    "note that the analysis of this work is carried out keeping @xmath68 , allowing for no cosmological constant , and constraining the total density to be critical .",
    "e.g. , raising @xmath103 would probably allow and require a stronger deviation from pure cdm and @xmath24 .",
    "we plan to widen our analysis of the parameter space in the near future , also in connection with the expected arrival of fresh observational data on the cbr spectrum .",

    "this section is a quick review of results in the literature , aiming to show that there is a wide class of inflationary models which predict @xmath0 , but @xmath237 .    during inflation , quantum fluctuations of the _ inflaton _ field @xmath238 on the event horizon",
    "give rise to density fluctuations .",
    "their amplitude and power spectrum are related to the hubble parameter @xmath239 during inflation and to the speed @xmath240 of the _ slow  rolling  down _ process .",
    "the critical quantity is the ratio @xmath241 , where @xmath239 and @xmath240 are taken when the scale @xmath242 is the event horizon .",
    "it can be shown that @xmath243 and , if @xmath244 ( slowly ) decreases with time , we have the standard case of @xmath5 ( slightly ) below unity . such decrease occurs if the downhill motion of @xmath238 is accelerated and an opposite behaviour occurs if @xmath240 decreases while approaching a minimum . the basic reason why a potential yielding such a behaviour seems unappealing , is that the very last stages of inflation should rather see a significant @xmath238field acceleration , ending up into a regime of damped oscillations around the true vacuum , when reheating occurs .",
    "however , the usual perspective can be reversed if the reheating does not arise when an initially smooth acceleration finally grows faster and faster , but is triggered by an abrupt first order phase transition , perhaps due to the break of the gut symmetry . before it and since the planck time , most energy resided in potential terms , so granting a vacuum  dominated expansion .",
    "this picture of the early cosmic expansion is the so  called _",
    "hybrid inflation _ , initially proposed by linde ( 1991a ) .    a toy  model to realize such scenario ( linde 1991b , 1994 ) is obtainable from the potential @xmath245 which depends on the scalar fields @xmath238 and @xmath246 , that we shall see to evolve slowly and fastly , respectively .",
    "if the _ slow _ field is embedded in mass terms , the potential reads @xmath247 where @xmath248 eq .",
    "( a.3 ) shows that @xmath249 has a minimum at @xmath250 , provided that @xmath251 . if @xmath252 , instead , the minimum is for @xmath253@xmath254 , yielding @xmath255 when @xmath256 .",
    "large @xmath238 values therefore require that @xmath246 vanishes and then the potential @xmath257 gives a planck ",
    "time inflation , as @xmath249 goes from an initial value @xmath258 to a value @xmath259 .",
    "the downhill motion of @xmath238 will decelerate as soon as the second term at the @xmath260 of eq .",
    "( a.5 ) becomes negligible , in respect to @xmath261 , which acts as a cosmological constant .",
    "this regime breaks down when the critical value @xmath262 is attained",
    ". then @xmath263 changes sign and the configuration @xmath264 becomes unstable .",
    "we have then a transition to the true vacuum configuration @xmath253 , which reheats ( or heats ) the universe .",
    "there are several constraints to the above picture , in order that at least 60 e  foldings occur with @xmath265 and fluctuations have a fair amplitude .",
    "they are discussed in several papers ( see , @xmath20 , copeland et al . 1994 , and references therein ) and cause the restriction @xmath266 .",
    "it is fair to outline that _ hybrid _ inflation is not just one of the many possible variations on the inflationary theme . in spite of the apparent complication of the above scheme , it is an intrinsically simple picture and one of the few patterns which can allow to recover a joint particle ",
