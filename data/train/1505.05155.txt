    "spectroscopic observations of thermonuclear bursts from accreting neutron stars with the last generation of x - ray telescopes have provided measurements of both the radii and the masses of several sources with weakly correlated uncertainties ( e.g. , zel et al .",
    "2009 , 2012 ; gver et al .",
    "2010a , b ; gver & zel 2013 ) . observations of similar neutron stars during quiescence have yielded measurements of their apparent angular sizes , which leads to a determination of the radii with correlated uncertainties with the neutron star mass ( heinke et al .",

    "2011 , 2013 ) .",
    "a parallel avenue of progress has taken place in understanding the mapping from neutron star masses and radii to the equation of state .",
    "several parametric representations of the equation of state allow radius measurements to be used for a direct inference of the pressure at several fiducial densities above the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath4 ; lindblom 1992 ; lattimer & prakash 2001 ; zel & psaltis 2009 ; read et al .",
    "zel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) used one of these mapping techniques on the radius measurements obtained from thermonuclear bursters to place the first constraints on the neutron star equation of state at high densities .",
    "they found that the relatively small observed radii point to lower pressures at and above @xmath5 than those predicted by purely nucleonic equations of state .",
    "similarly small radii were found by guillot et al .",
    "( 2013 ) in their analysis of quiescent neutron stars , which also point to softer equations of state than expected for nucleonic compositions .",
    "steiner et al .  ( 2010 ) and lattimer & steiner ( 2014a ) found that substantial reinterpretation of the observed astrophysical phenomena and/or choosing extreme values for some of the measurements was needed to make the observed radii larger and reduce the tension with the predictions of some nucleonic equations of state .",
    "since these first studies , our understanding of systematics in the spectroscopic measurements has been substantially improved and theoretical work has identified a number of small , albeit important , corrections that need to be applied to the inference of neutron star radii . in this paper , we incorporate these corrections and sources of uncertainty in the analysis of the spectroscopic data and infer the parameters of the neutron star matter equation of state that are consistent with all astrophysical data as well as with laboratory experiments at low densities .    specifically , comprehensive studies of a large sample of sources allowed for a quantitative assessment of the systematic uncertainties in the spectroscopic measurements . for thermonuclear bursters ,",
    "a bayesian mixture technique with an outlier detection scheme was applied on a very large rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) sample consisting of 13,095 burst spectra from 12 sources .",
    "this resulted in a data - driven measurement of the intrinsic scatter in the apparent angular sizes during the cooling tails of bursts ( gver et al .",
    "2012b ) and of the scatter in the touchdown fluxes during photosperic radius - expansion bursts in individual sources ( gver et al .",
    "moreover , a comparison of the simultaneous observations of bursts with multiple x - ray instruments , and specifically between the pca and _ chandra _ acis ) significantly constrained any biases in the rxte burst fluxes due to calibration to @xmath6 ( gver et al .",
    "2015 ) . for quiescent neutron stars , long observations with _",
    "chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ resulted in high signal - to - noise spectra , which , in combination with explorations of uncertainties in the atmospheric composition and the amount of interstellar extinction in the soft x - rays , improved the inferences of their apparent angular sizes ( guillot et al .",
    "2013 ; guillot & rutledge 2014 ; heinke et al .",
    "2014 ) .",
    "numerous developments have also taken place on the theoretical models that are employed to interpret these observational data .",
    "since most of the x - ray burst sources spin at moderately high rates , general relativistic corrections to the apparent angular sizes that go beyond the schwarzschild approximation and incorporate effects that are of second order in spin have been calculated ( baubck et al .",
    "2012 , 2015 ) .",
    "radiative equilibrium models of neutron star atmospheres have also been improved by including the angle and energy dependence of the scattering kernels ( suleimanov et al .",
    "2011 , 2012 ) .",
    "these resulted in more accurate relations between spectral and effective temperatures as well as in notable temperature corrections to the eddington ( touchdown ) fluxes .",
    "different statistical tools for inferring the uncertainties in the neutron star radii and masses from burst data have been assessed .",
    "this led to the identification of a bayesian method that does not introduce biases in the radius measurements , in contrast to the frequentist method used in earlier studies ( see the companion paper zel & psaltis 2015 ) .",
    "finally , bayesian methods have also been developed to infer the properties of the dense matter equation of state from radius and mass measurements ( steiner et al .",

    "as discussed in baubck et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , the rotational effects lead to larger angular sizes for the same neutron star mass and radius .      the atmospheres of neutron stars during thermonuclear bursts are dominated by electron scattering . during strong bursts ,",
    "the radiation forces lift the photosphere above the neutron star surface and allow for a measurement of the eddington critical luminosity .",

    "we also plot in red the corresponding contour obtained when the temperature correction to the eddington flux is not taken into account , as was done in the previous studies . because at high temperature the scaterring cross section decreases , a measured eddington flux corresponds to a smaller mass ( and radius ) .",
    "it is clear from equations  [ eq : arot ] and [ eq : tcorr ] that measurements of the apparent angular size and the eddington flux of a neutron star can be combined to determine its mass when the distance to the source is known . in earlier studies ,",
    "this inference was performed and the uncertainties were assessed in a frequentist approach .",
    "we showed in a companion paper that this approach suffers from significant biases for the range of masses and radii expected for neutron stars ( see zel & psaltis 2015 ) .",
    "to alleviate these shortcomings , we devised a bayesian framework that more faithfully reconstructs masses and radii from synthetic data and we utilize it in the present analysis .",
    "using bayes theorem , we write the likelihood @xmath37 that a neutron star has a given mass and radius given a set of spectroscopic observables as @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the priors over the mass and radius and @xmath41 is an appropriate normalization constant .",

    "when we use this expression , we assume flat priors over the mass between 0.6 and 3.5  @xmath51 and over the radius between the schwarzschild radius that corresponds to each mass and 20  km .",
    "these ranges are chosen to be large enough such that their precise values do not affect the posterior likelihoods .    when the spin frequency of a source is previously measured , we take as @xmath50 a delta function at the known frequency . when the spin frequency is not known , we assume a flat prior between 250 and 650  hz , which is consistent with the range of spins observed in thermonuclear bursters , and apply spin corrections to the apparent angular size with this prior .",

    "they followed this approach because they argued that the two spectroscopic measurements from each source are otherwise inconsistent with each other . in zel & psaltis ( 2015 )",

    "will appear to be inconsistent with each other and will not lead to a solution for the neutron star mass and radius .",
    "as the lower left panels of figures  3 - 8 show , taking these effects into account makes the two spectroscopic observables in all sources consistent with each other at the 68% level even when only the most likely value of the distance and the central value of the color correction factor are considered .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ fig:1820_post ] , which compares the prior and posterior likelihoods of the blackbody normalization , the touchdown flux , and the distance for 4u  1820@xmath5230 ; this is the source for which steiner et al .",

    "( 2010 ) that the photosphere at what we identified as the touchdown point is much larger than the neutron star radius .",
    "this was problematic for two reasons .",
    "first , in order for the blackbody normalization to remain small at that point while the photospheric radius is still extremely large , the color correction factor needs to be unphysically large ; i.e , larger by factors of three or more than what the atmosphere models predict . second , within 1 - 2 time bins , as the photosphere settles onto the neutron star , the color correction factor would need to evolve in such a way that it exactly cancels out the change in the photospheric radius , keeping a constant blackbody normalization .",

    "et al .  ( 2015 ) , we showed that this criterion is not useful for burst selection from rxte data for three reasons .",

    "this is exactly the range of fluxes near the eddington limit that one needs to resolve in order to see the expected evolution of the color correction factor .",
    "second , the scatter in the blackbody normalization due to even a mild change in the emitting area ( due to , e.g. , uneven burning or an evolving photosphere ) masks the theoretical trends . finally , the correlated measurement uncertainties between the blackbody normalization and temperature further smear any trends . by not taking these data limitations into account , poutanen et al .",

    "( 2014 ) studies , applying these theoretically motivated criteria led to selection of bursts that are inconsistent with the framework of the method : in the former by selecting spectra that are clearly not described by their atmopsheric models and , in the latter , by comparing models of the color correction factor evolution near the eddington limit to bursts that have not reached it .",
    "kajava et al .",

    "we now make use of the one - to - one mapping between the neutron star mass - radius relation and the pressure - density relation of cold dense matter to put direct constraints on the neutron - star equation of state . in this procedure",
    ", we take the most general approach and do not assume that neutron stars have a constant radius or make assumptions about their masses based on the observationally determined mass distribution .    the structure equations for relativistic stars",
    "provide , for each equation of state , a unique mass - radius curve , with no adjustable parameters .",
    "because of this , a large number of radius measurements across a range of neutron star masses allow us to invert the measurements formally and obtain the unique equation of state that gave rise to the measured mass - radius pairs ( lindblom 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , more recent parametric forms of the equation of state that do not rely on particular nuclear physics models ( e.g. , read et al .  2009 ; zel & psaltis 2009 ; steiner et al .  2010 ; lattimer & steiner 2014b ) allow us to put this inversion into practice even without sampling the entire mass - radius curve .",
    "this is because the radii of astrophysically relevant neutron stars turn out to be sensitive to the equation of state in a fairly narrow range of densities between 1.8 and 7.4 times the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath4 ) and this , in turn , enables a discretization of the equation of state over this narrow range of densities using only three sampling points that are connected by piecewise polytropes ( read et al .  2009 ; zel & psaltis 2009 ) . using the sly equation of state ( douchin & haensel 2001 ) up to a density of @xmath112  g  @xmath113 and taking the fiducial densities at 1.85  @xmath4 , 3.7  @xmath4 , and 7.4  @xmath4 , which we denote as @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 , respectively",
    ", these studies have shown that the discretized equations of state generate mass - radius relations that faithfully reproduce the mass - radius relations of the continuous @xmath117 ) functions for a large number of proposed equations of state .",
    "of these three pressures , the pressure at 1.85  @xmath4 sets the overall radii of neutron stars , the pressure at 3.7  @xmath4 determines the slope of the predicted @xmath118 relation , and the pressure at 7.4  @xmath4 sets the maximum mass .    in zel",
    "et al .  ( 2010 ) , we used the framework devised in zel & psaltis ( 2009 ) to convert the mass - radius measurements of three sources to posterior likelihoods over the pressures at these three fiducial densities . in order to incorporate the mass - radius measurements of the twelve sources presented in section  3",
    ", we will follow here the bayesian approach outlined below .",
    "( see steiner et al .",

    "as expected from the above discussion , the preferred mass - radius relation lies to the left of most model predictions and is closest to ap4 , especially at low masses , where the main uncertainty in ap4 is in the strength of the three - nucleon interactions .",

    ", flat prior on @xmath165 or @xmath166 ) , the predicted radius for a @xmath167 neutron star is between 10.1 and 11.1  km .    because of the relatively narrow range of the statistically acceptable values of the three pressures , the effect of changing the prior distributions is only marginal .",
    "it leads to a small shift in the most likely values of the pressures and a change in the predicted radii that is @xmath168  km .",
    "this is similar in magnitude to the result obtained by steiner et al .",

    "third , we incorporate the fact that , since that study , two @xmath171 neutron stars have been discovered .",
    "this effectively places a lower limit on the slope of the mass - radius relation , controlled by @xmath151 , and its turnover point , controlled by @xmath138 ( see zel & psaltis 2009 ; lattimer & prakash 2010 ) .",
    "guillot et al .  (",
    "2013 ) used the qlmxbs and a constant radius model to infer typical neutron star radii of @xmath172  km , which also indicate low values of @xmath140 .",

    "we also incorporate the radius measurements from thermonuclear bursts as well as the mass limits from the heaviest known neutron stars .",
    "our results point to smaller neutron star radii by @xmath173  km and to lower pressures than the analyses of steiner et al .",
    "( 2010 , 2013 ) and lattimer & steiner ( 2014a ) .",
    "as explained in section 3.1.7 , in their analysis of the burst data , these authors obtained larger radii because of their assumption regarding the location of the photosphere at touchdown . in their analysis of the data from several qlmxbs ,",
    "lattimer & steiner ( 2014a ) also obtained larger radii by using a range of estimated values of @xmath71 to alter the @xmath118 contours from guillot et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , instead of reanalyzing these data . because of the strong correlation between @xmath71 and the apparent radius at infinity , this method underestimates the width of @xmath118 contours reported in that study .",
    "finally , they assumed different distances to some of the globular clusters as well as helium atmospheres for any qlmxb other than @xmath76cen , all of which push the inferred radii to larger values .",
    "we performed a comprehensive study of spectroscopic radius measurements of neutron stars using thermonuclear bursters and quiescent low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "we included a number of corrections to the mass - radius inference that have recently been calculated , incorporated systematic uncertainties in the measurements , and employed bayesian statistical tools to map the observed quantities to neutron star masses and radii and the latter to the neutron star equation of state .",
    "using a total of twelve sources allows us to place strong and quantitative constraints on the properties of the equation of state between @xmath1 times the nuclear saturation density , even though the individual measurements themselves do not have the precision to lead to tight constraints .",
    "we find that around @xmath2 , the preferred equation of state predicts a radius of @xmath174  km .",
    "when interpreting the constraints on the pressure at 1.85  @xmath4 in the context of an expansion in terms of few - body potentials ( see , e.g. , akmal et al .  1998 ; pieper et al .  2001 ; hebeler et al .  2010 ; gandolfi et al .",
    "2012 ) , our results suggest a relatively weak contribution of the three - body interaction potential . in the framework of quark matter equations of state ,",
    "the inferred lower pressure at @xmath175 is consistent with an increased effective pairing interaction in the interpolated equation of state ( the njl parameter h ) at densities @xmath176 . while one can see this effect in model dependent calculations ( kojo et al .",
    "2015 ) , such a lower pressure is physically reasonable , independent of any particular model , since quark matter at lower densities , en route with decreasing density to the strong three quark correlations that eventually become well defined nucleons , is expected to have greater pairing correlations than at higher density .",
    "accounting for all sources of the inferred pressure decrease remains a theoretical challenge .",
    "even though we have taken into account , in the present work , a large number of systematic effects in both the observations and in the theoretical framework , our conclusion still relies on the validity of the astrophysical interpretation of two phenomena , namely , eddington - limited thermonuclear bursts and the emission from neutron stars in quiescence .",
    "we rely on the assumptions that the entire neutron star surface is visible during the cooling tails of bursts and during quiescence , that the eddington limit is reached in photospheric radius expansion bursts , and that the surface compositions in quiescence is dominated by hydrogen due to gravitational settling , unless there is evidence to the contrary .",
    "the fact that the two sets of measurements are in agreement with each other strongly argues against an overall systematic bias .",
    "nevertheless , radius measurements obtained by non - spectroscopic techniques with potential biases that are different than spectroscopic ones will be necessary to confirm the results of our study .",
