    "blue stragglers ( bss ) , first discovered by sandage in the globular cluster m3 , are stars lying above and blue - ward of the turn - off point in a cluster color - magnitude diagram . in recent years the high angular resolution and the uv imaging capabilities of the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( hst ) have made possible the search of bss even in the cores of highly concentrated globular clusters ( gcs ) .",
    "observations indicate that bss in gcs are preferentially found in the core ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999a ) ; but in at least two gcs , m3 ( ferraro et al .",
    "1993 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ) and m55 ( zaggia et al . 1997 ) bss are seen also in the external region of the gc .",
    "ferraro et al . (",
    "2003b ) have recently found that the radial distribution of bss in 47  tuc also appears bimodal , i.e. highly peaked in the core , decreasing at intermediate radii and rising again at larger radii .",
    "a long standing problem is the formation mechanism of bss .",
    "many scenarios have been proposed to explain the bs origin ( fusi pecci et al . 1992 ; bailyn 1995 ; bailyn and pinsonneault 1995 ; procter sills , bailyn & demarque 1995 ; sills & bailyn 1999 ; sills et al .",
    "2000 ; hurley et al . 2001 ) and two seem to be the most likely ones .",
    "the first , i.e. , the _ collisional scenario _ , indicates that bss are the end - product of a prompt merger between two main sequence stars in a direct collision that involves a ( resonant ) three or four body encounter ( davies , benz & hills 1994 ; lombardi et al .",
    "2002 ) ; these bss acquire kicks generated by dynamical recoil . the second , or _ mass - transfer scenario _ , suggests that bss are generated in primordial binaries ( hereafter pb ) that evolve mainly in isolation or harden gently by long - distance gravitational encounters until they reach contact , leading to ( unstable ) mass - transfer and final coalescence ( carney et al .",
    "2001 ) . in both these mechanisms bss are formed with a mass exceeding the turn - off mass of the cluster and can stay on the main sequence through the mixing of the hydrogen - rich surface layers of its two progenitor stars .",
    "these two scenarios do not necessarily exclude each other and may coexist ( leonard 1989 ; fusi pecci et al .",
    "1992 ; bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ; ferraro et al .",
    "1997 ; sills & bailyn 1999 ; hurley et al . 2001 ) .",
    "indeed , bimodal bs radial distributions seem to invite the invocation of two mechanisms : the bss in the core are principally created by star collisions , while external bss are formed from mass - transfer in pbs .",
    "still sigurdsson , davies & bolte ( 1994 ) suggested that the bimodal population in m3 might be entirely explained within a collisional model where external bss are formed in the core and ejected into the outer regions by recoil .",
    "however , further studies of the bs luminosity function and their comparison with theoretical models ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ; sills & bailyn 1999 ; sills et al . 2000 ; ferraro et al . 2003b ) , highlight the difficulty , if not the impossibility , to obtain a good fit of the observations assuming that all the bss are formed dynamically in the core . in this paper",
    "we study , in the light of the most recent data ( ferraro et al .",
    "2003b ) , the case of 47  tuc , comparing the observed bimodal distribution of bss with a series of simulations carried on using a new version of the dynamical code described in sigurdsson & phinney  ( 1995 ) .",
    "the code simulates a fixed cluster background with a multi - mass king density profile ( we choose 10 classes of mass , see table 1 and section 2 of sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) obtained imposing a stellar velocity dispersion ( for a mono - mass cluster ) @xmath0 and a central density @xmath1 ( pryor & meylan 1993 )",
    ". the observed profile has been obtained using the data - set published by ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003b ) and the procedure described in ferraro et al .",
    "( 2003c ) .",
    "additional hst archive data in the @xmath2 band have been used to combine the hst and the ground based dataset .",
    "all the stars brighter than the cluster main sequence turn - off ( @xmath3 ) have been used to compute the projected density profile .",
    "1 shows the comparison between observed and modeled projected density profile .",
    "this model has a concentration @xmath4 , and a core radius @xmath5 .",
    "a typical uncertainty of @xmath6 can be assumed in the @xmath7 determination .",
    "note that the value assumed for 47 tuc is consistent with that ( @xmath8 ) obtained by howell , guhathakurta & gilliland ( 2000 ) .",
    "assuming a distance of 4.6 kpc ( ferraro et al .",
    "1999b ) , the core is @xmath9 pc .",
    "the dimensionless central potential is @xmath10 ( @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the mean core dispersion velocity , @xmath13 , with @xmath14 the gravitational potential and @xmath15 the tidal radius ( sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) .",
    "0.2truecm = 9.truecm = 9.truecm [ fig1 ]    0.2truecm    on this background we evolve the dynamics of bss .",
    "we assume that collisional bss are generated exclusively in the innermost region , at radii less than @xmath16 , with @xmath17 and @xmath18 where the density is high to guarantee a high collision rate ( pooley et al .",
    "internal bss generated in pbs have been explored as last case and may be considered as extreme since dynamical interactions in dense cluster cores tend to destroy binaries and to alter those that remain through exchanges ( sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; ivanova et al .",
    "external bss formed in pbs are generated outside the core with initial positions distributed in several radial intervals , between 15 and 80 @xmath7 .",
    "all initial positions are randomly generated following a flat probability distribution ( see table 1 ) according to the fact that the number of stars in a king model scales as @xmath19 .",
    "this is the key difference between our simulations and those of sigurdsson et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , who generated bss only in the central region ( below 0.8 @xmath7 ) .",
    "bs velocities are randomly generated following the distribution illustrated in section 3 of sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ( eq .",
    "in addition , we assign a natal kick to those bss formed collisionally in the core : kick velocities fall in between 1 and 6 @xmath20 , and their distribution is flat or single valued .",
    "the masses of bss are generated between 1.2 and 2 @xmath21 , following indications from ferraro et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and gilliland et al .",
    "every single bs is evolved for a time @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a random number uniformly generated in [ 0,1 ] and @xmath24 is the lifetime assumed for a bs ( we have performed sets of runs with various @xmath24 , between 1 and 5 gyr ) .",
    "once generated , the bs drifts in the cluster background under the action of the cluster potential , dynamical friction and distant encounters ( eq . [ 3.4 ] of sigurdsson and phinney 1995 ) .",
    "near encounters are uninfluent .",
    "we performed more than 70,000 runs testing various scenarios .",
    "we first traced the bs evolution in the collisional hypothesis ( sigurdsson et al .",
    "we generated bss at radii less than 0.8 @xmath7 with recoil velocities in various ranges .",
    "we observed that for recoil velocities greater than 3.5 @xmath20 bss are expelled from the cluster , while for recoil velocities lower than 3 @xmath20 dynamical friction drags all of the bss into the core in @xmath25 years .",
    "the final simulated distribution , shown in fig .",
    "2a , is peaked in the center , but does not reproduce the observed rise in the outer region of the gc .",
    "thus , no collisional bss ejected from the core by recoil contribute to the external population .",
    "the best representation of the data is obtained generating 25% of the bss from mass - transfer in pbs between 30 and 60 @xmath7 with no kick , and 75% from collisions inside 0.5 @xmath7 with a natal kick of 1 @xmath20 ( see fig .",
    "0.2truecm = 8.truecm = 8.truecm [ fig2 ]    0.2truecm    another key parameter to understand bs evolution is their lifetime .",
    "we performed simulations with various lifetimes @xmath26 ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 gyr ) .",
    "we integrated the evolution of every single bs for a time homogeneously distributed between 0 and @xmath26 , assuming that bss are uniformly generated over the cluster lifetime , without peaks of formation .",
    "in absence of different indications this seems to be a reasonable assumption ( sigurdsson et al .",
    "we obtained the best representation for @xmath27 gyr . for @xmath28 gyr the number of bss out of 60 @xmath7 is at least twice the observed value . for @xmath29 gyr ,",
    "dynamical friction reduces the amplitude of the external rise in bss and tends to create a secondary `` hump '' of bss , which drifts toward the core ( fig .",
    "3 ) . at 5 gyr this hump peaks at 15 @xmath7 , just inside the observed depletion region .",
    "we performed also a set of runs where we impose that bss are all generated solely in pbs , between 0 and 60 @xmath7 ( imposing that 48% of bss are generated below 1 @xmath7 and 52% above 1 @xmath7 ) with no kick .",
    "fixing @xmath30=1 gyr , we found a bs distribution close to the observed but with a weaker rise above 30 @xmath7 .",
    "0.2truecm = 8.truecm = 8.truecm [ fig3 ]    0.2truecm",
    "our simulations show that all the external bss are formed by pbs beyond 30 @xmath7 in order to reproduce the spatial distribution with its zone of avoidance .",
    "thus we may ask if the external regions of 47  tuc host a number of binaries sufficient to produce all the observed peripheral bss and if these massive binaries survive in these regions for @xmath31 gyr ( approximately the lifetime of the cluster ) without drifting toward the center under the action of dynamical friction .",
    "unfortunately , there is no direct observational guidance to answer this question .",
    "the only study of binaries in 47  tuc is that of albrow et al .",
    "( 2001 ) who searched for binaries only in the central regions of 47  tuc .",
    "they found a binary frequency of @xmath32 in the core of the cluster .",
    "however , the binary fraction in the core , where binaries are created or destroyed , or modified in their properties by exchange interactions , does not provide a direct measure of the number of all truly pbs over the whole cluster .",
    "recent studies by ivanova et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indicate that the bulk of pbs remain in the outskirts of the gc .",
    "searches of pbs ( rubenstein & bailyn 1997 for ngc  6752 , and bellazzini et al .",
    "2002 for ngc  288 ) are still limited to cluster cores .",
    "some indication may come from our simulated cluster model that can provide us the mass of the cluster out of a certain radius .",
    "we found that the mass beyond 30 @xmath7 is @xmath33 .",
    "we can only guess what fraction of that mass is in binaries , but an assumption that 10% of the mass was originally in binaries is not unreasonable .",
    "this gives @xmath34 in binaries or at least 3@xmath35 binaries beyond 30 @xmath7 .",
    "hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) estimate a probability of 5@xmath36 for a binary to generate a bs at 12 gyr ( see model f ) .",
    "this implies that our estimated 3@xmath35 pbs beyond 30 @xmath7 can produce 15 - 30 bss - close enough to the 25 required outside 20 @xmath7 ( ferraro et al .",
    "recently , ivanova et al . ( 2004 ) indicate that a sizable number of binaries survive in the halo ( @xmath37 ) and only a few percent ( 5% ) in the core of a simulated 47  tuc like gc , assuming an initial binary fraction of 100@xmath38 if these figures apply , about 100 - 200 bss should reside in the halo of 47  tuc which are not seen ; this could be reconciled only if most of them are faint such to be confused with normal stars .",
    "however , observational studies indicate that the binary fraction tends to be lower in the halo than in the core ( see for example rubenstein & bailyn 1997 ) .",
    "two questions now remain : what mechanisms produce the zone of avoidance  ? can pbs survive in the external regions for a time comparable to the age of the cluster without drifting toward the core by dynamical friction ?",
    "we have calculated the distance from the gc center out of which the dynamical friction timescale @xmath39 is longer than the typical age of a pb of 47  tuc ( @xmath40 gyr ) . for a bs moving on a circular orbit ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath20 the line of sight mean stellar dispersion velocity ( @xmath43 ) , @xmath44 the mass of a typical bs ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath46 the local mass density at distance @xmath47 from the gc center .",
    "we found that the density at which @xmath48 gyr is @xmath49 .",
    "this corresponds to a distance of @xmath50 , as inferred from our king model , which is near the position of the zone of avoidance . in the case of eccentric orbits @xmath39",
    "can be significantly shorter ( colpi , mayer , & governato 1999 ) and this opens the possibility that pbs accrete to the core from outer distances . by running simulations that trace the orbital evolution of pbs in the gc potential with semi - major axis @xmath51 , eccentricity @xmath52 and total mass 1.2@xmath53 , we found that in most of our runs pbs born at @xmath54 with eccentricity @xmath55 have still a semimajor axis @xmath56 after 12 gyr .",
    "this suggests that the existence of a gap in the spatial distribution of the bss comes from the interplay between the dynamical friction timescale ( with its spread related to a spread in the orbital parameters ) and the characteristic lifetime of the bs .",
    "the comparison of the observed bs distribution in 47  tuc with the simulated distributions supports the hypothesis that internal bss principally result from stellar collisions , while external bss ( outside of 20 @xmath7 ) are exclusively generated by mass - transfer in pbs .",
    "the best fit to the observational data of 47  tuc is obtained when a sizable fraction ( 25% ) of bss is generated from pbs in peripheral regions ( [ 30,60 ] @xmath7 ) .",
    "the internal bss contributing up to 75% of the observed are all born inside 0.5 @xmath7 with a natal kick of 1 @xmath20 , and do not pollute the external regions .",
    "external bss contribute little to the core population .",
    "a scenario in which all bss are generated over the entire cluster by mass - transfer in pbs can not be ruled out .",
    "we believe however that a blending between collision induced evolution and internal evolution is at play in the gc core to explain internal bss .",
    "our main finding is the need of a population of external pbs in order to generate the bimodal distribution of the bss observed in 47  tuc .",
    "the required fraction ( 10% ) to fit the data does not seem unreasonable .",
    "more accurate counts of bss in gcs with widely different properties are about to be collected from high resolution photometry ( ferraro et al . 2004 in preparation ) .",
    "these observations may shed light into the nature of bss and the importance of pbs in gc evolution . in light of these upcoming observations , in paper ii ( mapelli et al . in preparation ) , we plan to continue our analysis with our simulations over a wide sample of gcs .",
    "theoretical studies using n - body ( baumgardt & makino 2003 ) or monte carlo techniques ( ivanova et al .",
    "2004 ) will eventually become necessary tool for exploring the formation and evolution of bss in gcs .",
