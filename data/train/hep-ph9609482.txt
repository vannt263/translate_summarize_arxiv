    "despite the unquestionable significance of its achievements , like that of predicting the existence of the top quark @xcite , there is no reason to believe that the standard model ( sm ) is the final theory .",
    "for instance , the sm contains many arbitrary parameters with no apparent connections .",
    "in addition , the sm provides no satisfactory explanation for the symmetry - breaking mechanism which takes place and gives rise to the observed mass spectrum of the gauge bosons and fermions . because the top quark is heavy relative to other observed fundamental particles , gev by the cdf group and @xmath1gev by the  0 group , through the detection of @xmath2 events .",
    "] one expects that any underlying theory ; to supersede the sm at some high energy scale @xmath3 , will easily reveal itself at lower energies through the effective interactions of the top quark to other light particles .",
    "also because the top quark mass ( @xmath4 ) is of the order of the fermi scale @xmath5gev , which characterizes the electroweak symmetry - breaking scale , the top quark system could be a useful probe for the symmetry - breaking sector . since the fermion mass generation can be closely related to the electroweak symmetry - breaking , one expects some residual effects of this breaking to appear in accordance with the mass hierarchy @xcite .",
    "this means that new effects should be more apparent in the top quark sector than in any other light sector of the theory .",
    "therefore , it is important to study the top quark system as a direct tool to probe new physics effects @xcite",
    ".    many attempts to offer alternative scenarios for the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism are discussed in literature .",
    "a general trend among all alternatives is that new physics appear at or below the tev scale .",
    "examples include supersymmetry models @xcite , technicolor models @xcite and possibly extended technicolor sectors to account for the fermion masses @xcite .",
    "other examples include top - mode condensate models @xcite and a strongly interacting higgs sector @xcite .",
    "an attempt to study the nonuniversal interactions of the top quark has been carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite by peccei et al .",
    "however , in that study only the vertex was considered based on the assumption that this is the only vertex which gains a significant modification due to a speculated dependence of the coupling strength on the fermion mass : @xmath6 , where @xmath7 parameterizes some new dimensional  four interactions among gauge bosons and fermions @xmath8 and @xmath9 . however , this is not the only possible pattern of interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , in some extended technicolor models @xcite one finds the nonuniversal residual interactions associated with the vertices , , and to be of the same order .    because of the great diversity of models proposed for possible new physics ( beyond the sm ) , it has become necessary to be able to study these possible new interactions in a model independent approach @xcite",
    "this approach has proved to render relevant non - trivial information about the possible deviations from the standard couplings of the heavier elementary particles ( heavy scalar bosons , the bottom and the top quarks , etc . )",
    "our study focuses on the top quark , which because of its remarkably higher mass is the best candidate ( among the fermion particles ) for the manifestation of these anomalous interactions at high energies @xcite .",
    "a common approach to study these anomalous couplings is by considering the most general on - shell vertices ( form factors ) involving the bottom and the top quarks together with the interaction bosons @xcite . in this work",
    "we will incorporate the effective chiral lagrangian approach @xcite , which is based on the principle of gauge symmetry , but the symmetry is realized in the most general ( non - linear ) form so as to encompass all the possible interactions consistent with the existing experimental data .",
    "the idea of using this approach is to exploit the linearly realized @xmath10 symmetry and the non - linearly realized @xmath11 symmetry to make a systematic characterization of all the anomalous couplings . in this way , for example , different couplings which otherwise would be considered as independent become related through the equations of motion .",
    "we show that in general low energy data ( including @xmath12 pole physics ) do not impose any stringent constraints on the anomalous dimension four coefficients @xmath13 of @xmath14 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) and @xmath15 , although our results can be trivially extended for the other fermion fields , e.g. flavor changing neutral interactions @xmath16-@xmath17-@xmath12 , etc . ] .",
    "this means that low energy data do not exclude the possibility of new physics whose effects come in through the deviations from the standard interactions of the top quark , and these deviations have to be directly measured via production of top quarks at the colliders .",
    "for instance , the couplings @xmath18 can be measured from the decay of the top quarks in @xmath19 pairs produced either at hadron colliders ( the fermilab tevatron and the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) ) or at the electron linear collider ( lc ) .",
    "they can also be studied from the production of the single - top quark events via , for example , @xmath20-gluon or @xmath20-photon fusion process @xcite .",
    "the coupling @xmath21 can only be sensitively probed at a future linear collider via the @xmath22 process because at hadron colliders the @xmath23 production rate is dominated by qcd interactions ( @xmath24 ) . however , at the lhc @xmath21 may also be studied via the associated production of @xmath23 with @xmath12 bosons ( this requires a separate study ) .",
    "also , we will include the next higher order dimension 5 fermionic operators and then examine the precision with which the coefficients of these operators can be measured in high energy collisions .",
    "since it is the electroweak symmetry breaking sector that we are interested in , we shall concentrate on the interaction of the top quark with the longitudinal weak gauge bosons ; which are equivalent to the would - be - goldstone bosons in the high energy limit .",
    "this equivalence is known as the goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite-@xcite .",
    "our strategy for probing these anomalous dimension 5 operators ( @xmath25 ) is to study the production of @xmath26 pairs as well as single-@xmath16 or @xmath27 via the @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( denoted in general as @xmath31 ) processes in the tev region . as we shall show later , based on a power counting method @xcite , the leading contribution of the scattering amplitudes at high energy goes as @xmath32 for the anomalous operators @xmath25 , where @xmath33 is the cm energy of the @xmath34 or @xmath35 system ( that produces @xmath36 ) , or the @xmath37 system ( that produces @xmath38 or @xmath39 ) . on the other hand , when the @xmath13 coefficients are set equal to zero the dimension 4 operators @xmath14 can at most contribute with the first power @xmath40 to these scattering @xmath31 processes . in other words ,",
    "the high energy @xmath41 scatterings are more sensitive to @xmath25 than to @xmath14 ( with @xmath13 s @xmath42 ) . if the @xmath13 s are not set equal to zero , then the high energy behaviour can at most grow as @xmath43 as compared to @xmath32 for the dimension 5 operators @xcite",
    ". furthermore , the dimension 4 anomalous couplings @xmath13 s are better measured at the scale of @xmath44 or @xmath45 by studying the decay or the production of the top quark at either the tevatron and the lhc as mentioned before , or the lc at the @xmath36 threshold ( for the study of @xmath12-@xmath16-@xmath16 ) .",
    "we show that there are 19 independent dimension 5 operators ( with only @xmath16 , @xmath15 and gauge boson fields ) in @xmath25 after imposing the equations of motion for the effective chiral lagrangian .",
    "the coefficients of these operators can be measured at either the lhc or the lc to magnitudes of order @xmath46 or @xmath47 after normalizing ( the coefficients ) with the factor is the cut - off scale of the effective theory .",

    "@xmath50 based on the naive dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "it is expected that at the lhc or the lc there will be about a few hundreds to a few thousands of @xmath36 pairs or single-@xmath16 or single-@xmath27 events produced via the @xmath31 fusion process .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section 2 we will introduce the basic framework of the non - linearly realized chiral lagrangian , in which the @xmath51 gauge symmetry is nonlinearly realized . in this approach , only the @xmath52 symmetry remains unbroken and thus the realization under this subgroup is linear as usual .",
    "we will set up a lagrangian with dimension 4 terms that will reproduce the couplings of the standard model type , as well as possible deviations .",
    "then , in sections 3 and 4 we discuss the constraints on the dimension 4 anomalous couplings from low energy data and the strategies to directly measure these couplings at the hadron or electron colliders . in sections 5 and 6",
    "we construct the complete set of dimension 5 couplings and discuss their effects to the production of top quarks in high energy regime via weak boson fusion processes .",
    "finally our conclusions are given in section 7 .",
    "we consider the electroweak theories in which the gauge symmetry @xmath53 is spontaneously broken down to @xmath54@xcite .",

    "in the following we shall discuss how to correctly treat the @xmath15-quark as a parton inside the proton to properly resum all the large logs to all orders in @xmath308 .",

    "the analytic expression for the flux ( @xmath310 ) of the incoming @xmath311-boson ( @xmath312 for longitudinal , right - handed , or left - handed polarization ) to rescatter with the @xmath15-quark can be found in ref .",
    "the constituent cross section of @xmath313 is given by ( u b d t ) & = & _ = 0,+,- f_(x = m^2_t ) ( t b w_^+ ) , where @xmath44 is the mass of @xmath275-boson and @xmath314 is the invariant mass of the hard part process . note that in order to derive the above result one has to assume that the dynamics of the hard part scattering , i.e. , @xmath315 , does not change dramatically from an off - shell ( @xmath316 ) to an on - shell ( @xmath317 ) @xmath20-boson .",
    "hence , the above equality is only valid under the effective-@xmath20 approximation even though the kinematic factors are correctly included .",
    "since the scattering rate of @xmath318 is proportional to the decay rate of @xmath319 , the production rate of single - top event from the @xmath20-gluon fusion process measures the partial decay width of the top quark @xmath306 .",
    "furthermore , the branching ratio of @xmath319 can be measured from the ratio of the numbers of double-@xmath15-tagged versus single-@xmath15-tagged @xmath2 events and the ratio of @xmath320 and @xmath321 rates in @xmath2 events for @xmath322 @xcite . combining this model - independent measurement of the branching ratio br(@xmath323 ) with the measurement of the partial decay width @xmath306 from the single - top production rate , one can determine the total decay width @xmath324 of the top quark , or equivalently , the lifetime ( @xmath325 ) of the top quark . at the run - ii of the tevatron",
    "we expect that the lifetime of the top quark will be known to about 20% @xmath326 30% . here",

    "nevertheless , the conclusion that the production rate of the @xmath20-gluon fusion event is proportional to the decay width of @xmath319 holds irrespective of the specific forms of the anomalous couplings ( even including higher order operators ) .",
    "hence , measuring the single - top event rate from the @xmath20-gluon fusion process is an _ inclusive _ method for detecting effects of new physics which might produce large modifications to the interactions of the top quark . strictly speaking , from the production rate of single - top events , one measures the sum ( weighted by parton densities ) of all the possible partial decay widths , such as @xmath328 , therefore , this measurement is actually measuring the width of @xmath329 where @xmath330 can be more than one particle state as long as it originates from the partons inside the proton ( or anti - proton ) .",
    "if new physics strongly enhances the flavor - changing - neutral - current @xmath16-@xmath17-@xmath12 , then the single - top production rate would also be enhanced from the @xmath12-@xmath17 fusion process @xmath331 .",

    "we note that to obtain the complete @xmath335 corrections beyond just the leading log contributions one should also include virtual corrections to the ( @xmath333 ) process , but we shall ignore these non - leading contributions in this work . using the prescription described above we find that when using the @xmath341 parton distribution function ( pdf ) cteq2l @xcite the total rate of the @xmath20-gluon fusion process is about @xmath342 smaller than the ( @xmath333 ) event rate either at the tevatron or at the lhc .    to estimate the uncertainty in the production rate due to the choice of the scale @xmath343 in evaluating the strong coupling constant @xmath308 and the parton distributions , we show in figure  [ scale ] the scale dependence of the @xmath20-gluon fusion rate for a sm top quark . as shown in the figure ,",
    "although the individual rate from either ( @xmath333 ) , ( @xmath336 ) , or the splitting piece is relatively sensitive to the choice of the scale , the total rate as defined by @xmath344 only varies by about 30% for @xmath345 at the tevatron .",

    "this uncertainty reduces to about 10% ( at the tevatron ) for @xmath346 . ranging from @xmath347 to @xmath348 . ]",
    "based upon the results shown in figure  [ scale ] , we argue that @xmath349 is probably not a good choice as the relevant scale for the production of the top quark from the @xmath20-gluon fusion process because the total rate rapidly increases by about a factor of 2 in the low @xmath343 regime . in view of the prescription adopted in calculating the total rate , the only relevant scales are the top quark mass @xmath45 and the virtuality of the @xmath20-line in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "since the typical transverse momentum of the quark ( @xmath350 ) which comes from the initial quark ( @xmath351 ) after emitting the @xmath20-line is about half of the @xmath20-boson mass , the typical virtuality of the @xmath20-line is about @xmath352gev .",
    "the scale @xmath353gev is thus not an appropriate one to be used in calculating the @xmath20-gluon fusion rate when using our prescription .",

    "it is easy to see also that based upon the factorization of the qcd theory @xcite the total rates calculated via this prescription will not be sensitive to the choice of @xmath341 pdf although each individual piece can have different results from different pdf s .    in conclusion , assuming @xmath295 , then @xmath151 can be constrained to within @xmath358 assuming a 20% uncertainty on the production rate of single - top quark from the @xmath20-gluon fusion process at the tevatron @xcite .",

    "a detailed monte carlo study on the measurement of these couplings at the lc including detector effects and initial state radiation can be found in ref .",

    "finally , we remark that at the lc @xmath151 and @xmath152 can be studied either from the decay of the top quark pair or from the single  top quark production process , @xmath20photon fusion process @xmath380 , or @xmath381 , which is similar to the @xmath20gluon fusion process in hadron collisions .",
    "so far we have discussed how to probe new physics effects that are expected to give some information about the symmetry breaking mechanism , as they can give rise to anomalous terms in the dimension 4 standard gauge couplings of the top quark with the electroweak bosons .",

    ". a complete analysis should include possible anomalous effective interactions of higher dimension . in this section",
    "we will construct the complete set of independent operators of the first higher order operators with dimension 5 , such that the complete effective lagrangian relevant to this study will be : @xmath382 where @xmath25 denotes the dimension 5 operators .",
    "our next task is to find all the possible dimension five hermitian interactions that involve the top quark and the fields @xmath383 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",

    "either @xmath426 , or @xmath427 needs to be considered .",
    "this time we choose the former , which can be proved to be nothing but the operator @xmath428 itself ( eq .  ( [ oa ] ) ) .",
    "the list of operators above is complete in the sense that it includes all non - equivalent dimension five interactions that satisfy gauge invariance .",
    "it is convenient now to analyze their cp properties . in order to make our study more systematic and clear we will re - write this list again , but",
    "this time we will display the added hermitian conjugate part in detail . by doing this the cp transformation characteristics will be most clearly presented too .",
    "let us divide the list of operators in two : those with only the top quark , and those involving both top and bottom quarks .",
    "let s begin by considering the operator @xmath429 .",
    "we will include an arbitrary constant coefficient , denoted as @xmath407 , which in principle could be complex : @xmath430 our hermitian operator has naturally split into two independent parts : one that preserves parity ( scalar ) , and one that does not ( pseudoscalar ) . also , the first part is cp even whereas the second one is odd .",
    "the natural separation of these two parts happens to be a common feature of all operators with only one type of fermion field .",
    "nevertheless , not always will the parity conserving part also be the cp even one , as we shall soon see .",
    "below , the complete list of all 7 operators with only the top quark is given .",
    "in all cases the two independent terms are included ; the first one is cp even , and the second one is cp odd .",
    "@xmath431 notice that in the operator @xmath432 the parity violating part happens to be cp even .",
    "this is because under a cp transformation a scalar term @xmath433 remains intact , i.e. it does not change sign , whereas a pseudoscalar term @xmath434 changes sign .",
    "the gauge bosons change sign too , and this is what makes the scalar part of the operator to change sign under cp .",
    "compare with the operator @xmath435 , there we have two bosons ; two changes of sign that counteract each other .",
    "therefore , it is the scalar part that is cp even in @xmath435 . furthermore , based on the naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) the coefficients of these operators are of order @xmath436 . therefore , the normalized coefficients ( the @xmath407 s ) are expected to be of order @xmath437 .",
    "below , we show the next list of 12 operators with both top and bottom quarks .",
    "again , we include an arbitrary complex coefficient stands for @xmath438 ; @xmath439 stands for @xmath440 . ] : @xmath441 in this case , if @xmath407 is real ( @xmath442 ) then @xmath443 and @xmath444 are both cp even , but @xmath413 , @xmath445 , @xmath446 and @xmath447 are odd . just the other way around if @xmath407 is purely imaginary .",
    "the dimension five lagrangian @xmath25 is simply the sum of all these 19 operators ( eqs .",
    "( [ fir ] ) to  ( [ las ] ) ): @xmath448    to study the possible effects on the production rates of top quarks in high energy collisions , only the cp conserving parts which give imaginary vertices ( like the sm ) are relevant .",
    "the amplitude squared will depend linearly on the cp even terms , but only quadratically on the cp odd terms , because the _ no - higgs _ sm ( @xmath14 ) interactions reproduces the sm without the physical higgs boson , we will refer to it as the _ no - higgs _ sm . ] are cp even when ignoring the cp - violating phase in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) mixing elements .",
    "however , this does not mean that it is not possible to probe the cp violating phase in the operators .",
    "later on in the next section we will show one observable that depends linearly on the cp odd coefficients . from now on , the appropriate cp even part ( either real or imaginary )",
    "is assumed for each coefficient . to simplify notation",
    "we will use the same label ; @xmath449 will stand for @xmath450 , @xmath451 will stand for @xmath452 , and so on , the only exception will be @xmath453 , whose real part is recognized as proportional to the magnetic moment of the top quark , and will be denoted by @xmath454 .",
    "it is thus understood that all coefficients below are real numbers .    in conclusion ,",
    "the dimension 5 lagrangian consists of 19 independent operators which are listed from eq .",
    "( [ fir ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ las ] ) .",
    "since the top quark is heavy ( its mass is of the order of the weak scale ) , it is likely to interact strongly with the goldstone bosons which are equivalent to the longitudinal weak gauge bosons in the high energy regime .",
    "( this is known as the goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite . )",
    "hence , we shall study in the rest of this paper how to probe these anomalous couplings from the production of top quarks via the @xmath31 fusion process , where @xmath455 stands for the longitudinally polarized @xmath59 or @xmath12 bosons .",
    "as it is suggested by the very form of these operators , we decide to probe their potential contribution to high energy scattering processes like longitudinal vector boson ( @xmath31 ) fusions ( see figure  [ fusion ] ) , and study how they can affect the production rates of top quarks in both the lhc and the lc . for simplicity , in this study we shall take all the non - standard dimension four couplings to be zero .",
    "a general result including these operators are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .    before doing any calculation at all",
    ", we can make an estimate of the expected sizes of these tree level amplitudes according to their high energy behavior .",
    "a general power counting rule has been given that estimates the high energy behavior of a scattering amplitude @xmath456 to be @xcite @xmath457 where @xmath458 ( @xmath280 is the number of external lines ; 4 in our case ) , @xmath459 for all dimension 4 operators and @xmath460 for all dimension 5 operators based upon the naive dimensional analysis ( nda ) as @xmath461 , @xmath462 as @xmath463 , and fermion fields as @xmath464 .",

    "the dimensionless coefficient @xmath479 contains possible powers of gauge couplings ( @xmath480 ) and yukawa couplings ( @xmath481 ) from the vertices of the amplitude @xmath482 , which can be directly counted .    at high energy",
    "the longitudinal components of the gauge bosons will dominate the production of top quarks coming from vector boson fusions , we will thus concentrate on their contribution from now on .",
    "according to the goldstone boson equivalence theorem ( et ) @xcite , in the high energy limit we can substitute the longitudinal external weak boson lines with the corresponding goldstone boson lines , and then perform a much easier calculation . in figure  [ power ]",
    "we show these diagrams for the @xmath483 process ( see also figure  [ fzz ] ) .",
    "let us start with the _ no - higgs _ sm dimension 4 lagrangian contribution to the process @xmath484 .",
    "it is convenient to use an alternative non - linear parameterization that is equivalent in the sense that it produces the exact same matrix elements @xcite , but with the advantage that the couplings of the fermions with the goldstone bosons do not contain derivatives , and we do not have to worry for high energy _",
    "gauge _ cancellations .",
    "the desired form of the sm lagrangian is given by @xmath485 in the above equation , @xmath486 is the hypercharge quantum number for the quark doublet , @xmath398 is the charge of the fermion , @xmath487 is the linearly realized left handed quark doublet , and @xmath488 is the right handed singlet for top or bottom quarks ( see eqs .",
    "( [ psi ] ) and ( [ psr ] ) ) .",
    "as we have just said , the advantage of using this parameterization for the _ no - higgs _ sm case is that once we have made the et substitution in the diagrams all the high energy cancellations due to gauge boson self - interactions ( that have nothing to do with the symmetry breaking sector ) will be already taken care of , and we will thus be evaluating directly the high energy behavior of a sm with no higgs boson .    when we expand the @xmath63 matrix field up to the second power ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigfield ] ) ) in the mass term of eq .",
    "( [ noder ] ) , we will notice two things : ( _ i _ ) the first power term gives the usual mass term and associates the coefficient @xmath489 to each vertex ; ( _ ii _ ) the second power term generates the four - point diagram ( figure  [ power](c ) ) with a coefficient @xmath490 associated to its vertex .",
    "as it is well known , a mass term always involves a chirality flip , therefore we readily recognize that this diagram will only participate when the chiralities of the top and anti - top are different . since in the high energy regime",
    "the mass is much smaller than the energy of the fermions , different chiralities mean equal helicities ( for the particle - antiparticle pair ) .",
    "hence , for the case of opposite helicities we only count the power dependance for diagrams 2(a ) and 2(b ) , and take the highest one . for final state fermions of equal helicities",
    "we consider all three diagrams .",
    "the results are the following : for diagrams 2(a ) and 2(b ) we have @xmath491 , thus the amplitude @xmath492 is of order @xmath493 ; which is the contribution given by the coefficients @xmath494 from both vertices .",
    "on the other hand , diagram 2(c ) has @xmath495 ; the equal helicities amplitude @xmath496 will be driven by this dominant diagram , therefore @xmath497 .",
    "for the other processes ; @xmath498 and @xmath499 , the analysis is the same , except that there is an extra _ s - channel _ diagram ( see figures  [ fww ] and  [ fwz ] ) that usually behaves just like the four point diagram  [ power](c ) .    for the dimension 5 anomalous operators we do not expect _ a priori _ any _ gauge _ cancellations at high @xmath500 .",
    "we therefore expect the parameterization used for our effective operators to reflect this high energy behavior . actually , the chiral lagrangian parameterization given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) , which organizes the new physics effects in the momentum expansion @xcite , is the only framework that allows the existence of such dimension 5 gauge invariant operators . on the other hand ,",
    "we know that as far as the _ no - higgs _ sm contribution to these _ anomalous _ amplitudes is concerned , it is better to use the equivalent parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ noder ] ) , because the right high energy contribution from this model is made easily and consistently",
    ". we will therefore use the appropriate couplings from @xmath501 and @xmath25 in our next power counting analysis .    in principle , we can evaluate the contribution to the diagrams 2(a ) and 2(b ) when both vertices are anomalous , but this would be suppressed by two powers of the cut - off scale ; we will just ignore it .",
    "we are only considering the contribution from one dimension 5 coupling at a time .",
    "as an example , let us take the operator with derivative on fermion @xmath502 and apply the expansions of the composite fields : @xmath503 where @xmath504 denotes the usual linearly realized top quark field , and @xmath505 includes the photon field of the covariant derivative , the higher ( than zeroth ) order terms from the spinor field expansion , and so on .",
    "the important thing to notice is that the second term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ ogzexp ] ) is the only one to consider , since all the others either have a lower energy dependance ( less derivatives ) or do not even represent the effective vertices relevant to the process of interest . without having to perform similar expansions for all the other operators we can infer that the important effective vertex will always contain two derivatives ; the coefficients @xmath494 will be @xmath506 for the three - point operators with one derivative on the goldstone boson field , and @xmath507 for four - point operators ( with two derivatives on the goldstone boson fields ) .",
    "nevertheless , two operators are an exception to this rule : @xmath508 and @xmath444 .",
    "for these operators the _ leading _ term vanishes ; let us expand the second one ( for example ) : @xmath509 as shown , we have the important term vanishing because of the contraction between the antisymmetric @xmath510 and the symmetric @xmath511 .",
    "hence , this operator will not contribute to the leading high energy behavior for top quark productions via @xmath31 fusion at tree level .",
    "it can only contribute to the part of the amplitudes that vanish as @xmath512 .",
    "as in the previous case of the _ no - higgs _ sm , we expect a distinction between the @xmath492 and @xmath496 amplitudes .",
    "actually , the situation is the same except for the fact that the anomalous vertex generated by the anomalous operators will yield a @xmath513 factor , whereas the dimension 4 sm operators yield a ( @xmath514 ) factor .",
    "therefore , @xmath515 for the first two diagrams 2(a ) and 2(b ) and thus @xmath492 is of expected to be of order @xmath516 on the other hand , diagram 2(c ) may be generated by either the direct contribution of four - point operators or the contribution from three - point operators when considering higher order terms in their expansion . in each case",
    "the anomalous operators contribute with a @xmath517 factor which yields @xmath518 , and the predicted value for @xmath496 is @xmath519    naturally , this power counting formula can not predict the fact that sometimes an amplitude can be zero due to the different helicities of spinors . for instance",

    "this means that contributions from operators of the _ scalar_-type , like @xmath435 , @xmath521 , @xmath502 , @xmath443 , and @xmath522 will vanish for @xmath523 amplitudes . also , we have the relation @xmath524 applicable to all three polarizations of external on - shell boson lines , which will make the contribution of operators with derivative on boson and scalar lorentz contraction like @xmath525 and @xmath526 to vanish in _",

    "( [ oa ] ) and ( [ ogww ] ) ) . after including the contributions from the _ no - higss _ sm and the above two cp - odd operators , the helicity amplitudes for the @xmath498 process in the @xmath548 cm frame are : @xmath552 where by @xmath553 and @xmath554 we refer to the imaginary parts of the coefficients of @xmath555 and @xmath521 , respectively .",
    "one of the cp - odd observables that can measure @xmath553 and @xmath554 is the transverse polarization @xmath556 of the top quark which is the degree of polarization of the top quark in the direction perpendicular to the plane of the @xmath498 scattering process .",
    "it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath557 which gives , up to the order @xmath463 , @xmath558 where @xmath33 is the cm energy of the @xmath559 system , and @xmath556 is defined to be a value between @xmath514 and @xmath437 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath560 tev , @xmath561 tev , and @xmath562 ( or @xmath563 ) , we obtain @xmath564 ( or @xmath565 ) ) .",
    "since @xmath556 is bounded to be @xmath437 by definition , this requires @xmath566 and @xmath567 .",
    "if we consider a @xmath545 tev @xmath568 collider with a number of @xmath36 events from @xmath548 fusion of approximately 100 ( which is approximately the _ no - higgs _ sm rate for a @xmath559 invariant mass between 800 gev and 1100 gev ) and assume that @xmath556 can be measured to about @xmath569 , then an agreement between data and the _ no - higgs _ sm prediction ( @xmath570 at tree level ) implies that @xmath571 for the case that @xmath572 .",
    "because top quark is heavy ( @xmath573 ) , it is likely that the interaction of the top quark can deviate largely from the sm predictions if the electroweak symmetry breaking and the generation of fermion masses are closely related . in this study , we have applied the electroweak chiral lagrangian to probe new physics beyond the sm by studying the couplings of the top quark to gauge bosons .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to only consider the interactions of the top and bottom quarks and not the flavor changing neutral current vertices like @xmath16-@xmath17-@xmath12 .",
    "furthermore , seeing the heaviness of the top quark as a possible indication that any new physics effects associated to the symmetry breaking ( and mass generating ) sector will manifest themselves preferably on this particle , we have considered only the couplings that involve the top quark as showing possible deviations from the standard values .",
    "( the vertex @xmath172 is considered unmodified . ) we introduced 4 effective coefficients : two that represent the non - standard couplings associated to the left and right handed charged currents @xmath151 and @xmath152 , and two more for the anomalous left and right handed neutral currents @xmath153 and @xmath154 . then , we used the precision lep data to set bounds on the couplings @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath151 , and we also discussed how the slc measurement of @xmath251 can modify these constraints .",
    "the right handed charged current coupling @xmath152 has to be constrained by means of the cleo measurement on @xmath574 .",
    "last , we showed how to improve our knowledge about the top quark nonstandard couplings at current and future colliders such as at the tevatron , the lhc , and the lc .",
    "because of the non  renormalizability of the electroweak chiral lagrangian one can only estimate the size of these nonstandard couplings by studying the contributions to lep / slc observables at the order of @xmath575 , where @xmath576 tev is the cutoff scale of the effective lagrangian",
    ". nevertheless , this does not mean we can not extract useful information . for instance , by assuming that the vertex is not modified , we found that @xmath153 is already constrained to be @xmath577 ( @xmath578 ) by lep / slc data at the 95% c.l .",
    "for a 160 ( 180 ) gev top quark . although @xmath154 and @xmath151 are allowed to be in the full range of @xmath579 , the precision lep / slc data do impose some correlations among @xmath153 , @xmath154 , and @xmath151 .",
    "( @xmath152 does not contribute to the lep / slc observables of interest in the limit of @xmath289 . )",
    "inspired by the experimental fact @xmath580 , reflecting the existence of an approximate custodial symmetry , we related @xmath153 and @xmath151 .",
    "then , the remaining two free parameters @xmath581 and @xmath582 get to be strongly correlated as well ( @xmath583 ) .",
    "we noted that the relations among the @xmath13 s can be used to test different models of electroweak symmetry - breaking .",
    "for instance , a heavy sm higgs boson ( @xmath584 ) will modify the couplings and of a heavy top quark at the scale @xmath45 such that @xmath585 , @xmath586 , and @xmath295 .",
    "another example is the effective model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where , @xmath587 , in which the low energy precision data impose the relation @xmath588 .",
    "on the other hand , the simple commuting extended technicolor model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite predicts that the nonstandard top quark couplings are of the same order as the nonstandard bottom quark couplings , and are thus small .    undoubtedly , direct detection of the top quark at the tevatron , the lhc , and the lc is crucial to measuring the couplings of and . at hadron colliders ,",
    "@xmath151 and @xmath152 can be measured by studying the polarization of the @xmath20 boson from top quark decay in @xmath2 events , and from the production rate of the single top quark event via @xmath20-gluon fusion , @xmath269 or @xmath271 processes .",
    "the lc is the best machine to measure @xmath153 and @xmath154 which can be measured from studying the angular distribution and the polarization of the top quark produced in @xmath371 collision .    if a strong dynamics of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism can largely modify the dimension 4 anomalous couplings , it is natural to ask whether the same dynamics can also give large dimension 5 anomalous couplings . in the framework of the electroweak chiral lagrangian",
    ", we have found that there are 19 independent dimension five operators associated with the top quark and the bottom quark system .",
    "the high energy behavior , two powers in @xmath500 above the _ no - higgs _ sm , for the @xmath589 processes , gives them a good possibility to manifest themselves through the production of @xmath590 pairs or single-@xmath16 or @xmath27 events at the lhc and lc in high energy collisions .",
    "since in the high energy regime a longitudinal gauge boson is equivalent to the corresponding would - be goldstone boson ( cf .",
    "goldstone equivalence theorem @xcite ) , the production of top quarks via @xmath31 fusions can probe the part of the electroweak symmetry breaking sector which modifies the top quark interactions . to simplify our discussion on the accuracy for the measurement of these anomalous couplings at future colliders",
    ", we have taken the dimension 4 anomalous couplings to be zero for this part of the study .",
    "also we have considered a special class of new physics effects in which an underlying custodial @xmath215 symmetry is assumed that gets broken in such a way as to keep the vertices of the bottom quark unaltered ( as was done for the dimension 4 case ) .",
    "this approximate custodial symmetry then relates some of the coefficients of the anomalous operators .",
    "then we study the contributions of these couplings to the production rates of the top quark .",
    "we find that for the leading contributions at high energies , only the s- and p - partial wave amplitudes are modified by these anomalous couplings if the magnitudes of the coefficients of the anomalous dimension 5 operators are allowed to be as large as @xmath437 ( as suggested by the naive dimensional analysis @xcite ) , then we will be able to make an unmistakable identification of their effects to the production rates of top quarks via the longitudinal weak boson fusions .",
    "however , if the measurement of the top quark production rate is found to agree with the sm prediction , then one can bound these coefficients to be at most of order @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "this is about a factor @xmath591 more stringent than in the case of the study of nlo bosonic operators via the @xmath592 scattering processes @xcite .",
    "hence , for those models of electroweak symmetry breaking for which the naive dimensional analysis gives the correct size for the coefficients of dimension 5 effective operators , the top quark production via @xmath31 fusions can be a more sensitive probe to ewsb than the longitudinal gauge boson pair production via @xmath31 fusions which is commonly studied . for completeness",
    ", we also briefly discuss how to study the cp - odd operators by measuring the cp - odd observables . in this paper",
    "we study their effects on the transverse ( relative to the plane of @xmath593 scattering ) polarization of the top quark .    in conclusion",
    ", the production of top quarks via @xmath31 fusions at the lhc and the lc should be carefully studied when data is available because it can be sensitive to the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism , even more than the commonly studied @xmath592 processes in some models of strong dynamics .",
