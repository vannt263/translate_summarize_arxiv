    "there is a great deal of field theory models describing a system in quenched random fields or coupling constants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , _",
    "etc_. ) . in solid state physics",
    "such models naturally arise the corresponding pure systems whenever impurities are introduced .",
    "it is interesting to extend randomness to other well - studied field theories , just as , for example in @xcite , disorder was implemented into minimal conformal models . as shown in @xcite and subsequent papers stochastic equations as well as the field theories in presence of random external sources often prove to possess some hidden supersymmetry .",
    "kurchan @xcite indorsed this result for spin glass dynamics .",
    "because supersymmetry handle perturbative corrections , such random theories are especially interesting .",
    "this is what we will do in this paper .    on the other hand in field theories with apparent space - time supersymmetry superpotential",
    "is holomorphic function not only of fields but also of coupling constants @xcite .",
    "therefore couplings and fields enter potential on equal footing , so that it seems very natural to introduce random ( gaussian ) distribution of some couplings in the lagrangian .",
    "but the power of supersymmetry is so strong that superpotential gets no quantum corrections @xcite , @xcite , i.e. provided that the coupling has no dynamical d - terms integrating it over solves the problem .    in section 2",
    "we formulate four - dimensional supersymmetric wess - zumino theory in random field .",
    "in the context of replica method infrared fixed points of one - loop @xmath1-functions are found in section 3 .",
    "analysis of these fixed points suggests two phases on the moduli space @xmath0 .",
    "numerical evaluation of the most general expressions is eventuated in the phase diagram which is illustrated by two simple examples of the fourth section .",
    "section 5 is devoted to discussions and conclusions .",
    "from above arguments it follows that the susy analog of a theory with disorder must contain dynamical terms for the random field . in the present paper",
    "we consider a four - dimensional wess - zumino model that is the supersymmetric counterpart of @xmath2-model ( the both theories are defined in the same critical dimension and the scalar potential after integrating auxiliary field in the former model is actually @xmath2 ) .",
    "since , according to @xcite , wess - zumino theory is defined only as a low - energy field theory , we will study the wilsonian effective action by integrating fast modes with momentum @xmath3 . thereby , let us define a chiral superfield @xmath4 and a random superfield @xmath5 . in this notations",
    "the original action is : s = d^4x d^2d^2 |(g ^+ - ^+h - h^++1 uh^+h ) + + + 1 3 !",

    "it may be obtained ( for the certain set of parameters ) from the usual wess - zumino action by the replacement @xmath6 , as one usually does in summation over local extremes @xcite .",
    "one of the most powerful method to deal with random fields is the replica trick @xcite , which we will use here to solve this `` toy '' model .",
    "it reduces to introducing @xmath7 copies ( replicas ) of our system , integrating @xmath5 field out , then solving @xmath7-replica problem and taking @xmath8 at the end of calculations .",
    "after replication the action ( [ action ] ) takes the form : s = d^4x d^2d^2 |+ + + 1 3 !",
    "d^4x d^2 + h.c .",
    "[ replact ]    as will be shown later the model depends only on the relative values of lambdas , so that one can put them small enough to determine @xmath5 field from the saddle point equation on d - term only : h = u _ a=1^n",

    "these equations have two remarkable properties : they are homogeneous in @xmath22 and @xmath23 , i.e. depend only on the squares of the both .",
    "such dependence on @xmath22 tells us that zeroes of beta - functions ( [ rg])-([rgg ] ) do not depend on the values of the couplings themselves , but only on their mutual ratios , so that the moduli space of the theory is @xmath24 instead of @xmath25 .",
    "therefore , without loss of generality , we may put couplings very small keeping their ratios fixed . in this limit",
    "the results that we are going to obtain are exact .",
    "moreover , in what follows we will assume @xmath26 , so that we can choose it to be @xmath27 and denote @xmath28 and @xmath29 ( affined map ) .",

    "the special case of @xmath32 will be studied in the first example of section 4 .",
    "quadratic dependence on @xmath23 in ( [ rgg ] ) means that for each set of general characteristics , such as @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , there are only two possible values @xmath36 ( if any ) which the function @xmath15 can take in a ir - fixed point .",

    "of course , this degeneracy will be removed by higher loop corrections , so that particular value of the fixed point will be determined by the full perturbative expansion . at the one - loop approximation , the explicit data @xmath50 in the fixed point",
