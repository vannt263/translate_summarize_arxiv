    "in the higgs mechanism , higgs coupling is proportional to a particle mass .",
    "for that reason , it is important to measure the higgs coupling to particle masses , i.e. higgs branching ratio , is important to confirm higgs mechanism and distinguish the standard model extensions .",
    "especially , it is the most important program to measure the branching ratio of @xmath0  and @xmath1  at ilc @xcite with the excellent performance of the flavor tagging .",
    "we have studied the measurement accuracy of higgs branching ratio at ilc by using @xmath3  events . in this paper",
    ", we report the measurement accuracy of higgs branching ratio of @xmath0  and @xmath1 .",
    "in this study , we used common generator samples in the ilc community for @xmath4 events and standard model backgrounds , which were prepared with witherd at slac @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the higgs mass was assumed to be 120 gev .",
    "we used the center of mass energy of @xmath2 gev and the integrated luminosity of 250 fb@xmath5 . here",
    ", the beam energy spread was assumed as 0.3% for the electron and positron beam .",
    "the beam polarization was set to 80% left - handed for the electron beam and 30% right - handed for the positron beam .",
    "the signal and background events were simulated by the full simulator , mokka@xcite , where the detector model is ` ild_00 ` was implemented as the detector model @xcite .",
    "hadronization was done by pythia6.409 , in which the higgs branching ratio is defined as shown in table [ tb : hbr ] for the higgs mass of 120 gev .",
