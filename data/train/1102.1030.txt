    "the traditional way of producing photon pairs is based on parametric downconversion in optical materials with a @xmath0 nonlinearity .",
    "nevertheless , over the past decade there has been increasing interest in photon pair generation based on four - wave mixing ( fwm ) .",
    "the latter types of sources were initially demonstrated in standard optical fibers  @xcite and microstructured fibers  @xcite .",
    "however , except when special precautions are taken , such as cooling the fibers , these fiber sources suffer from high noise level due to raman scattering .",
    "more recently , photon pair sources based on fwm in crystalline silicon ( c - si ) nanophotonic waveguides have been reported  @xcite . _ a priori _ , in this case",
    ", one would expect c - si souce of pairs to be noise - free , as there is negligible raman gain in bulk silicon at the wavelength at which photon pairs are generated .",
    "however , a carefull study  @xcite shows that uncorrelated photons do constitute a source of noise in this case , but almost two orders of magnitude smaller than in the case of fibers . in parallel with the development of c - si nanophotonics ,",
    "the past years have seen the emergence of hydrogenated amorphous - silicon ( a - si : h ) nanophotonics .",
    "a - si : h has a number of potential advantages with respect to c - si , which justifies the current interest in this technology .",
    "first of all , the material properties of deposited a - si : h can be tuned by adjusting the deposition parameters ; this could affect raman scattering as well as the bandgap energy .",
    "these flexibilities make a - si : h an attractive platform for nonlinear applications .",
    "secondly , as a - si : h can be deposited at relatively low temperatures , it could be deposited on many different substrates while keeping compatibility with the cmos process .",
    "furthermore , a - si : h waveguides can be stacked into 3-dimensional optical circuits , whereas c - si waveguides are restricted to planar architectures . finally , a - si : h waveguides can now be manufactured with losses comparable to c - si waveguides  @xcite . as a - si : h waveguides , have typically the same size as c - si waveguides , and as a - si : h material has @xmath1 nonlinearity comparable to c - si  @xcite , the efficiency of the photon pair generation process should be comparable in both structures , and both c - si and a - si : h waveguides appear to be potentially attractive sources of photon pairs . in the present work we report the first observation of photon pair generation in a - si : h nanophotonic waveguides at telecommunication wavelengths .",
    "in particular , we carry out a comparison between the rate of of photon pair generation in c - si and a - si : h waveguides .",
    "the silicon waveguides used in the present experiment were fabricated on a silicon wafer with 220  nm thick a - si : h on top of 2000  nm of @xmath2 .",
    "amorphous silicon was deposited using low temperature ( @xmath3c ) plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition process on top of 2  @xmath4 m @xmath2 layer  @xcite .",
    "after the a - si : h layer deposition phase , single mode 500  nm wide and 11.2  mm long waveguides were defined using 193  nm optical lithography and dry etching  @xcite .",
    "identical grating couplers were defined for in- and out - light - coupling . on the other hand ,",
    "waveguides made of crystaline silicon were fabricated with same section on top of a 2  @xmath4 m layer of @xmath2 .",
    "measurements made for amorphous ( resp .",
    "crystalline ) silicon waveguides revealed in / out - coupling losses around @xmath5  db ( resp .",

    "the power of the pump beam can be adjusted with a tunable attenuator so that for 0  db attenuation , the power before incoupling is 10  mw . a bandpass filter ( bpf )",
    "ensures absolute darkness at stokes and anti - stokes frequencies .",
    "this bpf is made of fiber bragg gratings , circulators and commercial dwdm add & drop filters ( 100  ghz on itu grid and centered at 1539.8  nm ) .",
    "overall , the bpf provides extinction greater than 150  db outside of the pump band 1538.9 - 1540.6  nm ( pump band ) .",
    "last dwdm filter of the bp has a short pigtail ( 10  cm ) to limit raman scattering in the fiber .",
    "+ correlated pairs are exhibited by deterministically splitting the photon pairs and optically delaying one of the photons .",
    "a first demultiplexer separated the pump beam from the pairs .",
    "a second demultiplexer selects two spectral band  : stokes from 1541.5 to 1558.5  nm and anti - stokes band from 1523 to 1538.5  nm .",
    "photons are detected thanks to superconducting single photon detectors ( from scontel ) cooled down to @xmath9  k ; efficiencies of detectors are @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite while dark counts are @xmath12  hz and @xmath13  hz .",
    "the time difference between both detections is measured with a time - to - digital converter ( tdc - agilent acquiris system ) so that the entire detection system can resolve coincidences with 80  ps resolution ( fwhm of a coincidence peak ) .",

    "this limits the rate at which coincidences can be measured by the tdc system and requires thus a calibration of the system for obtaining an absolute rate of coincidences .",

    "[ fig : pairflux ] . as expected , the pair flux @xmath23 grows quadratically with pump power @xmath21 .",
    "we also expected that the pair flux generated in a - si : h silicon is lower than in c - si because of higher propagation and in - coupling loss . as in - coupling loss is around 2  db higher , we would expect photon pair generation efficiency to be reduced by @xmath24 in comparison to efficiency in c - si .",
    "furthermore , propagation loss and out - coupling loss are both 2  db higher too , that would result in another reduction by @xmath25 (-8  db ) of the detected coincidences .",

    "[ fig : flux ] compares the fluxes generated in a - si : h and c - si in anti - stokes band . the higher flux generated in a - si : h waveguide despite higher propagation loss clearly indicates either a higher nonlinearity or a higher source of noise , or both .",
    "elsewhere  @xcite we study the origin of the weak noise that arises in c - si and demonstrated that this noise is not due to carrier dynamics but is related to a thermal population of phonons , probably raman scattering . in a - si : h , this noise source could be enhanced because of a broader raman resonance as it was demonstrated in porous si  @xcite .",
    "note that we are able to observe and quantify the noise in fig .",
    "[ fig : car ] because we operate in a cw regime , collect stokes and anti - stokes photons in a wide spectral band ( @xmath27  nm ) , and use detectors with very low dark count rates .",

    "we have observed that amorphous silicon has a higher kerr nonlinearity than c - si but also suffer from higher loss which results in an overall efficiency which is not as good as in c - si .",
    "nevertheless , a - si : h is more versatile , as it can be deposited on many substrates while keeping compatibility with cmos process , and as it allows for 3-dimensional architectures . this would certainly eases integration with other components required for linear optics quantum computer ( like detectors ) while keeping mechanical stability and straightforward combination with linear components ( interferometers , filters , beam splitters , ... ) .",
