    "an electron confined in such a state can not contribute to charge transfer at temperature @xmath3 .",

    "localizes all states and there is no mit at finite @xmath5 for non - interacting systems.@xcite    in the present study we consider the problem of anderson localization in three dimensional ( 3d ) disordered systems with anisotropic hopping .",
    "one might expect that increasing the hopping anisotropy , namely reducing the hopping probability in one ore two directions , is effectively equivalent to changing the dimensionality of the system continuously from 3d to 2d or 1d similarly to the case of ( bi)-fractal lattices.@xcite however , this is not the case : the topology of the lattice is not changed as long as the hopping is non - zero and the dimensionality is still three . only if the coupling is reduced to zero the dimension jumps from 3d to 2d or 1d .",
    "previous studies using the transfer - matrix method ( tmm)@xcite and multifractal analysis ( mfa)@xcite showed that an mit exists even for very strong anisotropy .",
    "the values of the critical disorder @xmath0 were found to decrease by a power law in the anisotropy , reaching zero only for the limiting 1d or 2d cases . in the present work ,",
    "we focus our attention on the critical properties of this mit . as an independent check to previous results , we employ energy level statistics ( els)@xcite together with the finite - size scaling ( fss ) approach .",
    "els has been previously applied with much success at the mit of the isotropic model and it was shown that a size - independent statistics exists at the mit.@xcite this _ critical _ statistics is intermediate between the two limiting cases of poisson statistics for the localized states and the statistics of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) which describes the spectrum of extended states.@xcite we check whether the critical els is influenced by the anisotropy .    a major part of our study is dedicated to the determination of the critical exponent @xmath6 of this second - order phase transition .",
    "in general it is assumed that @xmath6 depends only on general symmetries , described by the universality class , but not on microscopic details of the sample .",
    "thus , anisotropic hopping might shift @xmath0 but should not change @xmath6 . in order to verify this assumption it is necessary to determine @xmath6 with high accuracy for various anisotropies .",
    "this is a computationally demanding task and we emphasize that even in numerical studies of the isotropic anderson model the correct value of @xmath6 is still not entirely clear .",

    "the transfer integrals @xmath22 are restricted to nearest neighbors and depend only on the three spatial directions , so @xmath22 can either be @xmath23 , @xmath24 or @xmath25 .",

    "for @xmath29 we recover the isotropic case , @xmath30 corresponds to @xmath31 independent planes or @xmath32 independent chains .",
    "the statistical properties of the energy spectra reflect the character of the eigenstates and have been proven to be a powerful tool for characterizing the mit.@xcite on the insulating side of the mit , one finds that localized states that are close in energy are usually well separated in space whereas states that are localized in vicinal regions in space have well separated eigenvalues .",
    "consequently , the eigenvalues on the insulating side are uncorrelated , there is no level repulsion and the probability of eigenvalues to be close together is high .",
    "this is called level clustering and is described by the poisson statistics.@xcite on the other hand , extended states occupy the same regions in space and their eigenvalues become correlated .",
    "this results in level repulsion such that the spectral properties are given by the goe statistics.@xcite    in an infinitely large disordered system , the mit corresponds to a sharp transition from goe statistics at the metallic side to poisson statistics at the insulating side via some intermediate critical statistics only exactly at the critical point.@xcite in a finite system , this abrupt change is smeared out , because the divergence of the characteristic lengths  such as the localization length  of the wave functions at the phase transition is cut off at the system size .",
    "if for a given @xmath5 the localization length in the infinite system is much larger than the system size under consideration , the states appear to be extended in the finite system .",
    "their eigenvalues become correlated and the els is changed from poisson towards goe statistics . to obtain a reliable characterization of the mit one should therefore investigate the system - size dependence of the spectral properties : with increasing system size",
    "there is a trend towards the limiting cases of goe and poisson statistics for the extended and localized regions , respectively .",
    "directly at the critical disorder there are no characteristic length scales , the wave functions are scale - invariant multifractal entities@xcite and the statistical properties of the spectrum are independent of the system size.@xcite      in els a system is characterized by the local fluctuations of the energy spectrum around its average density of states ( dos ) @xmath33.@xcite usually , @xmath34 is not constant for a given sample and has different width or even different shape for different samples .",

    "the character of the eigenstates has been shown not to change in a large energy interval around @xmath45.@xcite for the computation of the spectral properties we therefore use an interval centered at @xmath45 containing 50% of the eigenvalues.@xcite furthermore we average over a number of configurations of the potential site energies such that at least @xmath46 , but typically @xmath47 to @xmath48 , eigenvalues contribute to @xmath37 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 for every @xmath31 , @xmath5 , and @xmath51 .",
    "altogether we investigated about 750 such parameter combinations .",
    "as expected , we find a crossover from goe statistics to poisson statistics with increasing @xmath5 for all values of @xmath51 considered and both , coupled planes and chains . as an example",
    "we show @xmath49 for weakly coupled chains in fig .",

    ", we consider the integral @xmath56 as a function of @xmath5 for several system sizes @xmath31.@xcite as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : d3 ] , the value of @xmath57 monotonically increases as the els changes from goe to poisson statistics . in the localized region @xmath57 will therefore increase with @xmath31 , whereas it will decrease with @xmath31 for extended states .",

    "[ fig : wc ] this is an appropriate description for our els data and agrees well with the results of our previous mfa.@xcite for coupled planes this result is also consistent with a previous tmm study and a perturbative analysis employing the coherent potential approximation ( cpa)@xcite but in the case of coupled chains @xmath63 appears more appropriate than the result @xmath64 of ref .  .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the question whether the form of the size - independent statistics at the mit @xmath65 depends on anisotropy .",
    "it seems to be settled  at least for the isotropic case  that the small-@xmath38 behavior of @xmath65 is equal to that of the metallic phase with @xmath66 as usual for the orthogonal ensemble , @xmath67 for the unitary , and @xmath68 for the symplectic ensembles.@xcite furthermore , it was shown that the large-@xmath38 behavior of @xmath65 and @xmath69 can be described by an exponential decay @xmath70 with @xmath71 for all three universality classes.@xcite all these studies were performed for 3d using periodic boundary conditions and cubic samples . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath65 has been shown to depend on the sample shape@xcite and on the applied boundary conditions as well.@xcite a trend towards poisson behavior was found when the cube was deformed by increasing or decreasing the length in one direction@xcite or when periodic boundary conditions were changed to dirichlet in one , two , or three directions.@xcite thus @xmath72 decreases from @xmath73 towards @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath72 depends on the dimensionality since in the orthogonal 4d case the critical @xmath65 was found to be closer to poisson statistics than in 3d.@xcite from the 4d results one might expect the opposite effect for our coupled planes and chains .",
    "this is not the case and we also find a trend towards poisson statistics for increasing @xmath51 as can be seen , e.g. , in fig .   [",
    "fig : is_krit ] for coupled planes .",
    "this finding is consistent with the mfa results@xcite where the singularity spectra at the transition were found to tend towards the localized behavior with increasing anisotropy .",
    "while investigating the dependence on the sample shape we observe another interesting behavior . in the isotropic case , when deforming the cubic sample to a cuboid , the statistical properties of the spectra always tend towards poisson statistics , irrespective of whether the sample becomes a long quasi-1d bar or a flat quasi-2d sample.@xcite here we compute @xmath49 for coupled planes with @xmath59 at @xmath75 for two cases : ( i ) bar - shaped samples of size @xmath76 extending in the direction with reduced hopping and ( ii ) flat samples of size @xmath77 with large weakly coupled planes .",
    "we insert the results into fig .",
    "[ fig : is_krit ] .",
    "surprisingly we find an opposite trend for the two cases : ( i ) for the bars @xmath49 is close to poisson statistics , very similar to @xmath69 for @xmath78 ; ( ii ) for the flat samples @xmath49 is close to goe statistics and the isotropic @xmath69 is nearly recovered .",
    "this result is probably due to the fact , that the system sizes in case ( ii ) are proportional to the localization lengths , which depend on the direction.@xcite the extension of the wave function measured in units of its characteristic lengths is then equal in all directions .",
    "we remark that a similar observation in 2d anisotropic samples exists : the isotropic scaling function is recovered , if the dimensions of the system are proportional to the localization lengths.@xcite we expect that a further increase of the aspect ratio , i.e. , reduction of the system towards 2d , will drive @xmath49 again towards poisson statistics . but",
    "this needs further study .",
    "we remark , that the increasing fluctuations for @xmath79 in the @xmath49 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : is_krit ] are due to the fact , that there are only very few such large spacings .",
    "consequently , there is no good statistics . in tests with large poisson sequences of up to @xmath80 eigenvalues ,",
    "we find similar small but increasing deviations from the theoretical result for @xmath79 .",
    "the mit in the anderson model of localization is expected to be a second - order phase transition,@xcite which is characterized by a divergence in an appropriate correlation length @xmath81 with critical exponent @xmath6 , where @xmath82 is a constant.@xcite here @xmath83 is the correlation length of the _ infinite _ system , but in practice only finite , and still relatively small , systems are numerically accessibly . in order to construct a thermodynamic limit , scaling laws @xmath84 are applied to the finite - size data @xmath85 . here",
    "@xmath86 denotes a dimensionless system property to be specified later and @xmath87 is an arbitrary scale factor.@xcite the scaling law has solutions of the form @xmath88 which implies that the system size @xmath31 can be scaled by @xmath83 such that all @xmath85 collapse onto a single scaling function @xmath89 . for a system with an mit ,",
    "this scaling function consists of two branches corresponding to the localized and the extended phase . in numerical experiments",
    "the reduced localization length @xmath90 obtained by the tmm is often used as quantity @xmath86.@xcite scaling has also been shown for quantities derived from els , particularly for @xmath58 defined in sec .",
    "[ sec - els - wc].@xcite    for the estimation of the critical exponent @xmath6 , one can numerically perform the fss procedure@xcite in order to determine the scaling function @xmath91 by minimizing the deviations of the data from the common scaling curve .",
    "after construction of the scaling curve , one can then fit the obtained scaling parameters @xmath83 according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrlength ] ) .",
    "however , the divergence of @xmath83 at @xmath0 is rounded because of numerical inaccuracies.@xcite on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq : corrlength ] ) is not expected to be valid far away from @xmath0 and it is a priori very difficult to determine an appropriate disorder range for the fit .",
    "there are several possibilities of determining @xmath6 directly from @xmath85 , thereby avoiding the numerical inaccuracies introduced by the scaling procedure .",

    "one can also find a similar expression where @xmath86 is replaced by @xmath94.@xcite although both expressions are equivalent close to the mit , they can give different results due to finite precision numerics .",
    "another complication appears due to the presence of a systematic shift of the crossing point of the @xmath93 curves visible , e.g. , in highly accurate tmm data.@xcite such a shift occurs also in our els data , but it is less prominent than in the mentioned tmm studies and can barely be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_w ] .",
    "the shift is not described by eq .",
    "( [ eq : x_w_dep ] ) .",
    "the first attempt to overcome this problem was adding a correction term @xmath95 to eq .",
    "( [ eq : x_w_dep ] ) which depends on @xmath31 but not on @xmath5.@xcite this correction allows us to determine @xmath6 without an assumption about the nature of the shift . however , the value of @xmath0 is not accessible in this procedure since a change in @xmath0 can be compensated by changing the correction @xmath96 accordingly .",
    "alternatively one can assume that the small deviations from one - parameter scaling are caused by an irrelevant scaling variable , i.e. , the presence of additional terms in ( [ eq : x_w_dep ] ) with system - size dependence @xmath97 , with @xmath98 , which vanish for large system sizes .",
    "this approach takes into account that the shift is not random but rather appears to be systematic .",
    "we use such a method introduced recently.@xcite a family of fit functions is constructed , which includes two kinds of corrections to scaling : ( i ) an irrelevant scaling variable and ( ii ) nonlinearities of the disorder dependence of the scaling variables . starting point is the renormalization group equation ( or scaling function ) for @xmath86 @xmath99 @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the relevant and irrelevant scaling variables with corresponding critical and irrelevant exponents @xmath6 and @xmath102 , respectively .",

    "choosing the orders @xmath114 up to which the expansions are carried out , one can adjust the fit function to the data set .",
    "if there is a single crossing point , an irrelevant scaling variable is not necessary and @xmath104 is set to zero . in order to recover the linear behavior ( [ eq : x_w_dep ] ) , one chooses @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "however , we emphasize that the linear region around @xmath0 is very small and a simple scaling with eq .",

    "for larger @xmath5 ranges , @xmath117nd or @xmath118rd order terms are necessary for the fit . setting @xmath119 or @xmath120 to two or three yields appropriate fit functions .",

    "there is an alternative method developed for els which should give very accurate results with a relatively small number of data points.@xcite the data @xmath93 for constant @xmath31 are fitted with third - order polynomials and these functions are used to generate a large number of new data points for which the fss procedure@xcite is employed .",

    "even an excellent @xmath132 value does not guarantee useful results for the fitted model parameters .",
    "for completeness we also used the fit method@xcite described at the end of sec .",
    "[ sec - exponent ] .",
    "the third - order polynomials are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : alpha_w ] and the scaled data in fig .",
    "[ fig : scalf_alpha ] .",
    "the scaling is almost perfect , which is not surprising because of the effective smoothing of the data by means of the cubic fits .",
    "the scaling function is very similar to that from fit f which gives the same critical exponent @xmath159 .",
    "but as mentioned before , it is very difficult to derive a reliable @xmath6 and its error estimate with this method .",
    "in the present work we have studied the metal - insulator transition in the 3d anderson model of localization with anisotropic hopping . we used els together with fss analysis to characterize the mit .",
    "our results indicate in agreement with previous studies that a transition exists for any anisotropy @xmath160 for coupled planes and for coupled chains .",
    "we find a power - law decay of the critical disorder with increasing anisotropy . for coupled chains",
    "the decay is found to be faster than predicted by previous cpa results.@xcite a large part of the present work is devoted to the determination of the critical exponent @xmath6 .",
    "we calculated the integral @xmath58 over the @xmath14 statistics with very large system sizes and high accuracy for the case of coupled planes with @xmath59 . in order to determine @xmath6 we used a method to fit the data introduced by slevin and ohtsuki@xcite which allows for corrections to scaling due to an irrelevant scaling variable and nonlinearities in the disorder dependence of the scaling variables .",
    "it turns out that it is not necessary to take into account an irrelevant scaling variable . by varying the ranges of system size and disorder",
    "we find a large number of fits , which all describe the data remarkably good .",
    "one expects that the estimates for @xmath6 from all these fits are consistent within the error bars .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath161 confidence intervals do not always overlap .",
    "apparently , the error estimate from the fit procedure does not reflect the possible fluctuations in @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore , we find a systematic shift towards larger values of @xmath6 if only the largest system sizes are considered .",
    "this might indicate the existence of finite - size corrections not included in the ansatz .",
    "taken all these into account we conclude @xmath1 . considering the accuracy of our data and the large system sizes used , this error estimate appears surprisingly large when compared to previous estimates .",
    "we presume that most specified errors in similar studies are somewhat optimistic . within the error bars ,",
    "our result is consistent with highly accurate tmm studies for the goe case.@xcite this supports the concept of universality classes , from which one expects no change of the critical exponent for anisotropic hopping .",
    "the els data at the mit are independent of the system size , but they depend on anisotropy . for increasing anisotropy",
    "we find a trend from the isotropic form towards poisson statistics .",
    "since it was found that the critical statistics also depends on boundary conditions and on the shape of the sample,@xcite as well as on the dimensionality,@xcite one might doubt the validity of the very attractive concept of a super universality class@xcite characterizing the critical point in all universality classes .",
    "that concept is based on the observation of very similar critical exponents and agreement of the large-@xmath38 behavior of @xmath37 at @xmath0 in the isotropic anderson model .",
    "we believe that at present the accuracy in the determination of the critical properties does not allow for an entirely convincing validation of this concept ."
