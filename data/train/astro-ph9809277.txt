    "galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) have long been known to be a significant source of lithium , beryllium , and boron nucleosynthesis ( reeves , fowler , & hoyle @xcite ; meneguzzi , audouze , & reeves @xcite ) .",
    "these elements are produced via spallation and fusion reactions between cosmic ray nuclei and those in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "indeed , until the 1990 s it was thought that libeb are _ predominantly _ synthesized in this way ( except for 7 and perhaps 11 ) .",
    "estimates of the accumulation of libeb over the age of galaxy , using the observed , present - day gcr flux and ism abundances ( e.g. , walker , mathews , & viola @xcite ) , can reproduce roughly the right _ solar system _ values for the absolute abundances and the isotopic ratios of 6 , 9 , and 10 .",
    "some question remained about 7 and 11 , which seemed to require additional nucleosynthesis sources , but the agreement was seen as a confirmation of the basic gcr nucleosynthesis process as the source of libeb .    our picture of libeb production was partially confirmed and partially challenged in the past decade , when data became available on libeb _ evolution _ in prior epochs .",
    "specifically , observations revealed the pattern of elemental abundances of libeb versus fe in both disk and halo ( population i and ii ) stars . while elemental li is dominated at low metallicity by the `` spite plateau '' arising from the primordial component , be and b show no such plateau , but rather scale with metallicity .",
    "thus , be and b have no significant primordial component as was to be expected from standard models of big bang nucleosynthesis ( thomas @xcite , delbourgo - salvador & vangioni - flam @xcite ) , and have a galactic production site , in accordance with the basic `` galactogenetic '' hypothesis of reeves , fowler , & hoyle .    however , the same stellar data that showed be and b to have a galactic origin also threw into question the `` standard '' libeb nucleosynthesis scenario of gcr spallation on ism nuclei .",
    "the observed be- and b - fe relations show logarithmic slopes ( for brevity , `` slopes '' ) much closer to 1 than to 2 . however , in standard gcr nucleosynthesis , be and b are `` secondary '' since the production rate of be and b depends on the abundance of the `` primary '' target nuclei c , n , and o in the ism .",
    "thus , in this scenario , be and b have slope 2 versus , say , oxygen . occurs in addition to cno spallation ( e.g. , steigman & walker @xcite ) .",
    "] therefore , _ if o and fe abundances are proportional to one another _ in pop ii stars , the be and b data are in conflict with standard gcr nucleosynthesis .",
    "the data have thus been interpreted as requiring both primary be and primary b. in particular , when one normalizes to the solar abundances , the difference between the primary and secondary production is largest at low metallicities and hence early epochs . thus the be and",
    "b data in halo ( pop ii ) stars apparently suggest a need for other nucleosynthesis sites in the early galaxy for these element isotopes .    of",
    "the primary mechanisms suggested , most involve accelerated particle interactions , but one  the `` neutrino process''is a stellar mechanism ( woosley @xcite ; olive @xcite , woosley & weaver @xcite ) .",
    "the  occurs as the onion - skin layers of a supernova are traversed by the intense neutrino flux .",
    "inelastic neutrino collisions with nuclei in the carbon and helium shells can lead to the production of 11 and 7 .",
    "this mechanism is a `` primary '' one , in that a `` seed '' abundance is not needed in the supernova s progenitor for the  to occur . since most current stellar abundance data measures only the elemental abundance of b , the  alone could explain the b - fe trend , though adjustments are needed to fit the solar 11/10 ( olive , prantzos , scully , & vangioni - flam @xcite , vangioni - flam , cass , fields , & olive @xcite ) .",
    "even if the  is responsible for the pop ii trends in b , the @xmath2-process makes no be .",
    "thus , the observed trend of be versus fe , with slope near 1 , apparently demands an additional primary source of be which dominated in the early galaxy .",
    "one proposed mechanism invokes a flux of accelerated particles that are localized to star forming regions ( cass , lehoucq , & vangioni - flam @xcite ; ramaty , kozlovsky , & lingenfelter @xcite )",
    ". these particles would be energetic ( i.e. , above the thresholds for libeb spallation production ) , but non - relativistic , and dominated by c and o nuclei .",
    "this mechanism is in part motived by @xmath3-ray observations of @xmath4 and @xmath5 lines in orion , which are only explained as the result of such a population of energetic particles .",
    "another mechanism posits the direct acceleration of supernova ejecta ( duncan , lambert , & lemke @xcite ; ramaty , kozlovsky , lingenfelter , & reeves @xcite ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the c and o component is assumed to dominate the composition , but the energetic particles are now at relativistic energies .    thus we see that the apparently primary nature of the b - fe and be - fe trends has driven the need for new libeb production in the early galaxy . given the far - reaching implications of such new production , it is worthwhile to scrutinize the empirical basis of the primary behavior . here",
    "we wish to re - examine critically whether the b - fe and be - fe slopes necessarily imply primary origins for b and be .",
    "in fact , a better and more direct indicator of the nucleosynthetic origin of be and b is oxygen .",
    "this is well known , but it has been thought that o / fe is constant in pop ii , so that fe can act as a surrogate for o. however , we will discuss recent data which suggests that o / fe may not be constant . using recent pop ii oxygen data for halo stars , we find that the be - o and b - o slopes at present suffer from systematic effects , the result of which is that the slopes may lie in the range 1.3  1.8 .",
    "interestingly , this range of uncertainty lies between the values of 1 and 2 arising for primary and secondary origins , respectively .",
    "thus it is unclear on the basis of these data alone whether primary or secondary production occurred in the early galaxy .    in the face of this uncertainty",
    ", we reconsider in this paper the standard gcr nucleosynthesis scenario , in which 6 and 7 are effectively primary in pop ii ( due to @xmath6 reactions ; montmerle @xcite ; steigman & walker @xcite ) , and 9 and 10 are secondary .",
    "of course , since the observed meteoritic 11/10 isotopic ratio can not be fit by standard ( relativistic ) gcr processes , one must add something to this scenario to fit even the solar abundances .",
    "we will adopt the point of view that the @xmath2-process does occur , and must contribute to 11 ( and probably 7 as well ) .",
    "indeed , we know supernovae are intense neutrino sources , and so spallative production must occur at some level .",
    "of course , the solar isotopic data on 7 and 11 demand that some additional process , other than conventional gcr spallation , produces at least these isotopes .",
    "if we take the @xmath2-process yields seriously , then this contributes a primary component to pop ii 11 ( and thus elemental b ) , which in turn demands that be and b slopes differ , and thus that b / be rises toward low metallicities ( olive @xcite , fields , olive & schramm @xcite ) . given the @xmath2-process , there would not be a strong requirement for other ( primary ) sources of b. thus , the only evidence driving the need for additional primary sources of libeb is the be data .    in",
    "what follows we will review the beb data with respect to both fe and o. we find that the data is particular vulnerable to systematic effects which depend on the stellar atmospheric parameters such as surface temperature and gravity . due to these uncertainties ,",
    "it is unfortunately not possible with the present data to determine unambiguously the primary versus secondary nature of be .",
    "we then ask , if be indeed has an origin in standard gcrs throughout the history of the galaxy , what are the implications for libeb and cosmic ray evolution if this is true ?",
    "we find that simple chemical evolution models can obtain good fits to be and b vs o and fe .",
    "acceptable beb vs ofe evolution can arise not only in simple closed box scenarios , but also in open box models which allow for galactic outflows ( scully et al .",
    "we find that although the effect of galactic winds is to flatten the be evolution , the effect is not significant enough to change the slope by one unit",
    ". finally , we point out further empirical tests which can determine whether a new and separate cosmic ray component is required to operate in the early galaxy .",
    "in order to model and test existing models of the synthesis and evolution of the libeb isotopes , it is essential to have reliable abundance data . to derive abundances from the observed line strengths",
    ", one must adopt a model stellar atmosphere models . in practice ,",
    "reported abundances use different assumptions in the model atmospheres for all stars ; e.g. , whether one imposes local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) or not ( nlte ) .",
    "in addition , somewhat different parameters are adopted for the same star , e.g. , surface gravity , @xmath7 , or . to meaningfully derive and compare trends for different elements across metallicities , it is thus crucial to systematize the stellar atmosphere models that underly the abundances . in",
    "what follows , where multiple measurements exist for a given star , we will combine them systematically at a common set of stellar parameters to determine the abundances of be / h , b / h and o / h as was done in vangioni - flam ( @xcite , hereafter vroc ) . unfortunately , the choice for these parameters is not unique and their choice can have a significant effect on the evolutionary trends for be and b as we show below .",
    "having a dominant primordial component at low metallicities , 7 differs from the other element isotopes we are considering . for our purposes here , galactic libeb production is constrained by 7 only in that models must respect the spite plateau in metallicity . in most cases ,",
    "this is not a problem .",
    "there is of course an observed rise in the 7 abundance at [ fe / h ] @xmath8 -1 , but we will not address the issue of late 7 production here .",
    "we will assume a spite plateau value of li / h @xmath9 ( molaro , primas , & bonifacio @xcite , bonifacio & molaro @xcite ) .",
    "we will also not go into detail concerning 6 here ( the question of 6 will be treated in vangioni - flam , cass , olive & fields @xcite ) .",
    "we do note here however , that the @xmath10 fusion process which produces 6 in addition to spallative processes ( see e.g. steigman & walker @xcite ) , is effectively a primary process .",
    "if be was in fact a secondary element as in the standard model of gcr nucleosynthesis , the 6/9 ratio would change with metallicity as appears to be the case when one compares this ratio in halo stars ( see e.g. recent observations of 6 by smith , lambert , & nissen @xcite , cayrel @xcite ) to the solar value .",
    "the logarithmic abundances of be and b scale with those of heavy elements .",
    "there is no evidence as yet of a primordial component , which from the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis is expected to be unobservably small ( thomas @xcite , delbourgo - salvador & vangioni - flam @xcite ) given current observational capabilities . the be and b data can be fit versus using logarithmic abundances so that , [ eq : slope_def ] [ be ] =  +  const we will focus on the logarithmic slope @xmath11 ; the same procedure , applied to boron , gives @xmath12 .",
    "[ be ] is defined as @xmath13(be / h ) + 12 .    to determine the slopes @xmath11 and @xmath12",
    ", one needs to choose a consistent set of stellar parameters .",
    "one choice advocated by molaro , primas , & bonifacio to obtain reliable 7 abundances , is to use surface temperatures as given by fuhrmann , axer , & gehren based on balmer lines .",
    "this approach was used in vroc for obtaining the be - fe and b - fe correlation .",
    "the specific beb data used for these fits was discussed in vroc and we refer the reader there for more details . here",
    "we have also adjusted the surface gravity and iron abundances to match those given by axer , fuhrmann , & gehren .",
    "these results for the be - fe and b - fe slopes for [ fe / h ] @xmath14 -1 , appear in table [ tab : data ] and are very similar to those obtained in vroc",
    ". however , this choice of stellar parameters based on balmer line observations is not unique .",
    "an alternative is to use data based on the infra - red flux method ( irfm ) of alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger .",
    "this was used by bonifacio & molaro for 7 as well and gave very consistent results ( with balmer line method ) for the 7 abundance in the spite plateau .",
    "the irfm of alonso , arribas , & martinez - roger was used by israelian , garcia lopez , & rebolo to obtain oxygen abundances in halo stars , and we have also adopted these parameters to adjust the be and b abundances so that we again are utilizing a consistent parameter set . the results for the be and b slopes based on the irfm are also shown in table [ tab : data ] .",
    "as one can see , the be and b show a clear departure from the quadratic ( slope = 2 ) dependence on [ fe / h ] commonly expected in standard gcr nucleosynthesis for both the balmer line and irfm parameter choices .",
    "in fact these results are entirely consistent with one another . in the case of b / h , there are two points at low metallicity which stand out due to an nlte correction that has been applied .",
    "if we use only the lte abundance data for b / h ( though we have no reason to suspect a problem with the nlte corrections that have been applied ) the slope becomes @xmath15 and is not qualitatively different than the nlte case .",
    "we will discuss the be - o and b - o trends below .",
    "as in the case of 6 , the isotopic ratio 11/10 in pop ii stars is determined via isotopic splitting , in this case at @xmath16 . also similar to 6 , this is a difficult observation .",
    "rebull et al .   made a first attempt at measuring this in hd 76932 , which has @xmath17 , and @xmath18 ( israelian , garcia lopez , & rebolo @xcite ) and found a possible blended line . if the 2090   feature is unblended and entirely due to b , then @xmath19 .",
    "if an ( unknown ) blend is present , then the ratio could be as low as @xmath20 .",
    "further work is needed to address the issue of blending .",
    ".observed pop ii logarithmic slopes for be and b versus fe and o [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : runs ]    as a benchmark case we consider a closed box model . as we will see below , the quality of the fit to the depends on the adopted imf slope @xmath21 , where we put @xmath22 .",
    "we find that for a closed box , the best fit has an imf @xmath23 , which is a good approximation to high - mass end of the local disk imf .",
    "the slopes appear in table [ tab : runs ] , and the evolution curves appear in figures [ fig : beb - o_cl_b ] , [ fig : libeb - fe_cl_b ] , and [ fig : bbe - fe_b]a along with the balmer data . from the table , we see that the be - o slope is 1.98 , very close to ( but less than ) two , as expected for a purely secondary product .",
    "the b - o slope is near ( but larger than ) one , indicating that in the range of the fit , the primary component of @xmath2-process 11 dominates , but the secondary component has some contribution as well . as the figures show , the models provide a good fit to the data for the both the abundances and the ratios .- process yields in our scheme are unable to fit the solar 7 ; this need not be a problem as other sources of pop ii 7 have been proposed ( e.g. , agb stars ) . ]",
    "consequently , this example from a full chemical evolution model supports the conclusion of our phenomenological analysis (  [ sect : beb - o ] ) : it is possible that 6beb evolution can be explained solely by a combination of standard gcr nucleosynthesis and the @xmath2-process .",
    "having established the benchmark case , we turn to open box models .",
    "we will explore the effect adding an enriched wind to models with a bulk wind . here",
    "we use a shallower imf , @xmath24 , which has the needed effect of increasing the stellar yields to compensate for the metals lost in the wind .",
    "the results are not strongly sensitive to the strength of the bulk wind , with the best fits coming from values around @xmath25 ( with @xmath26 much lower , the bulk wind has no effect ; much higher , and models lose too many metals and gas ) .",
    "in contrast , the models are much more sensitive to the strength of the enriched wind , as seen in table [ tab : runs ] , and in figures [ fig : bbe - fe_b]b , [ fig : beb - o_e+b - wind_b ] , and [ fig : libeb - fe_e+b - wind_b ] .",
    "the most important point is that the open box models do not change the libeb evolution dramatically ; the basic trends are very similar .",
    "still , we do see in table [ tab : runs ] as expected , @xmath27 is slightly but systematically lowered due to the earlier ( in @xmath28 ) onset of gas depletion .",
    "more importantly , we see that as @xmath29 increases , the beb curves turn over at lower metallicity ; this arises due to the lowered effective oxygen yield @xmath30 , which causes the gas mass ( and target reservoir ) to drop faster versus o ( see eq .  [ eq : l - hiz ] ) .",
    "the lower turnover improves the fit , since the curves are forced to go through the solar point , and a shallowly positive or even negative slope at this point effectively raises the curve at the pop ii metallicities .",
    "finally , we note that the @xmath31 case , in comparison to the closed box case , gives a sense of the effect of a change in the imf . here again , the key is the yield , which is lower in the closed box case ( steeper imf ) , leading to the same improvement in fit seen via lowering the effective yield .    in terms of the overall fit of the outflow model curves to the balmer data ,",
    "we see that the @xmath32 model does particularly well . in the balmer case ,",
    "the be slope of about 2 is reduced , and the b slope is increased which in fact better matches the data . the reduction in",
    "the be is slope is not however enough to match the irfm data .",
    "again , this model serves as an example of 6beb evolution explained by a gcr + @xmath2-process scenario .",
    "furthermore , it is encouraging that one can find a solution within a wind model as well as a closed box . comparing the @xmath32 and the closed box model",
    ", we see that the two are quite similar , but the wind model in fact gives a slower evolution in b / be , and thus a somewhat better fit to the few pop ii b / be points .    the outflow models of figures [ fig : bbe - fe_b]b , [ fig : beb - o_e+b - wind_b ] , and [ fig : libeb - fe_e+b - wind_b ] . are plotted along with the irfm data in figures [ fig : beb - o_e+b - wind_i ] , [ fig : libeb - fe_e+b - wind_i ] , and [ fig : bbe - fe_b]c . as anticipated in  [ sect : beb - o ] , here the fit to b - o is not very good .",
    "this comes about due to the primary , @xmath2-process component of 11 which makes too much boron at early times .",
    "this excess boron appearly mostly starkly in b / be . indeed , as suggested by the b / be slopes of table [ tab :",
    "data ] , the irfm data shows no evidence for a change in the b / be slope .",
    "the difference between the fits in figures [ fig : bbe - fe_b]b and [ fig : bbe - fe_b]c points to the seriousness of the systematic errors in the data , and the inability of the data to discriminate at present between different schemes for 6beb origin and evolution . by the same token , the difference between figures [ fig : bbe - fe_b]b and [ fig : bbe - fe_b]c also highlights a golden opportunity for observers : if the data can be improved , it will be become possible to distinguish between the different evolutionary hypotheses , and to rule in or out whole classes of light element models .",
    "interestingly , we find that some chemical evolution models which have been invoked to solve the g - dwarf problem are not compatible with a good solution to the o - fe or beb - o trends .",
    "in particular , neither sequential nor bimodal outflow help to get the large o - fe demanded by data , though these models were constructed to give good fits to the g - dwarf distribution ( scully et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in the case of sequential models ,",
    "the first burst of star formation builds up floor of metals which then act as targets for the renewed burst of star formation .",
    "the beb curves thus have early- and late - time solutions which are unchanged , but in the transition region beb grows rapidly , introducing a `` jump '' in the beb versus metal curves .",
    "this behavior leads to a bad fit , since it effectively lowers the pop ii trend relative to that of pop i. a similar but weaker effect arises in a bimodal model .",
    "we believe that this behavior is characteristic of any model which has in effect a prompt initial enrichment to solve the g - dwarf problem .",
    "finally , we note the changed role of be production energetics in our scenario .",
    "the energy production per be atom is a powerful diagnostic for models ( ramaty , kozlovsky , lingenfelter , & reeves @xcite ) , as it links the be production to the needed energy budget . however , this diagnostic is not as useful if the o / fe slope is not equal to 0 .",
    "if be is secondary versus o / h , its production in this case depends on the ism abundances and so the `` energy per atom '' scaling is metallicity dependent : clearly , the energy that a pop ii supernova invests in cosmic rays leads to a lower payoff in beb than the same cosmic ray blast from a pop i supernova , due to the decrease in number of cno targets .",
    "the energetics argument requires the near constancy of be / fe . by changing o / fe",
    ", one could have a be / h evolution which is secondary with respect to o / h , but as we have shown , has a slope close to unity with respect to fe / h .",
    "even if be / fe is roughly constant , it does not necessary follow that there is constant energy budget per be atom .",
    "indeed , the possibility that o / fe is not constant has implications beyond our present study , since this means that at least one of o or fe is not a simple surrogate for `` number of supernovae , '' and that one must be careful in assigning a single `` metallicity '' for a given epoch .    to summarize , our numerical results support conclusions suggested by the more approximate analytic treatment , in showing that be",
    "could well have its nucleosynthetic origin in the traditional , `` secondary , '' process of gcr spallation in the interstellar medium .",
    "the situation for b is less clear , largely due to the paucity of b data , but the b - o slope also seems to indicate that b may have a similar origin in the gcr nucleosynthesis process , though the differences in the b and be slopes versus fe suggest that b might also have a significant primary component , presumably the @xmath2-process .",
    "fortunately , the scenario we propose here is testable is several ways , as we now discuss .",
    "we have scrutinized the issue of primary versus secondary be and b , examining both the trends in the data itself , and in models for libeb nucleosynthesis .",
    "phenomenological , analytical , and numerical analyses all suggest that 6 , be , 10 , and part of 11 may have their origin in the traditional gcr nucleosynthesis process . the key impetus for this re - evaluation",
    "is in new o data in pop ii stars , which suggests that o / fe is not constant with @xmath33 .",
    "this implies immediately that be and b slopes versus fe are not direct indicators of nature of the libeb origin , since o and not fe should be a direct tracer of this origin . at present , the data are too uncertain to _ require _ this scenario , but it is intriguing to find that this traditional mechanism might be allowed .    using recent pop ii data on o / fe - fe ,",
    "we have analyzed the observed beb - ofe trends .",
    "we find that systematic errors leave the o data too uncertain to allow strong conclusions regarding the origin of libeb .",
    "specifically , using one ( consistent ) set of stellar atmospheric parameters , we find that be - o shows a strong hint of a secondary origin , but using another set of atmospheric parameters , be - o appears to have a strong primary component . despite these uncertainties ,",
    "it is of note that the ( better measured ) beb - fe trends show a significant sign of a changing b / be ratio , and with the recent o / fe - fe data can be consistent with a secondary be - o relation .",
    "these phenomenological findings are supported by detailed numerical calculation of libeb galactic chemical evolution .",
    "we are able to construct both closed box and outflow models in which 6beb arise from a combination of standard gcr nucleosynthesis and the @xmath2-process and can fit the observed trends ( within the systematic errors in the o data and o / fe - fe ) .",
    "we emphasize that just as the _ present _ pop ii data are too uncertain to decisively test our scenario , they also can not unambiguously test alternative scenarios which posit primary origin for pop ii beb ( e.g. , duncan , lambert , & lemke @xcite ; cass , lehoucq , & vangioni - flam @xcite ; ramaty , kozlovsky , lingenfelter , & reeves @xcite ) .",
    "however , these two basic scenarios differ sharply in their predictions , and so are exceedingly amenable to observational tests .",
    "we note that elemental and isotopic ratios have very different histories in the two scenarios , and thus can provide clear signatures .",
    "specifically , in the scenario we propose and 11 are all primary but be and 10 are secondary .",
    "consequently , key new or improved observations include ( in rough order of priority ) :    1 .",
    "accurate determinations of b / be within the same stars , as a function of metallicity .",
    "the difference in the observed be - fe and b - fe slopes suggests that this ratio should indeed change . if the evolution of ratio could be well - determined , it would give the most direct indication ( or refutation ) of different primary and secondary origins for be and b. 2 .",
    "determination of a consistent set of stellar paramters .",
    "one of our main results is that the primary / secondary nature of beb is undetermined because of the large systematic uncertainties that arise from the choice of stellar parameters such as effective temperature , surface gravity and metallicity . in particular ,",
    "if we are to understand the evolution of these elements with respect to o / h or fe / h , we need to have reliable abundance determinations for o / h and fe / h . these are not currently available in the literature .",
    "3 .   measurement of 6/9 .",
    "if be is secondary , then pop ii 6/9 should be much higher than solar since pop ii li is primary ; e.g. , in our best models , @xmath34 at @xmath35 . however , if be also has primary component that dominates in pop ii , then 6/9 should be constant in pop ii , with a change in pop i as the normal gcr component becomes important .",
    "thus , even a rough determination of 6/9 should constrain the be origin .",
    "4 .   determination of 11/10 for pop ii stars . if the @xmath2-process dominates the b production at early times , this ratio would provide a strong signature ( e.g. , in our best models , @xmath36 at @xmath37 ) . furthermore , the predicted ratio varies so strongly in primary versus secondary models for 10 that even rough determinations of this ratio would be worthwhile . to date",
    ", there has only been one attempt at measurement , we encourage future attempts to improve the limit .    in deriving trends from any of these or other observations , we again stress the importance of using consistent atmospheres .",
    "since the effect of different model atmosphere inputs can be large , to compare trends it is essential to use stellar atmosphere models which are consistent within and across stars .",
    "we conclude by reiterating a main theme of this paper , that the basic nature of beb nucleosynthesis and evolution hangs on pop ii observations of o in halo stars and a determination of whether o / fe is constant or changing in pop ii .",
    "indeed , the ( consistently derived ) correlation of o with fe , be , and b is key to any understanding of light element production in the early galaxy .",
    "we strongly urge improved observations of o and more systematic and consistent study of pop ii abundances to shed light on this issue .",

    "<S> because of the roughly linear correlation between be / h and fe / h in low metallicity halo stars , it has been argued that a `` primary '' component in the nucleosynthesis of be must be present in addition to the `` secondary '' component from standard galactic cosmic ray nucleosynthesis . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we critically re - evaluate the evidence for the primary versus secondary character of li , be , and b evolution , analyzing both in the observations and in galactic chemical evolution models . while it appears that [ be / h ] versus [ fe / h ] has a logarithmic slope near 1 , it is rather the be - o trend that directly arises from the physics of spallation production . using new abundances for oxygen in halo stars based on uv oh lines </S>",
    "<S> , we find that in pop ii stars for which o has been measured , the be - o slope has a large uncertainty due to systematic effects . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the be - o logarithmic slope lies in the range @xmath0 , rendering it difficult to distinguish from the data between the secondary slope of 2 and the primary slope of 1 . </S>",
    "<S> the possible difference between the be - fe and be - o slopes is a consequence of the variation in o / fe versus fe : recent data suggests that the best - fit o / fe - fe slope for pop ii is in the range -0.5 to -0.2 , rather than zero ( i.e. , fe @xmath1 o ) as is often assumed . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to this phenomenological analysis of be and b evolution , we have also examined the predicted libeb , o , and fe trends in galactic chemical evolution models which include outflow . based on our results , it is possible that a good fit to the libeb evolution requires only traditional the galactic cosmic ray spallation , and the ( primary ) neutrino - process contribution to 11 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus suggest that these two processes might be sufficient to explain 6 , be , and b evolution in the galaxy , without the need for an additional primary source of be and b. however , the uncertainties in the data at this time prevent one from reaching a definitive conclusion . </S>",
    "<S> fortunately , several observational tests of this `` neoclassical '' scenario are available ; we note in particular the importance of further observations to secure the o / fe pop ii trend , as well as accurate measurements of b / be , 6/be , and 11/10 in halo stars .    # 1 ( ) # 1([#1 ] )    # 1#23.6pt    # 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 1#1    # 1#1 # 1#2#3    # 1#2    -1 in </S>"
