    "much of what we know about excited baryon states has grown out of simple nonrelativistic quark models of their structure .",
    "these models were originally proposed to explain the systematics in the photocouplings of these states , which are extracted by partial - wave analysis of single - pion photoproduction experiments .",
    "this method can only give us information about baryon states which have already been produced in @xmath0 elastic scattering , since a knowledge of the coupling constant for the outgoing @xmath1 channel is necessary for the photocoupling extraction .",
    "photoproduction experiments have also tended to have limited statistics relative to the @xmath0 elastic scattering experiments .",
    "the traditional theoretical approach is to describe the nucleon and its excitations using wavefunctions from nonrelativistic potential models , which describe baryons as being made up of ` constituent ' quarks moving in a confining potential .",
    "this potential is provided by the interquark ` glue ' , which is taken to be in its adiabatic ground state .",
    "the quarks interact at short distance via one - gluon exchange .",
    "the electromagnetic current is also calculated using a simple nonrelativistic expansion of the single - quark transition operator , _",
    "i.e. , _ in the nonrelativistic impulse approximation . not surprisingly , the resulting photocouplings and electroexcitation helicity amplitudes are frame dependent , with the problem becoming more severe when the photon transfers more momentum ; current continuity is also violated .",
    "this is partly due to the nonrelativistic treatment , and partly due to the lack of two and three - body currents which must be present in this strongly - bound system .",
    "much more can be learned about these states from exclusive electroproduction experiments .",
    "the photocouplings are the values of transition form factors at the real - photon point @xmath2 ( here @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the four - momentum transferred from the electron ) ; electroproduction experiments measure the @xmath5 dependence of these form factors , and so simultaneously probe the spatial structure of the excited states and the initial nucleons .",
    "both photoproduction and electroproduction experiments can be extended to examine final states other than @xmath1 , in order to find ` missing ' states which are expected in symmetric quark models of baryons but which do not couple strongly to the @xmath1 channel  @xcite .",
    "such experiments are currently being carried out at lower energies at mit / bates and mainz .",
    "many experiments to examine these processes up to higher energies and @xmath5 values will take place at cebaf .",
    "the success of nonrelativistic quark models in describing the systematics of baryon photocouplings does not extend to the electroproduction amplitudes .",
    "the best measured of these amplitudes are those for elastic electron - nucleon scattering , the nucleon form factors . in a simple nonrelativistic model",
    "the charge radius of the proton is too small by a factor of almost two , and the form factors fall off too rapidly at larger @xmath5 values .",
    "it has been suggested that the problem with the charge radius is due to the neglect of relativistic effects  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the poor behavior at large @xmath5 can be improved by going beyond the nonrelativistic approximation  @xcite and by enlarging the limited ( gaussian ) basis in which the wavefunctions are expanded  @xcite .",
    "similar problems exist in the description of the @xmath5 dependence of the transition form factors for the @xmath6 resonance , which are also quite well measured .",
    "although the experimental information about the transition form factors for higher mass resonances is limited  @xcite , there are serious discrepancies between the predictions of the nonrelativistic model and the extracted amplitudes here also  @xcite .",
    "it is clear that , once the momentum transfer becomes greater than the mass of the constituent quarks , a relativistic treatment of the electromagnetic excitation is necessary .",
    "a consistent approach involves two main parts .",
    "first , the three - body relativistic bound - state problem is solved for the wavefunctions of baryons with the assumption of three interacting constituent quarks .",
    "then these wavefunctions are used to calculate the matrix elements of one- , two- and three - body electromagnetic current operators .",
    "results of model studies of the relativistic three - nucleon problem are available  @xcite , and the problem of three constituent quarks in baryons is presently under investigation  @xcite ( see also the comments in the final section ) . a useful first step is to consider transitions between substates in a general basis in which such wavefunctions may be expanded , such as a harmonic - oscillator basis .",
    "one can then examine successive approximations to the baryon wavefunctions with these un - mixed oscillator basis states as a starting point .",
    "there are many competing approaches to the calculation of electromagnetic currents in relativistic bound states ; we will use light - front relativistic hamiltonian dynamics  @xcite here .",
    "the basis of this approach is to treat the constituents as particles rather than fields .",
    "it allows for an exact relativistic treatment of boosts , by removing the dependence on the interacting mass operator of the boost generators . as a consequence certain rotations become interaction dependent . within this framework",
    ", one can set up a consistent impulse approximation , which minimizes the effects of many - body currents  @xcite .",
    "current continuity can be enforced , though , as we shall see , not uniquely , and one can explicitly evaluate the degree to which the currents have the required rotational covariance properties  @xcite .",
    "other authors have applied similar models to the study of these problems ; chung and coester  @xcite , schlumpf  @xcite , weber  @xcite , and aznaurian  @xcite have studied nucleon elastic form factors in light - cone models with simple nucleon wavefunctions , and these models have been extended to the electroproduction amplitudes for the @xmath7 resonance by weber  @xcite , in a model based on light - cone field theory , and by aznaurian  @xcite .",
    "bienkowska , dziembowksi and weber  @xcite have also applied a light - cone model to the study of the small electric - quadrupole @xmath8 multipole in @xmath6 electroproduction , and weber  @xcite has also applied his model to the @xmath9 resonance .    our goal is to examine the sensitivity of these photoproduction and electroproduction amplitudes to relativistic effects . within the crude approximation of identifying un - mixed harmonic - oscillator wavefunctions with the states that they represent in zeroth order in the harmonic basis",

    "( [ mha ] ) .",
    "the choice of which multipole to constrain is then usually obvious ; for example in the case of a transition between a nucleon an excited state with @xmath113 , there are three multipoles : the coulomb multipole with @xmath114=(0,0,0 ) , magnetic ( 1,1,1 ) , and electric multipoles ( 1,1,0 )",
