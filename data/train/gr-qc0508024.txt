    "the neutrinos , in the standard model of elementary particle physics , are assumed to be massless . by the discovery of the neutrino oscillations ,",
    "this assumption became invalidated .",
    "the neutrinos are massive , even though they carry , as compared to the electron , only very small masses . then the _ photon _ is left as the only known massless and free elementary particle .",
    "the gluons do not qualify in this context since they are confined and can not exist as free particles under normal circumstances .",
    "consequently , the photon is the only particle that is directly related to the light cone @xmath4 and that can be used for an operational definition of the light cone ; here @xmath5 is the metric of spacetime , @xmath6 a coordinate differential , and @xmath7 .",
    "we are back  as the name light cone suggests anyway  to an electromagnetic view of the light cone .",
    "speaking in the framework of classical optics , the _ light ray _ would then be the elementary object with the help of which one can span the light cone .",
    "we take `` light ray '' as synonymous for radar signals , laser beams , or electromagnetic rays of other wavelengths .",
    "it is understood that classical optics is a limiting case , for short wavelengths , of classical maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics .    in other words , if we assume the framework of maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics , we can derive , in the geometric optics limit , light rays and thus the light cone , see perlick @xcite and the literature given there .",
    "however , the formalism of maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics is interwoven with the riemannian metric @xmath5 in a nontrivial way .",
    "accordingly , in the way sketched , one can never hope to find a real derivation of the light cone .",
    "therefore , we start from the _ premetric _ form of electrodynamics , that is , a metric of spacetime is not assumed .",
    "nevertheless , we can derive the generally covariant maxwell equations , expressed in terms of the excitation @xmath0 and the field strength @xmath1 , from the conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux .",
    "we assume a local and linear spacetime relation between @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    ". then we can solve the maxwell equations .",
    "in particular , we can study the propagation of electromagnetic waves , and we can consider the geometrical optics limit . in this way",
    ", we derive the light rays that are spanning the light cone . in general",
    ", we find a _",
    "quartic _ wave covector surface ( similar as in a crystal ) that only reduces to the pseudo - riemannian light cone of general relativity if we forbid _ birefringence _",
    "( double refraction ) in vacuum .",
    "hence , in the framework of premetric electrodynamics , the local and linear spacetime relation , together with a ban on birefringence in vacuum , yields the pseudo - riemannian light cone of general relativity .",
    "accordingly , the geometrical structure of a riemannian spacetime is derived from purely electromagnetic data .",
    "we consider that as our contribution to the einstein year 2005 , and we hope that going beyond the geometrical optics limit will yield better insight into the geometry of spacetime .    the axiomatic scheme that we are going to present here is already contained in our book @xcite where also references to earlier work and more details can be found . in the meantime we learnt from the literature that appeared since 2003 ( see , e.g. , delphenich @xcite , itin @xcite , kaiser @xcite , kiehn @xcite , and lindell & sihvola @xcite ) and improved our derivation of the light cone , simplified it , made it more transparent ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the formalism and the conventions we take from @xcite .",
    "in our approach , we start from a 4-dimensional spacetime manifold that is just a continuum which can be decomposed locally in ( 1-dimensional ) time and ( 3-dimensional ) space .",
    "it carries no metric and it carries no ( linear or affine ) connection . as such it is inhomogeneous .",
    "it does nt make sense to assume that a vector field is constant in this continuum",
    ". only the constancy of a scalar field is uniquely defined .",
    "also a measurement of temporal or spatial intervals is still not defined since a metric is not yet available .    in technical terms , the spacetime is a 4-dimensional connected , hausdorff , paracompact , and oriented differential manifold .",
    "on such a manifold , we assume the existence of a foliation : the spacetime can be decomposed locally into three - dimensional folios labeled consecutively by a monotonically increasing `` prototime '' parameter @xmath8 , see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",

    "we can use the notion of the _ lie derivative _ of a @xmath20-form @xmath13 along a vector field @xmath21 , i.e. , @xmath22 , and can introduce the derivative of a transversal field @xmath23 with respect to prototime as @xmath24",

    ", there may also exist vacuum .",
    "matter is divided into electrically charged and neutral matter . turning to the physics of the former",
    ", we assume that on the spatial folios of the manifold we can determine an electric charge @xmath25 as a 3-dimensional integral over a charge density and a magnetic flux @xmath26 as a 2-dimensional integral over a flux density .",
    "this is at the bottom of classical electrodynamics : spacetime is filled with matter that is characterized by charge @xmath25 and by magnetic flux @xmath26 . for neutral matter",

    "one can catch single electrons and single protons in traps and can _ count _ them individually .",
    "thus , the electric charge conservation is a fundamental law of nature , valid in macro- as well as in micro - physics .",
    "accordingly , it is justified to introduce the absolute dimension of charge @xmath27 as a new and independent concept .",

    "since the lenz rule is related to the positivity of the electromagnetic energy , the same is true for the lorentzian signature .",
    "this derivation of the signature of the metric of spacetime from electrodynamics provides new insight into the structures underlying special as well as general relativity .",
    "at first the skewon and the axion emerged at the premetric level in our theory and only subsequently the metric .",
    "consequently , the axion and the skewon should be regarded as more fundamental fields ( if they exist ) than the metric . in the meantime",
    ", we phased out the skewon field since we insisted , in sec.[vanishing ] , on vanishing birefringence in vacuum .",
    "as to the metric , we recognize that multiplication of the metric by an arbitrary function @xmath202 was left open in the derivation of the last section , see : @xmath203 thus , only the conformally invariant part of the metric is determined . in other words",
    ", we have actually constructed the _ conformal _ ( or the light cone ) _ structure _ on the spacetime manifold , see , e.g. , weyl @xcite , schouten @xcite , and pirani & schild @xcite .",
    "it is known from _ special relativity _ that the light cone ( with lorentzian signature ) is invariant under the 15-parameter conformal group , see barut & raczka @xcite and blagojevi @xcite .",
    "the latter , in minkowskian coordinates @xmath204 , is generated by the following four sets of spacetime transformations : @xmath205 here @xmath206 are the 15 constant parameters , and @xmath207 .",
    "the poincar subgroup ( [ transl ] ) , ( [ lor ] ) ( for a modern presentation of it , see giulini @xcite ) leaves the spacetime interval @xmath208 invariant , whereas the dilatations ( [ dil ] ) and the proper conformal transformations ( [ proper ] ) change the spacetime interval by a scaling factor @xmath209 and @xmath210 , respectively ( with @xmath211 ) . in all cases the light cone @xmath212 is left invariant .",
    "the weyl subgroup , which is generated by the transformations ( [ transl])-([dil ] ) , and its corresponding noether currents were discussed by , e.g. , kopczyski et al .",
    "@xcite .    for massless particles , instead of the poincar group ,",
    "the conformal or the weyl group come under consideration , since massless particles move on the light cone .",
    "even though the light cone stays invariant under all transformations - , two reference frames that are linked to each other by a proper conformal transformation do nt stay inertial frames since their relative velocity is not constant . if one wants to uphold the _ inertial _ character of the reference frames , one has to turn to the weyl transformation , that is , one has to specialize to @xmath213 .",
    "the conformal group in minkowski space illustrates the importance of the light cone structure on a _",
    "flat _ manifold .",
    "this is suggestive for the light cone on an arbitrarily curved manifold , even though there is no direct relation between - and the light cone structure we derived in the last section .",
    "the light cone metric @xmath214 introduces the hodge star @xmath215 operator .",
    "we then can straightforwardly verify that the principal part of the spacetime relation is determined as @xmath216 , where the coefficient of proportionality can be an arbitrary scalar function @xmath217 of the spacetime coordinates .",
    "this function is naturally identified with the _ dilaton field _ , see brans @xcite and fujii & maeda @xcite . introducing the ( levi - civita ) dual of the excitation , @xmath218 , we can then finally rewrite the spacetime relation for vanishing birefringence in vacuum as @xmath219\\,f_{kl}\\,,\\label{nobirefr}\\ ] ] that is ,",
    "we are left with the constitutive fields dilaton @xmath220 , metric @xmath214 , and axion @xmath106 .",
    "the combination @xmath221j}(x)$ ] is conformally invariant , in complete agreement with the above analysis .",
    "the conformal structure of spacetime is laid down in . hence only 9 of the 10 independent components of the pseudo - riemannian metric @xmath5 are specified .",
    "we need , in addition to the conformal structure , a _ volume measure _ for arriving at a unique riemannian metric .",
    "this can be achieved by postulating a time or length standard .    in exterior calculus , ( [ nobirefr ] ) reads @xmath222 the axion has not been found so far , so we can put @xmath223 .",
    "moreover , under normal cicumstances , the dilaton seems to be a constant field and thereby sets a certain scale , i.e. , @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is the admittance of free space the value of which is , in si - units , @xmath226 .",
    "( the exact implementation of this assumption will have to be worked out in future . ) accordingly , we are left with the spacetime relation of conventional maxwell - lorentz electrodynamics @xmath227",
    "weyl @xcite , in 1921 , proved a theorem that the projective and the conformal structures of a metrical space determine its metric uniquely .",
    "as a consequence weyl @xcite argued that _ ... the metric of the world can be determined merely by observing the `` natural '' motion of material particles and the propagation of action , in particular that of light ; measuring rods and clocks are not required for that .",
    "_ here we find the two elementary notions for the determination of the metric : the paths of a freely falling point particles , yielding the projective structure , and light rays , yielding the conformal structure of spacetime .",
    "later , in 1966 , pirani and schild @xcite , amongst others , deepened the insight into the conformal structure and the weyl tensor .    in 1972 , on the basis of weyl s two primitive elements , ehlers , pirani , and schild ( eps ) @xcite proposed an axiomatic framework in which weyl s concepts of free particles and of light rays were taken as elementary notions that are linked to each other by plausible axioms . requiring compatibility between the emerging projective and conformal structures , they ended up with a weyl spacetime(riemannian metric with an additional weyl covector ) .",
    "they set a scale [ as we did in the last section , too ] and arrived at the pseudo - riemannian metric of general relativity . in this sense , eps were able to reconstruct the metric of general relativity .    subsequently , many authors improved and discussed the eps - axiomatics .",
    "access to the corresponding literature can be found via the book of majer and schmidt @xcite or the work of perlick @xcite and lmmerzahl @xcite , e.g .. for a general review one should compare schelb @xcite and for a new axiomatic scheme schrter @xcite .    as stated , the point particles and light rays were primary elements that were assumed to exist and no link to mechanics nor to electrodynamics was specified .",
    "the particle concept within the eps - axiomatics lost credibility when during the emergence of gauge theories of gravity ( which started in 1956 with utiyama @xcite even before the eps - framework had been set up in 1972 ) the first quantized wave function @xmath13 for matter entered the scene as an elementary and `` irreducible '' concept in gravity theory . when _",
    "interference in an external gravitational field was discovered experimentally in 1975 by collella , overhauser , and werner ( cow ) @xcite , see also @xcite , sec.7 , it was clear that the point particle concept in the eps - framework became untenable from a physical point of view . for completeness let us mention some more recent experiments on matter waves in the gravitational field or in a noninertial frame :    * the werner , staudenmann , and colella experiment @xcite in 1979 on the phase shift of neutron waves induced by the rotation of the earth ( sagnac - type effect ) , * the bonse & wroblewski experiment @xcite in 1984 on neutron interferometry in a noninertial frame ( verifying , together with the cow experiment , the equivalence principle for neutron waves ) , * the kasevich & chu interferometric experiment @xcite in 1991 with laser - cooled wave packets of sodium _ atoms _ in the gravitational field , * the mewes et al .",
    "experiment @xcite in 1997 with interfering freely falling bose - einstein condensed sodium atoms , see ketterle @xcite , fig.14 and the corresponding text , * the nesvizhevsky et al .",
    "experiment @xcite in 2002 on the quantum states of neutrons in the earth s gravitational field , and * the fray , hnsch , et al .",
    "@xcite experiment in 2004 with a matter wave interferometer based on the diffraction of atoms from effective absorption gratings of light .",
    "this interferometer was used for two stable isotopes of the rubidium atom in the gravitational field of the earth .",
    "thereby the equivalence principle was tested successfully on the atomic level .",
    "clearly , without the schrdinger equation in an external gravitational field or in a noninertial frame all these experiments can not be described . still , in most textbooks on gravity , these experiments are not even mentioned !    in the 1980 s , as a reaction to the cow - experiment , audretsch and lmmerzahl , for a review see @xcite , started to develop an axiomatic scheme for spacetime in which the point particle was substituted by a matter wave function and the light ray be a wave equation for electromagnetic disturbances . in this way",
    ", they could also include projective structures with an asymmetric connection ( i.e. , with torsion ) , which was excluded in the eps approach a priori .",
    "turning to the conformal structure , which is in the center of our interest here , lmmerzahl et al .",
    "@xcite , see also @xcite , reconsidered the audretsch - lmmerzahl scheme and derived the inhomogeneous maxwell equation from the following requirements : a well - posed cauchy problem , the superposition principle , a finite propagation speed , and the absence of birefringence in vacuum .",
    "the homogeneous maxwell equation they got by a suitable definition of the electromagnetic field strength . with a geometric optics approximation , compare our sec.[propagation ] , they recover the light ray in lowest order . and",
    "this is the message of this type of axiomatics : within the axiomatic system of audretsch and lmmerzahl et al . , the light ray , which is elementary in the eps - approach , can be derived from reasonable axioms about the propagation of electromagnetic disturbances . as with the substitution of the mass point by a matter wave ,",
    "this inquiry into the physical nature of the light ray and the corresponding reshaping of the eps - scheme seems to lead to a better understanding of the metric of spacetime . and",
    "this is exactly where our framework fits in : we also build up the maxwell equations in an axiomatic way and are even led to the signature of the metric , an achievement that needs still to be evaluated in all details .",
    "let us then summarize our findings : we outlined our axiomatic approach to electrodynamics and to the derivation of the light cone . in particular , with the help of a local and linear spacetime relation ,    * we found the skewon field @xmath228 ( 15 components ) and the axion field @xmath106 ( 1  component ) , * we found a _ quartic _",
    "fresnel wave surface for light propagation .",
    "* in the case of vanishing _ birefringence , _ the fresnel wave surface degenerates and we recovered the light cone ( determining 9 components of the metric tensor ) and , together with it , the conformal and causal structure of spacetime and the hodge star @xmath229 operator . * if additionally the dilaton @xmath220 ( 1 component ) is put to a constant , namely to the admittance of free space @xmath230 [ @xmath226 in si - units ] , and the axion @xmath106 removed , we recover the conventional maxwell - lorentz spacetime relation @xmath231 .",
    "thus , in our framework , the conformal part of the _ metric _ emerges from the local and linear spacetime relation as an _ electromagnetic construct . _ in this sense , the light cone is a derived concept .",
    "one of us is grateful to claus lmmerzahl and jrgen ehlers for the invitation to the potsdam seminar .",
