    "anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) were long thought of as `` soft '' x - ray sources , because their x - ray spectra below 10  kev were observed to be falling off sharply . _ integral _ and _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ observations of these objects , as well as of their close cousins , the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) , revealed that their spectra turn over in the 1020 kev range , such that in fact some axps are the hardest known sources in the sky in the hard x - ray band @xcite .",
    "here we define the `` soft '' x - ray band as 110  kev , and the `` hard '' x - ray band as 2080  kev .",
    "prior to the discovery of the hard x - ray emission , @xcite ( hereafter mw01 ) reported an apparent correlation between soft - band spectral hardness and spin - down rate @xmath0 , where @xmath4 is the spin frequency .",
    "this reported correlation has been used as the primary motivation for the `` twisted magnetosphere '' model for magnetars @xcite . in that model ,",
    "surface activity driven by the decay of the large internal magnetic field of the star results in a twisted dipolar morphology of the magnetosphere , with powerful currents emanating from the surface and subsequently returning to heat it . in this picture , the mw01 hardness/@xmath0 correlation is interpreted physically as a correlation between hardness and spin - down - inferred surface dipolar magnetic field @xmath1 , where the latter can be estimated via @xmath5  g , with @xmath6 the pulse period .",
    "the simple @xmath0/b connection exists because , for axps and sgrs , there is a far wider range in observed @xmath0 than observed @xmath4 . in the twisted magnetosphere model ,",
    "this correlation is a result of stronger currents , due to higher @xmath1 hence higher activity , resonantly upscattering seed thermal photons from the hot surface to form the non - thermal component .",
    "in addition to the apparent soft - band hardness/@xmath1 correlation reported by mw01 , support for this picture comes from observed correlations between soft - band spectral index and flux in individual variable sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , since all else being equal , higher fluxes are expected from larger twists , because of higher return currents .    in this _ letter _ , we revisit the correlation reported by mw01 in light of three main developments in the field since their work .",
    "first , several new sources have been discovered since 2001 and can be used to confirm the original claimed correlation , which was based on only seven objects .",
    "second , previously known sources have been observed in longer integrations with higher sensitivity instruments , allowing better determinations of their spectral parameters .",
    "third , since 2001 , it has been recognized that axps can exhibit great variability both in soft x - ray flux and spectrum , particularly during outbursts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , mw01 considered measured magnetar spectral parameters without concern for the objects outburst status at the time of measurement , thereby possibly using data from objects in very different spectral states .",
    "in addition , with the study of the hard - band emission from axps and sgrs well underway , there now exist enough data for correlations similar to that noted by mw01 to be considered . indeed @xcite noted qualitatively that in the hard band , axps are harder than sgrs , the reverse of what is seen in the soft band . here",
    "we consider this point in more detail , noting possible correlations between the hardness of the hard - band spectra of axps and sgrs and @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) , and between magnitude of spectral change from the soft to hard bands , and @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) .",
    "we characterize axp and sgr soft and hard x - ray spectra phenomenologically .",
    "although significant effort has been expended to do physically motivated broadband spectral modelling ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this work is still progressing , with no final word reached .",
    "moreover , our motivation here is to characterize all sources in a systematic and uniform way .",
    "hence we choose to parametrize soft - band spectra using the simple blackbody plus power - law model , with @xmath7 being the soft - band photon index ( defined as @xmath8 ) .",
    "similarly , we parameterize the hard - band spectrum by a power law of photon index @xmath9 ( defined as for @xmath7 ) .",
    "we recognize that this parameterization is flawed , both in the soft band where the true spectrum is likely to be better represented by a comptonized thermal model ( such as those currently under development ) as required in the twisted magnetosphere model , but also more dramatically in the mid - energy range where there is clearly spectral curvature .",
    "nevertheless the parameterization is convenient , used ubiquitously in the literature , and does a reasonable job of characterizing the soft and hard - band spectra currently available , given statistical uncertainties ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we further acknowledge that the spectra , both soft ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hard ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , are dependent on pulse phase , however here we consider only phase - averaged spectral parameters .    in table  1 , we summarize the results reported in the literature for all known non - transient magnetars for which there are such measurements . since mw01 , several new magnetars have been discovered , four of which have well measured spin and spectral parameters ( cxou  j010043.1@xmath2721134 , sgr  0526@xmath266 , 1e  1547.0@xmath25408 and cxo  j164710.2@xmath2455216 ) .",
    "in addition , in the soft x - ray band , sgrs and axps are now established to be highly variable , such that @xmath7 can vary greatly . in compiling table  1",
    ", we took great care to include the @xmath7 ( always for a blackbody plus power - law model ) for objects when their reported fluxes were at or near the lowest yet recorded .",
    "this was done to ensure the objects were in their quiescent state , with no temporary enhancement that could be interpreted as a magnetospheric twist with corresponding spectral hardening . by contrast",
    ", mw01 averaged together different published values of @xmath7 , presumably under the assumption that the values do not change , which we now know to be incorrect . in making our selections from the literature , where multiple quiescent spectral observations were available",
    ", we verified that the reported @xmath7 values were roughly consistent , then selected that with the smallest reported uncertainty .",
    "we excluded the so - called transient axp xte  j1810@xmath2197 which shows no clear non - thermal component when in quiescence @xcite .",
    "using the data provided in table 1 , we plot @xmath7 versus @xmath1 and @xmath0 in figure  [ fig : gammas ] .",
    "values of @xmath0 are long - term averages as recorded in the sgr / axp online catalogpulsar / magnetar / main.html ] ( see references for @xmath0 values therein ) .",
    "we note the previously seen trend for decreasing @xmath7 with increasing @xmath1 or @xmath0 . to quantify this trend , we determined pearson s linear correlation coefficient to be @xmath10 for a sample size of @xmath11 , corresponding to a null - hypothesis ( two - tailed ) probability of @xmath12 .",
    "we note that this @xmath13 value , as for all others in this paper , is actually an upper limit given that uncertainties are not accounted for in calculating @xmath14 .",
    "this @xmath7/@xmath0 trend is not as striking as it was in mw01 ( compare with their fig .",
    "2 ) ; there is more scatter vs. @xmath0 correlation ( their fig .",
    "2 ) , @xmath15 for @xmath16 , implying @xmath17 . ] . if we ignore axp 1e  1547.0@xmath25408 , whose @xmath7 has large uncertainty , the trend is improved and is significant with @xmath18% confidence ( @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) , though still with considerable scatter .",
    "interestingly , the plot of @xmath7 versus @xmath1 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gammas ] , left ) shows a better correlation ( @xmath22 for @xmath11 , @xmath23 ) , which may support the twisted magnetosphere model in that it is the magnitude of @xmath1 that determines the twist size , not just the spin - down rate .",
    "nevertheless , there is scatter ; this could imply that the value of @xmath1 , as inferred from spin - down parameters , is only a rough estimate of the true field strength , a possibility already generally recognized given the greatly simplified assumptions in computing @xmath1 , and also observationally suggested from the absence of anomalous x - ray emission from very high-@xmath1 rotation - powered pulsars ( e.g. pivavoroff , kaspi & camilo 2000 ; mclaughlin et al .",
    "2003 ; kaspi & mclaughlin 2005 ) .",
    "we also searched for a correlation between the simultaneously measured blackbody temperature @xmath24 and @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , but , like mw01 , found none .",
    "specifically , for @xmath11 , @xmath25 , implying @xmath26 , clearly non - excluding of the null hypothesis .",
    "this argues that the underlying physical parameter that is most closely linked with a magnetar s magnetic field is manifested in the power - law component , rather than in the thermal component ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure  [ fig : gammah ] shows values of @xmath9 plotted versus @xmath1 ( left ) and @xmath0 ( right ) for the six sources for which @xmath9 has presently been measured . in some cases , @xmath9 is for the pulsed emission , in other cases for the total emission , and in three cases for both ( see table 1 ) .",
    "there is a possible trend in the data .",
    "axps are harder in the 2080  kev band than are sgrs as qualitatively noted by @xcite . but as is clear here , even within the axp class itself , low @xmath1 or @xmath0 sources are harder than high @xmath1 or @xmath0 sources . to be more quantitative , for the sources for which the pulsed emission is measured , we find @xmath27 for @xmath28 , implying @xmath29 for a @xmath9 correlation with @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "3 , left ) , and @xmath31 for @xmath28 implying @xmath32 for the @xmath9 versus @xmath33 data ( fig .",
    "3 , right ) . these values are more significant for the total flux ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath30 and @xmath33 , respectively ) when the ( pulsed ) value for 1e  2259 + 586 is included , under the assumption that its total flux @xmath9 does not differ much from its pulsed @xmath9 , as for the three sources for which both are measured . although not quite significant at the @xmath18% confidence level , these possible correlations seem noteworthy .",
    "we note that the value of @xmath9 for 1e  2259 + 586 should be regarded with caution , the source having been detected only up to 30  kev thus far",
    ". this will hopefully improve with time .",
    "we also of course caution that the trend is defined by only six sources , one fewer than was used by mw01 .",
    "if this correlation is correct , then for axp  1e  1048.1@xmath25937 , the brightest axp for which @xmath9 has not yet been measured , @xmath9 should be @xmath301 .",
    "this may be testable with long integrations by _ integral _ , or by the future focussing hard x - ray mission _ nustar _",
    "( expected launch 2011 ) which should have point - source sensitivity of @xmath3100 times that of _ integral_.    note that in all but two cases ( 4u  0142 + 61 and sgr  1806@xmath220 ) , the sources were in quiescence at all epochs when the hard x - ray observations were done . for 4u  0142 + 61 ,",
    "the measured hard x - ray spectral parameters are an average over @xmath34  yr of data @xcite which included a few - month active period in 2006 @xcite .",
    "this active period seems unlikely to have biased the hard x - ray spectrum because of the absence of soft x - ray variability during that epoch @xcite , because of the relatively small duration of the hard x - ray exposure during the active period relative to during quiescence , as well as because of the absence of any evidence for hard x - ray flux or spectral variability over the 4 years of _ integral _ observations ( with flux and @xmath9 stable to within 17% ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for sgr 1806@xmath220 ,",
    "the hard x - ray observations were obtained roughly 2  yr after the source s giant flare of 2004 december . during the hard x - ray observations , the source was nearly back to quiesence , though still bursting occasionally .",
    "whether this mild activity affected its hard x - ray spectrum is unknown given that no variability has yet been reported in the hard x - ray spectrum of _ any _ magnetar .",
    "this will likely be difficult to determine with current hard x - ray telescopes given their sensitivity , barring another major outburst .",
    "figure  [ fig : turnover ] shows values of @xmath36 , our parameterization of the degree of spectral turnover , plotted versus @xmath1 ( left ) and @xmath0 ( right ) .",
    "a trend is suggested by both plots , such that the lowest @xmath1 or @xmath0 sources generally have the largest spectral turnover .",
    "quantitatively , for the pulsed data , we find @xmath37 for @xmath28 implying @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath28 implying @xmath17 , for @xmath36 versus @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively .",
    "when considering total flux , these values change to @xmath40 for @xmath41 implying @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath41 implying @xmath44 , for @xmath36 versus @xmath1 and @xmath0 , respectively , again including the ( pulsed ) data for 1e  2259 + 586 , under the reasonable assumption that the difference between its total and pulsed flux spectral turnovers is small ( as it is for the three sources for which both have been measured ) .",
    "thus , these correlations are significant at the @xmath45% level .",
    "if the @xmath9 versus @xmath1 trend holds and the above prediction for @xmath9 for 1e  1048.1@xmath25937 is correct , its spectral turnover would agree well with this second trend .",
    "the same obvious caution regarding the paucity of sources as in figure  [ fig : gammah ] , holds , however .",
    "we also investigated whether there exists any correlation between hard x - ray luminosity and @xmath1 , but found none .",
    "however , the luminosities of the sources in this band are generally poorly known , given relatively large @xmath9 and distance uncertainties .",
    "thus some correlation may exist , but can not presently be discerned .",
    "we have revisited the correlation between soft x - ray band power - law spectral index and @xmath0 and @xmath1 reported previously by mw01 , and find it continues to hold , though with significant scatter .",
    "this stands in contrast to the absence of any apparent relationship between blackbody temperature and @xmath1 or @xmath0 .",
    "this supports the foundation for the `` twisted magnetosphere '' model of @xcite , as further developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the significant scatter in the still small measured population suggests in the context of this model that the inferred @xmath1 is only a rough estimate of the stellar dipolar magnetic field , and/or that other factors , such as geometry ( both intrinsic and viewing ) and higher - order magnetic multipoles , play physically important roles .",
    "with very recent discoveries of several new magnetars , for example sgr 0501 + 4516 @xcite and sgr 0418 + 5729 @xcite , as well as new measurements of spin parameters for previously known objects , as , for example , for sgr 1627@xmath241 @xcite , it should be possible to further test the veracity of the correlation in the near future .",
    "the possible correlations we have noted for the hard - band emission from magnetars may be telling us something new about the magnetar emission process .",
    "next we consider whether the published models have predicted the observed trends .",
    "@xcite suggested that magnetohydrodynamic fast modes produced by magnetars may break down to form electron / positron pairs in the magnetosphere .",
    "they suggested that non - thermal radiation associated with this fast - mode breakdown could account for the high - energy emission from magnetars .",
    "however in this model , the spectrum of the radiation is fixed and is not expected to vary from source to source as has been observed .",
    "this difficulty , along with the now falsified @xcite prediction that the fast - mode breakdown radiation spectrum should extend above 1  mev , argues against this model being relevant to explain the observed properties of the hard x - ray emission in magnetars .",
    "@xcite explore resonant inverse compton upscattering of thermal emission from the surface , by relativistic electrons only a few stellar radii from the surface .",
    "this resonant scattering , at least in their preliminary analysis , is expected to yield a very flat spectrum , independent of @xmath1 , unlike what is reported here .",
    "however , @xcite did not consider non - resonant scattering which they suggest may have a very different spectrum , although its relative contribution is as yet unclear . for the resonant scattering , although substantial spectral differences are expected for different scattering locales , as well as for more complicated field geometries than the assumed dipole , the flatness of the spectrum independent of @xmath1 seems robust .",
    "the correlations we report thus suggest that this process is not the dominant mechanism for producing the hard x - ray emission in magnetars .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite argue that powerful magnetic currents in the magnetar magnetosphere are induced by sporadic starquakes that twist the external magnetic field .",
    "a self - induction electric field lifts particles from the surface , accelerates them , and yields avalanches of pair creation .",
    "this forms a corona close to the neutron star surface . @xcite and",
    "@xcite consider a model in which the hard x - rays are produced in the transition layer between the corona and thermal photosphere . in this model ,",
    "the hard x - ray emission is a result of thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature that scales approximately as @xmath46 , with @xmath47  kev for reasonable parameters .",
    "however , we verified , using spectral simulations , that this scaling predicts the opposite of the correlation seen in figure  [ fig : gammah ] , because higher @xmath24 , expected for higher @xmath1 , gets fit with a lower @xmath9 when fit with a simple power law , for @xmath24 in the range 20200  kev .",
    "thus the observed correlation does not seem consistent with a thermal bremsstrahlung origin .    on the other hand , the observed correlation between the spectral index change and @xmath1 could be interpreted at least qualitatively in the framework of models in which magnetospheric currents play a role in the production of the high - energy emission as follows . in the magnetosphere , relativistic electrons can resonantly scatter surface thermal photons to form the non - thermal portion of the soft - band spectrum as discussed first by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , electrons that do not have a chance to scatter will impact on the surface , heating it , and possibly creating a corona as described by @xcite and further explored by @xcite ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for higher @xmath1 sources , the scattering optical depth increases , rendering the soft index harder as described by @xcite , but leaving fewer electrons for heating the corona , and hence possibly resulting in the hard index being softer .    for energetic rotation - powered pulsars ( rpps ) ,",
    "the power - law spectrum seen below 10  kev extends well beyond that energy , such that the spectral turnover @xmath48 for practically all sources for which it has been measured . in a handful of cases , there is marginal evidence for a subtle change of shape of the hard spectrum , generally parameterized as a log - parabolic steepening above @xmath49  kev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly if the trend in figure  [ fig : turnover ] held for rpps",
    ", one would expect huge turnovers , given their far lower @xmath1 .",
    "this argues strongly that the mechanism for the production of hard x - rays in magnetars is different in rpps , which was already suggested by the fact that the magnetar hard x - ray emission has luminosity far in excess of that available from rotational slow - down , in contrast to that from rpps .",
    "@xmath9 for the usually rotation - powered psr  j1846@xmath20258 ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the highest-@xmath1 ( @xmath50  g ) rpp for which @xmath9 has been measured @xcite , is 1.2 , much larger than would be predicted by the trend in figure  3 , left ( @xmath9 versus @xmath1 ) but smaller than what would be predicted in figure  3 , right ( @xmath9 versus @xmath0 ) .",
    "indeed the same is true of practically all rpps for which @xmath9 has been measured , further demonstrating a different hard - x - ray production mechanism .",
