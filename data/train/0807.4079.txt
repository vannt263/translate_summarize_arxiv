    "recent progress in the statistical mechanics of non - equilibrium systems centered around fluctuation @xcite and work @xcite theorems has profound implications for both theory and applications .",
    "rather complementary to the traditional emphasis of statistical mechanics on _ typical _ behaviour of systems these new lines of research put the _ large deviation _ properties of thermodynamic variables like work or entropy into focus . of particular interest for many practical applications is the use of the jarzynski equation @xcite @xmath0 to determine the free energy difference @xmath1 between two equilibrium states at inverse temperature @xmath2 from the work distribution @xmath3 characterizing irreversible transitions between these states .",
    "the method works best if @xmath4 is of the order of the thermal energy , @xmath5 .",
    "detailed knowledge of free energy differences in mesoscopic systems is of crucial importance for problems like the conformations of polymers , the decay of metastable states , or the efficiency of molecular motors .",
    "it is very remarkable and particularly attractive for systems with long relaxation times that equilibrium information like @xmath1 may be obtained from fast changes of state .",
    "the method has been successfully employed in experiments on mesoscopic systems @xcite as well as in numerical simulations @xcite where , however , its superiority to other methods is still under debate @xcite .",
    "the main problems arise from the exponential average in ( [ eq : je ] ) which is dominated by small values of @xmath6 from the tail of the distribution @xmath3 .",
    "since these large deviations are rarely sampled the resulting free energy estimate may be poor .",
    "an equivalent observation is @xcite that the _ dominant _ trajectories contributing most to the average in the r.h.s of ( [ eq : je ] ) are in general rather different from the _ typical _ ones , i.e. from those with the highest probability .",
    "several methods have been put forward to improve the accuracy of free energy estimates by , e.g. , including information from the backward process @xcite , using mappings and auxiliary drifts @xcite , or implementing biased path ensembles @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we devise a method to analytically determine the asymptotics of the work distribution @xmath3 of driven langevin systems for very small or large values of @xmath6 .",
    "we demonstrate that fitting these asymptotics to the region of work values that is still sufficiently sampled by experiment or simulation significantly improved estimates of the free energy difference may be obtained .",
    "the procedure builds on the method of optimal fluctuation which rests on the general assumption of large deviation theory @xcite that the probability of an unlikely event is dominated by the most probable fluctuation giving rise to it .",
    "all other possibilities to bring the same result about are even more unlikely and may be safely neglected . in physical context",
    "the method was originally proposed to determine the asymptotic tail of the electronic density of states in random potentials @xcite .",
    "later applications include the motion of charge density waves in disordered media @xcite , the velocity distribution in burgers turbulence @xcite , anomalous optical absorption in disordered semiconductors @xcite , and the free energy distribution of a directed polymer in a random medium @xcite .",
    "recently there have also been applications to optimal control theory @xcite and error correcting codes @xcite . in the present example of langevin dynamics",
    "the method corresponds to a saddle - point approximation in a functional integral over stochastic trajectories .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we outline the general theory .",
    "first the optimal path for a work value in the tail of @xmath3 is determined by the solution of a variational problem , then the contribution from neighbouring paths is included .",
    "section 3 concerns the discussion of three concrete examples .",
    "for the first the complete @xmath3 can be determined analytically so it serves merely as a test of our method . in the second we compare our results with numerical simulations of the langevin equation whereas the third uses experimental data .",
    "finally , section 4 contains some conclusions .",
    "for concreteness we consider a system with overdamped langevin dynamics described by @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the degrees of freedom , @xmath9 is a potential giving rise to a deterministic drift , and @xmath10 is a standard gaussian white noise source obeying @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "we denote derivatives with respect to @xmath8 by a prime and those with respect to @xmath13 by a dot .    during the time interval",
    "@xmath14 $ ] the potential changes between @xmath15 and @xmath16 according to a fixed protocol . using prepoint discretization",
    "the probability density functional of trajectories starting at @xmath17 at @xmath18 and ending at @xmath19 at @xmath20 is up to a constant given by @xmath21\\sim\\exp\\big (        -\\beta\\int_0^{t_1 } \\!\\ !",

    "formally this corresponds to considering the weak noise limit @xmath30 .",
    "the determination of the optimal trajectory in ( [ eq : pofw ] ) includes the optimal choice of its initial and final point @xcite .",

    "becomes the more accurate the larger @xmath2 is or , equivalently , the more @xmath6 lies in the tail of @xmath3 .",
    "although ( [ eq : asym1 ] ) gives a correct estimate of the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath3 it is often desireable to improve its accuracy by incorporating the dominant pre - exponential factor .",
    "this factor has contributions from trajectories in the neighbourhood of the optimal one and also accounts for the jacobian accompanying the transition from @xmath38 $ ] to @xmath3 .",
    "it is determined by including the quadratic fluctuations around the saddle - point into the calculation .",
    "this can be accomplished by adopting the gelfand - yaglom method @xcite which yields an ordinary differential equation for the fluctuation determinant to the present problem .",
    "two points are different from the standard case .",
    "first , the free endpoints of the optimal trajectory contribute to the gaussian fluctuations and give rise to modified boundary conditions for the fluctuation determinant .",
    "second , the constraint @xmath39=w$ ] suppresses some fluctuations and gives rise to a correction factor to the free fluctuation determinant .",
    "some details of the explicit calculation necessary to incorporate these two modifications are given in the appendix .",
    "using @xmath40,\\ , \\bar{v}=v({\\bar{x}}(t),t)$ ] and similarly for derivatives of @xmath9 the final result for the asymptotics of the work distribution is @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the solution of the initial value problem @xmath43q\\\\    q&(t=0)=1\\qquad \\dot{q}(t=0)=0 \\label{eq : resq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath44 is given by @xmath45^{-1 }      { \\dot{v}}'({\\bar{x}}(t'),t')\\ , .\\ ] ]",
    "as a first example we consider a brownian particle dragged in a parabolic potential , i.e. @xmath46 this system has been been analyzed thoroughly both from the theoretical @xcite as well as from the experimental side @xcite .",
    "the distribution @xmath3 is known to be gaussian @xcite @xmath47 with @xmath48 since in this example the complete distribution @xmath3 is known exactly it merely serves as a test of our method .",
    "the ele ( [ eq : ele ] ) is for ( [ eq : defv1 ] ) linear and can be solved analytically with the result @xmath49 this yields @xmath50=\\frac{(w-(t_1+e^{-t_1}-1))^2 }           { 4(t_1+e^{-t_1}-1 ) } \\label{eq : hores}\\ ] ] which correctly reproduces the exponential factor in ( [ eq : pexact ] ) .",
