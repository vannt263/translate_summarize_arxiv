    "hercules x-1 ( discovered by tananbaum et al . 1972 ) is one of the most frequently observed x - ray binary systems .",
    "the intermediate mass of the donor star , @xmath5  m@xmath6 , leads to a wealth of behavior seen in both low mass and high mass systems .",
    "although we suspect the mass flow is primarily through roche lobe overflow giving rise to an accretion disk , as in the low mass x - ray binaries ( lmxb ) , the variable p  cygni profiles observed in uv lines suggest either a transient stellar wind or a stellar wind that is photoionized in some regions ( boroson , kallman , &  vrtilek 2001 ) .",
    "there are theoretical grounds as well to expect that winds may arise in this system when x - rays from the neutron star heat the surface of the normal star or accretion disk ( arons 1973 ; davidson &  ostriker 1973 ; basko et al .",
    "1977 ; london , mccray , &  auer 1981 ; begelman , mckee , & shields 1983 ; begelman &  mckee 1983 ) .",
    "most lmxbs , including z - sources and atoll - sources , do not show persistent pulsations , perhaps because they have neutron stars with low magnetic fields .",
    "these sources thus lack an essential window into their kinematics .",
    "light travel - time delays in the 1.24  second her  x-1 x - ray pulsation period determine that the neutron star is in a nearly circular 1.7  day orbit with semimajor axis a@xmath7  seconds .",
    "the orbital period is slowly lengthening from mass loss in the system ( deeter et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "fortuitously , her  x-1 has high orbital inclination ( @xmath8 degrees ) , allowing total x - ray eclipses to constrain the size of the donor star , and the high galactic latitude offers only small reddening , allowing the system to be observed at crucial uv and even euv wavelengths .",
    "the system s most mysterious variability is the 35-day x - ray high and low cycle ( giacconi et al .",
    "1973 ) . for 811 days ( the `` main - on state '' ) of this cycle",
    "her  x-1 emits x - rays with a @xmath9 erg  s@xmath10 total x - ray luminosity . for a @xmath11 day cycle ( the `` short - on state '' ) ,",
    "halfway through the 35 day cycle , her  x-1 s output is several times lower . for the remaining portion of the 35 days , the off state ,",
    "the observed x - ray flux is only several percent of that during the main - on state .",
    "the behavior of the optical flux and x - ray spectrum over the 35-day period shows that the 35-day variability is not isotropic . instead",
    ", the x - ray emission is merely obscured by a warped accretion disk whose shape  precesses \" globally throughout a 35-day period .",
    "the optical emission from the normal star varies with the 1.7  day binary orbit .",
    "its spectral type is variously classified as a through f , because x - rays from the neutron star heat the surface of the facing side of the roche lobe .",
    "the spectral type continues to change with the orbital period throughout the longer 35-day cycle , implying that x - rays continue to heat the surface of hz  her .",
    "the transition between the off and main - on state is only a few hours , whereas the short - on state is entered into more gradually .",
    "this indicates that regions of the disk at different radii may obscure the central source , in which case the disk must precess globally with the same period . the variation in pulse shape with the long - term period is sometimes taken to imply that the innermost edge of the accretion disk precesses with the 35 day period , obscuring local regions on the neutron star ( scott , leahy , &  wilson , 2000 ) .",
    "the physical cause of a 35-day global disk precessing disk warp , or a definitive relation between system parameters and disk precession period , remains unknown and is a major goal of investigations of the system .",
    "it has been proposed , but not confirmed , that reprocessed x - ray radiation pressure ( maloney &  begelman 1997 ; wijers &  pringle 1999 ) or an x - ray driven disk wind and corona ( meyer , meyer - hofmeister , 1984 ) could propagate the warped shape in the disk .",
    "similar \" long - term periods  have been observed in other x - ray binaries , including lmc  x-4 .",
    "her  x-1 serves as a prototype of this behavior .",
    "x - ray dips present another variability that has not been explained definitively .",
    "crosa &  boynton ( 1980 ) showed that the dips recur every 1.65 days , near , but not at , the 1.62  day beat period between orbital and precessional periods .",
    "this was confirmed by long - term x - ray observations ( scott &  leahy , 1999 ) .",
    "the dips are thought to be associated with the gas stream between the stars , but there is no consensus explanation for them or their period .    as befits such a frequently observed , enigmatic , yet prototypical source ,",
    "the methods of spectroscopy have been applied to the system at a wide range of wavelengths .",
    "these studies have borne fruit with determinations of the system s elemental abundances and the orbital motion of the normal star ( the neutron star s pulse delays indicate only the motion of one component of the binary ) .",
    "high resolution spectroscopy in the x - ray range using _ xmm _ ( jimenez - garate et al . 2002 ) shows a multitude of x - ray emission lines presumably from an accretion disk corona .",
    "the line ratios indicate that the gas is enhanced from cno processing from a massive progenitor .",
    "jimenez - garate et al .",
    "( 2005 ) confirmed the cno enhancement by observations of more than two dozen emission lines originating in an accretion disk corona .",
    "model predictions of the disk corona s response to illumination by the central x - ray source are in reasonable agreement with the observed fluxes for low and moderate z elements ( o through s ) , but the fexxv , fexxvi lines are several times brighter than predicted ( jimenez - garate et al .",
    "2005 ) .    from observations of optical absorption lines ( reynolds et al .",
    "1997 ) , and from optical pulsations that result from the x - rays from the neutron star periodically striking the surface of the normal star ( middleditch &   nelson 1976 ) , we know that the normal star has a mass @xmath12  m@xmath6 and the neutron star has a mass 1.5@xmath13  m@xmath6 .",
    "the optical spectrum shows absorption lines from hz  her , emission at the bowen blend near 4640  ( see schachter , filippenko , &  kahn 1989 for a discussion of the formation of these lines ) , and emission from heii@xmath14 .",
    "still et al . (",
    "1997 ) performed doppler tomography on these optical emission lines but could not conclude that they arose in a symmetric accretion disk .",
    "the uv spectrum is crucial for an understanding of the accretion disk and the x - ray illuminated face of hz  her .",
    "the continuum emission from both the illuminated star and the disk peaks in the uv and the disk contributes a greater fraction than at optical wavelengths ( cheng , vrtilek , &  raymond 1995 ) . from models of the variable uv continuum",
    "as observed with the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ , vrtilek &  cheng 1996 ) showed that a change in the accretion disk precession could explain an anomalously low period of x - ray emission .    to study global accretion one should observe gas at ionization stages and temperatures resulting from x - ray illumination of the disk , and one would need to resolve doppler - shifted velocities that correspond to the orbital motion of the neutron star ( 160 km  s@xmath10 ) , motion in the accretion disk ( expected to be @xmath15  km  s@xmath10 at the edge of the disk ) , and the velocities expected in a disk or stellar wind ( @xmath16  km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "the strong uv resonance lines from nv , siiv , and civ , first seen with _ iue _ ( howarth &  wilson 1983b ) , presumably result from photoionization of the accretion disk and hz  her ( raymond 1993 , ko &  kallman 1994 ) .",
    "these lines are much stronger than the strongest optical high ionization line , heii@xmath14 , both in absolute flux and equivalent width .",
    "observations with the faint object spectrograph ( fos ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ ) showed that these lines are still present at a few percent of maximum brightness during mid - eclipse when the disk and heated star should be entirely obscured ( anderson et al .",
    "the source of this emission may be an expanding wind .",
    "the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on _ hst _ first resolved these emission lines at @xmath17  km  s@xmath10 resolution ( boroson et al . , 1996 ) to discern variable broad and narrow emission components .",
    "the _ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) confirmed that the resonance lines have at least two components ( vrtilek et al .",
    "a broad component arises on the accretion disk while a narrow line component may be associated with hz  her .",
    "prior to the stis observations , the accretion disk had only been observed as it contributed to the continuum light curve or obscured the central x - rays . during eclipse ingress and egress ,",
    "the broad lines seen with stis behaved as expected for lines from an accretion disk rotating prograde with the orbital direction .",
    "the blue edge of the line was obscured first in eclipse ingress and appeared first in egress .",
    "observations with the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( _ fuse _ ) are complementary to the existing _ hst _ observations .",
    "long - term variability in the system makes it impossible to combine rigorously data from different epochs .",
    "analyzed separately , however , the _ fuse _ wavelength range of 900 - 1200  offers similar advantages and powerful consistency checks to analysis of the _ hst _ bandpass of 1200 - 1700 .",
    "both wavelength ranges have strong resonance lines that respond to x - ray photoionization .",
    "observations with the hopkins ultraviolet telescope ( _ hut _ ) showed that the ovi doublet has flux comparable to the nv doublet , the brightest near uv line ( boroson et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the resonance line doublets offer optical depth information through their doublet ratios , but if the lines are as broad as the doublet separation , it may be impossible to determine the individual contribution of each line where they overlap .",
    "the separations of civ@xmath18 , siiv@xmath19 , nv@xmath20 , ovi@xmath21 , svi@xmath22 correspond to doppler shifts of 500 , 1900 , 960 , 1650 , 3600 km  s@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "the far uv lines ovi and svi compare favorably with the near uv lines ( i.e. have greater separation and are less likely to overlap ) , except for siiv , which suffers from confusion with an oiv blend near 1400 .",
    "for the present observations , we observed an entire 1.7  day binary orbit with _",
    "fuse_. a major goal of this program was to apply the method of doppler tomography (  7 ) , which has the advantage of diagnosing the accretion flow of different systems without bringing to bear more than a few assumptions .",

    "with _ fuse _ ( the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ) we extend observations in the uv spectral range to 900 - 1190 , a range observed only once before using _ hut _ , the hopkins ultraviolet telescope aboard the astro-1 , carried aboard the space shuttle but not placed in orbit ( boroson et al .",

    "r@xmath25 fuse approaches _ hst _ in its utility for our program ; the time coverage of the _ hst _ space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) was limited because the detectors were turned off when the spacecraft passed through the south atlantic anomaly .",

    "the exposure times listed in table  2 are in most cases equal to the raw observation time . however , for cases such as observation 13 , interrupted by a passage through the south atlantic anomaly and not occultation by the earth , the exptime listed is in general the minimum good exposure time for any _ fuse _ detector .",
    "the data were obtained through the lwrs aperature and in timetag mode .",
    "we used the calfuse pipeline software version 3.0.8 to extract and calibrate the data from all four _ fuse _ telescopes .",
    "below 1100 , where emission features are sharp , we added an offset to each wavelength scale , in intervals of 0.025 , so that the absorption and emission features from each detector best agreed .",

    "( for example , the change in a spectrum must not be caused by a bright spot being obscured by an opaque object . ) even outside of the conditions in which it strictly applies , however , tomographic images can provide a common view of the data and may suggest directions for further analysis .    technically , a doppler tomogram is an inversion of    @xmath94    which gives the flux @xmath95 at the projected velocity @xmath96 and the orbital phase @xmath97 as a summation of the velocity space tomogram @xmath98 with a line broadening function @xmath99 which is usually narrow .",
    "this integral is an instance of a radon transform .",
    "the line broadening function for our fuse spectra is approximately 0.05and for tomographic analysis we assume it is a delta function .",

    "the formation of the spectrum from the tomogram can be thought of as follows .",
    "the phase @xmath97 determines a direction in the velocity space plane , and moving along that line , summing the intensity perpendicular to the line , one ideally forms the spectral line . at @xmath103 , one views from the right in our figures , at @xmath35 one views from the bottom , and at @xmath33 one views from the left .    in this paper",

    "although it may seem as if this filtering complicates the method of back - projection , a ramp filter ( multiplying the fourier transform by the frequency ) is required in order for back projection to produce a rigorous inversion of equation  [ eq : tomogram ] . otherwise , back projection would only produce a smeared version of the true tomogram .",
    "unfortunately , using a ramp filter also magnifies pixel to pixel noise .",
    "we apply a standard wiener filter that assumes a signal amid a noise component that is constant with frequency .",
    "we find the power spectrum of the line spectra is well fit by several components of the form @xmath107 ( with @xmath108 ) .",
    "the contribution of the signal is negligible at high frequencies @xmath109 , where the power spectrum is fit well by a constant noise level @xmath110 .",
    "the action of the wiener filter is then to multiply the power spectrum by @xmath111 , which is nearly 1 when the signal dominates the noise and negligible at high frequencies where the spectrum is almost entirely noise .",
    "we used the same form of @xmath112 for each line at each orbital phase , and made a visual comparison between the actual power spectrum and the function @xmath112 . because the filter adapts to different noise levels , the amount of smoothing varies from line to line .",
    "for the lines with highest s / n , such as ovi@xmath93 , the turnover frequency for the smoothing filter is on the order of 3 pixels , whereas for weaker lines such as svi@xmath113 , the smoothing is on the order of 10 pixels .",

    "the signal in the tomograms , except as noted above , is concentrated in a peak offset from the roche lobe of hz  her . the traditional signature of an accretion disk is not obviously present .",
    "accretion disks are expected to cause broad line emission that appears as a ring in a tomogram , with diminished flux within the velocity at the edge of the accretion disk , or about 300  km  s@xmath10 for hercules  x-1 .",

    ", the viewer looks at the system from the bottom of the plot , stacking pixels vertically .",
    "the result is red - shifted emission ( the bright spot ) and blue - shifted absorption ( the dark spot ) .",
    "although the blue - shifted absorption at @xmath122 may be explained through the analogy of p  cygni lines , the red - shifted emission at these phases does not fit this explanation . in a p",
    "cygni line , except when a very hot wind is present ( as in a wolf - rayet star ) , all the emission is caused by spherically symmetric scattering , so that conservation of photons requires that the forward - scattered flux be nearly equal to the back - scattered ( `` absorbed '' ) flux ( some portion of the forward - scattered emission is blocked by the star itself ) . in contrast , any blue - shifted absorption in the her  x-1 spectrum is only a small fraction of the emission .",
    "further , p  cygni emission is only red - shifted because it overlaps with the absorption on the blue end ; the actual emission spectrum should be symmetric about zero velocity .",
    "it seems most natural to associate the bright spot with the x - ray heated face of the normal star , as it follows roughly the same light curve and appears near the star and far from the disk on the tomograms .",
