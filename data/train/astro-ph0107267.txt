    "studies with hst have revealed a variety of structures in the nuclei of nearby elliptical galaxies : stellar and/or gaseous disks , massive central black holes , unresolved nuclear spikes , and kinematically decoupled structures .",
    "progress towards a better understanding of the properties of nearby galaxies requires a systematic investigation of the large - scale ( ground - based ) kinematics and line - strengths of a representative sample .",
    "traditionally such studies relied on long - slit spectroscopy along at most a few position angles , but this is insufficient to unravel the rich internal kinematics of spheroids .",
    "for this reason we built the panoramic integral - field spectrograph sauron for the william herschel telescope.=-2    the design of sauron is similar to that of the prototype integral - field spectrograph tiger and its successor oasis built for the cfht ( bacon et al .",
    "1995 , 2000 ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath1 with spatial sampling of @xmath2 .",
    "sauron provides 1577 spectra in the wavelength range from 4810 to 5350 .",
    "of these , 146 are sky spectra @xmath3 away from the main field . a complete description of the design and construction of sauron , and the corresponding data reduction software is given in bacon et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "we are carrying out a systematic study of nearby cluster and field e , s0 and sa galaxies .",
    "the aim is to determine the intrinsic shapes of the galaxies , their orbital structure , the mass - to - light ratio as a function of radius , the age and metallicity of the stellar components , the dynamical role of decoupled cores and nuclear black holes , the relation between the stellar ( and gaseous ) kinematics , and the star formation history .",
    "here we illustrate the variety of gas morphologies and kinematics displayed by nearby spheroids by presenting sauron maps of the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] emission - line gas for one elliptical and one spiral galaxy of our sample , ngc 5813 and ngc 7742 , respectively.=-2",
    "ngc 5813 is an e1 - 2 galaxy located in the virgo - libra cloud ( tully 1988 ) with absolute magnitude @xmath4 .",
    "it contains a weak unresolved radio continuum source ( birkinshaw & davies 1985 ; krajnovic & jaffe , in prep . ) .",
    "it has typical liner emission - line ratios , but no x - ray emission ( ho , filippenko & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "hst imaging shows dust filaments inside the kinematically decoupled core ( carollo et al .",
    "ground - based h@xmath5+[nii ] narrow - band imaging reveals an elongated ionized gas distribution ( caon et al.2000).=-2    we observed ngc 5813 on march 29 and 30 and april 4 , 2000 .",
    "the seeing was 1  on the first two nights and @xmath6 on the last .",
    "figure 1 shows the total intensity of the [ oiii ] emission , together with a comparison of the sauron data and the caon et al.(2000 ) long - slit data along two position angles . the map is a mosaic obtained by merging two sauron pointings which overlap on the nucleus .",
    "the morphology of the [ oiii ] emission exhibits complex filamentary structure , most likely not yet in equilibrium with the potential of the central region , despite the relatively short crossing time of @xmath710@xmath8  yr .",
    "this is confirmed by the disorganized sauron velocity field ( see also de zeeuw et al .",
    "ngc 7742 is a nearly face - on spiral galaxy classified as s(r)b in the rc3 ( @xmath4 ) , and it is an example of the latest spirals included in our sample .",
    "the galaxy contains an inner stellar ring with bright hii regions , flocculent spiral arms , a significant amount of neutral hydrogen , molecular gas , and dust ( de vaucouleurs & buta 1980 ; roberts et al .",
    "1991 ; wozniak et al .",
    "the nucleus is classified as a transition liner / hii object ( ho et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "figure 2 displays sauron maps based on a single pointing taken on october 13 , 1999 , with a seeing of @xmath9 .",
    "most of the h@xmath0 and [ oiii ] emission is confined to the ring of star formation surrounding the bulge .",
    "is dominant everywhere in the ring , and the ratio [ oiii]/h@xmath0 ranges from 0.06 to 0.14 . in the center",
    "the ratio is larger than 20 .",
    "figure 2 also shows a colour - coded sauron reconstructed image and a similar image based on wfpc2 exposures . the sauron map does not have the spatial resolution of hst , but it does demonstrate that our analysis technique is capable of providing accurate emission - line maps.=-2    the bottom panels of figure 2 display the mean velocity and velocity dispersion fields of the gas and the stars in ngc 7742 . the galaxy is observed close to face - on , and the amplitude of the velocities is accordingly modest",
    "the zero - velocity directions are well - defined , and their position angles are consistent with each other ( pa=@xmath10 for the stars and pa=@xmath11 for the gas ) .",
    "however , the gas and stars rotate in opposite sense .",
    "this suggests a merger or an accretion event in the history of the galaxy .",
    "we built sauron to efficiently measure the stellar and gaseous kinematics and linestrength distributions of early - type galaxies .",
    "the two examples shown here illustrate sauron s ability to measure the two - dimensional emission - line distributions .",
    "the results presented in de zeeuw et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that early - type galaxies display a diversity of line - strength distributions and kinematical structures much richer than previously assumed .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy is a mature technique , superior to long - slit studies because of the fundamental advantage of complete spatial coverage .",
    "the detailed sauron maps , together with high spatial resolution data from oasis and hst , will be used for modeling of the dynamics by means of schwarzschild s ( 1979 ) orbit superposition method . when combined with the constraints on the stellar populations derived from the line - strength distributions this",
    "will provide much needed insight into the fundamental properties of early - type galaxies and bulges ."
