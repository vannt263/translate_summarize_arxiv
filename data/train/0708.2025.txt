    "perovskite manganites with the general composition @xmath12mno@xmath13 ( @xmath14 : rare earth , @xmath15 : alkali elements ) have been intensively studied in the last decade since the discovery of the colossal magneto - resistance ( cmr ) phenomenon in la@xmath16ba@xmath17mno@xmath13 thin films @xcite .",
    "manganite materials are interesting not only for fundamental researches , but also for practical applications . along with sophisticated measurement and sample preparation techniques ,",
    "chemical substitution has been widely used as a convenient method to uncover the underlying physics and to search for compositions with novel properties .",
    "results for both @xmath14- and mn - site substitution have been quite well documented in the literature .",
    "magnetic and transport properties of manganites have been found to be systematically influenced by the average ionic size and the size mismatch of the ions occupying @xmath14-site @xcite .",
    "however , substitution at mn - site would lead to a mixture of effects caused by changes such as of crystal structure , charge carrier concentration , and more importantly the interaction between mn and the substitutional ion .",
    "despite many attempts at modifying the magnetic lattice of mn ions by direct substitution at the mn - site , no universal features have been revealed to date . in this paper , we report that the reduction of the ferromagnetic ( fm ) ordering transition temperature @xmath3 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18__m__@xmath19o@xmath13 ( _ _ m__@xmath20 = al , ti ) scales with the relative substitution concentration and is consistent with a prediction from molecular - field theory ( mft ) .",
    "the substitution with al or ti is selective in nature because al@xmath21 would only substitute for mn@xmath21 and ti@xmath22 for mn@xmath22 . besides ,",
    "because al@xmath21 and ti@xmath22 ions do not carry a magnetic moment , they are expected not to participate in any magnetic interaction .",
    "the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18__m__@xmath19o@xmath13 ( @xmath23 for _ _ m__@xmath24 al and @xmath25 for _ _ m__@xmath24 ti ) samples were prepared by a conventional solid state reaction method . raw powders with appropriate amounts of high purity la@xmath26o@xmath13 , srco@xmath13 , mno@xmath26 , al@xmath26o@xmath13 , and tio@xmath26 are thoroughly ground , mixed , pelletized , and then calcined at several processing steps at temperatures increased from 900 @xmath27c to 1200 @xmath27c with intermediate grindings and pelletizations .",
    "the products are then sintered at 1370 @xmath27c for 48 h in ambient atmosphere followed by a very slow cooling process from the sintering to room temperature with an annealing step at 700 @xmath27c for a few hours .",
    "room - temperature x - ray diffraction patterns ( measured using a siemens - d5000 with cu - k@xmath28 radiation ) presented in fig . [ fig.1 ] show that all of the obtained samples are essentially single phase with perovskite rhombohedral ( space group @xmath29 ) structures , in agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "redox titration experiments ( using k@xmath26cr@xmath26o@xmath30 titrant and c@xmath31h@xmath32ban@xmath26o@xmath33s@xmath26 as the colorimetric indicator ) for checking the oxygen content , @xmath34 , indicate that the samples are stoichiometric without any significant oxygen excess or deficiency .",
    "magnetic measurements were performed in a quantum design mpms - xl squid magnetometer .",
    "sr@xmath1mn@xmath35o@xmath13 ( @xmath36 al : upper panel , @xmath10 ti : lower panel ) . ]",
    "there have been concerns in several previous studies @xcite that al@xmath21 could replace mn@xmath22 , causing oxygen deficiency in al - doped manganites . however , our redox titration experiments carried out for the al - substituted samples show that , except for the @xmath37 and @xmath38 samples that have slight oxygen excesses , the oxygen deficiency is negligibly small ( @xmath39 ) and varies randomly with the substitution .",
    "ti is generally believed to be tetravalent when doped in manganites .",
    "both ti@xmath22 and mn@xmath22 are not jahn - teller active in the octahedral crystalline electric field .",
    "@xcite reported that ti@xmath22 replaces mn@xmath22 to form ti@xmath22o@xmath33 octahedra which are , as same as mn@xmath22o@xmath33 octahedra , not jahn - teller distorted , as evidenced in the infrared transmission spectra of the la@xmath0ca@xmath1mn@xmath18ti@xmath40o@xmath13 compounds .",
    "alternatively , analyzes on the x - ray diffraction spectra of our la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18__m__@xmath19o@xmath13 samples show that , as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , the unit cell volume monotonically decreases with al substitution while it increases with increasing ti concentration .",
    "these structural evolutions clearly evidence a selective substitution of al@xmath21 and ti@xmath22 for mn@xmath21 and mn@xmath22 , respectively , considering the fact that the ionic radius of al@xmath21 ( 0.535  ) is smaller than that of mn@xmath21 ( 0.645  ) and ti@xmath22 ( 0.605  ) is larger than mn@xmath22 ( 0.530  ) @xcite .",
    "as expected , the saturation magnetization , @xmath4 , measured at @xmath41 k and in an applied field up to @xmath42 t ( not shown ) decreases with increasing substitution concentration in both al- and ti - substitution series . in the high - field regime ( @xmath43 t ) , the @xmath44 curves are quite linear with a slope that develops with the substitution . for most cases , @xmath4 ,",
    "determined either at @xmath42 t or by extrapolating the high - field linear portion of the @xmath44 curves to @xmath45 , does not reach and even further deviates from the theoretical value with increasing @xmath46 .",
    "these observations suggest that , along with the major fm phase established by double exchange ( de ) @xcite , there exists a non - fm phase that develops with the substitution at the expense of the fm phase .",
    "since the mn@xmath21/mn@xmath22 ionic concentration ratio is driven off the optimal value of 7/3 , a certain amount of the mn ions may become redundant with respect to the de couplings .",
    "that implies that the selective substitution on one mn ionic species produces a redundancy on the other mn species and those redundant ions contribute to the non - fm phase .     and ti@xmath22 for mn@xmath21 and mn@xmath22 , respectively . ]",
    "temperature - dependent magnetization , @xmath47 , measurements show that the substitution of al or ti for mn causes @xmath3 to drop drastically ( see the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] below ) .",
    "there have been several explanations for the reduction of @xmath3 in other similar cases @xcite .",
    "one explanation is simply that this is due to the suppression of long - range fm order of the localized @xmath48 spins by local breakdown of the exchange couplings where the substitution occurs @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite assumed a demolition of the de mn@xmath21-o@xmath49-mn@xmath22 bonds and a lower hole - carrier concentration caused by ti substitution .",
    "_ @xcite suggested that the presence of ti favors the superexchange ( se ) interaction and suppresses the de mechanism .",
    "it has been also quite common to use the empirical formula of electron bandwidth @xcite , @xmath50}{d^{3.5}_{\\langle \\mathrm{mn - o}\\rangle } } , \\label{eqn1}\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 denote the average mn - o - mn bond angle and mn - o bond length , respectively , to discuss the magnetic and transport properties of manganites @xcite .",
    "_ @xcite found that ti substitution in la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18ti@xmath40o@xmath13 increases the mn - o - mn bond length and reduces the bond angle . based on structural data , the authors calculated the variation of @xmath53 , finding a decrease of @xmath53 with @xmath46 , and related it to the decrease of @xmath3 . despite this consistence between @xmath53 and @xmath3 found for the ti - substituted samples , taking into account the ionic size differences and considering the opposite evolutions of crystalline structure presented in fig .",
    "[ fig.2 ] , we proposed that the variation of @xmath53 may not be consistent with the decrease of @xmath3 in the case when mn is substituted by al .",
    "this is verified in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] where the variation of @xmath53 is presented for the la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18al@xmath40o@xmath13 samples , showing a monotonic increase , in contrast to the decrease of @xmath3 against al concentration .",
    "we hereby emphasize that the variation of @xmath53 alone can not explain the variation of @xmath3 in @xmath54-site diluted manganites , even qualitatively .     of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath35o@xmath13 .",
    "@xmath55 for @xmath10 al or @xmath56 for ti .",
    "the @xmath57-symbols are for @xmath10 al@xmath58ti@xmath59 and @xmath36 al@xmath60ti@xmath61 .",
    "the inset shows original @xmath3 vs @xmath46 data . ]",
    "the variations of @xmath3 with @xmath46 for both series are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] .",
    "the effect of substitution with ti on the reduction of @xmath3 [ defined by @xmath62 is as much as more than twice that of al substitution .",
    "however , because of the selectivity of the substitution , it is more appropriate for @xmath3 to be presented vs the relative substitution concentration @xmath63 or @xmath64 for @xmath65 al or ti , respectively .",
    "interestingly , as can be seen in the main figure of fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , the @xmath11 data collapse on the same linear curve that follows very well the relation @xmath66 , being in consistent with a prediction derived from the molecular - field theory . according to mft , in a system",
    "where a magnetic ion with spin @xmath67 interacts with its @xmath68 nearest - neighbor ions with an exchange coupling constant @xmath69 , the ordering temperature is given by @xcite @xmath70 if the system is diluted by non - magnetic ions with concentration @xmath7 , @xmath68 can be written as @xmath71 , therefore @xmath72 ( here @xmath6 and @xmath73 both refer to the undiluted system ) . in the present case ,",
    "@xmath74 k as is measured for our la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath13 sample .    in hole - doped manganites , due to the mixed valence of mn ions and the resulting coexistence of antiferromagnetic ( af ) ( mn@xmath21-mn@xmath21 , mn@xmath22-mn@xmath22 ) se and fm ( mn@xmath21-mn@xmath22 ) de , @xmath3 should be better described as @xmath75 consequently , because of the selective nature of the dilution in our samples , the extrapolation of @xmath11 is supposed to intersect the @xmath7-axis at a certain relative concentration @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the tendency of @xmath11 to drop to zero at @xmath77 experimentally observed therefore unambiguously reflects the total dominance of fm de interaction in these systems .",
    "the other af se interactions would be effectively negligible .",
    "the absence of af se interactions may be one reason behind the fact that la@xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath13 has highest @xmath3 among @xmath78o@xmath13 perovskite manganites @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath11 would not follow the linear behavior up to @xmath77 as predicted by the mft because there should exist a percolation threshold @xmath79 , above which clustering occurs and the ferromagnetic network collapses into superparamagnetic short - range ordering .",
    "moreover , at high substitution concentrations , changes of crystalline structure and carrier concentration may become effective and dominate the magnetic properties .     against al concentration @xmath46 .",
    "the monotonic increase of @xmath80 is contradictory to the reduction in @xmath81 of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath18al@xmath40o@xmath13 . ]    in the case when both al and ti are substituted for mn with according @xmath7(al ) and @xmath7(ti ) , supposing that the fm de is totally dominant in the system , the effective dilution concentration of the whole system is determined as @xmath82[1-n_\\mathrm{p}(\\mathrm{ti } ) ] .",
    "\\label{eqn4}\\ ] ] the @xmath11 values of the @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) and @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) compounds are also added to fig .",
    "[ fig.3 ] , showing a fairly well fit to the mft prediction .",
    "the magnetic properties of la@xmath0sr@xmath1mn@xmath35o@xmath13 , where mn@xmath21 or mn@xmath22 is selectively substituted by al@xmath21 or ti@xmath22 , respectively , have been reexamined .",
    "the substitution appears to not only dilute the magnetic lattice , but also induce a redundancy of mn ions .",
    "we have also discovered that , in terms of selective dilution and in the low substitution range , @xmath3 linearly scales with @xmath7 , being in good agreement with the mft approximation .",
    "the tendency of @xmath3 to reduce to zero at @xmath77 suggests a totally dominant role of the de mechanism in this system ; the se interaction is effectively negligible .",
    "the mft analyzes are found to some extent also to be valid for the case when al and ti are both substituted for mn .",
    "our results also indicate that the variation of conduction electron bandwidth alone can not explain the change of @xmath3 in magnetically diluted manganites .",
    "this work has been performed partly under the sponsorship of a collaborative project between the institute of materials science ( vast , vietnam ) and uppsala university ( sweden ) .",
