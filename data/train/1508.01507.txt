    "let @xmath0 be a weighted graph .",
    "the laplacian matrix of @xmath1 is the @xmath2 matrix whose components are @xmath3    a classical result is that if @xmath4 , then @xmath5 is negative semidefinite , with the number of zero eigenvalues equal to the number of connected components of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "if some of the @xmath6 are negative , then @xmath5 can have positive eigenvalues as well . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors consider the problem where some subset of the @xmath6 are negative , and show upper and lower bounds on the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath5 that depend only on the `` sign topology '' of the graph , i.e. the pattern of which edges are positive and which are negative , regardless of their weights .",
    "more specifically , the main result of  @xcite is : assume that the graph is symmetric ( @xmath7 , and define @xmath8 ( resp .",
    "@xmath9 ) to be the subgraphs of @xmath1 containing only edges with positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) weights .",
    "let @xmath10 be the number of components of a graph @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath5 , then @xmath12 moreover , one can show that these bounds are saturated , i.e. for any integer in that range , there is some choice of weights that give exactly that many positive eigenvalues .",
    "( in fact , one can say much more about the genericity of the sets of weights that give these values , see  @xcite for more detail . )",
    "it follows from the formula above that if @xmath1 is a tree , then the number of positive eigenvalues is exactly the number of negatively weighted edges in the graph . to see this , notice that , for a tree , the number of connected components of @xmath8 is exactly one plus the number of negative edges : if we start with a tree with only positive edges , every flip of an edge from positive to negative will add another component to the positive subtree",
    "conversely , since the negative edges can not form a cycle , the number of connected components of @xmath9 is the number of vertices minus the number of negatively weighted edges . in short ,",
    "if @xmath1 is a tree , then @xmath11 is independent of the weights of the edges , and very easy to compute by inspection .",
    "now , consider the case where the graph has one cycle and one negative edge .",
    "it is easy to see in this case that the upper bound in   is one , and the lower bound is either zero ( if the negative edge lies in the cycle ) ; or one ( if the negative edge does not lie in the cycle ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the number of positive eigenvalues is again independent of the weights . in the former case , the weight on the edge matters , and it is not hard to imagine that the relative magnitude of the weight on the negative edge compared to the other edges in the cycle determines the stability .    from these examples",
    ", it is at least plausible to conjecture that the stability computation is something that can done on a cycle - by - cycle basis .",
    "this is further supported by previous work of the authors  @xcite , where it was shown that a certain quotient of @xmath13 by a subgroup was important for understanding the spectrum of the graph laplacian with positive and negative edges .",
    "in fact , this is the result of the current paper .",
    "let us denote the number of cycles by @xmath14 .",
    "then the main result of this paper is that the computation of the index of @xmath5 is the equivalent to computing the index of a particular @xmath15 matrix ( what we call the `` cycle intersection matrix '' ) . if @xmath16 , then this is clearly a much simpler problem ; the technique we describe here is most effective for sparse graphs .",
    "as stated above , the problem we consider is a pure linear algebra problem and can be stated as such , but in fact it is inspired and informed by considering its `` killer app '' , i.e. understanding the dimension of the unstable manifold of a fixed point of a nonlinearly coupled network dynamical system .",
    "some examples of the kinds of models we are interested in include the kuramoto problem on a general weighted connected graph @xmath17 , namely : @xmath18 more generally one can also consider the kuramoto ",
    "sakaguchi model@xcite @xmath19 as well as the swing equations , which govern the dynamics of a coupled system of generators and loads@xcite @xmath20 in each of these examples the dimension of the unstable manifold to a fixed point of the equations is given by the number of positive eigenvalues of a graph laplacian .",
    "the study of the fixed points of these systems , and their stability , has lead to a huge number of papers in the literature  @xcite .",
    "it has been widely observed that the behavior of solutions varies dramatically as the topology of the graph changes : these models are essentially trivial on a tree , but become more complex as the graph becomes denser .",
    "this again suggests that the first homology group @xmath21 , which counts the number of loops in the graph , should be important    to date , most of the analytical work has focused on special graph configurations with a high degree of symmetry .",
    "the most - studied case , where the behavior of the model is very well understood , is the case of `` all - to - all '' coupling , where the underlying graph is the complete graph @xmath22 , and all of the edge weights @xmath23 are equal . in a ground",
    "breaking paper  @xcite , mirollo and strogatz gave upper and lower bounds ( which differed by 1 ) on the dimension of the unstable manifold to an arbitrary fixed point solution to this model .",
    "drfler and bullo  @xcite gave a sufficient condition for the existence of a stable phase - locked solution , and two of the current authors  @xcite gave an explicit formula for the dimension of the unstable manifold .",
    "similarly verwoerd and mason give a proof of the existence of a critical coupling constant for the cases of the complete@xcite and bipartite graphs , and one of the current authors  @xcite gives some results on the minimizers and saddles for the kuramoto on cyclic graphs . for general topologies ,",
    "it was first observed by ermentrout  @xcite that if the graph is connected and all of the links are short ( the angle differences are less than @xmath24 ) then the fixed point is stable .",
    "we show in this paper that the intuition put forward in the preceeding paragraphs is correct .",
    "we show that , rather than computing the number of positive eigenvalues of the laplacian , an object that acts on the vertex space of the graph , there is a dual calculation that can be posed on the cycle space .",
    "this dual problem gives an alternative method for computing the dimension of the unstable manifold to a particular fixed point .",
    "this approach is particularly attractive for problems in which the graph is relatively sparse , and the dimension of the cycle space is much smaller than the dimension of the vertex space .",
    "we note that there are some very important applications for which this condition is satisfied .",
    "one example is the graphs associated with electrical power networks .",
    "such networks are governed by the swing equations   and these tend to be reasonably sparse .",
    "the following data is from cotilla - sanchez , hines , barrows and blumsack@xcite , who calculated the number of edges and vertices for the ieee 300 model ( a standard test power system ) as well as the eastern ( ei ) , western ( wi ) and texas ( ti ) interconnects , the largest components of the north american electrical network :    .sparsities of various electrical networks [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here we have found the first root of @xmath25 and compute @xmath26 : this is the distance between @xmath27 and @xmath28 if we choose the solution @xmath29 .",
    "note that in each case , the length of the link is greater than a quarter turn ( note that we are presenting the length divided by @xmath30 , so that a link is `` long '' iff it is greater than @xmath31 ) , but this distance decreases monotonically to @xmath31 as @xmath32 .",
    "note that in general , @xmath25 has multiple roots , so that the first root may not always give the largest link , but we have found empirically that this is so . as such , the numbers in table  [ tab : zeta ] represent the longest link possible for a stable fixed point of the kuramoto system on a ring of size @xmath33 .",
    "we can also compute the values of @xmath34 that give this solution . for all @xmath35 , we have @xmath36 , so that @xmath37 .",
    "however , we also have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "vertices in the ring : @xmath40 ( blue ) , @xmath41 ( orange ) , @xmath42 ( purple).,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    we plot several of the curves for the case of @xmath43 in figure  [ fig : curves ] .",
    "we have scaled @xmath44 so that all the curves are of the same order of magnitude ; note that only its sign matters .",
    "as shown above , where the blue curve is positive , the solution is stable .",
    "the purple curve is the cosine of the length of the @xmath45 link : since we see that this becomes negative before @xmath44 does , there is a stable long link configuration .",
    "finally , note that the zeros of @xmath44 correspond to the critical points of @xmath41 ( this can be checked ) , and thus the @xmath41 curve can be interpreted as a series of stable and unstable branches : whenever @xmath41 is increasing in @xmath46 , this corresponds to a stable solutions , and when it is decreasing , this corresponds to a @xmath47-saddle . as we slide up and down in this graph , this leads to saddle  node bifurcations in the obvious manner .",
    "moreover , note that the @xmath48 slice is the one considered in  @xcite  it was shown there that for @xmath43 there are two nontrivial sinks and two corresponding saddles , and this is recovered here . by decreasing or increasing @xmath49",
    ", we can cause these saddles to collide with either of two sinks .",
    "let @xmath50 be a connected graph .",
    "we define the * universal cover * of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a tree , then @xmath52 . if @xmath1 is not a tree , then @xmath51 is a countably infinite tree defined as follows :    * choose a root vertex @xmath53 . *",

    "choose @xmath63 to be any finite connected subtree of @xmath51 such that each edge of @xmath1 appears once .",
    "notice that by definition , @xmath1 and @xmath63 have the same edge sets , so we will write @xmath64 for either set . since there are @xmath65 edges in @xmath63 and it is a tree , then @xmath66 .",
    "we will also use the notation @xmath67 and @xmath68 throughout .",
    "the universal cover has certain properties :    1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is not a tree , then @xmath51 has countably many vertices .",
    "the degree of the node @xmath69 in @xmath51 is the same as the degree of @xmath70 in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , @xmath51 is locally finite .",
    "2 .   the map @xmath71 is a covering map , i.e. it is a map of graphs , it is surjective , and it is an isomorphism in the neighborhood of any vertex .",
    "the construction of @xmath63 is independent ( up to isomorphism ) of the choice of the root vertex @xmath72 .",
    "finally , it should be noted that we can construct @xmath63 directly without using the universal cover , see example  [ exa : diamond ] for an example .",
    "[ prop : surjection ] let @xmath62 be a connected weighted graph , and define @xmath63 as above . then the graph map @xmath73 given by @xmath74 is a surjective map .",
