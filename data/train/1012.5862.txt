    "network neutrality , one of the foundations of internet , is commonly admitted that isps must not discriminate traffic in order to favor specific content providers @xcite .",
    "however , the principle of network neutrality has been challenged recently .",
    "the main reason is that new broadband applications cause huge amount of traffic without generating direct revenues for isps .",
    "hence , isps want to get additional revenues from cps that are not directly connected to them .",
    "for instance , a residential isp might want to charge youtube in order to give a premium quality of service to youtube traffic .",
    "this kind of monetary flows , which violate the principle of network neutrality , are called _ two - sided payment_. we use the term _ side payment _ to name the money charged by isps from cps exclusively .",
    "on the one hand , the opponents of network neutrality argue that it does not give any incentive for isps to invest in the infrastructure .",
    "this incentive issue is even more severe in two cases : the one of tier - one isps that support a high load , but do not get any revenue from cps ; and the one of 3 g wireless networks that need to invest a huge amount of money to purchase spectrum . on the other hand , advocates of network neutrality claim that violating it using side payment will lead to unbalanced revenues among isps and cps , thus a market instability .",
    "recent work addressed the problem of network neutrality from various perspectives @xcite . among these work ,",
    "@xcite are the closest to our work .",
    "musacchio et al .",
    "@xcite compare one - sided and two - sided pricing of isps .",
    "however , they only investigate an example where the joint investments of cps and isps bring revenue from advertisers to cps . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show how side payment is harmful for all the parties involved such as isp and cp .",
    "altman et al . in @xcite",
    "present an interesting bargaining framework to decide how much the isp should charge the cp .",
    "however , their models might give a biased conclusion by overlooking the end users sensitivity towards the prices of the cp and the isp .",
    "in this paper , we unravel the conflicts of the side payment in a more general context .",
    "we consider a simplified market composed of one isp , one cp , some advertisers , and a large number of end users .",
    "the isp charges end - users based on their usage and sets their qos level according to the price paid .",
    "the cp can either have a _ subscription _ based or an _ advertisement _ based revenue model .",
    "for the subscription based revenue model , the cp gets its revenue from the subscription paid by end - users .",
    "end - users adapt their demand of content based on the price paid to the isp and the cp . for the advertisement based revenue model",
    ", the cp gets its revenue from advertisers .",
    "end users adapt the demand according to the price paid to the isp and the investment of cp on its contents .",
    "our work differs from related work @xcite by : i ) incorporating the qos provided by the isp , ii ) studying different revenue models of the cp , and iii ) introducing the _ relative price sensitivity _ of end users in the subscription model .",
    "especially , in the subscription model , the _ relative price sensitivity _ decides whether the side payment is beneficial ( or harmful ) to the isp and the cp .",
    "our finding contradicts the previous work ( e.g. @xcite ) that argues that the side payment is harmful for all parties involved . in the advertisement model , the ability of cp s investment to attract the traffic of end users plays a key role .",
    "it determines whether the side payment is profitable for the isp and the cp .",
    "our main contributions are the following .",
    "* we present new features in the mathematical modeling that include the qos , the relative price sensitivity of end - users , and the cp s revenues . *",
    "we model the price competition between the isp and the _ subscription _ based cp as a noncooperative game and analyze the properties of the nash equilibrium .",
    "the interaction between the isp and the _ advertisement _ based cp is modeled as an optimization problem .",
    "the optimal investment is shown to be a decreasing function of the side payment ( from the cp to the isp ) . *",
    "we utilize bargaining games to analyze how the side payment is determined .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in section [ sec :",
    "model ] , we model the economic behaviors of isp , cp , advertisers and end users .",
    "section [ sec : subscription ] and [ sec : advertisement ] study the impact of side payment and how the isp and the cp reach a consensus of side payment .",
    "section [ sec : evaluation ] presents numerical study to validate our claims .",
    "section [ sec : conclusion ] concludes this paper .",
    "in this section , we first introduce the revenue models of the isp and the cp . then , we formulate a game problem and an optimization problem for the selfish isp and the cp .",
    "finally , we describe the bargaining games in a two - sided market .",
    "we consider a simplified networking market with four economic entities , namely the advertisers , the cp , the isp and end users .",
    "all the end users can access the contents of the cp _ only _ through the network infrastructure provided by the isp .",
    "the isp collects subscription fees from end users .",
    "it sets two market parameters @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the non - negative price of per - unit of demand , and @xmath2 is the qos measure ( e.g. delay , loss or rejection probability ) .",
    "end users can decide whether to connect to the isp or not , or how much traffic they will request , depending on the bandwidth price and the qos .",
    "the cp usually has two revenue models , the _ user subscription _ and the _ advertisement _ from clicks of users .",
    "these two models , though sometimes coexisting with each other , are studied separately in this work for clarity .",
    "the cp and the isp interact with each other in a way that depends on the cp s revenue models . in the subscription based model ,",
    "the cp competes with the isp by charging users a price @xmath3 per - unit of content within a finite time .",
    "end users respond to @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath2 by setting their demands elastically .",
    "though @xmath3 has a different unit as @xmath1 , it can be mapped from the price per content into the price per bps ( i.e. dividing the price of a content by its size in a finite time ) .",
    "the price @xmath3 not only can stand for a financial disutility , but also can represent the combination of this disutility together with a cost per quality .",
    "thus a higher price may be associated with some better quality ( this quality would stand for parameters different than the parameter @xmath2 which we introduce later ) . without loss of generality ,",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath3 can be positive or 0 . for the _ advertisement _ based model , instead of charging users directly , the cp attracts users clicks on online advertisements . the more traffic demands end users generate , the higher the cp s revenue .    to better understand network neutrality and non - neutrality , we describe the monetary flows among different components . the arrows in figure [ fig : moneyflow ] represent the recipients of money .",
    "a `` neutral network '' does not allow an isp to charge a cp for which it is not a direct provider for sending information to this isp s users . on the contrary , monetary flow from a cp to an isp appears when `` network neutrality '' is violated .",
    "the isp may charge the cp an additional amount of money that we denote by @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the price of per - unit of demand .",
    "we denote by @xmath6 $ ] the tax rate of this transferred revenue imposed by the regulator or the government to the isp .",
    "we present market demand functions for the _ subscription _ and the _ advertisement _ based revenue models .",
    "let us define the average demand of all users by @xmath7 that has @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are all positive constants .",
    "the parameter @xmath9 reflects the total potential demand of users .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the responsiveness of demand to the price and the qos level of the isp .",
    "the physical meaning of can be interpreted in this way .",
    "when the prices of the isp and the cp increase ( resp . decrease ) , the demand decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) .",
    "if the qos of the isp is improved , the demand from users increases correspondingly .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 represents the relative sensitivity of @xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "we deliberately set different sensitivities of end users to the prices of the isp and the cp because @xmath3 and @xmath1 refers to different type of disutilities . if @xmath13 , the prices of the isp and the cp are regarded as having the same effect on @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath14 , users are more sensitive to the change of @xmath3 than @xmath1 .",
    "the positive prices @xmath1 and @xmath3 can not be arbitrarily high . they must guarantee a nonnegative demand @xmath7 .",
    "we denote @xmath15 to be the pricing strategy of the cp that has @xmath16 .",
    "the utility ( or revenue equivalently ) of the cp is expressed as @xmath17 note that the variable @xmath18 is interchangeable with @xmath7 all the time .",
    "next , we present the utility of the isp with qos consideration .",
    "we assume that the pricing strategy of the isp is defined by @xmath19 . to sustain a certain qos level of users , the isp has to pay the costs for operating the backbone , the last - mile access , and the upgrade of the network , etc .",
    "let @xmath20 be the amount of bandwidth consumed by users that depends on the demand @xmath7 and the qos level @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath20 is a positive , convex and strictly increasing function in the 2-tuple @xmath21 .",
    "this is reasonable because a larger demand or higher qos usually requires a larger bandwidth of the isp .",
    "we now present a natural qos metric as the expected delay .",
    "the expected delay is computed by the kleinrock function that corresponds to the delay of m / m/1 queue with fifo discipline or m / g/1 queue under processor sharing @xcite .",
    "similar to @xcite , instead of using the actual delay , we consider the reciprocal of its square root , @xmath22 .",
    "thus , the cost @xmath23 can be expressed as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 the price of per - unit of bandwidth invested by the isp .",
    "therefore , the cost of the isp is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "the utility of the isp is defined as the difference between revenue and cost : @xmath27      nowadays , a small proportion of cps like rapidshare and iptv providers get their income from end users .",
    "most of other cps provide contents for free , but collect revenues from advertisers .",
    "the demand from users is transformed into attentions such as clicks or browsing of online advertisements . to attract more eyeballs",
    ", a cp needs to invest money on its contents , incurring a cost @xmath28 .",
    "the investment improves the potential aggregate demand @xmath9 in return .",
    "let @xmath29 be a concave and strictly increasing function of cost @xmath28 . with abuse of notations",
    "we denote the strategy of the cp by @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the demand to the cp and the isp is written as @xmath31 the utility of the isp is the same as that in .",
    "next , we describe the economic interaction between advertisers and the cp",
    ". there are @xmath32 advertisers interested in the cp , each of which has a fixed budget @xmath33 in a given time interval ( e.g. , daily , weekly or monthly ) .",
    "an advertiser also has a valuation @xmath34 to declare its maximum willingness to pay for each attention .",
    "the valuation @xmath34 is a random variable in the range @xmath35 $ ] .",
    "suppose that @xmath34 is characterized by probability density function ( pdf ) @xmath36 and cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath37 .",
    "we assume that the valuations of all advertisers are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d ) .",
    "let @xmath38 be the price of per attention charged by the cp .",
    "we denote by @xmath39 the demand of attentions from advertisers to the cp .",
    "therefore , @xmath40 can be expressed as @xcite @xmath41 when the cp increases @xmath38 , the advertisers will reduce their purchase of attentions .",
    "it is also easy to see that the revenue of advertising , @xmath42 , decreases with regard to @xmath38 either .",
    "however , the attentions that the cp can provide is upper bounded by the demand of users through the isp .",
    "then , we can rewrite @xmath40 as that in @xcite by @xmath43 correspondingly , subtracting investment from revenue , we obtain the utility of the cp by @xmath44    [ lemma : normal_property1 ] the optimal demand @xmath40 is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath38 if the pdf @xmath36 is nonzero in @xmath45 .    *",
    "proof : * according to , there has @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrarily small positive constant .",
    "this is because @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "hence , @xmath40 is a strictly decreasing function of @xmath38 .    to illustrate how the optimal @xmath38 is found , we follow @xcite by drawing figure [ fig : revenue_cp ] .",
    "the x - coordinate denotes the price @xmath38 and the y - coordinate denotes the cp s revenue .",
    "the curve in red represents the revenue of the cp coming from advertisers .",
    "the optimal price @xmath50 is obtained at @xmath51 . here",
    ", we denote a function @xmath52 such that @xmath53 . according to the demand curve of attentions , @xmath52 is a decreasing function of @xmath7 .",
    "the utility of the cp is a function of the demand @xmath7 and the cost @xmath28 , i.e. @xmath54 .",
    ", width=211 ]      two economic entities , the isp and the cp , want to maximize their utilities . with the subscription model ,",
    "the strategy profile of the isp is to set the 2-tuple @xmath0 and that of the cp is to set @xmath3 .",
    "this is actually a game problem in which the isp and the cp compete by setting their prices .",
    "the isp s qos is tunable .",
    "thus , we call this game `` qos agile price competition '' . with the advertisement model ,",
    "the strategy of the isp is still the price paid by end users , while that of the cp is to determine the investment level @xmath28 .",
    "the isp and the cp maximize their own utilities selfishly , but do not compete with each other .",

    "a subsequent and important problem is how large the side payment should be .",

    "if the isp plays a strategy @xmath59 and the cp plays @xmath3 , the noncooperative game leads to a zero demand and hence a zero income .",
    "this can be easily verified by taking the derivative of @xmath60 over @xmath5 ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "in other words , the isp can not set @xmath5 and @xmath1 simultaneously in the price competition .",
    "similarly , with the advertisement based model , the isp meets with the same paradox .",
