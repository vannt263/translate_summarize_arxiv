    "in @xcite we have shown ( see also @xcite in this volume ) that the large - scale structure in n - body simulations , which is believed to describe adequately the galaxy distribution in redshift catalogues , can be explained directly by the geometry of the initial density field , amplified by gravitational instability . while rich clusters of galaxies form from high density enhancements of scales @xmath0 , intracluster filamentary webbing",
    "reflects initial connections in the random density field bridging these protocluster regions at lower density thresholds .",
    "the quantitative study of the properties of 3d random fields in a cosmological context goes back to the famous formula of doroshkevich @xcite for the joint distribution function @xmath1 of the ordered eigenvalues @xmath2 of the initial deformation ( shear ) tensor @xmath3 .",
    "the latter is related to the density field , given in fourier space by ( random ) amplitudes @xmath4 , by @xmath5 the filter @xmath6 separates the smooth large - scale field which evolves in the mildly nonlinear single - stream regime from the highly nonlinear short - scale chaotic flow .    usually ,",
    "the dynamical role of the shear in a local gravitational collapse is being focused on . here",
    "we stress another aspect of the shear tensor : as a shape parameter describing the _ geometry _ of the initial density field . the mean overdensity profile around a field point @xmath7 with known values of the shear , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , as illustrated in fig .  1 , shows that the shape depends on the sign of the shear eigenvalues ( see @xcite for details of these and subsequent analytical calculations , also @xcite ) . in effect",

    "is much more local and less representative of the density behaviour at large distances from the constraint point . ]",
    "= 4.5 in    the increase in the density along one axis while falling off along the remaining two is symptomatic of filamentary bridges that connect the higher density regions where the shape of the density profile is more spherical .",
    "2 shows that local properties of the shear tensor determine whether the region is part of the filamentary or protocluster structure .",
    "= 4.5 in    this correspondence between the global properties of the density field and local characteristics of the shear tensor enables analytical estimation of the gross properties of the cosmic web .",
    "for instance , the probability of the eigenvalue signature given the density threshold @xmath11 , @xmath12 , shows which structures dominates depends on the isodensity threshold chosen .",
    "3 shows that at overdensities above a critical @xmath11 , 1.56@xmath13 for gaussian fields , one encounters predominantly spherical - like mass concentrations , while at the lower density contrast , @xmath14 , most of the initial density enhancements are in elongated filamentary bridges .",
    "planar configurations ( + ) are less likely for any positive overdensities @xmath15 .",
    "the related quantity @xmath16 gives us the density distribution within different types of structure . while the average density of the filaments in the initial configuration is equal to @xmath17 ( fig .",
    "3 ) , it is the 1.52@xmath18 excursions which are precursors of the rare prominent filaments . in contrast , even rare planar , membrane - like , configurations are expected only at lower overdensities of 0.51@xmath18 .    as a simple nonlinear model for evolution of clusters , filaments and membranes ,",
    "let us consider the evolution of a shell which is spherical ( @xmath19=3 ) or cylindrical ( @xmath19=2 ) of radius @xmath20 , or planar ( @xmath19=1 ) of width @xmath21 which expands with the hubble flow in the other @xmath22 directions ( c.f .",

    "the shell is characterized by its lagrangian tophat scale @xmath23 and the linear overdensity within the shell @xmath24 .",
    "evolution of the shell radius in different cosmologies with scale factor @xmath25 is given by and @xmath26 are present - day density parameters of the matter and the cosmological constant .",

    "these values should be compared with the density of the collapsed spherical halos at the moment of virialization , @xmath32 .",
    "n - body simulations confirm these simple estimates .",
    "the filamentary pattern that joins galaxy clusters into a complex web is manifest in 3d galaxy catalogues .",
    "however the question of biasing between the galaxy distribution and the underlying mass density remains open . in recent work",
    "@xcite we evaluated the feasibility of mapping the intracluster structure using observational techniques directly probing large - scale dark matter and gas distributions .",
    "we have performed gasdynamical simulations ( using a sph+treep@xmath33 m code @xcite ) of several rich supercluster regions and considered the weak gravitational lensing of high redshift galaxies by the low redshift structure , the secondary variations in cmb temperature induced by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect and the x - ray emission by hot gas in clusters and along the filaments .",
    "the simulations and sz maps derived from them are described in our companion paper @xcite .",
    "since the lensing depends upon the projected density @xmath34 , not pressure as for the sz effect or density - squared as for the x - rays , weak lensing would be a better probe for the filaments if the signal - to - noise is large enough .",
    "there are two sources of noise , one the intrinsic ( random ) ellipticities of the source galaxies , and the other shear from ambient large scale structures along the line - of - sight confusing the ellipticity pattern created by the filamentary web .",
    "results of our simulations for standard cdm , open cdm and a cdm model with a cosmological constant are presented in fig .",
    "they demonstrate that cluster - cluster bridges at redshifts @xmath35 are sufficiently developed to produce lensing of background galaxies at the level of several percent which can be detected in the images of modern wide field cameras .",
