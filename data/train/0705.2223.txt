    "in a previous work@xcite , we introduced a new formalism where , instead of implementing a dynamical foliation by taking a spatial dependence of the fifth coordinate including its time dependence , we considered another extra dimension , the sixth dimension , making possible the implementation of two dynamical foliations in a sequential manner .",
    "the first one was considered by choosing the fifth coordinate depending of the cosmic time , and the second one by choosing the sixth coordinate as dependent of the 3d spatial coordinates ( in our case considered as isotropic ) .",
    "of course , all of these choices preserve the continuity of the metric .",
    "in addition , the 6d metric must be ricci - flat .",
    "this requirement is a natural extension of the vacuum condition used in the stm theory@xcite , in which 5d ricci - flat metrics are used@xcite and the cylinder condition has been eliminated in favor of retaining the metric s dependence on the extra coordinate . in simple words , we used the campbell - magaard theorem@xcite and its extensions for embedding a 5d ricci - flat space - time in a 6d ricci - flat space - time .",
    "the conditions of 6d ricci - flatness and the continuity of the metric gives us the foliation of the sixth coordinate .",
    "these conditions specify the sixth dimension as a function of the 3d spatial coordinates , in order to establish the foliation .",
    "this function , for a particular 6d metric , can be seen in 4d as a gravitational potential related to a localized compact object that has the characteristics of a white hole . from a more general point of view , this is a mechanism for inducing localized matter onto a time - varying 4d hypersurface by establishing a spatial foliation of a sixth coordinate from a 6d ricci - flat metric .",
    "the importance of this approach lies in that it can describe matter at both , cosmological and astrophysical scales , in an expanding universe .",
    "the use of 6d physics is currently popular in particle physics@xcite , but with the sixth dimension as time - like , rather than space - like .",
    "+ in this letter we aim to study some predictions of this model on astrophysical scales .",
    "the power spectrum of matter is one of the most important statistics to describe the large - scale and astrophysical - scale structures of the universe .",
    "the studies developed in the last years have shown that on astrophysical scales the power spectrum of galaxies and clusters of galaxies can be satisfactorily expressed by a power law with an index between @xmath0 and @xmath1@xcite . on larger scales",
    "the spectrum turns over reaching a maximum on scales of @xmath2 .",
    "we shall suppose that the evolution of structure in the universe is only due to gravity .",
    "in order to describe a 6d vacuum , we consider the recently introduced 6d riemann - flat metric@xcite @xmath3 -d\\psi^2 - d\\sigma^2\\ ] ] which defines a 6d vacuum state @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "we consider the 3d spatial space in spherical coordinates : @xmath6 ; here @xmath7 .",
    "the metric ( [ ini ] ) resembles the 5d ponce de leon one@xcite , but with one additional space - like dimension .",
    "furthermore , the coordinate @xmath8 is dimensionless and the extra ( space - like ) coordinates @xmath9 and @xmath10 are considered as noncompact .",

    "however , it becomes riemann - flat in the limit @xmath22 i.e. @xmath23 , so that in this limit a 5d vacuum given by @xmath24 , ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "hence , we can take the foliation @xmath26 in the metric ( [ 5d ] ) on the sixth coordinate , and we obtain the effective 4d metric @xmath27,\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the cosmic time , and @xmath29 is the hubble parameter for the scale factor @xmath30 , with @xmath31 .",
