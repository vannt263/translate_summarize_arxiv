    "it is thus possible that for ms - ms collisions , values of @xmath118 and @xmath150 that results in total mass loss rates just below @xmath246 could be pushed past this threshold with the addition of mass loss due to rg collisions .",
    "however , we believe that this is unlikely for two reasons .",
    "the inclusion of the factor , @xmath205 , when calculating the total mass loss rate ( see equation  ( [ eq : total_mass_loss_rate ] ) ) will reduce the mass loss by at least a factor of 0.6 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta ] ) .",
    "also , as noted by the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , for a typical rg - ms star collision , at most @xmath322 of the rg envelope is lost to the rg .",
    "this will reduce @xmath324 for rg - ms collisions by another factor of 10 .",
    "an upper limit to the mass loss rate due to collisions between rg and ms stars .",
    "the arrow indicates the range in the x - ray observations ( @xmath169 ) with which we use to constrain the pdmf ( see  [ sec : constrain ] ) . ]",
    "we have have derived novel , analytical methods for calculating the amount of mass loss from indirect and direct stellar collisions in the galactic centre .",
    "our methods compares very well to hydrodynamic simulations , and do not require costly amounts of computation time . we have also computed the total mass loss rate in the galactic centre due to stellar collisions . mass loss from direct collisions dominates at galactic radii below @xmath325 , and thereafter indirect collisions dominate the total mass loss rate . since the amount of stellar material lost in the collision depends upon the masses of the colliding stars , the total mass loss rate depends upon the pdmf .",
    "we find that the calculated mass loss rate is sensitive to the pdmf used , and can therefore be used to constrain the pdmf in the galactic centre .",
    "as summarized by fig .",
    "[ fig : param_space ] , our calculations rule out @xmath217 and @xmath326 in the @xmath327 parameter space .",
    "finally , we have used our constraints on the pdmf in the galactic centre to constrain the imf to have a power - law slope @xmath328 0.4 to 0.9 depending on the star formation history of the galactic centre .",
