    "in the last years , trapped degenerate two - component fermi atomic gases have received great interest both from the theoretical @xcite and the experimental @xcite point of view .",
    "one of the reasons is that these systems offer an ideal scenario to study pairing interactions at variable interaction strength , density and temperature .",
    "it has been recognized that atoms like @xmath1k and @xmath2li exhibit magnetically tunable feshbach resonances so that the @xmath3-wave scattering interaction may be varied from repulsive to strongly attractive .",
    "the accessible states for a dilute gas of trapped atoms may be modeled in the zeroth - order approximation as a system of noninteracting particles . the simplest theoretical approach for describing trapped fermi atoms",
    "when the interactions are not negligible , consists in approximating the system wave function as properly symmetrized products of one - particle eigenstates of an effective harmonic oscillator , whose frequency is determined via a variational procedure .",
    "the purpose of this work is to make an study of the predictions of such an approach . in particular , we obtain closed expressions of the total interaction energy that reflect its increasing relevance as the number of particles in the system is augmented , as well as closed expressions for pairing energies of atoms within a given shell .",
    "let us consider a gas of fermi atoms of mass @xmath4 with internal states @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "they are in a harmonic trap that for simplicity will be assumed to be of spherical symmetry and characterized by a frequency @xmath7 .",
    "an asymmetric harmonic trap can be treated in a completely analogous way .",
    "we model the interaction between atoms in different internal states by an effective contact potential @xmath8 with @xmath9 the scattering length .",
    "this potential is based on scattering theory at low energies .",
    "it is inexact for at least two reasons : it takes into account neither higher partial waves nor the dependence of s - wave scattering on the momentum transfer .",
    "one consequence of the latter is that no parameters beyond the scattering length such as the effective range are included in eq.([eq : s1 ] ) .",
    "thus , this potential is expected to be valid for low energy transfer .",
    "in fact it has proven to be useful to describe cold atoms at low densities @xcite and it could also be important for intermediate densities by introducing an effective scattering length @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system is taken as @xmath10 + \\sum_{i^\\downarrow , j^\\uparrow } v(\\vec x_{i^\\downarrow}-\\vec x_{j^\\uparrow } ) .",
    "\\label{eq : s2}\\ ] ] we are interested in obtaining approximate eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian using the variational method .",
    "the validity of such an approach is limited by the reliability of the model hamiltonian . as a trial wave function",
    ", we consider the product of two slater determinants , one for each internal state .",
    "these determinants are built up by the one particle eigenfunctions of a spherical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath11 and quantum numbers @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the value of @xmath11 should reflect the interaction effects and in the limit of zero interaction it becomes @xmath14 .",
    "notice , however , that dramatic changes in @xmath11 with respect to @xmath7 are incompatible with the assumptions supporting the use of the contact interaction potential ( [ eq : s1 ] ) .",
    "taking into account the results summarized in the appendix , the expectation value of the hamiltonian for this trial function is found to be @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the number of particles in a given internal state @xmath19 , @xmath20 the scattering length in natural units and @xmath21 @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 can be identified with the trap , zero point and interaction energies in units of @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "taking @xmath26 as a variational parameter , the condition that the expectation value of the hamiltonian becomes an extremum reduces to @xmath27 if the scattering length is negative , in order to admit a variational solution corresponding to a minimum of the energy it is necessary that @xmath28    once the proper value of the variational parameter has been determined , the properties of the system can be estimated .",
    "in particular , the pairing energy between two particles of quantum numbers @xmath29 , @xmath30 whose wave functions are @xmath31 and @xmath32 is given by @xmath33 for atoms in a trap with effective frequency @xmath11 , an energy level @xmath34 exhibits a degeneracy @xmath35 arising from the condition @xmath36 . then the pairing energy between two particles in the same shell is directly given by the restriction @xmath37 . in order to illustrate the pairing energy features , let us explore the behavior of the universal dimensionless quantity @xmath38 for a given quantum number @xmath39 , the integrals @xmath40 achieve its maximum value for @xmath41 . in figure 1 , we plot the allowed region of the @xmath42 values , delimited by solid line curves .",
    "they correspond to its maximum @xmath43 ( top ) and minimum @xmath44 ( bottom ) values , for @xmath45 .",
    "systematically @xmath43 corresponds to two quantum numbers equal to zero , for instance , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , while @xmath48 .",
    "meanwhile @xmath44 is achieved when @xmath49 is decomposed , @xmath50 @xmath51 , in the form @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "as a particular application of these formulae we consider the ground state wave function corresponding to a configuration where all the possible states up to the non interacting fermi energy @xmath54 are occupied . to characterize the system under these conditions , we need to calculate the summations",
    "@xmath55 the first sum let us evaluate the number of particles @xmath18 for such a configuration in terms of the fermi energy . while the second gives one third of the corresponding trap energy @xmath56 , in @xmath57 units , neglecting the zero point energy .",
    "notice that for large @xmath58 the trap energy becomes @xmath59.\\ ] ] that is , the discrete summation relation between these variables coincides with that obtained in the standard procedure that works with an approximate continuum spectra . in table",
    "i , the behavior of the dimensionless quantities @xmath60 , @xmath56 and @xmath61 as a function of @xmath62 is illustrated .",
    "notice the increasing relevance of the interaction term @xmath63 compared to the @xmath22 .",
    "while at @xmath64 it represents only a @xmath65 , at @xmath66 it becomes @xmath67 as big as @xmath22 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath68 , we have found that @xmath63 has a polynomial behavior of the form @xmath69 with @xmath70 with a relative error of the order of @xmath71 for @xmath72 and of order less or equal to @xmath73 for @xmath74 .",
    "that is , our numerical calculations show that the interaction energy scales as @xmath75 for large @xmath62 growing faster than @xmath76 .",
    "this numerical result can be understood within the mean field approximation as follows :    in general , for a given mixture of fermi atoms described by the product of two slater determinants formed by one - particle eigenfunctions @xmath77 of an effective one particle hamiltonian , @xmath78 , the expectation value of a contact interaction potential is determined by @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the spatial density of atoms of _ i_-type . in our problem ,",
    "the one particle hamiltonian is that of a spherical harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath11 .",
    "then , at zero temperature and for a large number of atoms , the thomas - fermi approximation leads to the expression @xcite @xmath81^{3/2 } , \\quad\\quad r_f=\\big[\\frac{2\\epsilon_f}{m\\omega^{\\prime 2}}\\big]^{1/2}.\\ ] ] so that , @xmath82^{4.5}\\\\ & \\sim & 0.004118625 \\hspace{.2 cm } g \\hbar\\omega_0 a^{3/2}{\\cal m}_f^{4.5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] eq .",
    "( [ eq : int ] ) is consistent with the later result and , in fact , generalizes this formula for small @xmath62 .",
    "another useful result to exploit the variational approach , for large @xmath83 , is that the variational equation ( [ eq : avar ] ) can be approximated by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the characteristic size of the trapped degenerate fermi gas in the natural units of the trap . in table",
    "ii , the results of the variational calculation are exemplified for @xmath86 , corresponding to about half a million atoms of a given internal state .",
    "an attractive interaction is considered and the corresponding coupling constant @xmath87 is varied , leading to optimal values of @xmath26 via the variational equation .",
    "notice that the information about the trap parameter ( @xmath7 ) and the atom characteristics ( @xmath4 and @xmath9 ) are contained in @xmath87 . therefore the results are not restricted to neither a specific atom nor trap . in this table , the exact expectation values of the hamiltonian in @xmath57 units divided by the total number of particles @xmath88 are shown for @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) and for an optimized choosing of the variational parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath91 ) . as predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq : acon ] ) no minima can be found for @xmath92 . in this case",
    "the expectation value of the energy exhibits a maximum at a given value of @xmath93 and decreases monotonically for @xmath94 .",
    "that is , the gas would behave as trapped in a harmonic potential of arbitrarily large frequency .",
    "therefore , it would collapse .",
    "however , this prediction is beyond the validity region of the model .",
    "a mechanical instability of a strongly interacting fermi gas arises when attractive interactions overcome repulsive effects such as the fermi pressure @xcite . in actual experimental realizations @xcite , there are mechanisms not represented by the simple model eq.([eq : s1 ] ) that may stabilize the system .",
    "for instance , repulsive contributions to the interaction arising from higher order partial waves @xcite , or within the s - wave scattering scheme , effective potentials resulting from adding the ladder diagrams in a many - body perturbative approach @xcite . assuming densities that guarantee an interatomic separation larger than the range of the potential but much shorter than the scattering length",
    ", heiselberg found that an effective s - scattering amplitude arises , which always favors the stability of a two component fermi gas .",
    "a mixture of spin - polarized atomic @xmath2li in two possible hyperfine states constitutes a specially interesting system @xcite .",
    "it exhibits magnetic tunable feshbach resonances that enable the variation of the scattering length from strongly repulsive to strongly attractive .",
    "in fact , an anomalously large and negative scattering length @xmath95 a@xmath96 has been already measured @xcite .",
    "the coupling constant corresponding to this value of @xmath9 , for a typical trap of mean frequency @xmath97khz is @xmath98 .",
    "then the effective frequency for half a million atoms is @xmath99 .",
    "it differs significantly from the trap frequency ; the model potential and our variational approach are at the border of its applicability .",

    "the behavior of the dimensionless quantity @xmath113 as a function of the temperature is exemplified for @xmath114 .",
    "we can observe that although the interaction may be negligible for @xmath115 its relevance increases dramatically for @xmath116 .",

    "for a spherical trap , there is no privileged axis of oscillation .",
    "meanwhile , a direct extension of the results here obtained , shows that for a completely asymmetric trap , oscillations in the direction of the highest effective frequency exhibit a higher pairing energy .",
    "these results can be compared with those found for the isotropic trap in spherical coordinates @xcite .",
    "there the individual wave functions have a well defined angular momentum @xmath122 , and it is natural to consider paired state functions within a given shell @xmath49 that are eigenfunctions of the total angular momentum @xmath123 . in that case",
    "the greatest pairing energies correspond to @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "these paring energies @xmath126 @xmath104 decrease as @xmath49 increases . for our much simpler two - particle states , @xmath43 decreases as @xmath49",

    "both the model potential and the simple trial wave function have not a clear justification . as an extension to finite temperature we elaborate on a possible form of the interaction energy expectation value and find that it becomes increasingly relevant for @xmath116 as @xmath105 diminishes .",
    "the approximations made in this work could be valid not just for dilute gases but also for denser systems by taking @xmath9 as an effective scattering length .",
    "a more precise study can be made by solving the hartree - fock equations of the system using the contact interaction @xcite or working with a different model potential and more sophisticated trial wave functions @xcite .",
