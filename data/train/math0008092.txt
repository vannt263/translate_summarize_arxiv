    "in 1996 , l.  kauffman introduced the notion of a virtual knot , which is motivated by study of knots in a thickened surface and abstract gauss codes , cf . .",
    "according to m.  goussarov , m.  polyak and o.  viro , two classical knot diagrams represent the same knot type if and only if they represent the same virtual knot type .",
    "thus , the notion of a virtual knot is a generalization of a classical knot in 3-space . some properties and applications of virtual knots",
    "are found in , etc .    using the basic moves appearing in the definition of a virtual knot",
    ", we obtain the notion of a virtual braid ( cf . ) .",
    "it is closely related with the welded braid group @xmath0 and the braid - permutation group @xmath1 .",
    "r. fenn , r. rimnyi and c. rourke defined the groups @xmath0 and @xmath1 and proved that they are isomorphic .",
    "there is a canonical epimorphism from the virtual braid group @xmath2 to the welded braid group @xmath0 , and the group @xmath2 contains the braid group @xmath3 and the symmetric group @xmath4 as subsets in a natural way .",
    "braid theory plays an important role in classical knot theory .",
    "the two theories are related by alexander s and markov s theorems which state that every knot ( or link ) type is represented by the closure of a braid and such a braid presentation is unique up to conjugations and stabilizations ( cf . ) .",
    "there is a one - to - one correspondence between links and braids modulo these operations .",
    "analogously , virtual braid theory is expected to be so in virtual knot theory .",
    "it is quite easy to prove the alexander theorem for virtual knots ; that is , every virtual link type is represented by the closure of a virtual braid .",
    "in fact , this is obvious from the relationship between virtual links and gauss diagrams , or gauss codes given in . in , kauffman asked whether there is a generalization of the markov theorem for virtual knots .",
    "our main result is the following , which is an answer to his question and ensures a relationship between virtual braid theory and virtual knot theory .",

    "the last move ( @xmath11-move ) is an analogue of an exchange move ( cf . ) . in the category of classical braids ,",
    "an exchange move is a consequence of markov moves .",
    "however its analogy does not hold in the category of virtual braids ( proposition  3.3 ) .",
    "thus @xmath11-moves are essential . by theorem  3.2 , a left stabilization of any type ( defined in ",
    "3 ) is realized by @xmath8- , @xmath9- , @xmath10- and @xmath11-moves .",
    "if the left stabilization is of virtual type , then it can be realized without @xmath11-moves ( proposition  3.4 ) .",
    "this is analogous to a fact that a left stabilization of positive / negative type for classical braids is realized by markov moves .",
    "it is rather surprising that a left stabilization of positive / negative type for virtual braids is not realized by @xmath8- , @xmath9- and @xmath10-moves ( proposition  3.5 ) .",
    "most of known virtual knot invariants , as groups , quandles , alexander polynomials , and f - polynomials ( jones polynomials , normalized bracket polynomials ) , are considered and calculated easily via virtual braids ( see for these invariants ) : group presentations and quandle presentations are obtained from virtual braids by a method which is completely analogous to that in classical knot theory ( although upper presentation and lower presentation yield different groups and quandles in general , ) .",
    "the burau representation is easily defined for virtual braids and it brings alexander polynomials .",
    "the notion of temperley - lieb algebra is generalized to virtual ones and its basis is much simpler than the classical one , . using the virtual temperley - lieb algebra ,",
    "one can obtain the f - polynomials via braids .",
    "very recently , d. silver and s. williams found a new group invariant for a virtual link ( with @xmath12 components ) and a @xmath13-variable polynomial invariant derived from it .",
    "j.  sawollek also found a similar invariant .",
    "their invariants are so powerful as to distinguish the trivial knot and kauffman s example of a virtual knot which can not be distinguished by all of the above invariants .",
    "( j. s. carter proved this fact independently by an argument in ) .",
    "d. silver informed the author that their invariant in was motivated by the burau representation and it is natural to consider via virtual braids .",
    "related topics to these invariants from a point of view of virtual braids will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "welded braid theory due to fenn , rimnyi and rourke yields the notion of welded knots and links , which are also known as virtual knots and links in the weak sense ( ) .",
    "we prove alexander s and markov s theorems for welded knots and links .",
