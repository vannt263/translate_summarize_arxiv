    "this paper focuses on the notion of a translation - like action , introduced by kevin whyte in @xcite , and its relevance to geometric versions of burnside s problem and the von neumann conjecture .",
    "the classical burnside s problem asks if every finitely generated infinite group contains @xmath0 as a subgroup , and the classical von neumann conjecture states that a group is non - amenable if and only if it contains a non - abelian free group as a subgroup .",
    "although both of these problems are known to have negative answers ( by work of golod  shafarevich @xcite and olshanskii @xcite , respectively ) , translation - like actions provide us with a new geometric perspective of these classical problems .",
    "study of this notion in turn leads us to findings about hamiltonian paths , regular spanning trees of cayley graphs , and tilings of groups .",
    "while we are primarily interested in translation - like actions on groups , we are naturally led to consider translation - like actions on graphs as well .",
    "we therefore present a general definition of translation - like actions .",
    "[ def trans act ] let @xmath3 be a group and let @xmath4 be a metric space . a right action @xmath5 of @xmath3 on @xmath6 is _ translation - like _ if it satisfies the following two conditions :    1 .",
    "the action is free ( i.e. @xmath7 implies @xmath8 ) ; 2 .   for every @xmath9 the set @xmath10 is bounded",
    ";    we view every finitely generated group as a metric space by using a left - invariant word - length metric associated to some finite generating set , and we view every connected graph as a metric space by using the path - length metric ( see the next section for details ) .",
    "we point out that if @xmath3 acts translation - like on a finitely generated group or a graph @xmath6 , then for all @xmath9 the map @xmath11 is bilipschitz @xcite .",
    "thus , in the context of finitely generated groups and graphs one could equivalently define translation - like actions to be free actions by bilipschitz maps at bounded distance from the identity map .",
    "whyte s motivation in defining translation - like actions is that it serves as a geometric analogue of subgroup containment . specifically , we have the following proposition whose proof is trivial .",
    "[ subgroup action ] let @xmath1 be a finitely generated group and let @xmath12 .",
    "then the natural right action of @xmath3 on @xmath1 is a translation - like action .    in @xcite ,",
    "whyte suggested that conjectures relating geometric properties to subgroup containment may hold true if one requires a translation - like action in place of a subgroup .",
    "specifically , whyte mentioned the following three well known conjectures / problems .    1 .",

    "in this paper we answer ( 1 ) in the affirmative .",
    "[ intro thm bp ] every finitely generated infinite group admits a translation - like action by @xmath0 .",
    "we actually prove something stronger than both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "the main distinction of the following theorem , as opposed to theorems [ intro thm kw ] and [ intro thm bp ] , is the transitivity of the action .",

    "we define and consider a related weaker question : which groups are poly - mt ?",
    "of course , care needs to be taken in defining a notion of poly - mt as any tuple @xmath19 containing a singleton is a polytile . to rule out such trivialities ,",
    "one wants to consider tuples @xmath19 where the cardinalities of the @xmath28 s do not vary too much .",
    "the following definition seems to give the strongest restriction in this sense .",

    "a countable group @xmath1 is poly - mt if for every finite @xmath25 there is a fair polytile @xmath30 with @xmath31 .",

    "[ intro polymt ] every countable group is poly - mt . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath1 is a countably infinite non - locally finite group then for every finite @xmath25 and all sufficiently large @xmath32 there is a fair polytile @xmath30 with @xmath31 and @xmath33 .",
    "in addition to studying individual tilings , as chou and weiss did , we also study sequences of tilings as was done by gao ",
    "seward in @xcite .",
    "the following definition generalizes definitions appearing in @xcite to the context of polytilings .",
    "let @xmath1 be a countable group , and let @xmath34 be a sequence of polytilings .",
    "this sequence is _ fair _ if each of the @xmath35 s is fair .",

    "the three adjectives `` centered , cofinal , and coherent '' are abbreviated to _ ccc_.",
    "we point out that if a sequence of polytilings @xmath41 is ccc then every two elements @xmath42 lie in the same class of the partition induced by @xmath35 for all sufficiently large @xmath39 .",
    "also notice that a group is mt ( poly - mt ) if and only if it admits a cofinal sequence of monotilings ( fair polytilings ) . thus having a ccc sequence of monotilings ( fair polytilings )",
    "is stronger than being mt ( poly - mt ) .    in @xcite , gao ,",
    "jackson , and seward studied which groups admit a ccc sequence of monotilings .",
    "they called such groups _",
    "ccc groups_. they proved that the following groups are ccc groups : locally finite groups ; residually finite groups ; nilpotent groups ; solvable groups @xmath1 in which @xmath43 $ ] is polycyclic ; and groups which are free products of nontrivial groups .",
    "these are currently the only groups known to be ccc , and furthermore there are no known examples of groups which are not ccc .",

    "a countable group @xmath1 is _",
    "poly - ccc _ if it admits a ccc sequence of fair polytilings .",
    "notice that just as ccc is a stronger condition than mt , poly - ccc is a stronger condition than poly - mt .",
    "we prove the following .    [ intro polyccc ] every finitely generated group is poly - ccc .",
    "that is , every finitely generated group admits a ccc sequence of fair polytilings .",
    "interestingly , we do not know if countable non - finitely generated groups are poly - ccc .",
    "we point out that the proofs of these results on tilings rely heavily on the fact that every finitely generated infinite group has some cayley graph having a regular spanning tree ( theorem [ intro span ] ) .",
    "these theorems on tilings therefore demonstrate an application of this result .",
    "the organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec prelim ] below , we present formal definitions , notation , and some simple observations . in section [ sec ham ] , we study translation - like actions of @xmath0 which are transitive and we also study bi - infinite hamiltonian paths on graphs . in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ intro prop1 ] .",
    "we then use these findings in section [ sec bp ] to prove theorem [ intro thm bp ] ( the geometric burnside s problem ) as well as the first clause of both theorem [ transitive ] and theorem [ intro span ] .",
    "section [ sec span ] is devoted to strengthening the geometric von neumann conjecture as well as constructing cayley graphs having regular spanning trees . in this section",
    "we prove theorem [ intro prop2 ] and prove the remaining statements of theorem [ transitive ] and theorem [ intro span ] .",
    "finally , in section [ sec tile ] we study tilings of groups and prove theorems [ intro polymt ] and [ intro polyccc ] .",
    "this research was supported by a national science foundation graduate research fellowship .",
    "the author would like to thank khalid bou - rabee for helpful comments regarding an earlier version of this paper .",
    "in this section we go over some basic definitions , observations , and notation .",
    "a fundamental notion which will be used frequently is that of a bilipschitz map . if @xmath4 and @xmath44 are two metric spaces and @xmath45 is a function , then @xmath46 is _ lipschitz _ if there is a constant @xmath47 such that for all @xmath48 @xmath49 if we additionally have that @xmath50 for all @xmath48 , then @xmath46 is called _",
    "bilipschitz_. the metric spaces @xmath4 and @xmath44 are _ bilipschitz equivalent _ if there is a bijective bilipschitz function @xmath45 . finally , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are two metrics on @xmath6 , then they are called _ bilipschitz equivalent _ if the identity map @xmath53 is bilipschitz .",
    "notice that if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are bilipschitz equivalent metrics on @xmath6 then an action of @xmath3 on @xmath6 is translation - like with respect to the metric @xmath51 if and only if it is translation - like with respect to the metric @xmath52 .",
    "thus to discuss translation - like actions on @xmath6 , it suffices to specify a family of bilipschitz equivalent metrics on @xmath6 .",
    "this is particularly useful when @xmath54 is a finitely generated group .",
    "if @xmath1 is a finitely generated group , then we can specify a natural family of bilipschitz equivalent metrics on @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath55 be any finite generating set for @xmath1 , and let @xmath56 be the metric on @xmath1 given by @xmath57 ( where @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath60 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath56 is left - invariant , meaning that @xmath61 for all @xmath62 .",
    "we call @xmath56 the _ left - invariant word length metric _ corresponding to @xmath55 .",
    "all of the metrics @xmath63 are bilipschitz equivalent . to see this ,",
    "one only needs to consider expressing the elements of one generating set as products of elements of the other generating set .",
    "whenever discussing translation - like actions on a finitely generated group @xmath1 , we will always use the family of bilipschitz equivalent metrics just specified .",
    "most of our arguments in this paper rely on studying the structure of various graphs .",
    "we therefore review some notation and terminology related to graphs .",
    "let @xmath13 be a graph .",
    "we denote the vertex set of @xmath13 by @xmath64 and the edge set of @xmath13 by @xmath65 .",
    "the graph @xmath13 is _ regular _ if every vertex has the same degree , and it is _ even _ if the degree of every vertex is finite and even .",
    "a _ subgraph of @xmath13 _ is a graph @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "we write @xmath69 to denote that @xmath66 is a subgraph of @xmath13 .",
    "a subgraph @xmath66 of @xmath13 is _ spanning _ if @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath23 in @xmath13 is a sequence of vertices of @xmath13 such that vertices which are consecutive in the sequence are joined by an edge in @xmath13 .",
    "formally we represent @xmath23 as a function from a ( finite or infinite ) subinterval of @xmath0 into @xmath64 .",
    "if there is a smallest @xmath71 then we call @xmath72 the _ initial vertex _ or _ starting vertex _ of @xmath23 .",
    "if there is a largest @xmath73 then we call @xmath74 the _ final vertex _ or _ ending vertex _ of @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath75 , we say that @xmath23 _ traverses _ @xmath76 or _ visits _",
    "@xmath76 if there is @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 , we say that @xmath23 _ traverses _ the edge @xmath80 if there is @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83",
    ". a _ hamiltonian path _ is a path which visits every vertex precisely one time .",
    "these paths will be particularly important to us .",
    "a similar notion is that of an eulerian path . an _ eulerian path _ is a path which traverses each edge precisely one time .",
    "we realize the vertex set of every connected graph @xmath13 as a metric space by using the _ path length metric_. specifically , the distance between @xmath84 is the infimum of the lengths of paths joining @xmath85 and @xmath76 .",
    "if no metric is specified on a graph , then it is understood that we are using the path length metric .",
    "we say that two graphs are _",
    "bilipschitz equivalent _ if their vertex sets equipped with their respective path length metrics are bilipschitz equivalent . finally ,",
    "if @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we write @xmath88 to denote the union of @xmath89 with the set of all vertices @xmath75 which are within distance @xmath18 of some vertex of @xmath89 .    in this paper we will discuss translation - like actions not only on groups but also on connected graphs as well ( using the path length metric described in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "many times these graphs will arise in the form of cayley graphs .",
    "if @xmath1 is a finitely generated group and @xmath55 is a finite generating set for @xmath1 , then the right cayley graph of @xmath1 with respect to @xmath55 , denoted @xmath90 , is the graph with vertex set @xmath1 and edge relation @xmath91 .",
    "there is a symmetric notion of a left cayley graph where the edge set is @xmath92 .",
    "the left and right cayley graphs are graph isomorphic via the map @xmath93 . in this paper",
    "we will always use the term _ cayley graph _ to mean a right cayley graph @xmath90 where @xmath55 is a finite generating set for @xmath1 ( we never discuss or consider cayley graphs corresponding to infinite generating sets ) .",
    "if @xmath1 is a finitely generated group and @xmath94 is a finite generating set , then there are two corresponding metrics on @xmath1 : @xmath56 ( described earlier in this section ) and the path length metric coming from @xmath90 .",
    "it is easy to see that these two metrics are identical .",
    "thus we can freely and without concern switch between discussing translation - like actions on @xmath1 and translation - like actions on a cayley graph of @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we review the notion of the number of ends of a graph and of a finitely generated group . for a connected graph @xmath13 ,",
    "the _ number of ends of @xmath13 _ is defined to be the supremum of the number of infinite connected components of @xmath95 as @xmath89 ranges over all finite subsets of @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a finitely generated group , then it is known that all cayley graphs of @xmath1 have the same number of ends ( see for example ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section i.8 , proposition 8.29 ) ) .",
    "thus the _ number of ends of @xmath1 _ is defined to be the number of ends of any cayley graph of @xmath1 .",
    "finite groups have @xmath96 ends , and finitely generated infinite groups have either @xmath97 , @xmath2 , or infinitely many ends ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section i.8 , theorem 8.32 ) .",
    "in this section we focus on actions of @xmath0 on graphs which are both translation - like and transitive .",
    "the existence of such actions has a nice graph theoretic characterization , as the following lemma shows .",
    "[ bilip ham ] a graph @xmath13 admits a transitive translation - like action by @xmath0 if and only if @xmath13 is bilipschitz equivalent to a graph admitting a bi - infinite hamiltonian path .",
    "first suppose there is a translation - like action @xmath5 of @xmath0 on @xmath13 which is transitive .",
    "let @xmath51 be the path length metric on @xmath13 and let @xmath98 be such that @xmath99 for all @xmath75 ( notice that @xmath100 , but rather @xmath101 ) .",
    "let @xmath102 be the graph with vertex set @xmath64 and let there be an edge between @xmath103 and @xmath104 if and only if there is a path in @xmath13 of length at most @xmath39 joining @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "let @xmath105 be the path length metric on @xmath102 . then for @xmath106 @xmath107",
    "thus the identity map @xmath108 is a bilipschitz bijection between @xmath13 and @xmath102 .",
    "if we fix @xmath109 and define @xmath110 by @xmath111 , then @xmath23 is a hamiltonian path on @xmath102 ( since the action of @xmath0 is free and transitive ) .",
    "now suppose that there is a graph @xmath102 , a hamiltonian path @xmath112 , and a bilipschitz bijection @xmath113 .",
    "first define an action of @xmath0 on @xmath102 by setting @xmath114 for @xmath115 and @xmath109 .",
    "this action is free and transitive since @xmath23 is a hamiltonian path . also , it is clear that @xmath116 is at most distance @xmath39 from @xmath76 . therefore this is a transitive translation - like action of @xmath0 on @xmath102 .",
    "now we define a transitive translation - like action of @xmath0 on @xmath13 as follows . for @xmath115 and @xmath75 set @xmath117 since @xmath118 is bijective , this action is free and transitive .",
    "also , since @xmath118 is bilipschitz and @xmath119 is distance at most @xmath39 from @xmath120 , it follows that the distance between @xmath116 and @xmath76 is bounded independently of @xmath75 .",
    "thus this is a transitive translation - like action .    in the case of cayley graphs",
    "the previous lemma takes the following more appealing form .",
    "[ cayley graphs ] a finitely generated group @xmath1 admits a transitive translation - like action by @xmath0 if and only if @xmath1 has a cayley graph admitting a bi - infinite hamiltonian path .",

    "follow the proof of lemma [ bilip ham ] to get a graph @xmath102 having a hamiltonian path .",
    "now notice that @xmath102 is graph isomorphic to a cayley graph @xmath122 , where @xmath123 for some @xmath32 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath122 is a cayley graph of @xmath1 which has a hamiltonian path , then @xmath122 is bilipschitz equivalent to itself and so by lemma [ bilip ham ] admits a transitive translation - like action by @xmath0 .",
    "this clearly is also a transitive translation - like action of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "we now give a general sufficient condition for a graph to be bilipschitz equivalent to a graph admitting a bi - infinite hamiltonian path .",
    "let @xmath13 be a connected infinite graph whose vertices have uniformly bounded degree . then @xmath13 is bilipschitz equivalent to a graph admitting a bi - infinite hamiltonian path if and only if @xmath13 has at most two ends .",
    "first suppose that @xmath13 is bilipschitz equivalent to @xmath102 and that @xmath102 has a bi - infinite hamiltonian path .",
    "then @xmath102 contains the canonical cayley graph of @xmath0 as a spanning subgraph .",
    "any spanning subgraph must have at least as many ends as the original graph .",
    "so this implies that @xmath102 has at most two ends . since the number of ends of a graph is preserved by bilipschitz equivalence ( *",
    "* section i.8 , proposition 8.29 ) , @xmath13 has at most two ends .",
    "now suppose that @xmath13 has at most two ends .",

    "we will first construct a path on @xmath13 which will be very similar to a bi - infinite eulerian path .",
    "in fact , the path we construct will visit every vertex at least once and traverse every edge at most twice . in the construction",
    "we will use a theorem of erds , grnwald , and weiszfeld ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section i.3 , theorem 14 ) which says that if @xmath124 is a countably infinite connected multi - graph then @xmath124 admits a bi - infinite eulerian path if and only if the following conditions are satisfied :    1 .",

    "in other words , @xmath126 and for each @xmath127 @xmath102 has twice as many edges joining @xmath85 and @xmath76 as @xmath13 does .",
