    "restoring critical infrastructure in the aftermath of natural disasters or extreme weather events where water , power , and gas services may all be interrupted is one of the most important ways of limiting the impact of the disaster on society .",
    "our motivation for this work is drawn from situations where companies and governments need to restore _ interdependent infrastructure _ after major disruptions due to disasters and other forces .",
    "for instance , the electric company may be able to restore power lines to individual homes , but no electricity will flow until the gas company can supply gas to the main generator",
    ". once the power is flowing , the electric company receives its reward ( income ) from those customers receiving power . in order to pump water , power needs to have been restored and",
    "the water lines need to be repaired .",
    "each of these objectives are typically broken down into smaller tasks that restore availability to a subset of customers . in these settings , multiple agents ( also called players )",
    "are responsible for different services and may have conflicting interests : the power company may deploy its services in an order that maximizes reach to its subscriber base first , as opposed to undertaking repairs that allow another company to restart the water pumps .",
    "this paper formalizes a novel abstract model of this setting and studies the problem of finding a _ joint deployment schedule _ of services through a game theoretic lens , as players in this setting are independent decision makers .",
    "we consider classic questions such as welfare maximization , best responses , and the existence and computation of nash equilibria .    from the community s perspective",
    ", the overall goal is to reduce the size and length of the blackout .",
    "indeed , governments in the us plan for infrastructure restoration at a higher level than the individual company , e.g. , the state government or regional emergency management planning .",
    "however , when disasters become too large or individual companies refuse to cooperate with regional disaster management plans then companies might be unable ( or unwilling ) to obey global welfare considerations in restoring their infrastructure .",
    "@xcite and @xcite provide models that integrate the restoration planning and scheduling decisions to show that there is significant value in this integration as opposed to tackling both problems in a decentralized manner .",
    "our model of _ interdependent scheduling games _ ( isgs ) is a step towards understanding the impact of decentralized decision making in settings with interdependencies",
    ". other examples of isgsinclude coordinating multiple providers for humanitarian logistics over multiple regions , where roads need to be repaired before supplies can be delivered and tents must be erected before supplies can be distributed , or the coordination of interdependent supply chains which may involve ports , terminals , railway , and truck operators @xcite .    in our formalization",
    ", we consider a set of players , each of which has a set of servicesunder their control that need to be deployed .",
    "the individual players servicesmay have dependencies among each other and , crucially , may also be dependent on the status of other players services .",
    "in contrast to most traditional scheduling settings , where a task can not be scheduled unless all of its dependencies have been fulfilled , servicesin our setting can be deployed at any time , even before its dependencies have been deployed . however , a player only starts _ accruing reward _ for a service@xmath0 once all of its dependencies have been deployed as well . at this point , we say that @xmath0 has been _ activated _ and the player continues to gather reward for every time step in which the serviceis active . a typical reward in our setting would be collecting fees from utility subscribers who have had their service restored .",
    "* contributions . *",
    "we present a scheduling model with dependencies among servicesthat is suitable for scenarios in power restoration after natural disasters .",
    "we show that when there is only a single player , a welfare - maximizing schedule can be found in polynomial time . for more players ,",
    "welfare maximization becomes np - complete even with just two servicesper player .",
    "regarding game - theoretic solution concepts , we prove that in general , pure nash equilibria are not guaranteed to exist , and that it is np - hard to decide their existence . on the positive side",
    ", we consider a restricted setting where all serviceshave uniform ( equal ) reward and prove that a pure nash equilibrium always exists and can be computed in polynomial time .",
    "similarly , best responses can be computed efficiently but they need not converge to a nash equilibrium , even if rewards are uniform . for the uniform rewards case , we also give bounds for the price of anarchy and the price of stability .",
    "further , we provide an ilp formulation of the problem and demonstrate that , for generated data , we can find welfare maximizing schedules quickly .",
    "the problem of finding a schedule of tasks that maximizes the reward is an important question in scheduling , a classic area of computer science with many practical and important problems .",
    "most classical scheduling problems focus on allocating scarce resources to multiple tasks in order to maximize an objective function or minimize total time @xcite .",
    "in contrast to most of the scheduling literature , the dependencies ( or precedence constraints ) between the servicesin our model do not prevent the player from scheduling a servicebefore its prerequisites are fulfilled .",
    "instead , they keep the player from receiving _ reward _ from the serviceuntil the prerequisites are fulfilled .",
    "encouraging distributed agents , each of which may be responsible for only a small piece of a larger task , to work together to solve complex problems has a rich history in artificial intelligence and multi - agent systems research .",
    "scheduling distributed tasks in domains where agents are imbued with their own reward functions but are ultimately cooperative as they can jointly benefit from finding coordinated schedules , has been studied in a probabilistic setting by @xcite . additionally , _",
    "task oriented domains _",
    "@xcite , which typically involve multiple agents working together cooperatively , are a popular framework for investigating mechanisms and properties of multi - agent domains where agents either need to work together or negotiate over work to be accomplished . @xcite formalize the notion of strategic behavior when agents negotiate in task oriented domains .",
    "they provide a characterization of the type of lies ( e.g. hiding jobs ) and reward functions that admit incentive compatible mechanisms for a number of classic domains , though none of these classic domains involve scheduling with dependencies .",
    "we focus our analysis on game - theoretic issues such as best response dynamics and nash equilibria that are keenly applicable in settings such as ours where agents , trying to maximize independent utility , may or may not have explicit incentives to cooperate towards maximizing global welfare .",
    "scheduling domains in which players compete for common processing resources were introduced by @xcite   and @xcite .",
    "the most traditional approach in multi - agent scheduling is to consider a single centralized authority optimizing the whole domain .",
    "there have been a number of recent works focused on decentralized scheduling mechanisms . @xcite",
    "consider auction and bargaining models , which are useful when several players have to negotiate for processing resources on the basis of their scheduling performance .",
    "scheduling auctions typically divide the schedule horizon into time slots , and these time slots are auctioned among the players .",
    "the bargaining approach considers two players that have to negotiate over possible schedules .",
    "@xcite consider a two - player bargaining mechanism for any setting where the reward of one player does not depend on the actions taken by the other .",
    "their results hence apply to special instances of isgswith two players . for additional literature on mechanism design for non - cooperative scheduling games",
    "see , e.g , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "another related line of research is multi - agent project - scheduling . here",
    ", each project is composed of a set of activities , with precedence relations between the activities , and each activity belongs to an agent . each activity is associated with a minimum and a maximum processing time and agents have to choose a duration for all their activities . compressing",
    "the duration of an activity generates a cost to the agent , and an agents payoff is a fixed proportion of the total project payment , which depends on the project completion time .",
    "a mechanism design approach for multi - agent project - scheduling by @xcite proposes a decentralized mechanism using combinatorial auctions .",
    "recently , @xcite took a first step in analyzing game theoretical properties such as the existence and computation of nash equilibria as well as studying the price of anarchy in this setting .",
    "however , their setting significantly differs from that considered in this paper in that activities of the same agent can be processed in parallel and that all agents receive some fraction of the reward of a common production process .",
    "in contrast , we focus on agents involved in independent projects with separate objective functions , only related by precedence constraints between each other .",

    "if @xmath5 , then service@xmath0 will generate a reward only after service@xmath6 has been deployed.to be precise , at each time step @xmath22 , each player _ deploys _ exactly one service .",
    "in particular , we assume that every servicetakes exactly one unit of time to deploy .",
    "a servicewhich takes longer to deploy can be represented as a series of servicesdepending on each other where only the final servicegenerates a reward . for each service@xmath23",
    ", there is a _ reward _ @xmath24 , representing payment received or subscribers served in each time period that the serviceis active .",
    "we will sometimes consider the more restrictive case of _ uniform rewards _ where for all @xmath25 .    a solution for an isgis a schedule of all servicesin @xmath20 .",
    "as rewards are non - negative , players do not have an incentive to leave a gap between the deployment of two services .",
    "we can hence represent a _ schedule _ by a tuple @xmath26 , where each @xmath27 is a permutation of the services@xmath17 of player @xmath16 .",
    "this permutation uniquely determines the schedule for player @xmath16 and the position of a servicein the permutation denotes the time when it is deployed .",
    "a service@xmath0 is _ active _ during a time step if itself and all servicesin @xmath28 $ ] are deployed at or before that time step .",
    "we denote by @xmath29 the time when @xmath0 becomes active , i.e. @xmath30\\}$ ] . at each time step , all active services@xmath0 generate the reward @xmath31 .",

    "for ease of presentation , we omit arrows that are implied by transitivity of the dependency relation ; the full dependency graph is the transitive closure of the depicted graph .",
    "this representation is not completely unambiguous as a service@xmath0 is identified only by @xmath31 and the edges in @xmath36 .",
    "however , while indistinguishable ( subsets of ) tasks may exist , these can be interchanged within any particular outcome without effect .",
    "consider the following example .    both of the serviceswith reward @xmath37 belong to player 2 but depend upon a servicebelonging to player 1 . for schedule @xmath34 , @xmath38 as",

    "similarly , @xmath39 . for @xmath40 , @xmath41 while @xmath42 .",
