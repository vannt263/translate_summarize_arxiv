    "financial institutions , as banks and insurances , always consider portfolios of individual risks to evaluate their risk exposure .",
    "it is the reason why aggregated risks , modeled with random variables ( rv s ) , constitute the basis of internal models developed in those institutions , and are the focus of much investigation to evaluate at best their resulting distribution .",
    "+ in practice , when working on market risk data , e.g. on returns of financial assets which are known to be heavy tailed , it appears that the distribution of the yearly log returns of financial assets is often approximated by a normal distribution ( via the central limit theorem ( clt ) ) , assuming the aggregation of iid observations in the portfolio model . under this last assumption",
    ", there are two main drawbacks when using the clt for moderate heavy tail distributions ( e.g. pareto with a shape parameter larger than 2 ) .",
    "the first one is that , if the clt may apply to the sample mean because of a finite variance , it also provides a normal approximation with a slow rate of convergence ; it may be improved when removing extremes from the sample ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . moreover , even if we are interested only in the sample mean , samples of small or moderate sizes will lead to a bad approximation . improving the approximation would require to ask for the existence of moments of order larger than 2 .",
    "a second drawback is that , when working on heavy tailed aggregated data , the tail may clearly appear , e.g. on qq - plots , as heavy on high frequency data ( e.g. daily ones ) but may become not visible anymore when aggregating them in e.g. monthly or yearly data ( i.e. short samples ) , although it is well known that the tail index of the underlying distribution remains constant under aggregation .",
    "the figures on the s&p 500 returns illustrate very clearly this last issue , as we can see : +            the main objective of this study is to build the most accurate approximation for the distribution of aggregated risks when working on financial data under the presence of fat tail , not only for the mean but also for the tail behavior in order to obtain sharp evaluation of risk measures , and independently of the way we aggregate the risks .",
    "+ the first section will briefly review the existing methods , from the general central limit theorem ( gclt ) to extreme value theory ( evt ) methods , then present some properties of order statistics , known and new ones , useful to construct our method named _ normex_. this new approach , inspired by the work of zaliapin _ et al .",
    "_ s ( see @xcite ) , will be described in the next section and compared analytically with standard methods .",
    "finally we will apply on simulated samples the different methods , existing ones and normex , to compute extreme quantiles which are used as risk measures in solvency calculation .",
    "we will then compare numerically their accuracy .    with financial / actuarial applications in mind ,",
    "we use power law models , such as pareto , for the marginal distributions of the risks .",
    "note that this is also justified by the extreme value theory ( evt ) .",
    "limit theorems for the sum of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) random variables ( rv s ) are well known .",
    "nevertheless , they can be misused in practice and , as a consequence , lead to wrong results when applied to evaluate risk measures for aggregated risks . to help practitioners to be sensitive to this issue",
    ", we consider the simple example of aggregated heavy - tailed risks , where the risks are represented by iid pareto rv s , which is a natural frame for this study , as we are going to see .",
    "+ to aggregate risks implies a decrease of the sample size ( of the aggregated risks ) , hence comes the question of how reasonable it is to use a limit distribution as an approximation of the true distribution of the aggregated risks , and which type of approximation can be used for any sample size .",
    "first we review the existing methods to approximate the distribution of the pareto sum , from the general central limit theorem ( gclt ) to extreme value theory ( evt ) approaches .",

    "let @xmath11 be a random variable ( r.v . ) , pareto ( type i ) distributed with shape parameter @xmath12 and cdf @xmath13 defined by @xmath14 and pdf denoted by @xmath15 .",

    "+ we denote by @xmath22 the pareto sum @xmath23 , @xmath24 being an @xmath25-sample with parent r.v . @xmath11 and associated order statistics @xmath26 . + we will consider iid pareto rv s in this study .",
    "why pareto ?",
    "it is justified by the evt .",
    "indeed recall the pickands theorem ( see @xcite or e.g. @xcite ) proving that for sufficiently high threshold @xmath27 , the general pareto distribution ( gpd ) @xmath28 ( with shape parameter @xmath29 and scale parameter @xmath30 ) is a very good approximation to the excess cdf defined by @xmath31 $ ] : @xmath32 when considering risks under the presence of heavy tail , it implies that the extreme risks follow a gpd with a positive shape parameter @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , since , for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , for some constant @xmath35 , then it is natural and quite general to consider a pareto distribution for heavy tailed risks .",

    "condition is not too restrictive to keep interest to this study .",
    "again the evt provides an answer to this provocative question .",
    "indeed , it tells us that the tail index of the aggregated distribution corresponds to the one of the marginal with the heaviest tail , hence does not really depend on whether we consider the dependence or not .",

    "+      let us start by studying the behavior of the trimmed sum @xmath111 when writing down the sum @xmath22 of the iid @xmath12-pareto rv s ( with @xmath112 ) , @xmath113 , as @xmath114 much literature , since the 80 s , has been concerned with the behavior of trimmed sums by removing extremes from the sample ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ the main issue is the choice of the threshold @xmath110 , in order to use the clt but also to improve its fit since we want to approximate the behavior of @xmath111 by a normal one .",
    "we know that a necessary and sufficient condition for the clt to apply on @xmath111 is to require the summands @xmath79 , @xmath115 , to be @xmath116-rv s .",
    "but we also know that requiring only the finitude of the 2nd moment may lead to a poor normal approximation , if higher moments do not exist , as occurs for instance with financial market data . in particular , including the finitude of the third moment provides a better rate of convergence to the normal distribution in the clt ( berry - essen inequality ) .",
    "another information that might be quite useful to improve the approximation of the distribution of @xmath22 with its limit distribution , is the fisher index , defined by the ratio @xmath117 } { ( var(x))^2}$ ] , which is a kurtosis index .",

    "we attribute this to a numerical instability in the integration procedure used in r. indeed , for very large quantiles ( @xmath145% ) , the convergence of the integral seems a bit more unstable ( due to the use of the package vegas in r ) , which may explain why the accuracy decreases a bit , and may sometimes be less than with the max method . we plan to explore this problem further . * the max method overestimates for @xmath146 and underestimates for @xmath107 ; it improves a bit for higher quantiles and @xmath144 .",
    "it is a method that practitioners should think about , because it is very simple to use and gives already a first good approximation for the var ( as the clt does for the mean ) * the gclt method ( @xmath108 ) overestimates the quantiles but improves with higher quantiles and when @xmath25 increases * concerning the clt method , we find out that : * * the higher the quantile , the higher the underestimation ; it improves slightly when @xmath25 increases , as expected * * the smaller @xmath12 , the larger the underestimation * * for @xmath107 , the var evaluated with the normal approximation is always lower than the var evaluated via normex . the lower @xmath25 and @xmath12 , the higher the difference * * the difference between the var estimated by the clt and the one estimated with normex , appears large for relatively small @xmath25 , with a relative error going up to 13% , and decreases",
    "when @xmath25 becomes larger * we have concentrated our study on the var risk measure because it is the one used in solvency regulations both for banks and insurances .",
    "however , the expected shortfall , which is the only coherent measure in presence of fat tails , would be more appropriate for measuring the risk of the companies .",
    "the difference between the risk measure estimated by the clt and the one estimated with normex would certainly be much larger than what we obtain with the var , when the risk is measured with the expected shortfall , pleading for using this measure in presence of fat tails .",
    "the main motivation of this study was to propose a sharp approximation of the entire distribution of aggregated risks under the presence of fat tails , in view of application on financial or insurance data .",
    "in particular the aim was to obtain the most accurate evaluations of risk measures .",
    "there was still mathematically a missing brick in the literature on the behavior of the sum of iid rv s with a moderate heavy tail , for which the clt applies but with a slow convergence for the mean behavior and certainly does not provide satisfactory approximation for the tail .",
    "our study fills up this gap , by looking at an appropriate limit distribution .",
    "after reviewing the existing methods , we built _ normex _ , a method mixing a limit normal distribution via the clt and the exact distribution of a small number ( defined according to the range of @xmath12 and the choice of the number of existing moments of order @xmath133 ) of the largest order statistics .    in this study ,",
    "normex has been proved , theoretically as well as numerically , to deliver a sharp approximation of the true distribution , for any sample size @xmath25 and for any positive tail index @xmath147 , and generally better than what existing methods provide .",
    "an advantage of normex is its generality . indeed , trimming the total sum by taking away extremes having infinite moments ( of order @xmath148 ) is always possible and allows to better approximate the distribution of the trimmed sum with a normal one ( via the clt ) .",
    "moreover , fitting a normal distribution for the mean behavior can apply , not only for the pareto distribution , but for any underlying distribution , without having to know about it , whereas for the extreme behavior , we pointed out that a pareto type is standard in this context .",
    "normex could also be used from another point of view .",
    "we could apply it for a type of inverse problem , to find out a range for the tail index @xmath12 when fitting this explicit mixed distribution to the empirical one .",
    "other approaches have been proposed to estimate the tail index , which may be classified into two classes , supervised procedures in which the threshold to estimate the tail is chosen according to the problem ( as e.g. the mep  ( @xcite ) , hill  ( @xcite ) , or qq  ( @xcite ) methods ) and unsupervised ones , where the threshold is algorithmically determined ( as e.g. in @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "normex would be a new unsupervised approach , since the @xmath110 is chosen algorithmically for a range of @xmath12 .",

    "<S> basel ii and solvency 2 both use the value - at - risk ( var ) as the risk measure to compute the capital requirements . in practice , to calibrate the var , a normal approximation is often chosen for the unknown distribution of the yearly log returns of financial assets . </S>",
    "<S> this is usually justified by the use of the central limit theorem ( clt ) , when assuming aggregation of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) observations in the portfolio model . </S>",
    "<S> such a choice of modeling , in particular using light tail distributions , has proven during the crisis of 2008/2009 to be an inadequate approximation when dealing with the presence of extreme returns ; as a consequence , it leads to a gross underestimation of the risks . </S>",
    "<S> + the main objective of our study is to obtain the most accurate evaluations of the aggregated risks distribution and risk measures when working on financial or insurance data under the presence of heavy tail and to provide practical solutions for accurately estimating high quantiles of aggregated risks . </S>",
    "<S> we explore a new method , called normex , to handle this problem numerically as well as theoretically , based on properties of upper order statistics . </S>",
    "<S> normex provides accurate results , only weakly dependent upon the sample size and the tail index . </S>",
