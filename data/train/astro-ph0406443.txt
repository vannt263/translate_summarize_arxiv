    "tidal interactions between galaxies are suggested , both from observations and theory , to dramatically change the formation rates of field stars and globular clusters due to the tidal compression of gas clouds and their efficient conversion into stars ( kennicutt 1998 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; noguchi & ishibashi 1986 ; bekki & couch 2001 ; bekki et al .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) , which are the nearest pair of interacting galaxies in our vicinity , have served as unique laboratories for studying the interplay between galactic dynamical evolution and star formation activity in galaxies ( westerlund 1997 ; van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "a major curiosity in this context is that globular cluster formation  which is considered to be a special mode of star formation ( harris & pudritz 1994 ; elmegreen & efremov 1997 )  is observed to be ongoing in the clouds but not in the galaxy .",
    "clearly the physical conditions required for cluster formation currently exist in the clouds but not in the galaxy ( westerlund 1997 ; van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "moreover , the age distribution of the lmc clusters shows a gap extending from 3 to 13 gyr with only one cluster in this age range suggesting a second epoch of cluster formation started abruptly in the lmc about 3 gyr ago ( e.g. , da costa 1991 ; geisler et al .",
    "1997 ; rich et al . 2001 ; piatti et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the origin of the `` age gap '' , which has not been observed for the smc , has remained elusive so far ( e.g. , da costa 1991 ) .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to provide a new explanation for the origin of the mysterious age gap of the lmc s globular cluster system .",
    "the present study also tries to explain the latest observational results of the lmc s structural and kinematical properties ( e.g. , alves & nelson 2000 ; van der marel et al .",
    "we present here a new numerical model of the dynamical evolution and the star formation history of the lmc as it orbits the galaxy and is gravitationally influenced both by the galaxy and the smc , in an attempt to explain the origin of the age gap .",
    "we first determine the most plausible and realistic orbits of the clouds and then investigate the evolution of the lmc using fully self - consistent n - body models . in determining the orbits , we adopt the same numerical method as those in previous studies ( murai & fujimoto 1980 ; gardiner et al .",
    "1994 ; gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) , in which the equations of motion of the clouds are integrated backwards in time , from the present epoch until @xmath0 9 gyrs ago .",
    "figure 1 shows the best orbit model for the clouds calculated in this way , where it can be seen they experience a very close tidal encounter ( at a pericenter distance of 6.4 kpc ) around 3.6 gyr ago ( t@xmath1 ) and then become dynamically coupled . if dynamical friction between the clouds and the mass of the lmc ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) are considered  something which has not been done in previous studies ( e.g. , gardiner et al .",
    "1994 ) , then the present - day binary nature of the clouds can not have existed for a hubble time : they must have been separate objects in the past .",
    "using gas - dynamical n - body simulations ( bekki et al . 2004 ) , we investigate dynamical evolution and star formation histories of the lmc for the best orbit model .",
    "the lmc is modeled here as a bulgeless , gas - rich disk embedded in a massive dark matter halo with a mass 2.3 times larger than the disk mass , whereas the smc is treated as a point mass with the mass of @xmath4 @xmath3 .",
    "the exponential old disk of the lmc is taken to have a scale length of 2.6kpc ( kinman et al .",
    "1991 ) and a maximum circular velocity ( @xmath5 ) of 71kms@xmath6 , consistent with recent observations ( van der marel et al .",
    "the gas disk is represented by a collection of discrete gas clouds that follow the observed mass - size relationship ( larson 1981 ) .",
    "each pair of two overlapping gas clouds collides with the same restitution coefficient of 0.5 ( hausman & roberts 1984 ) .",
    "globular cluster formation in the present model is discriminated from field star formation as follows : the gas is converted into field stars according to the schmidt law with the observed threshold gas density ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "we use the cluster formation criteria derived by previous analytical works ( e.g. , kumai et al .",
    "1993 ) and hydrodynamical simulations with variously different parameters of cloud - cloud collisions on a 1 - 100pc scale ( bekki et al .",
    "2004 ) in order to model globular cluster formation .",
    "a gas particle is converted into a cluster if it collides with other high velocity gas ( ranging from 30kms@xmath6 to 100kms@xmath6 ) and having an impact parameter ( normalized to the cloud radius ) less than 0.25 .",
    "this model is strongly supported by recent observations ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2001 ) that have revealed that there is a tendency for young clusters to be found in gaseous regions with higher velocity dispersion , where cloud - cloud collisions are highly likely .",
    "chemical evolution of the gas with an assumed effective chemical yield of 0.005 is also incorporated in the simulations .",
    "our numerical results on field star formation histories in the lmc do not depend strongly on the above parameters of gas dynamics ( e.g. , gas mass fraction ) and star formation ( the exponent of the schmidt law ) for a reasonable set of parameters .    in the present paper ,",
    "we show only the results of the best model in which the clouds first came together about 4 gyr ago . it should be here stressed that this conjunction is not a unique characteristic of the best model : about 95 % of the orbital models have a disintegration of the lmc - smc binary  recall the integrations are done backwards in time  occurring within the last 4 gyr for models with the orbital parameters consistent with observations .",
    "we have investigated orbital evolution of the clouds for @xmath7 models with the current space velocities ( @xmath8,@xmath9,@xmath10 ) ranging from @xmath11 km s@xmath6 to @xmath12 km s@xmath6 for the clouds and thereby derived the epoch when the clouds become separated . we have confirmed that ( 1 ) it is highly unlikely that the clouds were a binary system more than 6 gyr ago , and ( 2 ) they most likely came together around 4 gyr ago .",
    "thus our main conclusions on the epoch of the commencement of cluster formation in the lmc do not depend so strongly on orbital parameters .",
    "as seen in figure 2 , the combined tidal effects of the smc and the galaxy distorts the lmc disk ( t=@xmath13 and @xmath14 gyr ) to form compact stellar and gaseous bars in its center after a few pericenter passages ( t=@xmath14gyr ) .",
    "consequently , young stars are formed repeatedly in the tidally compressed high - density gaseous regions , in particular the central bar , where the star formation rate is at a maximum at 0.38 @xmath3 yr@xmath6 .",
    "the tidal interaction significantly increase the degree of random motion of the gas clouds so that they collide much more frequently with one another .",
    "however , the cloud - cloud collisions with moderately high speed ( between 30 and 100 km s@xmath6 ) and small impact parameter ( @xmath15 0.25 ) , required for cluster formation , do not occur until the lmc begins to interact violently with the smc when the two are less than 10kpc apart ( t=@xmath16gyr ) . the dynamical evolution over the last @xmath0  3gyr results in about 0.5% of the initial gas cloud mass being converted into clusters .",
    "the new globular cluster system has a flattened , ` disky ' spatial distribution with nearly all clusters within the central @xmath0 3 kpc and confined within @xmath0 1 kpc from the lmc disk plane ( i.e. , an indication of a structure similar to the galactic thick disk ) .",
    "they are supported mainly by rotation with the central velocity dispersion of only 20 km s@xmath6 and with a fairly asymmetric radial dispersion profile caused by recent tidal interaction with the galaxy and the smc .",
    "the derived structure and kinematics of clusters are broadly consistent with the observed ones for intermediate - age clusters ( schommer et al .",
    "1992 ) . due to the rapid chemical enrichment associated with this star formation activity",
    ", the mean metallicity of clusters increase from [ fe / h ] = @xmath17 to @xmath18 over this period .",
    "such a recently formed cluster population consequently has a narrower age distribution than the new field stars ( figure 3 ) .",
    "thus the origin of the age gap and in particular the trigger for the most recent episode of globular cluster formation in the lmc may well be related to the commencement of strong tidal interactions between the lmc , the smc and the galaxy .",
    "the tidal interaction between the three may also play an important role in changing the structural and kinematical properties of the lmc .",
    "because of the strong tidal perturbation , the initial thin , non - barred disk is dynamically heated to form a thick , barred disk with an outer stellar warp .",
    "furthermore , @xmath19% of the stars in the disk are spatially redistributed to form an outer stellar halo with a velocity dispersion of @xmath20kms@xmath6 at a distance of 7.5kpc from the lmc center .",
    "the kinematically hot stellar halo is dominated by old stars with the fraction of new field stars equal to only 2% , because most halo stars originate from the outer part of the initial thin disk .",
    "in contrast , @xmath21% of the stars within the central disk are new field stars formed from the triggered star formation .",
    "for example , our simulations indicate that the half mass radius is @xmath22kpc for the old field populations and @xmath23kpc for the new populations ( i.e. , the different structure of the different aged populations ) .",
    "the stellar kinematics along the major axis shows the central velocity dispersion , @xmath24 , to be @xmath25kms@xmath6 with @xmath26 of @xmath0 2.3 .",
    "these results are broadly consistent with observations by van der marel et al .",
    "these also suggest that the lmc stellar halo has a significantly larger fraction of young , relatively metal - rich ( [ fe / h ] @xmath15 @xmath27 ) stellar populations compared with the galactic stellar halo dominated by very old , metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath0 @xmath28 ) stars .",
    "the origin of the field stars formed in recent star formation activity in the lmc disk is one of the most important problems associated with the formation of the lmc ( e.g. , butcher 1997 ; olszewski et al .",
    "1996 ; gallagher et al .",
    "our evolutionary model strongly suggests that such recent star formation is due to the repetitive tidal interaction between the lmc / smc and the galaxy .",
    "field star formation is more sensitive to tidal perturbation than cluster formation so that enhancement in field star formation can occur from the early evolutionary stage of the lmc ( i.e. , @xmath29 gyr ago ) .",
    "this can clearly explain why `` the age gap '' can be more clearly observed in cluster populations than in field ones .",
    "chemical enrichment associated with the tidally triggered star formation provides a natural explanation for the observed rapid increase of metallicity both in clusters and in field stars ( da costa 1991 ; dopita et al .",
    "1997 ) .    what then are the fossil records of any past dynamical interaction ?",
    "the tidal radius of the lmc , within which its stars are gravitationally bound , is linearly proportional to the pericenter of the orbit for the fixed masses of the lmc and the galaxy ( gardiner & noguchi 1996 ) .",
    "therefore , as the pericenter of the lmc orbit decreases as a result of dynamical friction , it loses an increasingly larger number of stars .",
    "figure 4 shows that the stripped stars in the simulation form a great circle - a relic stream in which the stars are diffusely and inhomogeneously distributed along the lmc s orbit in the galactic halo region . such a stream has been predicted in previous studies ( weinberg 2000 ) , but for the first time our simulations provide quite clear predictions on the spatial distribution and radial velocities of stars within the stream .",
    "ongoing and future surveys for stellar substructure in the galactic halo ( majewski et al .",
    "2000 ) will allow these predictions to be tested .",
    "indeed preliminary observational results have already suggested that the coherent radial velocity structures amongst giant stars in fields encircling the clouds are due to tidal debris that originated from the lmc ( majewski et al .",
    "how then can the model explain the observed different age distributions of clusters between the lmc and the smc ( piatti et al .",
    "we propose that such a difference can be understood in terms of the differences in the birthplaces and initial masses between the two .",
    "the lmc was formed as a relatively low surface brightness galaxy , being more distant ( @xmath30kpc , corresponding to the apocenter of its early orbit ) from the galaxy so that the galactic tidal field alone could not trigger cluster formation efficiently until it first encounters with the smc . in contrast",
    ", the less massive smc , which is therefore more susceptible to the galactic tide , was born less distant ( @xmath31kpc ) from the galaxy , and thus influenced by the galaxy strongly enough to form globular clusters from the early evolutionary stage ( several to 10gyrs ago ) .",
    "thus the difference in cluster formation histories could reflect the fact that the lmc / smc were formed as different entities rather than as a binary protogalaxy .",
    "tidal interaction between the clouds and the galaxy has long been considered to be a physical mechanism responsible for the formation of the magellanic stream and the evolution of the smc ( murai & fujimoto 1980 ; lin & lynden - bell 1982 ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that such interaction can also cause dramatic changes not only in the formation history of field stars and globular clusters but also in the lmc s structure and kinematics .",
    "our model predicts that if globular cluster formation is associated with a dramatic increase in the random motions in the lmc s interstellar medium , then the age- , metallicity- and spatial - distributions of these systems will be very much dependent on the orbital evolution of the clouds .",
    "this can be inferred observationally from radial velocity and proper motion measurements of their stars .",
    "future proper motion measurements with @xmath32micro - arcsec accuracy ( perryman et al .",
    "2001 ) , coupled with numerical simulations for different yet reasonable orbits of the clouds , will therefore enable us to obtain an integrated and systematic understanding of the formation of the lmc clusters .",
