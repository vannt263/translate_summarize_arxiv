    "entanglement is a unique phenomenon in quantum mechanics and it plays an important role in quantum - information processing and transmission . for instance , quantum computers exploit entanglement to speedup the computation of problems in mathematics @xcite .",
    "the two legitimate users in quantum communication  say , the sender alice and the receiver bob  use an entangled quantum system to transmit a private key @xcite or a secret message @xcite . also quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , controlled teleportation @xcite , and quantum - state sharing @xcite need entanglements to set up the quantum channel",
    ". however , in a practical transmission or the process for storing quantum systems , we can not avoid channel noise , which will make the entangled quantum system less entangled .",
    "for example , the bell state @xmath0 may become a mixed one such as a werner state @xcite : @xmath1 where @xmath2 here @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent the horizontal and vertical polarizations of photons , respectively .",
    "the bell state @xmath5 can also be degraded as a less pure entangled state like @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "multipartite entanglement states also suffer from channel noise .",
    "for instance , @xmath8 will become @xmath9 are called greenberg - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states .",
    "now , the multipartite entangled states like @xmath10 are also called multipartite ghz states .    the method of distilling a mixed state into a maximally entangled state is named entanglement purification , which has been widely studied in recent years @xcite . another way of distilling less entangled pure states into maximally entangled states that will be detailed here is called entanglement concentration .",
    "several entanglement concentration protocols of pure nonmaximally entangled states have been proposed recently .",
    "the first entanglement concentration protocol was proposed by bennett _",
    "et al _ @xcite in 1996 , which is called schmidt projection method . in their protocol @xcite , the two parties of quantum communication need some collective and nondestructive measurements of photons , which , however , are not easy to manipulate in experiment .",
    "also the two parties should know accurately the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the partially entangled state @xmath13 before entanglement concentration .",
    "that is , their protocol works under the condition that the two users obtain information about the coefficients and possess the collective and nondestructive measurement technique .",
    "another similar scheme is called entanglement swapping @xcite . in these schemes",
    "@xcite , two pairs of less entangled pairs belong to alice and bob",
    ". then alice sends one of her particles to bob , and bob performs a bell - state measurement on one of his particle and alice s one .",
    "so bob has to own three photons of two pairs , and they have to perform collective bell - state measurements .",
    "moreover , the parties should exploit a two - particle collective unitary evaluation of the quantum system and an auxiliary particle to project the partially entangled state into a maximally entangled one probabilistically .",
    "recently , two protocols of entanglement concentration based on a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) were proposed independently by yamamoto _",
    "et al _ @xcite and zhao _ et al _ @xcite .",
    "the experimental demonstration of the latter has been reported @xcite . in their protocol , the parties exploit two pbss to complete the parity - check measurements of polarization photons . however , each of the two users alice and bob has to choose the instances in which each of the spatial modes contains exactly one photon . with current technology ,",
    "sophisticated single - photon detectors are not likely to be available , which makes it such that these schemes can not be accomplished simply with linear optical elements .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity is a powerful tool to construct a nondestructive quantum nondemolition detector ( qnd ) .",
    "it also has the function of constructing a controlled - not ( cnot ) gate and a bell - state analyzer @xcite .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity was widely studied in the generation of qubits @xcite and the discrimination of unknown optical qubits @xcite .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearities can be described with the hamiltonian @xmath14 @xcite , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the creation operations and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the destruction operations . if we consider a coherent beam in the state @xmath19 with a signal pulse in the fock state @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote that there are no photons and one photon , respectively , in this state ) , after the interaction with the cross - kerr nonlinear medium the whole system evolves as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the interaction time . from this equation ,",
    "the coherent beam picks up a phase shift directly proportional to the number of photons in the fock state @xmath26 .",
    "this good feature can be used to construct a parity - check measurement device @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present a different scheme for nonlocal entanglement concentration of partially entangled multipartite states with cross - kerr nonlinearities . by exploiting a new nondestructive qnd",
    ", the parties of quantum communication can accomplish entanglement concentration efficiently without sophisticated single - photon detectors .",
    "compared with the entanglement concentration schemes based on linear optical elements @xcite , the present scheme has a higher efficiency and yield .",
    "moreover , it does not require that the parties know accurately information about the partially entangled states ",
    "the coefficients of the states  different from schemes based on two - particle collective unitary evaluation @xcite .",
    "these good features give this scheme the advantage of high efficiency and feasibility in practical applications .     and",
    "@xmath27 from @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "each polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) is used to pass through @xmath30 polarization photons and reflect @xmath31 polarization photons .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity will cause the coherent beam to pick up a phase shift @xmath32 if there is a photon in the mode .",
    "so the probe beam @xmath33 will pick up a phase shift of @xmath32 if the state is @xmath34 or @xmath27 . here",
    "@xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the up spatial mode and the down spatial mode , respectively.,width=226 ]",
    "the principle of our nondestructive qnd is shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is made up of four pbss , two identical cross - kerr nonlinear media , and an @xmath37 homodyne measurement .",
    "if two polarization photons are initially prepared in the states @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the two photons combined with a coherent beam whose initial state is @xmath40 interact with cross - kerr nonlinearities , which will evolve the state of the composite quantum system from the original one @xmath41 to @xmath42|\\alpha e^{i\\theta}\\rangle_{p } \\nonumber\\\\ & + & c_{0}d_{1}|hv\\rangle|\\alpha e^{i2\\theta}\\rangle_{p}+c_{1}d_{0}|vh\\rangle|\\alpha\\rangle_{p}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can find immediately that @xmath34 and @xmath27 cause the coherent beam @xmath43 to pick up a phase shift @xmath32 , @xmath28 to pick up a phase shift @xmath44 , and @xmath29 to pick up no phase shift .",
    "the different phase shifts can be distinguished by a general homodyne - heterodyne measurement ( @xmath37 homodyne measurement ) . in this way",
    ", one can distinguish @xmath34 and @xmath27 from @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "this device is also called a two - qubit polarization parity qnd detector .",
    "our qnd shown in fig.1 is a little different from the one proposed by nemoto and munro @xcite . with the qnd in @xcite , the @xmath34 and",
    "@xmath27 pick up no phase shift .",
    "however , it is well known that a vacuum state ( zero - photon state ) can also cause there to be no phase shift on the coherent beam .",
    "so one can not distinguish whether two photons or no photons pass through the two spatial modes .",
    "this modified qnd can exactly check the number of photons if they have the same parity .    ) and source 2 ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "the qnd is a parity - checking device .",
    "the wave plates @xmath46 and @xmath47 rotate the horizontal and vertical polarizations by @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively.,width=302 ]    with the qnd shown in fig.1 , the principle of our entanglement concentration protocol is shown in fig.2 .",
    "suppose there are two identical photon pairs with less entanglement @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the photons @xmath52 belong to alice and photons @xmath53 to bob . the photon pairs @xmath50 and @xmath51",
    "are initially in the following unknown polarization entangled states : latexmath:[\\ ] ] by measuring the @xmath110 photon with the conventional photon detectors , the @xmath110 parties will obtain a maximally entangled state @xmath124 if the number of parties who obtain a single - photon measurement outcome @xmath125 is even ; otherwise , they will obtain the maximally entangled state @xmath126 .",
    "here @xmath127 also works for improving the efficiency of a successful concentration of ghz - class states and the yield . in this time , one need only replace @xmath128 and @xmath129 in sec .",
    "[ iterationsection ] with @xmath130 and @xmath131 , respectively .",
    "compared with the entanglement concentration schemes @xcite by evolving the composite system and an auxiliary particle , the present scheme does not require the parties of quantum communication to know accurately information about the less entanglement states .",
    "this good feature makes the present scheme more efficient than those in refs .",
    "@xcite as the decoherence of entangled quantum systems depends on the noise of quantum channels or the interaction with the environment , which causes the two parties to be blind to the information about the state . with sophisticated single - photon detectors , entanglement concentration schemes @xcite with linear optical elements are efficient for concentrating some partially entangled states . with the development of technology , sophisticated single - photon detectors",
    "may be obtained in the future even though they are far beyond what is experimentally feasible at present .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity provides a good qnd with which a parity - check measurement can be accomplished perfectly in principle @xcite . with the qnd ,",
    "our entanglement concentration scheme has a higher efficiency and yield than those with linear optical elements @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we propose a different scheme for nonlocal entanglement concentration of partially entangled multipartite states .",
    "we exploit cross - kerr nonlinearities to distinguish the parity of two polarization photons . compared with other entanglement concentration schemes ,",
    "this scheme does not require a collective measurement and does not require the parties of quantum communication to know the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 of the less entangled states .",
    "this advantage makes our scheme have the capability of distilling arbitrary multipartite ghz - class states .",
