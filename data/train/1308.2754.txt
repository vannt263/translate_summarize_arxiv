    "stars formed in primordial gas clouds , turned on the light in a dark universe and strongly affected the subsequent evolution of the universe . thus following the dark age , the first stars , the so - called population iii stars , play important roles in the universe .",
    "the first star formed in the first collapsed object ( or minihalo ) at a redshift of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations have shown that the first collapsed objects had a baryonic mass of @xmath5 and a temperature of @xmath6k ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . until several years ago",
    ", it was thought that only a single massive star with a mass of @xmath7 forms in such an object ( see the review by * ? ? ?",
    "the formation of population iii stars has been studied mainly by numerical simulations because we can not directly observe them . to determine the properties of population iii stars , we need to understand the details of their formation . theoretically , the star formation process can be divided into two phases ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : the gas collapsing ( or prestellar ) and gas accretion ( or protostellar ) phases . the former covers the phase after the cloud begins to collapse , but before the ( first ) hydrostatic core forms .",
    "the latter phase is the period after protostar formation , during which gas accretes onto the protostar or the region near it .    by the use of one - zone or one - dimensional calculations , omukai and his collaborators investigated the formation of population iii stars in both the gas collapsing @xcite , and gas accretion @xcite phases .",
    "they showed that the thermal evolution of the primordial gas cloud differs considerably from that of present - day clouds in the gas collapsing phase .",
    "they also showed that in the gas accretion phase , protostellar radiation can not halt mass accretion onto the protostar and a high mass accretion rate lasts a long time .",
    "finally , they concluded that both high mass accretion and inefficient radiative feedback from the protostar produce a massive ( single ) population iii star with a mass of @xmath8 in the primordial cloud .",
    "multidimensional effects such as those of rotation , non - spherically symmetric accretion and magnetic fields are ignored in one - zone and one - dimensional calculations , although they should affect the formation of population iii stars . in reality , it is expected that , during the gas accretion phase , gas accretes onto a proto - population iii star through a circumstellar disk , and does not fall directly onto its surface . from an analogy to present - day star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", we can easily imagine that a high - mass accretion rate onto the circumstellar disk induces fragmentation and subsequent multiple star formation .",
    "in addition , even during the gas collapsing phase , a non - spherically symmetric collapse can induce fragmentation and subsequent binary formation @xcite .    using a three dimensional simulation",
    ", @xcite investigated the evolution of a collapsing primordial cloud with a simple initial setting and showed fragmentation before protostar formation ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently , starting from the cosmological setting , @xcite also showed the possibility of fragmentation during the gas collapsing phase .",
    "these studies imply that , in a primordial cloud , fragmentation during the gas collapsing phase causes the formation of a ( wide ) population iii binary .",
    "however , in these studies , the authors investigated only the cloud evolution before protostar formation ( i.e. during the gas collapsing phase ) because the calculation time step becomes increasingly short as gas density increases .",
    "thus , we can not calculate the cloud evolution for a long duration after protostar formation without any artifice .",
    "however , to determine how a population iii star forms in the first collapsed object , we need to calculate the cloud evolution even during the gas accretion phase .",
    "@xcite first focused on the evolution of a primordial cloud during the gas accretion phase following the gas collapsing phase by using a sink treatment and showed multiple fragmentation in the circumstellar disk after first protostar formation .",
    "then , by using sink particles or sink cells , many studies have confirmed multiple fragmentation during the gas accretion phase @xcite .",
    "all recent studies indicate that population iii stars are born in star clusters , as observed in present - day star - forming regions . in addition , although different sizes of sink radius ( or accretion radius ) were adopted in these studies , fragmentation always occurred .",
    "this implies that fragmentation occurs on any spatial scale in primordial clouds . to determine the minimum scale of fragmentation",
    ", we have to calculate primordial clouds without sinks .",
    "very recently , @xcite investigated primordial cloud evolution without sinks , and showed that fragmentation can occur even at a considerably small scale comparable to the protostellar radius .",
    "their results might mean that we have to calculate cloud evolution without sinks to investigate fragmentation and further evolution of primordial cloud and population iii stars .",
    "in addition to treating sinks differently , these studies differed in numerical settings such as the initial conditions ( cosmological setting or equilibrium sphere ) , thermal treatment ( barotropic equation of state or radiative cooling ) and chemical networks .",
    "although these differences produced slight quantitative differences in the results , such as the resultant stellar mass , number of fragments and fragmentation scale , fragmentation is never suppressed . when the mass accretion rate onto the circumstellar disk from the infalling envelope is larger than the mass flow rate to the protostar from the disk , the disk surface density ( or disk mass ) continues to increase , and the disk becomes gravitationally unstable to fragmentation @xcite .",
    "thus , fragmentation inevitably occurs in a primordial cloud which has a high mass accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , @xcite showed that the accretion luminosity of the primordial protostar does not substantially affect gas accretion .",
    "@xcite also showed that fragmentation can not be suppressed even when an unrealistically strong radiation field from primordial protostars is assumed .",
    "thus , accretion luminosity feedback from primordial protostars has a minimal effect on fragmentation or star cluster formation @xcite .    as a result",
    ", there is a consensus that fragmentation is a general occurrence and that multiple population iii stars form in a single primordial cloud .",
    "however , previous studies ignored the effects of the magnetic field .",
    "although the strength of the magnetic field is still controversial @xcite , the magnetic field may change the picture of fragmentation in collapsing primordial clouds .",
    "the magnetic field can effectively transfer angular momentum in the circumstellar disk by magnetic braking @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the magnetic field suppresses fragmentation in a primordial cloud during the gas collapsing phase .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated population iii star formation from realistic initial condition assuming an identical uniform magnetic field and pointed out that circumstellar disk formation tends to be suppressed in a magnetized collapsing primordial cloud during the gas collapsing phase .",
    "the effects of the magnetic field on population iii star formation during the gas collapsing phase were investigated in a few studies to date , whereas those during the gas accretion phase have not been studied with multi - dimensional calculations .",
    "this is because the magnetic field is incompatible with the sink treatment by which we can investigate the gas accretion phase . in the sink treatment ,",
    "the gas inside the sink radius is removed , whereas the magnetic field can not be removed because of the div@xmath9=0 constraint .",
    "thus , we need some other method to investigate the gas accretion phase with a magnetic field for a long duration .    in this study , following @xcite , which investigated the cloud evolution in the gas collapsing phase , we study population iii star formation in weakly magnetized primordial clouds , especially during the gas accretion phase .",
    "first , we model the relationship between protostellar mass and radius with a modified equation of state to realize long term calculation in the gas accretion phase .",
    "this modelling make it possible to treat the magnetic field even during the gas accretion phase without sinks .",
    "then , we calculate the evolution of an unmagnetized primordial cloud with a simple initial setting and compare our results with a recent highly developed simulation without sinks @xcite to validate our results .    finally , we calculate the evolution of weakly magnetized clouds and discuss the effect of the magnetic field on the formation of population iii stars , in which large - scale ordered magnetic fields parallel to the initial rotation axis are assumed .",
    "note that , however , some recent studies pointed out the possibility of generation of small - scale disordered fields ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , which can affect the disk formation and fragmentation in star forming clouds @xcite .",
    "we discuss the initial magnetic configuration and its effects in ",
    "[ sec : mag - config ] .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "the framework of our models and the numerical method are described in  2 , and the numerical results are presented in  3 .",
    "we discuss the calculation results , compare the formation of primordial stars with that of present - day stars in  4 and summarize our results in  5 .",
    "to calculate the evolution of primordial magnetized clouds before and after primordial protostar formation , we use three - dimensional resistive magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) equations , including self - gravity : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 denote the density , velocity , pressure , magnetic flux density , resistivity and gravitational potential , respectively . to self",
    "- consistently determine the thermal pressure and magnetic resistivity @xmath15 , we first calculated the thermal evolution by using a free - falling one - zone model starting from a hydrogen number density of @xmath17 and a temperature of @xmath18k , in which a non - equilibrium chemical reaction network in the primordial gas is solved .",
    "this calculation is basically identical to that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* primordial case ) , although we newly add the species of li , lih , li@xmath19 , li@xmath20 , lih@xmath19 , li@xmath21 , and li@xmath22 to the chemical networks , in addition to h , h@xmath23 , h@xmath19 , h@xmath24 , h@xmath25 , h@xmath20 , he , he@xmath19 , he@xmath21 , heh@xmath19 , d , hd , d@xmath19 , hd@xmath19 , d@xmath20 and e@xmath20 .",
    "although the newly included species do not significantly affect thermal evolution , they play a critical role in estimating the ionization degree and/or magnetic diffusivity ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the thermal evolution of the collapsing primordial gas is plotted against the gas number density as a solid line in figure  [ fig:1 ] . for reference , the thermal evolution for a solar metallicity gas @xcite",
    "is also plotted by as a dashed line in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "the thermal evolutions are almost the same as those in @xcite and @xcite . instead of solving the thermal evolution and chemical reactions in our three - dimensional calculation",
    ", we use the barotropic relation , which is denoted in figure  [ fig:1 ] by a dotted line ( for details , see  [ sec : psmodel ] ) .",
    "although we recognized that the long - term thermal evolution differs significantly from the one - zone model @xcite , we use the result of the one - zone model to focus on the effects of the magnetic field . note that we did not calculate the primordial cloud evolution for a very long duration ( @xmath26yr at best ) .",
    "almost the same barotropic relation was used in very recent study @xcite , in which the long - term evolution ( @xmath27yr ) of the accretion phase of population iii stars was investigated without magnetic field .",
    "the magnetic field plays an important role in the present - day star formation .",
    "while the magnetic field is amplified as the cloud collapses , in present - day clouds there is significant dissipation via ohmic diffusion once the gas reaches a density of @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "thus , we have to consider ohmic dissipation to investigate the magnetic evolution in present - day clouds @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the magnetic dissipation exacerbates the angular momentum problem but promotes disk formation , because it lowers the efficiency of the magnetic braking ( @xcite ; but , @xcite claimed that the ohmic dissipation rarely affects the disk formation ) .",
    "thus , we should investigate the evolution of the present - day cloud with the ohmic dissipation ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that other effects such as the disordered fields @xcite and turbulent reconnection @xcite possibly promote disk formation in a strongly magnetized cloud ( for details , see  [ sec : mag - config ] ) .",
    "instead , it is considered that the ohmic dissipation ( or magnetic dissipation ) is less effective in primordial collapsing clouds due to the high gas temperature and absence of dust grains ( see below ) .    with the one - zone calculation",
    ", we estimate the ionization degree and resistivity .",
    "the resistivity @xmath15 is estimated as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the speed of light .",
    "the electrical conductivity @xmath31 is derived using equations ( 41 ) and ( 43 ) in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) .",
    "the resistivity ( black lines ) and magnetic reynolds number ( red lines ) for primordial ( solid lines ) and solar ( broken lines ) metallicity gases are shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number in a collapsing cloud can be written as , @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the sound speed , gravitational constant and central density , respectively , and @xmath36 ( @xmath37 $ ] and @xmath38 ( @xmath39^{1/2}$ ] are the free - fall velocity and jeans length @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:2 ] shows that for the solar metallicity gas , the resistivity reaches a peak value at @xmath40 , and the magnetic reynolds number reaches re@xmath41 in the region of @xmath42 , where the magnetic field dissipates significantly . without the removal of the magnetic field , the solar metallicity cloud can not collapse further to form a protostar ( the so - called magnetic flux problem ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the ionization rate in the primordial gas cloud is considerably higher , and thus the resistivity is lower than those for the solar metallicity gas .",
    "this is because the primordial gas is hotter than the solar - metallicity gas ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and thermal ionization does not significantly lower the ionization rate .",
    "in addition , free electrons are effectively absorbed by dust grains as gas density increases and ionization rate decreases in the solar - metallicity gas , whereas the primordial gas does not contain dust grains @xcite .",
    "as a result , the resistivity of the primordial gas cloud is @xmath43 time higher than that for the solar metallicity gas in the range of @xmath42 , and the magnetic reynolds number never reaches re@xmath41 in the primordial cloud ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , even in a primordial gas cloud , the magnetic reynolds number is @xmath44 in the region of @xmath45 , where the circumstellar disk is expected to form .",
    "thus , the magnetic field can dissipate in this region in a primordial cloud .",
    "in addition , the magnetic reynolds number derived in equation  ( [ eq : magr ] ) is not applicable , especially in the gas accretion phase after first protostar formation .",
    "we roughly estimate the magnetic reynolds number with simple assumptions regarding the freefall velocity and jeans length .",
    "however , the rotation enables the infalling gas to remain around the primordial protostar for a longer duration .",
    "thus , ohmic dissipation is expected to be more effective in the gas accretion phase . because it is difficult to estimate the magnetic reynolds number in the accretion phase ,",
    "we need to calculate the dissipation of the magnetic field by resistive mhd calculations . adopting the gas pressure and resistivity shown in figures  [ fig:1 ] and [ fig:2 ]",
    ", we calculate the evolution of primordial gas clouds using equations  ( [ eq : cont])-([eq : grav ] ) .",
    "note that the ionization rate ( or resistivity ) in figure  [ fig:2 ] was derived using the one - zone calculation in the gas collapsing phase .",
    "thus , strictly speaking , it is not applicable for the gas accretion phase , in which the disk forms .",
    "however , we adopt it as an approximate indicator of resistivity .",
    "in reality , the magnetic dissipation by the ohmic dissipation is not significant in _ primordial _ clouds , as shown in @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is considered that a certain difference in the ionization degree does not qualitatively change the results . moreover , because we calculate the cloud evolution for a short duration after the first protostar formation , it is expected that the ionization rate in the gas accretion phase does not significantly differ from that in the gas collapsing phase .",
    "cosmological simulations have shown that the natal clouds for population iii stars have characteristic temperatures of approximately a few hundred k and densities of @xmath46 and are in an almost equilibrium state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to mimic this , as the initial condition we adopt the critical bonner - ebert ( be ) sphere , which is characterized by two parameters : the central density and gas temperature",
    "we set the central density to @xmath47 and the gas temperature to @xmath48k , which were derived by the one - zone calculation . with these parameters ,",
    "the initial cloud has a radius of @xmath49au ( 1.4pc ) .",
    "we enhance the density by a factor of @xmath50 to promote contraction , and the initial cloud has a mass of @xmath51 . in addition , to break the axisymmetry , non - axisymmetric density perturbations of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and 3 ( @xmath54 ) are added to the initial state .    although we initially assume a spherical cloud with characteristics similar to those seen in cosmological simulations , these initial conditions can be assumed to influence the results .",
    "however , the initial cloud properties except for the physical quantities at the centre of the cloud , affect the subsequent cloud evolution very little . after the cloud begins to contract , the gas undergoes a self - similar solution @xcite , in which the density profile is uniquely determined , independent of the initial cloud conditions @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial cloud conditions , such as density distribution and cloud shape , are not crucial to investigating the collapsing phase of primordial clouds and the early phase of protostellar evolution .",
    "this is natural because the evolution timescale of a cloud is given by the _ local _ free - fall timescale , which is proportional to @xmath55 .",
    "thus , only a central high - density cloud region first collapses ( or evolves ) , whereas the outer low - density region is left behind from the cloud evolution .",
    "therefore , the outer cloud region never affects the early phase of first protostar formation , which is the focus of this study .",
    "note that the outer low - density gas falls onto the protostellar system and affects the protostellar evolution with time .",
    "note also that , however , we can not calculate the cloud evolution for the long time period until the outer gas falls onto the centre of the cloud because we resolve the protostellar radius without sink cells ( see  [ sec : psmodel ] ) .",
    "@xcite investigated the evolution of magnetized primordial clouds and pointed out that only the magnetic field strength and rotation rate at the centre of the cloud determine the early evolution of protostars .",
    "thus , we also parameterize them in this study . in each model",
    ", the cloud rotates rigidly around the @xmath56-axis and a uniform magnetic field parallel to the @xmath56-axis is adopted in the entire computational domain . using a combination of two parameters , the magnetic field strength ( @xmath57 ) and rotation rate ( @xmath58 ) , we construct 14 models .",
    "they are listed in table  [ table:1 ] , which also lists the magnetic @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and rotational @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) energies normalized by gravitational energy , where @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the magnetic , rotational and gravitational energies of the initial cloud , respectively .",
    "in addition , we estimate the mass - to - flux ratio normalized by the critical value @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the critical mass - to - flux ratio @xcite . the normalized mass - to - flux ratio for each model is also listed in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "we adopted the magnetic field strengths of @xmath68 ; models 1 , 2 and 14 have no magnetic field ( unmagnetized models ) . because the strength of the magnetic field in primordial clouds is highly controversial",
    ", we adopt a wide range of magnetic field strengths .",
    "although it is also difficult to determine the rotation rate ( or rotational energy ) in primordial clouds , there are some indications .",
    "observations show that nearby molecular cloud cores have @xmath69 with a typical value of @xmath70 @xcite .",
    "cosmological simulations showed that the first - star - forming cores have @xmath71 @xcite .",
    "thus , the natal cloud of first stars are expected to have a non - negligible rotation rate . to limit the number of models , we adopt plausible values of the rotation rate , @xmath72s@xmath73 , @xmath74s@xmath73 and @xmath75s@xmath73 , which correspond to @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath79 adopted in this study roughly corresponds to the mean value of nearby molecular cloud cores , and is comparable to or somewhat smaller than that derived by cosmological simulations . in principle , it would be advantageous to study higher @xmath80 parameters , however such conditions are , at present , computationally challenging . as such , we limit the focus of this present study to the effect of the magnetic field in the presence of somewhat smaller initial rotational energies . to obtain the general picture of the population iii star formation , we have to calculate it in a wider parameter range or in various minihalos in future .",
    "to calculate spatial scales which differ considerably , we use the nested grid method ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "each level of a rectangular grid has the same number of cells , ( i , j , k ) = ( 256 , 256 , 32 ) , in which the cell width ( @xmath81 ) depends on the grid level @xmath81 .",
    "the cell width is halved with every increment of the grid level .",
    "the highest level of the grid changes dynamically to ensure the truelove condition @xcite , in which the local jeans length is resolved at least for eight cells . with this spatial resolution",
    ", we can properly investigate the fragmentation process in the collapsing cloud .",
    "note that while sufficient for resolving the fragmentation process in these systems , our current resolution is not sufficient for resolving the turbulent dynamo , and thus by implication , the turbulent cascade @xcite .",
    "we first prepare five grid levels : the initial cloud ( critical be sphere ) is immersed in the fifth level .",
    "we adopt a computational boundary 32 times larger than the initial cloud radius to safely calculate the evolution of a magnetized cloud .",
    "this treatment can prevent the reflection of alfv@xmath82n waves at the computational boundary ( for details , see @xcite ) .",
    "the fifth level of grid has a box size of @xmath83au ( 2.76pc ) with a cell width of @xmath84au , whereas the first level of grid has @xmath85au ( 44.16pc ) and @xmath86au .",
    "the maximum level of grid is set to @xmath87 with @xmath88au and @xmath89au .",
    "thus , we can cover the structures of both the natal cloud ( @xmath90 pc ) and the protostar ( @xmath91au ) .",
    "after the first protostar forms or the @xmath87 grid is generated , we stop the generation of new finer grid levels .",
    "however , we confirmed that truelove condition was always fulfilled in both @xmath92 and @xmath93 grids ( see ,  [ sec : psmodel ] ) .",
    "when fragmentation occurs , several fragments are ejected from the @xmath92 grid by gravitational interaction long after first protostar formation , and the truelove condition is violated in such fragments , which are located in the @xmath94 grid .",
    "note that @xmath92 has a box size of @xmath95au .",
    "we do not trace fragments after they are ejected from the central region or @xmath92 grid ( see  [ sec : unmanetized ] ) .",
    "in addition , such small fragments are not expected to significantly affect the dynamical evolution and fragmentation around the centre of the cloud .    in this study ,",
    "finer rectangular grids are fixed to the center of the collapsing cloud ( or the center of coarser grids ) .",
    "thus , we can not trace a long - term evolution of the disk because the high - density gas region that corresponds to the disk expands with time and the jeans condition is finally violated in a coarser grid .",
    "note that the disk size progressively increases because the gas accreted later has a larger angular momentum .",
    "for this study , however , the disk and fragmentation region were limited only in l=20 and 21 grids and the jeans condition was fulfilled in these grids by the end of the calculation , and thus we could safely calculate the disk evolution and fragmentation . to calculate the disk evolution for a longer time , we require another technique such as adaptive mesh refinement .",
    "a population iii star gradually increases its radius in the early evolutionary stage .",
    "the radius of proto - population iii star is @xmath96 at its formation and increases as the protostellar mass increases because the high mass accretion rate with high entropy causes the protostar to swell .",
    "@xcite calculated the protostellar evolution with a constant accretion rate of @xmath97yr@xmath73 .",
    "they showed that the protostar has a radius of @xmath98 when it has a mass of @xmath99 and the protostellar radius increases roughly as @xmath100 ( the adiabatic accretion phase ; see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the protostar has a radius of @xmath101 when the protostellar mass reaches @xmath102 .",
    "then , for @xmath103 , the protostar enters in the kelvin - helmholtz contraction phase and begins to contract .    to investigate the circumstellar disk formation and fragmentation process in multi - dimensional calculations , the sink cell approach is often used to realize a long - term calculation during which the sink radius ( or accretion radius ) is usually fixed . in present - day star formation , the ( rotating ) first adiabatic core forms with a size of @xmath104au @xcite before protostar formation .",
    "after protostar formation , the first adiabatic core becomes the circumstellar disk @xcite , and fragmentation occurs at the scale of the first core ( @xmath105au ) . as a result , the first adiabatic core gives the typical scale of disk formation and fragmentation .",
    "in addition , during the main accretion stage , the protostellar radius remains almost constant at @xmath106 ( or @xmath107 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is deeply embedded in the disk ( or the remnant of the first adiabatic core ) , which has a size of @xmath108au @xcite .",
    "therefore , in present - day star formation , we need a spatial scale of @xmath109au to investigate disk formation and fragmentation . in other words",
    ", we can replace the region inside @xmath110au with a sink .",
    "in contrast , in a primordial collapsing cloud , there is no typical spatial scale .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig:1 ] , before protostar formation ( @xmath111 ) , the gas temperature gradually increases with a polytropic index @xmath112 for the primordial cloud @xcite , whereas it suddenly increases at @xmath113 and gives the typical scale for the solar metallicity cloud @xcite .",
    "therefore , unlike the solar metallicity case , no adiabatic core forms before protostar formation in primordial collapsing cloud .",
    "thus , it is expected that the circumstellar disk gradually grows , and fragmentation occurs near the protostar .",
    "note that in the solar metallicity case , a disk - like structure ( i.e. the first adiabatic core ) with a scale of @xmath105au exists even before protostar formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , as described above , the protostellar radius changes drastically from @xmath114 to @xmath115au in the range of @xmath116 .",
    "thus , as the protostar grows , it may swallow the circumstellar disk or fragments . in any case , to study the disk formation and fragmentation processes , we need to resolve the region near the protostar and protostar itself ( or protostellar radius ) without a sink . to investigate the effect of the sink , we calculated the evolution of rotating or non - rotating primordial gas clouds with different sink radii in advance ( see the appendix ) and confirmed that fragmentation always occurs with a scale several times larger than the sink radius ( or the accretion radius ) .",
    "this indicates that the sink radius artificially yields the fragmentation scale and controls the evolution after protostar formation ( or after sink creation ) .",
    "note that when protostellar feedback is taken into account with radiative transfer , fragmentation scale is considered to be controlled by it @xcite .",
    "thus , the fragmentation scale without protostellar feedback is expected to differ from that with it .",
    "moreover , we can not calculate a magnetized cloud without effective magnetic dissipation , as described in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] . in summary",
    ", we have to calculate the cloud evolution without a sink , resolving the protostellar radius .    however ,",
    "when we resolve the inner structure of the protostar , we can not calculate the cloud evolution for a long - duration after protostar formation .",
    "this is because the calculation time step becomes extremely small when resolving the protostar , as seen in @xcite . to realize a long - term calculation after protostar formation",
    ", we construct a protostellar model in which the protostellar radius is related to the protostellar mass .",
    "as described in @xcite , the protostellar mass can be related to the protostellar radius when the mass accretion rate is given .",
    "first , to estimate the mass accretion rate , we prepared a non - rotating primordial cloud ( model 1 ; see table  [ table:1 ] ) and calculated its evolution with a sink , where the accretion radius is @xmath117au is adopted ( model s1 ; for details , see appendix ) .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] plots the mass accretion rate against the protostellar mass , in which the mass accretion rate is calculated with the accretion gas onto the sink .",
    "this figure shows that the mass accretion rate is in the range of @xmath118 with an average of @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "then we calculated the evolution of the same cloud ( model 1 ) without a sink , but changed the thermal evolution ( or gas pressure ) in the range of @xmath121 .",
    "we used the thermal evolution derived by the one - zone calculation described in  [ sec : basic ] for @xmath122 , whereas we adopted an artificially constructed polytropic relation for @xmath123 .",
    "we constructed 30 different polytropic relations and checked the relationship between the protostellar mass and radius for each one .",

    "then , with this harder equation of state , the adiabatic core ( or protostar ) swells as the mass increases because the central region can not collapse further . among the 30 polytropic relations ( or 30 different calculations ) , we choose the most plausible one which well describes the mass - radius relation for the primordial protostar shown in @xcite .",

    "figure  [ fig:5 ] shows the radial distribution of the density ( upper panel ) and velocity ( lower panel ) at the same epochs as in figure  [ fig:4 ] .",

    "a jet appears in model 3 , which has the strongest magnetic field among the models , although it weakens and disappears in several tens of years after protostar formation .",
    "in addition , models 6 , 7 and 8 show no jet during the calculation because the weak magnetic field can not drive it .",
    "on the other hand , models 4 and 5 continue to show a powerful jet by the end of the calculation .    figure  [ fig:16 ] plots the structure of the jet at @xmath189yr for model 4 . for this model ,",
    "a jet appears immediately after protostar formation .",
    "the magnetic field lines are strongly twisted by the rotation of the protostar , and drive a well - collimated jet .",
    "the jet has a maximum velocity of @xmath190 , which roughly corresponds to the kepler velocity when the protostar has a mass of @xmath191 and a radius of @xmath192 .",

    "however , there are some theoretical implications .",
    "recent studies claimed that the accretion shock onto the first star - forming halo can create turbulence which generates weak seed magnetic fields being amplified by the small - scale dynamo ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , to investigate the star formation in the early universe , we may have to adopt small - scale disordered fields in turbulent clouds according to the latest theoretical prediction .",
    "when the disordered fields are adopted , local magnetic field lines are not aligned with the local rotation axis .",
    "in such a case , the cloud evolution somewhat differs from that in the aligned case @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the disk formation when the global magnetic fields are misaligned to the global rotation axis and pointed out that misaligned fields weaken the efficiency of the magnetic braking and promote disk formation ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite calculated the evolution of turbulent cloud with global ordered fields and showed the suppression of fragmentation during the early phase of the star formation .",
    "@xcite calculated the cloud evolution with almost the same setting as in @xcite and claimed that the magnetic braking efficiency is reduced due to the absence of a coherent rotation structure around the center of the collapsing cloud , which is caused by turbulence .",
    "in addition , turbulent reconnection may also weaken the magnetic effects on the disk formation @xcite .",
    "thus , it is expected that disordered small scale fields alleviate the effect of the magnetic field or efficiency of magnetic braking . in this study , we adopted ordered global fields as a first attempt at the problem , and will postpone the investigation of disordered fields to a later paper .",
    "the magnetic field affects the environment around protostar because it suppresses disk formation and fragmentation and drives the protostellar jet . to investigate the effect of the magnetic field on protostellar growth",
    ", the mass of the primary star for models 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 and 8 is plotted against the elapsed time after primary star formation in figure  [ fig:18 ] .",
    "the primary star corresponds to a most massive clump that has a maximum density of @xmath123 (  [ sec : unmanetized ] ) , and the mass of the primary star is calculated integrating the gas in the region of @xmath123 .",
    "the figure shows that the difference in the primary stellar mass among the models is within a factor of @xmath203 .",
    "this indicates that the magnetic field has little effect on the mass accretion rate onto the primary star . in present - day star formation , mass accretes onto the protostar through the circumstellar disk .",
    "thus , the mass accretion rate is strongly related to the condition ( or viscosity ) of the circumstellar disk . on the other hand",
    ", no clear circumstellar disk appears in a primordial cloud .",
    "when the initial cloud is unmagnetized , fragmentation frequently occurs and fragments break up the disk . in addition ,",
    "when the initial cloud is magnetized , the magnetic field effectively transfers the angular momentum , and no disk forms . as a result , gas accretes directly onto the protostar from the infalling envelope .",
    "the density profile of the collapsing prestellar cloud , which roughly corresponds to the infalling envelope after protostar formation , is described well with a simple self - similar solution even with rotation and a magnetic field as described in  [ sec : initial ] .",
    "thus , it is natural that the models exhibit almost the same mass accretion rate . in an unmagnetized cloud",
    ", the protostar also acquires mass from clump mergers and loses mass by mass exchange , as described in ",
    "[ sec : unmanetized ] .",
    "however , figure  [ fig:18 ] indicates that mergers and mass exchange do not contribute greatly to the mass evolution of the primary star .    as described in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , many clumps appear in the unmagnetized cloud , whereas only a single protostar appears in the magnetized cloud . however , the primary star has almost the same mass in any model .",
    "in addition , the mass accretion rate of the primary star for all models is as high as @xmath204 during the calculations .",
    "moreover , the primordial cloud has sufficient mass to supply the protostar in further evolutionary stages .",
    "although mass accretion finally stops owing to protostellar feedback @xcite , a massive protostar of @xmath205 is expected to appear in both unmagnetized and magnetized primordial clouds .",
    "in addition , when fragmentation frequently occurs in the disk , `` fragmentation induced starvation '' limits the protostellar mass evolution @xcite .",
    "@xcite calculated the massive star formation in a massive cloud .",
    "they pointed out that the accretion onto the central star is shut off by disk fragmentation and the formation of lower - mass companions that can intercept the inward mass accretion . in our calculation , the protostellar mass continues to increase for at least @xmath90100yr after the first protostar formation .",
    "however , in a further evolutionary stage , the growth rate of the protostellar mass may decrease by this mechanism . to determine the final stellar mass , we need to calculate the cloud evolution for a longer time .        in this study , we calculated the evolution of primordial clouds and investigated the star formation process in the main accretion stage . in the calculations ,",
    "fragmentation frequently occurs when the primordial cloud is unmagnetized or very weakly magnetized , whereas no fragmentation occurs when it is ( strongly ) magnetized .",
    "consequently , many stars and substellar companions appear in the former case , whereas only a single massive star appears in the latter case . these features of star formation in primordial clouds differ in several aspects from those in present - day clouds .",
    "it is useful to clarify the difference in the star formation process between primordial and present - day clouds .    in present - day clouds",
    ", gas evolves almost isothermally for @xmath206 .",
    "after the gas becomes optically thick toward dust thermal emission at @xmath207 , it evolves adiabatically for @xmath208 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) , and the first adiabatic core forms .",
    "next , the density increases very slowly because a quasi - equilibrium state is realized .",
    "thus , the first adiabatic core has enough time to develop the perturbations which cause fragmentation .",
    "note that , without turbulence , because the gas collapses very rapidly and there is not enough time to develop perturbations before the first adiabatic core forms , fragmentation does not occur unless the molecular cloud core is extremely distorted @xcite . note also that , with turbulence , fragmentation can occur even in the isothermal collapsing phase @xcite . as a result , without turbulence ,",
    "fragmentation can occur on the scale of a first core which is 10 - 100au in size .",
    "then , the protostar forms @xmath209yr after first core formation .",
    "the first core ( or the remnant of the first core ) remains after protostar formation and becomes the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "thus , the circumstellar disk has a size of @xmath210au at the protostar formation epoch . during the main accretion phase",
    ", fragmentation occurs in the outer region of the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , fragmentation rarely occurs at @xmath211au before and after protostar formation . in summary",
    ", fragmentation occurs at @xmath212au in present - day star formation .",
    "thus , we may introduce a sink with an accretion radius of @xmath213au .",
    "on the other hand , the gas pressure ( or temperature ) gradually increases with @xmath214 ( @xmath215 ) and @xmath216 in primordial clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) . unlike the case in present - day clouds , in the primordial clouds , no adiabatic core forms before protostar formation because the adiabatic index @xmath217 never exceeds @xmath218 until the protostar formation . however , fragmentation can occur in the collapsing primordial cloud because there is no analytical solution in a rotating cloud with a polytropic index of @xmath219 @xcite .",
    "note that there exists a self - similar solution with @xmath220 , in which no fragmentation occurs because the gas collapses according to the solution .",
    "although fragmentation manages to occur before protostar formation @xcite , it easily occurs after protostar formation because the gas collapse stops and the perturbations necessary for fragmentation can develop . because the dynamical timescale ( free - fall timescale or rotation timescale ) is short near the protostar , fragmentation tends to occurs near the protostar in the early phase of star formation .",
    "in addition , gas with a lower angular momentum , which has a smaller centrifugal radius @xcite , first falls near the protostar and contributes to fragmentation . in reality , as seen in figure  [ fig:6 ] , fragmentation occurs only near the primary protostar , at least during the early gas accretion phase .",
    "note that fragmentation may not occurs in the very proximity of the protostar , because the accretion luminosity heating , which is not considered in this study , can suppress fragmentation in such a region after the protostar becomes sufficiently massive @xcite .    in summary , for the primordial case",
    ", only the ( primary ) protostar can give a typical scale for fragmentation because there is no typical scale in the collapsing cloud with an adiabatic index of @xmath219 .",
    "if a sink cell is introduced in the primordial cloud , the sink radius ( or accretion radius ) becomes the typical scale for fragmentation , and fragmentation occurs artificially with the sink radius , as described in the appendix .",
    "thus , we can not use a sink for the primordial star formation process . on the other hand",
    ", we may use it for present - day star formation because the typical scale appears before protostar formation with the first adiabatic core .",
    "@xcite pointed out that , in primordial clouds , fragmentation does not occur in the range of @xmath221 , with which we can estimate the typical fragmentation scale ( or jeans length ) of @xmath222au .",
    "thus , we may investigate fragmentation with the sink accretion radius of @xmath223au .",
    "note that we need to be slightly careful when using a sink ( particle ) implementation , since the protostellar radius changes from 0.1au to 1au as the protostar evolves .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the protostellar system ( circumstellar disk and protostar ) differs considerably between primordial and present - day clouds : the mass accretion rate is @xmath224 for primordial clouds , whereas it is @xmath225 for present - day clouds .",
    "thus , in the primordial cloud , the disk surface density fluctuates over a short time period .",
    "the surface density is directly related to the gravitational instability and fragmentation .",
    "the gravitational instability of the disk is described using toomre s q parameter , which is defined as @xmath226 where @xmath227 and @xmath228 are the epicyclic frequency and surface density , respectively .",
    "the high mass accretion rate rapidly increases the disk surface density , and the denominator of equation  ( [ eq : toomre ] ) increases .",
    "then , @xmath229 becomes as small as @xmath230 , and gravitational instability or fragmentation occurs .",
    "assuming a disk mass of @xmath231 and a disk mass accretion rate of @xmath232 for the primordial case and @xmath233 for the present - day case , the disk growth timescale is @xmath234 in addition , the keplerian timescale is described as @xmath235 as seen in figure  [ fig:6 ] , fragmentation occurs at @xmath236au in primordial clouds . when @xmath237au ( or 1au ) and @xmath238 are substituted into equation  ( [ eq : kepler ] ) ,",
    "the keplerian timescale is @xmath239yr ( or 1yr ) .",
    "for present - day cloud , the keplerian timescale @xmath240yr at 1 - 5au is much shorter than the disk growth timescale @xmath241yr . in this case",
    ", the disk may adjust itself by developing a spiral structure which can transfer its angular momentum and redistribute surface density .",
    "when the spiral structure can not transfer sufficient angular momentum , fragmentation may occur .",
    "in addition , the cooling timescale should be taken into account @xcite because the denominator ( or sound speed ) in equation  ( [ eq : toomre ] ) also changes on a timescale of @xmath242yr ( @xmath243 ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "on the other hand , for primordial clouds , the keplerian timescale @xmath244yr is longer than or comparable to the disk growth timescale , @xmath245yr .",
    "hence , fragmentation is unavoidable because the disk grows before it can redistribute its angular momentum and surface density .",
    "note that the cooling timescale is much longer than either the keplerian or disk growth timescale . as a result , at a higher mass accretion rate ,",
    "fragmentation tends to occur in primordial clouds .",
    "a magnetic field impedes disk formation .",
    "the disk is supported by rotation , and its angular momentum is transferred by magnetic braking .",
    "thus , when the magnetic field effectively transfers the angular momentum outward , no disk forms around the protostar . in present - day star formation , two processes ( magnetic dissipation and a limited mass reservoir ) make disk formation possible , overcoming the magnetic braking catastrophe @xcite .    for present - day collapsing clouds , the magnetic field in the high - density gas region effectively dissipates by ohmic dissipation with a much lower ionization degree .",
    "the magnetic dissipation weakens the efficiency of angular momentum transfer by magnetic braking .",
    "however , it requires appreciable time to dissipate the magnetic field .",
    "the first core ( the first core remnant ) , which exists for @xmath246yr even after protostar formation , plays a crucial role for the ohmic dissipation @xcite . because the infalling gas stays in the first core ( remnant ) for a long time",
    ", the magnetic field in the first core can dissipate , and a rotation - supported disk forms .",
    "in addition , as the infalling envelope dissipates , magnetic braking becomes ineffective , and the disk grows .",
    "note that for magnetic braking to occur , the infalling envelope must have sufficient mass because angular momentum is transferred into the infalling envelope , which can brake the disk .    on the other hand ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] , ohmic dissipation is not so effective in primordial clouds . if the gas can stay in the disk , ohmic dissipation may decrease the magnetic field strength . however ,",
    "the disk ( or first core ) does not form in primordial clouds .",
    "thus , gas can not stay in the circumstellar region without dissipation of the magnetic field , and angular momentum is effectively transferred by magnetic braking .",
    "in addition , because the primordial cloud has a sufficient mass of @xmath247 , the infalling envelope is not depleted . such a massive infalling envelope can continue to brake the disk ( or transfer angular momentum outward ) even long after protostar formation .",
    "note that , however , as the protostar becomes massive enough , the infalling envelope may be dissipated by protostellar feedback . in summary ,",
    "the magnetic braking catastrophe in primordial clouds is more serious than that in present - day clouds .",
    "thus , a rotation - supported disk can not form when a primordial cloud is magnetized .",
    "in this study , we investigated the accretion phase of population iii star formation in magnetized and unmagnetized primordial clouds .",
    "first , to make a long - term calculation after protostar formation possible , we constructed a protostellar model by adjusting the equation of state , which relates the protostellar mass to the protostellar radius .",
    "then , we calculated the evolution of primordial magnetized and unmagnetized clouds for several hundreds of years after first protostar formation .",
    "our calculations yielded the following results .    * * multiple fragments and stellar clusters in unmagnetized clouds * + in unmagnetized clouds , fragmentation frequently occurs after the formation of the first protostar , which becomes the primary ( or most massive ) star .",
    "a disk - like structure appears just after first protostar formation , whereas it fragments into several clumps .",
    "thus , although the infalling gas tends to form a disk - like structure around the primary star , prompt fragmentation breaks up the disk .",
    "the mass accretion rate in primordial clouds is as high as @xmath248yr@xmath73 , which is about 3  4 orders of magnitude higher than that in present - day clouds . with this high mass accretion rate ,",
    "the disk rapidly becomes gravitationally unstable , and fragmentation occurs before the development of sufficient non - axisymmetric perturbation , which can redistribute the angular momentum in the disk and suppress fragmentation . as a result , many clumps appear in the collapsing primordial cloud .",
    "although some clumps fall onto the primary star , many of them survive .",
    "thus , it is thought that a multiple stellar system , or stellar cluster , appears in unmagnetized primordial clouds .",
    "in addition , some of the clumps are ejected from the centre of the cloud with masses ranging from @xmath249 to @xmath250 .",
    "these clumps are expected to become metal - free low mass stars as already shown in previous studies @xcite . + * * effects of magnetic field * + when the primordial cloud is magnetized , no fragmentation occurs and a single massive star forms .",
    "the magnetic field is amplified in proportion to @xmath251 in a spherically collapsing cloud .",
    "the density contrast between the first collapsed object or the initial cloud ( @xmath252 ) and the protostar ( @xmath253 ) is about @xmath254 orders of magnitude .",
    "thus , the magnetic field around the protostar at its formation is about @xmath255 times stronger than that of the first collapsed object .",
    "in addition , after protostar formation , the magnetic field can be amplified by both mri and shearing motion between the protostar and infalling gas . moreover , the magnetic field in primordial clouds does not dissipate significantly because of the high gas temperature and absence of dust grains . therefore , the circumstellar gas near the protostar has a non - negligible magnetic field strength even when the magnetic field is quite weak in a prestellar cloud . around the protostar ,",
    "the magnetic field can effectively transfer angular momentum by both magnetic braking and protostellar jets .",
    "thus , gas can fall directly onto the protostar without forming a rotation - supported disk . as a result",
    ", only a single massive star appears in a magnetized primordial cloud .",
    "+ * * single star or stellar cluster * + although the magnetic field suppresses disk formation and subsequent fragmentation , an extremely weak field can not affect the dynamical evolution of a primordial cloud .",
    "to quantitatively estimate the effects of a magnetic field , we calculated the evolution of primordial clouds with different parameters of the initial magnetic field .",
    "our calculation showed that the magnetic field can affect the formation and evolution of population iii stars when the plasma @xmath80 around the protostar is @xmath256 , which is realized when the initial cloud , which has a number density of @xmath166 , has a magnetic field strength of @xmath257 g .",
    "we can also estimate the magnetic field strength of the ambient medium using the relation @xmath251 ( table  [ table:1 ] ) . assuming a hydrogen number density of @xmath258 , the population iii star formation in magnetized clouds can be classified as @xmath259 thus",
    ", the effect of the magnetic field can be ignored when the magnetic field in the ambient medium is weaker than 0.1pg , @xmath260 g. note that this condition may differ somewhat if the initial cloud has a larger initial rotational energy . + * * mass accretion rate onto primary star * + in previous studies with one - zone or one - dimensional calculations , the mass accretion rate onto the population iii star was estimated as @xmath261yr@xmath73 . in our calculation , all the models have almost the same mass accretion rate of @xmath248yr@xmath73 .",
    "thus , the mass accretion rate derived in our three - dimensional calculation is comparable to that in spherically symmetric calculations .",
    "in addition , the mass accretion rate depends little on the magnetic field strength . when the primordial cloud has a relatively strong magnetic field , no disk forms , and gas falls directly onto the protostar .",
    "thus , it is natural that the mass accretion rate in the magnetized cloud corresponds well to that derived in spherically symmetric calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas accretion process is complicated in clouds without a magnetic field ( or with an extremely weak field ) .",
    "in such a cloud , gas first falls onto the region near the protostar and tries to form a circumstellar disk .",
    "however , fragmentation occurs just after the disk - like structure appears .",
    "after disk fragmentation and clump formation , clumps disturb the circumstellar region . the angular momentum around the primary star",
    "is effectively transferred by the gravitational torque caused by orbital motion of the clumps , and gas accretion onto the primary star is promoted .",
    "although clump merger and mass exchange between the primary star and clumps contribute to the mass growth of the primary star , the primary star effectively acquires most of its mass from the circumstellar region or the infalling envelope . +",
