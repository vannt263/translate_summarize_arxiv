    "0.25 in in this paper we study an eigenvalue problem for a neumann sturm - liouville operator defined on a metric tree ( a connected graph with no cycles ) @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the set of all vertices and @xmath2 is the set of all edges with lengths @xmath3 .",
    "we let @xmath4 be the set of all pendant ( boundary ) vertices .",
    "any edge connected to a pendant vertex is called a boundary edge . for any internal vertex @xmath5 ,",
    "we let @xmath6 be the set of all indices @xmath7 such that the edge @xmath8 is connected to @xmath5 .",
    "the degree of @xmath5 is defined as @xmath9 .",
    "we also choose an arbitrary internal vertex @xmath10 to be the root .",
    "then we assign local coordinates to the edges such that for any edge @xmath11 , the endpoint of @xmath8 further from the root has local coordinates @xmath12 , while the endpoint closer to the root has local coordinate @xmath13 .",
    "thus all pendant vertices have local coordinate @xmath12 , while the root @xmath10 has local coordinate @xmath13 corresponding to the edge @xmath8 connected to it .",
    "thus the neumann sturm - liouville problem can be expressed as functions @xmath14 s defined on the edges @xmath8 s satisfying @xmath15 where each @xmath16 is the potential function defined on @xmath8 ( @xmath17 ) , and ,    1 .",
    "@xmath18 whenever @xmath8 is a boundary edge .",
    "0.25 in also continuity and kirchhoff conditions are imposed at each internal vertex . at any internal vertex @xmath5 other than the root",
    ", there are some incoming edges @xmath8 s and one outgoing edge @xmath19 .",
    "the local coordinates of @xmath5 is @xmath12 with respect to @xmath19 but @xmath13 with respect to the other @xmath8 s .    1 .",
    "the continuity and kirchhoff conditions at @xmath5 are defined as @xmath20 wherever @xmath7 is such that @xmath21 but @xmath22 .    at the root @xmath10",
    ", all the connecting edges are incoming . hence    1 .",
    "the continuity and kirchhoff conditions are defined as : for any @xmath23 , @xmath24    the above formulation of the sturm - liouville problem on @xmath25 is essentially the same as in @xcite .",
    "note that the neumann boundary conditions ( a1 ) can be viewed as a special case of ( a2 ) , for the degree of a pendant vertex is @xmath26 , hence continuity condition is empty and right hand side of the kirchhoff condition vanishes .",
    "it is well - known that the above problem has a discrete spectrum .",
    "a real number @xmath27 is an eigenvalue of the above problem if it has a nontrivial solution @xmath28 , i.e. , at least one of @xmath14 s is nontrivial .",
    "we write @xmath29 , and let @xmath30 be the set of eigenvalues for the vector potential function @xmath31 . in particular , @xmath32 denotes the set of eigenvalues for @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 for all @xmath17 .    in the simplest case @xmath35 , the above problem is reduced to a usual sturm - liouville problem on a finite interval @xmath36 with the neumann boundary condition . in this case , in 1929 , ambarzumyan @xcite showed that @xmath37 implies @xmath38 almost everywhere .",
    "this seems to be the first example of an inverse problem where the potential function can be determined uniquely by the spectrum , without any additional data .",
    "later , chern and shen @xcite extended the result to vectorial sturm - liouville systems . in the case of the dirichlet boundary condition ,",
    "it was shown by chern et al .",
    "@xcite that the potential function must be identically equal to 0 if an additional condition @xmath39 is imposed .",
    "recently , the ambarzumyan problem for periodic boundary conditions was studied by yang et al .",
    "they showed that for a vectorial sturm - liouville system of dimension @xmath40 with the periodic boundary condition , if the eigenvalues are @xmath41 with multiplicities @xmath42 , then the vector potential must be @xmath12 .",
    "thus the ambarzumyan theorem , originally specified for the neumann boundary condition , can be generalized to several ambarzumyan problems with different boundary conditions .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the ambarzumyan problem for the neumann sturm - liouville problems defined on trees . in this direction",
    ", pivovarchik @xcite showed that when @xmath25 consists of three edges with equal length and one triple junction , an analogue of ambarzumyan theorem is valid for the problem ( [ eq : main ] ) with ( a1)@xmath43(a3 ) .",
    "later , carlson and pivovarchik  @xcite extended the result to any trees such that @xmath44 are all rational numbers , where @xmath45 is the total length of @xmath25 given by @xmath46 in this case , we can find infinitely many eigenvalues explicitly given by @xmath47 for some integer @xmath48 , which makes the analysis much easier than a more general case .",
    "as for the dirichlet problem on a star - shaped graph , we refer to a recent paper by hung et al @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related results on the sturm - liouville problems on graphs .",
    "in this paper we consider the sturm - liouville problem on trees such that @xmath49 are not necessarily rational .",
    "the following theorem is a main result of this paper , which gives a solution to the ambarzumyan problem on general trees .",
    "[ th : ambar ] for the neumann sturm - liouville operator defined on @xmath25 , @xmath50 implies @xmath33 almost everywhere",
    ".    when we deal with general trees , we encounter two kinds of difficulty .",
    "the first one is that we must handle trees with arbitrary number of edges .",
    "moreover , even if the number of edges is given , there are various trees with different topology . in order to handle all trees",
    ", we shall derive a recursive formula for characteristic functions whose zeros are the square roots of eigenvalues .",
    "the second one is that we may not have explicit eigenvalues as ( [ explicit ] ) . to overcome the difficulty , we approximate @xmath44 precisely by rational numbers at the same time by applying a ( generalized ) pigeon hole argument .    in section  2",
    ", we shall study direct problems and derive recursive formulas for characteristic functions . in section  3 ,",
    "we compute the expansion of characteristic functions . in section  4",
    ", we present a key lemma for the approximation of eigenvalues .",
    "finally section  5 is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ th : ambar ] .    hereafter in this paper , we shall let @xmath51 be a pendant vertex which is an endpoint of the edge @xmath52 , while @xmath53 is another vertex at the other end . and without loss of generality",
    ", we assume that @xmath54 is connected to @xmath53 , and is closer to @xmath10 than @xmath52 .",
    "let @xmath55 , and let @xmath56 and @xmath57 be ( linearly independent ) solutions of @xmath58 with the initial conditions @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "we sometimes write @xmath61 as @xmath62 and @xmath63 as @xmath64 just for simplicity . for each edge @xmath65 , we write @xmath14 as @xmath66 then from ( a1)@xmath43(a3 ) , we have a system of linear equations for the unknowns @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "thus we may express the coefficient matrix of the system of linear equations as @xmath69 where the first row corresponds to the neumann boundary condition at @xmath70 , and the second and third rows correspond to the continuity condition and the kirchhoff condition at @xmath53 .",
    "note that in the first row , we include the term @xmath71 although the corresponding coefficient @xmath72 .",
    "we do this in order to have a systematic form of @xmath73 during reductions , as we shall see later .",
    "we define a characteristic function by @xmath74 so that @xmath75 if and only if @xmath76 .",
    "we note that the characteristic function depends on the orientation of edges and how to express the coefficient matrix , but the set of zeros of @xmath77 does not depend on them .",
    "next we introduce another eigenvalue problem by replacing ( a1 ) with the following condition :    if @xmath51 is an endpoint of any boundary edge @xmath8 , the solution of ( [ eq : main ] ) satisfies the zero dirichlet boundary condition @xmath78 at other boundary vertices , the solution satisfies the homogeneous neumann boundary condition as in ( a1 ) .",
    "hereafter , we call ( [ eq : main ] ) with ( a2)@xmath43(a4 ) the dirichlet - neumann problem . if we impose the zero dirichlet condition at @xmath79 , then @xmath80 .",
    "thus we may express the corresponding coefficient matrix by @xmath81 then we define a characteristic function for the dirichlet - neumann problem by @xmath82 again , the set of zeros of @xmath83 does not depend on the orientation of edges and how to express the coefficient matrix .",
    "our interest will be only in zeros of the characteristic functions , and hence the non - uniqueness of characteristic functions will not affect the following argument .    for a general tree ,",
    "it is not easy to express explicitly the characteristic functions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "instead , we may compute these functions recursively as follows .",
    "let @xmath86 be a subtree of @xmath25 obtained by removing @xmath87 .",
    "we denote by @xmath88 the corresponding characteristic function of the problem with neumann condition at @xmath53 in case @xmath89 .",
    "however if the degree of @xmath53 is greater than @xmath90 , then we take the continuity and kirchhoff conditions at @xmath53 instead .",
    "thus we say @xmath88 the characteristic function for a problem on @xmath86 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "1 )        if we remove @xmath87 and replace the matching conditions ( a2 ) and ( a3 ) by @xmath91 at the vertex @xmath53 for any @xmath92 , we have subtrees of @xmath25 on which the dirichlet - neumann problems are defined .",
    "for each subtree , a characteristic function of the dirichlet - neumann problem is defined as above .",
    "we denote by @xmath93 the product of these characteristic functions .    for trees with two or more edges , we have the following recursive formulas .",
    "[ le : recur ] assume that @xmath94 .",
    "then the characteristic functions have the following properties :    @xmath95 .",
    "@xmath96 .    since @xmath97 and @xmath98 , by expansions with respect to the first row and the first column",
    ", we have @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath102 matrices given by @xmath103 and @xmath104 respectively . noting that @xmath100 describes conditions on the neumann / kirchhoff problem for @xmath25 with @xmath87 removed , we have @xmath105 similarly , since @xmath101 describes conditions on the dirichlet - neumann problems for subtrees of @xmath25 obtained by removing @xmath87 , we have @xmath106 thus the proof of ( a ) is completed .    next ,",
    "let us consider the dirichlet - neumann problem . in this case",
    ", we have the expansion , since @xmath107 and @xmath108 , @xmath109 this proves ( b ) .",
    "more general recursive formulas were obtained in a recent paper by law and pivovarchik @xcite .",
    "interested readers might like to read a spectral determinant approach to the same formulas @xcite .",
    "now we compute the characteristic function of a general tree as follows . given a tree with two or more edges , we remove one of the edges of @xmath25 and use the recursive formulas .",
    "repeating this procedure , we will reach to problems on single edges . for a single edge @xmath65",
    ", we may define its characteristic functions by @xmath110 thus we can express @xmath77 and @xmath111 as polynomials of @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "next , we consider the zero potential @xmath33 , and denote by @xmath114 and @xmath115 the corresponding characteristic functions of the neumann / kirchhoff problem and the dirichlet - neumann problem , respectively .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath116 and @xmath117 be characteristic functions for the neumann and dirichlet - neumann problems for @xmath25 with @xmath87 removed . for a tree with a single edge @xmath65 , to be consistent with ( [ eq : iniphi ] ) , we define its characteristic functions by @xmath118 for trees with two or more edges , the characteristic functions can be computed by using the following recursive formulas repeatedly and ( [ eq : inipsi ] ) .",
    "[ le : recur2 ] assume @xmath119 .",

    "the solutions of ( [ eq : second ] ) are given by @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "then the above recursive formulas can be obtained in the same way as lemma  [ le : recur ] .",
