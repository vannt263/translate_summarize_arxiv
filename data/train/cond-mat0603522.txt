    "granular conductors form a new class of artificial materials with tunable electronic properties controlled at the nanoscale and composed of close - packed granules varying in size from a few to hundred nanometers ( often referred to as",
    "_ nanocrystals _ ) .",
    "the granules are large enough to possess a distinct electronic structure , but sufficiently small to be mesoscopic in nature and exhibit effects of quantized electronic levels of confined electrons .",
    "granular conductors combine the unique properties of individual- and the collective properties of coupled nanocrystals opening a new route for potential novel electronic , optical , and optoelectronic applications .",
    "applications range from light emitting devices to photovoltaic cells and bio - sensors .",
    "the intense interest is motivated not only by the important technological promise but by the appeal of dealing with the experimentally accessible model system that is governed by tunable cooperative effects of disorder , electron correlations , and quantum phenomena  @xcite .    among traditional methods of preparation of such materials ,",
    "the most common are the thermal evaporation and sputtering techniques . during those processes metallic and insulating components",
    "are simultaneously evaporated or sputtered onto a substrate .",
    "diffusion of metallic component leads to the formation of small metallic grains , usually 3 - 50 , see fig .",
    "variations of grain sizes within a sample produced by these methods can be achieved to as low as about @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "depending on the materials used for the preparation , one can obtain magnetic systems , superconductors , insulators , etc .",
    "recent years have seen a remarkable progress achieved in the design of granular conductors with the controllable structure parameters .",
    "granules can be capped with organic ( ligands ) or inorganic molecules which connect and regulate the coupling between them . altering the size and shape of granules one can regulate quantum confinement effects . in particular , tuning microscopic parameters one can vary the granular materials from being relatively good metals to pronounced insulators as a function of the strength of electron tunnelling couplings between conducting grains .",
    "this makes granular conductors a perfect exemplary system for studing metal - insulator transition and related phenomena .",
    "one emerging technique to create granular systems is through self - assembling colloidal nanocrystals  @xcite .",
    "for instance  @xcite describe almost perfectly periodic two - dimensional arrays of monodisperse ( with grain size variations within @xmath1 ) gold nanoparticles covered by ligand molecules that play a role of an insulating layer .",

    ".    it has been realized for quite some time that granularity can bring new physics extending already wealthy list of remarkable effects exhibited by disordered systems even further .",
    "one of the early observation was the stretched exponential temperature behavior of the conductivity in the strongly disordered films and arrays of metallic granules in the insulating regime ( see  @xcite for a review ) : @xmath6 with @xmath7 being a material dependent constant .",
    "this behavior resembled the mott - efros - shklovskii variable range hopping conductivity in semiconductors  @xcite and appeared to be generic for granular arrays both metallic and semiconducting  either irregular  @xcite and strictly periodic  @xcite .",
    "several explanations have been advanced for this striking behavior , but real understanding was achieved only recently  @xcite .",
    "a most recent incitement to intense and deep study of physics of granular materials was given by the influential works  @xcite where a logarithmic dependence of the conductivity @xmath8 @xmath9 with @xmath10 and @xmath11 being material dependent constants , was observed in the metallic conductivity domain .",
    "this logarithmic behavior , has been observed in both two and three dimensional samples thus ruling out the tempting explanation in terms of the weak localization  @xcite or interaction corrections  @xcite which result in logarithmic behavior in two dimensions only .",
    "the call for understanding these results brought to life new models  @xcite which evolved into a new direction of research that will be one of the major topics of our review .",
    "the feature that plays a fundamental role , especially at low temperatures , is the pronounced discreteness of the electronic levels due to electron confinement within a single grain .",
    "the mesoscopic scale of the grains brings about the levels statistics and all the wealth of the related effects  @xcite .",
    "the mean level spacing @xmath12 in a single grain is inversely proportional to the volume of the grain , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the volume of the grain and @xmath15 is the density of states at the fermi energy . for metal particles of size of several nanometers ,",
    "the parameter @xmath12 is typically of order of several kelvin .",
    "for example , for an aluminum particle with radius @xmath16 one has @xmath17 .",

    "superconductivity brings yet another aspect to diversity of the interesting effects in granular materials  @xcite .",
    "one of them is a counterintuitive suppression of the conductivity due to superconducting fluctuations .    in this review",
    "we summarize the recent theoretical progress in understanding of the phenomena observed in granular metals and superconductors .",
    "these are effects that do not demand ultra low temperatures ( and thus very sophisticated experimental setups ) and are thus promising from the standpoint of possible applications",
    ". physics of these phenomena is not particularly material specific and our consideration will be based on the correspondingly general models of the granular systems .",
    "this review deals with the systems which we call a granular metals and which are well modelled by an array of the identical in size and shape but mesoscopically different metallic particles , the intergranular electron coupling being described via the tunnelling matrix .",
    "the grain arrangements may be either periodic or irregular .",
    "the effect of irregularities in the grain positions and in the strengths of the tunneling coupling on the physical properties of granular systems is different for metallic and insulating samples .",
    "if the coupling between the grains is sufficiently strong and the system is well conducting , the irregularities are not very important . on the contrary , irregularities become crucial in the limit of low coupling where the system is an insulator . as a matter of practice , recent advances in fabrication techniques now permit very regular arrays with the fluctuations in the granule size within the @xmath20 precision  @xcite . as regular arrays",
    "promise many technological applications the further progress in making perfect systems is expected .    at the same time ,",
    "disorder related to either internal defects inside and/or on the surface of the individual granules and to the charged impurities in the insulating substrate / matrix is unavoidable . even in metallic grains with the mean free part exceeding their size , the electrons that move ballistically within the granules yet scatter at the grain boundaries irregularities ;",
    "the eletfron motion becomes chaotic with the resulting effect equivalent to the action of the intragranular disorder ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this surface chaotization would have been absent in the atomically perfect spherical ( or , say , cubical ) granules . in such ideal granules the additional degeneracies of the energy levels",
    "would have led to singularities in physical quantities .",
    "however , the slightest deviations ( even of the order of @xmath21 or of the order of the electron wavelength ) of the shape of the grains from the ideal spheres or cubes would have lifted the accidental degeneracy of the levels ( this would be equivalent to adding an internal disorder ) .",
    "thus one can justly assume that the grains are always microscopically irregular .",
    "moreover , the coupling between the grains is the source of the additional irregularities .",
    "we thus can adopt the model with the diffusive electron motion within the each grain without any loss of generality . in this model the use of expression of eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) for the mean level spacing @xmath12 is fully justified .",
    "the key parameter that determines most of the physical properties of the granular array is the average tunnelling conductance @xmath22 between the neighboring grains .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless conductance @xmath23 ( corresponding to one spin component ) measured in the units of the quantum conductance @xmath24 : @xmath25 . as we will see below , the samples with @xmath26 exhibit metallic transport properties , while those with @xmath27 show an insulating behavior .",
    "one of the most important energy parameters of the granular system is the single grain coulomb charging energy @xmath28 .",
    "this energy is equal to the change in the energy of the grain when adding or removing one electron , and it plays a crucial role in the transport properties in the insulating regime when electrons are localized in the grains , such that the charge of each grain is quantized .",
    "the physics of the insulating state is closely related to the well known phenomenon of the coulomb blockade of a single grain connected to a metallic reservoir .",
    "the behavior of a single grain in a contact with a reservoir has been discussed in many articles and reviews ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the main features of the coulomb blockade can be summarized as follows : ( i ) if the grain is weakly coupled to the metallic contact , @xmath29 , the charge on the grain is almost quantized ; this is the regime of the so - called coulomb blockade .",
    "( ii ) in the opposite limit , @xmath30 , the effects of the charge quantization are negligible and the electrons freely exchange between the granule and reservoir .",
    "although the systems we consider are arrays of interconnected granules rather than a single grain coupled to a bulk metal , a somewhat similar behavior is expected : in the regime of the strong coupling between the grains , @xmath30 , electrons propagate easily through the granular sample and the coulomb interaction is screened . in the opposite limit of the low coupling , @xmath29 , the charge on each grain",
    "gets quantized as in the standard coulomb blockade behavior . in this case",
    "an electron has to overcome electrostatic barrier of the order @xmath31 in order to hop onto the neighboring granule .",
    "this impedes the transport at temperatures @xmath32 lower than @xmath28 .    throughout this review",
    "we will be always assuming that the mean level spacing @xmath12 from eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) is the smallest energy scale . in particular ,",
    "in all cases we take the condition @xmath33 be satisfied .",
    "this is the most realistic condition when dealing with the metallic particles of a nanometer - size scale , given that the charging energy @xmath28 is inversely proportional to the radius @xmath10 of the grains , whereas the mean level spacing @xmath12 is inversely proportional to the volume @xmath14 and also taking into account the high density of energy states in metals .",
    "note that this may not be the case in arrays of semiconductor dots , where @xmath31 and @xmath34 may appear of the same order , but this goes beyond the scope of our review .",
    "another important thing to remember is that the intergranular ( tunneling ) conductance @xmath23 is much smaller than the intragrain conductance @xmath35 by the very meaning of the notion of  granular system \" : @xmath36 the intra - grain conductance @xmath35 is brought by scattering on impurities or on the boundaries of the grains and the inequality  ( [ granularity ] ) means that the grains are not very dirty .",
    "the case @xmath37 can be viewed as a homogeneously disordered system and we do dwell on this limit here .",
    "the single grain conductance @xmath35 can be most easily defined as the physical conductance of a granule of a cubic geometry measured in the units of the quantum conductance @xmath38 . in mesoscopic",
    "physics it is customary , however , to relate the single grain conductance @xmath35 to the single grain thouless energy @xmath39 as @xmath40 , where the energy @xmath39 is defined as @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the classical diffusion coefficient .",
    "other parameters are @xmath43 , the fermi velocity , @xmath44 , the elastic scattering time within the grains , and @xmath45 , the dimensionality of the grain .",
    "the length @xmath10 in eq .",
    "( [ thouless ] ) is the linear size ( radius ) of the grain .",
    "if the grains are not very dirty , such that the electrons move inside the grains ballistically , the mean free path @xmath46 should be replaced by the size of the grains @xmath47 .",
    "the thouless energy @xmath39 , eq .  ( [ thouless ] ) , is proportional to the inverse time that it takes for an electron to traverse the grain .",
    "the energy @xmath39 , eq .",
    "( [ thouless ] ) , exceeds the mean level spacing @xmath12 , eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , and therefore the intragrain conductance @xmath35 is always large , @xmath48 , whereas the inter - granular conductance @xmath23 can be either larger or smaller than unity .",
    "the above parameters make a full set of variables describing properties of the normal granular metals .",
    "if the constituent particles are made out of the superconductor material , a wealth of new interesting phenomena arises .",
    "the behavior of such a system can be quantified by adding one more energy parameter , the superconducting gap @xmath49 of the material of a single granule .",
    "now , if the inter - grain coupling is sufficiently strong , the system can turn a superconductor at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "properties of such a superconductor are not very different from those of bulk superconductors",
    ".    on the contrary , in the opposite limit of weak coupling between the granules , an array of superconducting grains can transform into an insulator at @xmath50 . in this regime the cooper pairs are locally formed in each grain but remain localized inside the grains due to the strong on - site coulomb repulsion leading to the coulomb blockade . because of localization , the number of the cooper pairs in each grain is fixed and , according to the uncertainty principle , this leads to strong phase fluctuations . thus the system does not develop the global coherence , and the global macroscopic superconductivity is suppressed . one can describe this effect using the model of superconductor grains coupled via the josephson junctions .",
    "such a system is characterized by three energy parameters : the superconductor gap , @xmath51 , characterizing a single grain , the josephson coupling @xmath52 , and the grain charging coulomb energy @xmath28 .",
    "strong josephson coupling , @xmath53 , suppresses the phase fluctuations leading to the globally coherent superconducting state at sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "if @xmath54 , the coulomb blockade prevails , the cooper pairs get localized at @xmath55 , and the system falls into an insulating state .    note that even in the insulator state the superconducting gap @xmath51 still exists in each grain and its value is close to the gap magnitude in the bulk provided @xmath56 . if the latter inequality is not fulfilled the superconducting gap in the grains is suppressed or can even be fully destroyed  @xcite .",
    "there are interesting effects in this regime but we do not consider them here because the relevant region of the parameters corresponds to either too small grains or too weak superconductors .    at low temperatures ,",
    "the josephson coupling @xmath52 is expressed via the tunnelling conductance @xmath23 as @xmath57 @xcite and , at first glance , one could have concluded that the transition between the insulating and superconducting states should have happened at @xmath58 .",
    "however , this simple estimate holds only in the weak coupling regime , @xmath59 that assumes @xmath60 . at stronger coupling ,",
    "the coulomb energy @xmath28 is renormalized down to the value @xmath61 ,  @xcite due to electron tunnelling between the neighboring grains . therefore ,",
    "in the limit of the strong coupling , @xmath62 , the effective coulomb energy @xmath63 is always smaller than the josephson coupling , @xmath64 , implying the superconducting ground state . shown in fig .",
    "[ is phase ] is the schematic phase diagram summarizing the above consideration  @xcite .    for many superconducting granular samples available",
    "experimentally the ratio @xmath65 is large . in this case , as one can see from phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ is phase ] , the transition between the superconducting and insulating at @xmath66 occurs at @xmath67 @xcite .    to conclude our brief introduction to granular superconductors we note that for the most of experimentally available samples , the grains are much smaller than the bulk superconducting coherence length of the granule material @xmath68 this allows one to neglect variations of the superconducting order parameter @xmath51 inside the grains and treat a single grain as a zero dimensional object . as the condition  ( [ k2 ] ) is at this point the most common experimental situation , we will further concentrate mainly on this regime .    as we now see ,",
    "depending on the parameters of the system , many different physical situations appear and the phase diagram of a granular material is quite reach . in the next two sections , sec .  [",
    "normal ] and sec .",
    "[ superconducting ] , we will focus on the systems consisting of the normal and superconducting grains respectively .",
    "we start the discussion of the properties of the granular systems consisting of the normal grains by presenting the main results and their qualitative explanations . this may help the reader to understand the basic physics of the system and to learn important formulae suitable for a direct comparison with experiments without going into the technical detail of theoretical models , which will be presented at the subsequent parts of each section .      the key parameter that determines the transport properties of the granular materials is the tunneling conductance @xmath23 . in the strong coupling regime , @xmath30 ,",
    "a granular array has metallic properties , while in the opposite case , @xmath29 , the array is an insulator .",
    "the insulating state appears as a result of the strong coulomb correlations that block electron transport at low temperatures . generally speaking , apart from the coulomb interaction effects one has also to consider the effects of quantum interference that may play an important role in the low conducting samples . in homogenously disordered systems",
    "the interference effects play an important role leading to the localization of electron states in the absence of interaction  @xcite .    in the metallic regime and at high enough temperatures both coulomb correlation and interference effects are weak . in this case",
    "the global sample conductivity @xmath69 is given by the classical drude formula , in particular , for a periodic cubic granular array @xmath70 where @xmath10 is the size of the grains and @xmath45 is the dimensionality of the sample .",
    "formula  ( [ conductivity0 ] ) has a straightforward meaning : in order to obtain the physical conductance of the contact , one should multiply its dimensionless conductance , @xmath23 , by @xmath71 ( the factor @xmath72 is due to spin and @xmath73 ) and , then , multiplying the result by @xmath74 one arrives at the conductivity per unit volume .",
    "although eq .",
    "( [ conductivity0 ] ) is written for the periodic array , the electron system is not translationally invariant , otherwise the sample conductivity would be infinite .",
    "equation  ( [ conductivity0 ] ) is valid for grains with an internal disorder , such that the electron motion inside the grains is chaotic .",
    "when hopping from grain to grain , the electron momentum is not conserved and this leads to the finite conductivity @xmath75 , eq .",
    "( [ conductivity0 ] ) .",
    "the conductance of the contact @xmath23 depends on the microscopic properties of the contact , and we will consider it in most cases as a phenomenological dimensionless parameter controlling behavior of the system . note that the model of a periodic array assumes no variation in tunneling conductances .    upon decreasing temperature",
    "the coulomb interactions become relevant and formula eq .",
    "( [ conductivity0 ] ) does not hold any more .",
    "below we will discuss coulomb effects in more detail and find that their manifestation in granular systems may differ noticeably from that in homogeneously disordered  metals .      in the metallic regime electrons tunnel",
    "easily from granule to granule .",
    "the time @xmath76 that the electron spends inside a grain plays an important role in the metallic regime : the corresponding characteristic energy @xmath77 is related to the tunneling conductance and the mean energy level spacing as @xmath78the energy @xmath79 can also be interpreted as the width of the smearing of the energy levels in the grains . in the limit of large conductances , @xmath30 ,",
    "this width exceeds the energy spacing @xmath12 and the discreteness of the levels within a single grain ceases to be relevant",
    ".    since the electron motion on the scales well exceeding the granule size is always diffusive ( even in the case of the ballistic electron motion inside each grain ) , the electron motion on the time scales larger than @xmath80 can be described by the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath81 related to @xmath79 as @xmath82 then the einstein relation gives the conductivity of the granular sample as @xmath83 for periodic arrays eq .",

    "at the same time eq .",
    "( [ e10 ] ) is more general than eq .",
    "( [ conductivity0 ] ) since with the properly defined diffusion constant @xmath81 it applies to arrays with the arbitrary grain arrangement as well .",
    "the energy scale @xmath79 plays a very important role ; many physical quantities have qualitatively different behavior depending on whether they are dominated by the energies higher or lower than @xmath79 .    from the experience with the homogeneously disordered metals one",

    "( [ conductivity0 ] ) : ( i ) electron - electron interactions  @xcite and ( ii ) quantum interference effects  @xcite . accordingly , constructing the theory of granular conductors with the reference of highly advanced theory of disordered metals , one can expect two corresponding distinct corrections to @xmath85 .",
    "since in the metallic domain electrons effectively screen out the on - site coulomb interactions the bare magnitudes of which are high because of small sizes of the grains , the notion of the interaction corrections to conductivity is well justified .    to gain the qualitative understanding of the interaction effects , we introduce the characteristic interaction temporal- and the corresponding spatial scales @xmath86 and @xmath87 associated with this time .",

    "for this reason , in the absence of the superconductivity , the most interesting and noticeable effects come from the coulomb correlations .",
    "the above considerations of the interactions in a single grain can be easily generalized to the case of a granular array .",
    "it is clear that the bare interactions in the spin and cooper pair channels are short - range and thus they have to be diagonal in the granular indices . at the same time the coulomb interaction is long - range and",

    "a quantitative analysis of these effects will be given in the subsequent subsections .",
    "a granular superconductor , similarly to a granular metal , can be viewed as an array of superconducting granules coupled via electron tunneling .",
    "superconducting properties of an array in many ways are determined by the properties of granules which it is formed of .",
    "for this reason we begin our discussion with reviewing properties of superconductivity in a single small isolated grain .",
    "this question was first addressed by anderson  @xcite who realized that the s - wave superconductivity is almost insensitive to disorder of general kind as long as it does not break the time reversal invariance .",
    "this includes , in particular , the diffusive scattering by the grain boundaries that is in many ways similar to the scattering by potential impurities in the bulk .",

    "as soon as the mean level spacing @xmath12 exceeds @xmath619 ( or @xmath620 for the bulk superconductors ) , the superconducting gap @xmath618 vanishes . to be more precise , it remains finite due to fluctuations but its value is sufficiently reduced and in this regime the grain can not be considered as a `` true '' superconductor .",
    "nevertheless , the superconducting pairing is still present manifesting , for example , in the parity effect ,  @xcite",
    ".    the anderson theory agrees well with experiments .",
    "in particular , electron spectrum of ultrasmall superconducting @xmath621 grains was studied by  @xcite where a well defined superconducting gap was shown to survive down to grain sizes @xmath622 , while smaller grains @xmath623 did not show any superconducting features in their electron spectrum .",
    "it is worth noting that , while in the diffusive / chaotic grains the density of states in the vicinity of the chemical potential indeed well agrees with the corresponding bulk values , this is not necessarily the case for the ballistic grains possessing certain geometric symmetries .",
    "for example , in a spherical grain one naturally expects that the energy levels are strongly degenerate .",
    "this may change the density of states on the fermi level significantly resulting in a considerable change of the transition temperature .",
    "the possibility to utilize the enhanced density of states that may appear from the orbital degeneracy in order to increase the single grain critical temperature was recently suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "although all these effects are very interesting , in this review we follow our line of studying models with parameters that can easily be achieved in existing granular materials .",
    "so , we assume everywhere that granules are sufficiently large to maintain the local superconductivity within each grain , i.e. that the anderson criterion is satisfied @xmath624 we assume also that the grains are diffusive or do not have an ideal shape like spheres or cubes , which excludes the possibility of an accidental degeneracy of the electron spectrum .    as a final remark in our discussion of superconductivity in a single grain",

    "it is clear that an array with sufficiently strongly coupled grains should be able to maintain the superconducting coherence in a whole sample because the coupling reduces the phase fluctuations . on the contrary , in the opposite limit of a weak coupling , one expects that the strong coulomb interaction should lead to the coulomb blockade of the cooper pairs in analogy with the coulomb blockade of electrons in granular metals in the low coupling regime .    in order to quantify this intuitive statement abeles  @xcite , following the earlier idea of anderson  @xcite ,",
    "suggested to compare the energy of the josephson coupling of the neighboring grains with the coulomb energy .",

    "however , the anderson - abeles criterion was found later to be in conflict with many other experiments .",
    "after the pioneering works  @xcite it became clear that the boundary between the superconducting and insulating states at @xmath50 is determined by the normal state conductance of the film rather then by the ratio of the josephson and coulomb energies .    this fact is illustrated by the experimental resistivity temperature dependencies of samples with different thicknesses shown in fig .
