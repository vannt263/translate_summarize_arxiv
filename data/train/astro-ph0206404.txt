    "we are entering an era in which numerous experiments will search for astrophysical gravitational radiation .",
    "ground - based detectors such as ligo ( barish 2000 ) , virgo ( fidecaro et al . 1997 ) , geo600 ( schilling 1998 ) , tama ( ando et al .",
    "2002 ) , and others focus on relatively high frequencies @xmath1  hz . these frequencies are appropriate for the final inspiral and merger of binaries with total masses @xmath2 .",
    "space - based missions such as the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ; see , e.g. , danzmann 2000 ) will complement this frequency range by focusing on comparatively low frequencies , @xmath3  hz . in this range",
    "there are a number of  guaranteed \" sources in the form of main sequence and white dwarf binaries , but there is much more uncertainty about the prevalence and properties of double compact binaries containing neutron stars and black holes .",
    "such binaries are of great interest for many reasons , such as their use as probes of strong gravity and their potential to illuminate other aspects of astronomy , including the evolution of galaxies .    the existence of a new class of double compact binaries is suggested by two recent lines of evidence .",
    "first , observations of the kinematics of the central regions of some globular clusters suggests that black holes with @xmath4 may exist in their cores ( e.g. , gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; damico et al .",
    "second , x - ray observations have revealed variable , unusually high flux point sources in a number of galaxies ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 ; fabbiano , schweizer , & mackie 1997 ; colbert & mushotzky 1999 ; zezas , georgantopoulos , & ward 1999 ; kaaret et al . 2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2001 ; fabbiano , zezas , & murray 2001 ; see colbert & ptak 2002 for a catalog of objects ) .",
    "the rapid and strong variability of these sources indicates that they are black holes .",
    "if their flux is not strongly beamed , then for their luminosities to be below the eddington luminosity @xmath5  erg  s@xmath6 , at which radiation forces balance gravity , the masses of the brightest sources must be at least @xmath7 ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",
    "in addition , their off - center positions in their host galaxies indicate that in many cases the masses can not be substantially greater than @xmath8 , otherwise dynamical friction would cause the black holes to sink rapidly to the dynamical center ( kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; tremaine , ostriker , & spitzer 1975 ) .",
    "recent optical observations suggest that for at least some of the sources , the x - rays may not be beamed strongly , based on recombination emission from surrounding nebulae ( pakull & merioni 2002 ) .",
    "this implies that the total luminosity is indeed high , so that if the sources are sub - eddington ( but see begelman 2002 ) there may therefore be a significant number of @xmath9 black holes in the universe .",
    "currently , these sources are preferentially in star forming regions or in starburst galaxies ( matsumoto et al .",
    "2001 ; liu & bregman 2001 ) .",
    "a number of these objects are associated with dense young stellar clusters ( e.g. , matsumoto et al .",
    "combined with the kinematic evidence in globular clusters , this implies that black holes of this sort undergo frequent dynamical encounters .",
    "it has been suggested that the ultraluminous x - ray sources originated due to dynamical encounters in globular clusters , then merged with their host galaxies ( miller & hamilton 2002a , b ) .",
    "other proposals , if these objects are @xmath10 black holes instead of being strongly beamed ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; king 2002 ; krding , falcke , & markoff 2002 ) or super - eddington by a large factor ( begelman 2002 ) , are that they form as a result of a core collapse of a massive young star cluster ( matsushita et al .",
    "2000 ; ebisuzaki et al .",
    "2001 ) or as remnants of population  iii stars ( madau & rees 2001 ) .    here",
    "we consider the implications for gravitational wave emission if these sources are indeed intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "independent of their detailed origin , black holes in dense stellar environments are promising sources of gravitational radiation due to the diversity of dynamical interactions that are possible ( see also benacquista 1999 , 2002a , b ; benacquista , portegies zwart , & rasio 2001 ) .",
    "we will focus mainly on black holes in globular clusters , but will also address signals that may be evident from young stellar clusters , regardless of whether the black hole formed there or elsewhere . in   2 we give general arguments about the properties of these sources , based on the ages of globulars and the number and types of secondaries . in ",
    "3 we estimate the rates of encounters , and in   4 we present calculations of the signal to noise ratios expected for lisa from galactic globulars and from globulars in the virgo cluster , and for coalescence of black holes as observed with the ligo - ii detector . in   5",
    "we discuss what information could be gleaned from a reasonably high signal to noise detection .",
    "we show that both pericenter precession and lense - thirring precession are potentially measurable .",
    "these effects may allow preliminary mapping of the spacetime around black holes and could even yield an independent measure of the distance to the virgo cluster .",
    "we present our conclusions and discuss the uncertainties in our estimates in   6 .",
    "here we discuss the expected nature of intermediate - mass black holes if these are grown in dense clusters .",
    "we begin by summarizing the dynamics of dense stellar clusters and then discuss the ways in which intermediate - mass black holes can form and grow .",
    "we then derive the approximate distributions of spin parameter and eccentricity that we expect for these sources , with implications for detectability .",
    "the young super star clusters now being discovered in many galaxies with active star formation ( e.g. , origlia et al .",
    "2001 ) have typical estimated masses @xmath11 and half - mass radii 10  pc ( origlia et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the central number density is difficult to estimate , but if we take as a guide the densest young clusters in the vicinity of the milky way the central density could be up to @xmath12  pc@xmath13 ( see , e.g. , massey & hunter 1998 for observations of the dense r136 region ) .",
    "clusters with ages less than a few tens of millions of years have a large number of o and b stars ; older than this , and those stars have evolved to compact remnants .",
    "globular clusters are much older , @xmath14  yr . all stars with initial masses @xmath15 have evolved off the main sequence , meaning that the most massive objects present are compact remnants such as black holes , neutron stars , and massive white dwarfs .",
    "there are also a small number of @xmath16 blue stragglers , which are main sequence stars more massive than the ordinary main - sequence turnoff that may have been rejuvenated by collisions ( lombardi et al .",
    "2002 ; see , e.g. , hurley & shara 2002 for a recent discussion of these and other interactions in clusters ) .",
    "a typical globular has @xmath12 stars of average mass @xmath17 , and a central number density in the range @xmath18  pc@xmath13 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "roughly 40% of the globulars surrounding the milky way have @xmath19  pc@xmath13 ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) , with a density contrast between the core and the half - mass radius that formally poise them on the edge of core collapse .",
    "it is thought that three - body interactions of primordial binaries with field stars heat the cluster , delaying collapse much longer than otherwise possible ( e.g. , goodman & hut 1989 ; hut , mcmillan , & romani 1992 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) .",
    "a productive analogy with thermodynamics , backed up by simulations , has shown that in clusters with stars of different masses the cluster tries to evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium , in the sense that the kinetic energies of each of the component stars are drawn from the same distribution ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "this means that the typical speed of an object of mass @xmath20 is proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "this causes more massive objects to sink to the core of the cluster , a process called mass segregation ( e.g. , farouki & salpeter 1982 ) .",
    "the typical timescale for such sinking is given by @xmath22 , where for a cluster of @xmath23 stars and dynamical crossing time @xmath24 the core relaxation timescale is @xmath25 ( see , e.g. , binney & tremaine 1987 ) .",
    "typical globulars have @xmath26  yr ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "this means that even small black holes with @xmath27 will sink quickly to the center of a cluster , and if an intermediate - mass black hole with @xmath28 is present it will rarely be too far from the center even in a young cluster .",
    "however , the short relaxation time in the core and wandering of black holes of this mass due to dynamical interactions mean that there is rapid refilling of stellar orbits that interact with the black hole .",
    "there is therefore no  loss cone \" problem , unlike the situation with supermassive black holes in galactic nuclei ( frank & rees 1976 ; see milosavljevi & merritt 2001 for a recent discussion ) .    as a result of mass segregation , even though the absolute number of compact objects is much less than that of main sequence stars , their number density in the core can be comparable to or in excess of that of main sequence stars for core densities @xmath29  pc@xmath13 ( e.g. , sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , since binaries typically have more mass than single stars , they also tend to sink to the center .",
    "this means that three - body interactions of binaries with single stars , and possibly binary - binary interactions , can be dynamically important .",
    "qualitatively , three - body interactions can be understood using heggie s rule ( heggie 1975 ) that hard binaries harden and soft binaries soften .",
    "that is , if the initial binary has a binding energy greater than the typical kinetic energy of a field star ( i.e. , the binary is hard ) then a typical encounter with a field star will cause the binary to harden further .",
    "a soft binary will instead be softened gradually until it becomes unbound .",
    "exchanges can also occur , in which the interloper object becomes a member of the final binary .",
    "numerous simulations show that in a strong encounter the most likely occurrence is that the final binary is composed of the two most massive of the three stars that originally interacted ( e.g. , sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; heggie , hut , & mcmillan 1996 ) .",
    "there has long been interest in whether hardening from three - body encounters might bring a pair of black holes close enough together that they would merge via gravitational radiation while still in the cluster .",
    "however , each hardening delivers a recoil kick to both the binary and the single star , and if the recoil of the binary exceeds the @xmath30  km  s@xmath6 escape speed from the core of a typical dense cluster ( webbink 1985 ) then the binary will be ejected before it can merge . several simulations ( kulkarni , hut , & mcmillan 1993 ;",
    "sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) have shown that if attention is restricted to newtonian three - body encounters of @xmath31 black holes then few if any mergers will occur inside the cluster .",
    "there may , however , be a number of mergers that happen outside the cluster after recoil ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) .",
    "recently , miller & hamilton ( 2002a ) showed that merger may happen inside the cluster if a black hole starts out with a greater mass , @xmath32 . in this case , recoil is much less significant and gravitational radiation predominates .",
    "they proposed this as a mechanism for the formation and growth of intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "even if only lighter black holes form initially , secular resonances in hierarchical triple systems formed in binary - binary encounters ( the kozai resonance : kozai 1962 ; lidov & ziglin 1976 ) may increase the eccentricity of the inner binary enough that it can merge by gravitational radiation without being ejected by three - body recoil ( miller & hamilton 2002b ) .",
    "it is also possible that in some three - body encounters , two of the black holes will pass close enough to each other to coalesce rapidly .",
    "this increases optimism that dense clusters may be the seat of relatively frequent mergers of compact objects .",
    "there are , however , a number of questions still remaining .",
    "one of these has to do with recoil due to asymmetric emission of gravitational radiation during inspiral .",
    "calculations have yet to be done for strong gravity , but various analyses using newtonian and post - newtonian formalisms suggest that the recoil velocity could be from a few kilometers per second up to @xmath33  km  s@xmath6 , depending on the mass ratio and how close the black holes get before the final plunge ( peres 1962 ; bekenstein 1973 ; fitchett 1983 ; fitchett & detweiler 1984 ; redmount & rees 1989 ; wiseman 1992 ) . for slowly - rotating black holes with mass ratios @xmath34 , the prime focus of this paper ,",
    "the best estimates are that the recoil speed will be well below the 50  km  s@xmath6 escape speed from the core ( fitchett 1983 ; fitchett & detweiler 1984 ; wiseman 1992 ) .",
    "we will therefore assume that if an intermediate - mass black hole forms in a dense cluster it will remain in the core through multiple mergers .",
    "black holes that have grown by the accumulation of smaller objects in a dense stellar cluster are likely to have a different rotation parameter than either stellar - mass or supermassive black holes .",
    "stellar - mass black holes acquire some spin at birth .",
    "subsequent accretion adds relatively little mass or angular momentum to the black hole , either because not much mass is available ( as in low - mass x - ray binaries , where the companion is usually less than 10% as massive as the black hole ; e.g. , verbunt 1993 ) or because the duration of the accretion phase is short ( as in high - mass x - ray binaries , with durations @xmath35  yr implying a total mass transfer less than @xmath36 : verbunt 1993 ) . as a result ,",
    "the spin parameter @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the speed of light , @xmath39 is newton s gravitational constant , and @xmath40 is the angular momentum , of stellar - mass black holes is expected to be close to its birth value .",
    "compelling evidence of significant spin in stellar - mass black holes has emerged from study of quasi - periodic brightness oscillations ( strohmayer 2001a , b ; miller et al . 2001 ) , and spectral studies are also suggestive of high spin ( from line profiles , miller et al . 2002 ; and earlier more model - dependent fits to continuum emission , zhang , cui , & chen 1997 ) .",
    "for supermassive black holes , the spin parameter depends on what fraction of its mass was provided by an accretion disk with a fixed orientation .",
    "if the fraction is close to unity then the spin parameter could also be close to unity .",
    "some evidence of such rapidly spinning supermassive black holes is emerging in the form of extremely broad fe  k@xmath41 lines from a few active galactic nuclei ( e.g. , iwasawa et al .",
    "1996 , dabrowski et al . 1997 ; wilms et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in contrast , black holes grown by the capture of stars or compact objects in dense stellar clusters undergo a damped random walk in the evolution of their spins after the memory of the initial spin is lost .",
    "the damping is because retrograde orbits become unstable at larger specific angular momentum than do prograde orbits , so that it is easier to decrease than to increase the spin parameter of the black hole . assuming a roughly isotropic distribution of stellar velocities in the cluster core",
    ", the final inspiral and deposition of angular momentum will happen at random angles to the previous spin axis of the black hole .",
    "there is evidence of net rotation in many globular clusters ( e.g. , barmby et al .",
    "2002 ) , so that encounters may not be precisely isotropic , but this is likely to be a small effect because relaxation will drive the core distribution towards isotropy ( e.g. , einsel & spurzem 1999 ; kim et al .",
    "2002 for fokker - planck treatments of the evolution of rotating systems ) .",
    "if the angular momentum of the large black hole is much greater than the orbital angular momentum of a small black hole that falls into it , then the total angular momentum is roughly constant , so that @xmath42 ( hughes & blandford 2002 ) .",
    "in contrast , if the angular momentum of the larger black hole is sufficiently small , then the orbital angular momentum of the smaller black hole can make a significant difference .",
    "following hughes & blandford ( 2002 ) , let us define the orbital inclination @xmath43 using @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the angular momentum parallel to the spin axis of the more massive black hole and @xmath46 is the carter constant .",
    "if the initial spin angular momentum of the massive black hole is @xmath40 , then merger with a black hole of mass @xmath47 with an orbital inclination @xmath43 and specific orbital angular momentum @xmath48 will produce a black hole of mass @xmath49 and angular momentum @xmath50 this assumes that the amount of mass - energy and angular momentum radiated away during the merger is small .",
    "hughes & blandford ( 2002 ) show that to good accuracy the angular momentum of a test particle in the last stable circular orbit at angle @xmath43 to the prograde equatorial direction is approximately @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are , respectively , the specific angular momentum of a prograde equatorial and retrograde equatorial particle at the last stable orbit .",
    "when @xmath54 this reduces to @xmath55\\ ; , \\ ] ] assume the probability distribution of inclinations is @xmath56 ( e.g. , @xmath57 for an isotropic distribution ) .",
    "if the probability distribution for @xmath58 given @xmath20 , @xmath59 , is stationary in form , then we have @xmath60 q(\\cos\\iota)\\,d(\\cos\\iota)\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath61 is the change in dimensionless angular momentum caused by the accretion of an object of mass @xmath62 at an orbital inclination @xmath43 ; that is , such an object will change the dimensionless angular momentum from @xmath63 to @xmath58 .",
    "approximate solutions to this equation may be sought in the form @xmath64 $ ] . for isotropic encounters ,",
    "a fit to the numerical results displayed in figure  1 gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "figure  1 shows the distribution of spin parameters for a number of simulated black holes that started at @xmath67 and accreted objects of mass @xmath62 ( e.g. , @xmath68 and @xmath31 ) . for intermediate - mass black holes ,",
    "the expected dimensionless angular momentum is on the order of a few tenths , approximately independent of the initial spin if @xmath69 .",
    "the expected eccentricity for a black hole binary depends on the way in which it was formed and on the orbital frequency at which it is observed .",
    "we will discuss each of the evolutionary paths in turn , but in brief we find that at the high frequencies observable with ground - based detectors the orbits will have circularized to high accuracy , whereas at the lower frequencies of space - based detectors the eccentricity is expected to be significant for the majority of the detectable period .",
    "first , consider formation via three - body encounters .",
    "as long as the time to merger is longer than the time to the next encounter , the eccentricity will be reset by each interaction . during this period",
    "there will be relatively little gravitational radiation emitted , as the merger time is typically long . at some point",
    ", however , an encounter leaves the binary with a relatively short merger time and thus the binary goes into uninterrupted two - body inspiral .",
    "the precise distribution of eccentricities at the start of this phase depends on the details of the three - body interactions , but preliminary results ( gultekin & miller , in preparation ) suggest that immediately after the last three - body encounter the eccentricity tends to be fairly high , @xmath70 .",
    "this is because the time to merger decreases rapidly with increasing eccentricity , so a chance fluctuation up to high eccentricity will allow a binary to merge before the next encounter . for moderate to high eccentricities the gravitational radiation merger time is @xmath71 ( peters 1964 ) , where @xmath20 is the total mass and @xmath72 is the reduced mass of the binary . for @xmath73",
    "this is @xmath74  yr , where @xmath75 is the pericenter distance . for a typical merger time , after the last encounter , of a few hundred thousand to a few million years , the pericenter distance is therefore @xmath76  cm , which is hundreds to thousands of gravitational radii for an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "although the full period of an orbit could be relatively high ( @xmath77  s ) , the majority of the power is emitted at a frequency of the order of the angular frequency at pericenter ( see   4.1 ) , which could be several times higher than the fundamental orbital frequency .",
    "the peak frequency of gravitational waves is then typically on the order of @xmath78  hz for the majority of the inspiral .",
    "this is what would most likely be seen from sources in our galactic globular system , and hence the eccentricity would be expected to be high , perhaps typically @xmath70 .    in later stages of inspiral",
    ", however , the circularizing influence of gravitational radiation reduces the eccentricity substantially . a simple way to estimate the eccentricity uses the constant @xmath79 found by peters ( 1964 ) for",
    "the lowest - order quadrupole radiation ( see glampedakis & kennefick 2002 and glampedakis , hughes , & kennefick 2002 for a discussion of how constant this expression is when higher - order terms are included )",
    ". disregarding factors of order unity , this means that @xmath80 is roughly constant .",
    "thus , @xmath81 remains approximately fixed as long as @xmath82 is close to unity , after which point it drops significantly . in the first stage , where @xmath83 , @xmath84 so that @xmath85 .",
    "note that in this stage the emission is strongly dominated by the time near pericenter .",
    "thus , gravitational waves are emitted for a few cycles near closest approach , then little emission occurs until the next pericenter passage . as a result ,",
    "the peak frequency of the gravitational wave emission is approximately the orbital frequency at pericenter , which is nearly constant during this phase of inspiral . in the second stage , where @xmath86 and thus @xmath87 , we have @xmath88 . here",
    "the frequency of gravitational waves is roughly twice the mean orbital frequency , or @xmath89 , so @xmath90 .    in practice",
    ", the transition between relatively rapid change in eccentricity and relatively slow change happens at surprisingly high eccentricity .",
    "for example , suppose the binary initially has a merger time of @xmath91  yr and an eccentricity of 0.9 . at @xmath92  yr from merger ,",
    "the eccentricity would be @xmath93 , at @xmath94  yr from merger @xmath95 , and at @xmath96  yr @xmath97 .",
    "if the initial eccentricity is instead 0.99 , then at @xmath92  yr @xmath98 , at @xmath94  yr @xmath99 , and at @xmath96  yr @xmath100 .",
    "the net result is that almost all the sources of this type in the lisa band are likely to have appreciable eccentricity .",
    "in contrast , high frequency sources detectable by ground - based instruments will have much lower eccentricities , @xmath101 typically .",
    "this means that templates based on circular orbits will be adequate for many purposes ( see martel & poisson 1999 for a discussion of the amount of signal to noise lost by nonoptimal signal processing ) .",
    "a second formation scenario involves kozai resonances in hierarchical triple systems formed by binary - binary encounters ( miller & hamilton 2002b ) . here",
    "the eccentricities could be much higher and the pericenter distances much closer than in the three - body scenario .",
    "however , the eccentricities will certainly not be higher than what would produce a merger within a single orbital period of the inner binary , because the eccentricity is increased gradually and such a short merger time would terminate the increase . for a merger time of @xmath102  yr and two @xmath31 black holes , this implies a pericenter distance of @xmath103  cm . even in this very extreme case , by the time the binary reached the @xmath104  cm separation necessary to bring the frequency into the ligo - ii detector band the eccentricity would be @xmath105 . in more realistic circumstances the pericenter distance would be more than @xmath106  cm and the binary would again be nearly circular when it entered the frequency range of ground - based detectors .",
    "the third formation scenario involves direct two - body capture by emission of gravitational radiation .",
    "if this happens with a black hole of mass @xmath20 and one of mass @xmath47 , then the distance of closest approach needed to cause a binary of initial relative velocity @xmath107 to become bound is ( see quinlan & shapiro 1987 ) @xmath108 where @xmath109 and @xmath110 . here",
    "@xmath111 is the speed at infinity in units of @xmath91  cm  s@xmath6 . for stellar - mass or intermediate - mass black holes ,",
    "this distance is so much larger than the radius @xmath112  cm of the last stable orbit that , again , when the frequency is high enough to detect with ground - based instruments the orbit will have circularized to @xmath113 .",
    "note that because @xmath114 whereas the horizon radius @xmath115 , for supermassive black holes there is a point at which in order to become bound the smaller object would have to pass inside the horizon , so that a direct capture occurs .",
    "this happens at @xmath116 , and means that above this mass one will not observe multiple orbits .",
    "if two - body capture happens during a three - body interaction , the criterion is that the capture must occur before a slight perturbation from the third object can deflect the binary from its highly eccentric orbit .",
    "this means that the merger time must be less than @xmath117  yr . for such short merger times there is a significant probability that the pericenter distance will be comparable to the radius of the last stable orbit .",
    "this is in part because in the gravitational focusing regime the cross section for a closest approach @xmath81 scales as @xmath81 and not @xmath118 .",
    "however , we expect these to form a minor fraction of the coalescences observed with ground - based detectors .    in summary ,",
    "all of the scenarios above predict that when a binary is orbiting with high frequency its eccentricity will be small enough for the use of circular orbit templates . at the frequencies detectable with lisa",
    ", however , we expect significant eccentricities to be typical .",
    "what is the rate at which intermediate - mass black holes are expected to merge with less massive compact objects ?",
    "the actual rate in a given cluster is set by the frequency of encounters , which depends on number densities and effective cross sections .",
    "however , if this rate is too high then it is self - limiting .",
    "one upper limit is set by the supply of smaller objects ; this supply can not be exhausted much faster than the current age of the cluster .",
    "another upper limit is set by the mass of the large black hole ; the characteristic growth time of the black hole can not be much shorter than the current cluster age .",
    "we now consider these in turn .",
    "the encounter rate includes contributions from two - body capture by gravitational radiation and from three - body encounters .",
    "consider first two - body interactions .",
    "if the smaller objects have number densities @xmath119  pc@xmath13 , and if they are in thermal equilibrium with @xmath17 main sequence stars with a velocity dispersion of @xmath120 cm  s@xmath6 ( so that the velocity dispersion of the black holes is @xmath121  cm  s@xmath6 ) , then the rate of two - body capture by a given large black hole is @xmath122 ( e.g. , quinlan & shapiro 1987 ; miller & hamilton 2002a )",
    ". the typical rate can therefore be @xmath123  yr@xmath6 , depending on the cluster parameters and black hole masses .",
    "now consider three - body interactions .",
    "if the large black hole is initially solitary , it will acquire a companion when it interacts strongly with an existing binary , where  strongly \" means roughly a closest approach less than the semimajor axis @xmath124 of the binary .",
    "the interactions are dominated by gravitational focusing , so the cross section for a close approach within distance @xmath124 is roughly @xmath125 , where @xmath126  cm  s@xmath6 is the velocity at infinity . for a moderately hard binary with @xmath124=1  au ( and thus an orbital velocity of 30  km  s@xmath6 ) , this cross section is about @xmath127  @xmath128 .",
    "if 10% of stars are in binaries , their number density is about @xmath129  cm@xmath13 , so the interaction time is @xmath131=5\\times 10^{12}v_6m_{100}^{-1}n_6^{-1}$ ]  s. if the relative velocity of binaries with large black holes is somewhat smaller than the main sequence velocity dispersion ( due to the higher mass of binaries ) , this is typically @xmath132  yr .",
    "once the massive black hole is in a binary , the question is how long it will take for subsequent interactions to harden it so that it merges because of gravitational radiation .",
    "since there is not a significant loss cone for objects of this mass , the black hole can now interact with all the stars ( density @xmath133  cm@xmath13 ) , so at least at first the interaction rate is about 1 per @xmath134  yr . the fractional hardening per interaction is small because of the large mass ratio , but the eccentricity can increase substantially ( quinlan 1996 ) . depending on how the eccentricity evolves , merger within a few hundred interactions is likely to be typical . for a @xmath135 black hole",
    "this will give rates of @xmath136 mergers per year , with lower rates for less massive black holes .",
    "thus , the overall rate of interactions is likely to be dominated by three - body encounters , but the merger rate could have a significant contribution from two - body contributions as well because such an interaction leads to a direct merger .",
    "a model - independent upper limit on the rate of mergers is set by the requirement that the characteristic timescale on which the smaller objects are removed from the population can not be much shorter than the age of the cluster , otherwise the population would be reduced rapidly .",
    "for example , suppose the central black hole has a mass of @xmath137 and we consider its interactions with neutron stars , of which we assume there are @xmath96 currently in the cluster ( and at most a few hundred in the core ) . for a @xmath138  yr old cluster",
    "the interaction rate is therefore limited to not much more than one per @xmath139  yr , and could be less . of course , if other processes are more important then the rate could be much less than these values , but the rate can not be much more .",
    "for example , if the process of merging with one neutron star has along the way caused the ejection of 100 neutron stars ( e.g. , through three - body recoil ) , the maximum rate drops to one per @xmath106  yr .",
    "the rate is therefore @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the current number of small objects of a given type in the cluster and @xmath142 is the current cluster age .",
    "similarly , the timescale of increase in the mass of the central black hole can not be much shorter than the cluster age , otherwise the massive black hole would acquire mass rapidly and grow until it exhausted its fuel . in the example",
    "above , if neutron stars are accreted faster than one per @xmath143  yr , the black hole mass will grow well past its current @xmath137 in a hubble time .",
    "thus , @xmath144 , where @xmath62 is the mass of the objects accreted .",
    "this provides a guide to the most common expected interactions between an intermediate - mass black hole and other compact objects . because exchange interactions tend to favor more massive objects , the companion to an intermediate - mass black hole is likely to be among the more massive objects present in abundance in the core of the cluster .",
    "if there are enough stellar - mass black holes ( say , tens to hundreds ) , then in dense clusters these may dominate the actual merger rate even if most of the encounters are with other types of stars . if the number of stellar - mass black holes is smaller , then neutron stars ( with perhaps @xmath145 in a cluster ; grindlay et al .",
    "2001 ) or massive white dwarfs ( which could constitute several percent of the number of stars , or up to @xmath146 in a cluster ) may dominate the interactions . as we will see in   4 , mergers between two black holes will provide most of the signal for high - frequency ground - based detectors , whereas the more frequent interactions between a neutron star or white dwarf and an intermediate - mass black hole will likely provide most of the signal for lower - frequency space - based instruments . note that for frequencies in the majority of the lisa band white dwarfs act as point masses .",
    "tidal disruption occurs at the roche separation @xmath147 , where @xmath148  cm is the radius of the white dwarf .",
    "this implies a gravitational wave frequency @xmath149  hz independent of the mass of the black hole . below this frequency",
    "white dwarfs can make a clean contribution to gravitational wave signals in the lisa band .",
    "the instantaneous rate of mergers is governed by @xmath150 , but as the supply is decreased and the black hole mass is increased the encounter rate can change in response .",
    "in addition to simply decreasing the number of smaller objects with which the large black hole interacts , three - body effects inject energy into the population that tend to increase the scale height of that population .",
    "the compact objects that interact with the black hole will settle back via interactions with normal stars , but as the black hole mass increases the rate of energy injection per object increases .",
    "this is primarily because the fractional change in binding energy per encounter scales roughly as @xmath151 ( quinlan 1996 ) .",
    "the binding energy released before subsequent encounters actually eject the interloper object therefore scales roughly as @xmath20 .",
    "thus , if the initial encounter rate is high it will decrease until it matches approximately the characteristic time of depletion and of mass increase .    for ground - based detectors , which can see just the last few seconds at most of a merger",
    ", it is only the overall rate that matters .",
    "in contrast , for space - based detectors one must also know the distribution of time to merger for a given class of system . to estimate this ,",
    "suppose that for a given type of secondaries one can establish the typical time @xmath152 between mergers .",
    "if the probability of a given system being a time @xmath153 away from merger is given by a poisson distribution , then @xmath154 .",
    "for example , consider a @xmath135 black hole interacting with a population of @xmath96 neutron stars of mass @xmath155 .",
    "the maximum rate of interaction is roughly one per @xmath139  yr ; if this rate is realized in a particular cluster , the probability of that cluster having a system less than @xmath91  yr away from merger is 10% . the implied signal to noise ratio for lisa , however , depends on the eccentricity of the system , which we examine in the next section .",
    "note that a young dense cluster of age @xmath156  yr has much less serious constraints placed on interaction rates by supply limits and mass growth timescales . however , the maximum rate is still limited by the encounter frequency itself . within @xmath157",
    "years a massive young cluster may be able to evolve to high density in the core , without having yet ejected many compact objects by three - body processes ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) . in principle , therefore , some young clusters could have interaction rates an order of magnitude larger than those for globulars . to be conservative , however , we will assume that the overall rate of mergers or inspirals from young clusters is at most comparable to that for globulars .",

    "the majority of the inspiral is detectable only with low - frequency instruments such as lisa .",
    "signal to noise estimates for lisa are complicated by the expectation of a significant background of astrophysical sources , especially white dwarf binaries ( phinney 2001 ) .",
    "as the detector acquires data and frequency resolution becomes better due to the longer observational baseline , individual sources can be identified .",
    "they can therefore be removed from the data stream , so that the unresolved background will effectively diminish in strength . however , until that point the true signal to noise is less than what would be computed from the instrumental curve alone , particularly for @xmath175  hz , where the white dwarf background is expected to make its strongest contribution .",
    "there are also numerous other sources , especially coalescing supermassive black holes , that may produce a strong astrophysical background over much of the lisa frequency range ( e.g. , phinney 2001 ; hughes 2002 ) . as with the white dwarf sources ,",
    "in the course of the lifetime of the experiment such individual sources can be accounted for in analysis , so that the effective sensitivity of lisa to other sources will improve with time . for the estimates in this section ,",
    "we consider only the expected instrumental noise curve ( kindly provided by r. stebbins ) .",
    "we also consider only the far - field inspiral . for inspiral effects at smaller distances , including",
    "the effects of black hole spin , see , e.g. , finn & thorne ( 2000 ) and hughes ( 2001 ) .    as is evident from   4.1",
    ", the detectability of a signal depends strongly on its frequency distribution and amplitude , because of the strong frequency dependence of the detector sensitivity ( e.g. , danzmann 2000 ) .",
    "in particular , the harmonic content of the signal is important ; orbits with high eccentricities have important contributions at frequencies many times the orbital frequency .",
    "for example , an orbital frequency of @xmath176  hz is far below the most sensitive range of lisa , but for @xmath177 most of the power is in the @xmath178  hz range where the s / n=5 threshold in a one year observation is a dimensionless strain of @xmath179 .    if the time to merger is more than about @xmath91  yr , then the signal to noise ratio from a source at a fixed distance in a year s integration with lisa depends on the merger time but is insensitive to other parameters such as the individual masses or the eccentricity . to show this , note that @xmath180 , where @xmath181 is the luminosity and @xmath182 is the frequency , and that at the low - frequency end the strain that gives a signal to noise ratio of 5 in a one year integration is @xmath183 for frequencies less than @xmath184  hz@xmath6 ( r. stebbins , personal communication ) . if @xmath172 and @xmath185 , then the merger time is @xmath186 and the frequency of peak emission is @xmath187 . for simplicity ,",
    "assume that all the power in the signal is concentrated at @xmath188",
    ". then @xmath189 the weak dependence on the masses and eccentricity arises because of competing effects .",
    "for example , at a fixed merger time a binary with a high eccentricity will have a large semimajor axis ( and thus low fundamental frequency ) , but the frequency peak is at a high harmonic .",
    "a binary with a low eccentricity will have a small semimajor axis and thus high fundamental frequency , but the frequency peak is at a low harmonic . in both cases",
    "the frequency peak is about the same . at merger times @xmath190  yr , however , the signal to noise is larger for more circular binaries because the frequency peak is greater than or about the optimal frequency @xmath191  hz for lisa , and the signal to noise is greater when the signal is concentrated into few frequency bins .",
    "the total signal to noise is the square root of the sum of the squares of the signal to noise ratios for each of the harmonics . to compute the signal to noise we therefore need to ( 1 )  pick an eccentricity and merger time , ( 2 )  calculate the frequency distribution and dimensionless strain amplitudes for the harmonics , ( 3 )  take the ratio with the expected lisa sensitivity at each frequency , and ( 4 )  sum these in quadrature for the final signal to noise .",
    "the computation of a cumulative signal to noise plot thus requires assumptions about the distribution of eccentricities for a given merger time , although from the calculation above this only makes a significant difference if @xmath190  yr .    as a sample calculation ,",
    "let us assume that for large merger time the probability distribution of eccentricities is the thermal distribution @xmath192 that emerges from close interactions of three equal - mass objects ( heggie 1975 ) .",
    "we expect that this will underestimate the eccentricity for large merger times , where the eccentricity may be pushed to higher values by many small interactions ( quinlan 1996 ) . at merger times",
    "much less than the typical time between encounters , the eccentricity will decrease due to gravitational radiation .",
    "as mentioned earlier , peters ( 1964 ) showed that to lowest order the eccentricity and semimajor axis evolve so as to keep the expression @xmath193 constant . combining this with the expression for merger time , we take as an approximation that when @xmath194 , the eccentricity is diminished by @xmath195 .",
    "we assume that the merger time is given by a poisson distribution , @xmath196 , where @xmath152 is the typical time between mergers as defined above . given the limits of growth of the black hole and consumption of the secondaries , we use @xmath197  yr for @xmath198 and @xmath199 .",
    "this is the minimum value of @xmath152 allowed , so if the time is greater the contours are moved to the left in figure  2 . in all cases , we fix the distance to the globular at 10  kpc , a representative distance to the globulars around our galaxy ( actual distances vary from 2.2  kpc to 122  kpc , with roughly 55% being less than 10  kpc distant ; see harris 1996 ) .",
    "-0.3truein    if these curves are roughly representative , it suggests that globulars of at least moderate density will have a significant probability of containing a high signal to noise gravitational wave source , especially if @xmath135 black holes are common . in a ten - year lisa integration the signal to noise ratio would be greater than 10 for @xmath200% of the galactic globulars that have @xmath135 black holes and a significant supply of @xmath201 compact objects",
    ". this could be several tens of globulars around our galaxy . over ten years the strongest of the sources could have an accumulated signal to noise of several hundred .",
    "there is also a chance to detect inspiraling intermediate - mass black hole binaries at greater distances with lisa .",
    "for example , the virgo cluster , at a distance @xmath20216  mpc ( e.g. , graham et al .",
    "1999 ) , contains @xmath203 galaxies and @xmath204 globulars ( using the mass fraction @xmath205 of mclaughlin 1999 ) . from the model above",
    ", we expect there to be a few binaries within @xmath203  yr of merging , which would therefore have signal to noise ratios @xmath206 in a single year lisa integration . as we discuss in",
    "  5 , such binaries are likely to have appreciable eccentricities and detectable frame - dragging , so that there are a number of interesting strong gravity effects that may be probed .      as discussed in",
    "  2 , coalescing binary black holes in dense stellar clusters may contain intermediate - mass black holes or may consist of two stellar - mass black holes ( via the kozai mechanism or due to a close pass in a two- or three - body interaction ) .",
    "we first treat intermediate - mass black holes , then discuss the possible rates for stellar - mass black hole coalescence .    by the time that a binary with an intermediate - mass black hole is in the frequency range of a ground - based instrument , it will have shrunk through a large enough factor in pericenter distance that the orbit will be nearly circular . as discussed by flanagan & hughes ( 1998a , b ) and cutler & thorne ( 2002 )",
    ", the remaining coalescence can then be conveniently divided into inspiral ( where analytical calculations are adequate ) , merger ( where numerical simulations are mandatory because of strong gravity effects ) , and ringdown ( where analytic theory exists ) .",
    "the boundary between inspiral and merger is somewhat arbitrary , but it can be said to be roughly where the inward radial speed increases rapidly ( see ori & thorne 2000 ) .",
    "flanagan & hughes ( 1998a ) conservatively assume that the inspiral is ended when the orbital frequency becomes @xmath207 ; we discuss later the effects of spin on this number .",
    "it is likely that radiation of significant energy and angular momentum in a merger phase requires that the total angular momentum of the system exceed the kerr threshold for the total mass of the system ( s. hughes , personal communication ) . from the work of pfeiffer , teukolsky , & cook ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the orbital angular momentum at the last quasicircular orbit between two black holes ( with total mass @xmath20 and reduced mass @xmath72 ) is @xmath208 , depending on the initial spin magnitudes and orientations . even for equal masses , @xmath209",
    ", this is not enough by itself to exceed the kerr maximum of @xmath210 , and hence the black holes must be prograde and spinning fairly rapidly for there to be a hangup phase before final merger ( s. hughes , personal communication ) . for the higher mass ratio inspirals that are the main focus here , it is probably impossible to exceed the kerr threshold unless the larger black hole is already close to maximally rotating .",
    "it is therefore likely that there will be no merger radiation per se , but that any excess energy or angular momentum would be emitted in an extended ringdown phase .",
    "however , in order to be complete we will include estimates of the detectability assuming that a merger - like phase releases an energy that we scale to a fraction @xmath211 of the total mass - energy of the system ( following the estimate by flanagan & hughes 1998a ) .",
    "similarly , the ringdown energy is scaled to a fraction @xmath212 of the total mass - energy .    for a given @xmath20 and @xmath72 ,",
    "there is a luminosity distance out to which each of these phases can be detected with a given instrument with a signal to noise ratio of at least 10 . from flanagan & hughes ( 1998a ) , for the advanced ligo instrument these luminosity distances for a source at redshift @xmath213 are @xmath214 the actual formulae are more complicated but these expressions are reasonably accurate over the @xmath215 range of interest ( except for ringdown , which scales as @xmath20 above @xmath216 and @xmath21 above @xmath217 ) .",

    "note that the rapid increase in number with diminishing signal to noise ratio means that for the purposes of statistical analysis these will dominate the constraints possible with these data .",
    "similar answers are obtained for more general power laws , @xmath244 .",
    "note that the division of numbers between inspiral and merger is based on the conservative assumption that inspiral continues only to a frequency @xmath245 ( flanagan & hughes 1998a ) , which is the frequency at the innermost stable circular orbit for a test particle around a nonrotating black hole . as shown in   2.2 ,",

    "for example , in a 10 year integration lisa would be expected to see several to tens of objects in the last phase of their inspiral .",
    "this leads to the interesting possibility that a @xmath253 black hole coalescing with a @xmath31 black hole may be observed with lisa a few years prior to merger , then its final merger could be seen later with ground - based instruments .",
    "the waveform observed with lisa could be projected to the final merger , so that the time , phase , and other characteristics could be anticipated and detected with ground - based gravitational wave detectors and the region could be observed simultaneously with conventional telescopes .",
    "given that the angular resolution of lisa would at best be a few degrees for these sources ( e.g. , cutler 1998 ) , it may be necessary to employ wide - field monitoring to catch the final merger .",
    "we note that detection of any significant electromagnetic radiation during the merger would require a profound revision of our understanding of these systems and possibly of gravitational radiation itself . in a globular cluster",
    "the gas density is too low for there to be meaningful accretion from the interstellar medium .",
    "if at one point there was a substantial accretion disk around either compact object , it is likely that it would have been completely disrupted or accreted by the time of the final merger .",
    "in addition , gravitational radiation is not thought to couple significantly to an electromagnetic field , so negligible photon luminosity is expected from the final merger .",
    "if instead there is an electromagnetic counterpart to a merger of an intermediate - mass black hole with a neutron star or stellar - mass black hole , parts of this picture must be revised .",
    "let us now turn from interactions of intermediate - mass black holes to interactions among only stellar - mass black holes .",
    "as before , there is an upper limit to the rate set by the timescale in which the supply of stellar - mass black holes is used up .",
    "for example , if a cluster contains @xmath254 stellar - mass black holes , a strong upper bound on the binary black hole merger rate by any mechanism is @xmath255  yr@xmath6 assuming that the supply is not exhausted in much less than a hubble time .",
    "the actual rate depends on details .",
    "consider for example merger by the kozai mechanism after a binary - binary encounter ( miller & hamilton 2002b ) .",
    "the rate is proportional to the square of the fraction of black holes in binaries .",
    "if most black holes are in binaries then the rate could be several tens of percent of the maximum ( see miller & hamilton 2002b ) .",
    "if the fraction in binaries is @xmath256 , then , the rate per cluster is @xmath257  yr@xmath6 .",
    "we expect that the clusters that contribute most to the rate of stellar black hole coalescences will be those with relatively high central densities , because low - density clusters will have a low interaction rate .",
    "let us parameterize the fraction of clusters that contribute significantly as @xmath182 , where @xmath182 is likely to be a few tenths .",
    "note that the denser clusters are also the ones most likely to produce intermediate - mass black holes , hence it is likely that @xmath258 , but to keep the processes distinct we use different variables to represent the fractions .",
    "the volume rate in the universe for mergers of two stellar - mass black holes via the kozai mechanism is then @xmath259 yr@xmath6 . the other way stellar - mass black holes can coalesce in a cluster is by having a near approach during a three - body encounter .",
    "as estimated in   6 , the rate of such coalescences will be roughly 10% the rate at which black holes are ejected from the cluster by dynamic recoil . using the bounding estimates of portegies zwart & mcmillan ( 2001 ; their eqns . 8 and 9 ) , this implies a rate in the universe of @xmath260  yr@xmath6 .",
    "thus , if @xmath261 then the kozai mechanism dominates , otherwise direct coalescence in three - body interactions is more important . from flanagan & hughes ( 1998a )",

    "the high expected eccentricities of binaries in the lisa band imply that it may be possible to observe precession of the pericenter much deeper in a gravitational well than is possible for known galactic neutron star binaries .",

    "when the same binary has a merger time of @xmath96  yr ( and therefore has @xmath270 ) , only two days of observation are required .",
    "this suggests that binaries in the virgo cluster , which are numerous enough for @xmath271  yr to be probable , are good candidates for observation of pericenter precession , and that such precession may also be observable in our own galactic globular system .      the lense - thirring precession rate , at which the axis of the orbital plane changes , is approximately @xmath272 .",
    "integrated over an orbit of semimajor axis @xmath124 and eccentricity @xmath82 , the average rate is @xmath273 $ ] . as is evident from the formulae in   4.1 , the signature of such precession would be a periodic change in the relative amplitudes in the two polarizations as the angle @xmath274 varies .",
    "for precession of more than a radian to occur during an observation time @xmath275 therefore requires @xmath276 thus it will typically be difficult to detect this effect in galactic globulars unless the signal to noise ratio is so high that precession of @xmath277  radians can be detected .",
    "however , a binary in the virgo cluster with a @xmath201 and a @xmath135 black hole with @xmath278 that will merge within @xmath96  yr will require @xmath279  yr of observation , so this is well within reach .",
    "an even better hope of detecting lense - thirring precession lies in characterization of the inspiral waveform with a ground - based detector such as the advanced ligo detector .",
    "the ratio of lense - thirring to orbital frequency is @xmath280 for nearly circular orbits , so if the expected tens to hundreds of orbits of inspiral are observed then the precession of the orbital plane should be evident .",
    "the high inclination orbits expected in this scenario are sensitive to the multipole moments of the mass distribution and may therefore test the no - hair theorem ( ryan 1996 ) , although signal to noise ratios of tens are typically required for significant constraints in a single inspiral ( ryan 1997 ) .",
    "nonetheless , statistical combination of the constraints from observations of multiple mergers , even at relatively low signal to noise , could provide interesting limits .",
    "observations of these orbits may therefore allow initial mapping of spacetime around rotating black holes ( particular in the final merger detectable with ground - based instruments ) , a job expected to be completed with high precision by lisa observations of stellar - mass black holes being consumed by supermassive black holes in galactic centers ( hughes 2001 ) .      for binaries close to the end of their inspiral , the orbital frequency could change enough during @xmath281  yr that the inspiral is detected .",

    "requires that @xmath284 , or @xmath285 with some luck ( specifically @xmath286  yr ) this may be observable within the galactic globular system , but once again the virgo cluster binaries are excellent candidates , where at signal to noise ratios greater than 10 the decay of the orbit will be clear in the signal .",
    "one can combine the three effects discussed in this section to speculate about astrophysical information that might be available from gravitational radiation .",
    "an interesting possibility is that the distance to the virgo cluster could be estimated from gravitational wave signals alone , with an accuracy that is competitive with optical measurements . alternatively , using optically measured distances as an input , the system is overdetermined and detection of pericenter precession and orbital decay would allow strong consistency checks of the underlying formulae .",
    "suppose that lisa is operational for ten years .",
    "then , from the estimates in   4 , there will be several sources in virgo that are detectable with lisa with a signal to noise of s / n@xmath287 in that ten year period .",
    "with such a high signal to noise , the modulation due to the orbit of the earth will localize the sources to within several degrees , and the membership in virgo will be based on this association . from the discussion of black hole spin and binary eccentricity in   2 ,",
    "the typical eccentricity for such binaries would be @xmath288 , and the typical spin parameter would be @xmath289 .",
    "thus pericenter precession , lense - thirring precession , and decay of the orbit would all be detectable .",
    "the eccentricity would be evident from the waveform .",
    "this means that the combinations @xmath290 ( from the frequency ) , @xmath291 ( from pericenter precession ) , and @xmath292 $ ] ( from decay of the orbit ) are all independently measurable .",
    "combining these , @xmath124 , @xmath62 , and @xmath20 would all be determined . along with the strength of the waves at the detector",
    ", this would yield an estimate of the distance to the cluster from the gravitational radiation alone ( for discussion of globular cluster distance determinations using gravitational waves , see benacquista 2000 ) .",
    "it will also be possible to estimate the spin angular momentum of the larger black hole from lense - thirring precession .",
    "dense stellar clusters are promising locations for sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "we estimate that up to several tens of times per year , the advanced ligo detector will see the coalescence of a small black hole with a larger one ( a few to tens during inspiral , and most of the rest during merger , with both numbers dependent on black hole spin ) .",
    "mergers of two stellar - mass black holes in clusters will likely be detectable at a rate of a few per year . as always in astrophysical scenarios there are sources of uncertainty .",
    "the most major is the question of the number of black holes that are to be expected in a dense cluster , whether in the @xmath293 stellar - mass range or the @xmath294 intermediate - mass range .",
    "perhaps the most easily calculable input to this question is the number of black holes that are originally produced . if the initial mass function for the cluster was the salpeter function @xmath295 above @xmath201 and flatter below @xmath201 ( e.g. , meyer et al .",
    "2000 ) , then approximately 0.1% of stars began with @xmath296 and presumably evolved into black holes .",
    "if the initial mass function was instead the scalo ( 1986 ) distribution , which drops off more sharply at higher masses , the fraction with @xmath296 is more like 0.05% ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) .",
    "current dense clusters have @xmath297 stars , and may have had several times more at birth , so the number of stars that evolved into black holes is typically @xmath203 .",
    "there are , however , numerous ways in which black holes may be lost from the cluster .",
    "the first is in the supernova that produced the black hole .",
    "neutron stars are known to have significant birth kicks of tens to hundreds of km  s@xmath6 ( e.g. , hansen & phinney 1997 ; fryer & kalogera 1997 ) .",
    "the mechanism for this is still debated ( spruit & phinney 1998 ; kusenko & segre 1999 ; lai , chernoff , & cordes 2001 ) , but it is thought that similar kick velocities for black holes are much smaller ( e.g. , brandt , podsiadlowski , & sigurdsson 1995 ; podsiadlowski et al . 2002 ; see nelemans , tauris , & van den heuvel 1999 for a somewhat different perspective ) , if for no other reason than that black holes are several times more massive than neutron stars so that a fixed energy or momentum in the kick would lead to reduced speeds .",
    "it is therefore plausible that black holes do not receive birth kicks of @xmath298  km  s@xmath6 , in which case they are retained in the cluster .",
    "a second loss mechanism involves three - body recoil .",
    "several simulations have shown that black holes of a fixed mass @xmath293 in binaries with other such black holes tend to be ejected by three - body interactions before they can merge by gravitational radiation ( kulkarni et al .",
    "1993 ; sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) . the actual fraction of ejected black holes can depend on the mass function of stars and other variables , but recent estimates suggest that 10% or more of the initial black holes can be retained by their clusters over a hubble time ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) . if more massive black holes are present initially , then miller & hamilton ( 2002a ) showed that they are usually not ejected .",
    "these can grow by mergers after multiple three - body encounters , but typically they will eject several to tens of field stars along the way . the majority of the encounters , however , will not be with black holes so this mechanism is not expected to deplete the black hole supply significantly .",
    "there are , in addition , at least two ways in which multibody interactions can produce a merger without accompanying dynamical recoil .",
    "one , discussed by miller & hamilton ( 2002b ) , is that binary - binary interactions can produce a stable hierarchical triple system , and if the inclination of the orbit of the tertiary to the orbit of the inner binary is in the right range then a secular kozai resonance can increase the eccentricity of the inner binary to the extent that it merges before the next encounter , without significant recoil .",
    "the impact of this effect depends on the binary fraction and the distribution of inclinations ( see miller & hamilton 2002b ) , but this could allow the merger of some tens of percent of the original population of black holes .",
    "the other recoilless possibility involves resonant encounters in three - body interactions , in which the three objects orbit hundreds or thousands of times before resolving into a binary and an unbound single star . if , during these orbits , two black holes pass close enough to each other that losses to gravitational radiation in a single pass cause rapid merger , then again there is no dynamical kick .",
    "various estimates suggest that in an equal - mass three - body encounter the probability of the closest approach being less than @xmath299 times the initial semimajor axis is @xmath300 ( hut 1984 ; mcmillan 1986 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ) .",
    "two @xmath31 black holes must approach to within @xmath301  cm to merge in a year , which will happen in a given resonant encounter with a probability of a few tenths of a percent for a semimajor axis of a few astronomical units .",
    "if it takes @xmath281 equal - mass encounters to harden a binary to the point of ejection , this suggests that several percent of binaries will merge before ejection in this fashion . combining all of the above effects",
    ", it seems likely that tens of percent of the original black hole population will not be ejected by three - body recoil , leaving a present - day population of hundreds .",
    "the third loss mechanism involves the merger itself . the emission of gravitational waves during inspiral and merger will be somewhat asymmetric , leading to recoil .",
    "calculations thus far have focused on the weak - field limit .",
    "they suggest that in the post - newtonian limit the kick scales as @xmath302 with the separation @xmath303 at the last orbit before dynamical instability . at the separation @xmath304 appropriate for test particles around slowly rotating black holes , the kick will be a few kilometers per second for the mass ratio @xmath305 that maximizes the kick ( fitchett 1983 ; wiseman 1992 ) .",
    "binaries with large mass ratios or nearly equal masses experience less recoil ( for example , by symmetry , equal - mass binaries have no kick ) . also , @xmath303 is greater in a comparable - mass binary than in the test particle limit ( pfeiffer et al . 2000 ) , which also decreases the kick .",
    "it is not clear what level of recoil is to be expected in the merger phase , where the radial velocity becomes rapid .",
    "strong - field calculations are required to resolve whether this process is dominant ( perhaps kicking most merging black holes out of the cluster ) or insignificant ( if the recoil speeds are much less than the @xmath306  km  s@xmath6 escape speeds from the core ) .",
    "thus , if mergers do not kick black holes out of dense clusters , one may expect at least tens to hundreds of black holes in many current systems .",
    "these are expected to reside primarily in the core of the cluster , where they have a greater tendency to interact with the more massive ( and hence compact ) objects in the cluster .",
    "this may explain why no definitive examples of black hole low - mass x - ray binaries are known in the globular cluster systems of the milky way or andromeda ; such a population would not undergo mass transfer and would thus be observable only by its gravitational wave emission .",
    "note , however , that there is a population of @xmath307  erg  s@xmath6 sources in the globulars around a number of ellipticals ( angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky 2001 ; white , sarazin , & kulkarni 2002 ; kundu , maccarone , & zepf 2002 ) .",
    "possible differences between these systems are an important subject for future study .    what about the fraction of clusters with intermediate - mass black holes ?",
    "miller & hamilton ( 2002a ) estimate that clusters with central densities greater than @xmath204  pc@xmath13 have high enough encounter rates to produce @xmath10 black holes . in the milky way globular system , this would imply that roughly 40% of globulars could host such objects ( pryor & meylan 1993 ) .",
    "however , to be conservative , we have adopted 10% as our fiducial value for the estimates of merger rates .",
    "we have also been conservative in assuming that the number density and mass of globulars is the same out to 2 - 3  gpc as it is in the local universe .",
    "as first discussed by aguilar , hut , ostriker ( 1988 ) , evaporation and tidal interactions attenuate the globular system of a galaxy . therefore",
    ", it is possible that coalescence rates a few billion years ago were higher by up to a factor of a few than they are now ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) , but this is highly uncertain .",
    "the general model described here is one that can be tested and enhanced in ways both observational and theoretical . from the observational standpoint it is important to continue kinematic work on globulars to look for evidence of the velocity and density cusps that are expected signatures of black holes ( bahcall & wolf 1975 ; frank & rees 1976 ; see gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 , damico et al .",
    "2002 for recent results ) . further characterization of the ultraluminous x - ray sources is also important .",
    "for example , if a mass estimate can be obtained via radial velocity measurements of a companion , this will shed new light on the nature of these objects . from the theoretical standpoint",
    "there are several important calculations .",
    "these include : ( 1 )  strong - gravity computations of the recoil speed of a black hole binary after merger , for different mass ratios and spins , ( 2 )  comprehensive numerical simulations of three - body interactions with high mass ratios , to represent intermediate - mass black holes , and ( 3 )  detailed numerical analysis of binary - binary encounters and the role of the kozai resonance , among others",
    ". whatever the results of this work , there will be significant new understanding gained on many fronts , including the information that can be obtained from analysis of the waveforms of the gravitational radiation produced by black hole mergers in dense clusters .",
