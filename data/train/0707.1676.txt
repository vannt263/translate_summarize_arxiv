    "recent years have seen a deep progress in our understading of the spectrum of maximally supersymmetric ads / cft in four dimensions , namely the scaling dimensions of the sym and the energies for string states of the type iib on @xmath3 in the planar limit . on both sides of the correspondence , the problem is basically solved in terms of thermodynamic bethe ansatz equations , which allow to compute the spectrum of long states ( i.e. the ones with a large @xmath10 r - charge @xmath11 ) for any value of the coupling @xmath12 .",
    "see for instance .",
    "the gauge theory problem is mapped to a spin chain computation . in the spin chain language ,",
    "one considers a finite set of impurities ( magnons ) propagating with a definite momentum @xmath13 along an infinite chain : integrability basically means that multimagnon scattering factorizes into @xmath14 scatterings and therefore we just need the magnons dispersion relation and the @xmath15-magnon @xmath16 matrix to compute the energy of an arbitrary state .",
    "remarkably , we know have an explicit expression for the @xmath16 matrix @xcite . the classical string theory dual of a magnon ( called giant magnon )",
    "was found in @xcite . in this giant magnon regime",
    "the energy @xmath17 and the spin @xmath18 are infinite with finite @xmath19 , like in the pp - wave limit @xcite , but the magnon momentum @xmath13 is finite and fixed , differently from the pp - wave limit where @xmath13 is infinitesimal , being @xmath20 with @xmath21 fixed",
    ".    a particular limit @xcite which interpolates between the pp - wave and the giant magnon regimes plays an important role . in this `` near - flat space '' limit , @xmath18 and @xmath12",
    "go to infinity while @xmath22{\\lambda}$ ] is kept finite .",
    "maldacena and swanson @xcite showed that the worldsheet sigma model drastically simplifies in the near - flat space limit , but the @xmath16 matrix remains non trivial ( differently from the pp - wave limit , where the magnons are free ) .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath16 matrix for the near - flat space sigma model of @xcite has been computed up to two loops @xcite and shown to agree with the near - flat space limit of the full @xmath16 matrix .",
    "our aim is to extend some of these important results to four dimensional ads / cft dualities with less symmetries .",
    "interesting generalizations of the maximal supersymmetric duality are based on type iib on backgrounds of the form @xmath0 , where the internal @xmath1 is a compact einstein manifold . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath1 is sasaki - einstein then minimal supersymmetry is preserved . in the seminal paper @xcite , the @xmath7 gauge theory dual to type iib on @xmath23 has been found .",
    "more recently , infinite families of five dimensional einstein - sasaki spaces have been found : @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "their gauge theory duals have been constructed respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "some of the results obtained in @xmath24 can be extended to these @xmath7 theories : for instance , in @xcite it has been shown that the classical string theory limit introduced in @xcite exists also for a generic sasaki - einstein manifold and can be qualitatively connected to a gauge theory spin chain .",
    "after @xcite , the penrose limit has been studied for the other compactifications of the form @xmath0 where the explicit metric is known , namely for the spaces @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath25 ( which are einstein but not sasaki ) @xcite , @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "when @xmath1 is a sasaki - einstein space , the resulting background is precisely the same one obtained for @xmath26 . for @xmath25",
    "the limiting background has always a pp - wave form , but some of global symmetries are broken .    in this paper",
    "we study the near - flat space limit for strings propagating on @xmath27 , taking manifolds like @xmath25 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 as internal five dimensional space @xmath1 .",
    "since the covariant action for the type iib superstring on @xmath27 is known only when @xmath28 @xcite , we consider only the bosonic sector , namely the polyakov action .",
    "our result is that for sasaki - einstein @xmath1 the near - flat space sigma model is identical to the one found for @xmath26 in @xcite .",
    "we show this explicitly for all the known sasaki - einstein metrics .",
    "since the sigma model of @xcite is integrable , this indicates that the four dimensional @xmath7 scft s with a ten dimensional gravity dual possess an integrable subsector .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ nfs for tpq ]",
    "we study the near - flat space limit for @xmath29 backgrounds , obtaining a two dimensional sigma model similar to the bosonic sector of the one found for @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the special case of @xmath4 , the only one which is stable ( in the sense of breitenlohner - freedman @xcite ) and supersymmetric , gives a limiting sigma model identical to the @xmath26 case . in section [ nfs ypq ]",
    "we consider the near - flat space limit for internal @xmath5 , recovering again the bosonic sector of the near - flat space sigma model of type iib on @xmath30 .",
    "since this situation resembles the one occurring for the penrose limit , where different geometries give the same limiting result , in section [ section u3 ] we introduce a generalized metric with @xmath2 symmetry and study its penrose limit ( subsection [ section penrose u3 ] ) and its near - flat space limit ( subsection [ section nfs u3 ] ) .",
    "the limiting sigma model is similar to the one found for @xmath3 , but the global symmetries are reduced in the most general case .",
    "moreover , we find that the coefficients characterizing the needed field redefinitions are the same occurring in the coordinate transformations of the penrose limit .",
    "in appendix [ s5 ] we review the initial steps of the near - flat space limit for @xmath30 @xcite , while in appendix [ appendix special cases ] we apply the considerations made in section [ section u3 ] to generalized metrics with @xmath2 symmetry which include the known cases in the usual coordinates more directly .",
    "we conclude by applying these results also to the special case of @xmath31 .",
    "in this section we construct the near - flat space limit of bosonic strings moving in backgrounds of the form @xmath32 , studying the polyakov action and the virasoro constraints . +",

    "the term @xmath69 in the lagrangian does not contribute to the action because it is a total derivative .",
    "instead , the term @xmath70 is proportional to @xmath71 this divergence of the action vanishes provided that @xmath72 these relations imply for @xmath73 @xmath74 for @xmath73 , which remains a free parameter . adopting ( [ kvaluestpq ] ) into ( [ field redefinitions tpq ] ) , we find @xmath75 where and @xmath76 for @xmath77 . as in @xcite ,",
    "the action is right conformal invariant ( @xmath78 with arbitrary @xmath79 ) , but it is not invariant under left conformal transformations ( @xmath80 ) .",

    "we thus find that , given ( [ kvaluestpq ] ) and the positive root of ( [ k_t tpq ] ) for the constants occurring in the field redefinitions , the polyakov action in the near - flat space limit is @xmath93 while the virasoro constraints @xmath94 and @xmath95 , to the first non trivial order , give rise to the two equations @xmath96 for generic @xmath13 and @xmath58 , the resulting two dimensional bosonic sigma models admit the symmetries @xmath97 , where the @xmath98 factor acts on the @xmath99 coordinates @xmath100 , while the two factors @xmath101 s act on @xmath102 and @xmath103 . + the symmetry is enhanced in the special case of @xmath104 , once the einstein condition is employed .",
