    "entanglement has been established as a crucial resource for quantum information tasks such as quantum communication and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "consequently , generating or enhancing entanglement between separate physical systems is of paramount importance in quantum information theory , and two cases are typically studied : ( i ) ancilla - assisted entanglement generation , and ( ii ) entanglement generation without assistance from ancillas .",
    "significant effort is currently directed to quantifying entanglement of states ; similarly it is important to quantify entanglement capabilities @xcite of unitary operations , or more generally , the `` strength '' @xcite of the operator .",
    "entangling power based on the linear entropy  @xcite is a valuable , and relatively easy to calculate , measure of the entanglement capability of an operator .",
    "we extend this definition to the ancilla - assisted case , and establish an equivalence between entangling power and an alternative quantity , `` operator entanglement '' @xcite , for arbitrary controlled unitary operations acting on two equal - dimensional qudits .    any gate that creates entanglement between qudits without ancillas acts as a universal gate for quantum computation when assisted by arbitrary one - qudit gates @xcite .",
    "therefore , the sum gate @xcite [ a generalization of the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate for qubits ] can be chosen as the basic , or primitive , two - qudit gate for qudit - based quantum computation .",
    "we study entangling power of the sum gate and other two - qudit gates , namely the double - sum ( dsum ) and swap gate to illustrate our results on more general gates as well as the general applicability of our approach",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : measures ] , we introduce the von neumann entropy and linear entropy as entanglement measures . in sec .",
    "[ sec : powers ] , we review the entangling power based on the linear entropy without ancillas , and extend to entangling power assisted by ancillas .",
    "we also give relations between the entangling power based on the von neumann entropy and the entangling power based on the linear entropy . in sec .",

    "we also provide an example of @xmath0 resulting from higher - order spin - spin interactions . in sec .",

    "various measures of entanglement exist , each with its own advantages and disadvantages @xcite .",
    "two commonly used entanglement measures for pure states are the von neumann entropy @xmath1 and the linear entropy @xmath2 . for a two - qudit pure state @xmath3 they are defined as @xmath4\\label{e1},\\\\ e(|\\psi \\rangle ) & : = \\text{tr}_1[\\rho_1(1-\\rho_1)]=1-\\text{tr}_1\\rho_1 ^2 , \\label{e2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the reduced density matrix . for convenience ,",

    "an operator can increase entanglement of a state , but an operator can also be considered to be entangled because operators themselves inhabit a hilbert space .",
