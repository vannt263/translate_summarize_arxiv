    "although more than half of a century has elapsed since landau proposed that the charge carrier could be trapped by the distortion of a crystal lattice,@xcite and pekar introduced the term polaron,@xcite a number of questions regarding the single - polaron theory remain unanswered .",
    "this is true even in the context of the holstein  hamiltonian,@xcite one of the simplest electron - lattice coupling models for the one - electron system .",
    "while the literature pertaining to the ground state of such a model is extensive , much less attention has been paid to the excited states , even at the low energies for which they are most interesting .    the nature of the excited polaron states has been investigated within the adiabatic approximation in refs .   by neglecting the polaron translation .",
    "these works provide a simple picture of the self - trapped polaron states for strong couplings .",
    "that is , the adiabatic softening of the phonon modes within the self - trapped polaron states results in several excitation energies below the bare phonon energy .",
    "it follows that the lowest excitations of the system are the polaron states for which the electron and the phonons are strongly correlated .",
    "when the polaron translation is restored , each of the soft - phonon modes below the bare phonon energy can be expected to develop the corresponding band if the local dynamics remain adiabatic .",
    "actually , moving polarons have been described within the adiabatic approximation by neglecting the force impeding the polaron translational motion due to the lattice discreteness.@xcite however , the band structure of the spectrum was not considered in these investigations . for strong couplings ,",
    "the bandwidth of the lowest band has been obtained by the adiabatic theory in the context of the simplest two - site model.@xcite    when considering the band structure it is important to realize that the polaron states are coherent in the range of energies below the phonon threshold ( i.e. , below the minimal energy for inelastic scattering).@xcite one way to investigate their properties is by analyzing the single - electron and optical conductivity spectra . in the case of the single - polaron problem ,",
    "the low - frequency coherent part of the spectral weight directly determines the polaron energies .",
    "most of the previous spectral investigations,@xcite however , make no mention of the excited coherent polaron bands .",
    "the exceptions in this respect are provided by those works employing the dynamic mean - field theory ( dmft ) , which is exact in the infinite dimension limit .",
    "the dmft results predict one excited polaron band below the phonon threshold.@xcite    for the one - dimensional system , recent exact - diagonalization ( ed ) and variational approaches@xcite obtained results for the lowest state of the first excited band .",
    "provided that the local electron dynamics remain adiabatic , and that the adiabatic calculation of the self - trapped polaron energies gives several solutions below the inelastic phonon threshold , more than one excited polaron band is expected to occur in this energy range .",
    "the present paper shows that the ed approaches for the infinite lattice , as implemented in recent works,@xcite can be extended to give very accurate results for the first few excited coherent polaron bands . in the range of parameters for which the method converges ,",
    "the coherent part of the spectrum is found to exhibit up to three excited polaron bands , two more than previously described .",
    "these results provide a better understanding of the spatial and temporal structure of the polaron states , as well as of their symmetry ( parity ) properties .",
    "the latter can be used to rationalize the contributions of the bands to the low - energy single - electron and optical conductivity spectra , respectively .",
    "an additional and attractive feature of the excitation spectrum obtained herein is its potential to help clarify the physical picture of the polaron crossover for moderate values of the adiabatic ratio .",
    "it has been previously proposed,@xcite in the context of the variational analysis,@xcite that this crossover , in which the ground state evolves from a light to a heavy polaron state , can be understood as the anticrossing ( hybridization ) of two low - energy states .",
    "this question is reconsidered here in terms of practically exact eigenstates and their aforementioned parity properties .",
    "specifically , the hybridization is found to occur between states of equal parity , whereas states of opposite parity cross without any such hybridization .",
    "furthermore , the hybridization of states in the crossover regime is characteristic not only of the holstein model under consideration . recently , for example , on the basis of accurate numerical results obtained by the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo method@xcite for the rashba - pekar polaron model,@xcite it has been suggested that the polaron crossover in that instance also involves a hybridization of several polaron solutions.@xcite    ed methods , analogous to the one employed here , have found widespread application in the ground - state calculations of numerous other many - body problems . in this context , the present analysis of the excited states , together with their symmetry attributes , is also of interest for the description of low - energy eigenstates and spectral properties from a more general point of view .",
    "the one - dimensional holstein  model of interest here is defined by the hamiltonian    @xmath0    @xmath1 is nearest - neighbor hopping energy of the electron , @xmath2 is the energy of dispersionless optical phonons , while @xmath3 is the electron - phonon coupling energy . @xmath4 and @xmath5 are creation operators for the electron and phonon at lattice site @xmath6 , respectively . as only the single - electron problem",
    "is treated , the spin indices have been omitted .    the total momentum of the system ( @xmath7 ) is the sum of electron and phonon momenta . as @xmath7 commutes with the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) , the complete set of states of the system can be constructed from eigenstates of @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) is also invariant under space inversion .",
    "however , the analysis of the resulting parity properties of the eigenstates will be deferred until later in the present discussion [ sec . [ s10d ] ] .",
    "the eigenstates that will be considered herein are those falling in the energy window defined by    @xmath10    @xmath11 is the minimal energy of the system ( the zero - momentum polaron ground - state energy ) and @xmath2 is the energy of the bare phonon excitation",
    ". when the electron - phonon coupling is absent ( @xmath12 ) the states below the phonon threshold @xmath13 are those of the free electron band .",
    "when @xmath3 is switched on , the free electron states evolve into those states correlated with phonons .",
    "furthermore , additional bands can appear below @xmath13 as the coupling increases .",
    "all states in the energy window ( [ ec ] ) are correlated and will be referred to as polaron states . for @xmath14 the electron and the additional phonons can form weakly - bound states , which results in a highly degenerate spectrum .    the energies of the coherent polaron states are henceforth denoted by @xmath15 , and the wave functions by @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath17 is the momentum of the polaron state ( which is also the system momentum ) , while @xmath18 denotes the band index .",
    "the lowest ( ground ) polaron band will be denoted by @xmath19 . in the present paper",
    "the term ground state is used for the state of minimal energy for a given momentum @xmath17 , and not to the @xmath20 state only .",
    "accordingly , the first excited state corresponds to the first excited state of a given momentum @xmath17 , and so forth .    for the polaron bands below the phonon threshold",
    "@xmath13 the states @xmath16 are the eigenstates of @xmath21,@xcite    @xmath22    more generally , it can be shown that for all eigenstates @xmath23 the simple sum - rule for the mean total lattice deformation , given by    @xmath24    is satisfied . in eq .",
    "( [ xtot ] ) @xmath25 is the space uncertainty of the free harmonic oscillator with frequency @xmath26 . besides its physical meaning",
    ", the sum - rule for the mean total lattice deformation can also be used as a tool for checking the validity of results obtained with approximate polaron wave functions .",
    "in the case of the holstein  polaron problem , the ed approach uses only a finite number of states which contribute significantly to the exact polaron wave function for a given set of hamiltonian  parameters . by using the hamiltonian  matrix corresponding to the truncated ( reduced ) basis , and the appropriate numerical scheme ,",
    "one calculates the polaron wave functions and energies .",
    "the convergence of the results can be verified by increasing the number of basis states in the calculation . in most cases",
    "the results are very accurate , provided that the truncation procedure is well chosen .    the ed method developed in the current paper",
    "is henceforth referred to as the exact translational method ( @xmath27 method ) .",
    "the basis states of the @xmath27 method are given by@xcite    @xmath28    the orthonormal wave function ( [ tstate ] ) describes an electron which is surrounded by a cloud of phonons .",
    "the number of phonons at the @xmath29th lattice site away from the electron is given by @xmath30 , while @xmath17 corresponds to the total system momentum and @xmath31 is the lattice constant .",
    "the basis states ( [ tstate ] ) of different momenta @xmath17 are not mixed by the holstein  hamiltonian .",
    "if the adiabatic ratio @xmath32 is not too large , the @xmath27 method can be used for studying polarons in the weak- and the strong - coupling regime , as well as in the crossover regime between them .",
    "the present paper is focused , particularly , on the regime in which @xmath33 and @xmath3 is arbitrary . for @xmath34 ,",
    "the number of relevant basis states ( [ tstate ] ) becomes large and the problem of finding the polaron wave functions becomes untreatable .",
    "unfortunately , the limit @xmath34 which is not considered here , is difficult for other known numerical methods as well .",
    "the matrix representation of the holstein  hamiltonian  in the @xmath27 basis leads to a sparse matrix . that is , it is straightforward to show that , by acting on the state ( [ tstate ] ) with the hamiltonian  ( [ ham ] ) , the maximum number of non - zero matrix elements per @xmath27 basis state is five .",
    "as an example , let us form the reduced hilbert  space of only five @xmath27 states , i.e. , of the zero - phonon state @xmath35 , of three states with one phonon ( phonon at the electron site , at the left site from the electron , and at the right site from the electron ) ,    @xmath36    and finally , of the state with two phonons at the electron site @xmath37 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian  matrix is given by    @xmath38\\;.\\ ] ]    in the limit @xmath39 the @xmath27 method gives a good polaron ground state with only these five states .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath40 one usually has to work with a truncated basis of quite large dimension .",
    "in other words , the @xmath27 method generally requires a numerical scheme capable of dealing with large sparse matrices .    for this purpose",
    "the well - known lanczos algorithm appears to be the most appropriate choice.@xcite indeed , the previous papers using the @xmath27 method for ground - state calculations have employed this technique .",
    "an additional , attractive , feature of the lanczos algorithm is that it is capable of finding not just one , but rather a few extreme eigenvalues ( and eigenvectors ) of sparse matrices , provided they are well separated ( lying in the discrete part of the spectrum ) .",
    "accordingly , the current results have been obtained by the lanczos procedure with the so - called local orthogonalization .",
    "in addition , the states have been calculated by the block - lanczos procedure , with both variants giving the same results .",
    "it should be stressed that the present results are compared to the already cited ground - state results@xcite of the @xmath27 method .",
    "all states are checked through the sum - rule ( [ xtot ] ) , as well as through their mutual orthogonality .",
    "at the beginning of our discussion it is instructive to observe how the polaron bands are formed in regard to the strength of the electron - phonon coupling @xmath3 . for this purpose ,",
    "the polaron bands are plotted in the four panels of fig.[fig1 ] as functions of the momentum ( @xmath17 ) , for @xmath41 and different values of @xmath3 . as in the remainder of the paper",
    ", @xmath42 is used as the energy unit . notice that , as discussed in connection with eq .",
    "( [ ec ] ) , only the part of the spectrum below the phonon threshold ( between @xmath43 and @xmath13 ) is shown .    in the weak - coupling limit for the lowest band ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "two regimes exist with respect to the critical momentum @xmath44.@xcite for @xmath45 the polaron state of energy @xmath46 is the ground state of the system .",
    "for @xmath47 the ground state consists of the polaron and the unbound phonon excitation .",
    "the unbound phonon excitation carries the system momentum @xmath17 , while the polaron momentum is equal to @xmath48 . for @xmath47",
    "the ground - state energy lies at the bottom of the incoherent part of the spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "the first panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the @xmath27 weak - coupling results .",
    "notice that the top flat part of the lowest band for @xmath47 has been cut by the frame .",
    "the reason is that the numerical error of the corresponding @xmath27 states is slightly greater than that of the zero - momentum ground state , while the energy interval shown is exactly equal to the bare phonon energy @xmath2 .",
    "as the electron - phonon coupling increases , the lowest band becomes more renormalized , and finally , at some critical coupling , the whole band falls bellow @xmath13 .    by increasing electron - phonon coupling further ,",
    "the additional polaron bands emerge below @xmath13 . in the second and the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the results for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are shown , respectively .",
    "these are the choices of parameters that correspond to the crossover regime . for @xmath49 ,",
    "only a part of the first excited band ( @xmath51 ) lies below @xmath13 , whereas for @xmath50 there are four polaron bands in the relevant energy window . from the third panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( @xmath50 ) one sees that the top of the second excited band ( @xmath52 ) is at @xmath20 , and the bottom is at @xmath53 .",
    "in addition , this band ( @xmath52 ) crosses the other excited bands ( @xmath54 ) , i.e. , the first excited band near the end of the brillouin  zone ( for @xmath55 ) , and the third excited band near the center of the brillouin  zone .    for strong couplings ( @xmath56 )",
    "the @xmath27 results are shown in the last panel of fig .",
    "all the bands are very narrow .",
    "although it is hard to distinguish the third excited band ( @xmath57 ) from the plot - frame , note that @xmath58 for all @xmath17 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] gives further insight into the polaron band formation .",
    "here , the @xmath20 and @xmath53 energy curves , shifted by @xmath43 , are plotted for four bands ( @xmath18 is the band index ) .",
    "the results are presented for the crossover and the strong - coupling regimes . in the weak - coupling regime (",
    "not shown on fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) @xmath59 becomes smaller than @xmath13 for @xmath60 .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that the bandwidth of the lowest band decreases continuously with @xmath3 .",
    "on the other hand , the bandwidth of the first excited state shows a more complicated behavior .",
    "namely , for @xmath61 this bandwidth is maximal , while , unlike for the lowest band , it decreases for smaller values of @xmath3 .",
    "its maximal value and the minimum of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) correspond to similar electron - phonon couplings . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the band crossing which involves the second and the two other excited bands can be clearly seen to occur in the crossover regime .",
    "that fact that these bands cross each other indicates that they belong to different symmetries , as will be discussed further below [ sec .",
    "[ s10d ] ] .    in strong - coupling regime",
    "the spectrum consists of very narrow bands .",
    "although in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] the bands are well separated , for very large couplings all of the excited bands approach @xmath13 from below .",
    "finally , it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that , for @xmath41 , the energy of the third excited band stays close to @xmath13 both in the crossover and the strong - coupling regimes .",
    "the @xmath17 values corresponding to the top of the third excited band depend sensitively on the hamiltonian  parameters .",
    "it should therefore be kept in mind that , in contrast to the other bands , the @xmath53 curve only approximately determines the boundary of this band . in particular , the third excited band is slightly wider than suggested by fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in the crossover regime .      in order to understand the physical background of the bands shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , the strong - coupling and the crossover regime are examined separately in the following sections . in the strong coupling regime",
    "the time scale relevant to the polaron translation is much slower than the time scale ( @xmath64 ) involved in the local polaron dynamics .",
    "therefore , the local interplay between the electron density and the lattice deformation is almost independent of the polaron momentum . from the energy point of view",
    "the contributions corresponding to the polaron translation can be neglected , and the polarons can be treated , to a good approximation , as self - trapped . the deep potential well of the lattice deformation of the self - trapped polaron captures the electron . when the electron is light ( @xmath65 ) , it is able to follow the slow motion of the lattice deformation ( e.g. , zero - point motion ) , which results in the adiabatic renormalization of the phonon modes within the lattice deformation .",
    "the physical picture of the aforementioned self - trapped polaron follows from the adiabatic theory , and can be considered to be well understood .",
    "thus , in order to achieve a better understanding of the current numerical results , it is convenient to compare the renormalized phonon energies obtained in the adiabatic limit to the spectrum calculated by the @xmath27 method . for the holsteinpolaron problem",
    "the renormalized phonon modes have been calculated by different adiabatic approximations.@xcite the procedure of ref .",

    "iii ) treats the lattice discreteness directly , while the polaron translation is neglected .",
    "this approximation is appropriate for the present case as the lattice discreteness is important for the small self - trapped polarons , while the polaron translation has only a minor contribution to the energy .",
    "the three short - dashed curves in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] are the renormalized phonon energies of ref .  .",
    "the lowest excitation is a symmetric vibration of the lattice with respect to the polaron center ( breathing mode ) .",
    "the next excitation is the antisymmetric vibration ( pinning mode ) .",
    "the third excited mode is again a symmetric vibration , although extended over a larger number of lattice sites than in the case of the lowest excitation . in fig.[fig3 ] , the solid curves are the @xmath27 energies of the @xmath20 polaron excited states . in the strong coupling limit [ the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ] the results of ref .",
    "are recovered asymptotically , from below . the inset of fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , where only a small part of the spectrum below @xmath13 is shown , clearly demonstrates this behavior . for strong couplings ,",
    "the positions of the excited bands are given by the the symmetric and antisymmetric phonon excitations of the adiabatic theory .",
    "in other words , the local dynamics of the self - trapped polarons is adiabatic .",
    "the energy @xmath66 is plotted as the long - dashed curve in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "this curve defines the bandwidth of the lowest polaron band which can be seen to become large in the crossover regime [ the left part of fig.[fig3 ] ] , as the translation of the polaron becomes important . on the other hand , in the strong coupling limit",

    "[ fig4 ] the bandwidths , as functions of @xmath3 , are compared for constant @xmath69 .",
    "the solid curves are the results for the three lowest polaron bands .",
    "one sees that the effective hopping @xmath68 is increased if the polaron ( i.e. , the local lattice deformation ) is excited .",
    "however , for strong couplings all bands are very narrow ( @xmath70 ) , meaning that the polarons are very heavy ( self - trapped ) . in real solids the coherent transport of such band states can be destroyed by the polaron - polaron interaction or by imperfections.@xcite    a close inspection of the @xmath27 results in fig .",

    "[ fig4 ] ] , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ tpol ] ) that the translational dynamics of the lowest band are essentially nonadiabatic , with adiabatic corrections .",

    "the adiabatic softening of the local phonon modes determines the positions of the ground and excited bands in the spectrum .",
    "the energy shift due to the softening is much larger than the bandwidths , which means that the polaron hopping can be neglected for the local dynamics .      in spite of the fact that the almost exact results for the lowest polaron band in the crossover regime , obtained by various numerical methods , have been known for quite some time",
    ", the corresponding qualitative explanation of the polaron properties does not appear completely satisfactory .",
    "it has been suggested in ref .",
    ", by the use of global - local method,@xcite that a simple empirical relation between hamiltonian  parameters    @xmath79    describes the regime for which the fast change from light to heavy polaron ground state takes place .",
    "indeed , @xmath80 predicts , to a good approximation , the set of parameters for which the variation of the polaron effective mass ( as a function of @xmath3 ) is the fastest .",
    "for @xmath81 the crossover occurs in the adiabatic regime when @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "approaching @xmath84 from the strong - coupling adiabatic side ( @xmath85 ) , the size of the polaron increases .",
    "consequently , the peierls - nabarro ( pn ) barrier decreases and the tunneling of the adiabatic polaron to the neighboring sites becomes possible .",
    "this effect is also responsible for the coupling of the pinning and the breathing lattice modes.@xcite at @xmath86 , the restoring force of the pinning mode due to the pn barrier can be neglected , and one may treat the polaron as a freely moving.@xcite such a scenario thus describes the crossover from the self - trapped ( heavy ) to propagating ( light ) polaron states in the adiabatic limit .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath87 , the nonadiabatic theory describes the polaron translation for arbitrary @xmath3 , and in particular , at @xmath88 of eq.([gst ] ) . in this case",
    ", the polaron crossover appears essentially as a passage from the weak- to the strong - coupling ground state .    a reinspection of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that the two well - separated time scales found in the strong - coupling regime , one related to the polaron translation ( given by the bandwidth ) , and the other related to the polaron local dynamics ( given by the renormalized phonon energies ) , become comparable in the crossover regime .",

    "the influence of the polaron hopping to the neighboring sites on the renormalized modes can not be neglected under these conditions , as it can for strong couplings .",

    "this difference , however , is not necessarily related to nonadiabatic effects , as for the moderate values of the adiabatic ratio under current consideration ( @xmath90 ) it is not clear to what extent the nonadiabatic dynamics enter into the description of the polaron translation .      irrespective of their temporal ( or spatial ) properties , when the polaron bands cross and/or anticross as in fig .",

    "the polaron effective mass @xmath113 can be evaluated numerically by using the relation@xcite    @xmath114    where @xmath115 is a small finite deviation of the momentum from the value @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath116 is the effective mass of the electron , and @xmath18 denotes the band number .",
    "the ground- ( @xmath117 ) and the first excited - state ( @xmath118 ) effective masses are compared for @xmath119 in fig .",
    "although @xmath120 for @xmath121 , @xmath118 becomes smaller than @xmath117 as @xmath3 decreases . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the results are qualitatively the same [ e.g. , see fig .  [ fig9 ] ] , which means that the anticrossing picture indeed matches the behavior of @xmath117 and @xmath118 near @xmath80 .    for fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "the mean total lattice deformation ( [ xtot ] ) is the same for the ground and for the excited states .",
    "however , the local phonon cloud around the electron can be more or less localized , which affects the polaron hopping to the neighboring sites .",
    "a light state implies that the associated local lattice deformation is spread to a larger number of lattice sites than for the heavy state .",
    "namely , such a deformation gives rise to a greater effective hopping integral .",
    "the mean number of phonons in the polaron state is given by    @xmath122    in the adiabatic limit , this number is quadratic in the local lattice deformation for the ground state .",
    "a more localized ( heavier ) lattice deformation leads to larger @xmath123 . within the adiabatic approximation",
    "the excited renormalized phonon should , in general , increase the mean number of phonons with respect to @xmath123 .",
    "particularly , in the strong - coupling limit one obtains    @xmath124    as the renormalization of the lattice vibrations becomes negligible .    from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , in which @xmath125 is plotted as a function of @xmath3 , one sees that the @xmath27 results tend to eq.([np1 ] ) for strong couplings . in the crossover regime ,",
    "on the other hand , @xmath125 deviates from eq .",
    "( [ np1 ] ) considerably .",
    "@xmath126 is greater than @xmath127 for @xmath110 and smaller than @xmath127 for @xmath111 . for larger @xmath1 ,",
    "the amplitude of the deviation increases even further . as shown in in the inset of fig.[fig7 ] , @xmath128 for @xmath129 , while the minimal and maximal values of @xmath125 define an interval of almost 5 phonons .",
    "additional insights into the local polaron properties can be provided by studying the appropriate electron - lattice correlation function ,    @xmath130    @xmath131 is the mean lattice deformation induced at the @xmath6th site away from the electron .",
    "the correlation function ( [ xn ] ) is normalized in such a way that @xmath132 . as the correlation spreads to adjacent lattice sites , the correlation at the electron site @xmath133 decreases .",
    "consequently , @xmath133 should be larger for the heavy than for the light polaron state .",
    "the ground- and first excited - state results for @xmath134 are plotted in fig .",
    "the relationship between @xmath135 and @xmath136 changes near @xmath80 .",
    "this is exactly what one would expect from the anticrossing picture .",
    "@xmath137 for @xmath110 . as",
    "the contribution of the heavy state to the ground state becomes dominant for @xmath111 , the relationship changes , and @xmath138 .",
    "the spreading of the lattice deformation as a function of @xmath3 may also be deduced from @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "the results corresponding to this lattice site , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , again lead one to the same conclusion . for @xmath110 the lattice deformation seems to spread more for the ground than for the excited state , and vice - versa for @xmath111 .",
    "all of the aforementioned ground- and first excited - state properties ( the energy , the effective mass , the mean number of phonons , and the electron - lattice deformation correlation function ) indicate that for @xmath141 the anticrossing of two ( light and heavy ) polaron states occurs near @xmath80 .",
    "although criteria such as @xmath142 being minimal , @xmath143 , @xmath144 , or alternative criteria , do not agree exactly , they all predict the polaron crossover to occur within the same very narrow parameter range , given approximately by eq .",
    "( [ gst ] ) .",
    "denoting the vacuum state by @xmath145 , the zero - temperature single - electron green function can be expressed as@xcite    @xmath146    for the energies below the phonon threshold @xmath147 no polaron - phonon scattering takes place , which has the consequence that the imaginary part of the electron self - energy @xmath148 tends to zero.@xcite accordingly , the low - energy part of the spectral function @xmath149 , denoted by @xmath150 , is defined by the simple poles of @xmath151 at @xmath152 ,    @xmath153    i.e. , the spectral function @xmath150 is defined by the polaron energy @xmath154 and the quasiparticle weight @xmath155 . in particular , for @xmath20 and @xmath53 , the quasiparticle weight @xmath156 vanishes by parity for the @xmath103 eigenstates @xmath107 , because the free electron ( zero - phonon ) state @xmath157 belongs to the @xmath108 subspace of eq .",

    "moreover , @xmath160 defined by    @xmath161    reveals that , in the crossover regime ( for @xmath110 ) , nearly 40 percent of the total spectral weight confined to the ground and excited polaron states can be located in the energy window below the phonon threshold .",
    "therefore , at least for @xmath162 and for the values of adiabatic ratio under current considerations ( @xmath141 ) , the results imply the existence of a few well - pronounced peaks in the single - electron spectral density below the phonon threshold . for stronger couplings , on the other hand ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight below the phonon threshold is almost completely suppressed .      when the electron propagator @xmath151 is expressed in terms of the electron self - energy @xmath163 , both @xmath164 and @xmath154 of eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) can be related to @xmath163 .",

    "when the self - energy @xmath163 is local ( @xmath17-independent , @xmath169 ) the polaron effective mass is related solely to the quasiparticle weight @xmath170 .",
    "thus , the non - local character of the self - energy can be investigated by comparing @xmath168 to unity.@xcite such analysis is particularly interesting in the context of dmft , as the locality ( implying @xmath169 ) of the self - energy is an essential ingredient of this approach.@xcite in both , the weak - coupling ( @xmath171 ) and nonadiabatic ( @xmath172 ) limits , @xmath163 becomes local.@xcite within the holstein - lang - firsov approximation@xcite and for @xmath172 , the self - energy @xmath173 is , to a good approximation , given by its expansion to the first order in @xmath159 over the whole energy range defined by the lowest band . in this case",

    "( [ meff ] ) ] .",
    "the @xmath27 results agree with the aforementioned analytical findings for small @xmath1 and/or @xmath3.@xcite it follows that significant non - local contributions to @xmath163 can possibly occur in the regime where neither @xmath1 nor @xmath3 are small . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] @xmath170 is plotted for moderate @xmath1 as function of @xmath3 , while the right panel shows @xmath168 for the same set of parameters .",
    "although @xmath168 does not contribute to @xmath113 substantially for @xmath110 , at stronger couplings @xmath168 reaches values of the order of unity for both the ground and the first excited state .",
    "that is , the non - local contribution to the electron self - energy is as equally important as the local one .",
    "however , it should be noticed that , in this regime , the quasiparticle weight @xmath175 becomes small .",
    "the interband optical conductivity may be evaluated within the linear - response theory from the current - current correlation function .",
    "the low - energy ( coherent ) contribution to the real part of the interband conductivity at zero temperature is given by@xcite    @xmath176    where @xmath177 are the @xmath20 polaron states , herein calculated by the @xmath27 method .",
    "the incoherent contribution to the interband conductivity , denoted by @xmath178 , corresponds to the continuum of the excitation spectrum above the phonon threshold . since the current operator in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) , defined by    @xmath179    is odd under the space inversion , the nonvanishing matrix elements in eq .",
    "( [ sk ] ) are those between the @xmath104 ground state @xmath180 and @xmath103 excited states @xmath177 .",
    "actually , the incoherent part of the interband optical conductivity @xmath178 involves only @xmath103 excitations as well . on the contrary , as argued in eq .",
    "( [ ak ] ) , the spectral function @xmath149 contains information about the @xmath104 part of the spectrum at @xmath181 .",
    "the optical conductivity at zero temperature is therefore described by those excited states for which the quasiparticle weight @xmath182 vanishes , i.e. , those states that are not seen in the single - electron spectral function .",
    "the real part of the optical conductivity @xmath183 includes the interband part and the ( intraband ) drude term at @xmath184 .",
    "it follows from the well - known sum - rule@xcite that the total spectral weight of @xmath183 is given by the mean value of the electron kinetic energy in the ground state .",
    "consequently , not only is the @xmath27 method capable of calculating @xmath185 , but the total spectral weight of @xmath183 is also accessible .",
    "furthermore , one may estimate the weight of the drude term from the polaron effective mass.@xcite    according to the @xmath27 results , for @xmath186 there is only one interband transition @xmath187 which contributes at zero temperature to @xmath185 [ eq . ( [ sk ] ) ] .",
    "it is interesting to find the corresponding non - drude spectral weight below the phonon threshold .",
    "however , @xmath188 is less than @xmath13 for relatively strong couplings , for which most of the spectral weight of @xmath183 belongs to high energies . in this parameter regime",
    "only a few percent ( or less ) of the total spectral weight of @xmath183 corresponds to @xmath185 , or to the drude term .",
    "this simple low - energy picture of @xmath183 becomes certainly more complex at finite temperature , particularly in the crossover regime where the bandwidths of the coherent polaron states increase .",
    "studies at finite temperature , however , require different methods than the one presented here .",
    "this paper reports an exact - diagonalization study of the ground and excited polaron states in the one - dimensional holstein  model . for values of the adiabatic ratio @xmath141 ,",
    "accurate energies and wave functions are obtained for translationally invariant solutions of the infinite lattice problem .",
    "the chosen method is restricted to the part of the spectrum below the phonon threshold , for which there are no phonon excitations uncorrelated to the polaron .",
    "the eigenstates of the holstein  hamiltonian  can be distinguished according to their parity .",
    "this property follows form the hamiltonian  which is invariant under the space inversion .",
    "it is shown that only the odd excited states of the system are relevant to the optical conductivity at zero temperature . however , the contribution of the coherent excited polaron state is rather small with respect to the total spectral weight . on the other hand ,",
    "it is the even states that contribute to the single - electron spectral function for @xmath181 . in this case",
    ", the contribution of the coherent excited polaron states is found to be important , particularly in the crossover regime .    in the strong - coupling regime",
    "the results agree with the picture of self - trapped polarons , which may be regarded as well understood .",
    "the spectrum is characterized by very small polaron bandwidths .",
    "consequently , the time scale associated with the polaron translation is very large , and the contributions to the fast local polaron dynamics from the polaron hopping are negligible . by making a comparison with the @xmath27 results",
    ", it is shown that the adiabatic theory ( the born - oppenheimer approximation ) provides a good description of the local properties of the self - trapped polaron .",
    "namely , the energies of the renormalized phonon excitations are close to the @xmath27 excited - band energies",
    ". two of the excited bands correspond to the symmetric adiabatic vibrations of the lattice , while one corresponds to the antisymmetric ( pinning ) vibration .",
    "finally , it is found that for strong couplings the electron self - energy shows significant non - local ( @xmath17-dependent ) behavior at moderate @xmath1 .",
    "as the electron - phonon coupling decreases at moderate @xmath1 , the simple band structure found in the strong - coupling regime ( i.e. , the narrow and well separated polaron bands ) evolves notably .",
    "the effective hopping integral of the ground and excited polaron states defines a time scale which , in the crossover regime , is comparable to the time scale relevant for the local polaron dynamics . in the crossover regime",
    "the excited ( odd - parity ) band which corresponds to the pinning vibration in the strong - coupling regime , crosses the other two ( even - parity ) bands which correspond to symmetric vibrations .",
    "the results suggest that the same critical set of parameters defined by @xmath80 [ eq .  ( [ gst ] ) ] , found for the polaron ground - state crossover , may also be associated with the rapid change of the low - energy excitation spectrum .    aside from the fact that the polaron translation and the local dynamics mix in the crossover regime , the intermediate ( moderate ) values of the adiabatic ratio employed herein present additional difficulties for qualitative understanding .",
    "namely , for @xmath33 , both the adiabatic and the nonadiabatic contributions could be important for the polaron crossover . nevertheless , in the context of the @xmath27 approach , the analyses of the energy , the effective mass , and the lattice deformation properties , all agree in one important respect . that is , for moderate values of the adiabatic ratio , two polaron states of even parity ( one heavy and one light ) undergo an anticrossing in the same region of parameters for which the ground state crosses over from the weak- to the strong - coupling regime .",
