    "<S> we have achieved mobilities in excess of 200,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 at electron densities of @xmath22@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 by suspending single layer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> suspension @xmath2150 nm above a si / sio@xmath6 gate electrode and electrical contacts to the graphene was achieved by a combination of electron beam lithography and etching . </S>",
    "<S> the specimens were cleaned in situ by employing current - induced heating , directly resulting in a significant improvement of electrical transport . </S>",
    "<S> concomitant with large mobility enhancement , the widths of the characteristic dirac peaks are reduced by a factor of 10 compared to traditional , non - suspended devices . </S>",
    "<S> this advance should allow for accessing the intrinsic transport properties of graphene .    </S>",
    "<S> graphene , the latest addition to the family of two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials , is distinguished from its cousins by its unusual band structure , rendering the quasiparticles in it formally identical to massless , chiral fermions . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental realization of graphene thus presents tantalizing opportunities to study phenomena ranging from the topological phase resulting in exotic quantum hall states @xcite to the famous klein paradox  the anomalous tunneling of relativistic particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite tremendous interest and concerted experimental efforts [ 1 - 23 ] , the presence of strong impurity scattering  which limits the electron mean free path to less than a micron  has been a major barrier to progress . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , there is strong evidence that graphene is a nearly perfect crystal free of the structural defects @xcite that characterize most conductors . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , it has been put forth that the scattering of charge carriers stems from extrinsic sources @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the exact nature of the scattering that limits the mobility of graphene devices remains unclear , evidence has mounted that interactions with the underlying substrate are largely responsible . </S>",
    "<S> surface charge traps @xcite , interfacial phonons @xcite , substrate stabilized ripples @xcite , and fabrication residues on or under the graphene sheet may all contribute . consequently </S>",
    "<S> , improving substrate quality or eliminating the substrate altogether by suspending graphene over a trench seems a promising strategy towards higher quality samples . </S>",
    "<S> while devices suspended over the substrate were achieved in the past @xcite , they lacked multiple electrical contacts thus precluding transport measurements .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we report the fabrication of electrically contacted suspended graphene and achieve a tenfold improvement in mobility as compared to the best values reported in the literature for traditional devices fabricated on a substrate . </S>",
    "<S> besides opening new avenues for studying the intrinsic physics of dirac fermions , this improvement demonstrates the dominant role played by extrinsic scattering in limiting the transport properties of unsuspended graphene samples .    </S>",
    "<S> the fabrication of a suspended graphene device starts with optically locating a single - layer mechanically exfoliated graphene flake on top of a silicon substrate covered with 300 nm of sio@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> single - layer graphene flakes are identified based on their contrast @xcite , and later confirmed via measurements of the half - integer quantum hall effect @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we avoid patterning the flakes using oxygen plasma etching @xcite , as it may introduce additional defects in the bulk and dangling bonds at the edges of graphene . instead , we choose natural flakes of approximately rectangular shape suitable for fabrication into hall bars . </S>",
    "<S> electron beam lithography is employed to pattern the contacts to the flake . the contact material ( 3 nm cr followed by 100 nm of au ) </S>",
    "<S> is deposited by thermal evaporation followed by a liftoff in warm acetone . the large size and thickness of the electrodes </S>",
    "<S> enhances the mechanical rigidity of the device . </S>",
    "<S> suspension of the graphene flake is achieved by dipping the entire device into 1:6 buffered oxide etch ( boe ) for 90 seconds , which uniformly removes approximately 150 nm of sio@xmath6 across the substrate , _ including the area below the flake _ </S>",
    "<S> ( sio@xmath6 masked by the gold electrodes remains unetched ) . </S>",
    "<S> uniform etching of the substrate directly below the flake is crucial for our process as it allows the fabrication of large - area suspended graphene , while maintaining the parallel plate capacitor geometry for our device . to our knowledge , this unexpected etching anisotropy in the presence of graphene was not reported before ; it is , however , consistent with the rapid propagation of boe along the sio@xmath6/graphene interface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the device is transferred from boe to ethanol and dried in a critical - point - drying step to avoid the surface - tension - induced collapse of the suspended graphene sheet .     with respect to the sample plane . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) afm image of the suspended device # 1 before the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) afm image of the device # 1 after the measurements with graphene removed by a short oxygen plasma etch ( same z scale ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( d ) device schematic , side - view . </S>",

    "<S> the graphene is apparent as a thin sheet suspended above the surface of the remaining sio@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the sheet is supported by six gold electrodes attached to sio@xmath6 , which have been slightly undercut during the boe etching step ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) . </S>",
    "<S> atomic force microscopy ( afm ) ( figs . 1b , c ) demonstrates convincingly the integrity of the graphene sheet , its suspension above the oxide and the flatness of the substrate below it . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1b clearly indicates a flat graphene surface @xmath2150 nm above the surface of sio@xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the single layer of carbon atoms , which makes up graphene , is remarkably robust and is not damaged by repeated afm imaging . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1c show the same device after completion of the electrical measurement and after removal of the suspended graphene via an oxygen plasma etch @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it reveals the previously hidden sio@xmath6 substrate below the graphene . </S>",
    "<S> the height variation of the substrate is less than 20 nm , with a slight bowing towards the center of the device . </S>",
    "<S> we thus conclude that our fabrication process results in graphene devices suspended @xmath2150 nm above sio@xmath6 substrate ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1d ) .    </S>",
    "<S> electrical measurements on suspended graphene devices are performed in a sample - in - vacuum cryostat with a pressure of less than @xmath8 mtorr . </S>",
    "<S> a total of one four - probe and two six - probe devices were measured . before cooling the cryostat to its base temperature of @xmath25 k </S>",
    "<S> the devices are thermally annealed in situ to 400 k , as this has been shown to reduce spurious doping in unsuspended samples @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> four - probe measurements are performed using standard low - frequency lock - in techniques with the excitation current less than @xmath9  na . </S>",
    "<S> a typical measurement consists of sending the current between electrodes labeled 1 and 4 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1a and recording the voltages @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) between electrodes 2 and 3 ( 2 and 6 ) respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the resistance is calculated as @xmath12 and the hall resistance as @xmath13 . to convert resistance to resistivity we estimate the ratio of sample width to spacing between voltage probes from images such as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . following the general approach for extended voltage probes we use the center - to - center distance along the current path ( @xmath14 ) as the sample length and the distance between voltage probes perpendicular to the current path as the sample width ( @xmath15 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sheet resistivity @xmath16 is then calculated as @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> the uncertainty in actual current and voltage distribution within our specimens may place an error on the estimated value of @xmath16 of less than 30% .    </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity is measured as a function of gate voltage @xmath18 applied between graphene and the degenerately doped silicon substrate . </S>",
    "<S> special care is taken not to collapse the devices electrostatically , as applying gate voltage @xmath18 of either sign leads to an attractive force between the flexible suspended graphene @xcite and the gate . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of graphene collapse at @xmath19 v in similar samples leads us to limit the range of applied gate voltages to @xmath20 v throughout our experiments . following bunch _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we estimate the force acting on our typical device # 1 at @xmath21 v as @xmath22  n , where @xmath23 nm are thicknesses of the remaining and etched sio@xmath6 and @xmath24 @xmath25 m are the length and the width of the device . using simple mechanics , we estimate the maximum strain @xmath26 in graphene to be in the range @xmath21  v as @xmath27 , assuming a young modulus @xmath28=1 tpa and a thickness @xmath290.34  nm @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we deduce that this strain level does not significantly affect electronic transport in graphene .    the blue line of fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a shows the low temperature resistivity @xmath16 of sample # 1 , measured as a function of the gate voltage @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe the dirac peak , indicated by a maximum in the resistivity , at the gate voltage v@xmath30 close to zero . </S>",
    "<S> the small reproducible fluctuations in @xmath31 are consistent with universal conductance fluctuation , typically seen in mesoscopic devices @xcite . the carrier density @xmath32 is determined via hall effect measurements as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the applied magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the gate capacitance of the device is calculated as @xmath35 af@xmath25m@xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the measured capacitance is close to the value @xmath37 </S>",
    "<S> 47@xmath385 af@xmath25m@xmath36 expected for graphene suspended 150@xmath3820 nm above 150@xmath3820 nm of residual sio@xmath6 , as calculated using the serial capacitor model . </S>",
    "<S> this provides an independent verification that the device is suspended during the measurements . </S>",
    "<S> finally , using the above carrier density , we determine the electron mobility @xmath39 28,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 at @xmath40 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this is comparable to the best reported values for unsuspended devices at the same density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , despite removing the substrate , at this stage the scattering in graphene is not significantly reduced , which leads us to the conclusion that it is caused by residual impurities absorbed on the graphene surface .    </S>",
    "<S> further mobility enhancement requires removal of the remaining impurities . </S>",
    "<S> this is accomplished by sending a large current through the device . </S>",
    "<S> for unsuspended samples , this current annealing was demonstrated to heat the graphene sheet locally to an estimated @xmath41 c and to desorb most of the residues remaining on the surface of the device from the fabrication steps . </S>",
    "<S> while current annealing has been shown to improved the quality of electrical transport in unsuspended devices , the treatment did not lead to significant mobility enhancement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> most likely , impurities permanently trapped at the interface between graphene and the substrate are responsible for this lack of improvement . </S>",
    "<S> suspended devices , on the other hand , are not be subject to such limitations , since impurities from both sides of the graphene sheet are free to desorb . </S>",
    "<S> current annealing is implemented by ramping the current across the device up to a predefined setpoint , waiting for several minutes , decreasing the current to zero and remeasuring the electrical transport properties of the specimen . </S>",
    "<S> the procedure is applied repeatedly until changes appear in the gate response of the device , which start to occur only at very large current densities of @xmath42 a/@xmath0 , estimated assuming a graphene thickness 0.34 nm .     as a function of gate voltage @xmath18 for the device # 1 before ( blue ) and after ( red ) current annealing ; data from traditional high - mobility device on the substrate ( gray dotted line ) shown for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> the gate voltage is limited to @xmath385 v range to avoid mechanical collapse . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) mobility @xmath43 as a function of carrier density @xmath32 for the same devices.,width=340 ]    for every device measured , current annealing leads to a remarkable difference in the transport properties compared to the initial state , which we illustrate using device # 1 as an example . upon current annealing , </S>",
    "<S> the resistance of sample # 1 decreases by more than a factor of 8 for voltages away from the dirac point . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> the width of the dirac peak reduces by about a factor of 20 , while the maximum resistivity of the device hardly changes ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2a ) . </S>",
    "<S> these large changes reflect a greatly improved sample quality . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify this improvement via three different measures : carrier mobility , width of the dirac peak and the onset field of shubnikov dehaas oscillations .    our first measure of sample quality is carrier mobility @xmath25 evaluated at high electron density , where @xmath25 saturates . in unsuspended devices , the mobility ranges between 2,000 and 25,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 with @xmath44 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 at @xmath4510@xmath46 @xmath5 being the highest value reported in the literature @xcite . due to the gate voltage limitation in our devices </S>",
    "<S> we measure the mobility at a smaller density @xmath4710@xmath4 @xmath5 , where the highest reported @xmath25 is about 30,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> this value is comparable to the mobility of 28,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , blue line ) in the suspended sample # 1 before current annealing . upon current annealing , </S>",
    "<S> the resistance decrease in sample # 1 translates into an increase of mobility to 230,000 @xmath0v@xmath48 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , red line ) measured at our highest density of @xmath4710@xmath4 @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> every suspended device exhibits mobilities higher than 60,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 after annealing . </S>",
    "<S> our peak mobility of 230,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 represents an improvement of about a factor of 10 over values reported in the literature so far , and is the central result of this work .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the mobility enhancement , we notice that the dirac peak of suspended and annealed samples is very narrow compared to both that of suspended devices before annealing and traditional substrate supported devices . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the width of the dirac peak is related to the charge inhomogeneity inside the sample . </S>",
    "<S> as has been demonstrated recently , at small charge densities the graphene breaks into mesoscopic puddles of hole and electrons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism causing the formation of puddles is debated @xcite , but it is accepted that the presence of puddles changes transport characteristics , resulting in a broadened dirac peak . </S>",
    "<S> we quantify the changes in sample quality by measuring @xmath49 , defined as twice the carrier density at which the resistivity decreases by a factor of two from its maximum value . </S>",
    "<S> such @xmath49 provides an upper bound for the charge inhomogeneity due to puddle formation . in device # 1 , for example </S>",
    "<S> , the dirac peak narrows to about 2@xmath310@xmath50 @xmath5 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , red line ) , an improvement of more than 10 times compared to the same sample before annealing ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2b , blue line ) and compared to typical high mobility unsuspended devices ( fig . 2b , black dotted line ) . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the reduced charge inhomogeneity is correlated with enhanced carrier mobility ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3b ) . compared to unsuspended samples ( black squares ) where a typical charge inhomogeneity is 2 - 9@xmath310@xmath4 @xmath5 while the mobility ranges from 2,000 - 30,000 @xmath0v@xmath1s@xmath1 , the suspended and annealed samples ( red circles ) exhibit both an order of magnitude higher mobility and an order of magnitude lower charge inhomogeneity , following the trend seen in the unsuspended devices .    finally , we turn to the onset of the shubnikov dehaas oscillations as a measure of sample quality . in a simple model , </S>",
    "<S> these oscillations commence at magnetic field @xmath51 strong enough for a charge carrier to complete one cyclotron orbit without scattering , which is equivalent to @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the cyclotron frequency and @xmath54 is the scattering time . in graphene , a semiclassical relation yields @xmath55 , where @xmath56 m / s is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this results in an estimate @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3a shows the sdh effect in our highest mobility specimen , sample # 1 . </S>",
    "<S> oscillations are observed as low as @xmath58 mt ( fig 3a , red line ) , while no sdh oscillations are observed before current annealing ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3a , blue line ) . </S>",
    "<S> other suspended devices exhibit @xmath51 ranging from 250 to 600 mt , and we estimate @xmath59 s for the best device at @xmath40 @xmath5 . on the other hand , in unsuspended devices sdh oscillations at the same density are seen at fields larger than @xmath2 700 mt , corresponding to @xmath60 s. therefore , the early onset of shubnikov dehaas oscillation in the suspended devices is consistent with reduced electron scattering time and thus is indicative of cleaner samples . </S>",
    "<S> while the onset of the sdh oscillations is a qualitative measure for sample quality , we can not deduce directly a quantum scattering time @xmath61 , since other factors , such as density inhomogeneity , also affect the onset .     </S>",
    "<S> component of hall resistance as a function of magnetic field for the suspended sample # 1 before annealing ( blue ) and after annealing ( red ) at @xmath40 @xmath5 and @xmath62 k. ( b ) full width at half maximum of the dirac peak @xmath49 plotted as a function of device mobility @xmath25 for all three measured suspended devices ( red circles ) and previously studied devices on the substrate ( black squares ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) conductivity @xmath63 as a function of carrier density @xmath32 for the sample # 1 after current annealing.,width=340 ]    summarizing the results of our transport measurements on in - situ annealed , suspended graphene samples , we observe a considerable improvement in sample quality measured by the enhanced mobility , reduced sample inhomogeneity and increased scattering time . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we observe about an order of magnitude improvement in carrier mobility and sample homogeneity , while the improvement in the onset field of the sdh oscillations is about factor of 3 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we conclude that our fabrication procedure results in very clean samples containing far fewer scatterers compared to the previously studied substrate supported devices . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , suspended samples prior to current annealing as well as current annealed but unsuspended samples @xcite do not exhibit the aforementioned quality improvement . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that impurities trapped between the sio@xmath6 and graphene are limiting the mobility of the current generation of unsuspended graphene devices .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we consider the nature of the residual scatterers in our devices . upon current annealing , </S>",
    "<S> the carrier mean free path @xmath64 in our samples approaches the typical dimensions of the device . indeed , using a semiclassical relation between the mobility and the mean free path @xcite @xmath65 , where @xmath66 , we estimate @xmath67 m for the sample # 1 at @xmath40 @xmath5 . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> both the edges of the device and the electrodes may contribute considerably to scattering . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the observed strongly sublinear dependence of the conductivity @xmath68 as a function of carrier density @xmath32 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> such behavior was argued to result from the short - range scattering @xcite , typically associated with point defects or sample edges . </S>",
    "<S> overall , we speculate that extrinstic sources of scattering may still be the limiting factor in the present geometry and that larger area devices may exhibit even higher mobilities . </S>"
