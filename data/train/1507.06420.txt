    "the abundant progress in nano - science and technology has stimulated us to fabricate different artificial nano - structures over the last few decades whose dimensions are comparable to and even smaller than the mean free paths or wavelengths of electrons such that they can move through the samples without randomizing their phase memories  @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of phase coherence length is one of the most striking aspects in the mesoscopic regime which can be obtained by lowering the temperature of the samples below sub - kelvin temperatures since the scatterings due to electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions are highly suppressed in this temperature regime .",
    "such experimentally accessible low - temperatures also make the system energy levels behave like discrete states which play a pivotal role in appearing several quantum - mechanical phenomena .",
    "therefore , a mesoscopic system which can be modeled as a phase - coherent elastic scatterer  @xcite provides us the opportunity to explore various novel quantum - mechanical effects beyond the atomic realm  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realization of different quantum - mechanical incidents like , universal conductance fluctuations , non - local current - voltage relationship , new onsager reciprocity relations , coulomb blockade in micro - tunnel junctions  @xcite , anderson localization  @xcite , quantum hall - effect  @xcite , aharonov - bohm ( ab ) oscillations  @xcite , to name a few , has raised the popularity of the mesoscopic world among the scientists and engineers .",
    "another reason behind this popularity can be attributed to the tailor - made geometries which look very simple but have high potential from the application perspective .",
    "in addition , several other fluctuation patterns of the conductance are easily reproducible simply by tuning external parameters like , magnetic field , electric field , fermi level , etc .",
    "the existence of dissipationless current , the so - called persistent current , in a mesoscopic normal metal ring pierced by an ab flux @xmath0 is one of such remarkable effects which reveals the importance of phase coherence of electronic wave functions in low - dimensional quantum systems .",
    "the alluring question of persistent current in normal - metal rings threaded an ab flux was first explored during 1960 s  @xcite .",
    "later , in @xmath3 , bttiker _",
    "have revived the interest regarding this topic  @xcite .",
    "they have predicted that a small isolated normal metal ring penetrated by a slowly varying magnetic flux carries an equilibrium current which does not decay and circulates within the sample .",
    "but its experimental realization was somewhat difficult because at that time it was a challenging task to confine magnetic flux in such a small region like nanoscale ring",
    ". however , a few years later levy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have given first experimental evidence of persistent current in a mesoscopic metallic ring .",
    "they have observed the oscillations with period @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , the elementary flux - quantum ) while measuring persistent current in an ensemble of @xmath6 independent cu rings .",
    "similar oscillations with period @xmath4 have also been reported not only for an ensemble of disconnected @xmath7 ag rings  @xcite but also for an array of @xmath7 isolated gaas - algaas rings  @xcite . later , many other theoretical  @xcite as well as experimental  @xcite attempts have been done to explore the actual mechanisms of persistent current in single - channel rings and multi - channel cylinders . however",
    ", a controversy still persists among the experimental observations and theoretical estimates of persistent current amplitudes .",
    "all the experimentally measured current amplitudes were found to be one and two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretically predicted results , except in the case of nearly ballistic gaas - algaas rings  @xcite where @xmath8-periodic persistent currents have been observed with amplitude @xmath9 ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the fermi velocity and circumference of the ring , respectively ) , which is very close to the value obtained from the free electron theory at absolute zero temperature ( @xmath12k ) . in a recent work ,",
    "bluhm _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have examined magnetic response of @xmath13 individual cold mesoscopic gold rings , considering one ring at a time , using a scanning squid technique .",
    "their results agree well with the theoretically estimated value  @xcite in a single ballistic ring  @xcite and an ensemble of @xmath14 nearly ballistic rings  @xcite .",
    "but , the amplitudes of persistent current in single - isolated - diffusive gold rings  @xcite are still two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical calculations .",
    "this discrepancy initiated intense theoretical activity , and it is generally believed that the electron - electron correlation plays an important role in the disordered diffusive rings  @xcite .",
    "an explanation based on the perturbative calculation in presence of interaction and disorder has been proposed and it seems to give a quantitative estimate closer to the experimental results , but still it is less than the measured currents by an order of magnitude , and the interaction parameter used in the theory is not well understood physically .",
    "the behavior of persistent current in an isolated loop geometry enclosing a magnetic flux is highly sensitive to the location of fermi level of the system where the role of magnetic flux is essentially to destroy the time - reversal symmetry and as a result , the degeneracies among the current - carrying states get removed .",
    "depending on the fermi level and the direction of the magnetic flux current flows in either direction revealing diamagnetic or paramagnetic nature .",
    "since the discovery persistent current have been studying in different kinds of mesoscopic loop structures . among them",
    "single channel mesoscopic rings  @xcite were mainly in the focus of attention in spite of having topological simplicity they carry a high potential from the application point of view . not only single isolated rings but also array of such rings have been used to study the nature of persistent current .",
    "a very few works on multi - channel closed loop systems have been discussed  @xcite . in case of multi - channel mesoscopic cylinders",
    "it has been noticed that the typical single - level current gets reduced with increasing number of conducting channels @xmath15 .",
    "the correlations in the energy spectrum governs that the ratio of the total and single - level currents is proportional to @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "similar to persistent current in such isolated closed loop geometries , the non - decaying charge current is also observed in open loop systems  @xcite , where rings / cylinders are coupled to source and drain electrodes . in @xmath17",
    ", bttiker has introduced a conceptually simple and elegant approach  @xcite to investigate the effect of an electron reservoir on persistent current in a loop penetrated by a magnetic flux .",
    "the reservoir is considered as a source of dissipation and the inelastic scattering processes take place only within this reservoir to which the loop is attached via a single current lead while the other scatterings occur in the lead are assumed to be elastic .",
    "so , there exists a complete spatial separation between the elastic and inelastic scatterings . the reservoir being a sink of electrons maintained the chemical potential of the loop to a fixed value .",
    "this modifies the statistical mechanical treatment of the system to a different ensemble , the grand canonical ensemble where close systems ( in absence of lead and reservoir ) belong to canonical ensemble average .",
    "this establishes a remarkable difference between the study of closed and open loop systems from the statistical point of view .",
    "experimental verification of persistent current in open system was first done by mailly _",
    "et al . _ in 1993  @xcite .",
    "they have examined both closed and open systems and detected a periodic signal carrying the signature of persistent current which was in agreement with the theory . after those pioneering works last two decades have witnessed several approaches to reveal the properties of persistent currents in open systems .",
    "unlike the behavior of the other physical quantity such as conductance , persistent current in open system is sensitive to the direction of the transport current and this property is helpful for recognizing this current from the other currents ( noise ) associated with experimental measurements . in open systems , persistent current can appear even in absence of external magnetic field  @xcite as the lead - current , the current from the source to drain , plays the role of the driving force .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown theoretically the flow of persistent current in an open metallic loop connecting to two electron reservoirs .",
    "they have taken the lengths of the two arms of the loop unequal which results in a circulating current in the loop .",
    "instead of setting the arm - lengths unequal one can also introduce any local scatterer anywhere in the geometry to establish a circular flow within the loop geometry in non - equilibrium situation . on the other hand , in an equilibrium condition",
    "i.e. , when the chemical potentials of both leads are same , persistent current can still arise due to evanescent modes .",
    "in a work by jayannavar _",
    "et al . _ the phenomenon of persistent current due to two non - classical effects , ab effect and quantum mechanical tunneling has been studied in detail  @xcite .",
    "although the studies involving persistent current in single - channel rings and multi - channel rings  @xcite or cylinders , both in the closed and open loop shapes , have already generated a wealth of literature there is still need to look deeper into the problem to address several significant issues those have not been well explored before as for examples the understanding of the distribution of persistent currents in different channels in presence of electron - electron interaction and disorder which inspect the net response of the full system and also the sensitivity of persistent current on disorder in partially disordered systems like shell - doped nanowires which can provide a unfamiliar electronic behavior rather than uniformly doped nanowires . in the present review we essentially concentrate on these issues .",
    "in the first part we address magneto - transport properties in a zigzag carbon nanotube , formed by rolling up a graphite ribbon in the cylindrical form  @xcite , with its detailed energy band structure in presence electron - electron interaction within a hartree - fock ( hf ) mean field approach using the second quantized formulation .",
    "since the isolation of a single layer graphene by novoselov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite intense and diverse research is going on to explore electronic transport in this system .",
    "graphene , a single layer of carbon atoms tightly packed into a two - dimensional honey - comb lattice , has drawn attention of scientists in various disciplines due to its unconventional and fascinating electronic properties arising particularly from the linear dispersion relation around the dirac points of the hexagonal brillouin zone .",
    "these unique properties can be understood in terms of the dirac hamiltonian  @xcite since it actually describes the physics of electrons near the fermi level of the undoped material .",
    "the carriers in graphene effectively behave as massless relativistic particles within a low energy range close to fermi energy and these massless dirac fermions  @xcite evince various phenomena in this energy range .",
    "the bipartite character of the wonderful lattice structure of graphene strongly influences its intrinsic properties and makes graphene a wonderful testbed for quantum field theory and mathematical physics as well as condensed matter theory . in the last few years extensive studies on persistent current in carbon nanotubes",
    "have been performed and many interesting physical phenomena have been explored  @xcite .",
    "persistent current in a carbon nanotube is highly sensitive to its radius , chirality , deformation , etc . in a recent experiment",
    "it has also been observed that the fermi energy of a carbon nanotube can be regulated nicely by means of electron or hole doping , which can induce a dramatic change in persistent current  @xcite .",
    "it is well established that in a conventional multi - channel mesoscopic cylinder electron transport strongly depends on the correlation among different channels as well as the shape of fermi surface .",
    "therefore , we might expect some interesting features of persistent current in a carbon nanotube due to its unique electronic structure . here",
    "we discuss the behavior of persistent current in different branches together with the total current of a zigzag carbon nanotube in presence of an ab flux .",
    "most of the works available in literature  @xcite generally investigate magnetic response of the entire system , but a complete knowledge of magnetic response in individual branches provide much better insight to the problem  @xcite .",
    "the phase reversal of persistent current in different branches as a function of electron - electron correlation is found to exhibit interesting pattern .",
    "our detailed numerical analysis suggests a filling - dependent metal - insulator ( mi ) transition in a zigzag carbon nanotube .",
    "in the second part , we concentrate on the behavior persistent current in an ordered - disordered separated nanotube considering a possible experimental realization of shell - doped nanowires which may provide several unusual electronic behavior rather than uniformly doped nanowires and have potential applications in nanoscale electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
    "in the last part we investigate persistent current together with average density of states ( ados ) in an open loop geometry where an ordered binary alloy ring threaded by a magnetic flux is clamped between two ideal semi - infinite metallic electrodes , commonly known as source and drain electrodes , followed by the characteristic properties of an isolated ordered binary alloy ring .",
    "inclusion of some foreign atoms in anyone of the two arms of the ring provides some interesting patterns in ados and from our numerical analysis we propose that under suitable choices of the parameter values the system can act as a @xmath1-type or an @xmath2-type semiconductor .    throughout the review",
    "we choose @xmath18 for numerical calculations and restrict ourselves at absolute zero temperature .",
    "this section is devoted to reveal the magnetic response of interacting electrons in a zigzag carbon nanotube enclosing a magnetic flux within a hf mean field approach . following the description of energy    spectra for both non - interacting and interacting cases we investigate the energy - flux characteristics , persistent current in individual branches of the system and also the net current of the entire system .",

    "unlike to the ordered binary alloy ring ( fig .  [ curr1 ] )",
    ", here all the energy eigenstates are not extended in nature .",
    "some localized energy levels appear in the band of extended energy states due to the presence of impurity sites in the ring .",
    "this is clearly visible from the spectra since for these impurity levels no current is available .",
    "we also check the periodicity of the persistent current . it is shown in fig .",
    "[ currfi ] .",
    "persistent current exhibits @xmath8 flux - quantum periodicity .",
    "thus , calculating persistent current we can emphasize the nature of energy eigenstates very nicely , and this idea can be utilized to reveal the localization properties of energy eigenstates in any complicated geometry .",
    "to conclude , in the present article we have made a detailed investigation of magneto - transport in both closed and open mesoscopic systems .",
    "we have started with the discussion of a zigzag nanotube pierced by a magnetic flux using a generalized hartree - fock mean field approach .",
    "based on the tight - binding model we explore the effect of the hubbard interaction on the energy levels of the tube . after describing different numerical results we have established the second quantized form to evaluate persistent current in individual paths of a zigzag carbon nanotube and based on this formulation we have also presented the numerical results for the distribution of persistent current in different branches of the nanotube . from the current - flux characteristics we have emphasized that the current amplitude in the zigzag nanotube is highly sensitive to the electron filling and this phenomenon can be utilized in designing a high conducting to a low conducting switching device and vice versa . following the study of nanotube",
    "we have explored the persistent current in an ordered - disordered separated cylinder penetrated by a magnetic flux .",
    "most interestingly , we have seen that the current amplitude shows an anomalous behavior with the increase of impurity strength .",
    "this study may be helpful for exploring localization - delocalization transition in shell - doped nanotubes . to discuss persistent current in open system i.e. , system with side - attached electrodes",
    "we have considered a binary alloy ring in presence of a magnetic flux @xmath0 , as an illustrative example . within a single - band non - interacting tb framework",
    "persistent current and band structure of an isolated ordered binary alloy ring have been analyzed .",
    "then , we have explored the magneto - transport properties of a binary alloy ring in presence of external electrodes .",
    "the effect of impurities have also been addressed .",
    "quite interestingly we have noticed that in the presence of some foreign atoms , those are not necessarily be random , in any part of the ring , some quasi - localized energy levels appear within the band of extended energy levels .",
    "the locations of these almost localized energy levels can also be regulated by means of some external gate voltage .",
    "this leads to a possibility of using such a system as a @xmath1-type or an @xmath2-type semiconductor by fixing the fermi level in appropriate places .",
    "before we end , we would like to mention that in the present review we have addressed some important aspects of quantum transport through some low - dimensional model quantum systems .",
    "several other important quantum phenomena in such meso- and nano - scale systems have also been reported in recent reviews  @xcite ."
