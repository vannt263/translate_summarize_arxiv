    ", the photon acquires a structure leading to the interaction of two structured objects .",

    "higher fock states ( e.g. @xmath11 ) in the wave function of the photon may lead to a hard pomeron behaviour of the @xmath12 cross section .    in the framework of a model containing a soft and a hard pomeron we perform in the present paper a fit to hera data on @xmath4 together with data from nmc and e665 in a kinematical window given by @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 , with @xmath16 representing the @xmath8 _ cm _ energy .",
    "moreover , all data on the total absorption cross section @xmath5 of real photons with @xmath15 are considered .",
    "the fit includes four free parameters .",
    "our investigation is a natural extension of previous work  @xcite , where @xmath4 at fixed @xmath16 @xmath17 has been studied as a function of @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite only a soft pomeron contribution , derived in the stochastic vacuum model ( svm )  @xcite , has been taken into account .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to study the importance of the soft pomeron as given by the svm in the low @xmath0 and low @xmath1 region of hera .",
    "the svm is a specific model of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "it lives on the assumption that the infrared behaviour of qcd can be approximated by a gaussian stochastic process . as central quantity of",
    "the svm serves the correlator of the gluon field strength ( nonlocal gluon condensate ) , which consists of an abelian and a non - abelian part , where the non - abelian correlator gives rise to linear confinement in terms of the wilson area law .",
    "three parameters determine the correlator : the overall normalization is given by the local gluon condensate @xmath18 , while the correlation length @xmath19 fixes the shape of the correlator in coordinate space .",
    "finally , the parameter @xmath20 regulates the relative weigth of the abelian and the non - abelian term .",
    "these parameters are proper quantities of nonperturbative qcd and can be obtained from lattice simulations .",
    "more details on the technical aspects of the svm may be found e.g. in ref .",

    "an expression for the dipole - dipole scattering amplitude of the svm has been derived  @xcite .",
    "any diffractive reaction involving hadrons or photons can be calculated by means of the dipole - dipole amplitude and the wave functions of the particles . besides studies on @xmath4  @xcite",
    ", the svm has been applied to the hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite , photo- and electroproduction of vector mesons  @xcite and of @xmath21  @xcite , and in a very recent work to the @xmath22-interaction  @xcite .    in the color - dipole picture of high - energy scattering",
    "the cross section depends on the sizes of the scattered particles . as a consequence , for instance the value of about 2/3 for the ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath24 total cross sections",
    "can naturally be explained by the different radii of @xmath25 and @xmath26 . though the svm gives a prediction for the dipole - dipole cross section as function of the dipole sizes , the resulting cross sections are energy - independent .",
    "in particular , the @xmath27 dependence of soft high - energy hadron - hadron scattering  @xcite does not follow from the svm .",
    "( according to a recent work  @xcite a behaviour like @xmath28 gives a better fit to hadron - hadron cross sections . )",
    "any energy - dependence of the scattering amplitude of the svm has to be incorporated in a phenomenological way .    in order to explain the increase of @xmath4 at low @xmath0 and finite @xmath1",
    "the soft pomeron behaviour of hadron - hadron scattering is not sufficient .",
    "therefore , in our treatment we keep the energy - independent prediction of the svm as soft pomeron and add , similar to other approaches ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , a hard pomeron component .",
    "for quite some time the bfkl - mechanism ( exchange of a gluon - ladder )  @xcite has been considered as microscopic explanation of a hard pomeron exchange . however , due to the poor convergence of this perturbative approach  @xcite , the status of the bfkl - pomeron is more than ever unclear . because of this situation , and the fact that we are mainly interested in the behaviour of the soft pomeron , we start from a simple ansatz for the hard pomeron as derived by lpez and yndurin  @xcite and obtained by the leading order dglap evolution  @xcite of @xmath4 .",
    "we modify the solution of the dglap equation by multiplying a phenomenological factor , leading to a parametrization which can be applied in the limit @xmath29 without introducing a singularity in the cross section of photoproduction . as a consequence of this modification",
    "our hard pomeron component is no longer , strictly speaking , a solution of the dglap equation in the nonperturbative region of low @xmath1 .    in the analysis we neglect a contribution from meson exchange , being aware of the fact that at @xmath30 the trajectories of @xmath31 and @xmath32 give rise to an effect of about @xmath33",
    "nevertheless , a consideration of the meson exchange introduces new parameters but has only minor influence on the main results of our investigation .",

    "we have presented a two - component model for inclusive @xmath12 scattering , which consists of a soft and a hard pomeron and is suitable in the region of low @xmath0 and low @xmath153 .",
    "the four free parameters of the model have been adjusted to the available data on the structure function @xmath4 of the proton ( for @xmath176 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) and on the total cross section of real photoabsorption ( for @xmath15 ) .",
    "the fit includes 222 data points and leads to the result @xmath7 .",
    "the soft pomeron has been calculated from the stochastic vacuum model , which can be considered as an approximation of qcd in the infrared region .",
    "the svm describes the complicated structure of the qcd vacuum in terms of a nonlocal gluon condensate , where the variation of the condensate in minkowski space - time is governed by the correlation length @xmath19 . in the framework of the svm ,",
    "diffractive scattering of two particles is equivalent to the scattering of two wegner - wilson - loops , leading automatically to cross sections in the color - dipole picture . to fix the distribution of the loops in the transverse space , valence quark wave functions of the particles have to be introduced .",
    "the wave function of the photon has been determined in perturbation theory and accounts for the fluctuation of the @xmath177 into a @xmath10 state .",
    "this description differs from vmd frequently used in the region of low @xmath1 .",
    "a reasonable simultaneous description of @xmath4 and @xmath5 for low and high @xmath16 by means of vmd is difficult , and requires in general further parameters .",
    "vmd of the photon enters in our picture only through the determination of the quark masses by quark - hadron duality  @xcite , and hence in a indirect way .",
    "the soft pomeron contains only one free parameter which regulates the overall normalization of the @xmath1-dependent quark masses in the photon wave function .",
    "compared to previous work on @xmath4 at fixed @xmath132  @xcite , performed only with a soft pomeron , our fit favors a reduction of the quark masses by @xmath83 .",
    "such a reduction improves also e.g. the cross section for photoproduction of @xmath178-mesons  @xcite .",
    "the remaining ( four ) parameters of the soft pomeron have been taken from other sources and left unchanged  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections of the svm are energy - independent , contrary to the @xmath27 behaviour of the soft pomeron in hadron - hadron scattering . to describe the data on @xmath4 obtained in fixed - target experiments and at hera a hard pomeron has to be considered in addition .",
    "we have modeled a hard component by starting from the leading order qcd evolution of a power - behaved structure function @xmath164 ( @xmath179 )  @xcite . assuming a singular gluon input",
    ", the evolution does not produce a @xmath1-dependence in the intercept , and hence the result is not in conflict with regge theory .",
    "the result of the evolution has been multiplied by a simple phenomenological factor in order to obtain a finite cross section for real photoproduction .",
    "our fit leads to @xmath180 , which is close to a recently proposed value @xmath122 by donnachie and landshoff  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the fit have been used to calculate also the longitudinal structure function .",
    "like in the case of @xmath164 we have to modify the perturbative part of @xmath9 , which serves as starting - point for the hard component , by a phenomenologal factor in order to enforce a vanishing @xmath181 at @xmath182 .",
    "the numbers for the ratio @xmath173 are in good agreement with two data points from the nmc experiment . up to now",
    "there exist no hera data in the kinematical region of our fit .",
    "however , recent activities at hera will provide very soon final results from a direct measurement of @xmath9 at low @xmath153  @xcite .    during the last time many people investigated @xmath4 at low @xmath0 and especially at low @xmath1 with different models .",
    "the approaches comprise shadowing effects , pomerons with a @xmath1-dependent intercept , vmd calculations in combination with perturbative evolution and others ( see e.g. refs .",
    "moreover , two - component pomeron models have been applied to the @xmath12 interaction by various authors  @xcite . with a soft and a hard pomeron donnachie and landshoff  @xcite presented for a large kinematical region a very good fit to @xmath5 and @xmath4 using 10 parameters . in this work not only",
    "the intercepts , but also the residues of both pomerons were fitted .",
    "in contrast to this , the residue of our soft pomeron has been fixed by the svm and related to parameters of nonperturbative qcd .",
    "in addition , at higher values of @xmath1 , the residue of the hard pomeron follows the ( leading order ) evolution of qcd .",
    "our work strongly overlaps with the approach of adel , barreiro and yndurin  @xcite , since we are using essentially the same expression for the hard pomeron .",
    "however , we differ in the way of performing the limit @xmath29 in the hard part and , in particular , in the ansatz of the soft pomeron which is given by a single vmd - pole in  @xcite .",
    "the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained by a fit to data on @xmath4 , fails in describing the data on @xmath5 at low _",
    "cm _ energies .",
    "the work of rueter  @xcite , where a good description of the @xmath8 interaction was achieved , is also based on the svm and therefore closest to ours . as discussed in detail in sec .  2",
    ", we cut the soft proton - dipole cross section below the correlation length @xmath183 .",
    "the interaction of small dipoles is taken into account by the hard pomeron . a transition between soft and hard physics at distances of the order of the correlation length",
    "is suggested by lattice calculations of the field strength correlator  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the treatment of the dipole - proton cross section also changes for @xmath184 .",
    "contrary to our approach , rueter still makes use of the residue of the soft pomeron in the region of @xmath185 , but multiplies for this kinematics the cross section by the energy - dependence of a hard pomeron ( intercept 1.28 ) .",
    "dipoles with an extension smaller than @xmath186 are treated by perturbative two - gluon exchange .",
    "the extension of our two - component model to large @xmath1 still has to be analysed .",
    "moreover , one has to study the consequences in the case that our soft contribution is multiplied by the energy - dependence of the soft pomeron of hadron scattering .",
    "if the fit significantly improves we would interpret this result as a further hint that a soft pomeron leading to a slight energy - increase is required not only in the interactions of hadrons but also in @xmath12 interaction .",
