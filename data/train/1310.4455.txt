    "the recent enormous improvement of our knowledge of the neutrino oscillation parameters suggests a detailed investigation of the current constraints on the neutrino mass matrix .",
    "most of these constraints depend on the assumed nature of neutrinos ( dirac or majorana ) .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . after a brief general discussion of the light - neutrino mass matrix in section  [ section - neutrino_mass_matrix ]",
    ", we will investigate the implications of the currently available data on the majorana neutrino mass matrix in section  [ section - majorana ] . in section  [ section - dirac ]",
    "we will discuss constraints on the neutrino mass matrix in the dirac case .",
    "finally we will conclude in section  [ section - conclusions ] .",
    "in this paper we assume that there are exactly three light neutrino mass eigenstates with masses smaller than @xmath0 , _",
    "i.e. _  we assume that there are no light sterile neutrinos . by the term `` neutrino mass matrix ''",
    "we thus always mean the @xmath1 mass matrix of the three light neutrinos .",
    "if neutrinos are _ majorana particles _",
    ", we assume that there is a ( possibly effective ) mass term @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a complex symmetric @xmath1-matrix .",
    "such a mass term directly arises from the type - ii seesaw mechanism and can be effectively generated via the seesaw mechanisms of type i and iii .    if neutrinos are dirac particles , _",
    "i.e. _  if the total lepton number is conserved , we assume the existence of three right - handed neutrino fields @xmath4 leading to the mass term @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an arbitrary complex @xmath1-matrix .",
    "before we can discuss any constraints on the neutrino mass matrix , we have to specify a basis in flavour space . in models involving flavour symmetries ,",
    "the chosen matrix representations of the flavour symmetry group specify the basis .",
    "since we will at this point not assume any flavour symmetries in the lepton sector , we are free to choose a basis . for simplicity we will always choose a basis in which the charged - lepton mass matrix is given by @xmath7",
    "in the basis specified by equation  ( [ mldiag ] ) the majorana neutrino mass matrix has the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the lepton mixing matrix and the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) are the masses of the three light neutrinos . as any unitary @xmath1-matrix",
    ", @xmath9 can be parameterized by six phases and three mixing angles .",
    "we will use the parameterization @xmath12 with @xmath13 the phases @xmath14 and @xmath15 are unphysical since they may be eliminated by a suitable redefinition of the charged - lepton fields . on the contrary , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are physical in the case of majorana neutrinos and are therefore referred to as the majorana phases .",
    "@xmath18 denotes the well - known unitary matrix @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the sines and cosines of the three mixing angles , respectively .",
    "the phase @xmath22 is responsible for a possible cp violation in neutrino oscillations ( also in the dirac case ) and is therefore frequently referred to as the dirac cp phase .",
    "the fact that the neutrino masses are the _ singular values _ of @xmath3 allows to derive a generic upper bound on the absolute values @xmath23 . from linear algebra",
    "it is known that the absolute value of an element of a matrix is smaller or equal its largest singular value . for the neutrino mass matrix this implies  @xcite @xmath24",
    "since this bound is valid for _ any _ matrix , it holds also for dirac neutrinos .",
    "the strongest bounds on the absolute neutrino mass scale come from cosmology , where the sum of the masses of the light neutrinos is usually constrained to be at most of the order @xmath25see _ e.g. _  the list of upper bounds in  @xcite . from this",
    "we deduce the approximate upper bound @xmath26 leading to @xmath27    in  @xcite also an analytical lower bound on the @xmath23 is provided . defining @xmath28",
    "one can show that @xmath29 note that this lower bound is independent of the majorana phases @xmath16 and @xmath17 . unlike the generic upper bound discussed before , the lower bound  ( [ lowerbound ] ) is valid only for majorana neutrinos . numerically evaluating this lower bound using the results of the global fits of oscillation data of  @xcite only for two matrix elements leads to non - trivial lower bounds .",
    "the lower bounds in units of ev for these matrix elements are given by  @xcite :    [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^,^ \" , ]     all of these five correlations may be subsumed as `` if one matrix element is small , the other one must be large . ''",
    "an example for such a correlation plot can be found in figure  [ fig : m11-m33normal ] .    in the case of an inverted neutrino mass spectrum ,",
    "there are no correlations manifest at the @xmath30-level .",
    "it is important to note that while at the @xmath30-level the correlation plots based on the global fits of  @xcite and  @xcite agree , this is not true at the @xmath31-level  for further details see  @xcite .",
    "in analogy to the majorana case , we will study the @xmath1 dirac neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal  see equation  ( [ mldiag ] ) . in this basis @xmath6 takes the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a unitary @xmath1-matrix .",
    "@xmath33 can be eliminated by considering the matrix @xmath34 since all observables accessible by current experimental scrutiny are contained in @xmath35 , all matrices @xmath6 leading to the same @xmath35 are _ indistinguishable _ from the experimental point of view .",
    "therefore , the nine parameters of @xmath36 have to be treated as _ free _ parameters .",
    "consequently , in stark contrast to the majorana case , in the dirac case the neutrino mass matrix has at least nine free parameters ( even if the mixing matrix and the neutrino masses are known ) .    this freedom of choosing @xmath33 has important consequences for the analysis of @xmath6 .",
    "obviously it is much harder to put constraints on the elements of @xmath6 than in the majorana case .",
    "the freedom of choosing @xmath33 even allows to set several elements of @xmath6 to zero without changing the physical predictions .",
    "this directly follows from the fact that every matrix can be decomposed into a product of a unitary matrix and an upper triangular matrix .",
    "thus there is a choice of @xmath33 such that @xmath37 similarly , by multiplication of @xmath6 by one of the six @xmath1 permutation matrices generated by @xmath38 from the left , one can arbitrarily permute the rows of @xmath6 without changing any physical predictions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is most important to note that the freedom of choosing @xmath33 holds only as long as we do not impose a symmetry in the lepton sector .",
    "namely , a flavour symmetry which acts non - trivially in the neutrino sector imposes constraints on the form of the neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _  not only on the neutrino masses and @xmath9 but also on @xmath33 .",
    "consequently , a choice of @xmath33 , _",
    "e.g. _  such that @xmath6 is upper triangular , will in general be incompatible with the flavour symmetry . nevertheless ,",
    "if we want to set bounds on the elements of @xmath6 ( without introducing flavour symmetries ) , we indeed have the freedom of arbitrarily choosing the matrix @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , examining bounds and correlations of the elements of @xmath6 is much less elucidating than in the majorana case .",
    "that said , studies of @xmath6 such as the question for the allowed cases of texture zeros in @xmath6 are still of great interest .      in the following",
    "we will shortly comment on the allowed cases of texture zeros in @xmath6 under the assumption that @xmath39 is diagonal .",
    "a detailed analysis has been done by hagedorn and rodejohann in  @xcite , which provides a classification of all possible texture zeros in this framework .",
    "we repeated the analysis of  @xcite of the allowed cases of five , four and three texture zeros are investigated , the result being that all these cases are allowed and do not show any relations among the observables . ] in @xmath6 based on the global fit results of  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results are in perfect agreement with the analysis of  @xcite . however , there are some previously allowed cases of texture zeros which can be excluded due to the new data , namely precisely those which lead to a vanishing or too small value ( @xmath40 ) of @xmath41 ,",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46@xmath47 , @xmath48@xmath49 , @xmath50 ( inverted spectrum ) and @xmath51 ( inverted spectrum ) in the notation of  @xcite .",
    "consequently , all cases of five texture zeros in @xmath6 are now excluded , and among the cases of four texture zeros only @xmath50 ( normal spectrum ) , @xmath51 ( normal spectrum ) as well as @xmath52@xmath53 remain valid .",
    "in the case of majorana neutrinos , the absolute values of the elements of the light - neutrino mass matrix @xmath3 can be described by nine parameters , of which seven are constrained by experiments / observations .",
    "the by now very precise knowledge of the oscillation parameters therefore allows detailed studies of the elements of @xmath3 , including their allowed ranges and their correlations .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of dirac neutrinos , where the neutrino mass matrix @xmath6 is by far not uniquely determined , even if the neutrino masses and the mixing matrix are known . therefore putting bounds on the elements of @xmath6",
    "is much harder than in the majorana case .",
    "nevertheless studies of @xmath6 are possible , for example the analysis of texture zeros in @xmath6 .",
    "we reinvestigated the allowed texture zeros of @xmath6 in the basis where the charged - lepton mass matrix is diagonal .",
    "our results agree with the original analysis  @xcite , the only difference being that by now we know that @xmath54 , which excludes some previously viable types of texture zeros .",
