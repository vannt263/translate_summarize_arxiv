    "in the atomic nucleus , the properties of the unbound states are fundamental to the nuclear structures and reactions .",
    "the recent experimental developments in the field of unstable nuclear physics , starting from the discovery of neutron halo structure in the neutron - rich nuclei such as @xmath1he and @xmath2li , have shown the various interesting phenomena related to the unbound states of nuclei @xcite . in unstable nuclei , a few extra nucleons are bound to the system with small binding energies .",
    "this fact indicates that unstable nuclei can easily emit one or two nucleons with small excitation energies around a few mev .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the position of the lowest threshold is very close to the ground state and that the coupling effect of the continuum states becomes important even in the ground state .",
    "this property of unstable nuclei is quite different from that of stable nuclei , in which the average binding energy is about 8 mev per nucleon @xcite .",
    "one of the interesting features of the unstable nuclei is their so - called borromean nature , in which no two - body subsystem has the bound states . with this feature",
    ", the constituents of the system can have a bound state in the three - body case and the lowest threshold is of a three - body emission , not of a two - body one .",
    "this condition requires both experimental and theoretical studies of the unbound states in the subsystem .",
    "the physics of unstable nuclei is extended to the understanding of the scattering properties of the nuclei .",
    "there are many experiments to investigate the scattering states of unstable nuclei , such as the observation of new resonances in the spectroscopy , the various responses to an external coulomb field , and the breakup reactions of an unstable nucleus as a projectile . in theory",
    ", the unified description of structures and reactions is essential to the unstable nuclear physics .",
    "the resonances embedded in the scattering states provide important information on the structures of the compound system in addition to the scattering observables such as cross sections .",
    "nuclear resonances are described by applying the @xmath3-matrix theory @xcite , which was developed by kapur and peierls @xcite , and characterized using the resonance energy and width @xcite .",
    "they are often expressed by a complex energy and theoretically calculated as a pole of the @xmath4-matrix .",
    "however , it is difficult for such conventional methods to treat many - body resonances and non - resonant continuum states . here",
    ", we refer to the states decaying into more than two - body constituents as  many - body resonances . \" a significant development in the treatment of resonances from two - body systems to many - body systems has been brought about via the complex scaling method ( csm ) @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the csm plays an important role not only in investigations of the problems of many - body resonances but also in the description of the non - resonant many - body continuum states .",
    "these states are indispensable to produce the nuclear reaction phenomena .",
    "the aim of this article is to provide a brief review of the csm in nuclear physics and its applications to many - body resonant and continuum states of light unstable nuclei .",
    "originally , the csm was proposed by aguilar , combes , and balslev in 1971 @xcite .",
    "simon advocated this method as a direct approach of obtaining many - body resonances @xcite .",
    "the use of  direct \" implies that the resonance wave functions are directly obtained with complex energy eigenvalues of the quantum many - body system by solving an eigenvalue problem of the complex - scaled schrdinger equation , @xmath5 with a real scaling angle @xmath6 . in the csm , the boundary condition of the outgoing wave @xcite is implemented automatically for resonances .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the bound and resonant states are shown to correspond to the poles of the @xmath4-matrix : for a bound state , the energy @xmath7 is obtained using a real and negative eigenvalue and invariant with respect to the scaling transformation . for a resonance , the resonance energy @xmath8 and the decay width @xmath9",
    "are obtained using the complex energy eigenvalues @xmath10 . in the csm , the resonances are described by square - integrable ( @xmath0 ) wave functions , the norms of which are definable , similar to the bound states .",
    "this property of the resonance wave functions enables the application of the csm to various theoretical approaches describing the nucleus .",
    "the csm has thus far been extensively applied to atomic and molecular physics and has been reviewed by ho @xcite and moiseyev @xcite in the framework of the non - hermitian quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore , the csm has been developed for obtaining scattering cross sections as well as resonance positions @xcite .",
    "there is a discussion of the relation between the energy of the resonance pole and the peak energy of the cross section @xcite . in atomic and molecular physics , recent development of the theory of resonances has been reported ; for example , hatano _ et al .",
    "_ discuss the resonance theory for discrete models such as quantum dots @xcite and also for the complete set in the open quantum systems @xcite .",
    "moiseyev has developed the scattering collision theory using complex scaling in his review work @xcite , where several methods of describing resonances are explained such as in terms of the level density and phase shifts , in addition to the csm .",
    "moiseyev and his collaborators have also developed the description of resonances in terms of the wave - packet propagation within the time - dependent approach @xcite .    in atomic and molecular physics ,",
    "the dominant interaction in the system is the long - range coulomb force . on the other hand , in nuclear physics ,",
    "the dominant interaction is the short - range one , the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath11 ) interaction , which is determined to reproduce the observables of the two - nucleon systems . a typical range of the @xmath11 interaction is given by the one - pion exchange as around 1.4 fm @xcite .",
    "owing to the short - range nature of the @xmath11 interaction , we can avoid the problem arising from the long - range interaction except for the proton - proton coulomb part .",
    "for example , we can expand the nuclear many - body wave functions with the finite - range basis sets which are often analytical like harmonic oscillator and gaussian functions .",
    "these functions are taken to cover the range of the nuclear interaction inside the nuclei . for scattering states",
    ", we can decompose the wave function into the inner part of the interaction region and the outer non - interacting asymptotic part .",
    "this decomposition is useful to describe resonances . in this review",
    ", we apply this approach to the lippmann - schwinger equation with complex scaling to describe the three - body scattering process of nuclei @xcite .    in 1971 ,",
    "gyarmati and vertse @xcite showed that the complex - scaled wave functions for resonances provide the same matrix elements as those obtained using the convergence factor method @xcite , which was introduced to regularize the singular behavior of resonance wave functions in the asymptotic region .",
    "after that , the csm has often been used in the nuclear cluster model @xcite ; in this model , the relative motion between clusters are transformed in the csm .",
    "the csm applications have been increasing in recent years particularly , in the cluster physics and unstable nuclear physics .",
    "resonant states are usually described using scattering solutions of the schrdinger equation .",
    "the properties of the states have been discussed in the nuclear reaction theory , as seen in a series of papers by humblet and rosenfeld @xcite . using a different approach ,",
    "berggren attempted to describe the resonant state as an extended concept of the bound state @xcite .",
    "he proposed an extended completeness relation @xcite which includes explicitly the resonance poles of the @xmath4-matrix by introducing deformed contours on the complex momentum plane .",
    "recently , the method of complex contour deformation has been adopted in preparing the single particle basis states in the shell model like approaches to describe weakly bound states @xcite .    in the csm ,",
    "rotation of the momentum axis corresponds to one kind of contour deformation for describing the poles of bound and resonant states in the same region of the complex momentum plane .",
    "therefore , the csm can treat bound and resonant states equally including many - body resonances .",
    "it can be understood that the csm is based on the generalization of the idea of berggren for resonances , which are regarded as the extensions of the bound states .",
    "various kinds of bound states and resonances are generated by the hamiltonian @xmath12 and are obtainable by diagonalizing the complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath13 using the @xmath0 basis functions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_abc ] , we show a schematic distribution of the eigenvalues of the many - body hamiltonian @xmath13 . along with the bound states ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) located below the lowest threshold , the bound states embedded in continuum states are obtained ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , if they exist . above the thresholds ,",
    "resonances are obtained with the complex eigenvalues ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . in the three - body system ,",
    "two - body and three - body resonances are obtained above the two - body and three - body thresholds , respectively . in the csm",
    ", it is not required to employ the asymptotic boundary conditions for the resonance wave functions , since such an asymptotic behavior of the resonant state is properly taken into account in the complex - scaled @xmath0 wave functions . beyond the three - body systems , the many - body eigenvalue distributions",
    "are generally explained by the extension of the three - body case .     in the complex energy plane .",

    "the lines with the angle of @xmath24 from the thresholds indicate the rotated branch cuts.,width=377 ]    another important advantage of the csm is with regard to the continuum states . for the original hamiltonian @xmath12 obtained without applying the csm , all continuum ( scattering )",
    "states start from the thresholds with real energies and these states are degenerate on the real energy axis . on the other hand , for the complex - scaled hamiltonian @xmath13 , these continuum states are distributed on the rotated cuts starting from different thresholds with a common angle of @xmath24 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_abc ] .",
    "the continuum spectra of @xmath13 are classified into two types of thresholds : ( 1 ) the thresholds starting with the real energies ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) for decaying into two clusters ( two - body threshold ) , three clusters ( three - body threshold ) , and so on ; and ( 2 ) the thresholds with complex energies ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) for decaying into resonating clusters .",
    "all branch cuts are rotated with the same angle by using the common scaling angle @xmath6 for every coordinate and conjugate momentum of the system .",
    "this feature of the csm enables the decomposition of the various non - resonant continuum states from the degenerated states with a non - scaled hamiltonian @xmath12 .",
    "the decomposition of the states brings unique identification of all types of continuum states on the @xmath24-rotated lines , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_abc ] .",

    "the csm application has numerous in nuclear cluster physics .",
    "the @xmath25 cluster states often exist just near the @xmath25 particle threshold and some of them can be resonances .",

    "most of the halo nuclei have only one bound state with a halo structure , and so , the excitation of the nuclei requires the study of unbound states beyond the two - body cases .",
    "multi - neutron resonances with a core should be treated to clarify their specific properties such as configuration , responses , and coupling with continuum states . in proton - rich nuclei ,",
    "the coulomb repulsion produces a repulsive effect in the energies , and then , the number of resonances is generally larger than that in the neutron - rich cases @xcite . the csm is applied to examine the many - body resonance phenomena in neutron / proton - rich nuclei . in this article",
    ", we show the example of he isotopes of @xmath33he and their mirror nuclei of @xmath34li , @xmath1be , @xmath35b , and @xmath36c .",

    "we employ the cluster - orbital shell model ( cosm ) approach @xcite to construct the many - body basis function .",

    "the main aim of this review is to demonstrate the recent development of the complex scaling method ( csm ) and its application to the descriptions of nuclear resonance and continuum states . in unstable nuclei ,",
    "most of the states are observed as unbound states due to the weak binding nature of the extra nucleons .",
    "this situation demands a reliable theory for describing resonances satisfying the multi - particle decay condition .",
    "the csm is a powerful method for this purpose and can be easily applied to various nuclear models .",
    "we have often applied the csm to the nuclear cluster model , because the relative motions between constituents are essential to generate resonances and can be solved accurately in the cluster model .",
    "we have analyzed spectroscopy of the unstable nuclei on the basis of the cluster orbital shell model ( cosm ) consisting of core + nucleons with complex scaling , i.e. the cs - cosm . using the cs - cosm ,",
    "we have presented the results of the many - body resonances appearing in light neutron - rich / proton - rich nuclei , including the predictions .",
    "we have discussed the structure of resonances , such as single particle configurations and radius as well as energy eigenvalues .",
    "this novel analysis of resonances is the advantage of the csm because it enables to define the matrix elements of resonances like those of the bound states .",
    "the further theoretical development to treat the many - body unbound states of nuclei on the basis of the shell model type approach would be desired .",
    "we have also shown the reliability of the complex - scaled green s function , which enables us to calculate the various strength functions of electric responses , spectroscopic factors , and so on .",
    "green s function includes all kinds of information on not only resonances but also the non - resonant continuum states , both of which contribute to the scattering observables .",
    "using green s function , we can precisely extract the resonance contribution from the total strength .",
    "this analysis clarifies the physical role of resonances in the observables .",
    "we have also shown the application of the csm to the calculation of the continuum level density , which is directly connected to the scattering solutions like the phase shifts .",
    "we have discussed the role of resonance poles on the phase shifts in the two - body case .",
    "the breakup reaction is an important phenomenon occurring in the unstable nuclei .",
    "two - neutron halo nuclei can be easily broken into three - body states owing to the small separation energy of extra neutrons in the ground states .",
    "we have shown the coulomb breakup strengths of two halo nuclei , @xmath1he and @xmath2li , into core+@xmath32+@xmath32 final states . for @xmath2li",
    ", we extended the theory to include the tensor and pairing correlations in the @xmath215li core .",
    "these correlations are important to explain the halo formation in @xmath2li with a large amount of @xmath256-wave neutrons and are treated in terms of the tensor - optimized shell model with the multi - configuration of the @xmath215li core . as a result , the breakup strengths into the three - body scattering states are nicely described in the csm .",
    "this analysis enables us to examine the structure of halo nuclei in the many - body scattering states beyond the thresholds .    in the dynamics of three - body breakup reactions , it is useful to understand the correlations between constituents . for this purpose ,",
    "we have developed the method of complex - scaled solutions of the lippmann - schwinger equation . by solving the three - body lippmann - schwinger equation with the csm ,",
    "we can obtain three - body scattering solutions .",
    "we suitably extract the invariant mass spectra of any subsystems in the three - body breakup and examine the effect of binary resonances on the breakup process .",
    "recently , the continuum - discretized coupled channel method has been developed to use with the csm , and the energy distribution of the @xmath39-matrix can now be obtained .",
    "the csm is expected to bring the unified description of the structures and reactions of nuclei .",
    "several theories have put forth the ab - initio description of resonances developed from the bare nucleon - nucleon interaction , such as few - body method @xcite and the no - core shell model approach @xcite . further extension to the many - body resonant and continuum states covering the wide range of mass numbers is the current task in this direction .",
    "the csm describes resonances with complex energy eigenvalues , the imaginary part of which represents the total decay width .",
    "it is important to evaluate the partial decay widths of resonances for each decaying channel , which provide useful information on decay properties of the resonances .",
    "however , the theoretical foundation for describing the partial decay widths in the csm has not yet been achieved .",
    "it is desirable to develop a method for extracting the partial decay widths of the resonances in the csm .",
    "there is a theoretical development of obtaining the partial decay widths by using the continuity equation based on the time - dependent schrdinger equation @xcite .    in the theory of resonances ,",
    "the matrix elements of the resonances are generally defined as complex values and easily obtained by using the csm as well as eigenenergies .",
    "the complex matrix elements of resonances exhibit useful information on the structure of resonance , but simultaneously result in the problem of the physical interpretation , which is not solved yet .",
    "in addition to the resonances , the virtual states are a kind of unbound states , which often play an important role in nuclear structure . the halo structure of @xmath2li",
    "is closely related to the presence of the virtual @xmath256-wave states in @xmath261li near the @xmath215li+@xmath32 threshold energy . at present , it is not possible to obtain the virtual states directly in the csm , different from resonance poles .",
    "there are several methods of obtaining the virtual states such as the jost function method @xcite , which , however , is limited to the two - body case .",
    "it is desirable to develop a theoretical framework that can treat virtual states in the many - body case .",
