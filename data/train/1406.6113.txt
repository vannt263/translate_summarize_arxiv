    "in the first part of this supplemental material we discuss in depth the derivation of the low energy action presented in the main text . we discuss the various terms arising in the low energy model and their physical meaning .",
    "we proceed by considering an alternative derivation of the low energy model based on a gauge field theoretical approach .",
    "this offers additional insights on the emerging symmetries of the theory .    in the second part of this supplemental material",
    "we give a detailed derivation of the bosonization results presented in the main text . in order to give a better intuition of the material presented in this section , we draw various parallels with the well known one dimensional case of a luttiger liquid .",
    "in this section we give a complete derivation of the low energy model of interacting graphene starting from the lattice theory .",
    "although the derivation of the non - interacting model can be easily found in the literature ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive introduction ) , here we reconsider it for completeness and for highlighting some important steps .",
    "the analysis of the interaction term is not usually presented in the literature .",
    "the concept of low energy effective theories is paramount in modern theoretical physics , and in its current form dates back to the introduction by wilson  @xcite of renormalization group ideas .",
    "the main idea behind the effective field theory approach is that physics at different energy scales is governed by a restricted , relevant number of degrees of freedom . by progressively discarding high energy degrees of freedom ,",
    "we can arrive at simpler theories capturing the long wavelength and low energy degrees of freedom of otherwise complicated theories . in condensed matter physics ,",
    "one usually needs to deal with complicated band structures ; it is therefore remarkable that such complicated theories are often reduced at low energies to known field theories presenting a certain number of symmetries .",
    "these symmetries can be inherited from the underlying lattice or are sometimes due to the continuum approximation . in the latter case ,",
    "particular care must be taken in order to obtain meaningful results .",
    "the same is true for certain kind of anomalies that appear in the continuum model but are absent in the original lattice model , e.g. schwinger and chiral anomalies in effective theories described by dirac electrons  @xcite .",
    "a well studied example of theories where these anomalies play a major role are @xmath99 theories of dirac electrons . for the space time dimensions while @xmath100 is used for the space dimension only . ]     and @xmath101 .",
    "the two triangular sub lattices are shown for the @xmath102 ( dashed ) and the @xmath101 ( dashed dotted ) lattice sites . here",
    "@xmath103 is the lattice ( constant ) spacing and @xmath104 , @xmath105 are the two lattice vectors . ]",
    "coming back to graphene , we start defining the lattice model in terms of a tight binding hamiltonian .",
    "carbon atoms in graphene arrange themselves in a honeycomb structure comprising of two triangular bravais sublattices , identifying two sets @xmath102 and @xmath101 of inequivalent points , see fig .. the lattice structure is defined by specifying the lattice basis vectors @xmath106 } = n_1 \\ , \\mathbf{c}_1 +   n_2 \\ , \\mathbf{c}_2 $ ] , where @xmath107 and @xmath103 is the lattice spacing .",
    "we define interacting electrons on the honeycomb structure with a hubbard like hamiltonian with nearest neighbour ( nn ) hopping and a long range coulomb interaction .",
    "physically this corresponds to considering the electrons to be constrained on the lattice while the photons can move in the continuum .",
    "note that this is different from a true lattice gauge theory , where the photons are also constrained on the lattice .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath108 , where @xmath109   + \\ , v(\\mathbf{r}_{nm}-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1 ) \\left [ \\rho_{a , n } \\rho_{b , m+\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1}+ \\rho_{a , n+\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1 }   \\rho_{b , m } \\right ] \\right\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath110 is the hopping parameter and @xmath111 and @xmath112 are the nn vectors .",
    "the two ladder operators @xmath113 and @xmath114 operates respectively on sublattice @xmath102 and @xmath101 and @xmath115 are the density operators respectively .",
    "we have also defined @xmath116 and @xmath117 as the interaction potential . in @xmath118",
    "the first two terms describe interactions between electrons belonging to the same sublattice , while the last term describes interactions between electrons sitting on two different sublattice sites .",
    "we consider first the non interacting part of the hamiltonian defined in eq .. the momentum space representation of the ladder operators reads @xmath119 where @xmath120 in a system with periodic boundary conditions . using the above fourier decomposition , @xmath121 reads @xmath122 the three link vectors @xmath111 and @xmath112 are shown in fig.(1 ) of the main text .",
    "the energy dispersion of the non interacting system is easily found as : @xmath123 + 2 \\cos\\left [ \\mathbf{p } \\cdot ( \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_1-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3)\\right ] + 2 \\cos \\left [ \\mathbf{p } \\cdot ( \\boldsymbol{\\delta}_2-\\boldsymbol{\\delta}_3 ) \\right ]   } \\\\ \\label{eq : gsen1 } & = & \\pm t \\sqrt{3 + 4 \\cos \\left ( p_x \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2 } l \\right ) \\cos \\left ( p_y \\frac{3}{2 }   l \\right)+ 2 \\cos \\left ( p_x \\sqrt{3 } l \\right)}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the energy spectrum vanishes linearly at the corner of the brillouin zone in three pairs of points called the dirac points .",
    "choosing for example @xmath124 , the energy vanishes for @xmath125 the first couple of zeros is then @xmath126 .",
    "we can focus just on the couple of points above , since the description of the remaining ones is completely equivalent .",
    "the spectrum of the theory contains therefore two isolated zeros .",
    "since the fermi surface shrinks to zero at the two dirac points , it is possible to globally linearise the hamiltonian in the neighbourhood of @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the linearisation procedure affects both the spectrum and the operators of the hamiltonian , and should always be accompanied by the definition of a ( high energy ) cutoff @xmath7 ( @xmath129 ) specifying the energy ( momentum ) window where the effective theory faithfully describes the original system .",
    "looking at the energy spectrum of @xmath130 close to one of the dirac points , one notices that the spectrum is actually asymmetric in the @xmath131 direction .",
    "for example , in the @xmath132 direction the band curvature is more pronounced than in the @xmath133 direction , therefore two different cutoffs should be chosen . to avoid this complication",
    ", we consider low enough energies for which a linear spectrum indeed constitutes a good approximation ( this also corresponds to the energy regime often probed in experiments ) .",
    "let us consider eq.([eq : gsen1 ] ) first ; the wave vectors @xmath132 and @xmath133 can be expanded for small deviations around the two dirac points : @xmath134 , @xmath135 . from dimensional analysis , being @xmath136= { \\rm length}$ ] and @xmath137= { \\rm energy}$ ] , multiplying and dividing by @xmath86 , @xmath138= \\hslash \\ , [ { \\rm velocity}]$ ] .",
    "so we can identify @xmath139 as the bare ( i.e. related to the non - interacting system ) velocity of the propagating modes .",
    "moreover , by noticing that @xmath140 defines the ground state energy , one arrives to @xmath141 that is a linear dispersion relation of slope @xmath0 with a true zero energy vacuum state ( the @xmath142 drops out of the expression ) .",
    "the low energy theory is therefore a well defined quantum field theory .",
    "we proceed next by deriving the low energy expression for @xmath143 .",
    "first we need to define new operators creating electronic excitations close to the two dirac points .",
    "it is useful to introduce the notation @xmath144 . in eq .",
    "we have defined the fourier decomposition of an electron ladder operator acting on sub lattice a ( b ) by creating or destroying a real electron .",
    "the first step in defining the low energy theory is to restrict the momentum sum in the momentum window @xmath145 $ ] .",
    "then we use the decomposition @xmath146 to obtain @xmath147 where we have defined the operators destroying electronic excitations close to the @xmath148 points as @xmath149 , being @xmath16 the number of sites in the system . in some graphene literature , the @xmath150 index is called the  valley \" index , however throughout this work we will adopt a different view and call @xmath150 the chirality index for reasons that will be evident soon .",
    "let us pause for a moment and think about the meaning of eq .",
    ": while @xmath113 is an operator creating an electron at point @xmath151 in the original lattice theory , @xmath152 creates excitations of momentum @xmath153 ; as long as we are interested in the large scale behaviour of the system , this picture is well defined because the relevant physics takes place in the vicinity of the two dirac points .",
    "mathematically , the new ladder operators @xmath154(@xmath155 ) may be considered as smooth functions on the scale @xmath156  @xcite .",
    "however , we need to keep in mind that a real electron is always made of both types of excitations .",

    "we arrive at @xmath166 where now momentum is measured with respect to @xmath167 .",
    "it is convenient at this point to take the continuum limit by exchanging the sum over discrete momenta for an integral over two dimensional momentum @xmath168 the last step consists in defining the chiral spinor fields as @xmath169 together with the three pauli matrices @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 .",
    "the sub lattice operators enter in eq .   as spinor degrees of freedom .",
    "if we interpret the sub lattice degrees of freedom as a pseudo spin , we see that the two chiral fields are rotated one with respect to the other . in this representation",
    "the free piece of the hamiltonian reads : @xmath173 this is the momentum space representation of a two dimensional dirac hamiltonian in the chiral basis .",
    "we will analyse eq .   in detail in the next section , however here we would like to remark that the chiral form of @xmath130 is due to the decomposition of the ladder operators performed in eq .",
    "[ eq : loweoperator ] .",

    "also for the low energy transferred momentum . ] like in the @xmath83 case , the construction described here leads to a theory valid for small momentum transfer ; however , this does not mean that the theory is only valid for weak interactions , as pointed out by haldane in the @xmath83 case  @xcite .",

    "we can write the total interacting hamiltonian as : @xmath201 to make connection with the gauge theoretical approach of the next section , we finally write the real space action corresponding to the total low energy effective hamiltonian : @xmath202      in this section we show that the off diagonal density interaction terms found in the previous section naturally appear from the continuum , non interacting model using the gauge principle .",
    "indeed this was one of the original approaches to the study of electron correlations in graphene and was first considered by gonzlez et al . in ref .",
    "@xcite . in their approach , the authors obtain a chiral theory of interacting graphene , i.e. without the off diagonal interaction terms . in order to show the source of the discordance , we start from the non - interacting , continuum model described by eq.([eq : hchiral ] ) and highlights its symmetries . building on ref .",
    "@xcite , we show how the gauge principle can be used together with dimensional reduction to give the correct result .",
    "we will finally support our result with some general considerations on the difference between chiral and non chiral fermionic models .",

    "it is easy to check that @xmath222 is invariant under a global @xmath45 transformation @xmath223 , with @xmath224 an angular parameter .",
    "the lagrangian is also invariant with respect to a chiral transformation , i.e. a rotation of the spinor @xmath217 in the @xmath225 space implemented by : @xmath226 . to see this",
    ", one has to make use of the anti - commutation property of the gamma matrices @xmath227 , from which it also follows that @xmath228 .",
    "according to noether s theorem , every continuum symmetry of @xmath222 corresponds to a conserved current . in the case of the @xmath45 gauge symmetry ,",
    "the electromagnetic current @xmath229 is conserved , while in the case of the chiral symmetry , the chiral current @xmath230 is conserved .",
    "physically , the global chiral invariance discussed above corresponds to the arbitrariness in labelling the @xmath225 states , so that exchanging this labelling will not change the physics . as it is well known , a mass term breaks the global chiral invariance since @xmath231 .",
    "if @xmath232 in a specific phase , i.e. if it acquires a vacuum expectation value , then we say that the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "this mechanism , familiar in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) where it leads to the breakdown of the @xmath233 chiral symmetry between left and right quarks , has also been proposed in graphene  @xcite .",
    "note that this way of breaking the chiral symmetry , and therefore introducing a mass gap , is essentially classical .",
    "there is in fact another way of introducing a violation of the chiral symmetry that does not involve symmetry breaking nor the appearance of a gap in the spectrum and it is the quantum anomaly  @xcite .",
    "we would like to use the gauge principle to determine the interactions in the effective theory of graphene directly from @xmath222 .",
    "however , if we use the gauge principle as it is in 3-d space time , we will obtain electrons interacting through a @xmath234-type interaction .",
    "the point is that the system we are working with is not a truly 3-d one .",
    "as emphasised in the main text , we are considering a system of electrons confined in the two spatial dimensions of the graphene layer but interacting through photons that are free to propagate in the third space dimension , see fig .  .",
    "however , since the photons themselves originate from the electrons , their dynamics is constrained to the electron s dynamics .",
    "were we considering a truly 2-d system , under a local gauge transformation the fermionic fields would transform as @xmath235 , @xmath236 .",
    "so there is no way we will obtain a photon propagating in the third spatial dimension in this way .",
    "the correct way to analyse this system is within the context of dimensional reduction  @xcite as we are now going to explain .",
    "first of all we should start thinking about the fermionic fields as not living strictly in 2-d , but instead as a 3-d field constrained to 2-d . in condensed matter physics",
    "there are many examples of systems supporting this picture . in a heterostructure for example , a scalar potential along the ( say ) @xmath237 direction confines the electron s wave function @xmath238 along @xmath237 . in the absence of other interactions the following ansatz",
    "is used  @xcite @xmath239 where @xmath217 is taken in the plane wave basis .",
    "the function @xmath240 is the solution of the potential - well problem . at low temperature and for not too high electron densities",
    "the fermi energy can be at the lowest level ( i.e. @xmath241 ) such that higher energy bands do not play a significant role and the system dynamics can be considered 2-d .",
    "when obtaining graphene , we physically decouple the 2-d sheet from the 3-d structure of graphite .",
    "so we may think about this situation as that of having an infinitely strong confinement potential along the @xmath242 direction .",
    "guided by this picture , we employ the following ansatz of the 4-d electron field : @xmath243 .",
    "then , under a local gauge transformation @xmath244 it is now convenient to introduce the following notation for the indices : @xmath245 and @xmath246 . an action equivalent to the one in eq .",

    "is a gauge fixing term and can be obtained using the fadeev - popov method  @xcite .",
    "finally , we want to rewrite the gauged fermionic action in terms of the fermionic currents as @xmath257 in this way we obtain an action for fermions moving in a 3-d space time but electromagnetically interacting via photons living in a 4-d space time . introducing the current @xmath258",

    "<S> recent experiments reveal a significant increase in the graphene fermi velocity close to charge neutrality . this has widely been interpreted as a confirmation of the logarithmic divergence of the graphene fermi velocity predicted by a perturbative approach . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we reconsider this problem using functional bosonization techniques calculating the effects of electron interactions on the density of states non - perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the renormalized velocity is _ finite _ and independent of the high energy cut - off , and we argue that the experimental observations are better understood in terms of an anomalous dimension . </S>",
    "<S> our results also represent a bosonized solution for interacting weyl fermions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions at half - filing .    </S>",
    "<S> it is generally believed that electron - electron interactions play only a small role in the electronic properties of graphene . since interaction effects </S>",
    "<S> are weak , most experimental observations away from charge neutrality can be understood within the quasi - particle framework of fermi liquid theory ( fl ) . </S>",
    "<S> there is a simple argument for why interaction effects are small in graphene . for dirac systems , </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic energy and coulomb potential energy have the same scaling with carrier density . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the effective strength of the interactions is density independent and depends only on the fermi velocity @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is customary  @xcite to define a dimensionless parameter @xmath1 ) to parametrize the strength of electron interactions , and using the non - interacting value of @xmath0 calculated from _ ab initio _ methods gives @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> several approaches , but most notably those that combine confined rpa and quantum monte carlo  @xcite conclude that this value of @xmath3 is much too small to observe signatures of a correlated ground state such as the opening of a mott gap . moreover , graphene is often on a substrate , and this further reduces the effect of interactions  @xcite . for the most common situation of graphene on silicon dioxide or on boron nitride , we have @xmath4 .    </S>",
    "<S> still , at charge neutrality there are other reasons to expect that the effect of interactions in graphene will be strong . calculating the self - energy to leading order in interaction strength , gonzales et al </S>",
    "<S> . found that there is an interaction correction to the fermi velocity  @xcite @xmath5 .   </S>",
    "<S> \\label{eq : gonzales}\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath6 is the `` renormalized '' fermi velocity , @xmath7 is a high - energy cut - off , which for graphene ( up to a factor ) is typically taken to be the energy where the bands cease to be linear i.e. @xmath8 ( for lattice spacing @xmath9 ) and @xmath10 is the energy . away from charge neutrality </S>",
    "<S> , it is also common in the literature to replace ( up to finite terms ) @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the fermi energy ) even though eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is strictly only valid at charge neutrality . </S>",
    "<S> the application of this result to finite chemical potential is then justified because the difference between expanding about @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be calculated perturbatively and is non - divergent ( for details we refer the reader to calculations done within the random phase approximation framework  @xcite or within a renormalization group framework  @xcite ) .    the important observation from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> is that at charge neutrality  _ for any value of the interactions _  the renormalized fermi velocity diverges , the quasi - particle propagator becomes non - analytic and the system has a non - fermi liquid ground state  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , even for very weak interactions @xmath15 , correlation physics dominates close to charge neutrality and the ground state is not a fermi liquid . </S>",
    "<S> it should be obvious that eq .   </S>",
    "<S> should be understood as a perturbative result ( either in small @xmath3 or in a large @xmath16 expansion ) . yet , this result has been used to explain a factor of 3 enhancement of the fermi velocity observed experimentally  @xcite or to argue theoretically that graphene electrons at charge neutrality approach the speed of light  @xcite . with the breakdown of perturbation theory close to the dirac point , what is required to understand the experimental observations is a non - perturbative solution for interacting weyl fermions in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions .    in this letter , we present a functional bosonization solution for dirac fermions at charge neutrality interacting through a coulomb interaction . we explicitly calculate the interacting density of states ( dos ) and find that it is no longer linear in energy . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the dos scales as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the anomalous dimension that depends only on @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> acquiring an anomalous dimension is to be expected for critical systems  @xcite , and was anticipated for 2d dirac fermions by several authors  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our non - perturbative calculation for the anomalous dimension for the interacting dos is directly relevant to the experimental studies on interacting graphene which we now discuss briefly .    </S>",
    "<S> the enhancement of the fermi velocity close to charge neutrality has been observed in infra - red spectroscopy  @xcite , scanning tunnelling spectroscopy ( stm )  @xcite , photoemission  @xcite , magnetotransport @xcite and capacitance measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> at least for the magnetotransport , stm and capacitance measurements , the experimental quantity actually being measured is related to the interacting density of states . in these works , by ignoring the interaction induced anomalous dimension , and by fixing the density of states to be linear in energy , the energy - dependent `` effective velocity '' ( which we call @xmath19 in our analysis below ) acquires a logarithmic divergence in both energy and cut - off . </S>",
    "<S> however , our theoretical analysis shows that once the anomalous dimension is taken into account , the velocity becomes finite and both energy and cut - off independent . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we predict that measurements done at charge neutrality will not have a divergent fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we note that ref .  @xcite reported data for an electron puddle and for a hole puddle , but with the same set - up could have measured graphene at charge neutrality , which is the experimental situation that most closely corresponds to the bosonization results presented here .    </S>",
    "<S> bosonization has been successfully used to describe interacting systems in @xmath20 where the quasi - particle pictures breaks down and a new strongly correlated state of matter emerges : a luttinger liquid ( ll )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in spatial dimensions @xmath21 , systems interacting with singular interactions have been extensively studied in the past  @xcite and shown to support non fermi liquid behaviour . </S>",
    "<S> as emphasised by many authors ( including ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , in these systems an approach that does not rely on the intermediate assumption of fermi liquid behaviour is desirable . </S>",
    "<S> higher dimensional bosonization has been developed in different forms by many authors  @xcite . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the formulation of kopietz et al .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , who generalised to higher dimensions the work of lee and chen  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this approach to bosonization is closer in spirit to the conventional one used in condensed matter systems and it is deeply connected to the field theoretic approach to critical phenomena .    </S>",
    "<S> the key idea of bosonization in a condensed matter system ( in any dimension ) is that it is possible to describe the low energy sector of an interacting fermionic system in terms of an equivalent system of  non interacting \" bosons . </S>",
    "<S> then , by relating the fermionic and the bosonic representations , it is possible to obtain the correlation functions of the original fermionic system non perturbatively </S>",
    "<S> . in one spatial dimension , the fermi surface ( fs ) is zero dimensional and it is therefore possible to obtain a low energy description by linearising about the two fermi points . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure defines _ two fermionic _ fields , often called the right / left chiral fields . </S>",
    "<S> the linear theory is successively bosonized in terms of _ two bosonic _ fields , one for each of the original fermionic fields . in @xmath21 , due to the finite extent of the fs , it is generally not possible to linearise the spectrum globally , and the curvature of the fs therefore plays an essential role  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the bosonization approach to systems having a finite fermi surface has been discussed e.g. in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this usually involves the subdivision of the fs into patches , each patch identifying a subset of @xmath22 dimensional _ fermionic _ field theories that are subsequently bosonized . </S>",
    "<S> it is the curvature of the fs that spoils the exact solution of the model  @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the problem of bosonizing a theory with a finite fs lies essentially in the lack of a globally defined low energy _ fermionic _ </S>",
    "<S> field theory .    </S>",
    "<S> the central idea of this work is that for graphene at charge neutrality , there are indeed two isolated dirac points where the fermi surface is zero dimensional . </S>",
    "<S> the low energy fermionic theory is obtained by linearising the original lattice hamiltonian about the _ two _ dirac points without requiring any patching . in  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we rederive the low energy theory of graphene including the coulomb interaction at the lattice level . </S>",
    "<S> the theory is described by the imaginary time action @xmath23@xmath24 where @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 is inverse temperature in units of @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the chirality index . </S>",
    "<S> we have also introduced the set of pauli matrices @xmath29 , the bare fermi velocity @xmath0 and the spinor representation @xmath30 , @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> ( throughout this work einstein s summation convention applies for repeated indices ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 are the matrix elements of the coulomb interaction describing two kinds of forward scattering events : one ( called @xmath33 ) with the same chiral indices , taking place separately in the two dirac cones , and the other ( called @xmath34 ) with different indices connecting the two cones . </S>",
    "<S> both terms get most of the contribution from transferred momentum @xmath35 and preserve the chiral symmetry of the action . </S>",
    "<S> equation   can also be obtained directly from the continuum model within a gauge theory approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> next we outline the main steps in the functional bosonization program  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the partition function is given by @xmath36 e^{-s[\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\eta } , \\psi_{\\eta } ] } , \\ ] ] where @xmath37 are independent grassman fields . </S>",
    "<S> in the operator approach to bosonization , one of the central steps of the procedure consists of realizing that the density field @xmath38 has a bosonic character . </S>",
    "<S> being completely general , this observation can be implemented in the functional formalism by introducing a functional dirac delta function @xmath39=c \\int \\mathscr{d}\\phi_{\\eta } \\ , exp\\left\\{-\\imath \\int \\phi_{\\eta } \\,(\\rho_{\\eta}-\\psi^{\\dagger}_{\\eta}\\psi_{\\eta})\\right\\ } </S>",

    "<S> usually works with the density field and integrate out the @xmath40 fields ; using the conservation of the topological current , the density field is then expressed as @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath44 is an additional phase field satisfying ( in the case of abelian bosonization ) a chiral @xmath45 kac - moody algebra  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> fermionic vertex fields are then obtained in terms of @xmath44 as @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the generalisation of the vertex representation to @xmath21 turns out to be problematic , and although several proposal exist  @xcite , there is no general agreement on its form . to avoid this problem , </S>",
    "<S> here we work in the dual representation @xmath47 since it allows to evaluate the fermionic green s functions without the explicit knowledge of the vertex representation . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath47 field is a two component spinor encoding the collective degrees of freedom of the system and is analogous to the field used to study critical phenomenas  @xcite . in order to obtain an effective theory solely in terms of the @xmath47 field </S>",

    "<S> on the other hand , @xmath51 formally contains all possible interactions between the fermions and the background field @xmath47 in terms of closed loop diagrams . </S>",
    "<S> we note that by rescaling @xmath40 by the coupling strength and introducing an @xmath16 component field , eq . can also be interpreted as the starting point of a large @xmath16 expansion  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our case , the next step consists of showing that only the @xmath52 loop in @xmath51 is non - zero , and that the resulting bosonic effective theory is gaussian . </S>",
