    "in four dimensions , the einstein tensor is the only conserved symmetric tensor that depends on the metric and its derivatives up to second order . however for spacetimes possessing more than four dimensions , as assumed in both string theory and brane world cosmology ,",
    "this is not the case . in string theory ,",
    "extra dimensions are a theoretical necessity since superstring theory requires a ten - dimensional spacetime to be consistent from the quantum point of view , while in brane world cosmology matter and gauge interactions are localized on a 3-brane , embedded into a higher dimensional spacetime in which gravity propagates throughout the whole of spacetime .",
    "the most natural extension of general relativity in higher dimensional spacetimes with the assumption of einstein  that the left hand side of the field equations is the most general symmetric conserved tensor containing no more than two derivatives of the metric  is lovelock theory .",
    "lovelock @xcite found the most general symmetric conserved tensor satisfying this property .",
    "the resultant tensor is nonlinear in the riemann tensor and differs from the einstein tensor only if the spacetime has more than 4 dimensions .",
    "since the lovelock tensor contains metric derivatives no higher second order , the quantization of the linearized lovelock theory is ghost - free @xcite .",
    "the concepts of action and energy - momentum play central roles in gravity .",
    "however there is no good local notion of energy for a gravitating system .",
    "quasilocal definitions of energy and conserved quantities for einstein gravity @xcite define a stress energy tensor on the boundary of some region within the spacetime through the use of the well - defined gravitational action of einstein gravity with the surface term of gibbons and hawking @xcite .",
    "our first aim in this paper is to generalize the definition of the quasilocal stress energy tensor for computing the conserved quantities of a solution of third order lovelock gravity with zero curvature boundary .",
    "the first step is to find the surface terms for the action of third order lovelock gravity that make the action well - defined .",
    "these surface terms were introduced by myers in terms of differential forms @xcite .",
    "the explicit form of the surface terms for second order lovelock gravity has been written in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we write down the tensorial form of the surface term for the third order lovelock gravity , and then obtain the stress energy tensor via the quasilocal formalism .",
    "of course , as in the case of einstein gravity , the action and conserved quantities diverge when the boundary goes to infinity .",
    "we will also introduce a counterterm to deal with these divergences .",
    "this is quite straightforward for the cases we consider in which the boundary is flat .",
    "this is because all curvature invariants are zero except for a constant , and so the only possible boundary counterterm is one proportional to the volume of the boundary regardless of the number of dimensions .",
    "the coefficient of this volume counterterm is the same for solutions with flat or curved boundary .",
    "the issue of determination of boundary counterterms with their coefficients for higher - order lovelock theories is at this point an open question .",
    "since the lovelock lagrangian appears in the low energy limit of string theory , there has in recent years been a renewed interest in lovelock gravity .",
    "in particular , exact static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of the gauss - bonnet gravity ( quadratic in the riemann tensor ) have been found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and of the maxwell - gauss - bonnet and born - infeld - gauss - bonnet models in ref .",
    "the thermodynamics of the uncharged static spherically black hole solutions has been considered in @xcite , of solutions with nontrivial topology and asymptotically de sitter in @xcite and of charged solutions in @xcite .",
    "very recently nut charged black hole solutions of gauss - bonnet gravity and gauss - bonnet - maxwell gravity were obtained @xcite .",
    "all of these known solutions in gauss - bonnet gravity are static .",
    "not long ago one of us introduced two new classes of rotating solutions of second order lovelock gravity and investigated their thermodynamics @xcite , and made the first attempt for finding exact solutions in third order lovelock gravity with the quartic terms @xcite .",

    ", it is of general interest to explore black holes in generalized gravity theories in order to discover which properties are peculiar to einstein s gravity , and which are robust features of all generally covariant theories of gravity .",

    "we also perform a local stability analysis of the black holes in the canonical and grand canonical ensembles .",
    "we finish our paper with some concluding remarks .",
    "the action of third order lovelock gravity in the presence of electromagnetic field may be written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cosmological constant , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are gauss - bonnet and third order lovelock coefficients , @xmath8 is electromagnetic tensor field and @xmath9 is the vector potential .",

    "( [ act1 ] ) is an euler density in six dimensions and has no contribution to the field equations in six or less dimensional spacetimes , we therefore consider @xmath3-dimensional spacetimes with @xmath13 .",

    "these normal derivative terms do not vanish by themselves , but are canceled by the variation of the gibbons - hawking surface term @xcite @xmath25 the main difference between higher derivative gravity and einstein gravity is that the surface term that renders the variational principle well - behaved is much more complicated .",

    "one way of eliminating these divergences is through the use of background subtraction @xcite , in which the boundary surface is embedded in another ( background ) spacetime , and all quasilocal quantities are computed with respect to this background , incorporated into the theory by adding to the action the extrinsic curvature of the embedded surface .",
    "such a procedure causes the resulting physical quantities to depend on the choice of reference background ; furthermore , it is not possible in general to embed the boundary surface into a background spacetime . for asymptotically ads solutions , one can instead deal with these divergences via the counterterm method inspired by ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "this conjecture , which relates the low energy limit of string theory in asymptotically anti de - sitter spacetime and the quantum field theory on its boundary , has attracted a great deal of attention in recent years .",
    "the equivalence between the two formulations means that , at least in principle , one can obtain complete information on one side of the duality by performing computation on the other side .",
    "a dictionary translating between different quantities in the bulk gravity theory and their counterparts on the boundary has emerged , including the partition functions of both theories . in the present context",
    "this conjecture furnishes a means for calculating the action and conserved quantities intrinsically without reliance on any reference spacetime @xcite by adding additional terms on the boundary that are curvature invariants of the induced metric .",
    "although there may exist a very large number of possible invariants one could add in a given dimension , only a finite number of them are nonvanishing as the boundary is taken to infinity .",
    "its many applications include computations of conserved quantities for black holes with rotation , nut charge , various topologies , rotating black strings with zero curvature horizons and rotating higher genus black branes @xcite .",
    "although the counterterm method applies for the case of a specially infinite boundary , it was also employed for the computation of the conserved and thermodynamic quantities in the case of a finite boundary @xcite .",
    "extensions to de sitter spacetime and asymptotically flat spacetimes have also been proposed @xcite .",
    "all of the work mentioned in the previous paragraph was limited to einstein gravity . here",
    "we apply the counterterm method to the case of the solutions of the field equations of third order lovelock gravity . at any given dimension",
    "there are only finitely many counterterms that one can write down that do not vanish at infinity .",
    "this does not depend upon what the bulk theory is  i.e. whether or not it is einstein , gauss - bonnet , 3rd order lovelock , etc .",
    "indeed , for asymptotically ( a)ds solutions , the boundary counterterms that cancel divergences in einstein gravity should also cancel divergences in 2nd and 3rd order lovelock gravity",
    ". the coefficients will be different and depends on @xmath5  and lovelock coefficients as we will see this for the volume term in the flat boundary case below .",
    "of course these coefficients should reduce to those in einstein gravity as one may expect . unfortunately we do not have a rotating solution to either gauss - bonnet or 3rd - order lovelock gravity that does not have a flat boundary at infinity .",
