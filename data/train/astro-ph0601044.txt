    "it is still unclear what drives the universe into acceleration recently .",
    "while a cosmological constant @xmath0 is the simplest explanation , its value seems completely at odd with the naive estimate of the vacuum energy due to quantum effects .",
    "an alternative to @xmath0 is obtained considering a dynamical degree of freedom added to the primordial soup . since dynamical dark energy ( dde )",
    "varies in time and space , its fluctuations are potentially important in order to distinguish it from @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "another possibility for the explanation of the present acceleration of the universe is given by the geometry itself , through a modification of einstein gravity at large distances @xcite : these are known as geometric dark energy ( gde ) models .",
    "a non vanishing mass for the graviton is among these possibilities @xcite .",
    "_ cosmological _ observations , such as those coming from supernovae , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) anisotropies and large scale structure ( lss ) , have not been able to discriminate among dde models yet ( see @xcite for updated constraints and forecasts ) .",
    "it is therefore important to explore observational tests at _ astrophysical _",
    "level for objects which are detached from the cosmological expansion .",
    "we shall consider a sss metric in terms of the physical radius @xmath1 ds^2 = - b(r ) dt^2 + a(r ) dr^2 + r^2 d^2 .",
    "[ sss ] such a metric with b(r ) = a^-1 ( r ) = 1- 2 g m r - 3 r^2 , [ sds ] describes the schwarzschild - de sitter ( sds ) space - time , the vacuum solution of einstein equations in presence of a cosmological constant @xmath0 ( in @xmath2 units , where @xmath3 is the velocity of light ) . with the above metric",
    ", the classic general relativistic tests can be computed in analogy with the schwarzschild ( henceforth s ) textbook case @xcite .",
    "we shall restrict here to light bending , leaving other results for elsewhere @xcite .    [",
    "cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "we have discussed light bending in sss with de . the importance of general relativistic tests , such as the perihelion precession , has been already emphasized for the dgp model @xcite , while little attention was previously paid to light bending .",
    "these tests are complementary to the observational signatures of dark energy in cosmological context , mainly based on the behaviour of perturbations . in cosmology ,",
    "an important difference between @xmath0 and dde or gde is the presence of de perturbations in the latter case , which are at least gravitationally coupled to the other types of matter .",
    "such de perturbations are therefore a key point to distinguish @xmath0 from dde or gde in cmb and lss , and sometimes may become so important to strongly constrain models @xcite with respect to what supernovae data can do .",
    "in this article we have shown that in objects which have detached from the expansion of the universe , @xmath0 may be distinguishable from other de models through the bending of light . in order to link our findings with observations , we should insert @xmath4 in the lens equation , e.g. @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the angular positions of the image and of the source measured respect to the line from the observer to the lens ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the angular diameter distances between the lens and the source and between the observer and the source , respectively . on considering for simplicity alignment between the lens and the source , an einstein ring forms with angle @xmath10 . from our results , @xmath11 is affected by both the non - perturbative sss potential around the lens ( @xmath12 if de @xmath13 ) and the cosmology of a given model .",
    "the gde corrections to the einstein deflection angle for clusters in eq .",
    "( [ dephi ] ) are as important as the cosmology for an observable as @xmath11 .",
    "the differential of @xmath11 is = + , which reveals how cosmological information is encoded just in the second term to the right . by considering the cosmology of the dgp model for instance @xcite",
    ", one finds that the second term is @xmath14 for a source and a lens located at @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the present matter density and hubble parameter , respectively ) . on considering the uncertainties on the cosmological parameters of the order of percent ,",
    "this simple quantitative example shows how the corrections to the einstein deflection angle we have found in table i should be taken into account in the study of strong lensing by clusters .",
    "we believe that results similar to what we have found here for gde models , might occur for dde scenarios as well , in which the non - asymptotically flat term is due to the non - perturbative clumping of de into objects detached from the cosmological expansion .",
    "however , dde models may be less predictive than gde models : gde contain the same number of parameters of @xmath0cdm , while dde may need more .",
    "let us end on noting that some of the gde models considered here may have serious theoretical issues @xcite , whose resolution clearly go beyond the present project .",
    "however , the main result in eq .",
    "( [ dephi ] ) of this paper remains valid : models alternative to general relativity with a cosmological constant predict a correction to the einstein angle , which can be used to distinguish @xmath0 from other de models .",
