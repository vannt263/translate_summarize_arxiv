    "black holes have no `` hair '' is the classical statement which summarizes the physics behind stationary configurations describing the final state of highly massive matter under gravitational collapse . the `` no  hair '' conjecture stresses the fact that short  range interactions decaying fast enough at infinity ( `` hair '' ) , so that they have no contribution to gauss  like conserved charges , are not allowed in the exterior of a stationary black hole .",
    "hence , the black  hole classical degrees of freedom are restricted to those related to its conserved charges .",
    "the accuracy of this conjecture was challenged in the last decade when several `` hairy '' black hole solutions were discovered ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review and for the latest results see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "all these black holes shared together the feature of having nonlinear matter fields with no associated conserved charges .",
    "it is believed that the conjecture remains true without reserve for other nonlinear fields .",
    "for example , a particular case of the conjecture concerning merely scalar fields has been formulated by bekenstein and investigated by him and many other authors .",
    "the `` no  scalar  hair '' conjecture  @xcite asserts that for neutral scalar fields , nonminimally coupled to gravity , and with self  interaction potentials nontrivial black hole solutions are forbidden , i.e. , any stationary black hole solution of the system must has a trivial scalar field ( zero or constant ) and consequently the solution must be given by one of the well  known vacuum black holes ( schwarzschild or kerr ) .",
    "the aim of this work is to settle this conjecture for quartic self ",
    "interactions , i.e. , to exclude static black hole hairs in the framework of nonminimally coupled to gravity quartic self  interacting scalar fields .",
    "scalar fields with minimal coupling and a quartic self  interaction were earlier studied on the background of schwarzschild solution , exhibiting that only nonregular field configurations are allowed  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the present understanding of the topic excludes the existence of self  gravitating spherical scalar hairs with a general nonnegative self  interaction potential under minimal coupling  @xcite .",
    "comprising nonminimal couplings and nonnegative self  interactions , hairy spherical black holes are inadmissible for nonminimal coupling parameters in the ranges @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "other restrictions on the nonminimal couplings have been established also in @xmath3 dimensions  @xcite , and even for @xmath4gravity  @xcite .",
    "more recently , numerical evidence against the existence of nontrivial black hole solutions for each value of the nonminimal coupling spectrum under consideration has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this work",
    "we analyze nonminimally coupled to gravity scalar fields with quartic self  interactions .",
    "the motivation for choosing a quartic self  interaction rests on the following : for massless scalar fields , several works on the subject  @xcite reinforce the idea on the uniqueness of the nontrivial conformal bekenstein black hole  @xcite .",
    "independently of a recent controversial debate on the existence of this black hole as a conventional exact solution to einstein equations  @xcite , our view is that the oddities concerned with this solution may be due to the conformal invariance of the related model  actually , this solution was originally generated by a conformal transformation  @xcite . on the other hand , it is known that in four dimensions the relevant model remains conformally invariant under the inclusion of a quartic self  interaction .",
    "hence , we decide to explore if conformal invariance also implies in this new case a nontrivial behavior in the presence of static black holes .",
    "gravitation of these systems , including not only conformal coupling , is described by the action @xmath5 where @xmath6 stands for the scalar curvature , @xmath7 is the scalar field , @xmath0 is a parameter describing the nonminimal coupling between gravity and the scalar field , and @xmath8 is a self  coupling parameter characterizing the quartic self  interaction of the scalar field .",
    "we shall consider all the real values of the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath0 , on the other side the parameter @xmath8 is taken positive in order to the potential be nonnegative ; a required condition for ruled out scalar hairs in the minimal model ( @xmath9 )  @xcite .",
    "the `` no  scalar  hair '' theorem we attempt to establish in this work consists in demonstrating that for all values of the nonminimal coupling parameter @xmath0 , including the conformal one ( @xmath10 ) , any nontrivial behavior of the scalar field in presence of static asymptotically flat black holes is completely forbidden .",
    "that is , we shall study the scalar equation @xmath11 together with the einstein equations @xmath12 , \\label{eq : ein}\\ ] ] arising both from action ( [ eq : ac ] ) , not only in the case of the conformal coupling but for all the couplings permitted by the values of @xmath0 , and we shall show that a scalar field fulfilling the above equations must vanish in the domain of outer communications of a static black hole .    in a static black hole , the stationary killing field @xmath13 coincides with the null generator of the event horizon @xmath14 in addition to being timelike and hypersurface orthogonal in all the domain of outer communications @xmath15 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for sufficient conditions allowing that a stationary spacetime containing the above matter can be static ) .",

    "[ sec : conclu ] .",
    "in this section we analyze simultaneously the nonminimal couplings with @xmath1 as well as @xmath23 ; in both cases , it is possible to make the following redefinition for the scalar field @xmath25^{1/2}\\phi$ ] . upon contracting the einstein equations ( [ eq : ein ] ) and inserting the scalar field equation ( [ eq : k - g ] ) in the result ,",
    "the following expression for the scalar curvature , in terms of the redefined scalar field , arises @xmath26 where @xmath27^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "the right  hand side of this expression contains nonnegative terms .",
    "in particular , the kinetic term can be written as @xmath28 in the coordinates used in ( [ eq : static ] ) , where @xmath21 is positive definite .",
    "two facts follow from this consideration , first , by asymptotic flatness ( @xmath29 ) the scalar field vanishes asymptotically due to vanishing of the second term at the right  hand side of ( [ eq : curvii ] ) .",
    "second , since the domain of outer communications and the event horizon are regular regions , the left  hand side of ( [ eq : curvii ] ) is bounded everywhere , and hence , from the bounded behavior of the second term on the right  hand side of ( [ eq : curvii ] ) , the scalar field is also bounded everywhere .",

    "the reason for dealing with both couplings in the same fashion is that the corresponding scalar equation is the same in both cases .",
    "actually , for the minimal coupling @xmath9 the scalar equation ( [ eq : k - g ] ) reduces to @xmath71 the same equation also describes the conformal coupling @xmath10 , due to the fact that the conformal symmetry implies @xmath29 ; this can be noted from the contraction of the einstein equations ( [ eq : ein ] ) for @xmath10 , and the insertion of the scalar equation ( [ eq : k - g ] ) into the result .",

    "the remaining boundary integral over the portion of the horizon @xmath45 has again a vanishing integrand ; using the same arguments as in the previous section it can be shown that the term @xmath75 of the integrand vanishes at the horizon and since @xmath73 is ever bounded , independent of the value of the scalar field at the horizon , the product of both terms , @xmath76 , vanishes at the horizon .",
    "therefore , the boundary integral in ( [ eq : intiii ] ) vanishes and , in the coordinates of ( [ eq : static ] ) , we obtain @xmath77    the above integral identity , together with the non  negativeness of the associated integrand terms within it , imply vanishing of the scalar field @xmath7 in @xmath36 , and hence in all the domain of outer communications @xmath15 .",

    "each term on the right  hand side of this expression has the same sign again .",
    "since the left  hand side of the above relation is bounded everywhere , this implies that each term at the right  hand side of ( [ eq : curviv ] ) is bounded as well .",
