    "over the past few years an increasing interest to the motion of living organisms of different size and complexity ( movement ecology @xcite ) has lead to a large number of new experiments , some of them based on quite elaborated tools , allowing for study of this motion and for description of its observed trajectories .",
    "examples are the works on dicstyostelium @xcite , also under influence of chemotactic stimulus @xcite , on human motile keratinocytes and fibroblasts @xcite , on motile pieces of physarum @xcite , on flagellate eukaryotes ( euglena ) @xcite , also in time dependent light fields @xcite , and on more complex organisms as gastropods @xcite , zooplankton @xcite , birds @xcite and zebra - tail fish @xcite .",
    "one has also considered motion in the presence of boundaries which might substantially change its effective properties @xcite .",
    "similar conceptual approaches were used to describe the motion of non - living motile objects , so called self - propelled particles , exhibiting similar trajectories @xcite",
    ".    theoretical modeling of self - motile objects goes back to the beginning of the last century @xcite . trajectories often appear to be stochastic @xcite , thus special attention has been paid to the development of different stochastic models for various physical or biological situations .",
    "these investigations yielded a great variety of possible mathematical models for the description of motion of self - propelled objects .",
    "examples are the discrete hopping with a given turning angle distribution @xcite , the run and tumble model @xcite with polynomial waiting time densities exhibiting superdiffusive behavior etc . in order to determine the respective mean squared displacement ( msd ) of the diffusive motion langevin equations with associated kinetic equations for the probability densities",
    "have been introduced to describe propulsive motion under influence of noise sources , as modeled by white gaussian noise @xcite , by gaussian ornstein uhlenbeck process @xcite , or by dichotomic markovian process @xcite .",
    "escape rates of active particles @xcite , of active particles in external fields @xcite and active transport in cells @xcite have been studied as well . crawling patterns of drosophila larvae motion where analyzed in @xcite by using a bimodal persistent random walk model . here",
    ", the four parameters of the corresponding model were proved to be distinct for larvae with specific genetic mutations .",
    "this work elucidates the usefulness of elaborate , multiparametric models .    the origin of stochasticity , i.e. the nature of the noise sources",
    ", might be quite different , e.g. they may be due to neuronal activity , or due to interactions with the environment or with neighbors .",
    "the patchiness of the distribution of prey @xcite can be also considered as a noise source .",
    "there is still a debate on how to correctly describe various patterns of animal motion @xcite . in the present work",
    "we extend the model of an active particle moving at a constant speed with a stochastic angular dynamics @xcite to a more general case , when the random torques are described by an @xmath1-stable noise .",
    "these lvy or @xmath1-stable noise sources lead to a directed motion interrupted by large jumps in the angle of orientation @xcite .",
    "the sudden changes in the direction of movement and also the longer periods of curling appearing in this model might remind in particular the run and tumble processes @xcite .    in what follows",
    "we discuss two different angular dynamics . in the first case ,",
    "[ sec_tor_white ] , we consider the motion in the presence of a constant torque and of a source of a symmetric @xmath1-stable white noise .",
    "afterwards , in sec .",
    "[ sec_oup ] , we look at a non - white noise as generated by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( oup ) driven by a cauchy noise source . for both dynamics",
    "we derive the analytical expressions for the mean squared displacement ( msd ) and for the effective diffusion coefficient , and discuss the crossover from the ballistic motion to normal diffusion in coordinate space .",
    "we show that the msd , the diffusion coefficient , and the crossover time do not depend on the correlations in the noise source .",
    "recently , experiments on beads diffusing on macromolecules were performed @xcite and caught attention . in these experiments",
    "single particle tracking was used to follow the trajectories of the beads .",
    "the beads performed ( passive ) fickian diffusion , but a non - gaussian distribution of displacements was observed .",
    "these observations point out the necessity to pay special attention to the moments of the displacement distributions higher than the msd . in our model indeed , at difference to the behavior of the msd , the higher moments of the displacement are sensitive to correlations",
    ". in particular , in the diffusive regime of the oup - driven active particles we find an exponential distribution of displacements at short time lags while at longer time lags this distribution tends to a gaussian , an observation similar to the one reported by wang et al .",
    "@xcite . in our case",
    "this effect is caused by correlations in the noise which create an additional persistence in the motion .",
    "the crossover time after which the gaussian distribution is established depends strongly on these correlations .",
    "the the time evolution of the position vector @xmath5 of the particle is described by the following set of equations : @xmath6 @xmath7 where the angle @xmath8 gives the orientation of the velocity vector whose absolute value is @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath10 is a constant torque .",
    "the noise @xmath11 considered here is a @xmath1-stable noise . according to ditlevsen @xcite and schertzer @xcite , the associated fokker - planck - equation for such a system is given by : @xmath12 herein @xmath13 stands for the @xmath1-th symmetric riesz - weyl fractional derivative .",
    "the case @xmath14 corresponds to a gaussian white noise .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 controls the sudden large changes in the velocity orientation . for lower values of @xmath1",
    "the noise distribution becomes sharper around the center and the tails become more pronounced , so that the probability of large sudden changes in @xmath15 increases , while small changes become less likely .",
    "the conditional probability density of the orientation @xmath15 at time @xmath16 , given the initial angle @xmath17 at time @xmath18 of the velocity vector is given by the following expression @xcite : @xmath19 in the following we will set the initial values to @xmath20 and @xmath21 . with the help of eq .",
    "the msd for this dynamics can be easily calculated using the green - kubo relation . for simplicity of notation , we move the origin of the coordinate system to the initial position of the particle at time @xmath18 . hence we have as as initial values @xmath22 or @xmath23 and @xmath24 , if not explicitly defined otherwise .",
    "we assign @xmath25 .",
    "the msd becomes : @xmath26",
    "introducing @xmath27 and @xmath28 leads to the following form of the msd : @xmath29 for short times @xmath16 the msd shows ballistic behavior , i.e. @xmath30 . for times @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the crossover time , the motion becomes diffusive .",
    "the persistence length of the motion is @xmath33 and by that dependent on the noise type through the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath34 is given by @xmath35     as a function of the parameters of the noise : simulation ( symbols ) and theory ( curves ) for @xmath36 . ]    in the case of gaussian white noise @xmath37 the result of weber et al.@xcite is recovered . for @xmath38",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath39 decays with the growth of the scale parameter @xmath40 as a power law , with a power given by the index of the lvy distribution . using eq .",
    "we see that the effective diffusion coefficients becomes @xmath41 .    in fig.[msd_anf ]",
    "we show the effective diffusion coefficient @xmath34 for various values of @xmath1 and non - zero torque , as obtained in simulations and from ( eq . ) .",
    "the effective diffusion coefficient always shows a maximum at @xmath42 , where it is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "this maximal value of the diffusion coefficient does not depend on the properties of the noise . for @xmath44",
    "the diffusion coefficient vanishes for @xmath45 and for @xmath46 .",
    "how fast it vanishes depends on @xmath1 .",
    "the higher the value of @xmath1 the smaller becomes the width of the peak .",
    "all curves intersect at @xmath47 .",
    "one also notices that the diffusion for @xmath48 for a given @xmath40 can be both faster or slower than in the gaussian case . for small noise intensities the motion of the particle",
    "is dominated by the torque , the particle moves in circles and the diffusion is slow . increasing the noise stretches the trajectories till the diffusion reaches the maximum . behind the maximum",
    "the motion becomes noise - dominated , and the diffusion coefficient falls again .",
    "simulations show that for times @xmath16 larger than the crossover time @xmath49 the transition probability density of the spatial process becomes gaussian , @xmath50 notably , as simulations show , the crossover time between ballistic and diffusive behavior coincides with the establishment of this gaussian displacement distribution .",
    "the distribution of the final position depends only on the distance between the final and the initial points , and the dependence on the angle of the vector @xmath51 with respect to the initial orientation of the velocity is lost . as we had moved the origin of the coordinate system to the position of the particle at time @xmath18 ( @xmath52 ) , we write @xmath53 instead of @xmath54 for the absolute displacement .",
    "we set @xmath20 .",
    "the statistics of the absolute displacements is given by the rayleigh distribution .",
    "the probability density of @xmath55 reads : @xmath56 where we omit @xmath20 .",
    "we now consider colored noise in the angular dynamics .",
    "we use the ornstein - uhlenbeck process ( oup ) with a cauchy noise ( @xmath57 ) for the torque .",
    "the equations for the spatial coordinates and for the time evolution of the velocity ( eq . ) remain the same as before .",
    "the angular dynamics is given by @xmath58 where @xmath11 is white noise with increments following the cauchy distribution .",
    "in the limit @xmath59 in eq .",
    "this model coincides with the model from the previous section for @xmath57 . in the limit",
    "@xmath60 the noise vanishes , but if one takes @xmath61 another interesting limiting case emerges : now the angle @xmath62 becomes a lvy process : since in this limit @xmath63 we get @xmath64 ( here we took @xmath65 ) .    by introducing the oup , we get a stronger persistence in the particle s motion and introduce a new time scale , the correlation time @xmath2 . for times",
    "larger the crossover time @xmath0 the particles again perform a diffusive motion . surprisingly , as we proceed to show , the expressions for the crossover time , the msd and the diffusion coefficient coincide with eqs . and of the previous section . the onset of the asymptotic gaussian displacement distribution is however characterized by a new time scale @xmath4 which is in general different from @xmath0 as given by eq ..      the fokker - planck equation the oup with cauchy noise , eq.([oup ] ) , has the following form : @xmath66 the transition probability for eq.([fok_theta ] ) , given the initial condition @xmath67 at time @xmath18 , was first obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath68 the width of the stationary cauchy distribution for @xmath69 depends on @xmath40 only . for @xmath59 eq.([fok_phi ] ) becomes the white noise limit ( eq.([fok_white_phi ] ) ) .",
    "the angular transition probability density was determined in ref.@xcite : @xmath70 with @xmath71 and @xmath67 , @xmath17 being the values of @xmath69 and @xmath15 at time @xmath18 .",
    "the angular variable @xmath15 is a deterministic functional ( integral ) of the stochastic variable @xmath69 , and in @xcite it is pointed out that for fixed initial @xmath67 eq . represents a markov process . the cauchy case is the only case of an oup with an @xmath1-stable noise where the integrated process is markovian , and therefore the simplest one for the further analytical treatment .",
    "adding the torque and setting the initial time @xmath18 to zero results in @xmath72 using eq .",
    "one easily derives the expression for the msd .",
    "since the msd does not depend on the initial angle , we set @xmath21 . the second initial value @xmath67 has been averaged over the stationary limit of eq.([ptheta ] ) which is achieved for @xmath73 .",
    "the msd for the oup - cauchy is equal to that of an active particle from the previous sec .",
    "[ sec_tor_white ] , eqs . and with @xmath57 .",
    "averaging over initial conditions cancels any additional time dependence which would reflect the correlation behind the evolution of the direction of motion , in contrast to the oup with gaussian white noise @xcite .",
    "as the msd in our correlated case is the same as for an active particle with white angular noise with @xmath57 , the following properties stay the same : for times @xmath74 with @xmath75 the active particle moves ballistic . for times @xmath31 the regime of normal or fickian diffusion sets on , with the diffusion coefficient given by eq . with @xmath57 .",
    "the crossover from ballistic to diffusive behavior is well seen in fig.[figoupmsd ] .",
    "the behavior of the effective diffusion coefficient in dependence on other parameters was already shown in fig.[msd_anf ] for @xmath57 . for non - vanishing torque",
    "this diffusion coefficient has a maximum at @xmath76 and tends to zero for large and for small noise intensities .    ,",

    "align perfectly , the msd does not depend on the correlation time @xmath2 the crossover time from ballistic to diffusive motion is indicated by dashed line at time @xmath0 . ]",
    "it is remarkable that the msd and the diffusion coefficient are independent of the correlation time @xmath2 , so that the underlying correlations can not be detected from measuring the msd .",
    "therefore one might expect to observe a gaussian distribution for the displacements , eq .",
    ", for times @xmath78 and , respectively , the rayleigh distribution , eq . , for the absolute displacement for all such times .",

    "the behavior under the colored noise generates the pattern of motion strongly resembling the run and tumble situations or the behavior seen in experiments like @xcite where particles spend some time in confined motion , reorient themselves and then move on . for both physical models we derived analytical expressions for the mean squared displacement and for the effective diffusion coefficient",
    "astonishingly , in the case of cauchy - noise , the existence of correlations in the noise does not influence the msd , the effective diffusion coefficient and the crossover time @xmath0 from ballistic to diffusive motion coincide for both models with @xmath57 .",
    "the distribution function of the displacements is however strongly influenced by correlations in the noise even at the times well inside the diffusive regime .",

    "this colored noise mechanism might offer an approach to describe observations of a transient non - gaussian displacement distribution in diffusion experiments like those performed by wang et al . @xcite .",

    ". these moments might provide new information on the persistence of the motion .",
    "the studied case of the oup with cauchy noise is special , and the independence of msd of the correlation time @xmath2 of the noise is not a general situation .",
    "nevertheless , we expect deviations from a gaussian distribution generally in models with a correlated non - gaussian noise in the angular dynamics , like in @xcite .",

    "<S> the corresponding diffusion coefficient can be obtained analytically for the whole class of symmetric @xmath1-stable noises . as typical for models with noise - driven angular dynamics , the diffusion coefficient depends non - monotonously on the angular noise intensity . as second example , we study angular noise as described by an ornstein - uhlenbeck process with correlation time @xmath2 driven by the cauchy white noise . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the asymptotic diffusive properties of this model and obtain the same analytical expression for the diffusion coefficient as in the first case which is thus independent on @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , for @xmath3 the crossover from a non - gaussian to a gaussian distribution of displacements takes place at a time @xmath4 which can be considerably larger than the persistence time @xmath0 . </S>"
