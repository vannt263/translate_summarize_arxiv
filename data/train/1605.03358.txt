    ", similar motifs have been identified in genome - scale regulatory networks with dual strategies of regulation , i.e. , the regulatory interactions include both transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation @xcite . amongst the various types of motifs , the positive feedback loop has the potential for the generation of multistability , i.e. , the coexistence of more than one stable steady state for the same parameter values .",

    "the mutual inhibition ( double negative feedback ) defines a positive feedback loop and in terms of the steady state concentrations [ p@xmath0 and [ p@xmath1 of the two proteins , the stable steady states correspond to [ p@xmath0@xmath2[p@xmath1 and [ p@xmath1@xmath2[p@xmath0 respectively .",

    "the parameter values for the figure are given in table 1 .",
    "an examination of figure 3(_b _ ) shows that as the rate constant @xmath66 decreases from a high value , the value of the upper bifurcation point ( the value of @xmath67 at which an abrupt transition from the lower to the upper branch of stable steady states ) also decreases .",

    "with cooperativity taken into account ( _ n _ = 2 ) , the region of bistability becomes more extensive ( figure 4(b ) ) .",
    "in this case , both cooperativity and molecular sequestration contribute to the generation of the ultrasensitive response . in the presence of cooperativity ,",
    "the steady state response becomes sharper in the region of monostability .",
    "one important advantage of microrna - mediated regulation of gene expression is that micrornas ( as well as small rnas ) are known to suppress fluctuations in the target gene s protein levels @xcite .",

    "c.elegans_. the motif is found to be bistable over a wide parameter regime ( figure 4 ) .",
    "the occurence of bistability , even in the absence of cooperativity in regulation , is due to the combined effects of positive feedback and ultrasensitivity generated by molecular sequestration @xcite .",
    "the genetic toggle , on the other hand requires cooperativity in regulation to achieve bistability .",
    "post - transcriptional regulation , operative in the four - gene motif , involves molecular sequestration in the form of the bound microrna - mrna complex which is responsible for the generation of ultrasensitivity in the steady state concentration of mrnas / proteins as a function of the mrna synthesis rate constant .",
    "we provide another example of molecular - sequestration based bistability without cooperativity . in _ mycobacterium tuberculosis _ , the stress response network consists of multiple positive feedback loops involving the two - component system mprab and the gene _",

    "we now briefly discuss some other examples of bistability without cooperativity .",

    "a two - component system consists of a sensor kinase ( sk ) and a response regulator ( rr ) .",
    "the phosphorylated sk transfers the phosphate group to the rr which mediates the response to the stress signal . in general , the sk has a bifunctional character , it can act as a kinase in the phosphorylated state and as a phosphatase ( dephosphorylating the rr ) in the unphosphorylated state .",
    "the two - component system can exhibit bistability if the unphosphorylated sk and rr form a dead - end complex @xcite and ( or ) the phosphatase activity of the sk is much reduced ( abolished ) @xcite . a synthetic circuit constructed in _ e.coli _ with autoregulating t7 rna polymerase involves a non - cooperative positive feedback which by itself can not generate bistability .",
    "the expression of t7 rna slows down cell growth thus reducing protein dilution and creating an implicit positive feedback loop .",
    "the two loops , in combination , can give rise to bistability @xcite .",
    "several toxin - antitoxin operons are regulated according to the toxin / antitoxin ratio through a mechanism termed `` conditional cooperativity '' .",
    "the conditional regulation can give rise to bistability for a wide range of parameter values @xcite .",
    "additionally , stochastic effects can generate bistability / bimodal gene expression without the requirement of cooperativity in the regulation of gene expression @xcite . as discussed in section 2 , cooperativity in the regulation of gene expression has the effect of extending the region of bistability , a feature pointed out in several earlier studies @xcite .",
    "the ultrasensitivity in the case of post - transcriptional regulation is in the form of a linear threshold behaviour @xcite .",
    "the four - gene motif , incorporating both transcriptional and post - transcriptional regulation also exhibits linear threshold behaviour ( figure 3(_a _ ) ) .",
    "the theoretical prediction could be tested in the actual experimental setting of ref.@xcite or by constructing a synthetic genetic circuit , as in the case of the genetic toggle @xcite .",
    "the linear threshold behaviour , by setting a threshold for activated response , prevents spurious switchings to the active state . in the latter state , the response is analog , i.e. , graded .",
    "the threshold is further tunable through the modifications of the mrna and microrna synthesis rate constants .",
    "the four - gene motif , because of its enlarged parameter space , exhibits a novel steady state response ( figure 3(b ) ) which has not been reported earlier .",
    "the region of bistability separates two regions of monostability . in this region , response is digital because of the discontinious changes in response at the bifurcation points .",
    "the response further exhibits hysteresis whereas the response in the monostable regions is reversible .",
    "the four - gene motif thus combines the advantages of the linear threshold behaviour with bistability in order to mediate cellular decision making or act as a biological switch .",
    "the linear threshold behaviour provides the basis for an ultrasensitive switch with reversible response .",
    "the genetic toggle exhibits bistability in an extended parameter region with two monostable regions separating the region bistability . in the monostable regions ,",
    "the response is graded and featureless .",
    "the motifs studied in refs .",
    "@xcite exhibit tristability and thus can function as a three - way switch in contrast to the two - way switch behaviour of the motifs studied in our paper .",
    "the two - gene and four - gene motifs studied in the paper exhibit monostability or bistability depending on the parameter regime .",
    "motifs which include negative feedback loops and/or introduce time delays in gene expression can exhibit oscillations in protein concentrations @xcite .",
    "small rnas have been shown to establish delays and temporal thresholds in gene expression @xcite as well as generate oscillations in protein concentrations @xcite . motifs governed by transcriptional regulation are also known to exhibit oscillations @xcite .",
    "it will be of interest to compare the functional characteristics of motifs incorporating transcriptional and post - transcriptional modes of gene regulation respectively , in generating oscillatory dynamics .",
    "post - transcriptional regulation mediated by micrornas has the desirable feature of reducing the variability or noise in the target gene protein levels @xcite .",
    "the reduction is mainly due to the diminished burst sizes in protein production .",
    "reduction in protein noise , as compared to the case of unregulated gene expression , has been demonstrated experimentally in the cases of simple motifs with dual strategies of regulation of gene expression @xcite . a more recent study @xcite combines mathematical modeling with single cell experiments to establish that microrna - regulated gene expression results in lower intrinsic noise as compared to the case of unregulated gene expression .",
    "we compute the cv of the protein levels of a target gene in the steady state of the four - gene motif using the fd relation ( 10 ) .",
    "the cv is considerably lower than that in the case of the genetic toggle ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the four - gene motif , employing dual strategies of regulation , has greater noise - reduction capability than the genetic toggle incorporating only transcriptional regulation .    in section 3 of the paper , we have compared transcriptional regulation ( motif 1 ) with post - transcriptional regulation ( motif 2 ) from an information theoretic perspective . the channel capacity _",
