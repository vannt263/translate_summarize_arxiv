    "the latter goal is particularly motivated by the study of the connection between the high - magnetic field pulsars and magnetars . while on - going studies targeting this question focus on the compact objects themselves ( see e.g. ng & kaspi 2011 and references therein ) , we here approach this question by examining the snrs associated with these objects . in a follow - up paper",
    ", we address the progenitor mass of snr  kes  73 associated with a magnetar ( a preliminary study was presented in kumar et al .",

    "snr g292.20.5 was observed with _ chandra _ on 2004 october 31november 1 ( obsid : 4676 ) and 2004 november 23 ( obsid : 6153 ) for exposure times of 61.31 ks and 19.14 ks , respectively .",
    "the coordinates were positioned at the aimpoint of the back - illuminated s3 chip of the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) onboard the _ chandra x - ray observatory_. these two observations of the eastern side of the snr were combined with the previous _ chandra _ observation covering the western side and taken on 2002 march 31april 1 ( obsid : 2833 ) for an exposure time of 57.55 ks .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the combined analysis of all the above mentioned observations .",
    "the ccd temperature was @xmath38120@xmath40 c with a ccd frame readout time of 3.2 s in ` timed ' and ` very faint ' mode .",
    "the data were then reduced using the standard _",
    "chandra _ interactive analysis of observations ( ciao ) version 4.3 routines .",
    "the level 1 raw event data were reprocessed to a new level 2 event file to remove pixel randomization and to correct for ccd charge transfer inefficiencies .",
    "the bad grades were filtered out and good time intervals were reserved .",
    "the resulting effective exposure times for the three observations after data processing are summarized in table 1 .",
    ".summary of the effective exposure times for snr g292.20.5 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < \" , ]      as discussed earlier under section 3 , the eastern and western sides of snr g292.20.5 appear different in morphology .",
    "it has been suggested that asymmetry and differences within an snr can be observed if the ism is not isotropic ( cox et al .",
    "1999 ) or if the snr is interacting with a molecular cloud ( chevalier 1999 ) .",
    "p01 had already suggested the presence of a dark cloud dc 292.30.4 , catalogued by hartley et al .",
    "( 1986 ) from a visual inspection of the eso / serc southern @xmath41 survey plates , towards the eastern side of the snr with a diameter of @xmath1316@xmath30 and an estimated contribution to @xmath42 of @xmath13(67)@xmath410@xmath43 @xmath6 .",
    "this is further supported by our imaging analysis ( figure  1 ) , which shows a lack of soft x - ray emission from the eastern side of the snr , suggesting the presence of additional absorbing material or a cloud absorbing the soft x - rays in that region .",
    "furthermore , our spatially resolved spectroscopic study clearly indicates a higher column density in the eastern side ( see table  3 ) , with @xmath42=1.8@xmath7@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 for snr  east versus 1.0@xmath3@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 for snr  west .",
    "we estimate that this absorbing material should be contributing an @xmath42 of @xmath138@xmath410@xmath43 @xmath6 , the difference in @xmath42 between snr  east and snr  west , which is consistent with that inferred for the dark cloud ( p01 ) .",
    "we further investigate the above scenario by inspecting the region surrounding snr g292.20.5 .",
    "figure  6 ( a ) shows the optical intensity image obtained from eso digitized sky survey ( dss ) and smoothed using a gaussian of @xmath44=5@xmath32 . overlaid on the image ( green circle ) is the catalogued dark cloud dc 292.30.4 ( harley et al .",
    "1986 ) , centered at @xmath45=11@xmath4620@xmath4725@xmath48 and @xmath49=@xmath3861@xmath4022@xmath3000@xmath32 and with a radius of 8@xmath30 .",
    "the catalogued size clearly exceeds the extent of the cloud seen in the dss image ( see also figure 6 ( b ) ) . in the same image , we also identify another dark region ( shown by a green ellipse towards the centre of the image ) centered at approximately @xmath45=11@xmath4619@xmath4719@xmath50 and @xmath49=@xmath3861@xmath4031@xmath3003@xmath32.0 with a size of @xmath246@xmath30.5@xmath42@xmath30.2 , and which appears to overlap with snr  east and most of psr  east ( regions 1 and 2 , respectively , shown as white ellipses ) .",
    "the small purple cross in figure  6 ( a ) marks the position of psr j1119 - 6127 . in figure  6 ( b ) , we overlay , in red , the corresponding dark cloud contours from the dss image on the _ xmm - newton _ mos ( black contours ) and _ chandra _ ( blue contours ) x - ray images . we speculate that the dark elliptical region in the south - eastern field of g292.2@xmath380.5 likely represents another uncatalogued dark cloud ; alternatively it could be a previously unidentified substructure of dc 292.30.4 since the cloud size reported by hartley et al .",
    "( 1986 ) does not accurately reflect the shape of the cloud seen in the dss image .",
    "this is corroborated by the detection of two co features with line of velocities of @xmath3812.6  km  s@xmath18 and @xmath381.6  km  s@xmath18 towards the centre of dc 292.30.4 ( otrupcek et al .",
    "2000 ) . while its not clear whether both features are associated with the same cloud to the north - east ( catalogued by hartley et al .",
    "1986 ) , it is possible that one of them could be associated with the cloud we have identified coinciding with the south - eastern side of the remnant . to the best of our knowledge , there is no co observation targeted to study this dark cloud .",
    "as well , we are not aware of any recent co study of the environment of g292.2@xmath380.5 .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of these dark clouds towards the eastern part of the remnant and the detected co features support the presence of additional foreground absorbing material that would explain the lack of soft x - ray emission from that region .",
    "furthermore , the dark cloud largely obscuring psr  east ( figure  6 ) could further explain the lack of bright emission from psr  east in comparison with the emission from psr ",
    "west ( figure  2 ) .",
    "next , we discuss the observed morphology and the non - thermal emission from the eastern side of the remnant in the light of a possible interaction with a nearby cloud .",
    "the presence of an adjacent cloud can affect the evolution and appearance of a snr as suggested e.g. by wardle & yusef - zadeh ( 2002 ) .",
    "the expanding snr is slowed at the location of the cloud , causing it to appear distorted .",
    "the reflected shock from the cloud moves into the interior of the remnant and interacts with the snr - driven shock waves .",
    "this results in heating the cloud material and filling the interior of the snr with gas , which can substantially modify the x - ray emission and lead to a composite - type morphology ( rho & petre 1999 ) . the hot thermal x - ray emission detected from the snr interior supports this scenario .",
    "such an interaction however is expected to lead to oh maser emission ( wardle & yusef - zadeh 2002 ) , but to the best of our knowledge no maser emission has been detected from g292.20.5 .",
    "furthermore , acceleration of particles to very high energies at the shock - cloud interface can cause synchrotron radiation observed at x - ray wavelengths , as e.g. in the case of snr rcw  86 ( borkowski et al . 2001b ) .",
    "the spectrum of snr ",
    "east is indeed best fitted by a thermal+non - thermal model ; the non - thermal component could then be interpreted as arising from the interaction of the sn shock wave with a nearby molecular cloud .",
    "morphologically , this is supported by the correspondence between the hard x - ray emission from snr - east and the radio shell ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "we note however that the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ observations do not fully cover the radio shell . as well , the non - thermal x - ray flux is only @xmath1310% of the thermal flux , and no tev emission has been detected from that region ( djannati et al .",
    "2009 , see next section ) as observed in other interacting snrs .",
    "furthermore , the hard power - law photon index ( @xmath31=1.2@xmath51 ) inferred for snr ",
    "east is unusually hard and puzzling .",
    "more sensitive x - ray observations with coverage of the radio shell , as well as co observations towards the eastern side of the remnant , are needed to confirm or rule out any interaction with a molecular cloud .",
    "as pointed out above and summarized in table  3 , our study confirms the gsh05 result for the presence of hard non - thermal x - ray emission from the snr .",
    "the additional _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations allowed us to fit for two - component models ( thermal+non - thermal ) , resolve the non - thermal emission , and better constrain the spectral properties of both components .    while the emission from the snr is mostly dominated by thermal emission best described by a non - equilibrium ionization model with @xmath0@xmath521  kev and an ionization timescale of @xmath1310@xmath12  @xmath10  s , the emission from most regions ( except for snr ",
    "west ) required an additional non - thermal component described by a power law model with a hard photon index , @xmath31@xmath1312 .",
    "the total non - thermal x - ray luminosity in the studied regions is 6.1@xmath410@xmath53  @xmath54  ergs  s@xmath18 , which is @xmath134% of the total snr emission . in the previous section",
    ", we discussed the origin of the non - thermal emission from snr  east as possibly due to the interaction between the snr and a cloud in the east ( see figure  6 ) .",
    "as to the psr ",
    "west and psr  east regions , the non - thermal emission can be attributed to two scenarios : ( 1 ) the leakage of high - energy particles from the pulsar or its pwn into the snr , and/or ( 2 ) particles accelerated at the supernova shock leading to a synchrotron component in the high - energy end of the x - ray spectrum , as observed in a growing number of non - thermal snr shells such as g347.30.5 ( slane et al .",
    "both scenarios were discussed in gsh05 . here",
    ", we further explore these scenarios in the light of the new data .    in the first scenario ,",
    "the non - thermal emission is attributed to relativistic particles originating from the psr or its associated pwn .",
    "we favor this scenario due to : a ) the location of the selected regions with respect to the pulsar and its associated pwn well inside the snr shell , and 2 ) the resemblance between their photon indices .",
    "psr j1119@xmath386127 has a photon index of @xmath31=1.9@xmath55 ( using a power - law + blackbody model fit ) and its associated compact pwn has a @xmath31=1.1@xmath56 ( safi - harb & kumar 2008 ) .",
    "an elongated jet - like feature south of the pulsar was also characterized by a similarly hard power - law index ( @xmath31@xmath131.4 ) .",
    "these values are consistent with the photon index obtained for psr  east ( @xmath31=0.9@xmath57 ) and psr  west ( @xmath31=1.5@xmath58 ) , suggesting a similar particle population .",
    "the non - thermal x - ray luminosity from psr  east and psr  west amounts to @xmath133.3@xmath410@xmath53@xmath54  ergs  s@xmath18 , which represents only @xmath130.1% of the pulsar s spin - down energy , @xmath20 .    for the second scenario , the thermal x - ray emission from psr  east and psr  west hints at enhanced metal abundances , suggesting the presence of ejecta heated by the reverse shock . for the non - thermal component ,",
    "the photon index , @xmath31@xmath130.72.0 ( table  3 ) , is however harder than that seen in all non - thermal snrs ( where @xmath31@xmath1323 ) .",
    "as well , the acceleration to high energies in the non - thermal snr shells is believed to take place at the forward , not the reverse , shock .",
    "this , together with the presence of non - thermal emission in the snr interior , argue against shock acceleration at the supernova shock wave as an origin .",
    "whether acceleration at the reverse shock can explain at least part of the x - ray emission remains an open question to be explored with further observations and modeling .    in summary , we favour the model for non - thermal emission arising , at least partly , from relativistic particles injected by the pulsar or its pwn .",
    "this is further corroborated by the detection of tev emission offset from the pulsar with h.e.s.s .",
    "( djannati et al .",
    "2009 ) , with its peak located between psr  west and snr  west as shown by the purple cross in figure  6 ( b ) .",
    "although the origin of tev emission is not yet clearly identified , djannati et al .",
    "( 2009 ) suggest that the emission could be attributed to an offset pwn , where the nebula has been displaced after being crushed by an asymmetric reverse shock caused by the presence of the dark cloud in the north - east .",
    "an origin for the gamma - ray emission in cosmic ray acceleration at a supernova shock requires a higher ambient density ( @xmath131  @xmath10 , djannati et al .",
    "2009 ) which is ruled out by our spectral study .",
    "we can not however rule out a higher density medium in the regions that we could not study either due to lack of coverage by the x - ray instruments or due to low - count spectra , especially in the south - west where the tev emission peaks .",
    "the faint and hot gas seen however from the southern region ( covered only by _ xmm - newton _ , see section 4.5 ) suggests expansion in a more tenuous medium .",
    "one of the primary objectives of this paper is to estimate the progenitor mass of snr g292.20.5 .",
    "this goal is motivated by studying the connection between high - magnetic field pulsars and magnetars through studying their environments / associated snrs . in the following ,",
    "we discuss the implication on the progenitor mass for snr g292.2@xmath380.5 from our x - ray spectroscopy , and discuss previously suggested models for the progenitor mass of this snr and other highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "x - ray spectroscopy has proven to be a powerful tool to infer the mass of progenitor stars for young snrs dominated by shock - heated ejecta . by comparing the abundances of heavy elements inferred from fitting x - ray spectra to the nucleosynthesis yields inferred from core - collapse models such as those of woosley & weaver 1995 ( hereafter ww95 ) and thielemann et al .",
    "1996 ( hereafter tnh96 ) , the mass of the progenitor star can be determined .",
    "ww95 provides nucleosynthesis yields for core - collapse supernovae of varying masses ranging from 1340@xmath14 whereas tnh96 provides the yields specifically for the 13 , 15 , 20 and 25@xmath14 progenitor stars .",
    "however , the yields obtained from these two models for a particular progenitor star differ due to the different assumptions used in the processes such as convection , explosion energy and mechanism , mass - loss , and initial metallicity ( hoffman et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the tnh96 models produce more ne and mg , and less fe in the more massive ( @xmath592025 @xmath14 ) stars than the ww95 models , while they agree fairly well with each other for the lower mass stars ( @xmath6020@xmath14 ) .",
    "also , ww95 specify models a , b , and c for stars of progenitor masses @xmath5930@xmath14 .",
    "the difference between these models is that the final kinetic energies at infinity ( @xmath61 ) of the ejecta for models b and c are enhanced by a factor of @xmath131.5 and @xmath132 , respectively , with respect to model a ( @xmath61@xmath131.2@xmath410@xmath62  ergs ) . keeping in mind the above differences",
    ", the inference on the progenitor masses may likely be different depending on the models used . in our studies",
    ", we focus on the ww95 nucleosynthesis models which provide a wider range of progenitor masses and finer mass steps .    the nucleosynthesis models mentioned above",
    "show that the mass or relative abundance ratio [ x / si]/[x / si]@xmath63 of ejected mass of any element x with respect to silicon ( si ) varies significantly as a function of the progenitor mass . under the assumption of the detection of ejecta in g292.20.5 ( see section 5.1 and table  3 ) , we subsequently estimate the abundance ratios for the reverse - shocked regions . in figure 7",
    ", we plot the average values of these ratios and their root mean square ( rms ) scatter ( shown in red ) . also , over - plotted are the predicted ww95 relative abundances ( estimated from the derived production factors after radioactive decay ) for different progenitors of masses 15 , 18 , 20 , 25 , 30 , and 35 @xmath14 .",
    "we find that the average abundance ratios fit the expectation of a 30@xmath14 progenitor star within error .",
    "we also compare our values with the tnh96 nucleosynthesis model yields for 13 , 15 , 20 and 25@xmath14 progenitors and find that our best - fit values are consistent with the 25 solar - mass model .",
    "we conclude that both the ww95 and tnh96 models predict a high - mass ( @xmath132530@xmath14 ) progenitor star for snr g292.2 - 0.5 and that our best fit abundance values rule out lower mass progenitors .",
    "we caution the reader however that this conclusion is based on three data points and on the fact that the abundances are only slightly enhanced .",
    "more sensitive observations are needed to confirm the presence of ejecta and better constrain the metal abundances , including o and fe which are important diagnostics for the progenitor mass estimate , but were at the limit of our detection .",
    "chevalier ( 2005 ) suggests that psr j11196127/snr g292.20.5 may belong to either the sn iip or ib / c categories .",
    "theoretical models suggest that sne iip come from stars of mass @xmath131025@xmath14 ( heger et al .",
    "2003 ) with relatively low - mass rates and are expected to explode as red supergiants ( rsgs ) with most of their h envelope present , giving rise to the extended plateau emission . during the supernova explosion resulting in a sn iip ,",
    "the massive h envelope is able to decelerate the core material and the reverse shock wave carries h back toward the center .",
    "also , due to their low mass loss , the rsg winds extend only to a small distance of @xmath601  pc from the progenitor and is surrounded by a low - density wind bubble created during the main - sequence phase ( chevalier 2005 ) . on the other hand , sne ib / c result from wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars of mass @xmath593035@xmath14 ( heger et al . 2003 ) , formed after a rsg phase or a brief luminous blue variable phase during which they have shed most of their outer h envelopes .",
    "w - r stars are characterized by high mass - loss rates ( @xmath64@xmath1310@xmath65@xmath14  yr@xmath18 ) and high - velocity stellar winds ( @xmath66@xmath131000  km  s@xmath18 ) .",
    "the fast moving w - r winds can sweep up the circumstellar and slow - velocity wind materials , clearing out a low - density wind bubble around the star which can extend to @xmath6710  pc over a duration of 2@xmath410@xmath68  yr ( chevalier 2005 ) .",
    "the inferred low ambient density ( table  4 ) , low snr x - ray luminosity , and the high progenitor mass inferred above from our x - ray spectroscopic study , all point to a w - r progenitor star , thus ruling out the sn iip progenitor .",
    "we now briefly discuss the progenitor mass studies done on magnetars and other high - magnetic field pulsars .",
    "it had been previously suggested by a few authors that magnetars descend from massive progenitors .",
    "for example , the progenitor masses of the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) 180620 and cxou j164710.2 - 455216 associated with the clusters cl 180620 and westerlund 1 ( wd 1 ) were determined as 48@xmath69@xmath14 and 40@xmath235@xmath14 , respectively ( figer et al . 2005 ; bibby et al .",
    "2008 ; muno et al .",

    "only two of them ( psrs j11196127 and j18460258 ) are so far associated with snrs .",
    "psr  j18460258 associated with the snr kes  75 recently displayed a magnetar - like behaviour ( gavriil et al .",
    "2008 ; kumar & safi - harb 2008 ) .",

    "2007 ; su et al . 2009 ) .    in summary",
    ", while most current studies seem to be pointing to highly magnetized neutron stars having massive progenitors ( @xmath5225@xmath14 ) , further studies in x - rays and other wavelengths are needed to address this interesting question .",
    "we have presented the first detailed imaging and spatially resolved x - ray spectroscopic study of the galactic snr g292.20.5 , associated with the high - magnetic field pulsar , psr j1119@xmath386127 , combining all the available _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations . the regions selected for spectroscopy are shown in figure 2 .",
    "we summarize here our findings :    * the high - resolution images show diffuse emission across the snr , with brighter and softer emission in the west .",
    "while the snr has been classified as a shell - type remnant in the radio , the x - ray morphology suggests a composite - type snr , with both thermal and non - thermal x - ray emission from the interior regions .",
    "an elongated and bright limb is particularly visible in the west in both the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ images , which partially coincides with the snr shell seen in the radio ( see figure  1 ) . *",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission from the snr is dominated by thermal emission from hot plasma , best described by an absorbed plane - parallel shock , non - equilibrium ionization model ( vpshock in xspec ) with a temperature @xmath0@xmath521  kev ( ranging from @xmath131.3 kev in snr  west to @xmath132.3 kev in snr ",
    "east ) and with an ionization timescale of @xmath1310@xmath12 @xmath10  s ( ranging from @xmath136@xmath410@xmath70 @xmath10  s in the interior to @xmath133@xmath410@xmath12 @xmath10  s in snr  west ) indicating that the plasma has not yet reached ionization equilibrium  a result that is consistent with a young snr expanding in a very low - density medium .",
    "the thermal fits indicate the presence of slightly enhanced abundances from ne , mg , si , hinting for the first time at the presence of ejecta heated by the reverse shock .",
    "the metal abundances inferred for snr  west are consistent with solar or sub - solar values .",
    "this , together with the higher ionization timescale and the morphology of this region , suggest that its emission arises from the supernova blast wave or shocked circumstellar matter . *",
    "the eastern side of the remnant is fainter than the western side and is characterized by harder x - ray emission ( @xmath0=2.3@xmath2 kev ) and a higher column density ( @xmath42=1.8@xmath7@xmath410@xmath5 @xmath6 , @xmath138@xmath410@xmath43 higher than in snr  west ) .",
    "an investigation of the eastern field with optical dss data suggests the presence of two dark clouds : one to the north - east coinciding with dc 292.3@xmath380.4 , a dark cloud catalogued by hartley et al .",
    "( 1986 ) and discussed by p01 , and another , previously uncatalogued , dark cloud to the south - east overlapping the emission from snr - east and psr - east",
    ". these spectral and imaging properties are consistent with the presence of an intervening cloud to the east that would explain the lack of soft x - ray emission from the eastern side of the remnant .",
    "* an additional non - thermal component , described by a power - law model with a hard photon index ( @xmath31@xmath130.72.0 ) and representing @xmath134% of the total flux , is needed for the regions in the east ( snr  east and psr  east ) and in the western region close to the pulsar ( psr  west ) . the emission from snr ",
    "east could be attributed to the interaction with the nearby cloud , although the photon index appears unusually hard and so far there is no evidence of tev or oh maser emission from this region .",
    "the emission from psr  east and psr  west can be attributed to leakage of relativistic particles from the pulsar or its associated pwn .",
    "the detection of tev emission with h.e.s.s . from the south - western region ( between psr - west and snr - west ) supports this conclusion , although a further investigation of this region is needed .",
    "* using an snr diameter of @xmath1317@xmath30.5 and a distance of 8.4  kpc , we derive an snr age ranging between 4.2  @xmath34 kyr ( free expansion phase , assuming an expansion velocity of 5000 km  s@xmath18 ) and 7.1  @xmath34  kyr ( sedov phase ) . for the sedov phase estimate , we assume that the snr - west region represents emission from the blast wave shocking the interstellar or circumstellar medium .",
    "this snr age range is a factor of a few higher than the pulsar s estimated age upper limit of 1.9  kyr .",
    "we discuss the discrepancy between the snr and pulsar age estimates and conclude that this may be attributed to a variable braking index for the pulsar , which has also shown recently some unusual timing characteristics at radio wavelengths . requiring the snr s age to be @xmath711.9",
    "kyr implies an unusually high expansion velocity @xmath7211200  @xmath34  km  s@xmath18 throughout its life , which is at odds with the observations ( especially given the asymmetry of the remnant and since the snr appears to be transitioning from the ejecta - dominated , free expansion phase , to the sedov phase ) .",
    "the sedov phase gives a lower limit on the shock velocity of @xmath131.1@xmath410@xmath73  km  s@xmath18 and an explosion energy of @xmath526@xmath410@xmath74  @xmath75 ergs , under the assumption of an explosion in a uniform ism .",
    "the total x - ray luminosity from the studied snr regions is @xmath76 ( 0.510 kev ) @xmath521.7@xmath410@xmath77",
    "@xmath54  ergs  s@xmath18 .",
    "* using the enhanced metal abundances inferred from our fits and comparing to core - collapse nucleosynthesis model yields , we infer a progenitor mass of @xmath1330@xmath14 , a result that supports a sn type ib / c origin and other studies suggesting very massive progenitors for the highly magnetized neutron stars .",
    "* we have studied other ( fainter ) regions in the snr in the north and south covered only by the _ xmm - newton _ observation .",
    "our fits indicate also the presence of hot plasma that has not reached ionization equilibrium , possibly combined with non - thermal emission , however the statistics did not allow us to constrain the models .",
    "deeper and more sensitive observations that cover the entire snr and the radio shell are needed to better constrain the x - ray emission throughout the remnant and confirm the metal abundances in the snr . *",
    "targeted co , and other wavelength , studies of the environment of g292.2@xmath380.5 are needed to confirm or rule out any interaction with a nearby molecular cloud , and to explain the tev emission detected with h.e.s.s . in the south - west .",
