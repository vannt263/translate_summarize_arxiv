    "the possibility of _ distillation _ plays a crucial role in quantum communication and quantum information processing ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . together with quantum error correction",
    "it enables all the fascinating applications provided by quantum information theory in the presence of a noisy and interacting environment . despite its practical relevance and quite considerable effort in that direction , however , many of the basic questions concerning distillation are yet unanswered . most notably the question whether a given quantum state is distillable or not , i.e. , whether it is possible to obtain pure maximally entangled states from several copies of it by means of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .    a necessary condition for the distillability of a state described by a density matrix @xmath0 is the fact that its partial transpose @xmath1 , defined with respect to a given product basis by @xmath2 , has a negative eigenvalue @xcite . except for special cases like states on @xmath3 @xcite and gaussian states",
    "@xcite it is however unclear whether this condition is sufficient as well .",
    "there is some evidence presented in @xcite that this may not be the case and that there are indeed undistillable states , whose partial transpose is not positive ( nppt ) .",
    "at least there exist @xmath4-undistillable nppt states for every finite @xmath4 , meaning that no locc operation on @xmath4 copies leads even to a single entangled two qubit state @xcite .",
    "however , if we enlarge the class of allowed distillation protocols from locc to channels respecting the positivity of the partial transpose , then every nppt state becomes 1-distillable @xcite ( which can be shown by using _",
    "entanglement witnesses _",
    "moreover , it is a result from @xcite that these channels can always be stochastically implemented by an locc operation where the two parties are given an entangled state with positive partial transpose ( ppt ) as an additional resource .",
    "the latter is known to be _ bound entangled _ since the entanglement needed for the preparation of the state can not be recovered by distillation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , ppt bound entangled states can be useful in order to _ activate _ the distillability of bipartite nppt states @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate the limits and requirements of such an activation process .",
    "we will show that there exist states with an arbitrary small amount of ppt bound entanglement , which are capable of activating any nppt state .",
    "the required additional resource is therefore universal as well as arbitrary weakly entangled .",
    "one of the key ideas in what follows will be the exploitation of the symmetry properties of states commuting with certain local unitaries .",
    "two well known one - parameter families of such states are the _",
    "werner states _ and _ isotropic states _ , both playing an important role in the sequel .    _ werner states",
    "_ @xcite acting on a hilbert space @xmath5 with dimensions @xmath6 commute with all unitaries of the form @xmath7 and can be written as @xmath8 , \\ ] ] with @xmath9 being the _ flip operator _ defined with respect to some product basis by @xmath10 .",
    "a werner state is entangled iff @xmath11 $ ] and 1-distillable iff @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that any nppt state can be mapped onto an entangled werner state by means of locc operations .",
    "therefore we can in the following restrict our discussion to the activation of werner states keeping in mind that the obtained results hold for any nppt state .    _ isotropic states _",
    "@xcite commuting with all unitaries of the form @xmath13 ( where @xmath14 is the complex conjugate of @xmath15 ) are combinations of the maximally mixed state @xmath16 and the projector @xmath17 onto the maximally entangled state @xmath18 .\\ ] ] an isotropic state @xmath19 is known to be 1-distillable iff the _ maximally entangled fraction _",
    "@xmath20 , which is a sufficient condition for any other state as well @xcite .",
    "hence , an activation protocol succeeded if this condition is fulfilled by the final state .    the symmetric states playing the central role in the present paper act on a larger hilbert space @xmath21 of total dimension @xmath22 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 again label the two parts of the system situated at different locations .",
    "the symmetry group under consideration is the group of all unitaries of the form @xmath25 .",
    "states @xmath26 commuting with all these unitaries can most easily be expressed in terms of the minimal projectors @xmath27 spanning the commutant of the group @xcite : @xmath28=0 \\quad & \\leftrightarrow & \\quad \\sigma =    \\sum_{i=1}^4    \\lambda_i p_i / { { \\rm tr}\\left[p_i\\right]},\\label{uuua}\\\\   \\mbox{with}\\qquad\\quad p_{{1}\\atop{2 } } & = & \\frac12 \\big({\\bf 1}\\mp \\mathbb{f}\\big)_1\\otimes \\mathbb{p}_2 , \\\\",

    "positivity and normalization of @xmath26 requires @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that any state of the considered symmetry can be characterized by a vector @xmath33 lying in a tetrahedron , which is given by these constraints .",
    "we note further that the set of symmetric states in ( [ uuua ] ) is abelian , i.e. , all symmetric states commute with each other .    the _ activation protocol _ we use follows closely an idea of ref .",
    "initially the two parties @xmath23 and @xmath24 are supposed to share a werner state @xmath34 acting on @xmath35 with @xmath36 and a symmetric state @xmath26 on @xmath37 given by eq.([uuua ] ) . after a local filtering operation is applied by projecting onto maximally entangled states @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( acting on @xmath40 respectively",

    "@xmath34 if @xmath43",
    ". since the output state of the protocol is itself isotropic , this condition is also necessary for the activation .    of course , we are only interested in cases where @xmath44 $ ] , i.e. , @xmath34 is entangled but not 1-distillable , and @xmath26 is in turn a ppt bound entangled state .",
    "the latter requires the classification of the symmetric states in ( [ uuua ] ) , which is the content of the next section .",
    "the following discussion will mainly take place in the three dimensional space given by the expansion coefficients @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ uuua ] ) .",
    "a vector @xmath46 corresponds to a ( positive and normalized ) symmetric state @xmath47 iff @xmath48 , where the state space @xmath49 is a tetrahedron .",
    "the set @xmath50 corresponding to normalized operators with a positive partial transpose can easily be obtained by observing that the symmetry group of the partially transposed operators @xmath51 in ( [ uuua ] ) is equal to the group of unitaries @xmath52 when interchanging the systems @xmath53 .",
    "the respective minimal projectors @xmath54 can therefore be obtained from the projectors @xmath27 simply by relabeling the systems @xmath53 , and the @xmath55-th coordinate of an extreme point @xmath56 of @xmath50 is thus given by @xmath57}/{{\\rm tr}\\left[q_i\\right]}.\\ ] ] hence , @xmath50 is again a tetrahedron and eq .",
    "( [ pi ] ) leads to the extreme points : @xmath58    straight forward linear algebra now allows us to compute the extreme points @xmath59 of the intersection @xmath60 corresponding to the set of symmetric ppt states , which is shown in fig.[figppt ] : @xmath61    the ppt state space given by the convex hull of these points can be divided into three parts : separable states and activating respectively not activating bound entangled states .",
    "a vector @xmath62 corresponds to a separable symmetric state iff we can find any ( not necessarily symmetric ) separable state @xmath63 such that @xmath64}$ ] ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "a special case of a symmetric separable state is of course a tensor product of a werner and an isotropic state @xmath65 , where both are separable .",
    "in fact , if we choose these two states lying on the separable boundaries , i.e. , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , we retrieve the extreme points @xmath68 .",
    "another point @xmath69 , that will also turn out to be an extreme point of the set of separable symmetric states , is obtained from the product state : @xmath70 and @xmath71 are two - dimensional maximally entangled states .",
    "the convex hull of the points @xmath72 ( see fig.[figppt ] ) already covers the entire separable region as we are going to show in the following that the complement of this polytope within @xmath73 corresponds to bound entangled states .",
    "the equation @xmath74 written out as @xmath75 , with @xmath76}}{{{\\rm tr}\\left[p_i\\right]}}\\ ] ] is linear in @xmath77 and thus defines a plane separating symmetric states activating @xmath34 from states apparently not activating it .",
    "the task is now to construct this separating plane depending on the parameter @xmath78 .    as we have already used above , the points @xmath79 correspond to product states of the form @xmath80 for which @xmath81 obviously holds for any werner state @xmath34 .",
    "thus @xmath79 are two fix points of the separating plane with respect to a variation of @xmath78 and we need to know only one more point . for this purpose",
    "we consider the line @xmath82 .",
    "solving the equation @xmath83 yields the required third point with @xmath84 this is obviously a strict monotone function in @xmath78 and it leads to the following properties of the separating plane :    1 .   for @xmath85 corresponding to the boundary werner state which is not 1-distillable , eq .",
    "( [ t ] ) leads to @xmath86 , showing that @xmath87 indeed lies on the boundary of the set of separable states .",
    "that is , any ppt state in front of the plane @xmath88 must be bound entangled since it activates at least @xmath89 .",
    "2 .   in the limit @xmath90 ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath34 becoming less and less entangled , @xmath91 approaches @xmath92",
    ". however , for any @xmath93 the polytope @xmath94 has a nonempty interior corresponding to ppt bound entangled states capable of activating any @xmath34 with @xmath95 .",
    "3 .   except for the line",
    "@xmath96 all ppt states on the plane @xmath97 lie on the activating side of the separating plane for any @xmath98 .",
    "the corresponding symmetric states can thus be considered to be _ universal activators _ in the sense that they activate any entangled werner state and therefore any nppt state .",
    "the set of bound entangled _",
    "universal activators _ contains states arbitrary close to the line @xmath96 which in turn corresponds to separable states . by the continuity properties of the entanglement measures _",
    "entanglement of formation _ @xcite and _ relative entropy of entanglement _",
    "@xcite this geometric vicinity , however , translates directly to the proposition that these states contain an arbitrary small amount of entanglement .",
    "in order to complete the classification of the symmetric states introduced in eq .",
    "( [ uuua ] ) we have still to determine the entanglement properties of the states corresponding to the tetrahedron @xmath99 . the plane separating this set from the separable states derived above is characterized by a linear operator @xmath52 via @xmath100}=0 $ ] , where @xmath101 however , this operator is an _ entanglement witness _ ( cf.@xcite ) , meaning that @xmath102}\\geq 0 $ ] holds for any separable state @xmath0 . in order to see this property we have just to utilize the results from @xcite , where it was shown that @xmath103 has a positive expectation value on any pure state of schmidt rank two .",
    "since the antisymmetric projector @xmath104 is a sum of schmidt rank two states , @xmath105 is a sum of such positive expectations for any pure product state @xmath106 .",
    "hence , @xmath102}\\geq 0 $ ] is indeed fulfilled by any separable state implying that the tetrahedron under discussion corresponds to bound entangled symmetric states which are however not activating ( with respect to the considered protocol ) .",
    "we investigated the entanglement properties of a new abelian set of symmetric states with regard to the activation of nppt distillation .",
    "the set contains ppt bound entangled states of full rank providing a universal resource for the activation of any nppt state ( in any finite dimension ) .",
    "some of these _ universal activators _ lie arbitraryly close to separable states such that the activation process turns out to require only an infinitesimal amount of entanglement .",
    "this indicates that the difference between 1-distillable and @xmath4-undistillable or even bound entangled nppt states is very subtle .",
    "moreover , the above results show that even weakly entangled bound entangled ppt states can be useful for some quantum information processing purposes @xcite .    as the problem discussed in this paper is primarily a feasibility problem ,",
    "we have at this stage not asked for the obtained rates .",
    "in fact , one could for instance easily improve the probability of success for the used activation protocol by a factor @xmath107 by measuring in a basis of maximally entangled states and retaining the state whenever the measurement outcomes coincide . an interesting question going one step further and",
    "requiring knowledge about rates is , whether there is the possibility of _ self - activation _ after some initial activation with a limited resource took place . in other words , is it possible to yield asymptotically more entanglement from distillation than is needed for the preparation of the activator states ?",
