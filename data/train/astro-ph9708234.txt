    "ever since the pioneering studies of steady thin accretion disks by shakura & sunyaev ( 1973 , hereafter ss ) , the model of thin accretion disks has been applied successfully to low energy emission from astrophysical objects , such as dwarf novie and pre - main - sequence stars . however , the model has been less successful in modeling of high energy emission from galactic black hole candidates and active galactic nuclei which are considered to be powered by accreting black holes .",
    "the main problem lies in the fact that the thin accretion disks can not reproduce the observed spectra of such systems . the thin accretion disk model which ss originally proposed assumes that the disk is optically thick in the vertical direction and radiates the energy generated by the viscosity locally .",
    "this model predicts that the generated spectrum is multi - colored black body , which can not explain the observed power - law spectra of x - rays from agns and galactic black hole candidates even though it can explain the uv bump of the agn or the soft state spectrum of the galactic black hole candidates .",
    "more fundamentally , although it is generally believed that qsos and seyfert galaxies are powered by the gas accretion onto a super - massive black hole of the mass @xmath1 , the thin accretion disks onto such super - massive black holes are too cool to generate high energy photons which are observed in many qsos and sayfert galaxies .",
    "the model which is investigated by shapiro , lightman & eardley ( 1976 , hereafter sle ) is quite attractive in that the accreted gas is optically thin and is much hotter than that in the ss solution and is hot enough to produce high energy photons .",
    "sle considered two - temperature plasma with ions being much hotter than electrons , which enabled quantitative studies of the non - blackbody spectra .",
    "sle model has been applied to explain the spectrum of x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei successfully .",
    "however , it is known that the optically thin hot accretion disk which is considered in sle is thermally unstable ( piran 1978 ) .",
    "if the accretion disk is heated up , then the disk expands and the density decreases , so that the bremsstrahlung cooling rate decreases .",
    "the reduced cooling then causes the gas to become even hotter , leading to a runaway thermal instability . for this reason it is not likely that such hot accretion disks exist in real systems for much longer than the thermal timescale .",
    "the models introduced so far are local solutions in the sense that the heat generated via viscosity is locally radiated away efficiently , which corresponds to neglecting the advective energy transport in the energy equations .",
    "when plasma can not emit radiation efficiently , the heat generated via viscosity is advected inwards as the internal energy of the plasma .",
    "abramowicz et al . (",
    "1988 ) investigated the effect of advection term in their `` slim disk '' model in the optically thick case , and made it clear that there exists advection dominated branch where the viscous heating is balanced with the advection term rather than the radiative cooling term at high mass accretion rates .",
    "the optically thin advection dominated solution at low mass accretion rates is studied intensively by abramowicz et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and narayan & yi ( 1995 ) ( see also ichimaru 1977 , matsumoto et al . 1985 ) .",
    "although they claimed that optically thin advection dominated solution is thermally stable for the long wavelength perturbations , kato et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed the possibilities of the instability against the short wavelength perturbations .",
    "manmoto et al .",
    "( 1996 ) demonstrated that such an instability is favored for explaining rapid x - ray fluctuations from galactic black hole candidates and does not affect the global stability of the accretion flows .",
    "the optically thin advection dominated accretion flows are applied to explain the observed spectra of accreting black holes .",
    "narayan & yi ( 1995 ) investigated the self - similar solution which is used later to calculate the spectrum from several low - luminosity accreting systems with great success .",
    "as a next step , the calculations of full global steady solutions were awaited for further investigations .",
    "chen et al . ( 1997 ) solved optically thin advection dominated solution globally , but their solutions are those of one - temperature plasma and do not include detailed radiation mechanisms .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) derived global solution for optically thin advection dominated accretion flows and showed that the self - similar solution is a good approximation at the radius far enough from the outer and the inner boundaries .",
    "this means that the spectra which are derived by using the self - similar solution may be modified , because considerable amount of photons may come from the hot region near the inner boundary .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1997 ) did calculate the spectra from two - temperature accretion flows with their global solutions , but they treated the electron energy equations locally , neglecting the effect of the electron advection .",
    "nakamura et al . (",
    "1996 ) were the first to solve the energy equations for ions and electrons and obtained the global two - temperature advection dominated solutions , and showed that the temperature profiles which are crucial to the generated spectra are largely modified when the effect of electron advection is taken into account",
    ". however , nakamura et al . (",
    "1996 ) focused their attentions on the structure of the optically thin accretion disks and did not investigate the spectra from the disks .",
    "the study on the spectrum from optically thin advection dominated accretion flows with full global treatment of the basic equations is yet to be done .",
    "thus we are motivated to consistently solve full set of equations including the energy equation for ions and electrons with detailed radiation mechanisms and obtain the spectra from the optically thin accretion flows .    in section 2",
    ", we present the physical assumptions and the basic equations of our model .",
    "we show the results of our calculations in section 3 .",
    "we then apply our model to sgr a * ( the central core of our galaxy ) in section 4 .",
    "we conclude in section 5 with a summary and discussion .",
    "we consider an optically thin , steady axisymmetric accretion flow around a black hole . to investigate the spectra generated by the optically thin gas flows , we discuss gas dynamics in the context of two - temperature plasma . assuming the existence of randomly oriented magnetic fields which possibly originate from the turbulence in the gas flow , we take total pressure @xmath2 to be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gas pressure , @xmath5 is the magnetic pressure .",
    "we neglect the radiation pressure in this paper because the optically thin accretion flows we consider is always gas pressure dominated .",
    "we take the ratio of gas pressure to the total pressure as a global parameter which we designate as @xmath6 .",
    "technically we need to solve the magnetic field self - consistently with the gas dynamics , but it is beyond the scope of this paper to treat full magneto - hydrodynamics equations . due to the two - temperature assumption , we write @xmath4 as @xmath7 here and hereafter subscripts @xmath8 and @xmath9 indicate the quantities for ions and electrons , respectively . in eq .",
    "( [ eq2.2 ] ) , @xmath10 is the temperature , @xmath11 is the density , and @xmath12 is the mean molecular weight which is given by @xmath13 where numerical values correspond to the cosmic abundance .",
    "we estimate magnetic field @xmath14 via magnetic pressure by the following equation : @xmath15      we adopt cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath16,@xmath17,@xmath18 ) to describe axisymmetric ( @xmath19 ) accretion flows .",
    "basic equations which describe the dynamics of the accretion disks are those of mass conservation , euler equations which comprises three spatial components , and the energy equations .",
    "mass conservation gives @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the radial and the vertical velocity respectively .",
    "the radial component of euler equation is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the azimuthal velocity and @xmath25 is the potential energy . to simulate general relativistic effects",
    ", we adopt pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath26 with @xmath27 being the mass of the black hole , @xmath28 the schwarzschild radius , and @xmath29 the distance from the central black hole .",
    "this potential is known to represent the dynamical aspects of general relativistic effects quite well for @xmath30 ( paczyski & wiita 1980 ) and greatly simplifies the basic equations .",
    "technically we need to solve the basic equations in the schwarzschild or kerr metric especially for the photon propagation . however solving the equations including the photon propagation in the full relativisitc metric is out of the scope of current paper .",
    "azimuthal component of euler equation is the conservation of angular momentum which gives @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the @xmath33-component of the stress tensor .",
    "according to the conventional @xmath34-prescription of sheer viscosity , @xmath32 can be written as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the angular velocity and @xmath37 is the keplerian angular velocity on the equatorial plane . in our paper",
    ", we take @xmath32 to be simply proportional to the local pressure @xmath2 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the dimensionless viscosity parameter which in general is considered to be around @xmath40 .",
    "two - temperature assumption requires two energy equations i.e. one for ions and one for electrons , both of which contain advective energy transport terms .",
    "the energy equation for each species is @xmath41 @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the specific entropy , @xmath44 is the volume energy transfer rate from ions to electrons , and @xmath45 is the volume radiative cooling rate .",
    "we assume that the energy is transferred from ions to electrons via coulomb collisions only .",
    "stepney & guilbert ( 1983 ) give an explicit expression : @xmath46      \\end{array }      \\label{eq2.12}\\ ] ] where the @xmath47 s are modified bessel functions , @xmath48 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath49 is the dimensionless temperature .",
    "note that the energy equations assume that the ions and the electrons are in thermal equilibrium by some mechanisms .",
    "the thermodynamic relations are @xmath50 @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the adiabatic index . in the energy equations",
    "we have assumed viscous heating acts only on ions because an ion particle is much heavier than an electron particle .",
    "now we have full set of basic equations which describe the steady accretion flow around a black hole .",
    "however , it is rather a difficult problem to solve above partial differential equations with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath18 plus radiative transfer equations to obtain global steady solutions . to lessen the number of variables",
    ", we fix the vertical structure before we solve the full spatial equations , assuming the accretion flow is geometrically thin .",
    "the validity of the assumption that the disk is geometrically thin will be discussed later . as a first order approximation , we adopt isothermal structure in the vertical direction , which means that the sound velocity @xmath53 is independent of @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we also assume radial and azimuthal velocities are independent of @xmath18 .",
    "the vertical structure is obtained analytically by solving the remaining vertical component of euler equation which represents hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction : @xmath54 the last equation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.15 ] ) assumes that the disk is geometrically thin .",
    "the density distribution in the vertical direction is @xmath55 here , h is the vertical scale height defined by @xmath56 with the vertical structure given above , we can now integrate above basic equations in the vertical direction and rewrite them as follows .",
    "mass conservation now gives @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the surface density .",
    "we have taken @xmath21 to be positive for the inward flow so that the mass accretion rate @xmath59 takes positive value",
    ". the height - integrated version of the radial component of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.6 ] ) is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the height - integrated pressure .",
    "the last term of the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.19 ] ) corresponds to the correction for the decrease of the radial component of gravitational force away from the equatorial plane ( matsumoto et al .",
    "we can integrate the conservation of angular momentum ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq2.8 ] ] ) with respect to @xmath16 as well as @xmath18 and obtain following simple equation : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the specific angular momentum swallowed by the central black hole .",
    "the energy equations ( eq .",
    "[ [ eq2.10 ] ] , [ [ eq2.11 ] ] ) are vertically integrated together with the thermodynamic relations ( eq . [ [ eq2.13 ] ] , [ [ eq2.14 ] ] ) and now can be written as @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the energy transfer rate from ions to electrons per unit surface area .",
    "@xmath67 is the radiative cooling rate per unit surface area which will be explicitly given in the next subsection .",
    "the energy equations can be written compactly as follows : @xmath68 @xmath69      following the work of narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , we consider three processes for radiative cooling : bremsstrahlung , synchrotron radiation , and comptonization of soft photons . in order to obtain the spectrum generated by the accretion flow and the global structure of the accretion disk , we need to solve global radiation transfer problem in the radial and the vertical direction which involves self - absorption and incoherent scatterings .",
    "we treat such complicated problem in a rather simplified way : 1 ) we assume locally plane parallel gas configuration at each radius and 2 ) we separate the compton scattering process from the rest of radiation processes , i.e. emission and absorption",
    ". this will not make serious error because the gas is so tenuous that generated photons rarely experience multiple scatterings before they escape .",
    "note that at such low frequencies as radio frequencies , the effect of free - free and synchrotron self - absorption is so large that the disk can not be considered optically thin , while the optical depth for scatterings is constant at all frequencies .",
    "we first estimate the spectrum of unscattered photons at given radius by solving radiative diffusion equation in the vertical direction .",
    "for the isothermal plane parallel gas atmosphere where density configuration is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq2.16 ] ) the radiative diffusion equation can be solved and gives the energy flux @xmath70 of the unscattered photons at given radius ( see appendix b ) : @xmath71 ,      \\label{eq2.24}\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the optical depth for absorption of the accretion flow in the vertical direction with @xmath73 being the absorption coefficient on the equatorial plane . assuming lte , we can write @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the emissivity . note that equation ( [ eq2.24 ] ) includes the effects of free - free absorption and synchrotron self - absorption at low frequencies .      in our model ,",
    "electron temperature exceeds rest mass energy of an electron in some cases where electron - electron bremsstrahlung is important as well as electron - proton bremsstrahlung which dominates electron - electron bremsstrahlung in the classical temperature regime .",
    "thus the cooling rate per unit volume for bremsstrahlung is @xmath76 following narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , we employ @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the fine - structure constant and @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 @xmath81\\quad for\\;\\theta _ e>1 ,      \\label{eq2.27}\\ ] ] and @xmath82 @xmath83 with the cooling rate given above , we can write the emissivity @xmath84 as @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the gaunt factor which is given by ( see rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath87 @xmath88      for the relativistic temperatures for the electrons , and in the presence of magnetic field which is of the same order as equipartition magnetic field , synchrotron emission is also very important . following narayan & yi ( 1995 ) , the optically thin synchrotron emissivity by a relativistic maxwellian distribution of electrons is @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given by @xmath91      we proceed to consider the effect of compton scattering .",
    "we make use of the idea of energy enhancement factor which is derived by dermer , liang , & canfield ( 1991 ) and modified in part by esin et al .",
    "the energy enhancement factor @xmath92 is defined as the average energy boost of a photon .",
    "the prescription for @xmath92 is @xmath93+\\eta _ {",

    ". equation ( [ eq2.32 ] ) gives the correct estimate for the optical depth for scattering in the presence of the absorption .",
    "note that the simple treatment given above assumes that the cross - section is thomson cross - section rather than exact klein - nishina cross - section . with the energy enhancement factor @xmath92 , the local radiative cooling rate @xmath99 is given by @xmath100 we calculate the radiative cooling rate numerically and use it for the energy equation for electrons at each radius to calculate the global solution of the accretion flows .",
    "we need more detailed specification for the calculation of the spectrum . knowing the spectrum of unscattered photons and the probability that a photon will suffer scattering given times",
    ", we can calculate the compton scattered spectrum if we know the information about how the original spectrum is modified after experiencing one scattering . note that the average energy boost given in ( [ eq2.31 ] ) is the energy boost _ averaged _ over the maxwellian distribution of electrons and can not be used directly for the spectrum calculations .",
    "such problem was precisely discussed first by jones ( 1968 ) and corrected afterwards by coppi & blandford ( 1990 ) .",
    "we make use of the formula given by coppi & blandford ( 1990 ) and calculate the resulting spectrum .",
    "the remaining problem concerning compton scattering is how to treat the spectrum of the saturated comptonized photons .",
    "we assume that photons which are scattered more than @xmath101 times saturate and obey the wien distribution @xmath102 .",
    "since large fraction of the emitted radiation is generated at the radius fairly close to the black holes in our model , we can not ignore the effect of redshift due to the gravity and the gas motion .",
    "we include the gravitational redshift by simply taking the ratio of the energy of a photon when observed to its energy emitted at radius r to be @xmath103 .",
    "to treat redshift due to relativistic gas motion in a simple way , we concentrate on the face - on case where the optically thin assumption is most adequate . thus we simply take the ratio of energy change for the redshift due to gas motion to be @xmath104 .",
    "we solve numerically the set of equations given so far with the boundary conditions .",
    "the outer boundary conditions imposed are @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 at @xmath108 . here",
    "@xmath109 is the virial temperature defined by @xmath110 we did not set the angular velocity to be the keplerian angular velocity itself at the outer boundary for simply technical reasons .",
    "we need to set somewhat sub - keplerian disk at the outer boundary so that the viscous heating term take positive value with the simple viscosity prescription adopted in this paper [ eq . ( [ eq2.9 ] ) ] .",
    "we confirmed that the outer boundary condition have little effect on the structure of the inner advection - dominated flows .",
    "there have been many suggestions about how outer keplerian disks are connected to the advection dominated disks .",
    "for instance , honma ( 1996 ) took into account the effect of thermal conductivity and obtained the global solutions where the outer cool keplerian disk is connected to the inner hot optically thin disk .",
    "however the mechanism of the transition is not yet clear .",
    "the free parameters in the set of equations are @xmath39 , @xmath6 , @xmath27 , @xmath59 , and @xmath63 .",
    "these five parameters are not independent because of the transonic nature of the equations .",
    "@xmath63 can be determined uniquely so that the solution should satisfy the transonic condition when the remaining parameters are given .",
    "we have to adjust @xmath63 recursively to obtain smooth transonic solutions , since the location of the transonic point is not known until we obtain global transonic solutions .",
    "to discuss the general properties of our model , we set @xmath111 and @xmath112 where @xmath113 and assign typical values for other parameters : @xmath114 , @xmath115 ( case of equipartition ) . to demonstrate how the heatings and coolings balance in the energy equations , we show figure 1 the @xmath116 s for the ions ( upper panel ) , and for the electrons ( lower panel ) ; ( see eq . [ [ eq2.23 ] ] ) .",
    "the solid line in the upper panel shows the ratio of advective cooling of ions to the viscous heating , which is commonly denoted by @xmath117 .",
    "we have @xmath118 for the purely advection dominated accretion flows and @xmath119 for the purely radiative cooling dominated accretion flows .",
    "we see that @xmath117 asymptotically approaches unity as the radius decreases .",
    "we use the region @xmath120 to investigate the spectrum from the optically thin advection dominated accretion flows .",
    "we see from figure 1 that the accretion flows becomes highly advection dominated in the region @xmath121 where the heat transport from ions to electrons by the coulomb coupling practically becomes zero .",
    "the interesting point is that it is electron advective _ heating _ , rather than the heat supplied from the ions , that balances with the radiative cooling of electrons , which means the electron accretion flow becomes cooling flow near the central black hole where the electrons are cooled by consuming the stored internal energy to radiate before being heated up by the ions ( cf .",
    "nakamura et al .",
    "many analyses concerning two - temperature accretion flows have adopted simplified energy equation for electrons : @xmath122 .",
    "our results shows that above simplified energy equation is inadequate for the analysis of two - temperature advection dominated flows and one should adopt @xmath123 instead .",
    "figure 2 shows the ion and electron temperature profiles .",
    "we see that the electron temperature is heated up to @xmath124 .",
    "although we need to include the effect of electron - positron pair production and annihilation for such hot accretion flows , we make simple assumption that the pair density is very low ( see discussion in esin et al . 1996 , bjornsson et al .",
    "1996 , kusunose & mineshige 1996 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the aspect ratio @xmath125 of the accretion flow .",
    "we have used height - integrated equations for our calculations which neglect the higher order of @xmath125 .",
    "we may conclude that the value of @xmath125 shown in figure 3 is marginally safe for the height integration .",
    "however , of course , the vertical structure of the advection dominated accretion flows is an important issue and we will investigate it in future papers .",
    "figure 4 shows the angular momentum and the various velocities as a function of the radius @xmath16 . here",
    "@xmath126 is defined as @xmath127 so that @xmath128 at the critical point .",
    "we see from the figure 4 that the radial dependence of the radial and the azimuthal velocities are different from that of the self - similar solutions , in which all the velocities are proportional to @xmath129 , especially in the super - sonic region .",
    "we see that for the parameters given above , the azimuthal velocity @xmath24 is fairly sub - keplerian and even sub - sonic and of the same order as the radial velocity @xmath21 unlike the standard model , which is known to be a common feature for @xmath114 .",
    "( in the standard model , we have @xmath130 . )",
    "note that we have ` sub - sonic ' azimuthal velocity when the rotation is highly sub - keplerian ( @xmath131 ) and the disk is hot and geometrically thick ( @xmath132 ) . for the reason that the radial velocity @xmath21 is the same order as the azimuthal velocity @xmath24",
    ", we call the accreting gas `` accretion flow '' rather than to call `` accretion disk '' in this paper .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the luminosity distribution as a function of @xmath16 .",
    "the contributions from respective radiation mechanisms ( i.e. bremsstrahlung , synchrotron , comptonization ) are also shown .",
    "we see that the bremsstrahlung emission is important and the effect of the synchrtron emmision and the comptonization is negligibly small in the outer region of the accretion flow ( @xmath133 ) , while the synchrotron emission and the comptonization dominate in the hot inner region ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the contribution of the comptonization rapidly increases as the radius decreases because the amount of the synchrotron soft photons increases and not because the compton @xmath135-parameter @xmath136 increases .",
    "note that in the innermost region the electron temperature @xmath137 is approximately constant and the surface density decreases and thereby @xmath135 actually decreases .",
    "note that almost all emission comes from the hot inner region ( @xmath134 ) and the fraction of the emission from the super - sonic region , which the self - similar solutions fail to describe accurately , is fairly large .",
    "as far as the bremsstrahlung is concerned , the contribution of the emission from the large radii is not negligible , which make the slope of the bremsstrahlung spectrum less steep , since what we observe is the superposition of the bremsstrahlung peaks from different radii .    in figure 6",
    ", we shows the spectrum generated by the optically thin accretion flows .",
    "parameters are @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 . s indicates the synchrotron peak which is composed of rayleigh - jeans slope and the optically thin synchrotron emission .",
    "c1 and c2 indicate the once and twice compton scattered photons , respectively .",
    "b indicates the bremsstrahlung emission plus photons suffering multiple compton scattering .",
    "w indicates saturated comptonized photons which form wien tail .",
    "the upper panel of figure 7 shows the surface density of the accretion flow .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the case with the central black hole mass of @xmath140 .",
    "we find that the structure of the accretion flow is nearly the same when the radius and the mass accretion rate are scaled with the schwarzschild radius and the critical mass accretion rate , respectively .",
    "however we see in the lower panel of the figure 7 that the electron temperature at the innermost region is varied slightly .",
    "this is due to the fact that the accretion flow is highly advection dominated .",
    "we remind the readers that the viscous heating is balanced almost entirely with the advective cooling in the ion energy equation and there is little coupling between the ions and the electrons .",
    "thus the structure of the accretion flow is governed by ion energy equation while the electron energy equation including the radiative cooling is decoupled and determines the electron temperature . although the height - integrated quantities are the same when the radius is scaled with the schwarzschild radius , the amount of radiative cooling , which is the function of the density distribution rather than the height - integrated quantities , is different .",
    "thus we have different electron temperatures for different black hole masses .",
    "we show the spectrum from the accretion flow for the @xmath141 case in figure 8 .",
    "the shape of the spectrum is essentially the same as the @xmath142 case , but the position of the synchrotron peak and the absolute luminosity differs considerably .",
    "following up on the successful work of narayan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) which applied the advection dominated model to the sgr a * ( the central core of our galaxy ) , we improve their model by fully solving the basic equations to explain the observed emission from radio frequencies to gamma - rays . figure 9 shows the model which explains observed radio and x - ray data quite well .",
    "the parameters assigned are given in the figure .",
    "the points and the short lines are the observational data , which assume interstellar absorption @xmath143 and a distance @xmath144 , both typical for the galactic center , compiled by narayan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ( references therein ) .",
    "the various lines correspond to the different values of mass accretion rate which varies by factor of 2 .",
    "as narayan et al . noticed , the position of the rayleigh - jeans slope is determined solely by the mass of the central black hole . thus to give a good fit to the observed radio emission with our model , we have no choice but to fix the mass of the central black hole to be @xmath0 . considering the inaccuracy of the potential at the innermost region of the accretion flow ,",
    "this value is consistent with the value which is derived from the gas and stellar dynamics ( genzel & townes 1987 ) .",
    "we have @xmath145 for the black hole of the mass @xmath0 , hence the predicted mass accretion rate is @xmath146 .",
    "figure 9 also illustrates the @xmath147 dependence of our model .",
    "the surface density sensitively depends on @xmath147 , while the temperature is fairly insensitive to @xmath147 .",
    "thus the luminosity at all frequencies decreases when we reduce the mass accretion rate .",
    "we find that if we change the mass accretion rate by a factor of @xmath148 , x - ray luminosity varies by the same factor while the synchrotron peak varies little .",
    "we suggest that the various x - ray data seemingly inconsistent with each other are purely due to the change of the mass accretion rate of the accretion flow .",
    "there have been an argument that the x - ray luminosity of sgr a * is variable on the timescale of half a year , which is consistent with our suggestion .",
    "figure 10 illustrates how the spectrum changes with different black hole masses . as we mentioned before ,",
    "the structure of the accretion flow is the same with proper scalings , but the electron temperature is slightly different because of the difference of the emissivity .",
    "we see clearly that the position of the rayleigh - jeans slope is determined by the mass of the central black hole .",
    "we show in figure 11 the @xmath6-dependence of the structure of the accretion flow and the spectrum .",
    "we remind the readers that the parameter @xmath6 is defined as the ratio of the gas pressure to the total pressure .",
    "we have the stronger magnetic field for the smaller value of @xmath6 .",
    "unlike the other parameter dependence , the ion temperature as well as the electron temperature decreases when we lower the value of @xmath6 .",
    "this is reasonable because for the lower value of @xmath6 , the stronger becomes the magnetic pressure and the gas pressure can be smaller to support the accretion flow .",
    "this temperature change has a large effect on the bremsstrahlung spectrum but has little effect on the synchrotron peak , which is because the effects of the stronger ( weaker ) magnetic field and the lower ( higher ) temperature roughly cancel out .",
    "we set @xmath149 at the outer boundary for @xmath150 since we could not find advection dominated solution for @xmath150 with @xmath151 .",

    "( 1995 ) did not investigate the parameter dependence of the viscosity parameter @xmath39 and the mass accretion rate @xmath147 independently , since they used simplified disk model , in which @xmath39 and @xmath147 can not be chosen independently .",
    "thus it is meaningful to study the @xmath39 dependence of the spectrum .",
    "we show in figure 12 the @xmath39-dependence of our model . when @xmath39 is large , the angular momentum is extracted efficiently and the surface density decreases , which makes the bremsstrahlung emission weak .",
    "however , the increase of the electron temperature at the innermost region makes the synchrotron emission stronger .",
    "we find that the width of the synchrotron peak is the most sensitive to the value of @xmath39 .",
    "the upper limits in the radio frequency band imposes strong restriction upon the value of @xmath39 for the case of sgr a*. for instance , we can not fit the entire spectrum with @xmath114 .",
    "we have to set @xmath152 to explain entire spectrum of sgr a * with our model .",
    "this fact is important because it is claimed that @xmath153 in advection - dominated accretion flows on various grounds ( see discussions in narayan 1996 ) .",
    "if we are to set @xmath114 , we have to reduce the mass accretion rate by factor of 4 so as to give a good fit to the observed radio and ir spectrum ( see figure 12 ) . in that case",
    ", we can not explain the x - ray emission from the galactic center .",
    "various x - ray observations have found the x - ray sources at the galactic center but the angular resolution has been insufficient to identify a source with the radio source sgr a*. there remains the possibility that x - rays do not come from sgr a * at all ( e.g. see duschl et al .",
    "if that is the case , all the x - ray data are merely upper limits and the accretion flows with @xmath114 do not conflict with the observations .",
    "there exist some data points in near ir and radio frequencies which can not be accounted for .",
    "however , it is natural to think that there must be dust region or stellar contamination or non - thermal objects like jets in central region of our galaxy overlapping the accreting black hole which in total we observe as a point source sgr a*. in that sense , one should consider the observational data as upper limits .",
    "a point worth emphasizing here is that the entire spectrum of sgr a * is basically explained with an optically thin accretion flow around a black hole of the mass @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we have solved globally the basic equations including the gas dynamics and the radiation processes consistently rather than to consider more primitive models like isothermal gas complex of certain size .",
    "in this paper , we have calculated the global structure of optically thin advection dominated accretion flows in the context of two - temperature plasma , adopting the full set of basic equations including the energy equation for the electrons .",
    "we have also calculated the spectra emitted by the optically thin accretion flows which we calculated .",
    "we have made the calculation of the spectra and that of the structure of the accretion flows to be completely consistent by calculating the radiative cooling rate at each radius by numerically integrating the whole spectrum emitted at the radius .    as a result of the advection domination for the ions ,",
    "the heat transport from the ions to the electrons becomes practically zero and the radiative cooling balances with the advective _ heating _ of the electrons .",
    "this means that the electron cools itself by releasing the stored internal energy as a radiation .",
    "hence the energy equation for the electrons play an important role for the calculation of the spectra , where the temperature profile of the electron is the important factor .    an interesting feature of the advection dominated flow , which is known already , is that the azimuthal velocity becomes highly sub - keplerian and of the same order as the radial velocity and the sound velocity .",
    "the point worth noting is that in the innermost hot luminous region , the divergence of the velocities from those in the self - similar solution is fairly large .",
    "the accreting gas becomes very hot .",
    "the electron temperature even exceeds the rest mass energy of an electron .",
    "we have not taken into account the effect of the pair production and the annihilation , which is an important issue .",
    "for such hot accretion flows , the synchrotron emission and the compton scattering are very important .",
    "the spectrum is composed by 1 ) the synchrotron peak which comprises optically thin synchrotron emission and the self - absorbed rayleigh - jeans slope and 2 ) the unsaturated comptonized photons which forms some bumps and 3 ) the bremsstrahlung emission and 4)the saturated comptonized photons .",
    "the dependence of the each component on the model parameters is complex . among them ,",
    "the position of the rayleigh - jeans slope is almost solely determined by the mass of the central black hole .",
    "when we make the magnetic field stronger , the temperature of the entire flow decreases , which has significant effect on the comptonization and the bremsstrahlung emission , but has little effect on the synchrotron emission .",
    "when we make the viscosity smaller , the surface density increases and the bremsstrahlung emission increases , but the synchrotron emission and the comptonization decreases . the simplest relation is the dependence on the mass accretion rate . when we reduce the mass accretion rate , the entire emission is reduced .",
    "however the bremsstrahlung emission is much more sensitive to the change of the mass accretion rate than the synchrotron emission .",
    "we find that the spectrum of sgr a * is explained by the optically thin advection dominated accretion flow around a black hole of the mass @xmath0 .",
    "narayan et al .",
    "( 1995 ) also calculated the spectrum of sgr a * using an optically thin advection dominated accretion flow model .",
    "their best fit parameters are different from ours .",
    "for instance the mass of the central black hole is @xmath154 according to their model .",
    "the different points in our model are 1 ) full global treatment of the basic equations and 2 ) inclusion of the electron energy equation and 3 ) calculation of the innermost region where the flow is supersonic and the effects of the redshift are important .",
    "2 ) and 3 ) have very important effect on the emitted spectrum , which is not considered in narayan et al .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray data obtained by various satellite observations are explained by the variation of the mass accretion rate by a factor of @xmath155 , if we allow @xmath39 to have small value . if we set @xmath153 , which is considered to be a standard value for the advection dominated accretion flows , it is not likely that the x - rays come from sgr a*.    we have computed the model using height - integrated equations with fixed structure in the vertical direction .",
    "we have also adopted simplified form of equations for the radiation field .",
    "our immediate goal is to solve the basic equations including equations for the radiation field in at least two dimensional space .",
    "however , our successful result presented in this paper tells us that the basic idea is correct .",
    "the full treatment of schwarzschild or kerr metric is also an important issue .",
    "we thank professor shoji kato for useful discussions , and ann esin and jun fukue for useful comments .",
    "we are very grateful to r. narayan for providing us with a code to calculate inverse - compton spectra .",
    "we thank the referee j. p. lasota for many valuable comments and suggestions .",
    "in this paper , we have adopted the height - integrated equations to obtain the structure of the optically thin advection dominated accretion flows .",
    "we have seen that the temperature of the accretion flows is very high and the aspect ratio @xmath125 is @xmath156 . thus the height - integration may not be an excellent approximation since the operation of the height - integration omits the higher orders of @xmath125 .",
    "thus we consider it useful to describe in detail the operation of the height - integration to discuss the reliability of our calculations .",
    "the potential we adopted is spherically symmetric , while we adopt the cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "thus we need to expand it around the equatorial plane ( @xmath157 ) in order to integrate the basic equations in the vertical direction . in the case of",
    "geometrically thin accretion flows , we can neglect the terms containing the higher orders of @xmath158 and the operation of the height - integration becomes very simple .",
