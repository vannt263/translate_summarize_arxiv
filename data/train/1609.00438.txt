    "the remaining couplings are very weak and ferromagnetic ( fm ) .",
    "the overall microscopic picture of the magnetism in ba@xmath0cusi@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 provided by density functional calculations is therefore very similar to that of bacusi@xmath0o@xmath1  @xcite , where interdimer coupling @xmath115 connects spins belonging to distinct atomic planes forming the bilayer .",
    "furthermore , the presence of weak fm couplings between adjacent spins belonging to the same atomic plane or between the bilayers implies the absence of obvious frustration , in contrast to the case of ba@xmath0cosi@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented the first structural analysis , magnetization and magnetoelastic measurements on ba@xmath0cusi@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 .",
    "the magnetic susceptibilities and magnetization curves for different field directions coincide almost perfectly when normalized by the respective @xmath3-factors , which indicates that the magnetic anisotropy is very small .",
    "the observed magnetization data are excellently reproduced using exact - diagonalization computations based on the 2d coupled dimer model illustrated in fig .",

    "the 2d exchange model was also confirmed by dft .",
    "thus , ba@xmath0cusi@xmath0o@xmath1cl@xmath0 closely approximates the ideal 2d dimerized heisenberg quantum magnet .",
    "the quantum critical behavior near both critical fields @xmath172 and the nature of the spin state above @xmath94 are of great interest and currently under investigation .",
