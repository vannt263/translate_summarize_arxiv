    "an attractor in classical dynamics is , colloquially speaking , a ( invariant ) set of points to which all trajectories starting in its neighborhood ( more precisely , its basin of attraction ) converge .",
    "more precisely , an attractor can be defined as a closed set @xmath0 with the following properties @xcite .",
    "first , @xmath0 is an invariant set : any trajectory @xmath1 that starts in @xmath0 stays in @xmath0 for all time .",
    "secondly , @xmath0 attracts an open set of initial conditions : there is an open set @xmath2 containing @xmath0 such that if @xmath3 , then the distance from @xmath1 to @xmath0 tends to zero as @xmath4 .",
    "this means that @xmath0 attracts all trajectories that start sufficiently close to it .",
    "the largest such @xmath2 is called the basin of attraction of @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the fact that volumes have to be conserved in conservative systems implies immediately that they display no attracting regions in phase space @xcite .",
    "however , a quasidissipative property has been reported in a combined map , namely a piecewise smooth area - preserving map which models an electronic relaxation oscillator with over - voltage protection @xcite .",
    "the quasidissipative property eventually converts initial sets into attracting sets , which was correspondingly referred to as the formation of a quasiattractor . as a result",
    ", this system behaves partly dissipative ( outside the quasiattractor , i.e. before trajectories have reached the quasiattractor ) and partly conservative ( inside the quasiattractor ) . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the existence of quasiattractors has been observed so far only in the piecewise smooth area - preserving map . in this paper",
    "we show that coupled dielectric cavities are another system class with this property .",
    "each optical interface is characterized by the splitting of an incoming ray into transmitted and reflected rays which is repeated at each reflection point . for optical systems consisting of more than one dielectric building block such as the combination of two disks",
    ", the ray splitting dynamics is especially complicated . a ray model with deterministic selection rule ( rmds )",
    "was proposed @xcite to effectively describe the resulting dynamics .",
    "its justification is underlined by a nice agreement with wave calculations @xcite .",
    "a noticeable and characteristic property of ray dynamics in the rmds is that all initial rays eventually arrive in a certain region of phase space - namely an island structure @xcite . in other words , attractors occur .",
    "their existence is , on the one hand , a surprise because the underlying ray dynamics is hamiltonian . on the other hand ,",
    "wave solutions for the individual resonant modes are precisely localized on these emerging ( quasiattractor ) structures , and ray - wave correspondence is fully established .",
    "we shall see below in sec .",
    "[ sec_iii ] that it is the special structure of the selection rule , namely the coupling of different maps , that induces the quasiattracting features .    in this paper",
    ", we study the characteristics of quasiattractors emerging from simple coupled maps in order to gain a heuristic understanding of attracting phenomena . to this end",
    ", we introduce in sec .",
    "[ sec_ii ] a toy model - a combination of standard and linear mappings - that clearly demonstrates the existence of the quasiattracting phenomenon and its origin . in sec .",
    "[ sec_iii ] we apply the insight gained to the optical system consisting of two dielectric disks , and explicitly show the mapping rules and their relation to the quasiattractor .",
    "we use the dependence of the selection rule on the refractive index of the disks in order to illustrate the parametric dependence of the emerging structures .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec_iv ] .",
    "in order to understand the appearance of quasiattractors , we introduce a map that combines the well - known standard and linear maps as an example of a piecewise smooth area - preserving map discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite as origin of quasidissipative behaviour .",
    "the standard map is , physically speaking , a discrete - time analogue of the equation of the vertical pendulum and a prototype two - dimensional map commonly used in the study of various nonlinear phenomena of conservative systems @xcite .",
    "it is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the angle of rotation , @xmath7 is the conjugate momentum , @xmath8 is a positive parameter which determines the dynamics of the map , and @xmath9 is a subset of phase space introduced in connection with the selection rule . equation  ( [ eq1 ] ) is the usual standard map if we exclude the selection rule , i.e. , apply the map to all @xmath10 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "the momentum is constant and the angle increases linearly . as @xmath8 increases , the phase space becomes increasingly chaotic as can be seen in the poincar surface of sections ( psoss ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . for @xmath12 , cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) , one ( split ) island of stability remains , whereas all islands have disappeared for @xmath13 , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( d ) .",
    "in addition to the standard map we introduce a linear map with parameters @xmath14 that has to be determined when @xmath15 , @xmath16     and ( d ) @xmath13 .",
    "different color sets represent those from different initial points .",
    "the psos of the combined standard - linear map ; ( b , c ) for @xmath12 and ( e , f ) for @xmath13 .",
    "the region a is denoted as the red solid box in ( b ) .",
    "the region b , denoted as the dashed green box , is chosen as ( b , e ) @xmath17 and ( c ) @xmath18 .",
    "( f ) forward iterated sets starting from the region a using only the standard map .",
    "red , green , and blue sets represent the first , second , and third iterated sets , respectively . ]",
    "each dynamics of standard maps and linear maps have been well understood for many years , but the dynamics of the combined map is not the case .",
    "the region @xmath19 and @xmath20 is chosen for a , indicated by the red box in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( b ) .",
    "with @xmath21 the region a is mapped into the region b represented by the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) via the linear map ( 2 ) . after some transient time",
    ", for @xmath12 the initial distribution uniformly prepared over the whole phase space converges into the island structure as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) . this behavior can be easily understood as follows .",
    "the points starting from the regions outside the converging islands eventually reach the regions a due to ergodicity of chaotic dynamics .",
    "some points of a are mapped into the islands according to the linear mapping of ( 2 ) since the region b contains the islands .",
    "once the points are put on the converging islands , they can not escape from the islands since it forms an invariant set .",
    "if they are not put on the islands , they chaotically wander again until they are mapped into the islands .",
    "therefore , the whole phase space converges to the islands as time goes on so that the islands form a quasiattractor @xcite .    the structure of the ( quasi)attractor depends on where the region a and b are located . when b is chosen as the dashed box shown in fig.1  ( c ) with @xmath22 , the quasiattractor consists of the chaotic components as well as the islands .",
    "the chaotic part resembles a usual strange attractor of dissipative systems @xcite .",
    "its structure will be discussed in detail below .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "no stable islands exist in the standard map .",
    "after some transient time , a fractal quasiattractor emerges for @xmath23 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) . in order to understand the detailed structure of the fractal quasiattractor ,",
    "let us consider the evolution of the region a only by the standard map ( 1 ) .",
    "the first , second , and third iterations of the region a are denoted as red , green , and blue areas in fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) , respectively , which shows a typical stretching and folding structure of chaotic dynamics .",
    "due to the linear map ( 2 ) , the region a can not follow such an evolution but is compulsorily mapped into b by ( 2 ) .",
    "it means that the final attracting structure is likely to lack the areas generated by chaotic evolution of the region a. in fact , the empty area of fig .",
    "[ fig1](e ) looks quite similar to the collection of the first , the second , and the third iterations of the region a shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1](f ) .",
    "note that this argument is only true for a short time evolution .",
    "however , the dissipative nature of our system guarantees that the short time dynamics is enough to understand its main feature .",
    "this mechanism can also be applied to fig .",
    "[ fig1](c ) although the island part is dealt with separately .",
    "the fractal quasiattractors shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) and ( e ) form an invariant set with a non - zero measure , which is called a fat fractal .",
    "as a parameter such as the location of the region b varies , the fractal quasiattractor loses its stability and at the same time the island suddenly becomes an attractor .",
    "this is a typical characteristic of the so - called crisis bifurcation @xcite .",
    "it is known that forming a quasiattractor the phase space decreases on average linearly in time rather than exponentially @xcite .",
    "the coupled dielectric cavities , schematically shown in fig .  2 , have a prominent feature @xcite ; when the ray escapes from the cavity , it may either go to the infinity or collide with the other cavity so as to enter it .",
    "for the former case we force the ray to be reflected back into the original cavity rather than allowing the ray to escape from the system .",
    "for the latter case there exists a finite probability that the ray can also be reflected from the surface of the other cavity .",
    "however , the ray is then forced to enter the cavity according to the rules set up in the rmds .",
    "these forced operations play a role of the linear map ( 2 ) in the previous section .",
    "this shows how the rmds works .",
    "although this model is simple , it notably possesses the main feature of a quasiattractor that we introduced in the previous section : the rays forcibly reflected back into the cavity , otherwise escaping from the cavity , indeed form quasiattracting islands .",
    "moreover they are shown to be directly associated with resonant modes obtained from wave calculation .    in this section ,",
    "we provide how the rmds of two coupled dielectric disks is related to the coupled standard - linear map introduced in the previous section .",
    "we mostly exploit the results obtained from the scattering problem of two disk hard wall billiard outside the cavity @xcite with snell s law to incorporate the transmission across the cavity boundaries .",
    "and @xmath24 increases in the counterclockwise direction , while in the right the opposite is true .",
    "for example , in this figure , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are positive and @xmath24 and @xmath29 are negative . @xmath30 and @xmath31 is the radius of the left and the right disk , respectively , and @xmath32 is the distance between two disks .",
    "@xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the indices of refraction of the left disk , the right disk and the outside , respectively . ]",
    "two coupled disks schematically shown in fig .  2 are described by geometric parameters , @xmath31 , @xmath30 , and @xmath32 , which denote the radius of the right and the left disk , and the inter - disk distance , respectively , and by material parameters , namely the index of refraction of the right ( @xmath34 ) and the left ( @xmath33 ) disks . for simplicity",
    "we set @xmath36 , with the index of refraction of the medium outside the cavities , @xmath35 .",
    "the ray dynamics is traced by using birkoff coordinate of ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 denote the azimuthal angle and the angle of incidence in the right ( left ) disk , respectively .",
    "notice that the sign of these angles are defined differently ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "the deterministic selection rule @xcite is given as follows .",
    "for the sake of convenience , we assume the two disks are identical , i.e. , @xmath39 which allows us to find an analytic formulation of the problem",
    ". we will also consider what happens when two disks are not identical below .",
    "first of all , if the incident angle @xmath6 is larger than the critical angle @xmath40 , rays are totally reflected from the boundary and thus can not escape from the disk .",
    "transmission of rays from one disk to the other is possible only when @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , the escaped ray can arrive at the other disk only if @xmath42 is satisfied . as a matter of fact",
    ", the precise condition that the ray can be transmitted from one disk to the other is obtained by considering a simple geometry @xcite and the snell s law as follows @xmath43 where @xmath44 with @xmath45 where @xmath46 .",
    "the area of phase space satisfying the condition ( 3 ) is marked by brown color in fig .",
    "3 and referred to as the outgoing area ( also called the region c ) .",
    "the rays located in the outgoing area of one cavity are directly mapped into the corresponding area of phase space of the other cavity , which is called the incoming area marked by yellow color in fig .",
    "3 . this constitutes the heart of the selection rule playing an equivalent role of the linear map ( 2 ) in that the outgoing and the incoming area directly correspond to the region a and b of the linear map ( 2 ) , respectively .",
    "the incoming area should form mirror image of the outgoing area due to the time - reversal symmetry and the reflection symmetry of the system .",
    ", ( b ) @xmath47 , ( c ) @xmath48 , and ( d ) @xmath49 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . the right insets of ( a)-(c ) represent the corresponding enlarged psos of the part of the islands designated by the green boxes .",
    "the left insets represent the trajectories in real space corresponding to ( a)-(c ) the torus denoted as the thick red curve in the islands and ( d ) the chaotic quasiattractor . the outgoing ( also called the region c ) and the incoming area are represented as brown ( dark gray ) and yellow ( light gray ) area , respectively .",
    "they are symmetric over @xmath52 and @xmath53 due to the symmetric geometry shown in fig .  2 . ]    for completeness , we provide the full details of the map .",
    "let us consider first the case that the rays stay within one of the disks .",
    "this is called the inside - disk dynamics , which is determined by the following simple mapping , @xmath54    when the ray enters the outgoing area of one disk by satisfying the condition ( 3 ) , it is transmitted to reach the other disk .",
    "this transmission of the ray from one cavity to the other is described as the mapping @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are given by @xcite @xmath58 with    @xmath59 ^ 2-(2r+d)^2 + 2r(2r+d)\\cos\\phi}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the map of rmds is thus summarized : if the condition ( 3 ) is satisfied eq .",

    "we call it two - disk map ( tdm ) .     and ( b ) @xmath48 , which are directly associated with the islands of fig .  3(b ) and ( c ) , respectively . ]",
    "we obtain psos of the tdm after some transient time for various @xmath60 and @xmath61 with @xmath50 using the uniformly distributed initial points @xmath62 in the open region , @xmath63 , of phase space .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the psoss for several @xmath60 with @xmath50 and @xmath51 , where the rays converge into the islands [ fig .",
    "3(a)-(c ) ] or the fractal structure [ fig .",
    "3(d ) ] so as to form the quasiattractors .",
    "they look similar to those found in the standard - linear map of sec.ii .",
    "figure  4(a ) and ( b ) show the patterns of two resonant modes for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively , which are obtained numerically using the boundary element method @xcite .",
    "the patterns are localized on the islands of fig .",
    "3(b ) and ( c ) , and closely resemble the ray trajectories presented in their insets .",
    "it clearly shows that the resonant modes are localized on the quasiattractors .",
    "it is noted that the psos obtained here , fig .",
    "3 , is slightly different from the usual psos in that the points are selected once the ray collides with the boundary irrespective of whether it is incident to or emerging from the boundary .",
    "usually the point is chosen only when the ray is either incident or emerging .",
    "this explains why two islands are overlapped to form x shape in fig .",
    "we will discuss this point below .",
    "as @xmath60 decreases the islands of the quasiattractors experience bifurcation ; firstly the island corresponding to the horizontal bouncing ball - like periodic orbit shown in the left insets of fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) becomes unstable so as to be split into the hexagonal shape periodic orbit shown in the left inset of fig .",
    "secondly the hexagonal periodic orbit also loses its stability to form the fractal quasiattractor as show in fig .",

    "starting from ( a ) the outgoing ( black ) and ( b ) the incoming area ( black ) . ]    the islands in fig .",
    "3(a)-(c ) consist of three parts , namely the parts in the outgoing ( @xmath64 ) , the incoming ( @xmath65 ) , and the reflection region ( @xmath66 ) in which all the ray is totally reflected in around @xmath67 .",
    "the rays starting from @xmath66 on the island quasiattractor is mapped to those in @xmath64 , and consequently to @xmath65 .",
    "this process is repeated , that is , @xmath68 . if time goes backward , outgoing and incoming rays are exchanged but the ordering rule is not affected .",
    "this means that the ray dynamics on the islands is reversible in time , in agreement with the symmetric structures of the islands .",
    "however , in the case of a fractal - chaotic quasiattractor of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( d ) , the time reversal symmetry is broken since in general there can exist two possible origins for the ray inside the cavity ; that is , one from the same cavity by reflection from the boundary and the other coming from the other cavity by refraction .",
    "as shown in the standard - linear map of the previous section , here the fractal quasiattractor also contains empty forbidden regions related to the short time successive iterations of outgoing and incoming regions .",
    "figures  [ fig5 ] ( a ) and ( b ) show the first , second , third , and fourth forward iterated sets according to eq .",
    "( [ fdisk ] ) from the outgoing and incoming areas , respectively .",
    "iterated sets of the outgoing area in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ( a ) produce the white forbidden region in fig .",

    "so far we have considered the identical disks , i.e. @xmath70 , but our results can also be applied to the case of @xmath71 .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows the psoss for various @xmath60 with @xmath72 , in which two disks are no longer identical .",
    "the psos of the left thus differs from that of the right . in fig .",
    "6 the psos is taken from the left .",
    "@xmath50 is chosen as before .",
    "the psos is calculated by ray tracing method considering rmds since the analytic expressions of tdm obtained above is only applicable for the identical disks . for @xmath48 the quasiattractor of the hexagonal - shape periodic orbit",
    "is observed at @xmath73 [ fig .",
    "3(c ) ] , but disappears at @xmath72 and the fractal quasiattractor takes place [ fig .",
    "6(c ) ] . if @xmath32 varies , the topological structure of the psoss and the quasiattractor are also changed ( not shown here ) .",
    "the variations of the structures in the psos depending on system parameters can also be explained by the stabilities of the periodic orbits obtained from their monodromy matrices @xcite .",
    "the birkoff coordinate of psos of dielectric cavities can be chosen as one of four possible components ; either the incident or the emerging ray either inside or outside cavity . as far as a single cavity",
    "is concerned , all components are basically equal to each other since they are directly interconnected by the law of reflection and the snell s law @xcite . however , in coupled dielectric cavities , every four components must be separately taken into account because of more complex ray dynamics that includes refraction and subsequent reentry into another component as well as reflection at the dielectric boundary back into the same component .",
    "( the upper row ) and @xmath49 ( the lower row ) with @xmath50 and @xmath51 . ]",
    "we therefore introduce a generalization of the psos that comprises incident and emerging rays inside and outside cavities .",

    "3 was constructed such that the points are selected once the ray collides with the boundary .",
    "it means that fig .",
    "3(b ) is the combination of fig .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) , which is the psos chosen from the incident and emerging ray inside the cavity , respectively . considering the nature of the coupled two disks , whose ray is either reflected from or transmitted through the boundary , the appropriate psos should contain both cases .",
    "this is the reason why the psoss was made in this way .",
    "the case of chaotic psoss with fractal quasiattracting structures is shown for @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 in fig .",

    "3(d ) is obtained from merging fig .",
    "7(e ) and ( f ) .",
    "these generalized psoss are also useful to study ray - wave correspondence in coupled dielectric cavities since the corresponding quasi - eigenmode obtained from wave calculation can be represented by the generalized husimi functions which also have four possible realizations in the exactly same manner @xcite .",
