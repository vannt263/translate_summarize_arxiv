    "recently , there has been much interest in the resilience of real - world networks to failure of nodes or to intentional attacks @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to determine network design guidelines which maximize the robustness of the networks to both random failures of nodes and attacks targeted on the highest degree nodes @xcite .",
    "networks with a given degree distribution may be very resilient to one type of attack but not to another .",
    "consider the simple seven node network example shown in fig .  [ ex]a .",
    "this network is relatively robust with respect to a random failure - only a failure of the central node will cause the network to fragment .",
    "thus the probability that a random failure will cause the network to fragment is only 1/7 . on the other hand",
    "the network is extremely vulnerable to a targeted attack - an attack in which the most highly connected nodes are removed first . in this simple example",
    "the probability that a targeted attack which removes one node will fragment the network is 1 !",
    "= 7.0 cm    as shown in fig .",
    "[ ex]b we can modify the network to make it more resilient to targeted attack by adding more links between the nodes on the periphery of the network . with this modification , neither a single node random failure nor a targeted attack which removes only one node can fragment the network .",
    "this increased robustness , however , comes with a cost .",
    "if we define the `` cost '' to construct and maintain a network with a given number of nodes as being proportional to the average number of links @xmath3 per node in the network , we see that the cost of the original network is 12/7 while the cost of modified network is 24/7 .",
    "so for the additional robustness we pay a factor of 2 in cost .",
    "our goal then becomes how to maximize the robustness of a network of size n nodes to both random failures and targeted attacks with the constraint that the cost remains constant .",
    "that is , the number of links remains constant but the nodes are connected in a different and more optimal way .",
    "many real world computer , social , biological and other types of networks have been found to be scale free , i.e. , they exhibit degree distributions of the form @xmath4  @xcite . for large scale free networks with exponent @xmath5 less than 3 , it has been found that , if nodes fail randomly , essentially all nodes must fail for the network to become disconnected  @xcite . on the other hand , because the scale free distribution has a long power - law tail ( i.e. hubs with large degree ) , the networks are vulnerable with respect to targeted attack .",
    "this raises two questions that we address in this work : ( i ) how can we optimize scale free networks to both random failure and targeted attack and ( ii ) are there other network types that can be better optimized than scale free networks . to this end , we begin our analysis with scale free networks and then consider networks with other types of distributions .",
    "the threshold for random removal of nodes for any degree distribution , @xmath6 , is @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 .",
    "reference @xcite describes how to calculate @xmath9 , the threshold under intentional attack .",
    "a metric we can use to measure the robustness of the network to both random and targeted attack is the sum @xmath10 this is only one of a number of possible metrics we could use , e.g. , we could have used the product @xmath11 .",
    "our results are , in general , not dependent on the metric chosen .",
    "our goal can now be stated as follows : for a network of a given number of nodes @xmath2 , how do we maximize @xmath12 while keeping the number of links constant ?",
    "we can estimate an upper bound for @xmath12 .",
    "we first note that the maximum value of @xmath13 is essentially 1 which is the case when a small number of nodes have a very large degree distribution  as in scale free networks with @xmath14 or in the simplest case where one node is linked to all other nodes . in these cases",
    "the probability of these critical nodes randomly failing approaches zero and the threshold is close to 1 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath9 is obtained in the situation in which all the nodes have the same degree , @xmath3 , in which case the targeted attack becomes equivalent to random failure and we can use eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) to find @xmath15 .",
    "our upper bound @xmath16 is therefore given by @xmath17",
    "we first study how to optimize a scale free network with a single power law regime by varying the exponent @xmath5 and keeping @xmath18 constant  @xcite .",
    "= 7.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ pss ] , we plot the values of @xmath19 , @xmath9 , and @xmath20 , for a range of the exponent @xmath5 for a network with @xmath21 nodes and @xmath22  @xcite . for this choice of @xmath3 , the upper bound of @xmath20 is given by @xmath23 [ see eq .",
    "(  [ upperbound ] ) ] .",
    "we find that : as @xmath5 increases , @xmath9 increases but @xmath19 decreases . for @xmath24 @xmath20",
    "is optimized but the maximum value of @xmath20 ( @xmath25 ) is small relative to the theoretical maximum @xmath26 .",
    "it is interesting that the network is optimized with a value of @xmath5 about 2.5 which is consistent with the range of exponents for many real networks  @xcite .",
    "we next analyze a slightly more complex form for @xmath6 . keeping @xmath27 constant , we consider degree distributions which consist of 2 segments",
    "each of which is a power law .",
    "the inflection point at which the distribution changes slope we denote by @xmath28 .",
    "the hypothesis is that the first power law segment ( for @xmath29 with exponent @xmath30 will contribute to the robustness against targeted attack and the second segment ( for @xmath31 ) with exponent @xmath5 will contribute to the robustness against random failures .",
    "we determine the relative weights of the two segments such that @xmath32 is maximized .",
    "to maintain constant @xmath3 as we change @xmath28 we again adjust the minimum , @xmath33 , of the distribution .",
    "= 7.0 cm    in fig .",
    "[ c25 ] , we plot the values of @xmath12 as a function of the inflection point @xmath28 for @xmath34 , @xmath35 and for various @xmath30 . we see that @xmath12 attains a maximum value that increases with increasing @xmath30 . thus for a given @xmath5 we can maximize @xmath12 by choosing appropriate values of @xmath28 and @xmath30 .",
    "we can further increase the maximum value of @xmath20 by changing the value of @xmath5 . in plots (",
    "not shown ) of @xmath12 as functions of @xmath28 , for @xmath36 and various values of @xmath5 , we find that as @xmath5 decreases , the maximum value attained by @xmath12 increases .",
    "thus we can maximize the robustness of a network with respect to both random failure and targeted attack by replacing the original degree distribution by one with the same @xmath27 but with two power law segments characterized by exponents @xmath30 and @xmath5 with @xmath30 large and @xmath5 close to one ( the lowest value of @xmath5 which yields physical results ) .    in these distributions with large values of @xmath30 the total probability in the tail of the distribution",
    "is a small fraction of the total probability , so that there is only on the order of one node in the tail and , due to the large value of @xmath30 , most of the nodes have almost the same number of links  very close to the minimum @xmath33 .",
    "with the insight that the larger the exponent @xmath30 the better the optimization , we now consider distributions with the initial power law segment ( @xmath37 ) of the distribution replaced by an exponential distribution @xmath38 .",
    "as expected we find that for a given @xmath39 , at some value of @xmath28 , @xmath40 is optimized and that the optimization increases as @xmath39 increases .",
    "considering the previous cases , it appears that the optimization strategy does not depend on the fact that the initial segment of the distribution is a power law or exponential .",
    "given that the total probability of the nodes in the second segment ( the tail of the distribution ) is very small ( of order 1 ) , as discussed above , we now want to study the case where the second segment is not a power law .",
    "we therefore consider here a case where the degree distribution consists of two gaussian segments .",
    "one gaussian has its center at @xmath0 and width @xmath41 and the second gaussian has its center at @xmath42 and width @xmath43 .",
    "the ratio @xmath44 represents the fraction of the number of nodes in the second gaussian to the total number of nodes .",
    "we consider cases in which @xmath44 and @xmath45 are the independent variables and @xmath0 must be a dependent variable in order to maintain a fixed value of @xmath3 .    in plots ( not shown ) of the total threshold @xmath12 in terms of the ratio @xmath44 for various values of @xmath45 , we find that the optimal @xmath12 increases and the optimal value of @xmath44 decreases as the value of @xmath45 increases .",
    "in addition , we obtain higher values of the optimal @xmath12 for smaller values of @xmath41 .",
    "this fact indicates that the highest value of @xmath12 is achieved in the limit where this width goes to zero . in this limit",
    "the lower segment tends toward a simple delta function .",
    "this observation motivates us to study next the optimization of networks consisting of two delta functions .",
    "next we consider the degree distribution that consists of two delta functions : @xmath46 as in the case of two gaussian segments , we calculate the total threshold as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 for a fixed value of @xmath18 .",
    "we obtain analytical expressions for both @xmath13 and @xmath9 as follows .    using eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) , @xmath47    for the threshold for targeted attack , we must consider two cases :    ( i)@xmath48 . in this case , after the targeted attack , the only nodes that remain have degree @xmath0 .",
    "we find @xmath49    \\(ii ) @xmath50 .",
    "for this case nodes are removed only from the higher segment and we find @xmath51 with the expressions for the thresholds , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fc - random - td ] ) , ( [ eq : fc - targeted td upper ] ) , and ( [ eq : fc - targeted td lower ] ) , we are able to evaluate the total threshold @xmath12 .",
    "we can obtain an expression for the optimal value of @xmath45 as a function of @xmath44 by determining the value of @xmath45 for which @xmath12 is maximized . based on our results above",
    ", we expect the maximum will be obtained for @xmath44 small .",
    "using eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fc - random - td ] ) and ( [ eq : fc - targeted td lower ] ) , we find that for small @xmath44 the optimal value of @xmath45 can be approximated by @xmath52 using this result and eq .",
    "( [ upperbound ] ) we find , for small r , @xmath53    thus @xmath12 approaches the theoretical maximum value when @xmath44 approaches , but is not , zero . for a network of n nodes ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath12 is obtained when @xmath44=@xmath54 the smallest possible value consistent with there being 1 node of degree @xmath45 .",
    "given this @xmath44 the equation determining the optimal @xmath45 is @xmath55    figure  [ contourtdkav3 ] demonstrates the behavior of the optimal @xmath12 as a function of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we see that the highest values of the optimal @xmath12 are attained as @xmath44 approaches zero ; and for a given small value of @xmath44 , @xmath12 is optimized for @xmath45 from eq .",
    "( [ k2 ] ) .",
    "= 7.0 cm    the general nature of our results hold for the metric defined in eq .",
    "( [ e9 ] ) as well as for metrics @xmath12 defined as a linear combination of the random and targeted thresholds @xmath56 where @xmath28 and @xmath57 allow one to specify for a given network the importance to be attached to random and targeted attack respectively .",
    "the only modification to our results for these alternative metrics , is that the prefactor a is generalized to @xmath58",
    "we develop a strategy for optimization of scale free and two - peaked networks against both random failures and targeted attacks . to our knowledge , this is the first study of the robustness of complex networks to multiple types of failure / attack .",
    "we find that the network which approaches the theoretical maximum level of optimization is generated with a degree distribution which is non - zero at only two values : @xmath0 and @xmath45 .",
    "this level of optimization is possible because in order to obtain a value of @xmath19 which is essentially 1 we have to wire only 1 node with a large number of links .",
    "the remaining nodes , all with the same degree , provide essentially the same high degree of resilience to targeted attack as for the case in which all nodes have degree @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ comparison ] compares the level of optimization obtained for these optimized networks two - delta - function networks with the level of optimization obtained for networks with two power laws segments and with the theoretical maximum values which can be obtained .",
    "subjects for further study include ( i ) an analysis of the static and dynamic properties of the optimized two delta function networks which we have identified here and ( ii ) the optimization of complex networks under combined random failure and targeted attack .",
