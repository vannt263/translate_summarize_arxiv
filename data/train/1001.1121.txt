    "in three spatial dimensions , in the unitary limit of a quantum bose or fermi gas with point - like interactions , the scattering length diverges .",
    "`` unitary '' here refers to the limit on the cross section imposed by unitarity .",
    "these systems provide intriguing examples of interacting , scaling invariant theories with dynamical exponent @xmath0 , i.e. non - relativistic .",
    "the infinite scattering length occurs at a fixed point of the renormalization group in the zero temperature theory , thus the models are quantum critical .",
    "the only energy scales in the problem are the temperature and chemical potential , and thermodynamic properties are expected to reveal universal behavior .",
    "they can be realized experimentally by tuning the scattering length to @xmath8 using a feshbach resonance .",
    "( see for instance @xcite and references therein . )",
    "they are also thought to occur at the surface of neutron stars .",
    "the systems have attracted much theoretical interest , and remain challenging problems due to the lack of small parameter for a perturbative expansion , such as @xmath9 or @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the scattering length , and @xmath12 the range of the 2-body potential .",
    "early works were done by leggett and nozires and schmitt - rink@xcite .",
    "the universal scaling behavior was studied in @xcite . in 3 dimensions ,",
    "this is the physics of the bcs / bec crossover : since the fixed point occurs for an attractive coupling , the fermions may form a bosonic bound state which can subsequently undergo bec .",
    "this cross - over was studied analytically in @xcite by considering a model of 2-component fermions coupled to the bosonic bound state .",
    "monte - carlo studies were performed in @xcite .",
    "the models can be studied in spatial dimension @xmath13@xcite and an epsilon expansion carried out@xcite .",
    "there has also been some attempts to apply the ads / cft correspondence to these non - relativistic systems@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we describe a new analytic approach to studying the unitary limit based on our treatment of quantum gases in @xcite , which appears to be well suited to the problem since it allows an expansion in the inverse coupling .",
    "let us motivate this approach as follows .",
    "in one spatial dimension , the fixed point occurs for repulsive interactions .",
    "the model is integrable@xcite and its thermodynamics determined exactly by the so - called thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba)@xcite . in the tba , the free energy is expressed in terms of a pseudo - energy which is a solution to an integral equation with a kernel related to the logarithm of the s - matrix . in the unitary limit the coupling goes to @xmath14 and the s - matrix @xmath1 .",
    "the tba is then identical to a free gas of fermionic particles .",
    "the formalism developed in @xcite was modeled after the tba : the free energy is expressed as a sum of diagrams where the vertices represent matrix elements of the logarithm of the ( zero temperature ) s - matrix .",
    "however since generally the n - body s - matrix does not factorize into 2-body scattering , the series can not be summed exactly as in the tba . nevertheless , a consistent resummation of an infinite number of diagrams involving only 2-body scattering , the so - called foam diagrams , can serve as a useful approximation if the gas is not too dense .",
    "the result of summing these diagrams leads to an integral equation for a pseudo - energy , as in the tba ; in fact in 1 spatial dimension the tba is recovered to lowest order in the kernel . since the formalism is based on the s - matrix , it can be very useful for studying the unitary limit where @xmath1 .",
    "in this paper we present the main formulas for the 3-dimensional case , however we mainly analyze the 2-dimensional case ; analysis of the 3d case will be published separately@xcite .",
    "phase transitions in two - dimensional fermi gases were studied in e.g. @xcite .",
    "the fixed point separating the bec and bcs regimes goes to zero coupling when @xmath15 , thus it is not obvious whether a unitary limit exists at strong coupling .",
    "as we will argue , there is a scale - invariant limit at infinite coupling @xmath16 where the s - matrix @xmath1 .",
    "this is a meaningful unitary limit at very low ( @xmath17 ) or very high ( @xmath18 ) energy , although it does not correspond to a fixed point in the usual sense of a zero of the beta function .",
    "the scattering length indeed diverges in this limit .",
    "the possibility of this kind of unitary limit in two dimensions has not been considered before in the literature .    in the next section",
    "we describe the unitary limit in 1,2 and 3 dimensions and its relation to the renormalization group . in section iii",
    ", we define the interesting scaling functions for the free energy and single - particle energies by normalizing with respect to free theories . in section",
    "iv we describe the unitary limit of the formalism in @xcite in both two and three dimensions , where the integral equation becomes scale invariant .",
    "the @xmath15 case is especially simple since the kernel reduces to a constant and the integral equation becomes algebraic .",
    "analysis of these equations in @xmath19 is carried out for both infinitely repulsive or attractive fermions and bosons in sections v - viii .",
    "the extension of our formalism to multiple species of possibly mixed bosonic and fermionic particles is considered in section ix .",
    "kovtun et .",
    "conjectured that there is a universal lower bound to the ratio of the shear viscosity to the entropy density , [ boundzero ] /s where @xmath20 is boltzmann s constant@xcite .",
    "this was based on the ads / cft correspondence for _ relativistic _ theories in 3 spatial dimensions , and the bound is saturated for certain supersymmetric gauge theories .",
    "counterexamples to the @xmath3 bound were suggested to be non - relativistic@xcite , however no known fluid violates the bound .",
    "it thus interesting to study this ratio for non - relativistic theories , and in particular for @xmath19 theories where no conjecture have been put forward .",
    "it has also been suggested that the gases in the unitary limit may represent the most perfect fluid , i.e. with the lowest value of @xmath3 . for the spacetimes",
    "considered thus far for a non - relativistic ads / cft correspondence in 2d , the result found is that @xmath3 is exactly @xmath21@xcite .",
    "we analyze @xmath3 for the attractive fermionic case as a function of @xmath22 in section vi .",
    "if one disregards unphysical , potentially metastable regions , one finds @xmath23 .",
    "the other cases of repulsive bosons or fermions also satisfy the bound",
    ". however the attractive boson is below it : @xmath24 .",
    "the models considered in this paper are the simplest models of non - relativistic bosons and fermions with quartic interactions .",

    "[ bosonaction ] s = d^d dt @xmath26 ( throughout this paper , @xmath27 refers to the number of spatial dimensions ) . for fermions , due to the fermionic statistics , one needs at least a 2-component field @xmath28 : [ fermionaction ] s = d^d dt @xmath29 in both cases , positive @xmath30 corresponds to repulsive interactions .",
    "the bosonic theory only has a @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "the fermionic theory on the other hand has the much larger so(5 ) symmetry .",
    "this is evident from the work@xcite which considered a relativistic version , since the same arguments apply to a non - relativistic kinetic term .",
    "this is also clear from the work@xcite which considered an @xmath32-component version with sp(2n ) symmetry , and noting that sp(4 ) = so(5 ) .",
    "the free versions of the above theories have a scale invariance with dynamical exponent @xmath0 , i.e. are invariant under @xmath33 at a renormalization group fixed point , i.e. quantum critical point , the model is expected to have the same scale invariance .",
    "it is natural to define scaling dimensions @xmath34 in units of inverse length or wave - vector @xmath35 , i.e. @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "requiring the action to have zero scaling dimension gives @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the interaction is thus relevant for @xmath41 .",
    "the renormalization group behavior can be inferred from the coupling constant dependence of the s - matrix , or equivalently the kernels in section iv . for completeness",
    "we compute the beta function for arbitary @xmath27 in appendix a using conventional methods .",
    "consider first a single boson in @xmath42 dimensions .",
    "the kernel in eq .",
    "( [ g3d ] ) depends on the renormalized coupling @xmath43 given in eq .",

    "unitarity of the s - matrix amounts to @xmath48 .",
    "defining @xmath49 , and requiring @xmath43 to be independent of @xmath44 gives the beta - function : [ betafun ] = - - ^2 where @xmath50 is the logarithm of a length scale .",
    "the above result agrees with the calculation in appendix a. with the normalization of @xmath30 in the fermionic case as given in ( [ fermionaction ] ) , the resulting beta function is the same as above .    as discussed in @xcite , the beta - function in @xmath27 dimensions ( see appendix a ) has the following implications",
    ". see figure [ rg ] . for @xmath41",
    ", there is an infra - red stable fixed point at the positive value [ ghatstar ] _ * = ( 2-d ) ^d/2 ( d/2 ) 2^d / m corresponding to repulsive interactions . when @xmath51 , this fixed point is approached from @xmath52 when the cutoff @xmath44 is infinite . in the limit of @xmath53 the s - matrix , as given in eq .",
    "( [ 1ds ] ) becomes @xmath1 , which is the unitary limit . in the 1-dimensional thermodynamic bethe ansatz ,",
    "the thermodynamics is simply that of a free , one - component , fermionic gas , even though the original particle was a boson .    for @xmath54 , there is an _ ultra - violet _ stable fixed point at the _ negative _ coupling @xmath55 , i.e. an attractive interaction .",
    "a bosonic gas with attractive interactions can be unstable .",
    "however for a fermionic gas , the attractive interaction can be balanced by the fermi pressure , and the gas can be stable against collapse .",
    "we now describe the implications of the above fixed point on the scattering length .",
    "consider a single boson .",
    "a straightforward calculation of the differential cross section in @xmath27 spatial dimensions gives [ cross ] = | ( k ) |^2 where @xmath56 is the scattering amplitude . in the above formula",
    "@xmath57 is the momentum of one of the particles in the center of mass frame , i.e. @xmath58 . the @xmath59 are an important ingredient of the kernels of the integral equations in section iv , and were computed to all orders in @xcite for instance . in @xmath42 , we equate @xmath60 .",
    "this gives [ a3d ] a ( k ) = where @xmath43 is the renormalized coupling ( [ gr ] ) .",

    "in fact , at precisely the fixed point @xmath63 , @xmath64 , depending on from which side @xmath65 is approached . when @xmath66 , i.e. just less than @xmath65 , then @xmath67 , whereas when @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "the case @xmath70 is on the bcs side of the crossover , whereas @xmath71 is on the bec side .",
    "see figure [ rg ] .",
    "[ rg ]    the s - matrix ( [ 3ds ] ) has a pole at @xmath72 .",
    "since physical bound states correspond to poles at @xmath73 , the bound state exists only on the bec side of the critical point , with energy [ ebound ] e_bound - state = - in the bec to bcs crossover from @xmath74 to @xmath75 the binding energy goes to zero and the bound state disappears .",
    "nevertheless , the crossover is expected to be smooth , if on the bec side one includes the bound state in the thermodynamics .",
    "the @xmath15 case is somewhat more subtle due to the marginality of the coupling @xmath30 .",
    "the fixed point @xmath76 and the rg flows are depicted in figure [ rg ] .",
    "the fixed point at @xmath76 is just the free field theory , thus there is no analog of the bec / bcs cross - over .",
    "one can nevertheless formally define the unitary limit as @xmath1 , as in @xmath77 and @xmath78 . in this subsection",
    "we explore this possibility and interpret it using the renormalization group .",
    "as we ll see , this limit occurs at @xmath16 , and the scattering length diverges .",

    "the beta function ( [ 2dfp.1 ] ) is exact@xcite , thus this divergence is physical .",

    "similar arguments apply to the high energy limit of the repulsive case @xmath18 .",
    "it is clear that , unlike in @xmath78 , this definition of the unitary limit does not correspond to a renormalization group fixed point in the usual sense of a zero of the beta function and is somewhat engineered ; nevertheless it defines a scale - invariant theory .",

    "because of the logarithmic dependence on @xmath99 , the s - matrix does not have a pole .",
