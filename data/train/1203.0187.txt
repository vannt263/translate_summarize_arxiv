    "flavor is an unresolved puzzle in the standard model ( sm ) . on the one hand ,",
    "the strengths of flavor changing weak neutral current transitions , observed so far , are as feeble as expected in the sm . on the other , we have no clear idea as to why charged fermion masses are hierarchically organized among the generations , nor why there is a mild hierarchy between the solar and atmospheric neutrino mass squared differences .",
    "furthermore , there is no consensus on the reasons behind the rather small quark mixing angles and the relatively large neutrino mixing angles .",
    "a general expectation could be that of an underlying dynamics , yielding these features , to be revealed at some higher energy scale .",
    "new types of fields , which we generically call flavons @xcite , are likely to come into play there , mediating this dynamics and resulting in novel phenomena .",
    "flavor issues in the sm invariably arise in connection with the mass matrices of elementary fermions in generation space , though they do affect observable gauge interactions among massive fermions .",
    "those matrices , in turn , originate from yukawa coupling matrices as a consequence of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it may not be unreasonable , therefore , to expect @xcite the scale of flavor dynamics to be within an order of magnitude of the electroweak scale and be accessible at the lhc .",
    "any resultant runaway flavor - changing neutral current transition can be controled by linking @xcite the flavor nonconserving couplings to the pattern of fermion mass matrices .",
    "our focus in this paper is on lepton flavor violation with total lepton number conserved .",
    "this has already been observed @xcite in neutrino oscillation studies and is being probed @xcite in yet unseen radiative and trileptonic decays of the @xmath2 and the @xmath3 .",
    "if one were to extend the sm minimally just to include lightly massive and mixed majorana or dirac neutrinos ( the `` @xmath4msm '' ) , that model would have such flavor nonconservation restricted largely to the neutrino sector .",
    "in particular , no observable charged lepton flavor violation would be expected to occur in multilepton production experiments at high energy accelerators .",
    "however , such an implication is precisely what we challenge here .",
    "we argue that flavor violation could occur at the lhc with charged multileptons and without hard neutrinos in the final state : a signal that would indicate a radically new physics . in this sense ,",
    "our philosophy is fundamentally different from that of minimal flavor violation @xcite .",
    "we specifically propose searching for charged and flavor violating quadrilepton signals in 14 tev pp collisions at the lhc .",
    "recent advances in developing strategies @xcite for multilepton searches at the lhc make this proposal very timely .",
    "the possibility of flavor violating charged multilepton signals was raised earlier @xcite in the context of specific models .",
    "but we conduct here a more general study of final states with four charged and flavor violating leptons plus unobserved soft and forward hadrons at the lhc .",
    "the hard partonic subprocess that we have in mind is @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 stands for a charged lepton with @xmath7 as flavor indices @xmath8 , chosen in such a way that lepton flavor is not conserved .",
    "a simpler subprocess would be @xmath9 , @xmath10 , giving rise to flavor violating charged dileptons in hadronic collisions .",
    "the case with @xmath11 is severely constrained by experimental @xcite limits on @xmath12 conversion in nuclei with the corresponding new physics scale having been pushed beyond 10 tev which is hence inaccessible to the lhc . however , a dileptonic final state with one @xmath3 is relatively unconstrained .",
    "a general study of possible @xmath13 final states in pp collisions was carried out @xcite some time ago .",
    "our motivation for doing an analysis with charged quadrileptons instead is threefold , as explained below .",
    "several factors motivate our choice .",
    "first , the sm background , coming mainly from decays of hadroproduced 4w s or 4@xmath3s , to our signal is much less than in the dilepton case ; indeed , we shall argue that it can be made totally negligible here .",
    "second , if there is a discrete symmetry or conservation law in the underlying model of flavor violation , the flavons @xcite  or whichever new particles are responsible for the flavor violating phenomenon via their decays  would be pair produced . in such a case four",
    "flavor violating leptons would make a very characteristic final state . finally , unlike in the dilepton case , the production of a flavor violating quadrilepton final state consisting of only electrons and muons ( which are easiest to detect and study ) , arising from the annihilation of a quark and an antiquark of the same flavor , is not particularly constrained by any other experiment , mixed flavor violating four - lepton operators have been probed in searches @xcite for trileptonic decays of the muon and the @xmath3 such as @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "however , we propose here a search for their production in quark - antiquark annihilation , probing six fermionic operators .",
    "furthermore , configurations such as @xmath16 or @xmath17 , which we can study in our final state , are not accessible in those searched for decay processes .    as an illustration",
    ", we first consider the partonic subprocess @xmath18 in 14 tev pp collisions in an extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model @xcite with r - parity violation , taken only in the leptonic sector , i.e. @xmath19mssm .",
    "significant cross sections result at lhc14 for producing an @xmath20 final state .",
    "thus motivated , we perform a general analysis of allowed operators with the lowest dimensionality , written in terms of sm fields in the chiral basis and contributing to flavor violating charged quadrilepton production in @xmath21 annihilation .",
    "we classify all independent six fermion operators ( numbering twenty ) that can contribute to the effective lagrangian @xmath22 . assuming single operator dominance , the subprocess cross section",
    "is then computed for each .",
    "these are subsequently folded with parton distributions and appropriate cuts to compute the corresponding cross sections that are measurable in pp collisions at @xmath23=14 tev .",
    "also discussed is the sensitivity reach on @xmath0 in terms of the integrated luminosity .    the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we compute the cross section for producing an @xmath24 four lepton combination at @xmath25 = 14 tev in our @xmath19mssm model .",
    "iii is devoted to an enumeration of all twenty independent six fermionic operators contributing to the subprocess @xmath26 and to a discussion of the various permutation symmetry properties relating the corresponding production cross sections .",
    "iv contains numerical evaluations of the latter at 14 tev @xmath27 collisions at the lhc and of the associated sensitivity reach on the cutoff @xmath0 . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our conclusions .",

    "here @xmath28 are lepton flavor indices and the square bracket around @xmath29 implies that the coupling strength @xmath30 is antisymmetric between @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "there are consequent vertices between a sneutrino @xmath33 ( as well as an antisneutrino @xmath34 ) of flavor @xmath35 with charged leptons of flavors @xmath29 ( @xmath36 ) so that the sneutrino / antisneutrino can have a transition into the pair @xmath37 . in the annihilation of @xmath38 and @xmath39 of identical flavor",
    ", one can now have a diagram ( fig.1 ) with a virtual z boson , propagating in the s - channel and creating an on - shell @xmath40 pair , each of which decays into @xmath41 .",
    "taking into account the presence of two pairs of identical fermions in the final state , we can write the cross section for the process as @xcite & & ( pp _ i^- _ j^+",
    "_ i^- _ j^+ + x ) = dx_1 dx_2 _ q [ q(x_1)|q(x_2 ) + x_1 x_2 ] + & & ( q |q _ k |_k ) br(_k _ i^- _ j^+ ) br(|_k _ i^- _ j^+ ) , where ( q |q ) = ( t u - m^4 _ ) ( a_q^2 + b_q^2)|d_z(s)|^2 . here",

    "for the situation of interest in which the said mass varies from 100 gev to 1 tev , the cross section for the production of @xmath20 in 14 tev pp collision goes monotonically down from about 6 fb to slightly below 10@xmath61 fb , cf .",

    "tensor products and leptoquark bilinears were not included ; they can always be cast by fierz transformations @xcite into the form of eq.[han - effective ] .",
    "operators involving gauge bosons generally yield contributions suppressed by @xmath73 or @xmath74 terms and were ignored .",
    "the coefficients @xmath66 were taken to be @xmath75(4@xmath76 with an underlying strongly interacting gauge theory , characterized by a fine structure coupling strength of order unity , in mind .    in writing a corresponding effective lagrangian for our concerned partonic subprocess in terms of sm fields ,",
    "we find it convenient to work in the chiral basis .",
    "this procedure has two advantages .",
    "( 1 ) one can keep the electroweak symmetry properties of the operators as manifest .",
    "( 2 ) different operators differ in some chirality or other of one or more of the fermions , thereby contributing incoherently to the subprocess with zero interference .",
    "once overall baryon and lepton conservation are imposed , one can see that every operator always contains an odd number of left - chiral fermion doublet fields .",

    "since this component has only weak interactions , it is reasonable to further assume the multiplicative occurrence of the semiweak @xmath77 coupling constant from the underlying theory and posit the following form for the effective lagrangian leading to our subprocess : _ eff = _ p , r , s , a, ... e ,",

    "let us first make four remarks .",
    "( 1 ) the notation @xmath85 is used respectively for the @xmath77 doublet component and singlet charged lepton fields of flavor @xmath29 .",
    "because of @xmath77 invariance , one can also write similar operators replacing @xmath86 by @xmath87 , but we are not interested in those here .",
    "( 2 ) all @xmath88 combinations with one , two or three tensor matrices @xmath89 can be reduced @xcite by fierz transformations to scalar or vector products between chiral fields .",
    "( 3 ) we are finally left with two sets of operators : set i comprising products of three scalar chiral fermion bilinears and set ii consisting of products of one scalar chiral fermion bilinear with two contracted vector chiral fermion bilinears .",
    "( 4 ) in each member of the first set of operators , all three bilinears are disconnected from one another ; this set of operators is called disconnected and designated d. among the three bilinears of every member of the second set , two are connected by contraction while the third is disconnected from the rest ; this set is called semi - disconnected and designated s. it is noteworthy that operators with all three fermion bilinears connected with one another by contraction are automatically absent from our compilation .    we list in tables [ disconnected - operators ] and [ semi - disconnected - operators ] the precise form of each operator in sets i and ii respectively .",

    "given our choice of the value of unity for the coefficients @xmath82 and of universality for the cutoff scale @xmath0 , such an interchange has become a symmetry of @xmath22 in consequence . finally ,",
    "since the lepton masses are neglected , the expressions for the square of the invariant matrix element and the cross section should become independent of lepton flavor labels .",

    ", all members of the set @xmath171 will have an identical total cross section . though this cross section is numerically close to that of the set @xmath172 , it is in fact discernably different from the latter .",
    "we first recount the signal of the process discussed in ref.@xcite . the partonic cross section , ignoring fermion mass terms , works out to be approximately @xmath173 , @xmath174 being the partonic center - of - mass ( cm ) energy of the @xmath175 pair . in calculating measurable event rates ,",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite used strong lepton @xmath176 and azimuthal cuts and kept the invariant @xmath13 mass above 250 gev to drastically reduce a sizable sm background from ww and drell - yan @xmath177 production .",

    "some examples are models with new neutrino interactions @xcite , those with heavy majorana fermions @xcite and ones with supersymmetry @xcite . in order to avoid confusion with such other bsm scenarios ,",
    "we insist on no missing @xmath58 or @xmath188 in the final state as a key signal criterion . in order to sharpen our leptonic signals and to avoid overlap with other production mechanisms ,",
    "the absence of hard jets from the final state is required ; only soft and forward hadrons and minijets from @xmath3 s are allowed .",
