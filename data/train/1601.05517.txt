    "the charge and spin modes have symmetric and anti - symmetric charge distributions , respectively , in the primary channels ( spin - charge separation ) , where the charge velocity @xmath10 is generally greater than the spin velocity @xmath11 .",
    "the interaction between counterpropagating channels generates small amount of dragged charges reverse - travelling in the subsidiary channels  ( charge fractionalization ) , as illustrated by coupled wave packets in fig .",
    "1(a ) safiprb1995,kamatanatnano2014,imuraprb2002 .    in a practical device",
    ", such interacting channels can be formed in a finite region , outside of which the left and right moving channels are spatially separated as shown in fig .",

    "the initial electronic state in @xmath12 exhibits a double - step profile in the energy distribution function @xmath13 , where the width and height are given by the excitation energy @xmath14 and the tunneling probability @xmath15 , respectively , of the pc , as shown in the central inset at the bottom of fig .",
    "however , the interaction alters the electronic spectrum significantly during the transport lesueurprl2010 .    in the plasmon picture",
    ", charge wave packets randomly injected from the pc can propagate in a non - interacting manner .",
    "each time a single electron is injected into @xmath12 , an initial wave packet , shown just on the left side of the injection point , is generated .",
    "it can be described as a linear superposition of the four plasmon eigenmodes . since the charge and spin modes have different velocities , the injected charge splits into four plasmon packets as illustrated .",
    "we will refer to this splitting as electronic relaxation in the sense that a single - particle excitation in one channel is relaxed into collective charge excitations over the channels .",
    "this takes place within a length @xmath16 , which is approximately 100 nm at the excitation voltage @xmath17 of 1 mv for typical velocities @xmath18 m / s and @xmath19 at @xmath6 = 2 bocquillonnatcomm2013,kamataprb2010,kumadaprb2011 , from the injection point .",
    "when random charge packets are successively injected from a biased pc , channels are filled with incoherent ensemble of plasmon wave packets .",
    "a fast wave packet in the charge mode can catch up with a slow packet in the spin mode , and overtake it without any scattering as the plasmons are non - interacting .",
    "therefore , the excitation of non - interacting plasmons can not be thermalized cazalillaprl206,kovrizhinprb2011,levkivskyiprb2012 .",
    "we next show that non - trivial binary spectrum can be generated in the excitation scheme described in the previous subsection .",
    "to see this , it is important to note that electron - hole excitations ( and thus the energy spectra ) in all channels are correlated with each other as they all originate from the common injection process at the pc .",
    "most of the generated wave packets flow to the downstream of the injection point , which we refer to as ` direct - heating ( dh ) region ' [ the red region in fig .",
    "previous studies have shown that the spectrum in this region can be described by an approximate fermi distribution at temperature @xmath20 , as schematically shown in the left inset @xcite .",
    "this might not contradict the non - thermalizing nature of tl model , as the theory have shown that the electronic relaxation results in an approximate fermi distribution for this case @xcite .",
    "however , the experiment on the dh region was not successful in identifying the presence of long - lived non - equilibrium states .    here , we focus on the spectrum in the counterpropagating channels , which we refer to as ` indirect - heating ( ih ) region ' ( the blue region ) . because of the small amplitude of the correlated excitations , the spectrum in the ih region should have a small fraction of the spectrum in the dh region ( at @xmath21 ) .",
    "this fraction @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) is determined by the interaction , or the plasmon eigenmodes of the system [ see sec .",
    "the majority of the spectrum should reflect the base temperature @xmath24 of the system .",
    "this leads to a non - trivial binary spectrum in the ih regions , as shown in the right inset .",
    "the focus of this study is the stability of this unusual mixture during transport .",
    "this experimental scheme can be understood as a spatial analog of quantum quench .",
    "this analogy is allowed because the plasmon transport is unidirectional from the injection point through the channels to the ohmic contacts at the ends of the channels , as is the flow of time in quantum quench ( see discussions in sec .",
    "vb ) . the initial state prepared as single electron excitations relaxes into plasmon excitations in the dh and ih regions .",
    "such spatial evolution can be studied by using pc injectors at various distances from the qd spectrometer @xcite .",
    "if the ergodicity is assumed , a many - body state may relax to a thermal - equilibrium state after travelling a long distance .",
    "however , ` non - equilibrium steady state ' , which can be defined as a state that remains non - equilibrium even after travelling a sufficiently long ( conceptually infinite ) distance , may emerge in an integrable model .",
    "the comparison between the experiment in sec .",
    "iii and the simulation in sec .",
    "iv implies that the binary spectrum is the signature of ` non - equilibrium steady state ' expected in the integrable model of tl liquid .",

    "no heating is seen at quantized conductance @xmath82 @xmath91 [ trace ( iii ) ] and 2 [ trace ( v ) ] .",
    "in contrast to the left edge of the spectra , the right edge , which probes @xmath92 , remains steep with @xmath93 for all @xmath75 values .",

    "the fact that @xmath103 reaches almost the same maximum values at @xmath104 0.5 and 1.5 indicates that the injected heat is equally partitioned between @xmath40 and @xmath77 . as these data show , the coupling between hot and cold copropagating channels results in spectra that looks like the equilibrium fermi distribution in both of the copropagating channels .",
    "theory suggests that the actual distribution is different from the fermi distribution even in the dh region @xcite .",
    "however , the deviation is too small to be resolved experimentally , resulting in seemingly thermalized spectra indistinguishable from the equilibrium distribution .",
    "consequently , the dh scheme is not suitable for studying non - equilibrium steady states .",
    "in contrast to the case of dh region , qualitatively different tunneling spectra emerge when the spectrometer is placed in the ih region .",
    "ih regions appear in @xmath105 and/or @xmath106 when one of pc2-pc4 is adjusted in the tunneling regime with the pc conductance @xmath107 @xmath70 @xmath108 .",

    "is increased , an additional small but long tail develops , resulting in an anomalous spectrum that can not be fitted with a single fermi distribution function .",
    "the long tails appear on one or both sides of the peak depending on the location of the spectrometer with respect to the pc .",
    "for example , injection from pc2 induces an ih region in @xmath110 , but not in @xmath38 [ inset of fig .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that a tail appears only on the left side of the peak [ anomalous excitation in @xmath71 ] , by recalling that the current profiles on the left and right sides of the peak reflect @xmath61and @xmath112 , respectively .",
    "injection from pc3 should also induce an ih region only in @xmath110 .",
    "this is consistent with the tail appearing on the left side [ excitation in @xmath40 ] as seen in fig .",
    "the amplitude of the tail on the left side is comparable to that in fig .",
    "a small step - like profile on the right side is associated with the excited state of the qd , where electromagnetic and/or phonon - mediated energy transfer might be responsible only for this geometry with a short distance between pc3 and qd ( @xmath114  0.3 @xmath35 m ) @xcite .",
    "therefore this step - like structure is disregarded in the following discussion .",
    "injection from pc4 induces ih regions in both @xmath115 and @xmath38 , resulting in tails on both sides [ excitation in @xmath40 and @xmath116 in fig .",
    "in this case , pc4 excites left moving plasmons in modes [ l , c / s ] , which drag non - equilibrium charges in @xmath117  up to the right of the qd .",
    "this gives a tail on the right side of the peak .",
    "however , this measurement point is ill - defined as it is located near the boundary between the ih region and the unheated upstream region of @xmath38 .",
    "this could be the reason of the small amplitude of the right tail as compared to the tails in figs .",
    "4(a ) and 4(b ) .",
    "moreover , the left moving plasmons in the interacting channels @xmath38  and @xmath118  are interrupted by the qd , and scatter into the other interacting region with channels @xmath105and @xmath37 .",
    "this plasmon scattering leads another ih region [ denoted by ih in the inset of fig .",
    "4(c ) ] in @xmath36 , which generates a tail on the left side of the peak .",
    "the small amplitude of the left tail reflects this plasmon scattering .",
    "apart from the quantitative differences , the unusual tails appear in all of the ih regions we investigated . as shown by thin solid lines in fig .",
    "4 , all the spectra in the ih regions can be fitted well with the binary spectrum @xmath119which consists of majority carriers at lower temperature @xmath120 and minority carriers of a fraction @xmath22 ( @xmath70 0.1 ) at high temperature @xmath121 .    to further demonstrate the validity of eq .",

    "in contrast , no features associated with the excited states appear for the ih region , unless @xmath150  exceeds 2 mv .",

    "1(b ) ] , which is not in thermal equilibrium assumed in the quantum - quench simulation .",
    "previous experiments for two copropagating channels @xcite , as well as our results in sec .",
    "iiib , resulted in a spectrum close to fermi distribution function , which is similar to the spectra @xmath272 and @xmath273 in fig .",
    "this behavior can be reproduced in simulations of quantum quench starting from a double - step function in one channel @xcite as well as from thermal equilibrium states at different temperatures kovrizhinprb2011 .",
    "this suggests that these different initial states does not play significant roles in the final state for the problem .",
    "therefore , quantum quench starting from a fermi distribution function is not a bad assumption to validate the appearance of binary spectrum in the system .",
    "thirdly , different from the quantum quench problem , the length of the interacting region in our experiment is finite .",
    "thanks to the chiral nature of quantum - hall  edge channels , the plasmon transport is unidirectional particularly outside the interacting region .",
    "non - equilibrium charge that left the interacting region never returns back .",
    "this prevents unwanted effects in the leads and dissipative ohmic contacts , and allows us to neglect the finite - length problem .",
    "such unidirectional transport can not be expected for conventional 1d wires connected to diffusive leads .    in this way",
    ", our experiment can be regarded as spatial analog of quantum quench .",
    "non - equilibrium transport in integer quantum hall edge channels has been investigated for a few decades . when the scattering between the channels is well suppressed , the chemical potential of each channel is conserved during the transport , allowing the system to have independent charge distributions on the channels @xcite . when the coupling to the environment , such as phonon bath , is negligible , the heat or the electron temperature of the system is conserved during the transport grangerprl2009,jezouinscience2013,prokudinaprl2014 .",
    "more intriguingly , when the interaction is not fully ergodic to cause thermal equilibration , the system may have infinite numbers of conserved quantities bergesprl2004 .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis has successfully revealed non - equilibrium electronic distribution with , at least , four conserved quantities ( the binary spectrum parametrized by @xmath281 , @xmath282 , @xmath22 , as well as @xmath35 ) , which is greater than two ( @xmath35 and @xmath217 ) for trivial cases .",
    "the tl theory suggests that the plasmons are non - interacting and thus should be conserved during the transport .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the non - equilibrium spectrum is sustained for a long distance .",
    "this is attractive for carrying much information as plasmon excitations rather than short - lived electronic excitations @xcite .",
    "in previous reports , other energy transfer mechanisms such as phonons prokudinaprb2010 or impurities @xcite have been discussed to explain the charge and heat transfer .",
    "such extrinsic effects with random processes are expected to result in a continuous thermalization into a trivial fermi distribution .",
    "this contrasts with our binary spectrum independent of the propagation length ( from @xmath700 to 10 @xmath35 m ) , which implies that the extrinsic thermalization processes becomes relevant only at longer distances .",
    "this signifies the importance of coulomb interaction in 1d systems prepared in the integer quantum hall regime .",
    "we have investigated the energy spectrum of non - equilibrium states in quantum - hall tomonaga - luttinger liquids . when non - equilibrium charge is injected from a pc ,",
    "a non - trivial binary spectrum consisting of high- and low - temperature components appears in the ih region while a seemingly thermalized spectrum appears in the dh region .",
    "the binary spectrum is sustained even after travelling 5 - 10 @xmath0 , much longer than the length for electronic relaxation ( about 0.1 @xmath0 ) , without showing significant thermalization .",
    "this can be compared with the simulation of quantum quench problem , which also suggest the emergence of an approximate binary spectrum as a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "the long - lived binary spectrum implies that the system is well described by non - interacting plasmons , which suggests that low - energy excitations of edge channels in the integer quantum hall regime can be well understood as a tl liquid .",
