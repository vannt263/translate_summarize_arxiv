    "in this paper we use the method developed in ref .  @xcite to confirm that the mechanism of early particle production at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) may be understood , to a good approximation , in terms of emission from independent sources which extend over a wide longitudinal range .",
    "our analysis is performed with the help of simple formulas from ref .",
    "@xcite for the correlation coefficients .",
    "it uses the data taken by the alice collaboration for pb+pb collisions at @xmath0 in the form presented in the phd thesis by i.  sputowska  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the long - range rapidity correlations in hadronic collision experiments reveal information on the dynamics and evolution of the system in its earliest partonic phase .",
    "experimentally , the multiplicity correlations in early @xmath2 and @xmath3 collisions  @xcite and nuclear collisions  @xcite were followed by the relativistic heavy - ion and @xmath2 experiments at rhic  @xcite and the lhc  @xcite .",
    "physical pictures , models , and theoretical methods have been constructed along the quest to understand the data  @xcite .",
    "the basic assumptions of the applied _ superposition framework _ are following  @xcite :    1 .",
    "particle emission occurs independently from longitudinally extended sources .",
    "the forward ( f ) and backward ( b ) bins are sufficiently well separated in pseudorapidity , such that the transition from the initial state to the final hadron distribution does not cause mixing between particles belonging to the f and b bins .",
    "actually , our approach takes into account three stages typically distinguished in the evolution of the system : 1 )  early production of initial particles ( forming an entropy density ) from sources , 2 )  hydrodynamic or transport evolution in the intermediate phase , and finally 3 )  production of hadrons and their subsequent registration in detectors .",
    "as explained in detail in refs .",
    "@xcite ( cf . also appendix  [ app : supp ] in the present work ) , the above - mentioned stages 1 ) and 3 ) involve , from the statistical point of view , folding of statistical distributions , whereas stage 2 ) results in a linear transformation of the particle ( fluid ) density . the three stages may be combined to yield a very simple `` pocket '' formula involving only one free parameter , relating the correlation of the initial sources @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the f and b bins in spatial rapidity , denoted as @xmath6 , to statistical quantities accessible experimentally .",
    "these quantities are the correlation of the numbers of charged hadrons @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the experimental f and b bins in pseudorapidity , denoted as @xmath9 ( a.k.a .",
    "the @xmath10 coefficient ) , and the scaled variances of multiplicities in the f and b bins , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . for symmetric collisions and for symmetrically arranged pseudorapidity bins @xmath13 , and we have ( see appendix  [ app : supp ] ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for pearson s correlation coefficient , @xmath16 denotes the scaled variance , and @xmath17 is a phenomenological constant , whose anatomy is discussed in appendix  [ app : supp ] .",
    "an important feature is that @xmath17 does not depend on the rapidity separation of the f and b bins , nor ( to a good approximation ) on the centrality of the collision .",
    "thus , for a given experimental setup ( energy of the collision , width of the bins in pseudorapidity , detector acceptance ) it is _",
    "constant_. we can rearrange eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhos ] ) to extract @xmath17 : @xmath18    it should be stressed that relations  ( [ eq : rhos]-[eq : omr1 ] ) originate solely from assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) specified above and hold for any experimental data sample ( e.g. , any centrality cut ) .",
    "thus their verification directly checks assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "two straightforward tests emerge here , each based on one of the above formulas .",
    "first , we may use eq .",
    "( [ eq : omr1 ] ) with the experimental data for @xmath9 and @xmath19 , as well as with the assumption @xmath20 which should hold for not too large bin separations @xmath21 . if thus obtained @xmath17 is indeed constant , the test is passed and the superposition model works .",
    "second , we may use a suitably chosen constant value of @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhos ] ) and obtain @xmath6 at various centralities and bin separations @xmath21 .",
    "parameter obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omr1 ] ) with the data for pb+pb collisions at @xmath22 recorded by the alice experiment , digitized by the authors from figs .",
    "( 3.3,3.4 ) of the phd thesis  @xcite .",
    "the result is plotted as a function of the width of the centrality bin , @xmath23 , for several centralities of the center of the bin , @xmath24 , and for two centrality selection methods of ref .",
    "@xcite : ` vzero ` ( empty symbols ) and ` zdcvszem ` ( filled symbols ) .",
    "the very similar values of @xmath17 conform to the assumption of emission from independent longitudinally - extended sources which are maximally correlated over the pseudorapidity separation @xmath1 between the forward and backward bins , i.e. , @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig : deltacen ] ]     but for the forward - backward correlation of the sources @xmath6 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhos ] ) , evaluated with the average value of the superposition parameter @xmath25 .",
    "[ fig : fbsourcescen ] ]    we begin presenting our results with the @xmath17 parameter obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq : omr1 ] ) . the experimental quantities",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath26 are extracted from a manual digitalization of the points in figs .  ( 3.3,3.4 ) published in the phd thesis by i.  sputowska  @xcite .",
    "the alice measurements are carried out with two different methods of determining the centrality of the collision , ` vzero ` ( empty symbols ) and ` zdcvszem ` ( filled symbols ) .",
    "essentially , the first method uses the multiplicity of hadrons in the central bin , whereas the other effectively determines the number of spectators ( or participants ) in the collision .",
    "we denote the center and the width of a centrality bin with @xmath24 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "our values for @xmath17 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltacen ] as a function of @xmath23 for the f and b bin separation @xmath1 ( largest accessible experimentally ) .",
    "this separation is sufficiently large to minimize the mixing between the bins during the evolution of the system ( our assumption  ( b ) ) . at the same time",
    ", it is small enough to expect that the sources are maximally correlated , i.e. , @xmath27 . we note that the values for @xmath17 are within the band @xmath28 for both methods of the centrality determination and for various @xmath23 and @xmath24 . taking into account the fact that @xmath19 and @xmath26 vary significantly ( even up to factors of 5 , cf . figs .",
    "( 3.3,3.4 ) in refs .",
    "@xcite ) , the fact that the values of @xmath17 are almost constant is far from trivial and conforms to the superposition mechanism from independent sources .",
    "of course , there are departures in @xmath17 from a strict constant value , and there is a number of factors which cause the effect : some remnant mixing of the bins ( caused , e.g. , by partons emitted into distant pseudorapidities in the early stage , or resonance decays in the late stage ) , non - linearity of the hydrodynamic or transport evolution , leading to corrections to the simple eq .",
    "( [ eq : hyd ] ) .",
    "also , there may be nonlinear effects in the early production mechanism , as present , e.g. , in the mixed model  @xcite , where wounded nucleons  @xcite are amended with an admixture of binary collisions .",
    "the fact that @xmath17 is to a good approximation constant shows that these effects are not very significant .",
    "we also note that the obtained values of @xmath17 are larger than @xmath29 , which complies to the constraint  ( [ eq : cons ] ) .",
    "next , we present the result for the forward - backward correlation of the number of the initial sources , @xmath6 , obtained from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhos ] ) , where we use the average value of @xmath17 from fig .",
    "[ fig : deltacen ] , namely @xmath25 .",
    "the correlation is plotted as a function @xmath23 for various @xmath24 and for the data with both ` vzero ` and ` zdcvszem ` centrality determination methods for @xmath1 , the same as used in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltacen ] .",
    "we note that the resulting values for @xmath6 are close to @xmath29 , in accordance to the hypothesis of a maximum correlation of sources over a moderate pseudorapidity range .",
    "the fact that for certain cases the points go slightly above @xmath29 ( which is mathematically precluded for the correlation coefficient ) is caused by the above - listed effects modifying the simplest superposition model , as well as by experimental errors , not incorporated in our analysis .     but plotted for several values of centrality @xmath24 as a function of the forward - backward pseudorapidity separation @xmath21 . ]    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : corretasfsb ] we plot @xmath6 as a function of the pseudorapidity separation @xmath21 for the case @xmath30 . for this purpose",
    "the necessary data were digitized from figs .",
    "( 3.1,3.6 ) of ref .  @xcite .",
    "as before , we use @xmath25 .",
    "we note that in the covered range of @xmath21 the resulting @xmath6 is very close to @xmath29 and independent of the centrality @xmath24 .",
    "the main result of our analysis is that the hadron production mechanism based on production from independent sources , strongly correlated over the accessible pseudorapidity range , works very well in pb+pb collisions at the lhc .",
    "the key test here is the constant value of the @xmath17 parameter , as exhibited in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltacen ] .",
    "it also shows that the data analysis based on standard measures of f - b correlations is by all means useful and allows us for access to physics questions of the particle production mechanism in ultra - relativistic heavy - ion collisions . note that the usefulness for the tests of the superposition mechanism explored here holds despite the effect of _ centrality fluctuations _ , which may be reduced through the use of other more elaborate correlation measures  @xcite .",
    "the fact that @xmath31 in the covered range of @xmath32 and for all values of centrality indicates that the original sources in the early phase of the reaction may indeed be viewed as longitudinally extended objects ( strings  @xcite ) . if such objects extend over rapidity in such a way that the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bins are always covered , then in each event @xmath35 and by definition we achieve the maximum correlation , @xmath36 .    the analysis presented in this paper was model - independent in the sense that we have only used the assumptions ( a ) and ( b ) from sect .",
    "[ sec : intro ] , but have not referred to any specific model of the sources and particle production . with the method applied here and further spelled out in refs .",
    "@xcite , such explicit models may be put to stringent tests with the help of experimental forward - backward correlation data .",
    "in this appendix we recall the relevant formulas in the superposition model .",
    "a detailed derivation is presented in ref .",
    "let the number of produced particles @xmath37 in bin @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) be composed of independent emissions from @xmath40 sources , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a random number of particles produced by the @xmath43th source .",
    "the distribution of @xmath42 is assumed to be universal , i.e. , independent of the source @xmath43 .",
    "then one finds the well - known superposition formulas @xmath44 analogously , for the covariance between two well - separated bins we get immediately @xmath45 where we have used the fact that @xmath46 , holding for @xmath43 and @xmath47 belonging to two different well - separated bins . as a result ,",
    "formulas ( [ eq : var],[eq : cors ] ) correspond to a single superposition step .",
    "in particular , such steps occur in the partonic phase , where partons are produced from the initial sources ( strings ) , as well as in the late stage , where production of hadrons and their subsequent detection takes place .",
    "if superposition steps directly follow one another , the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : var],[eq : cors ] ) remains preserved .",
    "for instance , this is the case of the hadron production step followed by the detection step ( where the generic random variable @xmath42 would correspond to the detection of a hadron ) , hence we may combine these steps into a single one .",
    "the intermediate evolution stage ( hydrodynamics , transport ) also preserves the structure of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : var],[eq : cors ] ) and upon combining the three stages one finally has  @xcite @xmath49    let @xmath50 denote the random number of partons produced in the first stage , and @xmath51 the random number of hadrons produced at final hadronization and registered by the detector .",
    "further , if the number of partons is denoted with @xmath52 and the density of hydrodynamic fluid after the evolution as @xmath53 , we may approximate the effect of the intermediate phase as @xmath54 where @xmath55 describes the intermediate evolution . )",
    "is used in ref .",
    "@xcite , but is does not affect the conclusions . ] as a result , we find @xmath56    the inverse relations , relating moments of the sources via the moments on the measured hadrons , read @xmath57 where the @xmath17 parameter is given by relation @xmath58 dividing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : covvar2 ] ) side by side yields @xmath59 which is our key formula  ( [ eq : rhos ] ) .",
    "note that it involves only one combination of the parameters of the overlaid distributions and intermediate evolution , @xmath17 .",
    "the random variable @xmath51 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) corresponds to hadronization of the fluid folded with the detector acceptance . due to its statistical nature , production of hadrons from the hydrodynamic fluid",
    "is well described by a poisson distribution , whereas detector acceptance is modeled with a bernoulli distribution .",
    "folding of the poisson and bernoulli distributions yields a poisson distribution , hence @xmath60 . since all other parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) are positive , we conclude that @xmath61    distributions of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are universal in the sense that they do not depend on the pseudorapidity of the bin or the centrality of the collision .",
    "the parameter @xmath55 , which describes the hydrodynamic or transport response , is also expected to be approximately universal , meaning linear response to the initial condition  @xcite . therefore we expect @xmath62 .",
