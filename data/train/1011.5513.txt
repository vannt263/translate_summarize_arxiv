    "as is well known , general relativity in three dimensions is topological , as there are no local degrees of freedom .",
    "its first order formulation in terms of a connection @xmath0 and a triad @xmath1 is given by s= _ _ abc e^ar^bc [ ] .",
    "the quantisation of such a theory is rather well understood and different possible quantisation procedures are known .",
    "this is of course in stark contrast to general relativity in four dimensions , whose quantisation is to a large extent still an open problem .",
    "one may try to exploit what is known in 3d to write general relativity in 4d as a _ constrained _ topological theory with action s= _ b^abr_ab [ ] + ^c_[b ] ; one then needs to add constraints ( the  simplicity constraints \" ) which enforce @xmath2 ( for some set of 1-forms @xmath1 ) to recover general relativity .",
    "the main obstacle in quantisation is then the identification and implementation of such constraints , which has indeed been a topic of much recent debate in the discrete setting of spin foam models @xcite .    if , for example as the starting point for loop quantum gravity , one wants to add a holst term @xcite to the first order connection form for general relativity , one instead needs to impose @xmath3 on the two - form field @xmath4 , defined in terms of @xmath5 by ^ab=(b^ab-_cdb^cd ) ( note that this is just a linear redefinition ) .",
    "we will focus on this case in the following and try to determine an appropriate set of constraints for @xmath4 .    in the traditional ( plebanski ) formulation @xcite ,",
    "quadratic constraints _ for @xmath4 , _ abcd^ab_ab^cd_cd = v_abcd , which have two _ separate _ sectors of solutions !",
    "@xmath6 configurations are not geometric at all , leading to additional potential difficulties in quantisation @xcite . ] : ^ab = e^ae^b^ab=_cde^ce^d for some set of 1-forms @xmath7 .",
    "classically , one can consistently remain within the  gr \" sector @xcite ; quantum mechanically , the situation is less clear .",
    "the discrete analogue of this construction has been used in spin foam models of quantum gravity : one introduces a triangulation of spacetime , integrates @xmath4 over triangles ^ab_ab(x)^ab__^ab(4)^2 ^4 , and imposes the constraint @xmath8 if @xmath9 or @xmath10 and @xmath11 share an edge .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the remaining  volume \" constraints can be replaced by the  closure constraint \" _ ^ab_=0 .",
    "[ closure ] the quantum - mechanical implementation of these constraints led to the barrett - crane model @xcite .",
    "the recently proposed new spin foam models @xcite , on the other hand , rely on the replacement of quadratic constraints on @xmath12 by _ linear _ constraints : n_a()^ab()=0 , [ linearconst ] where @xmath13 is normal to the tetrahedron @xmath14 .",
    "these are stronger than the quadratic constraints ; they restrict @xmath4 to the discrete analogue of @xmath15 . here",
    "we present an extension of this construction , which was done in the discrete setting , to the _ classical continuum theory _ :",
    "we give a set of constraints whose solution implies that @xmath15 for some @xmath1 ( ignoring the factor @xmath16 in the following ) .",
    "we then discretise these constraints and identify some which are sufficient at the discrete level . for details and proofs of our claims , see @xcite .",
    "clearly , to find a continuum analogue of ( [ linearconst ] ) that is derivable from an action , one has to introduce dynamical fields that play the analogue of the normal vectors @xmath17 in ( [ linearconst ] ) .",
    "we introduce a basis of 1-forms @xmath18 ( i.e. assuming @xmath19 ) , which is dual to a basis of 3-forms by n_adef_adefe^d_d e^e_e e^f_f , e^c_a ~^cdefn_adef . for a basis of 3-forms",
    "@xmath20 , the general solution to n_adef^ab_ab=0\\{a , b}\\{d , e , f } [ con ] is ^ab_ab = g_abe^[a_a e^b]_b , where @xmath7 is defined in terms of @xmath20 as above . note that @xmath21 are functions on spacetime .",
    "one could try a linear redefinition @xmath22 to identify this general solution ^ab_ab",
    "= g_abe^[a_a e^b]_b with @xmath15 , but this is not possible in general ; one needs additional conditions .    in @xcite",
    ", we show that imposing the additional three constraints _ b_\\{a , f}\\{b , e}n_abef^ab_ab=0,e\\{0,1,2 } [ addcon ] implies that @xmath23 is the same function @xmath24 for all @xmath25 , @xmath26 , which can be absorbed by a pointwise rescaling @xmath27 to complete the identification @xmath15 .",
    "note that not the field @xmath7 we have introduced to define the constraints ( [ con ] ) , but the rescaled @xmath1 will play the role of an orthonormal tetrad determining physical lengths and angles . in particular ,",
    "a completely degenerate triad @xmath28 is possible since @xmath29 at some points is not excluded .",
    "the translation of the constraints into discretised variables is straightforward .",
    "again one introduces a triangulation of spacetime and integrates @xmath4 over triangles and @xmath20 over tetrahedra : ^ab_ab , n_adef^ab(),n_a ( ) . then the discrete analogue of the set of constraints ( [ con ] ) is ( essentially by construction ) the set of linear constraints used in the epr(l)/fk models , @xmath30 .",
    "perhaps more interestingly , the discrete version of the remaining constraints ( [ addcon ] ) would take the form _",
    "\\{i , j}n_a(_*i*)^ab(_*aj*)=0 , [ volanalogue ] where we label the tetrahedra in a 4-simplex by @xmath31 ; there are five of these constraints per simplex ( where @xmath32 is replaced by @xmath33 respectively ) .",
    "these constraints play the role of the  volume \" constraints which could be , in the case of quadratic constraints , replaced by a closure constraint relating different triangles in a tetrahedron .",
    "the situation here is completely analogous : +   + * result : * the constraints ( [ volanalogue ] ) follow from the epr(l)/fk linear constraints , the closure constraint on @xmath34 , plus an analogous ",
    "4d closure constraint \" n_a(_*a*)+n_a(_*b*)+n_a(_*c*)+n_a(_*d*)+n_a(_*e*)=0 , [ 4dconst ] which can be given a clear geometric motivation , just as closure on @xmath4 : while the closure constraint ( [ closure ] ) can be interpreted as the requirement for the triangles specified by @xmath12 to close up to form a tetrahedron , or alternatively as the discrete version of the field equation @xmath35}=0 $ ] integrated over an infinitesimal 3-ball , the four - dimensional constraint ( [ 4dconst ] ) can be interpreted as demanding that the five tetrahedra specified by @xmath36 close up to form a 4-simplex .",
    "the derivation of ( [ 4dconst ] ) from a continuum field equation is more subtle since one has to assume both @xmath35}=0 $ ] and the identification of @xmath4 with @xmath7 to obtain the equation @xmath37}=0 $ ] .",
    "we have established a formulation of classical general relativity as a topological bf theory plus linear constraints which relied on the introduction of a basis of 3-forms at each point in addition to the two - form field @xmath4 and the connection @xmath0 .",
    "this new continuum action is more closely related to current spin foam models , such as the epr(l ) and fk models , as discretising it leads to variables @xmath38 which appear in these spin foam models , and are subject to the constraints used in these models , plus closure constraints on both @xmath4 and @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is a new constraint which has been suggested before , but not received much attention in the literature so far .",
    "it suggests a new formulation for spin foam models in which the normals @xmath20 carry information about the 3-volume and thus are given a fully geometric role , other than in the current models where one can set them to a fixed value .",
    "other than searching for a modification of spin foam models in this direction , one should perform a detailed canonical analysis of the constraints used in our formulation .",
    "there are also indications for a close relation of our constructions both to current research in group field theories , as well as to the  edge simplicity \" constraints introduced in @xcite .",
    "we leave all this to future work .",
