    "let @xmath0 be a real @xmath2 symmetric matrix with simple spectrum @xmath3 when is a matrix simultaneously an orthogonal and an upper triangular conjugation of @xmath0 ?",
    "more precisely , we consider the _ slice _ @xmath1 through @xmath0 , defined to be the intersection of the sets @xmath4 , for arbitrary real orthogonal matrices @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 for arbitrary real upper triangular matrices @xmath8 with @xmath9    how large is a slice ? clearly , if @xmath10 then @xmath11 , and hence , since @xmath0 has simple spectrum , @xmath12 for some ( real ) polynomial @xmath13 .",
    "the matrices @xmath5 and @xmath8 are uniquely determined from @xmath14 if @xmath14 is invertible : this is the standard _ qr - factorization _ of a matrix ( @xcite ) . for convenience ,",
    "we write @xmath15_q } } { { \\big [ { f(s ) } \\big]_r}}$ ] .",
    "slices have been appearing in disguised form in the literature of numerical analysis and integrable systems , and questions about the geometry of slices have come up intermittently . by putting these three aspects side by side , we expect to convince the reader that the concept is indeed a natural one .",
    "francis , in his fundamental work on the @xmath16 algorithm ( @xcite ) considered the following map between matrices .",
    "take @xmath0 invertible symmetric , factor @xmath17 and define the _ @xmath16 step _",
    "it is clear that @xmath19 is symmetric with the same spectrum of @xmath0 , since @xmath20 .",
    "but more is true : @xmath21 . in particular , as francis had already pointed out , @xmath0 and @xmath19 have the same bandwidth ( the reader should compare this argument with the usual one @xcite ) . also , @xmath19 belongs to the slice through @xmath0 : in the notation for the elements of @xmath1 presented in the introduction , @xmath19 is associated to the function @xmath22 .",
    "numerical analysts also know well that @xmath23_q^t } } s { { \\big [ { s^k } \\big]_q}}$ ] equals the matrix obtained by applying @xmath24 times the @xmath16 step starting from @xmath0 : in other words , @xmath25 is the @xmath24-th step of the @xmath16 iteration starting from @xmath26 .",
    "again , @xmath25 belongs to @xmath1 , and is associated to @xmath27 .    instead , by taking @xmath28 ,",
    "the resulting matrix @xmath29 is , in a precise sense , the @xmath30-th @xmath16 step . taking the limit ( @xcite ) @xmath31 yields a vector field @xmath32",
    ", whose solution @xmath33 starting at @xmath34 at time @xmath24 equals @xmath25 !",
    "the computation of this limit appears in a number of arguments in the subject .",
    "the expression for @xmath35 is @xmath36_q^t } } s { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } , \\hbox { where   } s^{\\epsilon } = { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r}}.\\ ] ] evaluating the derivatives in @xmath37 , we learn that @xmath38_q^t } } ) s{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } + { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q^t } } s ( \\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q}}),\\ ] ] @xmath39_q } } ) { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r } } + { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q}}(\\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r}}).\\ ] ] from the last equation , @xmath40_q^t } } ( \\log s ) s^{\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r^{-1 } } } =   { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q^t}}(\\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } )   + ( \\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r}}){{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r^{-1}}},\\ ] ] which obtains @xmath40_q^t } } ( \\log s ) { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r } } { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r^{-1 } } }    = \\log s^{(\\epsilon ) } =   { { \\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q^t}}(\\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_q } } )   + ( \\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r}}){{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r^{-1}}}.\\ ] ] now evaluate the derivatives at @xmath41 : we must have @xmath42_q } } { { \\big [ { s^0 } \\big]_r}}$ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "the equation above yields @xmath44_q}}|_{\\epsilon=0 } +   \\frac{d\\ } { d\\epsilon}{{\\big [ { s^{\\epsilon } } \\big]_r}}|_{\\epsilon=0}.\\ ] ] the two terms in the right hand side of the last equation are special matrices : they are respectively skew symmetric and upper triangular . consider the ( unique , linear ) decomposition of a matrix @xmath45 as a sum of a skew symmetric and an upper triangular matrix .",
    "then , from the expression for the derivative of @xmath35 , @xmath46_q}}}|_{{\\epsilon = 0 } } = \\pi_a \\log s$ ] . the vector field which interpolates the @xmath16 iteration then is @xmath47 $ ] .",
    "the iterations and flows defined above lie in @xmath1 . in particular , both preserve the eigenvalues of the initial condition , its symmetry and its bandwidth .    for numerical analysts ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior of the @xmath16 iteration , well known to francis , is of capital importance .",
    "say , for example , that @xmath48 is an arbitrary jacobi matrix ( i.e. , a real , tridiagonal matrix whose entries @xmath49 are strictly positive ) . starting with @xmath48",
    ", the @xmath16 iteration converges to a diagonal matrix @xmath50 .",
    "not only @xmath50 and @xmath48 have the same spectrum but @xmath50 must lie in the closure of @xmath51 , the slice through @xmath48 .",
    "steps of @xmath16 type related to different functional parameters @xmath13 give rise to iterations which , starting from @xmath48 , always converge to diagonal matrices , with diagonal entries consisting of the ( distinct ) eigenvalues of @xmath48 in an arbitrary order .",
    "the closure of the slice @xmath51 clearly ought to contain additional points . in a nutshell",
    ", they correspond to _ reducible _ jacobi matrices , i.e. , matrices for which some entry @xmath52 is zero .",
    "this will be explained in the sequel .",
    "we now describe briefly the toda lattice , which is an integrable system for which slices appear as natural phase spaces .",
    "consider @xmath53 particles on the line with positions @xmath54 and velocities @xmath55 evolving under the hamiltonian    @xmath56    this hamiltonian was introduced as a model of wave propagation in one dimensional crystals ( @xcite ) .",
    "it was flaschka s remarkable discovery ( @xcite ) that this dynamical system is equivalent to the matrix differential equation @xmath57,\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the jacobi matrix with nonzero entries @xmath58    the fact that the differential equation is in the so called _ lax pair form _ ( @xcite ) implies that the evolution @xmath59 is actually an orthogonal conjugation of the initial condition @xmath60 .",
    "but again more is true : the evolution stays within the set of jacobi matrices , as we should expect , since there are no other physically significant variables in the problem ( velocities essentially are the diagonal entries , and distances between particles with neighboring indices correspond to the off - diagonal entries ) .",
    "indeed , it is not hard to check that @xmath61_q^t } } j(0 ) { { \\big [ { e^{t j(0 ) } } \\big]_q } }   = { { \\big [ { e^{t j(0 ) } } \\big]_r } } j(0 ) { { \\big [ { e^{t j(0 ) } } \\big]_r^{-1}}},\\ ] ] the celebrated solution of the toda lattice by factorization ( @xcite ) . to check this formula ,",
    "proceed as in the computation of the limit of the previous section .",
    "thus , again , the orbit @xmath59 lies within the slice through @xmath60 .",
    "moser also computed the asymptotic behavior of the toda lattice ( @xcite ) : for @xmath22 , the orbit @xmath59 starting from a jacobi matrix @xmath60 converges to a diagonal matrix , with eigenvalues disposed in decreasing order .",
    "this is in accordance with the relationship between toda and @xmath16 and has a natural physical interpretation .",
    "diagonal entries are velocities : in the long run , particles move apart and tend to undergo uniform motion , each with speed given by a different eigenvalue . faster particles",
    "move ahead , explaining the orderd outcome of the eigenvalues along the diagonal found in applications of the @xmath16 iteration .",
    "the remarkable fact that asymptotic speeds both at @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the same will not be relevant to us : this is strong evidence of the integrability of the system  each orbit remembers this data .",
    "other matrices belonging to the boundary of the slice through @xmath60 correspond to asymptotic behavior in which the system of particles breaks into essentially disconnected components , the so called _ clustering_.    for a symmetric matrix @xmath0 and an arbitrary function @xmath64 , the matrix equation @xmath65 $ ] admits a similar solution by factorization : conjugate the initial condition by @xmath66_q}}$ ] .",
    "it is this last fact which historically was responsible for relating the @xmath16 iteration and toda flows ( @xcite , @xcite ) : when @xmath67 , the resulting differential equation gives rise to the orbits interpolating the @xmath16 iteration .",
    "for applications of these differential equations to numerical analysis , the reader may consult @xcite .",
    "detailed study of variables for which the toda flow becomes especially simple led moser ( @xcite ) to a parametrization of jacobi matrices .",
    "it turns out that jacobi matrices have simple spectrum and its eigenvectors always have nonzero first coordinates  in particular , they can be normalized so as to have ( strictly ) positive first coordinates .",
    "moser proved that the map taking jacobi matrices to @xmath53-uples of distinct real numbers ( the eigenvalues ) and a point in the first octant of the unit sphere in @xmath68 ( the first coordinates of the normalized eigenvectors ) is a diffeomorphism .",
    "he then showed that an appropriate choice of toda flow ( i.e. , of functional parameter @xmath64 ) gives rise to orbits joining any two jacobi matrices with the same spectrum .",
    "thus , given a jacobi matrix @xmath48 , @xmath51 is the set of all jacobi matrices with the same spectrum as @xmath48 .",
    "( we remind the reader that jacobi matrices always have simple spectrum . ) from moser s parametrization , _",
    "jacobi slices _ are diffeomorphic to @xmath69 .    more generally , getting back to the definition of slices , we have seen that a matrix @xmath70 is of the form @xmath71 , where @xmath72 for some function @xmath13 .",
    "keeping account of the requests on @xmath5 and @xmath8 , one may obtain a simple coordinatization of a slice .",
    "a matrix @xmath0 is _ irreducible _ if @xmath0 has no invariant subspace generated by a subset of the canonical vectors @xmath73 .",
    "indeed , there is a diffeomorphism between positive polynomials up to scalar multiplication and elements of @xmath1 , for an irreducible symmetric matrix ( @xcite ) .    which matrices are in the boundary @xmath74 of the slice through a jacobi matrix @xmath48 ?",
    "numerical analysts knew that the diagonal matrix @xmath75 and its permuted counterparts @xmath76 .",
    "as we shall see , the simplest possible way of combining such @xmath77 points to form a reasonable boundary turns out to be the topological description of @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the _ permutohedron _ , obtained by taking the convex closure of the points of the form @xmath79 .",
    "notice that actually @xmath78 has an interior of dimension @xmath80 , since the sum of the coordinates of any point in @xmath78 equals the trace of @xmath48 .",
    "the permutohedron @xmath78 is homeomorphic to the closure of @xmath51 , as was proved in @xcite with combinatorial arguments .",
    "the figure below describes the situation for a @xmath81 jacobi matrix @xmath48 with spectrum @xmath82 . on",
    "the left is a topological representation of the closure of the slice @xmath51 .",
    "interior points of the hexagon are points in @xmath51 .",
    "the boundary consists of two kinds of points : the six diagonal matrices , corresponding to the vertices , and the matrices which form the edges , which have either entry @xmath83 or @xmath84 equal to zero . on the right ,",
    "the permutohedron associated to @xmath85 is projected on the @xmath86 plane .",
    "notice that a map taking vertices to vertices , say , taking @xmath87 to @xmath88 and @xmath89 to @xmath90 may not behave so navely on all vertices , for continuity reasons .",
    "the permutohedron associated to a jacobi @xmath91 matrices is also drawn below .",
    "faces have a clear meaning : there must be four hexagons associated to matrices for which entry @xmath83 equals zero ( and hence contained a jacobi @xmath81 block of fixed spectrum ) , six quadrilaterals corresponding to matrices with entry @xmath84 equal to zero , and four more hexagons for matrices with entry @xmath92 equal to zero .",
    "there are also @xmath93 vertices .",
    "the permutohedron is familiar to spectral theorists , from the well known schur - horn theorem ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be a symmetric matrix with simple spectrum @xmath94 , and consider the set @xmath95 .",
    "then the map @xmath96 is surjective from @xmath97 to @xmath78 .",
    "such a map is highly not injective .",
    "slices are in a sense minimal sets in @xmath97 in bijection with permutohedra .",
    "the presence of a convex polytope raised the possibility of relating slices to moment maps of symplectic toroidal actions ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "indeed , following this route , bloch flaschka and ratiu obtained an _ explicit _ diffeomorphism between the closure of @xmath51 and @xmath78 , which we now describe .",
    "let @xmath0 be a symmetric matrix with simple spectrum , and consider the spectral decomposition @xmath98 , where , as usual , @xmath5 is orthogonal and @xmath99 is diagonal .",
    "now , order the diagonal entries of @xmath99 in descending order : @xmath5 is then defined up to a choice of sign for each column of @xmath100 ( since they are normalized eigenvectors of @xmath0 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath101 , for some diagonal matrix @xmath50 of signs .",
    "the matrix @xmath102 is dependent on @xmath50 , but its diagonal is not ! the map @xmath103 is the _ bfr map_. its restriction to the closure of a jacobi slice @xmath51 is the required diffeomorphism to @xmath78 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the proof of the result above makes use of sophisticated machinery .",
    "however , once we knew what had to be proved , a simpler argument appeared , yielding a more general result ( @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath0 be an arbitrary real , symmetric , irreducible matrix with simple spectrum .",
    "call the diagonal matrices in the closure of @xmath1 _ accessible _ , and their images under the bfr map the _",
    "accessible vertices_. now let @xmath104 , the _ spectral polytope _ of @xmath0 , be the convex closure of the accessible vertices of @xmath0 .      generically , the spectral polytope of a symmetric matrix with simple spectrum is indeed the permutohedron associated to the @xmath77 diagonal arrangements of the eigenvalues .",
    "but this is not the case in general .",
    "a self - contained description of the spectral polytope of an irreducible matrix @xmath0 is as follows . consider the spectral decomposition , @xmath98 .",
    "we denote by @xmath105 the minor of @xmath5 consisting of the entries in the intersection of rows with indices @xmath106 with columns with indices in @xmath107 . for a permutation @xmath108 in @xmath53 symbols ,",
    "let @xmath109 denote the permutation matrix with entries @xmath110 .",
    "as an example , let @xmath98 be a @xmath81 matrix with eigenvalues @xmath113 , and so that the entry @xmath114 equals zero , but no other minor of @xmath5 has determinat equal to zero .",
    "the slice @xmath1 and the spectral polytope have only four vertices : diagonal matrices with entry @xmath115 equal to 4 do not belong to @xmath116 , and the vertices of the spectral polytope are @xmath117 and @xmath118  @xmath116 is a quadrilateral .",
