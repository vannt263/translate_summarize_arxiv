    "more than 30 members among the group of late a magnetic chemically peculiar stars exhibit high - overtone , low - degree , non - radial @xmath2-mode pulsations with periods in the range of 621 minutes @xcite . these _ rapidly oscillating ap _ ( roap ) stars are characterized by strong global magnetic fields with a polar strengths of the order of 110 kg .",
    "the atmospheres of roap stars are enriched with heavy elements , brought up from the stellar interior by diffusion .",
    "conspicuous lateral and vertical variations of chemical abundances in ap stars and the prominence of the magnetic field signatures make them primary targets for detailed investigations of the magnetic topology and magnetically driven formation of structures in stellar atmospheres ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the observed pulsational amplitudes of roap stars are modulated according to the visible magnetic field structure .",
    "this observation led to the oblique pulsator model @xcite , where axisymmetric @xmath3 modes are aligned with the magnetic field axis , which itself is oblique to the axis of stellar rotation .",
    "calculations by @xcite showed that dipolar modes are significantly distorted by a magnetic field of kg - strength , but retain their axisymmetric character . on the other hand",
    ", the structure of pulsational perturbations can include significant non - axisymmetric components in weak - field stars @xcite .",
    "the indirect pulsation doppler imaging of oscillations in the prototype roap stars hr3831 @xcite vindicated the oblique pulsator model and for the first time characterized observationally the magnetic distortion of the global _ p-_modes .",
    "the roap stars are key objects for asteroseismology , which presently is the most powerful tool for testing theories of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the classical asteroseismic analysis , utilizing precise frequency measurements , helps to constrain the luminosity and internal chemical composition of pulsating magnetic stars ( e.g. matthews , kurtz & martinez @xcite ; cunha , fernandes & monteiro @xcite ) .",
    "recent time - resolved spectroscopic observations of roap stars uitilizing large telescopes ( see review by @xcite ) demonstrated the possibility of another type of asteroseismic investigation , which is focused on the upper atmospheric layers .",
    "a significant chemical stratification and a short vertical wavelength of pulsation modes lead to a remarkable diversity of the pulsational characteristics observed in individual spectral lines , notably of absorption lines of the rare - earth elements ( ree ) ( e.g. , @xcite ; mkrtichian , hatzes & kanaan @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the information extracted from the lines formed at different optical depths opens access to different modes and can be combined to yield a vertical tomographic map of the pulsating stellar atmosphere @xcite .",
    "thus , applying doppler imaging techniques and pulsation tomography to line profile variation in roap stars promises an unprecedented 3-d picture of magnetoacoustic pulsations @xcite .",
    "these spectacular results have been obtained despite the fact that most spectroscopic observations of roap stars were obtained in a snapshot mode and hence cover only a few hours of stellar oscillations .",
    "a detailed frequency analysis is highly ambiguous with such limited data , because of the well known aliasing problem .",
    "it can only marginally improved by combining observations from several nights , but which rarely are available when large telescopes had to be used . therefore , despite an outstanding clarity of the pulsation curves often produced with spectroscopy , for most multiperiodic roap stars they correspond to an unresolved mixture of different modes and thus are exceedingly difficult to interpret .",
    "this fundamental problem can be alleviated by simultaneous photometric observations with a high duty cycle , as it was successfully demonstrated by a combination of space photometry of the roap star hd24712 with contemporaneous vlt / uves spectroscopy @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present an analysis of a much more extensive spectroscopic time series for another pulsating ap star , 10aql , which was observed simultaneously from ground and space .",

    "@xcite have included 10aql in their study of the evolutionary state of magnetic chemically peculiar stars . adopting a photometric temperature = 7900k , they found @xmath4=@xmath10@xmath6 , @xmath11=@xmath12 and a fractional age of 6476% of the main sequence lifetime .",
    "the abundance pattern of 10aql is characteristic of a cool ap star .",
    "a notable spectral anomaly is the overabundance of the doubly ionized rees ,  and .",
    "a longitudinal magnetic field of about 500 g was detected in 10aql by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . using magnetic zeeman splitting in unpolarized spectra @xcite",
    "provided the first measurement of the mean magnetic field modulus in 10aql , @xmath13=@xmath14 kg , which later was confirmed by leone , vacca & stift ( @xcite ) , and he estimated the projected rotational velocity = 2.0 .",
    "the sharpness of spectral lines and the absence of measurable variations of the mean longitudinal magnetic field indicate that 10aql has a long rotational period .",
    "recently , ryabchikova , kochukhov & bagnulo ( @xcite ) have studied the vertical stratification and isotope anomaly of ca in a number of ap stars , including 10aql .",
    "these authors found a concentration of ca in deeper atmospheric layers and invoked a vertical separation of the ca isotopes to explain the shape of the ca  infrared triplet lines .",
    "a comprehensive chemical stratification analysis of 10aql is currently underway by nesvacil et al ( in preparation ) , but already a preliminary result ( nesvacil , weiss & kochukhov @xcite ) shows that si , ca , cr , fe , and sr share a qualitatively similar vertical abundance distribution , characterized by a rapid increase of the element abundances below @xmath15 . a re - determination of the atmospheric parameters taking into account individual chemical abundances and stratification supports the spectroscopic @xmath167600k obtained by @xcite .",
    "photometric variations with a period close to 11.4min and an amplitude below 0.5mmag were discovered in 10aql by @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified three pulsation modes with periods of 11.0613.45min , based on 26h of high - speed photometry in the @xmath17-band . despite an aliasing problem in their data , @xcite were able to determine the large frequency separation , @xmath18@xmath19hz .",
    "belmonte , martinez roger & roca cortes ( @xcite ) collected 47h of time - resolved photometry in the @xmath20-band , confirming oscillations in 10aql .",
    "moreover , their study suggested that the amplitude of the infrared photometric variations significantly exceeds variations in the @xmath17-band , which is unusual for a roap star ( e.g. martinez , sekiguchi & hashimoto @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , no oscillations were detected in the follow - up photometric monitoring conducted in the @xmath21-band ( belmonte , kreidl & martinez roger @xcite ) .",
    "radial velocity variations with previously known oscillation periods were discovered in 10aql by @xcite . over two nights",
    "they observed the star during a total of 8h in a short wavelength region centred at @xmath226150 .",
    "unlike the majority of other roap stars , 10aql showed only a weak variability with an amplitude of @xmath1630  in the strong nd  6145  line , but exhibited amplitudes at the level of 80130 in the lines of first ree ions , gd  and eu . aiming to extend the study of pulsational variation of 10aql , @xcite analysed spectra covering 11.6h of time - resolved observations during three nights .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , despite a broad wavelength coverage of their data , @xcite were able to confirm the presence of rv variations in only 5 individual spectral lines , two of which remained unidentified .",
    "the authors found the highest rv amplitude of 400  in an unidentified line at @xmath22  5471.42  but could not detect pulsations in strong doubly ionized ree lines which show prominent variability in other roap stars .",
    "in addition to its remarkably low - amplitude photometric pulsational variations , 10aql seems to exhibit an unusual spectroscopic pulsational behaviour , making this star perhaps an intermediate object between high - amplitude roap stars and apparently constant non - pulsating magnetic ap stars .",
    "10aql was chosen as a target for an extensive observing campaign by the canadian photometric space telescope most @xcite .",
    "the star was observed as a primary target in june - july 2006 , and nearly 120000 10s exposures were collected during 31d at a sampling interval of 20s .",
    "the frequency analysis by @xcite revealed three definite periodicities and two candidate frequencies ( see table[mostf ] ) .",

    "showed that the two largest amplitude peaks reported by @xcite are 1d@xmath23 aliases of the intrinsic stellar frequencies @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the third significant most frequency , @xmath26mhz , has not been detected in previous photometric observations of 10aql .",

    "the presence of chemical stratification in the atmospheres of ap stars offers a unique possibility to resolve the vertical structure of pulsation modes . however , the line - forming regions for ree are difficult to derive .",
    "atmospheric modelling for such purposes should account for chemical stratification , deviations from local thermodynamical equilibrium ( lte ) , magnetic field , and , eventually , pulsation effects on the shape and intensity of spectral lines with substantial rv variability .",
    "the formidable difficulties of such an elaborated theoretical approach explain why up to now nd and pr line formation calculations accounting for nlte and magnetic field effects in chemically stratified atmosphere have been carried out only for two roap stars , @xmath30  equ and hd24712 ( mashonkina , ryabchikova & ryabtsev @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the assumption that the line intensity or equivalent width represents a proxy of the relative formation heights , frequently used in early roap pulsation studies ( e.g. @xcite ) , is only justified for the same element , respectively ion .",
    "it is now well established that stratification effects are dominant in the atmospheres of cool ap stars and , therefore , the formation region of the weak lines of one element is not necessarily located deeper in the atmosphere than for strong lines of another element . consequently , discussing pulsation amplitude or phase versus line depth in context of pulsation modes can be grossly misleading .",
    "@xcite suggested a different approach to the pulsation tomography problem based on the assumption of a continuous amplitude versus phase relation for an outward propagating magnetoacoustic wave .",
    "they proposed to use phase - amplitude diagrams to diagnose the structure of pulsation modes based on the following arguments : if one neglects surface chemical inhomogeneity ( which is a reasonable assumption for slow - rotating roap stars ) , then both phase and amplitude may provide information on the relative line formation depth .",
    "for instance , a phase - independent growth of the amplitudes measured for groups of lines belonging to different chemical species corresponds to a standing wave in the layers where these chemical species are formed . in the case of a phase - dependent amplitude trend , the lines showing later rv maximum should originate higher in the atmosphere . in the general case",
    "the vertical pulsation structure of roap stars is likely to be a superposition of standing and running waves , corresponding to the decoupled magnetic and acoustic pulsation components which have different depth dependence @xcite . in the same star pulsations in certain ions",
    "may trace the standing , magnetic part of the wave while other ions may show predominantly the running , acoustic component .",
    "the phase - amplitude diagram method is well - suited to characterize this behaviour thus offering the possibility of tracing the vertical properties of pulsation waves and studying the physics of magneto - acoustic oscillations from trends of pulsation velocity amplitude and pulsation phase without tedious assignment of the physical depth to each pulsation measurement .",
    "the key assumption used in interpreting the phase - amplitude diagrams is that a later rv maximum corresponds to a higher line formation .",
    "this is supported by the gradual increase of pulsation phase with height from h@xmath31- , h@xmath0-cores to nd-  ",
    "pr-  lines ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in practically all roap stars where formation heights of pulsating lines could be constrained independently of the pulsation analysis @xcite . since the chemical properties of most roap stars are quite similar @xcite and their phase - amplitude dependences are also comparable @xcite , the assumption of continuous outward increase of pulsation phase appears to be reasonable from the empirical point of view . on the other hand , the general validity of this picture has been questioned in the theoretical work by @xcite . these authors demonstrated that using a certain combination of the model parameters ( not applicable to 10aql or to any other roap star ) , one can obtain a complex superposition of standing and outwardly propagating waves which would mimic an inwardly running wave .",
    "this situation may complicate interpretation of the phase - amplitude diagrams , and the case of 33lib ( sect.[33lib ] ) possibly represents an example of such complex situation .",
    "however , a more realistic theoretical modelling using pulsation and atmospheric parameters relevant for specific roap stars is required to confirm the reality of such complex depth dependence of pulsation phase .",
    "similar to the analysis of 10 roap stars presented by @xcite , we applied the amplitude - phase diagram method to 10aql .",
    "furthermore , the availability of our rich spectroscopic observational material allows us to improve the precision of our previous analysis which was presented at the cp#ap workshop in 2007 by @xcite , and for the first time to recover the amplitude - phase diagrams for several pulsation modes in the same roap star .",
    "these diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "[ rv - ph ] for the 3 main frequencies observed in 10aql .    for the purpose of comparison ,",
    "we plot bisector measurements across the h@xmath0 core in the amplitude - phase diagrams constructed via centre - of - gravity measurements .",
    "these measurements provide us with a physical depth scale in the atmosphere because hydrogen is distributed homogeneously with height .",
    "the core of the h@xmath0 line is formed in the region between @xmath32 and @xmath33 according to nlte calculations using the codes described in @xcite ,     +   +    as in other roap stars , measurable pulsation amplitudes appear in the layers where eu , la , and the core of h@xmath0 are formed , reach maximum and then show decrease of the amplitude .",
    "the phase increases by 0.2 across the h@xmath0-line core while the rv amplitude grows by 45 times .",
    "we observe a running wave - like behaviour in this part of the stellar atmosphere . above the formation height of the deepest point of the h@xmath0 profile ( @xmath34 ) the amplitude continues to grow rapidly without significant phase change .",
    "however , while in most other roap stars the maximum rv amplitudes are observed in singly and doubly ionised nd and pr lines , in 10aql the maximum are seen for the lines of ce , dy  and a couple of unidentified lines too , attributed by us to dy .",
    "the lines of nd and pr are formed above the dy  lines and show a rv amplitude rapidly falling to very small values . in even higher layers ,",
    "the pulsation amplitude starts to grow again and reaches a new maximum in lines of tb .",
    "simultaneously , the pulsation phase changes by @xmath350.5 between the two maxima .",
    "this is a typical picture of a pulsation node in the stellar atmosphere : the phase changes by @xmath36 while on both sides of the phase jump we observe comparable rv amplitudes .",
    "the presence of the node is supported by the bisector measurements in nd  lines ( see below ) .",
    "if the optical depth scale indicated by the core of the h@xmath0 line is valid for other lines too , then we expect that the pulsation node is located near or above the optical depth of @xmath37 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the amplitude and phase distributions with height in the atmospheres of roap stars is expected to depend on the local magnetic field strength and inclination @xcite .",
    "thus , the inferred location of the node observed in the disk - integrated quantities represents the average of the local vertical pulsation structure which , possibly , exhibits substantial variation over the stellar surface .",
    "ideally one should take this variation into account when determining the exact vertical location of the node .     +    among the lines of elements other than rare earths only the strongest line of y , @xmath22  5662.9   , shows low - amplitude but definite pulsation . as in most other roap stars",
    "@xcite , this line overlaps with pr  lines in the amplitude - phase diagrams .",
    "the amplitude - phase diagrams for the three pulsation modes are very similar except , perhaps , gd  and la  lines . only 4 out of 14 gd  lines have equivalent widths larger than 7 m . also , most of gd  lines are shallow due to substantial magnetic splitting ; their central depth does not exceed 45 % .",
    "this makes pulsation measurements difficult .",
    "pulsations can be detected in all gd , and it seems that this element shows higher amplitudes for the 11.51 and 11.68 min periods .",
    "the same situation is found for la  lines , which have even lower equivalent widths and lower rv amplitudes .",
    "this discrepant variation of the gd  and la  lines for different frequencies may indicate a difference in the vertical extension of the corresponding modes .",
    "in particular , on the basis of these measurements , one may suspect that the frequency @xmath25 ( @xmath38 min ) corresponds to a pulsation mode located in higher atmospheric layers compared to @xmath24 and @xmath39 .",
    "this agrees with the difference between photometric and spectroscopic amplitude ratios for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the rv amplitudes and phases across the h@xmath0 core are shown in fig.[halpha ] as a function of the normalized flux ( scale at the bottom ) and optical depth ( scale at the top ) for all three principal pulsation periods seen in 10aql .",
    "we find very similar behaviour for the three modes .",
    "in fact , the amplitudes of @xmath24 and @xmath25 are identical within error bars , whereas the amplitude of @xmath39 is slightly lower .",
    "this suggests that the three modes sample the hydrogen line core formation region in a similar manner .    because of the weakness of most spectral lines , the only metal line suitable for a precise bisector analysis is nd  5102.43  ",
    "this line is deep enough and its wings are free from blends . in many roap stars",
    "this nd   line is blended with nd  5102.39    and should be used with caution . however , due to the overall weakness of the nd  spectrum in 10aql , the blending effect is negligible .",
    "bisector measurements across the nd  5102    line profile are shown in fig .",
    "[ bis_nd ] .",
    "a phase jump of approximately 0.40.5 seems to be located in similar atmospheric layers for all three main frequencies .",
    "a bisector analysis provides an independent evidence for the pulsation node in the upper atmosphere of 10aql .",
    "this is the second case after 33lib ( @xcite ; kurtz , elkin & mathys @xcite ; @xcite ) of a pulsation node found in a roap star located within the ree - rich cloud .",
    "nd  5102    line provides the most clear signatures of the pulsation node : phase jump of @xmath350.5 of the period accompanied by the minimum in rv distribution .",
    "the start of the phase jump is seen in other nd  lines as illustrated by fig.6 of @xcite . in nd  6145",
    "line it also reaches @xmath40 , however , we did not analyze this line due to its known blend with sii  line that influences bisector rv values .",
    "another strong nd  6237  line was omitted from the bisector analysis , too , because it is blended in the red wing by one of sm , an element which also shows pulsation , but probably is formed deeper in the atmosphere ( see our fig.[rv - ph ] ) .    in comparison to the bisector variation in the h@xmath0 core , the nd  5102    bisectors behave differently for the three modes .",
    "the amplitude in the outer wings is the highest for @xmath25 , whereas the steepest phase jump is seen for @xmath39 .",
    "based on the location of the maximum change of the bisector phase further outside in the wings , we tentatively conclude that the node region is located somewhat deeper for the @xmath39 mode than for the other two frequencies .",
    "many cool ap stars exhibit an unusually large broadening of the doubly ionized nd and pr lines , for which macroturbulent velocities of the order of 10  are often needed to achieve a good fit to the observed line profiles @xcite .",
    "the nature of this phenomenon is poorly understood , but it could be related to a turbulent instability in the upper atmospheric layers , possibly caused by the anomalous temperature gradient produced by a stratified distribution of the chemical elements . although roap stars are the ones most frequently showing this anomaly , it does not correlate with pulsation amplitude and is equally strong in stars in which pulsations at the level of 2030  are barely detectable @xcite . as discussed by @xcite",
    "the modulation of turbulence by the periodic contraction and expansion of the pulsating atmosphere in roap stars with higher amplitudes explains the characteristic asymmetric line profile variation of the ree lines , first detected by @xcite in @xmath30  equ .",
    "10aql , too , shows remarkably broad lines of nd , but curiously we find that the strongest of these lines are also extremely asymmetric .",
    "this effect is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ lp ] for several nd  lines . in this figure",
    "we show rare - earth line profiles in the spectra of four slowly rotating roap stars : two stars with a small magnetic field , 10aql ( = 7550  k , = 4.0 , = 2.0  , @xmath13=1.5  kg ) and hd  12932 ( = 7620  k , = 4.2 , = 2.0  , @xmath13=1.7  kg ) , and two stars with a large magnetic field , 33lib ( = 7550  k , = 4.3 , @xmath412.0  , @xmath13=5  kg ) and @xmath30  equ ( = 7700  k , = 4.2 , @xmath411.0  , @xmath13=4.1  kg ) @xcite .",
    "for a comparison the profile of the magnetically insensitive non - pulsating ( or weakly - pulsating ) fei  5434 line is also shown for all stars . the wavelength scale is expressed in velocity units relative to the line centres .",
    "the strongest nd  lines in 10aql at @xmath22 5102 and 5294    have a remarkable blue asymmetric wing reaching out to @xmath1  .",
    "the red wing stops at @xmath1620  as do both wings in the nd  lines in the other roap stars shown in fig.[lp ] . in 10aql",
    "the blue wing asymmetry is still prominent in nd  6145    and gradually disappears for weaker nd  lines .",
    "the profiles of strongly and weakly pulsating lines in hd12932 and @xmath30equ are symmetric . in 33lib",
    "the weakly pulsating fei  5434    line is symmetric while ree lines have a small red asymmetry . in 10aql",
    "the non - pulsating fei  5434    line has a clearly asymmetric red wing .",
    "the available information is insufficient to attribute ree line asymmetries either to non - radial pulsations or to an anisotropic turbulent velocity field .",
    "the sign of the asymmetry suggests an outward flow of nd - rich material in the layers probed by the wings of strong nd  lines .",
    "however , this effect can be mimicked by a nonisotropic velocity distribution of an ion stably stratified in the upper stellar atmosphere , as discussed by @xcite for sr in hotter cp stars .",
    "a similar investigation is needed for ree in cool ap stars to shed light on the abnormal shapes of strong nd lines in 10aql .",
    "a comparison of the average spectra obtained in five uves nights over a period of about 1 month did not show any hint of line profile or radial velocity changes on time scales of days .",
    "this supports the study by @xcite who have used own mean longitudinal field measurements and data taken from the literature to argue for a long rotational period of 10aql . to search for long - term variations",
    "we have compared the average uves spectra with observations obtained in 2001 with the gecko coud spectrograph at the 3.6 m canada - france - hawaii telescope @xcite .",
    "we introduced additional broadening to the latter spectra to compensate for the difference in spectral resolution between gecko and uves .",
    "the global average spectrum of 10aql in the 61406165    region and the residual spectra to this average are presented in fig.[longvar ] .",
    "a signature of weak variability can be seen in the centres of few strong lines of cai , fe , ba , nd , as well as in the moderately weak cr  line .",
    "we are confident that this variability is not an artifact due to using different spectrographs , because the intensity variations of cai , fe , ba  lines are in _ antiphase _ with the variations of nd  and cr  lines .",
    "possibly , this is another evidence for a rotational modulation in the spectra of 10aql , indicating a long rotation period .",
    "the additional spectroscopic frequencies could offer a new view on the large frequency separation @xmath42 , a crucial factor for asteroseismology which is directly connected to the mean density in the star and describes the separation of consecutive radial overtones for high - order acoustic pulsation .",
    "figure  [ spacing ] shows a schematic amplitude spectrum including all intrinsic and candidate frequencies of both most photometry and spectroscopy . to first view",
    ", there is no apparent equal spacing visible .",
    "if we consider the four frequencies with high s / n ( solid lines ) to estimate the spacing , the only reasonable solution corresponds to @xmath43hz , a value already noted by @xcite .",
    "lower values ( such as 20 or 30@xmath19hz ) although seem tempting , would however contradict the previously determined temperature and luminosity of 10aql ( see fig . 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "assuming @xmath44hz to be correct , fig.[spacing ] shows the expected position of other radial orders for three different spherical degrees @xmath45 ( vertical dashed , dotted and dashed - dotted lines , respectively ) based on the position of the * four highest * s / n peaks . evidently , the agreement is not very convincing .",
    "nevertheless , an average deviation of about 5@xmath19hz ( which is needed to align the observed values to the expected position ) is about the order of the frequency shifts of consecutive radial overtones due to the magnetic field perturbation as predicted by theory ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it must be noted , however , that such suggestion can lead to ( almost ) any desired result and therefore have to be considered with extreme caution .    generally , the frequencies we derived from spectroscopy do not contradict to those from most photometry .",
    "but spectroscopic data provide an additional information useful for modelling .",
    "according to @xcite the best model describing the pulsation features in 10aql derived from spectroscopy corresponds to a star of 1.95@xmath46 , = 7730 k and normal solar composition with the boundary reflection layer at @xmath47 .",
    "the spectroscopic analysis reveals a pulsation node in the nd  - nd  line formation region .",
    "a non - lte analysis of these lines suggested that they are formed in roap stars in atmospheric layers above @xmath48 @xcite , thus indicating the position of the node .",
    "indeed , a pulsation node is predicted at @xmath48 in a star of 1.95@xmath46 , = 7730 k but assuming helium depletion ( saio , private communication ) , which would better correspond to the typical chemistry of a magnetic peculiar star .",
    "therefore , combining simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic observations , we expect to improve the pulsation model of 10aql .",
    "this analysis will be presented in the next paper .      here , as in many other recent studies of pulsational rv variations of roap stars , we interpret the measurements of amplitude and phase in terms of outward propagation of pulsation waves in a chemically stratified stellar atmosphere .",
    "previously , this interpretation of spectroscopic observations of multiperiodic roap stars was handicapped by short spectroscopic time series which did not allow to resolve frequency patterns of multiperiodic pulsators . here",
    "we overcome this difficulty by combining time - resolved observations acquired during several nights , but with a poor duty cycle , with a continuous photometric monitoring by most at the same time .",
    "this strategy allows us to resolve the vertical structure of the three principal modes in 10aql and to study the propagation of pulsation waves independently for all three frequencies .",
    "we detect a radial node in the region sampled by the formation heights of nd and pr for all three frequencies .",
    "the maximum amplitudes are observed for the  and tb  lines that are presumably formed below and above the region of the node .",
    "the existence of a node is supported by the bisector analysis of the  5102  line .    by attributing the differences in the rv curves of different ree ions to the vertical structure of oscillations we have implicitly assumed that different species sample the horizontal structure of pulsation modes in a similar manner .",
    "this might not be the case if the vertical distribution of pulsation amplitude and phase depends strongly on the stellar surface position due to a spotty element distribution combined with an intrinsic dependency of the mode structures on the orientation and strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the importance of the latter effect , arising from a superposition of magnetic and acoustic components of pulsation waves , has been recently emphasized by @xcite .    due to a long rotation period we are unable to constrain the surface abundance distribution of 10aql in the same way as it could be done for rapidly rotating roap stars @xcite .",
    "for this reason it is not straightforward to distinguish between the vertical and horizontal structural effects . at the same time",
    "we see only small changes in the line profiles in a comparison of observations obtained in 2001 and 5 years later .",
    "furthermore , the independent evidence for a node provided by phase - amplitude diagrams and bisector analyses of different ree ions suggests that the observed phase variation corresponds rather to a vertical structure and not to a different horizontal sampling of the stellar surface .",
    "a comparison of the pulsation properties of 33lib and 10aql is of considerable interest because these are the only roap stars with clear signatures of a radial node in the upper atmosphere .",
    "@xcite performed a pulsation analysis of 33lib using phase - amplitude diagrams , which enable a direct comparison of the vertical pulsation structure in two stars .",
    "the top panel of fig.[33lib_ph - rv_all ] displays the phase - amplitude diagram for 33lib , while bisector measurements of  lines are compared for both stars in the bottom panel of fig.[33lib_ph - rv_all ] .",
    "a pulsation node is clearly present in the atmospheres of both stars but the phase jump has opposite sign .",
    "taking into account that the ree elements are concentrated in the upper atmospheric layers close to or even above the h@xmath0 line core formation zone , we can conclude from figs.[rv - ph ] and [ 33lib_ph - rv_all ] that the phase changes by 0.5 between the formation zones of dy  and tb  in the upper atmosphere of 10aql , while it jumps by @xmath49 between ndand nd  in 33lib .",
    "interestingly , the bisector measurements give us just the opposite phase variation with depth if one treats the line profile as being produced in a normal stellar atmosphere where the line core is formed higher than the line wings . as we show in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ 33lib_ph - rv_all ] , the phase decreases from the wing to the core in 10aql , and increases in 33lib . at present",
    "we do not have a definite interpretation of this discrepant behaviour .",
    "one can suspect that the the broad wings of strong ree lines actually originate in the outer atmosphere and hence show pulsational characteristics of these layers .",
    "although the atmospheric parameters of 10aql and 33lib are similar , 33lib has a much stronger magnetic field , @xmath13=5.0  kg , and it has a higher overabundance of rees ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , it has a shorter main pulsation period , @xmath50  min , with the first harmonic exhibiting the highest amplitude close to the position of a radial node .",
    "the negative phase jump and the shape of the amplitude - phase diagram ( fig .",
    "[ 33lib_ph - rv_all ] , upper panel ) may be interpreted as a superposition of standing and running pulsation waves mimicing an inwardly propagating wave , as discussed by @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of chemical stratification and atmospheric structure of both stars is required for a secure interpretation of pulsation results and subsequent theoretical modelling .",
    "+      non - radial pulsations in 10aql were investigated in four different spectroscopic observing campaigns , including the present one .",
    "@xcite found that rv amplitudes in eu  and gd  lines exceed those determined for nd  line , which was not typical for a roap star .",
    "additionally , @xcite detected a change of rv amplitude between two consecutive nights of their observations .",
    "these characteristics of pulsational behaviour of 10aql are confirmed in the present more extensive analysis .",
    "@xcite observed the star during 3 nights , clearly detecting pulsational variability in 5 lines .",
    "they found the highest pulsation amplitudes of a few hundred  in the three spectral lines of @xmath51  5373 , 5471 , 5730 , which could not be identified .",
    "we also find significant amplitudes in these spectral features and tentatively identify these lines as dy , which allowed us to investigate variation of these lines in context of pulsation wave propagation through a stellar atmosphere with chemical stratification .    a recent study by @xcite presented measurements of the pulsation amplitudes and phases based on uves spectroscopic time - series over two hours , which we included in our present analysis allowing for an increase of our spectroscopic data by 10% .",
    "@xcite assumed that 10aql pulsates with a main frequency of 1.428  mhz , which is , in fact , close to one of the three main frequencies unambiguously detected in our spectroscopy and in the most photometry , but with the lowest amplitude . the second frequency detected by @xcite at 1.309  mhz",
    "is based on variations of tb  lines , and is not seen in our more voluminous data .",
    "it probably is an artifact caused by , e.g. , the limited time span of their spectroscopic observations of this multiperiodic pulsator .",
    "our study is the first to resolve the frequency spectrum of 10aql with rv measurements .",
    "we find , in agreement with precise space photometry , that pulsations of 10aql are dominated by _",
    "three _ modes of comparable amplitude . based on simulteneous spectroscopic and photometric observations",
    ", we were able to infer pulsational characteristics of individual modes as a function of height in the atmosphere of 10aql .",
    "we also obtained phase shifts between luminosity and rv variations providing constraints for modelling of roap pulsation .",
    "since our time - series analysis is based on a set of three frequencies , the rv amplitudes that we report for individual lines can not be directly compared with the results of previous studies which assumed monoperiodic variation of the star . however , a good agreement with the results by @xcite is found if we compare relative amplitudes and phase differences of the spectral features in common .",
    "the two studies obtained qualitatively similar phase - amplitude diagrams , with the exception of discordant behaviour of weak er  5903    line studied by @xcite . the pulsation characteristics of this line deviate from the generally smooth phase - amplitude behaviour of other ree ions .",
    "we omitted this line from our pulsation analysis because it is located in the spectral region full of telluric lines and is blended by 3 atmospheric lines of different intensity .",
    "this blending is the most likely the reason for the deviating behaviour of the spectral line er  5903   .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopic observations of roap stars seemed to indicate that the pulsation amplitudes of ree lines can be modulated on a time scale of a few hours .",
    "this was first noted by @xcite for @xmath0cir and later observed by @xcite for a few other roap stars . since in many cases this modulation can not be linked to known photometric pulsation frequencies , @xcite speculated that the amplitude modulation in spectroscopy suggests the discovery of a new type of pulsational behaviour in the upper atmospheres of roap stars .",
    "however , using relatively short and typically 2-hour long time series resulting in only 100150 individual measurements , this discovery is doubtful , because such short observational data sets do not allow to resolve the frequency spectrum of multiperiodic roap stars .",
    "in this context it comes not as a surprise that for the only two roap stars , hd24712 @xcite and 10aql ( this paper ) , for which an extensive spectroscopic ( and photometric ) monitoring over many nights was performed , no unexplained spectroscopic amplitude modulation could be found .",
    "all amplitude modulations in 10aql can be explained by beating effects of close frequencies .",
    "hence , we recommend extreme caution in the interpretation of amplitude changes seen in short data sets .",
