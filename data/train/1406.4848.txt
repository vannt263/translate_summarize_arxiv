    "in a strong perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 , the kinetic energy of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) is quantized into a series of discrete landau levels with a macroscopic degeneracy @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sample area and @xmath9 is the magnetic flux quantum .",

    "the layer - qhf has a u(1 ) symmetry which is associated with the invariance of the ground state energy with respect to the orientation of the layer - pseudospin in the @xmath15plane .",
    "the physics of the layer - qhf is reviewed in ref . .",
    "quantum hall ferromagnetism can be associated with many other type of degrees of freedom . in graphene , for example , the ground state of the chiral 2deg ( c2deg ) at @xmath16 and @xmath17 fillings of the landau levels @xmath18 is a valley - qhf where the two pseudospin states are now associated with the non - equivalent valleys @xmath19 and @xmath20 to a good approximation , the coulomb interaction is independent of the valley index@xcite and since there is no symmetry - breaking term associated with the valley degree of freedom , the hamiltonian has a su(2 ) symmetry in valley - pseudospin space .",

    "depending on the landau level broadening due to disorder , this discontinuity may lead to a disappearance of the quantum hall effect and to an increase in the longitudinal resistivity at the transition .",
