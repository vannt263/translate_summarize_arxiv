    "a compact foliated space @xmath4 is a compact metrisable space together with a decomposition of @xmath4 into subsets @xmath5 , called _ leaves _ , such that for each @xmath6 there is a chart @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a compact metrisable space , and the restriction of @xmath9 onto a connected component of @xmath10 is constant on the second component @xcite .",
    "one class of examples of foliated spaces arising in continuum theory are weak solenoids ; i.e. , the inverse limits @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is a closed manifold , and each bonding map @xmath13 is a finite - to - one covering map @xcite .",
    "weak solenoids are natural generalisations of the well - known one - dimensional solenoids and have the structure of a foliated bundle over a closed manifold with a cantor set fibre .",
    "leaves in solenoids are their path - connected components , and every leaf in a solenoid is dense .",
    "one - dimensional solenoids are important in the study of flows and have been identified as minimal sets of smooth flows  @xcite and are known to occur generically in hamiltonian flows on closed manifolds  @xcite .",
    "the more general solenoids introduced in  @xcite provide a class of higher - dimensional continua that have been the object of great interest in the study of continua  @xcite .",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that the equicontinuous minimal sets of foliations having the local structure of a disk in a leaf times a cantor set are solenoids , and in  @xcite examples are provided of certain classes of solenoids embedded as minimal sets of smooth foliations of manifolds .",
    "end structures of leaves provide the means to study their behaviour at infinity , and so are important for the study of the inner structure of solenoids .",
    "ghys shows in his seminal work  @xcite that the leaves of almost all ( with respect to an appropriate harmonic measure ) points of a compact foliated space have either @xmath14 , @xmath1 , @xmath0 or a cantor set of ends .",
    "the harmonic measures used are those introduced by garnett @xcite and locally have the form of the product of a harmonic function and the riemannian volume on the plaques of the leaves in foliation charts .",
    "these measures are used in foliation theory since , in contrast to invariant transverse measures , they always exist and at the same time many of the basic results from ergodic theory carry over to these harmonic measures .",
    "inspired by this result , cantwell and conlon  @xcite obtained similar results in the topological setting .",
    "they show that for a complete foliated space with a totally recurrent leaf ( in particular , for compact minimal sets ) , the leaves of all points of a residual subset either have no ends , one end , two ends or a cantor set of ends .",
    "blanc @xcite showed that if a compact minimal foliated space @xmath4 has a topologically generic leaf with @xmath0 ends , then any other leaf in @xmath4 has either @xmath1 or @xmath0 ends . in this paper",
    "we show that if a compact foliated space has a topologically generic leaf with @xmath1 end , then the maximal number of ends can be made an arbitrarily large finite number . in particular , we prove the following result .",
    "[ theor - one ] given @xmath3 , there exists a weak solenoid @xmath15 where the union of leaves with @xmath1 end forms a residual subset , the union of leaves with @xmath0 ends forms a meager subset and the number of such leaves is uncountable , and there is a single leaf with @xmath2 ends .    for each @xmath3 in theorem [ theor - one ] an example of a foliated space with required properties is obtained by a suitable modification of the schori solenoid @xcite .",
    "the schori solenoid is the inverse limit of an inverse sequence of non - regular @xmath16-to-@xmath1 coverings of a genus @xmath0 surface @xmath17 and , as any solenoid , is a foliated fibre bundle with the base @xmath17 .",
    "an important property is that every leaf @xmath18 in a foliated bundle @xmath19 is a covering space of the base , and so by the result of scott  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.2 ) the number of ends of @xmath18 is the same as the number of ends of the pair of groups @xmath20 , or the number of ends of the schreier diagram of the coset space @xmath21 .",
    "the schreier space of @xmath22 is then the set @xmath23 of all schreier diagrams of leaves , bound together in a suitable topology so that they preserve the essential dynamical properties of @xmath22 . in the case when @xmath24 is a weak solenoid , there are intermediate coverings @xmath25 which allow us to obtain a representation of @xmath23 as the inverse limit of finite graphs , and make computations by studying the projections of path components of @xmath23 onto these finite graphs .",
    "it is interesting to compare these results with the recent results  @xcite , where the number of ends of a large class of orbital schreier graphs arising in the context of self - similar group actions is determined .",
    "there , general results are obtained , showing that in a measure - theoretic sense most orbital schreier graphs have either one or two ends , and for most self - similar groups the generic end structure is one . in the case when a weak solenoid @xmath26 has a representation @xmath27 such that every covering map @xmath28 has the same degree and does not significantly differ from the other covering maps in the sequence , the image of the monodromy representation @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is a fibre of the weak solenoid , can be identified with a group of automorphisms of a regular tree .",
    "such an action is self - similar , and is generated by a finite automaton . however , the class of weak solenoids is a lot richer than those with self - similar action of the monodromy group , and our geometric approach is applicable to any of them . in section [ subsec - nonselfsimilar ]",
    "we compute end structures for a weak solenoid which is the inverse limit of a sequence of covering maps of variable degree , where a map of each degree occurs an infinite number of times . as is well - known , for solenoids of dimension @xmath1 ,",
    "i.e. inverse limits of finite coverings of @xmath31 , equivalence classes of sequences of degrees provide a classification up to a homeomorphism , and for dimension higher than @xmath1 determining whether a weak solenoid has a representation as the inverse limit of coverings of constant degree is by no means a trivial question .",
    "our geometric approach overcomes this difficulty .    the results of @xcite reveal connections of our work to the study of julia sets , and leads to interesting questions concerning the interplay between topological and measure - theoretical genericity of various properties of foliated manifolds , such as those in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in detail , our paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : sc ]",
    "we recall some background knowledge from algebraic topology and foliation theory , and give a brief outline of the computation technique of the schreier continuum .",

    "section [ sec : conclusions ] indicates some open questions .",

    ", @xmath43 is compact , @xmath4 is open in @xmath43 and @xmath41 is a totally disconnected subset of @xmath43 @xcite .",
    "recall ( see , e.g. @xcite ) that given a group @xmath46 generated by @xmath47 , the _ cayley graph _",
    "@xmath48 is the graph whose vertices are the elements of @xmath46 and for which there is an edge labelled by @xmath49 joining @xmath50 to @xmath51 if and only if @xmath52 .",

    "the _ schreier diagram _ of @xmath54 is the orbit space @xmath55 of the left action of the subgroup @xmath53 on @xmath48 .",
    "while the actual construction of this graph depends on the choice of generators @xmath56 , the number of ends of the graph is independent of this choice ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    in his classic work hopf",
    "@xcite showed that a non - compact regular covering space of a compact polyhedron has either one ( e.g. the plane ) , two ( e.g. the line ) or a cantor set of ends ( e.g. the universal cover of the figure eight ) . here",
    "a covering space @xmath57 is regular if @xmath58 is a normal subgroup of @xmath59 , and geometrically the number of ends of @xmath18 coincides with that of the cayley diagram of the quotient group @xmath60 . in the case when @xmath61 is non - regular , the generalisation of hopf s theorem to irregular coverings ( see , e.g. , scott  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 1.1 - 1.2 ) ) yields that the number of ends of @xmath18 is the same as the number of ends of the schreier diagram of the coset space @xmath60 .",
    "let @xmath22 be a compact metrisable space with foliation @xmath62 , that is @xcite , there is a decomposition of @xmath22 into disjiont subsets @xmath63 called leaves of the foliation @xmath62 , such that each @xmath64 has an open neighborhood @xmath65 with a homeomorphism @xmath66 , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 is a compact metrisable space , and connected components of @xmath69 are given by fixing values in @xmath68 .",

    "then @xmath79 is a _ foliated bundle _ ( see ,",
    "e.g. , candel and conlon ( * ? ? ?",
    "* example 2.1.5 ) ) , and , in particular , for each leaf @xmath80 the restriction @xmath81 in the leaf topology is a covering space",
    ". given @xmath82 , there is a _ total holonomy _",
    "homomorphism @xmath83 determined by the lifting of loops in @xmath76 based at @xmath84 to paths contained in the leaves of @xmath77 .",
    "this allows one to translate many questions about @xmath77 into questions involving subgroups of @xmath85 .",
    "associated to each point @xmath86 is the subgroup of @xmath87 corresponding to the stabiliser of @xmath88 for the induced action on @xmath89 , which we will refer to as the _ kernel _ of @xmath88 and denote @xmath90 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath91 is a leaf containing @xmath88 , then by standard algebraic topological arguments ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) we have @xmath92 , and the leaf @xmath91 is homeomorphic to the quotient @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the universal cover of @xmath76 .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath95 , then @xmath96 .    when the foliated bundle @xmath79 is principal ( that is , when the bundle automorphisms act transitively on the fibres of @xmath78 ) , then all the leaves of @xmath77 are regular coverings of @xmath76 and so hopf s theorem applies .",
    "moreover , in this case the bundle automorphisms yield a homeomorphism between any two leaves and so all leaves have homeomorphic end spaces , either @xmath14 ( compact ) , @xmath1 , @xmath0 or a cantor set . if @xmath79 is not principal , the kernel @xmath90 , @xmath64 , may vary depending on the point .",

    "@xmath99 is the subspace of @xmath22 formed by taking the union of all lifts of the paths @xmath100 to paths in @xmath22 starting at points of @xmath89 .",
    "it is then straightforward that @xmath101 in the leaf topology is",
    "the schreier graph of the coset space @xmath102 , and so has the same number of ends as the leaf @xmath91 .",
    "we shall refer to the sets of the form @xmath103 for a leaf @xmath18 of @xmath77 as _ leaves _ of @xmath99 and a set formed by a union of leaves will be called _ saturated _ as with foliations .",
    "a compact saturated subset of @xmath99 is _ minimal _ if it is the closure of each of its leaves .",
    "if the sequence @xmath104 converges to @xmath88 in @xmath99 , then the corresponding plaques in a foliation chart of @xmath88 converge to the plaque of @xmath88 . hence , since the leaves of @xmath99 are formed by lifting paths in @xmath76 , a set is saturated in @xmath99 if and only if the corresponding set is saturated in @xmath22 and a set in @xmath99 is minimal if and only if the corresponding set is a compact minimal subset of @xmath22 .",
    "since the leaves of @xmath99 are connected , minimal sets are compact and connected ; that is , they are continua .",
    "thus , we refer to a minimal subcontinuum @xmath105 of @xmath99 as the _ schreier continuum _ of the corresponding minimal set of @xmath22 .",
    "if the foliation of the bundle @xmath79 is minimal , the notions of the schreier space and the schreier continuum are interchangeable .",
    "in this section we prove theorem [ theor - one ] , that is , for any @xmath106 we construct a compact foliated space @xmath15 such that the union of leaves with @xmath1 end is a residual subset of @xmath15 , the union of leaves with @xmath0 ends forms a meager subset of @xmath15 and the number of such leaves is uncountable , and there is a single leaf with @xmath2 ends .",
    "we are going to construct these examples as inverse limits of sequences of finite coverings of a genus @xmath0 surface , i.e. _ weak solenoids_. for convenience we recall basic facts about solenoids in section [ subsec - weaksolenoids ] , where we also give some algebraic examples of computations of end structures .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theor - one ] is obtained on the basis of the schori solenoid @xcite , an example where a direct algebraic technique is not sufficient .",
    "the proof of theorem [ theor - one ] for @xmath107 is detailed in section [ sec : schoriexample ] . in section [ subsec : generalisedschori ]",
    "we show how to modify schori s solenoid in such a way that the exceptional leaf has any given even number of ends . in section [ subsec : rtsolenoid ]",
    "we describe the schreier continuum for the rogers - tollefson example ( see also example [ example : rt ] ) . in section [ subsec - nonselfsimilar ]",
    "we give an example of a solenoid , based on the schori construction , where the group of automorphisms of the fibre acts non self - similarly .",
    "a general class of examples of foliated bundles with a cantor set fibre can be found in weak solenoids . here",
    ", a solenoid @xmath108 will refer to the inverse limit @xmath109 of an inverse sequence of closed manifolds @xmath110 where each bonding map @xmath111 is a covering map of index greater than one .",
    "the projection @xmath112 is a fibre bundle projection with a profinite structure group and cantor set fibre ( see fokkink and oversteegen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 33 ) ) .",
    "when a solenoid is homogeneous ( i.e. , when the homeomorphism group acts transitively on the solenoid ) , the solenoid can be represented as the inverse limit of an inverse sequence where each covering map @xmath113 is regular  @xcite , and in this case the associated bundle is principal ( see mccord ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.6 ) ) .",
    "thus , a solenoid can be considered a natural generalisation of covering spaces of closed manifolds where the fibre is no longer discrete but instead totally disconnected , and where regular covering spaces correspond to homogeneous solenoids .",
    "locally , a solenoid is homeomorphic to @xmath114 , where @xmath115 is a euclidean disk of the same the dimension as the base manifold @xmath17 .",
    "denote by @xmath116 the image of the homomorphism @xmath117 then the kernel at @xmath118 , as defined in the previous section , is given by @xmath119    thus , the schreier continuum associated to @xmath26 and some fixed finite set of generators @xmath56 of @xmath120 is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the schreier diagram for the coset space @xmath123 .",
    "alternatively , consider @xmath124 to be the image of the schreier space @xmath125 under the covering projection @xmath126 , and each @xmath127 as the lift of @xmath124 to @xmath110 by the covering map @xmath128",
    ".    [ example : dyadics ]    in the case that the solenoid is a principal bundle and all path - connected components are homeomorphic , the end structure can typically be found directly by analysing the kernels @xmath129 at points @xmath86 , and all possible end structures do occur .",
    "for example , let @xmath130 and each @xmath131 be a @xmath0-fold covering map . the inverse limit @xmath132",
    "is usually called the dyadic solenoid .",
    "the universal cover of each leaf is @xmath133 and for each @xmath134 the kernel @xmath129 is trivial .",
    "therefore , each leaf in @xmath135 is homeomorphic to @xmath133 and so has @xmath0 ends .",
    "the dyadic solenoid has a self - similarity structure and its ends could be treated in the context of self - similar group actions as in @xcite ; however , if the bonding maps @xmath131 are distinct primes and the resulting solenoid has no self - similarity , the results of @xcite do not apply but this solenoid can be treated by our technique in the same way as the dyadic solenoid .    generalising this example to @xmath0 dimensions one obtains a solenoid @xmath136 which fibres over a @xmath0-torus @xmath137 .",
    "the universal cover of each leaf is @xmath138 , and for each @xmath139 the kernel @xmath129 is trivial and so each leaf has @xmath1 end .",
    "it is known that a free group on @xmath0 generators @xmath140 can be realised as the fundamental group of a @xmath16-manifold , and @xmath140 is geometrically residually finite ( see scott  @xcite for general results about residually finite groups ) .",
    "thus , choosing an appropriate decreasing chain of subgroups @xmath141 of finite index with @xmath142 with each @xmath141 normal in @xmath140 , one can construct a solenoid in which each leaf has a cantor set of ends .",
    "[ example : rt ] more interesting examples of ends occur when the solenoid does not have the structure of the principal bundle and the structure of the set of ends vary from leaf to leaf .",
    "one such example is given by rogers and tollefson @xcite .",
    "their solenoid is the inverse limit of @xmath0-fold coverings of the klein bottle @xmath143 by itself @xmath144 the solenoid @xmath145 is double covered by the solenoid @xmath146 with non - trivial covering transformation of the covering map @xmath147 represented by the involution @xmath148 , where @xmath149 is the rotation in the circle by @xmath150 and @xmath151 is the map induced by the reflections @xmath152 .",
    "the involution @xmath153 has a unique fixed point @xmath88 , so it fixes a single path - connected component of @xmath154 and is a homeomorphism when restricted to any other path - connected component .",
    "thus every path - component in @xmath145 other than the exceptional one is homeomorphic to @xmath155 and has @xmath0 ends .",
    "the exceptional path - component is homeomorphic to the quotient space @xmath156 it is non - orientable and has @xmath1 end .",
    "the schori example is the solenoid @xmath157 where @xmath17 is a genus @xmath0 surface , and for every @xmath158 the bonding map @xmath159 is a @xmath16-to-@xmath1 non - regular covering projection .",
