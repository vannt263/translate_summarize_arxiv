    "low - temperature heat transport is an important physical property of solids and is useful for probing many kinds of elementary excitations , such as phonons , electrons , magnons and spinons , etc .",
    "thermal conductivity ( @xmath0 ) is strongly dependent on the statistical laws of these excitations and their transport properties , which are directly related to the nature of the ground states of materials .",
    "for example , the temperature dependence of very - low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity can directly show the purely phononic transport , the pairing symmetries of superconductors , the fermi - liquid state of metals and the nature of spin liquid in quantum magnets.@xcite when the scattering between different types of quasiparticles is significant , the low-@xmath7 heat transport can also be an effective way to detect such couplings ; in particular , the spin - phonon or magnon - phonon couplings in insulating magnetic materials are sometimes easily revealed by the measurement of the magnetic - field dependence of thermal conductivity.@xcite in cases of magnetic excitations either transporting heat or strongly scattering phonons , the magnetic phase transitions , including the changes of either the ground state or the spin structure , can be sensitively probed by the thermal conductivity measurements.@xcite the purpose of this work is to get more information on the magnetic phase transitions and spin - phonon coupling of multiferroic materials by studying the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity .",

    "the magnetic - field dependences of electric polarization ( @xmath22 ) were carefully studied and discussed to be related to the transitions of magnetic structures . in the case of @xmath23 ,",
    "the simultaneous spin - flop transition of gd@xmath10 moments and reorientation of fe@xmath10 spins occur at @xmath6 0.5 t.@xcite across this transition , the magnetic structure changes from phase i ( @xmath15 for fe@xmath10 spins and @xmath24 for gd@xmath10 moments ) to phase ii ( fe@xmath10 : @xmath25 ; gd@xmath10 : @xmath26 ) ; thus , the electric polarization originating from the spin exchange striction shows a sudden drop . upon increasing the magnetic field further , gd@xmath10 spins gradually turn to the direction of magnetic field and they are completely polarized at @xmath6 2 t , where the magnetic structure changes from phase ii to phase iii ( fe@xmath10 : @xmath25 ; gd@xmath10 : @xmath27 ) . in the case of @xmath4 , the magnetic structure changes from phase",

    "one peculiarity of the heat transport of gdfeo@xmath1 is that it shows a hysteresis of the subkelvin @xmath5 curves in a broad range of magnetic field . the possible origin of this irreversibility",

    "as far as the zero - field data are concerned , they show a typical phonon transport behavior at relatively high temperatures .",
    "@xcite in particular , the magnitude of the phonon peak at 18 k is as large as 250 w / km , which is rather rare in the transition - metal oxides and indicates weak crystal defects or impurities . at low temperatures ,",
    "however , there are some features showing a complexity of the phonon transport in this materials .",
    "first , even at very low temperatures the @xmath54 data show a distinct deviation from the @xmath50 law , a sign of the phonon boundary - scattering limit , which apparently indicates the remaining of significant microscopic scattering of phonons.@xcite actually , the zero - field curve exhibits a weak kink - like temperature dependence below 2 k , which is likely due to the magnon - phonon scattering since the gd@xmath10 moments order antiferromagnetically below 2.2 k.@xcite the effect of magnetic field on thermal conductivity seems to confirm this possibility .",
    "when 14 t magnetic field is applied , the conductivities below 2 k become larger and the kink disappears , which clearly indicates the negative effect of magnons on the heat transport , considering that at low temperatures the magnons can hardly be thermally excited in high field .",
    "a @xmath51 dependence , which is very close to the boundary scattering limit , indicates that magnetic scattering on phonons is almost smeared out in 14 t field .",
    "in addition , the effect of strong magnetic field on @xmath30 is essentially isotropic for @xmath55 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is possible to estimate the mean free path of phonons at low temperatures and to judge whether the phonons are free from microscopic scattering at subkelvin temperatures .",
    "the phononic thermal conductivity can be expressed by the kinetic formula @xmath56,@xcite where @xmath57 is phonon specific heat at low temperatures , @xmath58 is the average velocity and @xmath52 is the mean free path of phonon . here",
    "@xmath43 j / k@xmath32mol is obtained from the above specific - heat data and @xmath58 = 1930 m / s can be estimated from deybe temperature @xmath59 using the relations @xmath60 and @xmath61,@xcite where @xmath62 is the number of molecules per mole and each molecule comprises @xmath63 atoms , @xmath64 is the volume of crystal and @xmath65 the universal gas constant .",

    "2 , the ratio @xmath69 increases with lowering temperature and becomes close to one at 0.3 k , which means that the boundary scattering limit is nearly established at such low temperatures . on the other hand , although not shown in the figure , the mean free path of phonons in zero field is apparently several times smaller than that in 14 t field , which obviously demonstrates the significance of microscopic phonon scattering in zero field .    -axis thermal conductivity of gdfeo@xmath1 single crystal .",

    ", @xmath30 achieves a saturated value in high magnetic fields , but the magnitude weakens gradually with increasing temperature .",
    "note that the high - field enhancement of thermal conductivity can be as high as @xmath6 700% , while the strongest suppression at low fields is @xmath6 50% , which clearly indicates that the coupling between magnons and phonons is pretty strong.@xcite another remarkable feature is that at subkelvin temperatures there are two  dips \" at low fields ( @xmath72 4 t ) for @xmath3 , while only one shallow and broad  dip \" emerges for @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the field - induced suppression of conductivity becomes weaker as increasing temperature . at higher temperatures above 1 k ,",

    "however , this is not the whole story .",
    "it is found that the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity of gdfeo@xmath1 is dependent on the history of applying magnetic field .    as shown in fig .",
    "4 , for both @xmath55 and @xmath4 , the @xmath71 isotherms measured with field increasing are larger than those with field decreasing , forming a clear hysteresis at low temperatures .",
    "this phenomenon demonstrates that at very low temperatures , there is some peculiar channel of phonon scattering that is related not only to the magnetic field but also to the history of applying field . as discussed on figs . 2 and 3 , the magnons are effective phonon scatterers in zero and low fields .",
    "however , they can not simply produce an irreversible behavior of @xmath5 in such a broad field range from almost zero to @xmath6 3 t. in particular , the spin polarization is a naturally continuous transition and the hysteretic behavior can not be expected across this transition . on the other hand , other microscopic phonon scatterers like point defects or dislocations in crystal structure are also irrelevant for two reasons.@xcite first , the scattering processes from crystal imperfections have nothing to do with the external magnetic field , let alone the history of applying field ; second , these scatterings are known to be less effective upon lowering temperature , but the hysteresis becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature .",
    "then , what else can be the origin of this kind of scattering that produces the hysteresis ? considering the development of hysteresis upon lowering temperature , a natural origin is related to the magnetic or ferroelectric domains in this multiferroic material , in which the domain walls can play an important role in scattering phonons at very low temperatures when the mean free path of phonons is long enough to be comparable to the interval of domain walls .",
    "it is known from the former work that the weak - ferromagnetism - related domains in gdfeo@xmath1 can be produced only at very low field ( @xmath72 0.1 t).@xcite therefore , the ferroelectric domain walls are likely the main source of phonon scattering that is responsible for the @xmath5 irreversibility in the broad field range well above 0.1 t. in this regard , there are several experimental results supporting the origin of @xmath5 hysteresis from the ferroelectric domains . first , the electric polarization vs magnetic field @xmath75 also showed the irreversible behaviors in the absence of electric field for both @xmath55 and @xmath70.@xcite second , the field range that the hysteretic behavior of @xmath5 appears is almost the same as that exhibiting the hysteretic @xmath75 curves.@xcite third , the relative magnitude of polarization for field increasing and field decreasing indicated that there are less ferroelectric domains when the field is increasing.@xcite it is therefore in good agreement with the present observation that the thermal conductivity is larger in the field - increasing branch , which can be due to the weaker phonon scattering by domain walls . furthermore , with increasing temperature the size of hysteresis diminishes and disappears completely above @xmath6 1 k , also in good agreement with the fact that the phonon scattering by boundaries are unimportant at high temperatures where the mean free path of phonons becomes much shorter than the averaged distance of domain walls .",
    "-axis thermal conductivity of gdfeo@xmath1 single crystal in 2 t magnetic field along the @xmath11 axis ( a ) and in 2.5 t field along the @xmath13 axis ( b ) .",
    "the data are taken with slowly warming up the sample from the lowest temperature after field cooling or zero - field cooling.,width=321 ]    the magnetic - field - induced irreversibility of @xmath0 can also be manifested in the @xmath66 curves , as shown in fig .",
    "5 , measured in some characteristic fields by warming up the sample after zero - field cooling or field cooling to the lowest temperature .",
    "it is found that below 1 k the zero - field cooled ( zfc ) conductivities are larger than the field cooled ( fc ) ones , which coincides with the hysteresis of @xmath5 curves .",
    "this difference indicates that there are less ferroelectric domains if the sample is cooled in zero field . from these data",
    ", one can get a rough estimation of the averaged distance between the ferroelectric domain walls , which usually has the same order of magnitude to that of the mean free path of phonons as long as the domain walls are effective phonon scatterers . following the above calculation on the 14 t @xmath66 data , the mean free path of phonons",
    "is obtained to be 2030 @xmath76 m from the zfc data in fig .",
    "this is a rather reasonable value of domain size for the ferroelectric single crystals .",
    "note that the hysteresis of @xmath5 of a magnetic material itself is not strange .",
    "the irreversibility has been known to often appear at the field - induced first - order magnetic transition , such as the spin - peierls to af order@xcite and the liquid - gas - like transition in spin - ice compounds,@xcite etc . however , the hysteretic @xmath5 of gdfeo@xmath1 is somewhat different , because it appears in a rather broad field range where the magnetization does not show irreversibility.@xcite in contrast , another well - known large hysteresis of low-@xmath7 @xmath5 is the one observed in the high-@xmath77 cuprate bi@xmath78sr@xmath78cacu@xmath78o@xmath79 ( bscco),@xcite in which the hysteresis is well understood by the vortex - pinning effect that is accompanied with the irreversible macroscopic magnetization . from the above discussions ,",
    "one can see that the irreversible @xmath5 of gdfeo@xmath1 is most likely caused by the ferroelectric domain walls scattering on phonons , that is dependent on the history of applying the magnetic field .",

    "regard , changing the domain structures by applying magnetic field is free from such problem and can give more reliable data .",
    "it is intriguing that in multiferroic gdfeo@xmath1 the ferroelectric domain structures are able to be manipulated by the magnetic field , which is a key to make the peculiar low-@xmath7 @xmath5 hysteresis to be observable .",
    "the low - temperature heat transport of gdfeo@xmath1 single crystal is found to be strongly dependent on the magnetic field and is helpful for studying the magnetic transitions and magnetoelectric coupling in this material .",
    "the magnons play an important role in the low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity by scattering phonons instead of acting as heat carriers . as a result ,",
    "both the spin - flop or reorientation of the magnetic structure and spin polarization cause significant phonon scattering at the transition fields .",
    "the most remarkable result is that the low-@xmath7 ( @xmath72 1 k ) thermal conductivity shows an irreversible behavior on the history of applying magnetic field .",
    "this phenomenon is rather peculiar in the sense that it appears in a broad range of magnetic field ( @xmath6 03 t ) where the magnetization is known to be almost reversible .",
    "furthermore , the hysteresis of @xmath5 or the irreversibility of zfc and fc @xmath66 become larger upon lowering temperatures .",
    "all these data suggest that the ferroelectric domain structures , which are surprisingly sensitive to the history of applying magnetic field , are playing the key role in producing the irreversibility of thermal conductivity through the phonon scattering by the domain walls .",
    "the present results show an interesting case that the ferroelectric domains of a multiferroic material can be manipulated by magnetic field , and this kind of magnetoelectric coupling can be observed by the heat transport measurement at very low temperatures .",

    "they also show similar behaviors to those of the zfc and fc @xmath54 data .    in summary ,",
    "the low-@xmath7 heat transport of gdfeo@xmath1 is nearly isotropic .",
    "there are strong coupling between the phonons and magnons , which determines the main features of the magnetic - field dependence of thermal conductivity .",
    "the characteristic transitions of @xmath5 isotherms are strongly dependent on the direction of external field and are caused by the field - induced transitions of magnetic structure .",
    "an irreversibility of low-@xmath7 thermal conductivity on the magnetic field is observed and is likely due to the phonon scattering by the ferroelectric domain walls .",
    "the peculiarity is that this phenomenon points to the manipulation of ferroelectric properties by magnetic field , which is a characteristic of multiferroic materials ."
