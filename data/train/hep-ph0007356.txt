    "the strong coupling approximation has played an important role in the development of qcd lattice gauge theory from its very inception . in the renowned paper by wilson @xcite this approximation",
    "was invoked to demonstrate quark confinement on the euclidean space  time lattice . soon thereafter",
    "kogut and susskind @xcite formulated the hamiltonian lattice gauge theory and concluded that in the strong coupling limit the quark dynamics is best described by a collection of non  abelian electric flux tubes with quarks attached at their ends .",

    "finally , calculations by kogut , pearson and shigemitsu @xcite and by creutz @xcite suggesting the absence of a phase transition between the strong and weak coupling regimes of qcd motivated numerous studies in this subject which continues to date .    the hamiltonian formulation of strong coupling qcd using wilson fermions was first studied in detail by smit @xcite who derived an effective hamiltonian using the @xmath2 approximation and applied the spin wave theory of magnetism to determine the vacuum energy density and the excitation spectrum . in the absence of the current quark mass and the wilson term",

    "introduction of the wilson term explicitly breaks the latter symmetry further down to @xmath6 solving the fermion doubling problem .",

    "valatin variational method to the same effective hamiltonian and found that the vacuum is not chirally degenerate and concluded that the massless pseudoscalar boson found by smit is not a goldstone boson .    in this letter we report on a new approach to study strongly coupled hamiltonian lattice qcd using wilson fermions .",
    "our approach differs from those adopted in @xcite and @xcite in that we explictly construct a solution to the field equations of motion derived from the hamiltonian .",
    "this solution exactly diagonalizes the hamiltonian to second order in field operators and obeys the free lattice dirac equation where the mass plays the role of the gap . using the equation of motion we derive the gap equation for the dynamical quark mass to @xmath1 .",
    "our results for the dynamical quark mass is qualitatively different from the one found in @xcite .    with our solution",
    "the interpretation of the chiral condensate being the order parameter becomes transparent as well as the observation that the broken symmetry phase is the energetically favored phase .",
