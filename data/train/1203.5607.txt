    "quantum decoherence presents a fundamental limitation to the realization of practical quantum computing and of other technological devices which actively exploit quantum phenomena . in 2002 , a ground - breaking study established the usefulness of so - called optimal working points ( owps):@xcite these are parameter regimes where the system becomes - to first order - insensitive to fluctuations of external classical fields .",
    "we consider here the effect of owps in a system where decoherence of a central spin system arises from interactions with a fluctuating bath of surrounding spins - a scenario that is of considerable significance in the field of quantum information .",
    "@xcite    a promising approach for silicon - based quantum - information processing ( qip ) involves combined electron and nuclear spins of donor atoms in si , which are amenable to high - fidelity manipulation by means of electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) and nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , respectively .",
    "most studies have considered phosphorus ( @xmath2 ) donors in si .",
    "@xcite more recently , several different groups have investigated another group v donor , @xmath3 .",
    "these studies not only showed that bismuth donors have similar properties to si : p , such as long electron spin coherence times @xmath4 of the order of several ms at low temperatures ( @xmath1  k),@xcite but that they also offer new possibilities for qip .",
    "for example , strong optical hyperpolarization was demonstrated,@xcite allowing for efficient initialization of the nuclear spin .",
    "the si : bi spin system has an electron spin @xmath5 and a large nuclear spin @xmath6 as well as an atypically strong hyperfine coupling constant , @xmath7  ghz .",
    "the strong state - mixing occurring for magnetic fields",
    "@xmath8  t where the hyperfine interaction competes with the electronic zeeman energy allows transitions which are forbidden at high magnetic fields,@xcite observed recently in ref .  .",
    "in refs .  , a set of minima and maxima were found in the @xmath9 parameter space of dipole - allowed transitions at frequencies @xmath10 .",
    "these @xmath11 points were identified as owps : line narrowing and reduced sensitivity to temporal and spatial noise in @xmath12 over a broad region of fields ( closely related to @xmath13 extrema ) were found .",
    "however , to date , their effectiveness for reducing decoherence in the real environment of a spin bath remains untested .    in natural si , 4.67% of lattice sites are occupied by the nuclear spin - half @xmath0 isotope , rather than the spinless @xmath14 .",
    "flip - flopping of the @xmath0 spins provides the dominant mechanism of decoherence for both si : p and si : bi systems at low temperatures .",
    "the decay of the donor hahn spin echo for these systems is typically fitted to @xmath15 $ ] , where @xmath16  ms characterizes the nuclear spin diffusion , with @xmath17.@xcite other relaxation processes , such as those arising from donor - donor interactions , are represented by @xmath4 .",
    "since @xmath18 , nuclear spin diffusion remains the main channel of decoherence at low temperatures.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the nature of the bi-@xmath0 interaction by means of pulsed electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor).@xcite to obtain an endor spectrum , an epr spin echo is detected as a function of a radio frequency ( rf ) excitation .",
    "when the rf radiation is resonant with an nmr transition , changes are seen in the epr signal if the populations of the relevant energy levels change .",
    "previous endor studies of si : bi used rf frequencies of at least several hundreds of mhz,@xcite and thus could not probe the weak couplings to a spin - bath .",
    "in contrast , here , rf frequencies of a few mhz were used . with this approach",
    ", we have measured the bismuth spin bath superhyperfine ( shf ) couplings and determined their anisotropy .",
    "we also present the results of cluster correlation expansion ( cce ) simulations .",
    "@xcite this model has been used with considerable success to model central spin decoherence in si : p.@xcite in ref .  , weak state - mixing in si : bi was investigated by simply allowing for the variation of an effective gyromagnetic ratio . here",
    "we adapt the cce simulations to include , for the first time , the strong state - mixing seen near the owps . a key finding is the demonstration of near - complete suppression of nuclear spin diffusion , even in natural si : this occurs in extremely narrow regions , where @xmath19 is in effect divergent,@xcite in contrast to the broader effect expected from the form of @xmath20.@xcite a successful means of controlling decoherence is to employ isotopically enriched",
    "samples,@xcite which can exhibit long @xmath4 times up to the order of seconds.@xcite thus , the owps represent a potentially complementary technique , effective for both natural si and partially enriched samples .",
    "in addition , our work suggests that the owps may also be effective in suppressing residual effects such as donor - donor interactions which are responsible for shortening @xmath4 times from seconds to the ms timescale.@xcite",
    "we investigate a spin system with total hamiltonian @xmath21 the first term denotes the isotropic hyperfine interaction between the bismuth electronic and nuclear spins . for si : bi , the usual high - field reduction to ising form @xmath22 can not be made at the fields of interest here .",
    "the second term represents the zeeman interaction with the external field , including the donor spins and summed over bath spins , @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the electronic zeeman frequency ( @xmath25  jt@xmath26 ) while @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the ratios of the nuclear to electronic zeeman frequencies for the donor and @xmath0 spins , respectively .",
    "the spin - bath interaction term @xmath29 represents the shf couplings between the donor and bath spins , in general of tensor form ( for anisotropic couplings ) .",
    "finally , dipolar coupling between each pair of @xmath0 spins is represented by the bath term @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the relative position vector of bath spins at lattice sites @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "writing @xmath34 for a pair of spins , the components of the dipolar tensor @xmath35 are given by @xmath36 with @xmath37  na@xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the experimental endor studies reported here served to investigate and characterize the isotropic / anisotropic character of the spin - bath interaction term , namely a set of distinct @xmath40 values - shf couplings - in eq .",
    "( [ eq : interactionh ] ) , corresponding to occupancy of inequivalent lattice sites by @xmath0 impurities .",
    "pulsed endor experiments were performed using the davies endor pulse sequence.@xcite we applied the pulse sequence @xmath41 , where the microwave ( mw ) frequency is chosen to excite one epr transition and the rf is stochastically varied between @xmath42  mhz or @xmath43  mhz to excite all nuclear spin transitions in this region .",
    "we used @xmath44  ns long @xmath45-pulses and a @xmath46  ns long @xmath47-pulse . for optimal signal - to - noise ratio and resolution , we used a @xmath48-pulse of @xmath49 .",
    "pulse delays were set to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and a shot repetition time of 1.3  ms was employed to give a good signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "all experiments were carried out at 15  k on an e580 pulsed epr spectrometer ( bruker biospin ) equipped with pulsed endor accessory ( e560d - p ) , a dielectric ring endor resonator ( en4118x - md4 ) , a liquid helium flow cryostat ( oxford cf935 ) , and an rf amplifier ( eni a-500w ) .",
    "we used a donor concentration of @xmath53  @xmath54 and the magnetic field was directed perpendicular to the [ 111 ] plane .",
    "while not offering the higher frequency resolution attainable with continuous - wave endor,@xcite the pulsed endor measurements permit us to adequately constrain and to demonstrate the reliability of the numerical simulations .",
    "in particular , we established that isotropic couplings to the spin bath dominate the decoherence dynamics . while not the focus of this study , a further motivation is to investigate the feasibility of an alternative possibility for qip : to simultaneously manipulate the @xmath0 atoms as spin - half qubits , along with the donors.@xcite    measured endor spectra at @xmath55  ghz are presented in fig .

    "[ fig : endor ] , there is significant mixing of the high - field si : bi energy eigenstates @xmath57 .",

    "the minima correspond to transitions between states corresponding to adjacent avoided level crossings , of which there are four .",
    "the disparity between the electronic zeeman and hyperfine energy scales and shf energy scales means that the tensor coupling in eq .",

    "nonsecular terms involving @xmath70 and @xmath71 can be neglected.@xcite diagonalization of the resulting 2-dimensional hamiltonian , and setting @xmath72 for a purely isotropic coupling leads to a simple expression for the endor resonance frequency for donor level @xmath73 : @xmath74 the above expression is in perfect agreement with full numerical diagonalization . the couplings in fig .",

    "the same expression and a single set of couplings gave excellent agreement with data at 10 different fields .",
    "in particular , the observed pattern of half a dozen highest frequency @xmath0 resonances moving to a minimum at @xmath75  t , then increasing again , is directly attributable to mixing of the states of the bismuth donor : i.e. , here @xmath76 has a minimum .",
    "ten out of the twelve couplings extracted from data were found to be purely isotropic .",

    "<S> we present pulsed electron - nuclear double resonance ( endor ) experiments which enable us to characterize the coupling between bismuth donor spin qubits in si and the surrounding spin bath of @xmath0 impurities which provides the dominant decoherence mechanism ( nuclear spin diffusion ) at low temperatures ( @xmath1  k ) . </S>",
    "<S> decoupling from the spin bath is predicted and cluster correlation expansion simulations show near - complete suppression of spin diffusion , at optimal working points . </S>",
    "<S> the suppression takes the form of sharply peaked divergences of the spin diffusion coherence time , in contrast with previously identified broader regions of insensitivity to classical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> endor data suggest that anisotropic contributions are comparatively weak , so the form of the divergences is largely independent of crystal orientation . </S>"
