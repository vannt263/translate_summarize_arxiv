    "in a complete financial market , the absence of arbitrage opportunities leads to the definition of a unique fair price for any contingent claim using replication arguments .",
    "this uniqueness property disappears as soon as constraints are introduced in the replication procedure , see e.g@xmath1 @xcite and references therein .",
    "this implies the existence of a closed interval of arbitrage - free prices .",
    "a commonly considered prudential pricing methodology consists in selecting the upper bound of this interval .",
    "this so - called super - replication price coincides with the minimal initial amount of money required to constitute an admissible portfolio strategy satisfying the constraints and whose terminal value dominates the claim of interest .",
    "the super - replication price under convex delta constraints has been thoroughly studied in the literature . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors obtain a dual representation of the super - replication price in terms of a well chosen set of risk neutral probabilities . in @xcite ,",
    "closely related to the previous work , the super - replication price process is shown to be the unique solution of a backward stochastic differential equation ( bsde ) with constraints on the gain process @xmath2 .",
    "all these works mainly rely on probabilistic and duality arguments . in a markovian",
    "setting , the super - replication price is characterised using direct dynamic programming arguments and pde techniques , see @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors observe that , for the classical black scholes model , the super - replication price of a claim under convex delta constraints coincides with the unconstrained replication price of a so - called facelift transform of this claim .",
    "they consider constraints in terms of number of shares in dimension 1 , wealth proportion or money amount in any dimension , and exhibit the three corresponding facelifting procedures . in more general markovian models ,",
    "the super - replication price function under convex portfolio constraints of a non path - dependent claim interprets as the smallest function above the unconstrained price of the claim , which is stable under the corresponding facelift transform , see e.g@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the goal of this paper is to state a necessary and sufficient condition under which the noteworthy result of @xcite extends to general local volatility models in dimension @xmath3 .    to exhibit this condition presented in theorem [ maintheorem ] below ,",
    "we rely on a bsde representation of the replicating strategy .",
    "we show in proposition [ pr representation ] that the replicating strategy is the unique solution of a multidimensional linear bsde with terminal value @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a smooth payoff function and @xmath6 denotes the assets price process .",
    "+ if @xmath5 satisfies the portfolio constraint , i.e. @xmath7 is valued in some convex set @xmath8 , the condition given in theorem [ maintheorem ] ensures that the solution of a multi - dimensional linear bsde with terminal value @xmath4 is valued in a convex set @xmath8 .",
    "namely , the super - replication price of the claim with payoff @xmath9 under convex delta constraints coincides with its unconstrained replication price .",
    "it is crucial to observe that we can not rely on classical viability results for bsdes @xcite since the class of possible terminal value for the bsde is restricted here to gradient type terminal conditions of the form @xmath4 .",
    "the condition obtained in @xcite is thus only a sufficient condition for our problem .",
    "contrary to this paper , we take advantage here of the linear structure of the problem .",
    "it appears that the study of the viability condition for the convex set @xmath8 boils down to the study of the viability condition for the tangent half - spaces to @xmath8 .",

    "our approach allows us also to remark that , under the exhibited condition of interest , the super - replication price of an american option with exercise payoff @xmath10 under convex delta constraints also coincides with its unconstrained replication price .",
    "+ in practice , the payoff function @xmath5 does not satisfy that @xmath7 is valued in @xmath8 nor any smoothness property .",
    "nevertheless , our main result still holds using the facelift transform of @xmath5 .",
    "the proofs in the general case are based on regularisation techniques .",
    "we also discuss in this paper various practical cases which are of interest in finance , see section 3 .",
    "we first observe that the result of @xcite in the black scholes model does not extend to the consideration of a financial market with @xmath11 assets .",
    "the hypercubes are the only convex set of constraints for which facelifting the payoff allows to get rid of the portfolio constraints in a multidimensional black scholes model .",
    "this property extends also to most of the common local volatility models , in which each asset follows its own dynamics . in particular ,",
    "hypercubes include the consideration of non - tradable assets or no short sell restrictions .",
    "more specifically , we observe that the only model dynamics in which no short sell restrictions on asset @xmath0 can be relaxed using a facelifting procedure are the one for which the quadratic covariations between the other assets do not depend on asset @xmath0 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sectionproblem ] , we specify the problem formulation and exhibit the main properties of the super - replication methodology and related facelift operator . in section [ sectionmain ] , we produce the main result of the paper which gives a tractable analytical necessary and sufficient condition , ensuring that the exact replication property holds for a large class of payoff functions .",
