    "the assumptions ( [ assumpi ] ) , ( [ assumpii ] ) are not satisfied by some of the models which are popular in financial practice .",
    "one important model of this type is the constant elasticity of variance ( cev ) model @xcite , which is defined by the diffusion @xmath11 this model is used for modeling the skew in equities and fx markets , and allows the flexibility of calibrating to the atm slope of the implied volatility by choosing appropriately the exponent @xmath12 . for @xmath13 ,",
