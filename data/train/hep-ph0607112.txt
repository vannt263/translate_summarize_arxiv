    "many physicists consider neutrino oscillations to be the first clear signature for physics beyond the standard model . with the most recent data from sno and super - kamiokande ,",
    "there remains virtually no doubt about the existence of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "indeed , the parameter space for neutrino mass differences and mixing angles has already become significantly constrained",
    ".    there remains , however , the paramount issue concerning how these experimentally determined parameters can be accommodated within a theoretically motivated model .",
    "while there have been numerous avenues that have been explored within recent years , models with large extra dimensions have received considerable attention ever since it was realized  @xcite that extra spacetime dimensions have the potential to provide new , intrinsically geometric perspectives on the hierarchies between various energy scales present within and beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "these include the planck scale  @xcite , the gut scale  @xcite , and the string scale  @xcite , as well as a possible scale for susy - breaking  @xcite .",
    "neutrino phenomenology has also been investigated within this higher - dimensional context , with the fundamental idea  @xcite being that since the right - handed neutrino is a standard - model singlet , it need not necessarily be bound to the brane to which the other standard - model particles are restricted .",
    "the right - handed neutrino can therefore propagate into the bulk of extra spacetime dimensions and accrue an infinite tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations , all of which will then take part in neutrino oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this idea , along with numerous variations , has spawned a relatively large literature investigating various aspects of higher - dimensional neutrino phenomenology ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the challenge for these bulk - neutrino models , however , is to accommodate a suitable flavor structure which can trigger the observed neutrino oscillations . to date",
    ", two different directions have been explored in the literature .",
    "one direction involves generalizing the original idea of refs .",
    "@xcite by introducing a separate right - handed bulk neutrino for each flavor of neutrino on the brane .",
    "this process thereby extends flavor into the bulk .",
    "however , in such cases , the brane / bulk couplings become arbitrary @xmath0 mixing matrices whose parameters are in principle undetermined . moreover , the three bulk neutrinos can in principle correspond to different extra spacetime dimensions with different radii .",
    "thus , one obtains a scenario with many undetermined parameters governing neutrino masses and mixing angles .",
    "indeed , to a large extent , the role of the extra dimensions in such scenarios is reduced to providing a set of kaluza - klein states which function ( from a four - dimensional perspective ) as additional sterile neutrinos .",
    "in contrast , flavor neutrino oscillations continue to be triggered through mixing angles which are ultimately introduced by hand , just as in four dimensions .",
    "this therefore fails to yield any further insight regarding the structure or origins of the neutrino mixings .    a second ,",
    "more `` minimal '' idea first advanced in ref .",
    "@xcite is to introduce only one bulk neutrino , and to provide this single bulk neutrino with flavor - universal couplings to all three brane neutrinos .",
    "thus , in so doing , one is essentially considering flavor to be a feature internal to the standard model , a feature which is restricted to the brane and which therefore does not extend into the bulk .",
    "it is even possible to take the brane theory to be flavor - diagonal , thereby avoiding mixing angles completely ; indeed , in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , the only flavor - sensitive feature that distinguishes these brane neutrinos is their differing bare majorana masses @xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless , one finds  @xcite that sizable neutrino flavor oscillations between the different neutrinos on the brane arise as a result of their indirect mixings with the kaluza - klein modes of the bulk right - handed neutrino .",
    "thus , in such a model , the flavor oscillations are entirely `` bulk - mediated '' and no mixing angles are needed at all : it is the presence of the higher - dimensional bulk which is completely responsible for inducing the flavor oscillations on the brane .",
    "although it is possible to consider cases in which the couplings between the brane neutrinos and the bulk neutrino are large , it is convenient ( and perhaps also phenomenologically necessary ) to consider a so - called `` perturbative '' limit in which these couplings are relatively small . in such cases ,",
    "it is possible to integrate out the effects of the kaluza - klein bulk neutrinos in order to obtain an effective mixing matrix involving only the light modes in the theory . typically , these light modes consist of the three brane neutrinos as well as the zero mode(s ) of the bulk neutrino(s ) .",
    "because this effective mixing matrix completely encapsulates the resulting flavor - dependence of the model , it inevitably lies at the center of any comparison between a given theoretical neutrino model and experimental data .",
    "indeed , experimentalists will eventually provide a unique numerical mixing matrix which incorporates the entire observed phenomenology of neutrino oscillations .",
    "it will then be the job of the theorist to solve the `` inverse '' problem of deducing the set of viable underlying neutrino models which can lead to this matrix .",
    "the non - minimal models with many bulk neutrinos contain many mixing angles and can therefore give rise to relatively diverse effective mixing matrices . however , one difficulty with the minimal model of ref .",
    "@xcite is that it leads to a rather rigid form for this effective mixing matrix .",
    "since the minimal model involves only one bulk neutrino , it yields an effective @xmath2 mixing matrix which , as we shall see , has a texture of the form  =   [ dsmassmatrix ] where the first three rows / columns correspond to the brane neutrinos and the final row / column corresponds to the bulk zero mode . here",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are parameters associated with the bulk of the higher - dimensional theory and its coupling to the brane , while @xmath1 are the bare majorana masses of the neutrinos on the brane . while we see that the bulk physics ( through the term @xmath3 ) is responsible for yielding a non - diagonal @xmath0 brane mixing submatrix , this matrix is relatively rigid , with all off - diagonal entries forced to be exactly equal .",
    "indeed , a mixing texture of this form may have difficulty accommodating observed neutrino oscillations of the correct sizes and magnitudes .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to propose an alternative `` minimal '' model which leads to a richer effective mixing matrix without introducing additional parameters or sacrificing any of the minimality of the single bulk - neutrino scheme . rather than incorporate a flavor structure through differing bare majorana masses @xmath1 on the brane as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we shall instead incorporate a non - trivial flavor structure within the context of the so - called `` split - fermion '' scenario  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the split - fermion scenario represents an intrinsically higher - dimensional method of explaining flavor hierarchies for the charged matter content of the standard model .",
    "however , as we shall discuss below , this method faces certain unique difficulties when attempting to address the flavor structure of the neutrino sector .",
    "thus , by combining the bulk - neutrino scenario with the split - fermion scenario , we are able to obtain a `` hybrid '' minimal model which has both strong theoretical motivations as well as rich prospects for neutrino phenomenology .",
    "in the split - fermion scenario  @xcite , the fermions of the standard model are located within a `` fat '' brane but centered around different positions within the brane .",
    "their spatial extent within the fat brane is modeled by a gaussian distribution with a typical width @xmath5 , where @xmath5 is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than the width of the brane .",
    "the gauge fields and the higgs are assumed to be equally distributed over the width of the brane . to obtain the effective four - dimensional couplings between different particles ,",
    "the extra dimensions have to be integrated out .",
    "since the overlap of the gaussian wavefunctions of the particles can be very small , the resulting effective couplings can be extremely suppressed .",
    "indeed , it is easy to obtain a suppression by thirty orders of magnitude by delocalizing particles at locations which are separated by about ten times their gaussian widths .",
    "this setup yields a solution to several problems .",
    "it can be used to suppress the proton decay , to suppress flavor - changing operators , or to explain the observed mass hierarchy in the lepton sector .",
    "many possible configurations of particles inside the brane are possible ; some of these are discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "relative shifts between left - handed standard - model doublets and right - handed singlets have been successfully used to address the mass hierarchy of quarks and charged leptons .",
    "but for the same reason the split - fermion scenario is easy to implement for charged fermions , it leads to difficulties when one tries to incorporate neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "experiments suggest with an increasing degree of certainty that neutrino mixing is maximal in the case of @xmath6 and almost maximal in the case of @xmath7 .",
    "the common textures of the zeroth - order neutrino mass matrix that are compatible with such almost - bimaximal mixing can be classified by the hierarchy type into different categories  normal , inverted , or degenerate .",
    "however , all of these situations require several entries to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "unfortunately , in the split - fermion scenario , the coupling between any two particles is extremely sensitive to their relative distance within the brane .",
    "the observed neutrino mixing can therefore be achieved only by carefully choosing the central locations of the neutrinos inside the brane .",
    "in addition , suitable positions for the charged leptons must be found in order to avoid excessive flavor - changing processes .",
    "together , these requirements put severe constraints on the allowed fermion locations  @xcite .",
    "while all experimental constraints can ultimately be accommodated , the resulting particle map is extremely sensitive to small perturbations .",
    "thus , even though these models reduce the amount of fine - tuning for the yukawa couplings , a considerable degree of fine - tuning continues to be necessary .",
    "there are , of course , various options for ameliorating this situation .",
    "for example , introducing majorana neutrinos rather than dirac neutrinos has been proposed  @xcite as a method of achieving reasonable neutrino masses within the split - fermion scenario .",
    "the neutrino sector of the split - fermion scenario has also recently been examined  @xcite within the context of the randall - sundrum model  @xcite .    in this paper , we will consider a different approach towards the neutrino sector by asking what consequences arise if the two scenarios  split fermions and bulk neutrinos  are examined in a joined framework . in this way",
    ", we shall be combining the strengths of each individual scenario : the split - fermion mechanism will trigger the flavor structure of the neutrino sector , while the bulk sector will ameliorate the fine - tuning issues and naturally lead to large mixing angles .",
    "indeed , it was already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite that the combination of having brane neutrinos at different locations in the extra dimension would trigger a higher - dimensional seesaw mechanism , although this idea was not pursued and no consistent framework was provided . in this paper , we shall see that split fermions provide a natural context for this phenomenon , leading to flavor - dependent mixing properties which can be used to distinguish between the brane neutrinos .",
    "there are also other benefits to combining these scenarios .",
    "for example , as we have mentioned , one difficulty of the split - fermion scenario applied to neutrinos has been that the mass matrix is exponentially sensitive to neutrino displacement within the brane .",
    "however , in our hybrid scenario , we shall see that the interactions between the brane and bulk naturally convert this dependence from exponential to linear .",
    "thus , the previous exponential sensitivity is entirely eliminated .",
    "another important feature is that our hybrid scenario provides its own natural regulator for kaluza - klein sums .",
    "thus , in our scenario , all such kaluza - klein summations are manifestly finite , even in cases with multiple extra dimensions . as we shall see",
    ", this arises because the heavy kaluza - klein modes with wavelengths that are small compared with the widths of the brane gaussians will average out when folded with the gaussian distribution .",
    "this thereby eliminates the necessity of introducing a cutoff by hand .    but most importantly",
    ", we shall find that our mechanism completely decouples the effective neutrino flavor mixing angles from the magnitudes of the neutrino overlaps within the brane .",
    "thus , we are able to obtain large neutrino mixing angles between neutrinos , even when these neutrinos have rather large spatial separations within the brane .",
    "we now describe the framework for our hybrid model .",
    "clearly , parts of this model will be similar to the model considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . for concreteness",
    ", we will work in this section with one bulk neutrino and one compactified extra dimension of radius @xmath8 , although the model can be trivially extended to more bulk fields and to more additional dimensions .",
    "the primary features of this model can be summarized as follows .",
    "we imagine a single extra dimension of radius @xmath8 , as well as a brane of width @xmath9 .    * on the brane , we introduce @xmath10 left - handed neutrinos @xmath11 ; these are our flavor eigenstates .",
    "we assume that these left - handed neutrinos have no corresponding majorana masses and are restricted to lie within the brane . * in the bulk , we introduce a single dirac fermion @xmath12 which does not carry any flavor indices and is therefore completely flavor - neutral .",
    "* for the sake of minimality , we assume that the left - handed neutrinos do not mix or couple to each other directly .",
    "thus , all mixing angles on the brane are set to zero .",
    "* we introduce a single flavor - blind brane / bulk coupling @xmath13 between each of the brane neutrinos @xmath11 and the bulk neutrino @xmath12 . * finally ,",
    "each of the active brane neutrinos @xmath11 is assumed to be centered around a different transverse location within the brane .",
    "it is this feature , and only this feature , which is introduces a flavor - dependence into our model .",
    "we shall take our spacetime coordinates as @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the four uncompactified coordinates on the brane and @xmath16 is the coordinate of the fifth dimension perpendicular to the brane . given the above assumptions",
    ", the action for our model then takes the form @xmath17 where @xmath18 describes the physics on the brane , @xmath19 describes the physics in the bulk , and @xmath20 describes the brane / bulk couplings .",

    "[ replace ] on the other hand , it is shown in appendix  b that the entries of @xmath109 continue to scale as @xmath110 regardless of the number or radii of extra dimensions .",
    "thus , for general @xmath108 , we obtain an effective @xmath111-dimensional mass matrix whose entries scale as m  ~   m _   [ tildemdelta ] where @xmath68 denotes a @xmath108-dependent set of flavor - dependent coefficients of order one .",
    "we shall not pursue a detailed calculation of these coefficients for @xmath107 , and shall instead rely on our previous results for @xmath112 as a general illustration of the potential possibilities for the flavor dependence .",
    "these observations are especially relevant for determining the neutrino mass eigenvalues resulting from our mass matrices .",
    "indeed , one of the unique features of these higher - dimensional scenarios involving right - handed neutrinos in the bulk is that it is the _ same _ mass matrix that determines not only the neutrino flavor mixings but also the neutrino mass eigenvalues .",
    "this is different from the traditional four - dimensional framework in which couplings to heavy right - handed neutrinos determine the neutrino masses ( through the traditional seesaw mechanism ) , whereas mixings amongst the light left - handed neutrinos are primarily responsible for determining the effective flavor mixing angles .",
    "it turns out that the eigenvalue phenomenology is very different depending on whether @xmath112 or @xmath107 . for @xmath112 , we have the mass matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ tildem2 ] ) .",
    "however , in this case the effective brane / bulk coupling @xmath4 is necessarily larger than the effective brane / brane components @xmath113 by a factor @xmath114 .",
    "thus , the mixing with the bulk zero mode is dominant and we must actually invert this ( @xmath58)-dimensional mass matrix in order to examine its mass eigenvalues .",
    "we find that in general , @xmath115 eigenvalues will be of ( the smaller ) size @xmath116 , while the remaining two eigenvalues will be of ( the larger ) size @xmath4 ; likewise , the eigenstates corresponding to @xmath117 will have an extremely small component involving the right - handed bulk neutrino , while the eigenstates corresponding to @xmath63 will have a fairly significantly component involving the right - handed bulk neutrino , with probability @xmath118 .",
    "thus , the @xmath115 lightest neutrino components are easily interpretable as our light flavor neutrino mass eigenstates  with significant flavor mixings amongst them  provided we choose @xmath10 to _ exceed _ our eventual desired number of light neutrinos by one .",
    "given these results , we see that our scenario for @xmath112 actually requires an _ additional _ left - handed neutrino on the brane which participates in the flavor oscillations but is otherwise exceedingly heavy . in some sense , this neutrino may be regarded as an additional `` sterile '' neutrino , since its flavor index need not correspond to any of the flavors exhibited by the charged fermions of the standard model ; moreover , by choosing an appropriate location for this neutrino , its flavor mixings with the other left - handed neutrinos can be minimized and/or eliminated .",
    "however , the unique prediction of this model ( as opposed to other higher - dimensional models ) is that this sterile neutrino is necessarily _ left - handed _ , living on the brane . of course",
    ", its mass is of the same scale ( @xmath119 ) as that of the right - handed zero - mode neutrino living in the bulk .",
    "note that the remaining kk bulk excitations have masses scaling as @xmath120 , and thus their masses are even heavier by an additional hierarchical factor of @xmath114 .    for @xmath107 , by contrast ,",
    "the brane / bulk coupling @xmath4 is suppressed by additional factors of @xmath121 relative to the brane / brane components @xmath113 .",
    "thus , assuming that @xmath122 , we see that the brane / bulk coupling will be extremely _ small _ compared to the brane / brane components , leading to @xmath10 eigenvalues of mass @xmath123 and a single eigenvalue of mass @xmath124 .",
    "although this single mass eigenstate will be much lighter than the @xmath10 active eigenstates , it will be overwhelmingly sterile and thus will not interact with the standard - model particles .",
    "we see , then , that regardless of the number of extra spacetime dimensions , our active neutrino mass eigenstates will have masses which scale as @xmath125 in the current setup .",
    "there are therefore a number of values for @xmath126 and @xmath5 which can yield neutrino masses in a phenomenologically acceptable range . one appealing possibility , for example , is to take @xmath126 ( the fundamental mass scale in our theory ) of order @xmath127 , while our three - branes have widths of order @xmath128 .",
    "by contrast , the only solution for which @xmath126 and @xmath129 are of the same order of magnitude requires that we take @xmath126 in the sub - ev range .",
    "likewise , if we demand @xmath130 , then we must take @xmath131@xmath132 .",
    "however , there are other ways of adjusting the overall mass eigenvalues in this scenario without affecting the flavor mixing angles . for example , if there are two extra dimensions whose coordinates are @xmath16 and @xmath133 , we can easily imagine that the standard - model brane is located at @xmath134 while the right handed neutrino has bulk excitations in the @xmath16-direction but is localized around @xmath135 .",
    "if both localizations have common width @xmath5 , we can retrace our previous steps to find that this location `` mismatch '' in the second extra dimension has the effect of inserting an extra suppression factor - 2 ( z_1-z_2)^2 ^ 2for each entry in the resulting effective mass matrix @xmath44 .",
    "while such an overall rescaling of the mass matrix does not affect the magnitudes of the flavor mixing angles , it directly suppresses the magnitudes of the mass eigenvalues .",
    "thus , in this way , we are free to adjust our mass eigenvalues as needed without disturbing the flavor structure of our model .",
    "other similar scenarios are also possible .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a `` hybrid '' model in which the split - fermion scenario and the bulk - neutrino scenario are joined together .",
    "as we have seen , this joining has succeeded in yielding a rich spectrum of flavor mixing angles without significant fine - tuning , thereby ameliorating some of the difficulties inherent in either approach alone .    needless to say ,",
    "we have pursued only the most `` minimal '' approach towards constructing this hybrid model .",
    "further possibilities that we have not exploited include , for example , possible variable widths of the gaussians  @xcite , the possibility of several right - handed neutrinos , possible orbifold twists  @xcite , or possible additional flavor - dependent yukawa couplings of order one .",
    "we have also avoided primordial flavor mixings on the brane , and we have taken our brane neutrinos to have vanishing majorana masses .",
    "while all of these assumptions can be relaxed , our main purpose in this paper has been to illustrate the range of theoretical possibilities that emerge solely from the joining of the split - fermion and bulk - neutrino models .",
    "likewise , we have not performed a detailed fit of the parameters involved , nor have we tried to embed this neutrino sector of the standard model within a larger split - fermion framework that also involves the quarks and charged leptons .",
    "however , we caution that in order to investigate whether such a hybrid model can accommodate all of the observed neutrino - oscillation properties , it is generally not sufficient merely to focus on reproducing the preferred mass differences and mixing angles often quoted in the neutrino literature . this is because such neutrino mixing parameters are usually quoted within the theoretical context of a simple two- or three - state neutrino mixing . in higher - dimensional neutrino models , by contrast , one usually faces very complex , multi - component neutrino oscillations with a variety of varying oscillation lengths and magnitudes ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite for examples of the complexities involved ) .",
    "indeed , even in the small - coupling limit @xmath61 , one typically has a four - neutrino ( or multi - neutrino ) oscillation , depending on the number of bulk neutrinos which are present .",
    "thus , in order to perform a proper comparison with experiment , one must go back to the original oscillation data , plotted in terms of appropriate baselines , and perform a direct fit between predicted and observed oscillation patterns ( and suitable time - averages thereof ) without regard for pre - existing theoretical prejudices .",
    "this too represents a direction for further investigation .",
    "there are also several important theoretical issues which we have not examined in this paper .",
    "one pressing issue , for example , concerns how such hybrid settings can arise on a fundamental level .",
    "although mechanisms of trapping fermions inside a fat brane have been examined closely , and although various ways to realize a split - fermion scenario seem to be possible , it would be interesting to have a more complete picture in which the required fermion locations can be explained from some deeper principle and/or generated dynamically .",
    "nevertheless , we have seen in this paper that joining the split - fermion and bulk - neutrino scenarios has produced a rich theoretical model which naturally gives rise to large neutrino flavor mixing angles without significant fine - tuning . indeed , it is the coupling to the kk modes of the bulk neutrino which eliminates the usual fine - tuning of the split - fermion scenario , and which produces the relatively large mixing angles that we have observed .",
    "thus , within the context of the split - fermion scenario , we have a natural explanation for the somewhat surprising fact that quark mixing angles are generally small while lepton mixing angles are apparently large : while the lepton sector contains a right - handed neutrino which is a gauge singlet and can therefore propagate in the bulk , all of the fields of the corresponding quark sector carry gauge charges and thus must live within the brane .",
    "thus only the lepton sector is capable of receiving the enhancement to the flavor mixing angles that comes indirectly from the couplings to the kk modes of the right - handed neutrino .",
    "we believe that this observation is critical , and perhaps provides one of the strongest motivations for considering such higher - dimensional models of neutrino phenomenology .",
    "this work is supported in part by the national science foundation under grant phy/0301998 , by the department of energy under grant  de - fg02 - 04er-41298 , and by a dfg grant from the german government .",
    "we are happy to thank z.  chacko , h .- s .",
    "goh , and s.  scherer for discussions .",
    "the neutrino mass matrix @xmath44 shows a typical structure which is common for seesaw scenarios .",
    "we can therefore analyze some of its features by similar means . following standard treatments ,",
    "let us write @xmath44 in the block form  =   where the @xmath136 block corresponds to the brane neutrinos as well as the zero mode of the bulk neutrino , where the @xmath137 block corresponds to the excited kk modes of the bulk neutrino , and where @xmath138 corresponds to the couplings between these two groups of states .",
    "assuming that these couplings are small ( _ i.e. _ , assuming @xmath61 , so that we are in the `` perturbative '' regime ) , we can then approximately block - diagonalize this matrix by finding a matrix @xmath139 such that u^t m u  =   . in general , the solution for @xmath139 is given by u  =    with    m_d m_r^-1  , whereupon we find m_l   m_l - m_d m_r^-1 m_d^t  ,   m_r   m_r  . since our original mass matrix is real and symmetric , the eigenvalues are necessarily real .",
    "the next - order corrections have the form @xmath140 , and an inspection shows that these are suppressed by a factor of @xmath141 relative to those considered above .",
    "likewise , the mixing between the excited kk modes and the brane / zero - mode subsector is suppressed by a factor of @xmath142 .",
    "note that in the above , we have chosen to group our blocks in such a way that the zero mode of the bulk neutrino is joined with the brane neutrinos rather than with the bulk - neutrino excited kk states .",
    "this is because the kk zero mode is the only mode from the kk tower which is not heavy , and which therefore fails to decouple . by arranging our blocks in this manner",
    ", we are therefore `` integrating out '' only the excited kk modes but retaining the zero mode in our low - energy reduced mass matrix @xmath143 .",
    "given the parameters in our specific model , a straightforward calculation gives  =   rn  , whereupon we find m_d^t & = & rn + & = & with m _",
    "=   -_n=1^ ( m^t_n,+ m^_n,-  +   m^t_n,- m^_n,+ )  . [ malphabeta ]",
    "we thus find _",
    "l   , whereupon inserting the definitions in eq .",
    "( [ couplings3 ] ) yields the result given in eq .",
    "( [ interm ] ) .",
    "we now consider the mass scales involved in our mass matrix @xmath144 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the mass scales associated with the expression @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ malphabeta ] ) .",
    "thus , there are three components of this expression that we need to generalize to @xmath108 dimensions : we need to generalize the couplings @xmath36 ; we need to generalize expressions such as @xmath145 ; and we need to generalize the kk sum",
    ". we shall therefore begin by addressing each of these in turn .    for excitations of the bulk field in more than one extra spacetime dimension , the kaluza - klein expansion in eq .",
    "( [ kkdecomp ] ) will now involve products of sines and cosines .",
    "this in turn means that the couplings @xmath36 in eq .",
    "( [ couplings3 ] ) will also be products of sines and cosines whose arguments display the positions @xmath146 of our fields .",
    "likewise , the form of the higher - dimensional clifford algebra implies that a dirac spinor in @xmath147 spacetime dimensions will have @xmath148 components , and the inverse of the wave vector @xmath37 will be a linear combination of its components .",
    "however , since our goal is merely to estimate relevant mass scales , we shall ignore these spinorial details and retain a notation whereby we treat quantities such as @xmath145 as a single number .",
    "let us now put these ingredients together .",
    "first , we notice that in the higher - dimensional case with @xmath107 , the couplings from eq .",
    "( [ kkdecomp ] ) will enter into eq .",
    "( [ fdef ] ) only for mixtures of even and odd fields .",
    "this means that the factors that must be summed as part of the @xmath37-summation will consist of at least one sine function and one cosine function . since the contributions to this sum are naturally damped beyond @xmath151 , and since we assume the locations @xmath152 to be of order @xmath5 , we can approximate each occurrence of the sine function by the linear term in its taylor expansion ( and set each cosine factor to @xmath100 ) .",
    "let @xmath153 denote the number of sine functions in the product , where @xmath154 , and likewise let @xmath155 denote those directions for which these sine functions appear .",
    "each of these sine functions will then make a linear contribution to @xmath113 of the form @xmath156 , whereupon we find that eqs .",
    "( [ 8ev ] ) and ( [ fdef ] ) will generalize to yield an expression of the form m _",
    "~   m^2 r _ n ( - ) _ i=1^s ( y_i )  .",
    "note that this @xmath37-summation continues to represent a sum over @xmath108-dimensional vectors @xmath37 .",
    "defining @xmath157 , we see that this sum can be approximated by an integral m _  ~   m^2 r^^-1 _ i ( y_i/ ) d k   k^+s-2 ( - k^2/^2 )  .",
    "[ step ] however , the integral is now purely dimensionless and @xmath158 ; likewise , for @xmath159 , we see that each of the product factors are also @xmath158 .",
    "thus the overall mass scale is set by the prefactor in eq .",
    "( [ step ] ) . however , given the result in eq .",
    "( [ replace ] ) , we see that we can write this prefactor in the form @xmath160 , obtaining the same overall mass scale as we found for @xmath112 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the overall mass scale for @xmath113 is independent of both @xmath8 and @xmath108 . indeed , it is easy to verify that this result remains true even when all of the proper numerical and spinorial factors are included in the analysis .",
