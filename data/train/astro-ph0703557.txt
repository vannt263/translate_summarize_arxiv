    "over the last twenty years , growing evidence has accumulated that early - type galaxies ( e / s0s ) have detectable amounts of cold gas , sometimes settled in a disc , and recent star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "many e / s0s also show photometric and kinematic evidence of central stellar discs ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , the presence of which correlates with both nuclear and global properties ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , many e / s0s show evidence for so - called kinematically decoupled cores ( kdcs ) , i.e.kinematically misaligned central components ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these point to the accretion of external material , question the importance of dissipation , and may indicate triaxial figures .",
    "however , for both central discs and kdcs , the connection between stellar and gaseous components remains unclear .",
    "discs in ellipticals can form simultaneously with their host , from the major mergers of gas - rich galaxies .",
    "there has been evidence for this scenario for a number of years ( see @xcite for ngc  7252 ; @xcite for a review ) , and recent numerical simulations illustrate how the disc formation may happen ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in those mergers , roughly half the gas",
    "is quickly funneled to the center , some causing a burst of star formation and much settling in a high surface density , mostly molecular central disc ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the other half is ejected to large distances but remains bound to the merger remnant ( the new galaxy ) .",
    "this high angular momentum diffuse gas eventually falls back and may settle into a more extended , large - scale disc .",
    "alternatively , some gas could come from stellar mass loss from evolved stars , and @xcite recently proposed that essentially all the molecular gas found in the center of s0s does come from ( internal ) stellar mass return , while the atomic gas ( hi ) mainly originates from external sources ( merger - driven infall , captured dwarfs , regular cold accretion , etc ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is as yet not understood why early - type galaxies only possess @xmath4 of the gas expected from internal mass loss ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there have been several co emission surveys of early - type galaxies ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see also the compilation by @xcite ) , revealing that early - types are not always devoid of gas , and can even show a substantial amount of co emission .",
    "@xcite mapped co emission in seven es , revealing regularly rotating molecular discs in all of them .",
    "she showed that these gas discs should be forming stellar discs with approximately the same size and mass as typically observed in es ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , at the present , we know of no e / s0 galaxy with appropriate data to establish a direct causal link between the molecular gas and the stellar disc ( or kdc ) .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy is by far the best tool to study those decoupled components , but there is simply no overlap between the existing co and integral - field samples .",
    "the recently completed sauron survey , however , offers a unique opportunity to reverse this trend .    using a custom - designed panoramic integral - field spectrograph @xcite ,",
    "the sauron team have mapped the stellar kinematics of a large representative sample of early - type galaxies in the north ( see @xcite for the sample definition and preliminary results ) .",
    "both the quantity and quality of these data represent tremendous improvements over previously available observations of e / s0s .",
    "contrary to expectations , most galaxies show evidence of kinematic subcomponents which can be uniquely identified and characterised with the new integral - field maps .",
    "kinematic misalignments , twists , dynamically cold subcomponents , and kdcs are all common @xcite",
    ". roughly half of sauron e / s0s show kinematic evidence of a central disc .",
    "in addition to the stellar distribution and kinematics ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xcite ) , sauron simultaneously maps the ionised - gas distribution and kinematics ( h@xmath2 , [ o iii ] and [ n i ] lines ; @xcite ) , as well as the age , metallicity and overabundance of the stellar populations ( through the h@xmath2 , mg@xmath3 , fe5015 and fe5270 line - strength indices ; @xcite ) .",
    "the central stellar discs and kdcs are often accompanied by ionised - gas discs , but not always .",
    "similarly , while most appear old , not all are .",
    "this wealth of information is , however , not yet assembled into a complete picture of the current state and formation history of these discs and kdcs .",
    "to better understand the varied phenomena seen in the stellar and ionised - gas data , a detailed comparison with molecular gas is warranted . as only a few sauron",
    "early - type galaxies had a co detection , we recently carried out a single - dish co survey of most sauron e / s0s using the iram 30  m telescope .",

    "their radio continuum emission is most likely dominated by agn activity @xcite .",
    "two galaxies fall in the ir - excess category , which is more poorly understood .",
    "as discussed more fully by @xcite , an ir excess may indicate unusually warm dust from a compact starburst or a dust - enshrouded agn .",
    "alternatively , an ir excess could suggest that the galaxy has a smaller - than - usual synchrotron output due to a weak interstellar magnetic field .",
    "such ir excesses are rare , however , only accounting for @xmath49 of @xmath40 ir - selected galaxies in the sample of @xcite . in our sample",
    ", @xmath50 galaxies having both co data and a @xmath46 value lie within the `` average '' band of @xmath51 , although @xmath52 of those only have upper limits for their radio continuum flux , and could conceivably move into the ir - excess category if their radio continuum fluxes are a good deal smaller than the current @xmath53  mjy limit .",
    "the co detection rate is significantly lower among the radio - excess galaxies ( @xmath54 or @xmath55 ) than among the `` average '' and ir - excess galaxies ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) ( both ir - excess galaxies are detected ) .",
    "thus , early - type galaxies with @xmath58 are more likely to also contain molecular gas , the raw material for star formation .",
    "this association between molecular gas and @xmath58 bolsters the contention of @xcite that early - type galaxies with a @xmath46 value similar to that of spirals are also experiencing star formation .    if it is true that early - type galaxies with @xmath58 have fir and radio emissions which are primarily powered by star formation , then @xmath59 of the @xmath48 sauron early - type galaxies with co data and estimated @xmath46 values show evidence for star formation activity .",
    "curiously , however , several galaxies which are not detected in co emission also have @xmath60 .",
    "especially notable are ngc2974 , ngc3414 , ngc4546 and ngc5838 , which have fir and radio fluxes within the ranges occupied by galaxies detected in co ( e.g.fig .  [ fig:1.4vs60 ] ) . on the other hand , ngc2974 does show evidence for recent star formation in the ultraviolet @xcite , and all four galaxies have substantial amounts of ionised gas ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "if @xmath60 really is an indicator of star formation activity , then perhaps these galaxies have abundant molecular gas but low co / h@xmath61 ratios , or alternatively they could have smaller molecular gas contents but more efficient star formation .",
    "there might even also be some other processes beside star formation which produce their fir and radio fluxes .",
    "the entire sample having co data contains @xmath62 galaxies traditionally classified as elliptical and @xmath63 lenticulars . as discussed in section  [ sec : incidence ] , co is detected in only @xmath22 ellipticals but in @xmath64 lenticulars , a much higher detection rate .",
    "in contrast , the ellipticals show more agn activity . of all galaxies for which we could calculate @xmath46 ( see table  [ tab : qfirad ] ) , @xmath49 of @xmath65 ellipticals show a radio excess but none of the @xmath65 s0s does .",
    "we caution however that detailed studies of the morphology and kinematics of the sauron early - type galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) prompt some reclassifications .",
    "we surveyed in the co(1 - 0 ) and co(2 - 1 ) lines early - type galaxies observed in the optical with the sauron integral - field spectrograph .",
    "taking into account literature results , the detection rate for the sauron representative sample of @xmath12 e / s0s is 12/43 or @xmath1 . this is lower than previous surveys but differences",
    "can probably be explained by differences between the samples .",
    "our data extend the usual correlations between fir luminosity , dust mass and molecular mass of later galaxy types , as well as the related correlation between star formation and molecular gas surface density .",
    "unsurprisingly , the more massive and luminous earlier type galaxies have a relatively lower molecular gas content and the local galaxy density does not appear to have a strong effect on the molecular content .    although weak , indicative trends are nevertheless observed with various optical absorption line - strength indices .",
    "co - rich galaxies tend to have higher h@xmath2 and lower fe5015 and mg@xmath3 indices .",
    "co - rich galaxies also show the strongest evidence of star formation , probed in a variety of ways , suggesting that those trends are primarily driven by stellar age .",
    "analysing the fir and radio fluxes , we similarly see that so - called `` radio - excess '' galaxies , presumably powered by active galactic nuclei , are significantly poorer in molecular gas than so - called `` ir - excess '' galaxies , presumably powered by star formation .",
    "these trends support the recent _ galaxy evolution explorer _ ( galex ) ultraviolet results ( among others ) , which suggest that a significant number of early - type galaxies may be undergoing a small amount of star formation activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ", however , we have apparently found the raw material for this residual star formation , and have demonstrated that it is actively being transformed .",
    "this might not be surprising in spiral galaxies , but it is a significant step for early - types .",
    "overall , however , the weakness of the correlations between the co content and most optically - derived parameters suggests that , in many of these galaxies , the molecular gas does not come from internal sources such as stellar mass loss .",
    "instead the gas has probably been accreted and has properties largely independent from the old stellar component .",
    "the current co detections offer the possibility to pursue those issues with much improved spatially - resolved synthesis data , which can be directly compared to optical integral - field observations at similar spatial resolution .",
    "much work along those lines is already ongoing .",
    "the authors would like to thank the many people from the sauron team , and in particular eric emsellem , for useful discussions .",
