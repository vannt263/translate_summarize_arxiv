    "large eddy simulation ( les ) is one of the most successful techniques in the numerical simulation of turbulent flows .",
    "contrary to the direct numerical simulation ( dns ) , which tries to capture all the scales in the flow , les aims at resolving only the large - scale flow features .",
    "the large scales are defined by means of a filtering operation : the navier - stokes equations are convolved with a spatial filter , and the resulting filtered variables become the variables of interest in les .",
    "thus , a good les model should be able to compute an accurate approximation of the filtered variables .",
    "an essential challenge in les is the modeling of the subgrid - scale ( sgs ) stresses , representing the interactions between the large ( above the filter width ) and small ( below the filter width ) scales in the filtered navier - stokes equations .",
    "a remarkable research effort has led to a wide variety of sgs models , surveyed , for example , in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "arguably the most popular class of les models is the eddy - viscosity type , based on ( variants of ) the smagorinsky model @xcite .",
    "the main feature of the eddy - viscosity models is that they properly transfer kinetic energy ( by inviscid processes ) from large scales to smaller and smaller scales , until this energy is dissipated through viscous effects .",
    "these models have several limitations , however , including poor correlation coefficients in a priori tests @xcite , @xcite and inability to provide backscatter .",
    "some of these limitations are circumvented by using a dynamic procedure in calculating the smagorinsky constant , yielding the dynamic subgrid - scale eddy - viscosity model introduced by germano et al .",
    "@xcite , and used in many studies @xcite , @xcite .    another class of sgs models is the scale - similarity one . the scale - similarity model , introduced by bardina et al .",
    "@xcite , postulates that the full structure of the velocity field at scales below the filter width is similar to that at scales above the filter width .",
    "a priori tests @xcite show high correlations between real and modeled stresses .",
    "another realistic feature of the scale - similarity model is that it produces backscatter . in a posteriori tests ,",
    "however , the scale - similarity model does not dissipate enough energy and typically leads to inaccurate results . as a remedy , bardina et al .",
    "@xcite added a dissipative smagorinsky term .",
    "the resulting model , known as the mixed model , combines the strengths of both the scale - similarity and the smagorinsky model .",
    "the dynamic procedure has been successfully applied to both the pure and the mixed scale - similarity model , yielding improved results @xcite .",
    "a different class of sgs models consists of those models aimed at computing an improved sgs stress approximation by replacing the unknown unfiltered variables with approximately deconvolved filtered variables .",
    "an inverse filtered model was first proposed by shah and ferziger @xcite .",
    "this idea was formalized by geurts @xcite for the top hat filter .",
    "kuerten et al .",
    "@xcite used the approximate inverse to improve the computable estimates in the dynamic smagorinsky model .",
    "another model in this class is the velocity estimation model of domaradzki and saiki @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "stolz and adams @xcite developed the approximate deconvolution model , based on repeated application of the filter to approximately deconvolve the dependent variables @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one popular model in this class is the gradient model ( also known as the nonlinear or tensor - diffusivity model ) , which uses _ explicit _ filtering .",
    "in addition to the _ implicit _ filtering due to the effective truncations ( grid and numerical method ) , this les model also assumes a regular explicit filter of prescribed shape and effective width larger than the grid spacing .",
    "the gradient model is based on a taylor series approximation of the fourier transform of the filter and aims at reconstructing the filtered - scale stress due to explicit filtering .",
    "the gradient model was developed in several steps .",
    "first , in 1974 leonard @xcite proposed a model for the `` resolved scales '' @xmath2 in the reynolds stress tensor .",
    "next , in 1979 clark , ferziger , and reynolds @xcite used the same approach to model the `` cross - terms '' @xmath3 .",
    "the gradient model was tested a priori against experimental data ( two - dimensional cuts ) by liu et al .",
    "borue and orszag @xcite presented a detailed a priori analysis of the gradient model based on gaussian - filtered dns of homogeneous , isotropic decaying turbulence . also , winckelmans et al .",
    "@xcite presented several a priori tests for the gradient model and its dynamic version , again in the context of homogeneous , isotropic decaying turbulence .",
    "similar tests have been performed by carati et al .",
    "all the above a priori tests have shown high correlations .    in _ a posteriori _ tests , however , it was found that the gradient model does not dissipate enough energy .",
    "simulations with the pure gradient model appear to be unstable @xcite . also , liu , meneveau , and katz @xcite reported problems near the wall , where the pure gradient model s reynolds stresses do not follow the @xmath4 behavior . to stabilize the gradient model , clark , ferziger , and reynolds @xcite combined it with a smagorinsky term , but the resulting mixed model inherited the excessive dissipation of the smagorinsky model .",
    "a different approach was proposed by liu et al .",
    "@xcite , who supplied the gradient model with a `` limiter '' to prevent energy backscatter ; this clipping procedure ensures that the model dissipates energy from large to small scales .",
    "this approach was also used in @xcite , @xcite .    from this point of view",
    ", the gradient model is similar to the scale - similarity model : it shows high correlations in a priori tests , but it does not dissipate enough energy in actual les simulations : hence the need for extra viscosity type terms ( mixed models ) .",
    "we note that , for both types of model , the best results in actual les simulations were obtained by using the dynamic mixed procedure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been noted before @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , that there are strong ties between the gradient model and the scale - similarity model : the first term in the taylor series expansion of the scale - similarity model is indeed the gradient model . as noted by winckelmans et al .",
    "@xcite , however , the other terms in the expansion are different .",
    "thus , the gradient model is not identical to the scale - similarity model .",
    "the model presented in this paper was introduced by galdi and layton @xcite as an alternative to the gradient model .",
    "they observed that the taylor series approximation of the fourier transform of the gaussian filter used in the derivation of the gradient model actually _ increases _ the high wave number components , instead of damping them .",
    "as an alternative to the taylor series approximation , galdi and layton proposed a rational ( ( 0,1 ) pad ) approximation .",
    "this rational approximation is consistent with the original approximated function ( which is a negative exponential ) : it attenuates the high wave number components .    in this paper , the resulting les model , called in the sequel the rational les ( rles ) model , is applied to the numerical simulations of incompressible channel flows at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "the usual les starts by convolving the navier - stokes equations ( nses ) with a spatial filter @xmath5 . assuming that differentiation and convolution commute ( which is true for homogeneous filters )",
    ", the filtered nses read as follows : @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the filter width and @xmath8 is the variable of interest . the filtered nses ( [ filtered_nses ] )",
    "do not form a closed system , and a considerable research effort in les research has been directed at modeling the stress @xmath9    as mentioned by carati et al .",
    "@xcite , this stress consists of a filtered - scale stress tensor , mainly due to filtering , and a subgrid - scale ( sgs ) stress tensor , mainly due to discretization .",
    "one way of approximating the filtered - scale stress tensor is by using a taylor series expansion in the wave number space to represent the unknown full velocity in terms of the filtered velocity .",
    "this approach was first used by leonard @xcite , and it was later espoused by clark , ferziger , and reynolds @xcite .",
    "the resulting model , called the gradient , nonlinear , or tensor - diffusivity model , was used in numerous studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gradient model is derived by using a taylor series approximation to the fourier transform of the gaussian filter @xmath10    and for its inverse @xmath11    decomposing @xmath12 into its average and its turbulent fluctuations @xmath13    and taking first the average and then the fourier transform of the above relation , we get @xmath14    and thus , @xmath15    where @xmath16 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath12 .    by taking the inverse fourier transform and using ( [ taylor.approx.inverse ] ) ,",
    "we get @xmath17    by plugging the above into ( [ stress ] ) , using ( [ taylor.approx ] ) and the same technique as above , simplifying , and dropping out the terms of @xmath18 , we get the gradient model @xmath19    where @xmath20    noticing that the approximation by taylor series of @xmath21 actually _ increases _ the high wave number components ( see figure [ rational.vs.taylor ] ) , galdi and layton @xcite developed a new les model based on a rational ( ( 0,1 ) pad ) approximation of @xmath21 , which preserves the decay of the high wave number components : @xmath22    the resulting les model , called the rational les ( rles ) model , reads as follows : @xmath23 .",

    "we note that differential filters have been proposed by germano in @xcite : actually , one can think of ( [ rational.les ] ) as the stress tensor obtained by applying such a differential filter .",
    "mullen and fischer used similar filters in @xcite . also , domaradzki and holm considered the navier - stokes - alpha model ( which contains an inverse operator similar to the one in ( [ rational.les ] ) ) , in an les framework @xcite .",
    "the mathematical analysis associated with the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) was presented in @xcite ; the smoothing property of the inverse operator in ( [ rational.les ] ) eliminated the necessity for using additional regularization operators ( of eddy - viscosity type ) , as for the gradient model @xcite .",
    "the first steps in the numerical analysis and validation of the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) were made in @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "this paper presents numerical results for the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) applied to the 3d channel flow test problem at reynolds numbers based on the wall shear velocity @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "some preliminary work started in @xcite ; it was significantly updated and improved in the present paper .",
    "the 3d channel flow ( figure [ channel ] ) is one of the most popular test problems for the investigation of wall bounded turbulent flows @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we used the fine dns of moser , kim , and mansour @xcite as benchmark for our les simulations .",

    "the numerical simulations were performed by using a spectral element code based on the @xmath36 velocity and pressure spaces introduced by maday and patera @xcite .",
    "the domain is decomposed into spectral elements , as shown in figure [ mesh ] .",
    "mesh spacing in the wall - normal direction ( @xmath37 ) was chosen to be roughly equivalent to a chebychev distribution having the same number of points .",

    "time stepping is based on an operator - splitting of the discrete system , which leads to separate convective , viscous , and pressure subproblems without the need for ad hoc pressure boundary conditions . a filter , which removes 2%5% of the highest velocity mode , is used to stabilize the galerkin formulation @xcite ; the filter does not compromise the spectral accuracy .",
    "details of the discretization and solution algorithm are given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the initial conditions for the @xmath0 simulations were obtained by superimposing a 2d tollmien - schlichting ( ts ) mode of 2% amplitude and a 3d ts mode of 1% amplitude on a parabolic mean flow ( poiseuille flow ) and integrating the flow for a long time ( approximately 200 h/@xmath40 , where h is the channel s halfwidth and @xmath40 is the wall shear velocity ) on a finer mesh ( @xmath41 mesh points ) .",

    "then , we integrated the resulting flow on the actual coarser les mesh ( @xmath44 mesh points ) for another 40 h/@xmath40 , and the final field file was used as initial condition for _ all _ four simulations .    for each of the four simulations and for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 ,",
    "the flow was integrated further in time until the statistically steady state was reached ( for approximately 15 h/@xmath40 ) .",
    "the statistically steady state was identified by a linear total shear stress profile ( see figure [ figure0a ] and figure [ figure0b ] ) .",
    "the statistics were then collected over another 5 h/@xmath40 and contained samples taken after each time step ( @xmath45 for @xmath0 and @xmath46 for @xmath1 ) .",
    "we also averaged over the two halves of the channel .    in our numerical experiments , we considered , as a first step , homogeneous boundary conditions for all les models tested .",

    "similarly , the normalized rms values of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure3a ] show a better ( closer to the fine dns benchmark results in @xcite ) behavior for the rles model ( [ rational.les ] )",
    ".    figures [ figure4a ] and [ figure5a ] , containing the normalized rms values for the wall - normal and spanwise velocity fluctuations , merit a more detailed discussion . figure [ figure4a ] shows the normalized rms values of the wall - normal velocity fluctuations . here , the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) performs worse than the gradient model ( [ gradient.model ] ) near the wall .",
    "away from the wall , the gradient and the rles model perform similarly .",
    "the best results are obtained with the smagorinsky model .",
    "the normalized rms values of the spanwise velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure5a ] are better for the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) than for the gradient model , except for a portion of @xmath62 roughly between 0.3 and 0.5 .",
    "the smagorinsky model gives the best results near the wall , but it overpredicts the correct value near the center of the channel .    in conclusion , the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) performs better than the gradient model , with the exception of the normalized rms values of the wall - normal velocity fluctuations .",
    "the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) is also more stable numerically than the gradient model .",
    "we ran simulations with all four models for @xmath1 , and we compared our results with the fine dns in @xcite . again , as in the @xmath0 case , the normalized mean streamwise velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure1b ] are practically identical ; this time , however , they do not overlap onto that corresponding to the fine dns . nevertheless , the mean flows are the same , and this is supported by the fact that the models underpredict the correct value near the wall but overpredict it away from the wall .",
    "the normalized @xmath48-component of the reynolds stress in figure [ figure2b ] is almost identical for all four models .",
    "this behavior was also noticed by winckelmans et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the same behavior can be noticed for the normalized rms values of the streamwise velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure3b ] : the profiles for the four models are almost identical .",
    "the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) performs slightly better near the wall , and the gradient model performs slightly better away from the wall .",
    "they both perform better than the smagorinsky model near the center of the channel .",
    "figure [ figure4b ] presents the normalized rms values of the wall - normal velocity fluctuations . as for the @xmath0 case",
    ", the gradient model performs better near the wall , and the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) performs better away from the wall .",
    "the smagorinsky model performs best , but it overpredicts the correct value near the center of the channel .    the same behavior is observed for the normalized rms values of the spanwise velocity fluctuations in figure [ figure5b ] , and again the smagorinsky model performs best .    in conclusion , for the @xmath1 case ,",
    "the gradient and the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) yield comparable results .",
    "the best results , however , are obtained by using the smagorinsky model .    again , as in the @xmath0 case , the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) is much more stable numerically than the gradient model .",
    "we have used a spectral element code to test the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) in the numerical simulation of incompressible channel flows at @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "this approximate deconvolution model is based on a rational ( pad ) approximation to the fourier transform of the gaussian filter and is proposed as an alternative to the gradient model ( [ gradient.model ] ) .",
    "we compared the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) with the gradient model , the smagorinsky model , and a coarse dns ( no les model ) .",
    "the corresponding results were benchmarked against the fine dns calculation of moser , kim , and mansour @xcite .",
    "the situation was different for the @xmath1 case . here the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) and the gradient model yielded comparable results , and the smagorinsky model performed the best .",
    "again , the rles model ( [ rational.les ] ) was much more stable numerically than the gradient model .",
    "we believe that these results for the rles model are encouraging .",
    "they also support our initial thoughts : the rles model is an improvement over the gradient model as a subfilter - scale model , and this is illustrated by the improved results for the @xmath0 case . the rles model is also more stable numerically because of the additional smoothing operator , and this feature is manifest for both low ( @xmath0 ) and moderate ( @xmath1 ) reynolds number flows .    however , the rles model accounts just for the subfilter - scale part of the stress reconstruction .",
    "the information lost at the subgrid - scale level must be accounted for in a different way , as advocated by carati et al .",
    "this was illustrated by the fact that , even for a moderate reynolds number ( @xmath1 ) flow , the smagorinsky model , a classical eddy - viscosity model , performed best .",
    "along these lines , our next step will be to develop a mixed model , consisting of the rles model supplemented by a smagorinsky model .",
    "we also plan to study improved boundary conditions , the commutation error @xcite , @xcite , and the relationship between the filter radius and the mesh - size in a spectral element discretization .",
