    "after more than two decades of grb observations their physical nature and distances remain largely a mystery .",
    "the distribution of bursts is isotropic in the sky ( quashnock 1996 , tegmark 1996 ) .",
    "this observation rules out galactic disk / bulge models , but leaves galactic halo ( lamb 1995 ) and cosmological models as possible scenarios .",
    "the spectroscopy detectors on board the compton gamma ray observatory detected no convincing spectral features to help determine grb redshifts ( palmer 1993 ) .",
    "searching for counterparts of grbs at other wavelengths ( optical , ir , x - rays ) could help determine their distances , however none were found within the error boxes of grbs ( shaefer 1993 , but see irwin & ytkow 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , the lack of any bright optical or ir galaxies in the error boxes of 10 brightest grbs indicates that the bursts must originate at distances greater than 1 gpc ( shaefer 1990 ) .",
    "if the bursts are extragalactic , they may be expected to trace luminous matter in the universe .",
    "for example , if they are associated with coalescing black holes or neutron stars , their rate would be roughly proportional to the density of normal stellar populations .",
    "in particular , the bursts should have clustering properties similar to those of the galaxies .",
    "all attempts to find angular correlation of grbs with themselves ( blumenthal 1993 , quashnock 1996 , tegmark 1996 ) , and with nearby cosmological structures ( hartmann 1996 , nemiroff 1993 ) have so far failed .",
    "these non - detections can be used to place lower limits on the  effective \" distance to the grb population . using grbs from the 1b catalog , blumenthal ( 1993 )",
    "derive a lower limit of @xmath7 .",
    "if typical faint grbs were any closer one would detect a positive angular correlation signal , since a smaller effective distance means less smearing of the clustering signal due to projection effects .",
    "based on the data from the 3b catalog , quashnock ( 1996 ) derives a minimum sampling distance of @xmath8 , at 95% confidence level .",
    "based on the lack of any supergalactic anisotropies , hartmann ( 1996 ) derive a minimum sampling distance of @xmath9 .",
    "all auto- and cross- correlation analyses with the batse catalog are restricted to angles greater than @xmath10 .",
    "smaller separations can not be probed reliably because of the low surface density of the bursts ( roughly 1 grb per 40 square degrees in the 3b catalog ) , and more importantly , because of the large positional errors in the burst locations .",
    "positions of individual grbs in the batse catalog suffer from random and systematic errors .",
    "the random errors range from 0.5 to 15 degrees depending on the flux of the grb , while the systematic errors are about 4 degrees ( graziani & lamb 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the effect of weak gravitational lensing on the distribution of grbs .",
    "if the grbs are standard candles and trace the luminous matter , should we expect to see weak lensing effects in the angular distribution of bursts of all fluxes ?    to show how weak lensing could affect the observed distribution of grbs one can explore the following toy model .",
    "imagine a positive density inhomogeneity ( a clump of galaxies ) located somewhere between us and the typical faint grbs .",
    "the clump itself will produce an increase in the number of grbs seen in that direction .",
    "it will also act as a lens for the background matter .",
    "the effects of lensing can be calculated in a straightforward fashion . due to flux magnification",
    ", the maximum redshift of observed grbs will be extended , and the surface number density of background grbs will be diluted ; therefore , that direction in the sky will have an excess of bursts due to the galaxy clump and lensing flux magnification , as well as a deficit due to lensing area distortion .",
    "how do the strengths of these effects compare ? in section 2 we will see that lensing can produce changes in the distribution of grbs at the level of several percent . due to projection effects",
    ", however , the signal will be smeared out and is not expected to be seen in the current data sets .    before proceeding , we would like to note that the influence of strong lensing on grbs has been considered in the literature , see paczyski ( 1986 , 1987 ) .",
    "in general , if grbs extend to @xmath11 , the fraction of strongly lensed bursts should be comparable to that of qsos , @xmath12 in every 500 grbs should be multiply imaged ( see maoz & rix 1993 ) .",
    "therefore there could be several multiply imaged grbs in the current batse catalog .",
    "throughout this paper we assume that grbs are cosmological in origin , all the bursts have identical spectral properties , and identical luminosities .",
    "we assume that the luminosity and number density of grbs do not evolve with redshift .",
    "there is no convincing physical reason for such simplifications , except that a model based on these very simple assumptions correctly predicts the log@xmath13-log@xmath14 distribution of sources over 3 decades in flux ( mao & paczyski 1992 ) .    in particular , bright bursts have a cumulative number counts distribution with slope of @xmath15 , expected from a uniform spatial distribution of nonevolving sources in flat space .",
    "in addition , the well documented roll - off in the observed number counts of grbs at faint fluxes is competely consistent with the geometry of an expanding universe .",
    "the minimum distance to the faintest grbs , derived using best fits to the log@xmath13-log@xmath14 curves , is @xmath16 ( wickramasinghe 1993 , mao & paczyski 1992 ) .",
    "these distances are in agreement with the lower limits derived using auto- and cross- correlation analyses ( see introduction ) .",
    "one must remember , however , that the assumptions of no - evolution and single intrinsic burst luminosity are not necessary , and may not be sufficient to describe the current grb data .    we assume , following mao and paczyski ( 1992 ) , that the spectral slope of the grbs is @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 , and the flux from a burst at @xmath19 is given by @xmath20,\\eqno(1)\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the luminosity distance .",
    "spectral slope is important for k - corrections and determination of observed fluxes , since the frequency range of the batse detector corresponds to different energy bands depending on the source redshift .",
    "since the bursts are assumed to be standard candles , the maximum redshift of observed grbs , @xmath22 , is directly related to the faintest detectable flux , @xmath23 , through equation ( 1 ) .",
    "cosmological time dilation affects grbs in two ways : it changes the durations of individual bursts , as well as the rate of events seen by the observer .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the time dilation of event durations may have already been detected ( norris 1994 , norris 1996 , but see brainerd 1994 ) . in the present work time",
    "dilation of individual events will not be important .",
    "only the reduction of grb rate with redshift is relevant for us here .",
    "we assume that the rate of production of grbs is proportional to the density of luminous matter .",
    "also , the mass distribution on large scales is traced by the light distribution .",
    "this assertion is consistent with the observations of the large scale flows ; the mass density , reconstructed from the peculiar velocity field of the galaxies , agrees reasonably well with the galaxy distribution ( dekel 1994 ) .",
    "we consider three sets of cosmological parameters , ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)=(1 , 0 ) , ( 0.2 , 0 ) , and ( 0.2 , 0.8 ) , and a hubble constant of 75 km  s@xmath24  mpc@xmath24 where appropriate .",
    "it is instructive to study lensing effects due to a single isolated density inhomogeneity .",
    "imagine looking at a patch of the sky of angular diameter @xmath25 .",
    "grbs in that patch will originate from a range of redshifts , or from a conical ` tube ' with its apex at the observer and extending up to @xmath22 .",
    "let the mass distribution within the tube be completely smooth .",
    "the rate of grbs ( of all fluxes ) from that tube , as seen by an observer , is proportional to @xmath26 , where subscript @xmath27 stands for ` unlensed ' .",
    "let us now place a mass concentration ( a ` clump ' ) at a redshift @xmath28 within this tube , centered on the tube s axis .",
    "let the clump contribute an additional rate of grbs proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "the clump will weakly lense the background sources , thereby altering the rate of grbs originating in the tube",
    ". the altered rate of grbs from the tube alone is proportional to @xmath30 , where subscript @xmath31 stands for ` lensed ' .    the average , background subtracted",
    ", surface mass density of the clump , @xmath32 , is assumed to be proportional to @xmath33 , within radius @xmath34 .",
    "this relation can be normalized such that @xmath35 , a constant .",
    "a reasonable value for @xmath36 is probably around 1 , corresponding to a singular isothermal sphere , or 0.8 , which is the slope of the observed angular correlation function of galaxies .",
    "the exact values of @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not important , as will be shown later ( see equation [ 7 ] ) .    since the angular scales that can be probed with the grb population are of the order of a few degrees or more , the cosmological structures defined by such scales are correspondingly large in extent and represent small deviations from the average mass density of the universe . to illustrate this , consider an angular scale of 10 degrees , about the smallest angular scale that can be reliably sampled with the batse data , given both systematic and random positional errors",
    "at a nearby distance of @xmath38 , @xmath39 corresponds to @xmath40mpc . on this scale ,",
    "the rms scatter in @xmath41 is less than one .",
    "therefore , all the mass clumps considered here have low surface mass densities , and are all sub - critical in the lensing sense , @xmath42 . here",
    ", @xmath43 is the critical surface mass density for lensing , and @xmath44 s are the angular diameter distances between the source , lens , and observer .",
    "strong lensing is unimportant on such scales .",
    "moreover , weak lensing is quite weak indeed ; therefore it is sufficient to approximate magnification @xmath45 of a lens with @xmath46 , by @xmath47 .",
    "we will now evaluate the expected rates of grbs , @xmath29 , @xmath26 , and @xmath30 . assuming the production of grbs traces luminous matter , the clump will generate grbs at a rate proportional to @xmath48 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are its mass and mass to light ratio .",
    "the rate of bursts is then given by , @xmath51 the time dilation term , @xmath52 , is due to the reduced rate of grbs originating at cosmological redshifts . the physical surface density of a density inhomogeneity increases as @xmath53 .",
    "later , we will need to express @xmath34 in terms of its angular size , and distance , @xmath54 .",
    "the small angle approximation , assumed here , is valid for angles up to a few tens of degrees .",
    "the angular correlation function of grbs on scales larger than that is probably not relevant .",
    "thus , small angle approximation used here , and also in equations ( 3)-(5 ) below , is valid for our purposes .",
    "similarly , in the tube , the rate of bursts is also proportional to the density of luminous matter , @xmath55 . here ,",
    "@xmath56 and @xmath57 are the average density and mass to light ratio of the universe , and @xmath58 is the volume of the tube .",
    "the rate of grbs from the tube is given by , @xmath59 ^ 2{{cdt}\\over{dz}}(1+z)^3 ( 1+z)^{-1 } dz,\\eqno(3)\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the angular diameter distance , and @xmath61(@xmath19=0 ) is the present day average mass density of the universe .",
    "weak lensing due to a density inhomogeneity will have two effects on the observed sources : ( 1 ) it will extend the redshift of the visible grbs beyond @xmath22 , to @xmath62 ; and ( 2 ) it will dilute the surface density of the bursts located beyond @xmath28 .",
    "thus , including lensing effects , the rate of grbs from the tube is given by , @xmath63 ^ 2{{cdt}\\over{dz}}(1+z)^2 dz   + \\int_{z_l}^{z_{max}^\\prime } [ \\theta d(z)]^2{{cdt}\\over{dz}}(1+z)^2 { 1\\over{a(z_l , z ) } } dz\\biggr ] .",

    "the minimum observable ( unlensed ) flux is reduced to @xmath66 .",
    "the fractional change in flux is then @xmath67 , and since @xmath68 , the redshift change is @xmath69 where @xmath70 , and ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)=(1 , 0 ) cosmology is assumed . with",
    "weak lensing , maximum redshift of observed bursts is @xmath71 . for @xmath0 , and @xmath72 between 0.5 and 1.5 ,",
    "@xmath73 is of the order of 1 .",
    "now let us examine the effects of weak lensing due a single clump at @xmath28 , on the observed rate of grbs seen in a given direction .",
    "an interesting quantity to consider is the ratio of the change in the number of bursts due to lensing to the number of bursts due to the clump itself , @xmath74 . making use of equations ( 2)-(6 ) we get , @xmath75 @xmath76.\\eqno(7)\\ ] ] the two terms in equation ( 7 ) represent additional sources due to fainter observable fluxes , and the deficit in the source number density due to the dilution effects of lensing , respectively .",
    "ratio @xmath77 can be either positive or negative depending on which of the two terms in equation ( 7 ) dominates .",
    "in general , area dilution term dominates if the column of matter between the lens and the edge of the source population is large .",
    "@xmath77 is independent of @xmath36 , @xmath25 , and @xmath37 , as long as lensing is weak .",
    "in fact , it only depends on cosmology through @xmath44 s , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 s , and weakly , on @xmath72 , the spectral index of grbs .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath77 as a function of log  @xmath28 , for ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)=(1 , 0 ) .",
    "there are five solid curves ; from the top they are for @xmath800.5 , 0.2 , 0.7 , 1.0 , and 1.5 .",
    "these curves assume @xmath81 , the density inhomogeneities on relevant scales , @xmath82mpc , have a biasing factor @xmath83 .",
    "the long - dash and short - dash curves are for @xmath801.0 , and @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively .",
    "since @xmath77 is simply proportional to @xmath86 , the rest of the @xmath22 cases with @xmath87 are not shown on the plot to avoid crowding .",
    "the actual value of @xmath88 is probably somewhere between 0.5 and 2 , and depends on the type of galaxies that are used to delineate the density inhomogeneities .",
    "for example , the biasing factor for iras galaxies is probably around 0.7 , while optical galaxies have a larger @xmath88 ( see dekel 1993 , strauss 1992 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath77 changes very rapidly as redshift @xmath28 decreases ( figure 1 is a log - linear plot ) .",
    "in fact , the analytical expression in equation ( 7 ) diverges as @xmath89 , as @xmath28 approaches 0 .",
    "physically , the quantity @xmath77 loses its meaning as @xmath28 gets very small  since the expected number of bursts is well below 1 .",
    "figure 1 implies that weak lensing by the nearby cosmological structures has a non - negligible effect ( @xmath90 of the order of 1 ) on the distribution of grbs of all fluxes .",
    "for example , if @xmath91 , the excess of bright bursts due to the cosmological structures at @xmath92 ( log  @xmath93 ) will be almost exactly offset by the deficit of fainter bursts . in other words ,",
    "if grbs of all fluxes are considered , there will be no net change of the burst rate due to structures at @xmath92 .",
    "of course , with the present numbers of bursts in the batse catalog ( @xmath94 ) , and the fraction of bursts originating at @xmath95 ( @xmath96 ) , one would not expect to see either these structures , or their lensing effects .    to gauge the overall importance of weak lensing , one needs to consider lenses at all redshifts up to @xmath22 .",
    "since @xmath77 is independent of the particulars of cosmological density inhomogeneities , a rough estimate of the average value of @xmath77 is its volume weighted average , @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the comoving volume element .",
    "figure 2 shows the dependence of @xmath99 , expressed as a percentage , on the effective depth of the observed grb population , @xmath22 , for three different sets of cosmological parameters : ( @xmath4 , @xmath5)=(0.2 , 0.8 ) , ( 0.2 , 0 ) , and ( 1 , 0 ) .",
    "as expected , a @xmath5 dominated universe shows the largest change due to lensing .",
    "volume weighted @xmath99 is strongly dominated by the positive @xmath100 s at @xmath101 , for all values of @xmath22 and all sets of ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "this means that weak lensing will enhance the contrast of individual density inhomogeneities by @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the observed angular correlation function of _ all _ bursts will be increased by @xmath99 on _ all _ angular scales .",
    "given that the present day limits on @xmath102 of grbs are rather weak , an increase of @xmath103 would not be detected , especially if the observed grbs extend to large redshifts , @xmath104 .",
    "in this paper we examined the effect of weak lensing on the angular distribution of grbs .",
    "since the nature of and distance to grbs is unknown , a set of assumptions about the grb population had to be adopted ( see section 2.1 ) .",
    "these assumptions are common to most models of grbs currently discussed in the literature . in particular , all the bursts are considered to be at cosmological distances , and associated with luminous matter .",
    "another assumption crucial to the current discussion is that grbs are standard candles , or at least have a narrow intrinsic luminosity function .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows .",
    "the dominant effect of weak lensing is to extend the faint flux cutoff of the observed bursts .",
    "this wins over the area dilution effects of lensing , and hence leads to an enhancement of the density contrast of cosmological structures , as seen in the distribution of bursts of all fluxes .",
    "the amplitude of the enhancement depends on the depth of the present grb catalogs , the cosmological model adopted , and the biasing factor , @xmath88 on scales @xmath105 mpc .",
    "the amplitude is insensitive to the mass profile of density inhomogeneities , @xmath36 , their absolute mass density normalization , @xmath37 , and the angular scale of observations , @xmath25 .",
    "it is slightly sensitive to the assumed spectral index of grbs , @xmath72 .",
    "the overall importance of weak lensing is summarized in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath99 can be roughly interpreted as the change in the amplitude of the angular correlation function of grbs . for a canonical set of assumptions , @xmath91 and @xmath106 , @xmath107=(1 , 0 ) , @xmath102",
    "is expected to be increased by @xmath2 on all angular scales .",
    "such a change will not be detected given the present numbers of cataloged bursts .",
    "recently , it was suggested by lamb and quashnock ( 1993 ) that if grbs trace luminous matter , their distribution on @xmath108 scales can be used to probe the large scale structure in the universe .",
    "the authors estimate that if @xmath109 grbs are observed , these would provide the power spectrum of density fluctuations on scales currently probed by pencil beam surveys and superclusters .",
    "density fluctuations on such scales are probably primordial in nature and may be compared to those implied by the cobe observations of microwave background .",
    "if , after a few more years of batse observations , the accumulated number of bursts makes such an investigation possible , then weak lensing effects should be taken into account .",
    "since the weak lensing scenario described in this paper seems to be rather general , one may wonder if it applies to populations of other extragalactic objects seen in projection , for example , galaxies .",
    "the answer is no . here , grbs are treated as standard candles .",
    "galaxies , on the other hand , have a broad distribution of intrinsic luminosities .",
    "in fact , a typical @xmath110log  @xmath111/@xmath112 slope for galaxies , 0.4 ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ) , leads to no net change in the surface number density of a lensed population , hence the angular correlation function of galaxies will not be affected by weak lensing in this case .",
