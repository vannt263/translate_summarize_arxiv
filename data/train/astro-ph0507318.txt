    "since the discovery of the presently accelereted expansion of the universe from supernovae observations @xcite@xcite , evidences for such an accelerated phase are increasing . the simplest theoretical candidate to explain this acceleration is a cosmological constant @xmath0 .",
    "anything producing sufficient negative pressure - for instance a scalar field @xcite or a bulk viscosity @xcite - could also be valid .    before the discovery of this acceleration , phenomenological ansatze with a variable @xmath7 were tentatively proposed as solutions of the cosmological  constant \" problem . for instance , laws such as @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite7 , where @xmath10 is the scale factor of the flrw space - time , @xmath11@xcite or @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the hubble parameter and @xmath14 is its exponential inflation value , were suggested .",
    "other proposals @xcite@xcite can also be quoted .    from a different point of view ,",
    "the generalization @xcite @xcite of the black hole and of the de sitter event - horizon thermodynamics @xcite to the flrw space - time has led to the relation @xmath15",
    "@xmath16 @xcite where @xmath2 denotes the event - horizon in the flrw model of the universe .",
    "recently , this last form for @xmath7 , or , equivalently , for the dark energy density @xmath17 through @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) , has received further confirmations based on the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "let us remind of the approach which can been followed to produce a model with a time - dependent cosmological constant .",
    "we start with a type - like perfect fluid energy - momentum tensor    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is the 4-velocity common to all the components of the energy density @xmath22 .",
    "we consider two components such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the component ( @xmath25 , @xmath26 ) is the matter with the barotropic state equation @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a constant ( for instance , @xmath29 for dust ) .",
    "the second component is the dark energy ( de ) with @xmath30 , the vacuum energy density , and @xmath31 the ( negative ) pressure satisfying the state equation@xmath32    relation ( 2 ) leads to the two following alternatives :    * each component is conserved separately and , of course , @xmath0 has to be constant . *",
    "both of the components are conserved together , @xmath33 is then possible .",
    "the event - horizon thermodynamics ( eht ) model is derived on the basis of point ii ) by assuming an interaction between the matter and the dark energy ( de hereafter ) .",
    "let us remark that we write matter \" for any sort of matter except de .",
    "today , the matter is the dust , the largest part of which is the dark matter ( dm ) .",
    "for sake of simplicity , we use dm to denote the dust , encompassing the baryonic matter . in the same vein ,",
    "other models assuming an interaction between the de and dm components of the cosmic fluid were studied , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a model such that @xmath34 for the de density can be used in different ways and different contexts .",
    "for instance , in a precedent paper @xcite in order to address the problem of the exit of inflation in the early universe , we imposed as second component a perfect fluid of strings ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the model led then to @xmath36 , which was independently considered as an anstz derived by dimensional considerations by some authors @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "an equivalence can be found between the previous relation @xmath37 and the forms @xmath38 and @xmath39 under specific conditions @xcite .    in the present paper , in order to settle some issues on the coincidence and the recent decceleration - acceleration transition problems , we assume for the second component a cold dark matter ( @xmath40 ) . in section 2",
    "we review some basic equations and relations common to the eht and lhg models .",
    "the eht model is developed in section 3 , particularly for the @xmath41 epoch . in section 4 , in order to probe the de assumption in this range of @xmath42 , we discuss how our model fits in with the type ia supernovae observations 23 .",
    "we deduce then the most likely values for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 parameters , as well as the decceleration parameter @xmath45 and the decceleration - acceleration transition redshift @xmath46 . finally , sections 5 and 6 contain comments and a brief comparative discussion concerning the results obtained by the two models .",
    "in order to set the notations , we introduce some basic equations of the two component models .",
    "the spatially flat flrw space - time has the metric@xmath47   \\label{eq3}\\]]where the scale factor @xmath10 is a monotonic increasing function of the cosmic time @xmath48 .",
    "we assume an universe filled by two interacting type - like perfect fluids , namely dust ( ordinary and dark matter ) and dark energy ( de ) .",
    "the dust and de energy densities are @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively , and their corresponding pressures are @xmath26 and @xmath31 .",
    "the two state equations are @xmath51 with @xmath52 @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , where @xmath55 can be variable .",
    "we recall the field equations for the spatially flat case @xmath56",
    "@xmath57    where @xmath58 is the hubble parameter , @xmath59 the velocity of the light and the dot stands for the time derivative .    combining these two equations leads to @xmath60 where the dimensionless density parameter @xmath61 has been introduced .",
    "the equation ( 6 ) is always valid provided the de is a perfect fluid .",
    "we consider now @xmath0 as a vacuum energy density associated to the flrw event - horizon such as @xmath62where @xmath2 is the proper radius of the event - horizon , and @xmath63 is a dimensionless constant parameter .",
    "this form of @xmath0 was previously obtained by @xcite and @xcite when @xmath64 , and by @xcite when @xmath65 .",
    "using the quantity @xmath66 , relation ( [ eq7 ] ) becomes @xmath67the proper radius of the flat flrw event - horizon is @xmath68the derivative of ( [ eq9 ] ) with respect to time gives @xmath69for convenience , we introduce the variable @xmath70 such as @xmath71 today .",
    "relation ( [ eq10 ] ) becomes then @xmath72where the prime means the derivative with respect to @xmath73 .    in the same manner , we can rewrite relation ( [ eq6 ] ) @xmath74finally , by combining equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) with the derivative of equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , one obtains @xmath75 - 2[1-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\omega _ { \\lambda } } } { \\alpha } ] \\}%",

    "we assume that the matter \" component @xmath25 is dust ( @xmath29 ) , so that ( [ eq13 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) become @xmath78@xmath79the relations ( [ eq3])-([eq16 ] ) are valid in the two models under consideration , which we denote @xmath80 models hereafter .    from now on , the assumptions of the ehtmodel will be different from the lhg model s ones .",
    "we assume that the de component satisfies thermodynamical state equations , i.e. relations between its thermodynamical variables which are valid in any space - time .",
    "therefore , any thermodynamical state equation valid in the de sitter s space - time @xcite@xcite - for instance , @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( @xmath83 the temperature ) - remains valid in the flrw space - time .",
    "thus , if the de is an actual cosmological component , its thermodynamical state equations will stay the same , independently on the choice of the space - time as well as for any other component .",
    "this suggests to retain the relation ( [ eq7 ] ) which is valid in the de sitter s space - time when @xmath84 . in section 5 ,",
    "some consequences of the presence of the parameter @xmath63 in the eht and lhg models are discussed .",
    "using the holographic principle can lead also to choose the relation ( [ eq7 ] ) @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these references assume a variable state equation ( @xmath85 ) for the de , and independent energy conservation laws for the matter and de components .",
    "conversely , the present model assumes @xmath86 ( vacuum ) , and that the energy conservation is only valid for the two components considered together .",
    "equation ( [ eq15 ] ) can be rewritten @xmath87where the constants @xmath88and @xmath89 are given by@xmath90by setting @xmath64 , equation ( 17 ) becomes @xmath91which differs from equation ( [ eq8 ] ) in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless a straightforward calculation ( using ( [ eq12]),([eq15 ] ) and the derivative of the definition of @xmath66 ) gives @xmath92which is common to the two models .",
    "as @xmath93 is always negative , @xmath0 is decreasing with time .",
    "observational evidences provide a very small present value for @xmath30 ( fine - tuning problem ) and of the same order as @xmath49 ( coincidence problem ) .    introducing the function @xmath94 @xmath95 , relation ( [ eq17 ] )",
    "becomes@xmath96its solution is ( in the only case considered here where @xmath97 ) @xmath98@xmath99 is a constant of integration which can be related to the initial condition @xmath100 .",
    "we derive now the expression of @xmath101 . using equations ( [ eq11 ] ) and ( [ eq21 ] ) yields@xmath102after integration , one obtains @xmath103or equivalently @xmath104@xmath105 is a second constant of integration which depends on @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",

    ", it yields @xmath119=\\frac{c(1+z)}{y_{0}h_{0}}[(1+z)\\frac{r}{r_{0}}-1 ] , \\label{eq28}\\]]where the expression of @xmath2 depends on @xmath42 . as before",
    ", we only consider the case @xmath64 . both equations ( [ eq22 ] ) et ( [ eq25 ] ) give a parametric representation ( via the parameter \" @xmath120 ) of @xmath2 as function of @xmath42 .",

    "the set of the theoretical curves  distance moduli \" @xmath123 versus the redshift @xmath42 , @xmath124 predicted by the model parametrized by the two cosmological parameters @xmath125 et @xmath43 , can be plotted .",

    "the corresponding values of @xmath109 and @xmath43 are derived by numerical computation .",
    "more precisely , equation ( [ eq21 ] ) is integrated by the method of runge - kutta of order 4 , and the expression of @xmath129 is deduced by use of ( [ eq22 ] ) . with the help of equations ( [ eq28 ] ) and ( [ eq29 ] ) , the values of @xmath130 for @xmath42 ranging from 0 to 100",
    "are then obtained . after a simple numerical evaluation of @xmath131 for @xmath44 ranging from @xmath132 to @xmath133 and @xmath43 from @xmath134 to @xmath135 ,",

    "today the decceleration is @xmath5 , and the decceleration - acceleration transition occured at @xmath6 .     of the ehtmodel , width=252,height=221 ]",
    "we examine here the influence of the parameter @xmath63 on the limits of the proper radius @xmath2 of the event horizon ( eh ) in the two models .",
    "first , let us consider the lhg model .    by comparison with the relations ( [ eq22 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) of the eht model",
    ", the lhg model would lead to the relations ( @xmath148 is given by ( 9 ) of @xcite and @xmath149 , not explicitly given , can be deduced from their eqs .",
    "( 6 ) and ( 9 ) ) : @xmath150@xmath151for @xmath152 , the lhg model requires to start again the calculation from the differential equation ( [ eq15 ] ) which becomes:@xmath153its integration yields@xmath154then , @xmath155we can see from ( [ eq32 ] ) or ( [ eq35 ] ) that @xmath148 tends to infinity when @xmath120 tends to @xmath133 , for any values of @xmath63 ( positive , see ( 8) ) .",
    "but the behaviour of @xmath2 differs because it depends on the parameter @xmath63 , as it can be seen from ( 32 ) and ( 35 ) .",
    "three cases can be distinguished for the behaviour of @xmath2 in the limit @xmath156 : @xmath157@xmath158@xmath159the first two cases ( i.e. @xmath160 and @xmath161 ) disagree with the holographic point of view , because they would prevent any cut - off ( ir and uv respectively ) .",
    "in particular , the case @xmath162 seems to be proscribed because it could not prevent the singularity formation and would correspond to the absence of black hole formation .",
    "the third case only ( @xmath64 ) corresponds to a de sitter asymptotic limit . in equation ( [ eq38 ] ) , the index @xmath163 of @xmath164 means exponential  inflation \" .",
    "note that the limit @xmath165 depends only on @xmath166 , and its value is : @xmath167 if we take @xmath168 . as @xmath169 , @xmath170 is equal to @xmath171 .",
    "the expression of @xmath172 is formally the same in the two models and depends only on the choice of the observationnal priors @xmath43 et @xmath173 .",
    "however , each model leading to slightly different adjustments of these parameters gives slightly different values of @xmath172 and @xmath174 then .    in the case of the eht model , for any arbitrary @xmath63 , the same phenomenon appears and the value @xmath152 does not necessitate a special study . in the limit @xmath156 , equations ( [ eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq27 ] ) give@xmath175@xmath176when @xmath177 , @xmath89 @xmath178 , then @xmath179 before reaching @xmath133 , and @xmath180 , while @xmath181 for this asymptotical limit @xmath89 of @xmath120 . from the today observational evaluations , @xmath89 has to be @xmath182 , and so @xmath63 @xmath183 . in the future , @xmath184 range from @xmath133 to @xmath185 will become more and more narrow , tending to @xmath133 , as long as the equation ( 17 ) of the model , indicating a growth of @xmath186 , remains valid .",
    "thus , the case @xmath64 appears to us as the most attractive .",
    "the corresponding de sitter s limit is @xmath187 .",
    "it is a little greater than the limit of the lhg model ( @xmath171 ) , which means a little weaker exponential inflation .",
    "we have seen that the form @xmath34 , clearly supported by the holographic principle , leads , in our study , to two somewhat different models , owing to the chosen energy conservation equation . in the eht model , @xmath84 and",
    "the best fit ( @xmath188 ) to the snia s data from the  gold \" sample @xcite gives us @xmath189 @xmath190 and @xmath191 . if @xmath192 ( as in the lhg model ) it is worth observing that the @xmath162 values are not very attractive because they lead to the singularity @xmath160 when @xmath193 .",
    "for the decceleration - acceleration transition epoch we find a redshift @xmath194 , a value slightly higher than the ones recently published ( @xmath195)@xcite @xcite and very sensitive to the @xmath109 value .",
    "comparing the values of the cosmological parameters in various models requires to discuss not only the choice of the parameter @xmath63 but also the forms or relations taken for @xmath146 ( for instance , @xmath196 valid when @xmath197 ) , for @xmath198 , or for @xmath199 .",
    "besides , in a given model , one has to take into account the energy conservation laws for dm and de .  in most cases ,",
    "the authors assume an energy conservation law for each component separately . here",
    "we have considered the more  general situation of a global conservation of the whole energy and , necessarily , an interaction between dm and de .",
    "such an interaction could induce higher values for the transition redshift @xmath46 , as noted by amendola et al . for models with coupling @xcite .",
    "future observations in the high redshift range could allow to discriminate between theories with coupled components and theories with distinct conservation laws ."
