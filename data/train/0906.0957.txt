    "[ [ section ] ]    the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite with r - parity can solve the hierarchy problem and provide a candidate dark matter ( dm ) particle .",
    "the absence of observed supersymmetric ( susy ) particles in collider experiments to date implies that if nature is ever supersymmetric then it must be broken . the source of susy breaking is a priori unknown in a bottom - up approach to particle physics phenomenology . as spontaneous susy breaking in the mssm",
    "is not viable  @xcite , one is led to consider susy breaking in a hidden sector of the theory communicated via a messenger sector to the mssm .",
    "the choice of messenger sector leaves an imprint on the pattern of susy breaking , and therefore on the expected susy phenomenology .",
    "there are currently many viable soft - susy breaking schemes with some common mediation mechanisms including gauge , gravity , anomaly and moduli mediation .",
    "there are examples of each class of model which only have a few parameters and can be somewhat constrained by current cosmological and indirect collider data .",
    "sparticles appear in loop contributions to electroweak and @xmath3-physics observables , affecting their values indirectly . in this paper",
    ", we ask the question : is there sufficient power in such combined data to favour one simple model over the other ?",
    "such model selection is likely to become even more interesting and important if signals compatible with susy are found in the large hadron collider ( lhc ) experiments .    to date",
    ", global bayesian fits have been performed to the constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite , large volume string compactification models ( lvs )  @xcite , the phenomenological mssm ( pmssm )  @xcite and the non - universal higgs model  @xcite . in any bayesian fit",
    "it is essential to check for robustness by choosing widely different but reasonable prior distributions of the model parameters . for models with more parameters",
    "the prior dependence becomes greater , but more precise and direct data will reduce such dependence . the pmssm has _",
    "twenty _ extra - standard model ( sm ) parameters and displays a large prior - dependence in the fit results .",
    "even the cmssm , with only _ four _ extra - sm parameters , shows significant prior dependence and so many aspects of the fits are not robust .",
    "the parameter - space fits of the cmssm and the pmssm could only be robust with strong enough direct and precise data . the lvs fit , which has _ two _ extra - sm parameters , shows approximate prior independence  @xcite .",
    "here , we shall perform fits to two additional models : minimal anomaly mediated susy breaking ( mamsb ) and minimal gauge mediated susy breaking ( mgmsb ) , each of which have the intermediate number of _ three _ parameters .",
    "thus , we ask if the current available data are powerful enough to robustly constrain these models with three parameters additional to the sm as well as ask if it is powerful enough to disfavour any of the models over the others .",
    "the mssm also contains a @xmath0 parameter in the higgs superpotential , whose magnitude is constrained by the @xmath4 boson mass but whose sign is unknown . in the past",
    ", mssm bayesian model selection has only focused on the extent to which @xmath5 is favoured over @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "thus , our work extends the use of bayesian model selection to cover different susy breaking scenarios .    aside from the bayesian fits ,",
    "there have also been some global profile likelihood ( equivalent to minimizing @xmath7 ) analyses of the cmssm  @xcite .",
    "prior dependence does not appear in frequentist interpretations of fits and so one can not be sure whether they are robust .",
    "the bayesian analyses indicate that such fits are not yet robust with current data . a recent @xmath7 analysis  @xcite compared the cmssm , mgmsb and mamsb using electroweak and @xmath3-physics observables while omitting the dark matter constraint .",
    "the analysis found that mamsb was slightly preferred over the two other models by @xmath8 and that light susy was slightly favoured by each model .",
    "we extend this work in several ways , the most important being that we include dark matter as a constraint .",
    "we shall show that the dark matter constraint contains more information content than the other observables . by performing a bayesian fit with several priors we are able to check robustness of the fit , and , unlike ref .",
    "@xcite , we incorporate the uncertainties of important sm parameters into our fit .",
    "the parameters of the cmssm are a flavour blind susy breaking scalar mass @xmath9 , a common gaugino mass @xmath10 , a flavour blind susy breaking scalar trilinear coupling @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the ratio of the mssm higgs vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) . below a grand unification theory ( gut )",
    "scale of @xmath13 gev , the susy breaking terms of different flavours evolve separately to the weak scale . in anomaly",
    "mediated susy breaking ( amsb ) @xcite susy - breaking is communicated to the visible sector via the super - weyl anomaly . in its original manifestation ,",
    "pure anomaly mediation suffers from negative slepton mass squared parameters , signalling a scalar potential minimum inconsistent with a massless photon .",
    "minimal amsb ( mamsb ) assumes the existence of an additional contribution to scalar masses @xmath9 at @xmath14 giving it a total of three parameters : the vev of the auxiliary field in the supergravity multiplet representing the overall sparticles mass scale , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "as advertised above , minimal gauge mediated susy breaking ( mgmsb )  @xcite also has three continuous parameters : the overall messenger mass scale , @xmath18 , a visible sector soft susy - breaking mass scale , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "it also contains an additional discrete parameter , namely @xmath21 , the number of su(5 ) @xmath22 representations of mediating fields .",
    "the example of a moduli mediated model which we consider is the large volume scenario ( lvs ) derived in the context of @xmath23 flux compactification  @xcite , whose two extra - sm parameters are an overall susy breaking mass scale @xmath24 and @xmath12 .    the cmssm is the phenomenologically most studied model in the literature , and so it is useful as a benchmark as to how well other models fare in the fits .",
    "it is not clear without further model building how the gut - scale flavour blind structure of the cmssm emerges , however .",
    "the main motivation for mamsb and mgmsb is that the flavour problem is solved , since gauge interactions in mgmsb necessarily lead to flavour blind soft terms  @xcite at the messenger scale , and the mamsb soft - terms are dominated by flavour diagonal pieces proportional to the gauge couplings  @xcite .",
    "the main motivation for lvs is that it results from a string compactification scenario which has moduli stabilization .    the rest of the paper proceeds as follows : in section  [ sec : analysis ] we show the technical aspects of our analysis , including a discussion of model parameters , prior probability distribution functions ( pdfs ) , observables and the calculation of the likelihood .",
    "section  [ sec : results : model_compar ] presents an analysis of susy breaking model selection including the bayesian evidence results on the preference for the sign of @xmath0 , the model selection and the dependence of our results on the dark matter constraint .",
    "sections  [ sec : fitgmsb ] and  [ sec : fitamsb ] detail the phenomenologically viable regions of the parameter spaces of mgmsb and mamsb , while section  [ sec : con ] discusses the effects of individual observables and presents the best - fit points obtained , concluding with a discussion of the interplay between the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the rare branching ratio @xmath25 in the different models .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our fits for the direct detection of dark matter in appendix  [ sec : dm ] .      problems in data analysis generally divide into two categories : parameter estimation and model selection . in parameter estimation problems",
    "one is interested in making inferences about the parameters of a given model using the available data and any other prior information .",
    "model selection problems are concerned with distinguishing between different theories describing a given phenomenon .",
    "for instance , in the case of the cmssm , one would like to know whether there is sufficient evidence in the data to rule out the @xmath6 branch .",
    "bayesian inference provides a consistent approach to model selection as well as to the estimation of a set of parameters @xmath26 in a model ( or hypothesis ) @xmath27 for the data @xmath28 .",
    "it can also be shown that bayesian inference is the unique consistent generalisation of the boolean algebra  @xcite .    assuming some model hypothesis @xmath27 , bayesian statistics helps update some pdf @xmath29 of model parameters @xmath30 with data .",
    "the prior encodes our knowledge or prejudices about the parameters . since @xmath29 is a pdf in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , which defines a normalization of the prior .",
    "one talks of priors being ` flat ' in some parameters , but care must be taken to refer to the measure of such parameters .",
    "a prior that is flat between some ranges in a parameter @xmath32 will not be flat in a parameter @xmath33 , for example .",
    "the impact of the data is encoded in the likelihood , or the pdf of obtaining data set @xmath34 from model point @xmath30 : @xmath35 .",
    "the likelihood is a function of @xmath7 , i.e.  a statistical measure of how well the data are fit by the model point .",
    "the desired quantity is the pdf of the model parameters @xmath26 given some observed data @xmath34 assuming hypothesis @xmath27 : @xmath36 .",
    "bayes theorem states that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the bayesian evidence , the probability density of observing data set @xmath28 integrated over all model parameter space . the bayesian evidence is given by : @xmath39 where the integral is over @xmath40 dimensions of the parameter space @xmath30 . since the bayesian evidence is independent of the model parameter values @xmath30 , it is usually ignored in parameter estimation problems and posterior inferences are obtained by exploring the unnormalized posterior using standard markov chain monte carlo sampling methods .    in order to select between two models @xmath41 and @xmath42",
    "one needs to compare their respective posterior probabilities given the observed data set @xmath34 , as follows : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the prior probability ratio for the two models , which can often be set to unity but occasionally requires further consideration ( see e.g. @xcite for cases where the prior probability ratios should not be set to unity ) .",
    "it can be seen from eq .",
    "[ eq:3.1 ] that bayesian model selection revolves around the evaluation of the bayesian evidence . as the average of likelihood over the prior , the evidence automatically implements occam s razor .",
    "a theory with less parameters has a higher prior density since it integrates to 1 over the whole space .",
    "thus , there is an a priori preference for less parameters , unless the data strongly require there be more .",
    "unfortunately , evaluation of bayesian evidence involves the multi - dimensional integral in eq .",
    "[ eq:3 ] and thus presents a challenging numerical task .",
    "standard techniques like thermodynamic integration @xcite are extremely computationally expensive which makes evidence evaluation typically at least an order of magnitude more costly than parameter estimation .",
    "some fast approximate methods have been used for evidence evaluation , such as treating the posterior as a multi - variate gaussian centered at its peak ( see e.g. @xcite ) , but this approximation is clearly a poor one for highly non - gaussian and multi  modal posteriors , such as those we sample here .",
    "bridge sampling  @xcite allows the evaluation of the ratio of bayesian evidence of two models , but can yield rather imprecise results .",
    "the problem can however be tackled by bank sampling @xcite , but it is not yet clear how precisely bank sampling can calculate the evidence ratio .",
    "various alternative information criteria for model selection are discussed by @xcite , but the evidence remains our preferred method .",
    "the nested sampling approach , introduced in @xcite , is a monte carlo method targeted at the efficient calculation of the evidence , but also produces posterior inferences as a by  product .",
    "@xcite built on this nested sampling framework and introduced the multinest algorithm which is efficient in sampling from multi ",
    "modal posteriors that exhibit curving degeneracies .",
    "multinest produces posterior samples and calculates the evidence and its uncertainty .",
    "this technique has greatly reduced the computational cost of model selection and the exploration of highly degenerate multi  modal posterior distributions .",
    "we employ this technique in this paper .",
    "the natural logarithm of the ratio of posterior model probabilities provides a useful guide to what constitutes a significant difference between two models : @xmath45 = \\log \\left [ \\frac{\\mathcal{z}_1}{\\mathcal{z}_0}\\frac{p(h_{1})}{p(h_{0})}\\right ] .",

    "however , @xmath49physics constraints dominated by @xmath50 , electroweak constraints , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon and the higgs mass constraint all play significant roles too . by contrast ,",

    "we ask the question : are any of the most commonly assumed low - parameter susy breaking mediation mechanisms favored over the others by current indirect and cosmological data ? aside from direct searches , susy corrections contribute to the observables we consider only in loop effects . for observables that agree with the standard model prediction ,",
    "arbitrarily heavy sparticles suppress such loop effects and so will fit that observable .",
    "however , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon prefers a significant contribution from supersymmetric loops , and so this observable prefers light susy particles .",
    "the dark matter constraint from cosmological observations can not be accounted for by the standard model , but can be fitted by the mssm if the lightest supersymmetric particle is the neutralino .",
    "we argue that the bayesian evidence is the relevant statistical quantity for such an analysis .    when performing such a statistical global fit , it is important to check robustness .",
    "the fits should be dominated by the data and not by the form of the prior if we are to claim robustness .",
    "previous studies showed that fits to the cmssm with four extra parameters are prior dependent  @xcite , whereas the lvs model  @xcite ( with only two extra parameters ) is more robust .",
    "thus it was natural to select mgmsb and mamsb , each of which have three extra parameters to check robustness of the fits and compare the models against each other .",
    "one expects the level of robustness to go down with higher numbers of parameters , which a recent fit to the phenomenological mssm  @xcite with twenty extra parameters , illustrated .",
    "we have presented constraints on the mgmsb and mamsb parameter spaces , and found that in both cases there _ is _ significant prior dependence .",
    "parameter inference from the models are therefore not robust and therefore require further more precise and direct data , perhaps from collider measurements of susy particles",
    ". unsurprisingly , no robust statement regarding the sign of @xmath0 can be made for mamsb or mgmsb .",
    "we therefore encourage that future work on mamsb and mgmsb include both signs of @xmath0 until the data is strong enough to support a prior - independent pronouncement on the status of the sign of @xmath0 , and not to disregard the @xmath6 branch of the theory based on the preference of one observable for @xmath5 . the large volume scenario , with two fewer parameters than the cmssm is more constrained and shows a robust moderate preference for @xmath5 .",
    "the model preferred by the data depends on what we assume for the dm relic density : whether it is made entirely of neutralinos ( symmetric constraint ) or whether we allow for the presence of non - neutralino dark matter ( asymmetric constraint ) .",
    "an analysis of the constraining power of the various observables showed that it resides dominantly in the dm constraint in the case of the cmssm and the lvs .",
    "this is not the case in mamsb where the relic density is uniformly too small by an order of magnitude across parameter space , and the main constraint comes from the combined electroweak observables . dropping the dm constraint",
    "altogether allows a comparison with mgmsb , but then no strong robust preference for any model can be found .",
    "however , for the symmetric constraint , mamsb is strongly disfavoured ( since it predicts essentially no neutralino dark matter ) over the cmssm and lvs . with the asymmetric constraint ,",
    "mamsb is at least moderately favoured over the cmssm .",
    "experience and familiarity with the methods of model selection and bayesian inference from work such as that contained here will be invaluable once further more constraining data become available , hopefully from susy signals at colliders .",

    "in this appendix we present results on dm direct detection cross - sections for the large volume scenario .",
    "direct detection rates in the cmssm have been most recently been presented in bayesian global fits in refs .",
    "our updated cmssm fits are similar to the results of those articles , so we do not include them here .",
    "our calculations of the detection cross - section have been obtained with ` micromegas2.3.1`@xcite .",
    "neutralinos are majorana fermions and can therefore interact with quarks via scalar and axial - vector interactions , but not via a vector - like interaction . in the scalar ( spin - independent )",
    "case , the neutralino can interact at tree - level with quarks in the nucleus via higgs or squark exchange . at one - loop",
    "the neutralino can couple to gluons via a quark / squark loop . at zero momentum transfer ,",
    "the total cross - section is given by @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the nucleon - neutralino reduced mass , @xmath4 and @xmath117 are the number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus and @xmath118 is the coupling of the neutralino to the proton(neutron ) respectively .",
    "the neutralino - quark axial - vector interaction leads to a spin - dependent coupling proportional to @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the spin of the nucleus .",
    "the cross - section is given by @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the relative velocity of the neutralino and @xmath123 is the scattering matrix element .",
    "this expression is then integrated over the boltzmann velocity distribution of the neutralinos to obtain an average cross section .",
    "since the results of our fits indicate that the lvs is sufficiently constrained so as to be independent of the prior , we show only the case of linear priors .",
    "the cross - sections are independent of whether the nucleon is a proton or neutron .",
    "we therefore have plotted the average @xmath124 for each point sampled . as elsewhere in this article",
    "we marginalize over the sign of @xmath0 .          fig .",
    "[ fig : dmdetection](a ) shows the 2d posterior pdf for the logarithm of the spin - independent cross - section per nucleon in picobarns against the neutralino mass @xmath125 .",
    "we also show the cdms  @xcite upper bound assuming the local dm density to be @xmath126 .",
    "[ fig : dmdetection](b ) shows the posterior pdf for the log of the spin - dependent cross - section per nucleon versus the neutralino mass .",
    "the dm detection cross - sections are both well below the bounds set by the current generation of dm searches such as cdms@xcite in the spin - independent and superk  @xcite in the spin - dependent cases .",
    "future one - tonne detectors should be able to probe the entire range of the lvs parameter space for the spin - independent cross - section down to @xmath127pb .",
    "the spin - dependent result is independent of the sign of @xmath0 giving a robust prediction of @xmath128pb .",
