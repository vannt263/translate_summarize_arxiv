    "the primary threat to continued downscaling of electronic devices envisaged in moore s law @xcite is the excessive energy dissipation that takes place in the device during switching .",
    "straintronic magneto - tunneling junctions ( s - mtj ) are among the most energy - efficient three - terminal resistance switches extant @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , they are also relatively error - prone @xcite and have low resistance on / off ratios .",
    "the switching error probability is typically larger than 10@xmath0 at room temperature @xcite which makes it problematic to utilize them in boolean logic .",
    "this has turned attention to non - boolean computing paradigms @xcite , which may be more forgiving of errors and do not always demand high resistance on / off ratios . here ,",
    "we explore one such application , namely ternary content - addressable memory ( tcam ) and show that replacing transistors with s - mtj results in significant energy saving and increased cell density .",
    "the low on / off ratio does not inhibit circuit operation , although a higher on / off ratio would be desirable .",
    "tcam is useful for high - speed parallel data processing .",
    "it finds application in platforms such as packet forwarding in network routers @xcite , image encoding @xcite , parametric curve extraction @xcite , and hough transformation @xcite .",
    "it compares input search data against a table of stored data to return the memory address of fully or partially matching data .",
    "each tcam cell has three states in its search and storage bit : ` 0 ' , ` 1 ' and ` x ' ( do nt care ) .",
    "the `` do nt care '' state allows masking , i.e. , a match regardless of the storage and/or search data bit .",
    "key challenges in a large scale tcam are to achieve a high cell density and low standby power dissipation .",
    "conventional cmos - based tcam cells consume large areas on a chip .",
    "although cmos scaling improves the cell density , the standby power dissipation deteriorates @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", an s - mtj based tcam can overcome these challenges and achieve a very high cell density along with little or no standby power dissipation .",
    "an s - mtj is a standard mtj ( fixed layer - spacer - free layer ) with one difference .",
    "the free layer is a magnetostrictive nanomagnet in elastic contact with an underlying poled piezoelectric thin film of thickness @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "square electrodes of edge @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , separated by a distance @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) , are delineated on the piezoelectric surrounding the mtj stack .",
    "the bottom of the conducting substrate is grounded .",
    "the electrode ` 1 ' is used to read the s - mtj resistance by passing a current to ground .",
    "application of a voltage across the piezoelectric film using the electrode pair ` 2 ' shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) generates biaxial strain in the film ( compresssion along the line joining the electrode pair and tension perpendicular to it , or vice versa , depending on the polarity of the voltage ) , which is partially or fully transferred to the soft layer of the s - mtj in elastic contact with the film .",
    "this rotates its magnetization via the villari effect @xcite and changes the s - mtj resistance , realizing the action of a switch . a tiny amount of voltage @xmath6 ( few mv ) is required to rotate the magnetization through a large angle and change the s - mtj resistance substantially if the piezoelectric film is @xmath7100 nm thick , resulting in a switching energy dissipation @xmath8 ( @xmath9 = capacitance associated with charging the piezoelectric , which is 1 - 2 ff ) of a few tens of aj @xcite . the internal energy dissipation within the magnetostrictive free layer due to gilbert damping is negligible @xcite .     between themselves.,width=345",
    "]    the s - mtj operation has been experimentally demonstrated @xcite . here , we first show that an s - mtj can be engineered to produce very unusual device characteristics and then show that such device characteristics elicit tcam behavior .",
    "consider a `` skewed '' s - mtj where the major axes of the fixed and free layers subtend an angle of 45@xmath10 between them as shown in fig .",
    "the fixed layer is implemented with a synthetic anti - ferromagnet ( saf ) to reduce the dipole interaction with the free layer , _ but not completely eliminate it_. because of shape anisotropy , the magnetization orientations of both layers will lie along the respective major axes of the ellipses , but owing to the remanent dipole interaction , the angle between them will be obtuse rather than acute ( see fig .",
    "when the free layer is strained by the voltage applied at the electrode pairs ` 2 ' , its magnetization begins to rotate .",
    "the remanent dipole interaction , will make it rotate _ clockwise _ in fig .",
    "1(b ) so as to always _ increase _ the angular separation between the magnetizations of the two layers .",
    "we have simulated the magnetization rotation under strain in the presence of thermal noise using stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( s - llg ) simulations ( see later description ) . out of 10@xmath11 switching trajectories",
    "simulated , not a single one rotated anti - clockwise , showing that the clockwise rotation is overwhelmingly preferred .",
    "strain can usually rotate magnetization by up to 90@xmath10 ( from the major to the minor axis of the ellipse ) although larger rotations are possible under special circumstances @xcite . initially , before the application of strain ,",
    "the magnetizations of the fixed and free layers subtend an angle @xmath12 = 135@xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "upon application of strain , the magnetization begins to rotate clockwise and @xmath12 gradually increases from 135@xmath10 to 225@xmath10 .",
    "the mtj resistance depends on @xmath12 according to @xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the mtj resistance when the magnetizations of the fixed and free layers are parallel ( anti - parallel ) , @xmath15 is the resistance when the angular separation between the magnetizations is @xmath12 , and @xmath16 . since @xmath12 varies between 135@xmath10 and 225@xmath10 , the conductance of the mtj ( or current flowing through terminal ` 1 ' at a fixed bias ) plotted as a function of the voltage applied at terminal ` 2 ' ( which generates the rotation ) will exhibit a `` valley '' .",
    "the bottom of the valley corresponds to @xmath17 when the mtj resistance becomes maximum .",
    "we can alter the stress distribution in the free layer of the s - mtj by applying an additional voltage across the piezoelectric with a third pair of electrodes ` 3 ' shown in fig .",
    "this will allow us to shift the position of the valley bottom in the transconductance characteristic @xmath18 versus @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the current through the @xmath21-th terminal at a fixed bias and @xmath22 is the voltage applied at the @xmath21-th terminal ) .",
    "thus , we have a 4-terminal switch with terminals ` 1 ' , ` 2 ' , ` 3 ' and ground , where the current between ` 1 ' and ground is changed with a voltage applied to ` 2 ' and the transfer characteristic associated with this change can be modulated with a voltage applied at terminal ` 3 ' .",
    "when both electrode pairs ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' are activated , the strain distribution in the piezoelectric ( and hence in the free layer of the s - mtj ) becomes complex .",
    "exact strain profiles can be calculated with three dimensional finite element analysis ( e.g. with comsol multiphysics package ) as in @xcite , but in order to keep the analysis tractable , we will assume that activating an electrode pair generates only uniaxial stress along the line joining that pair .",
    "note that if anything , this over - estimates the stress required to produce a given rotation @xmath12 , and is hence conservative .",
    "the sign of the uniaxial stress ( tensile or compressive ) depends on the polarity of the voltage .",
    "if we activate electrode pair ` 2 ' , then we will generate uniaxial stress along the major axis of the elliptical free layer of the s - mtj ( compressive or tensile depending on the voltage polarity at ` 2 ' ) , whereas if we activate electrode pair ` 3 ' we will generate uniaxial stress along the minor axis of the free layer .",
    "we have assumed that the free layer is made of terfenol - d which has a positive and large magnetostriction coefficient ( 900 ppm ) .",
    "compressive stress along any direction in the free layer will rotate its magnetization away from that direction ( maximum rotation is 90@xmath10 ) while tensile stress will keep it aligned along that direction .",
    "this allows us to control the angle @xmath12 with voltages at ` 2 ' and ` 3 ' .",
    "we have computed @xmath12 versus the voltage @xmath19 ( assuming @xmath23 = 0 ) at 0 k temperature ( no thermal noise ) using the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation which yields the magnetization orientation of the free layer as a function of time @xmath24 under the influence of voltage generated stress : @xmath25 ,   \\label{llg}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 is the saturation magnetization of the free layer material , @xmath27 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath28 is the gilbert damping constant in the free layer , and @xmath29 is the effective magnetic field experienced by the free layer at any time @xmath24 and is given by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the ( constant ) dipole field exerted by the fixed layer , @xmath32 is the field due to shape anisotropy , @xmath33 is the field generated by stress , and @xmath34 is the random field due to thermal noise .",
    "expressions for these fields are given in ref .",
    "stress is generated in the piezoelectric substrate by activating a shorted electrode pair with a voltage @xmath35 .",
    "the resulting stress is assumed to be uniaxial along the line joining the centers of the electrodes in the activated pair .",
    "the voltage @xmath35 generates a vertical electric field of @xmath36 in the piezoelectric substrate . following cui , et al .",
    "@xcite , we will assume that a vertical electric field of 37 kv / m is required to produce a uniaxial stress of 1 mpa in the substrate along the line joining the electrodes in the activated pair .",
    "this stress is assumed to be fully transferred to the soft magnetic layer of the mtj resting on top of the substrate .",
    "a negative voltage generates tensile stress and a positive voltage compressive stress because of the direction in which the piezoelectric film has been poled .",
    "equation ( [ llg ] ) is solved for various @xmath35-s until steady state is reached and that yields the orientation of the free layer s magnetization as a function of the @xmath35-s and hence @xmath12 versus @xmath19 for a fixed @xmath23 .",

    "note also that there is no significant difference between the 0 k and ( average of ) 300 k results .",
    "therefore , in the rest of this paper , we will present the 0 k results , _ noting that the 300 k results will not be significantly different_. in fig .",

    "4 , we plot the transfer characteristic @xmath18 versus @xmath19 at 0 k temperature for three different values of @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , the position of the notch can be shifted around with the voltage @xmath23 which generates an additional uniaxial stress ( negative voltage tensile and positive voltage compressive ) along the line joining the electrode pads ` 3 ' .",
    "this makes it a 4-terminal switch .",
    "in a skewed s - mtj , the current @xmath18 between the free and fixed layers can be controlled by the gate voltages at @xmath19 and @xmath23 [ fig . 4 ] . at any given value of @xmath42 , @xmath18 is lowest when @xmath19 and @xmath23 ` match ' , meaning that they obey the relation @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a fixed voltage that we call the ` offset voltage ' .",
    "the current @xmath18 increases steeply when @xmath19 and @xmath23 deviate from the ` match ' condition .",
    "therefore , the current through skewed s - mtj characterizes similarity between the gate voltages @xmath19 and @xmath23 . moreover ,",
    "a current - based similarity index in skewed s - mtj is suitable for an easier inter - cell aggregation and for evaluating similarity between large scale vectors / patterns .",
    "when multiple skewed s - mtjs are arranged in parallel , the column current aggregates the similarity index ( i.e. , the s - mtj current @xmath18 ) from each cell .",
    "therefore , the column current evaluates similarity between two vectors / patterns , each applied at the @xmath19 and @xmath23 nodes of the column , respectively .",
    "we have exploited this associative processing capability of s - mtj in tcam design .",
    "4 discusses the encoding scheme for implementing match operation of a tcam cell through a single skewed s - mtj . in fig .",
    "4 , s - mtj current ( @xmath18 ) is shown at varying search bit potentials ( i.e. , @xmath19 potential ) and at varying stored bits ( i.e. , @xmath23 potential ) . the search bits ` x ' , ` 0 ' , and ` 1 '",
    "are encoded as 0 v , 0.2 v , and 0.4 v , respectively .",
    "the store bits ` 1 ' , ` 0 ' , and ` x ' center the valley peak to 0.2 v , 0.4 v , and 0.6 v , respectively . in the encoding scheme , a high s - mtj current ( i.e. , a lower resistance in the s - mtj ) indicates a match between the stored and search bit .",
    "if the stored bit in a cell is ` x ' , current through the s - mtj is high at all search bits ` 0 ' , ` 1 ' & ` x ' , thereby ignoring ( masking ) the search bit .",
    "similarly , when the search bit is ` x ' , a high current is induced in the s - mtj indicating a match irrespective of the stored bit .",
    "therefore , the skewed s - mtj significantly reduces the complexity of match operation in a tcam .",
    "the cell schematics for an s - mtj - based dynamic tcam is shown in fig .",
    "the cells exploit high parasitic capacitance at @xmath23 node for a dynamic storage of the storage bit .",
    "note that the capacitance at @xmath23 is high due to an underlying high dielectric constant ( @xmath45 1000 ) piezoelectric layer .",
    "the parasitic capacitance can be further enhanced by thinning down the piezoelectric layer , and/or by increasing the contact area of @xmath23 electrode atop the piezoelectric layer .",

    "nonvolatile storage in the standard mtjs eliminates standby power dissipation in the tcam array . a narrow valley in the transfer characteristic of an s - mtj ( see fig .",
    "4 ) scales down the required minimum voltage difference between the stored logic ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' , leading to a lower bias current through m1 and lower dynamic power in charging search lines ( @xmath52 capacitance ) .",
    "moreover , only a single ended search word mapping ( unlike cmos designs ) is needed , resulting in lower dynamic power dissipation and lower wiring overheads .",

    "the reference resistance is configured such that it has a resistance in between the ` worst case match ' and the ` worst case one - bit mismatch ' . for an n - bit search word , the ` worst case match ' column resistance @xmath54 obeys the relation @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the worst case match resistance in an s - mtj - based tcam cell .",

    "<S> straintronic magneto - tunneling junction ( s - mtj ) switches , whose resistances are controlled with voltage - generated strain in the magnetostrictive free layer of the mtj , are extremely energy - efficient switches that would dissipate a few aj of energy during switching . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , they are also relatively error - prone and have low resistance on / off ratio . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that as computing elements , they are best suited for non - boolean architectures . here , we propose and analyze a ternary content addressable memory implemented with s - mtjs and some transistors . </S>",
    "<S> it overcomes challenges encountered by traditional all - transistor implementations , resulting in exceptionally high cell density and an energy - delay product that is orders of magnitude lower . </S>"
