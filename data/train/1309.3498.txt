    "a class of macromolecules , the polymers , has emerged for their potential applications in various fields , as superconducting materials , liquid crystal , and biocompatible polymers .",
    "also , in environmental science , they can be used for instance to remove pollutant from aqueous solutions , or bacteria , fungi and algae @xcite .",
    "we are particularly interested in polymers which perform interactions with metal ions such as copper ions ( cu@xmath1 ) , lead ions ( pb@xmath1 ) , and many others .",
    "one of the applications of this concept , being very promising , lies in membrane separation process .",
    "this technique is used to obtain highly purified water in industrial process , or to the contrary , to `` wash '' water after an industrial process before release it in the environment @xcite .",
    "the idea is to take advantage the interactions of particular polymers with metal ions in order to retain free metal ions from an aqueous solution ( water ) .",
    "the solution is then filtrate through a membrane , and due to the high molecular weight of the polymers , they can not cross the membrane .",
    "it results that , on one side , ions are retained by the polymers , while on the other side , water has crossed the membrane and is free of ions .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the reviews @xcite for a more precise description of this process .",
    "nevertheless , the development of this technique leads to some technical difficulties and gives rise to important questions in order to produce efficient methods . among these",
    ", they are the role of fouling effect ( adhesion of polymers to the membrane ) , aggregation phenomenon , concentration effect , interaction with the wall of the cell ( recipient ) and interaction with the fluid . for recent findings , techniques and models on the subject we refer to the works in @xcite .",
    "to go further in this direction of a better understanding of such processes , we decided to propose a new model that accounts for the polymers - metal ions and polymers - polymers interactions .",
    "the model we develop here differs from the one derived for instance in @xcite where they used macroscopic quantities and equilibrium theory .",
    "indeed , here we propose a new approach , ever used in other physical problems such as ostwald ripening or coagulation - fragmentation equation , but , up to our knowledge , has never been formalised in this way for water - polymers in interactions with metal ions .",
    "the particularity of this problem reveals mathematical difficulties as for the existence and uniqueness of solution , the numerical approximation , and the long - time behaviour of the solution . in this work",
    ", we start to answer to some of these questions and give some hints on the behaviour of the solution .",
    "the remainder of this introduction set the theory and derive the model studied in the present work .",
    "a polymer is a macromolecule made up of many repeat units called monomers . to illustrate this definition ,",
    "an example of polymer is the poly(acrylic acid ) , a synthetic polymers .",
    "indeed , the acrylic acid which has the molecular formula @xmath2 plays the role of the monomer , whereas the poly(acrylic acid ) is a succession of acrylic acid , forming a chain , and has the molecular formula @xmath3 , where @xmath4 stands for the number of occurrences of the monomer .",
    "the model we investigate below concerns highly soluble polymers , particularly water - soluble polymers .",
    "rather , it aims at modelling the interactions between these polymers and metal ions in solution .",
    "these interactions are responsible for the retention of metal ions by the polymer and take place in specific sites of the chain , called functional groups .",
    "the functional groups are repeat subunits of the polymer able to hold one metal ion each .",
    "it is a group of atoms are molecules and it can be , or the monomer itself , or else composed of several monomers .",
    "its composition fluctuates according to : the structure of the chain ; the metal ions used ; as well as the type of interaction committed .",
    "the reader can refer to @xcite to get some examples of such polymers , but , among these we mention polyelectrolytes and polychelatogens .",
    "the former is a class of polymers whose functional groups are charged , so metal ions bind to them by an electrostatic interaction . for instance , the monomer of the poly ( acrylic acid ) polymer above - mentioned , loose a proton ( @xmath5 ) in solution leading to a negatively charged polymer . while for the latter metal ions bind to functional groups forming coordinate bonds . however ,",
    "some polymers combine both interactions , even sometimes others weakest interactions can take place , see @xcite .",
    "furthermore , all depends on both the polymer and the metal ion considered .",
    "nevertheless , here we follow @xcite and we assume the interactions modelled might be formulated as reversible chemical reactions .",
    "thus , we acknowledge two processes here : the binding process which consists in the association between a metal ion and a functional group of a polymer also named adsorption ; and the opposite process which consists in the dissociation of a metal ion from a functional group or desorption .",
    "both processes formed the sorption phenomenon .",
    "modeling such interactions , between water - soluble polymers and metal ions , recently received a considerable attention .",
    "several models has been developed , analysed and compared to experimental data , we would mention again the works made in @xcite .",
    "the authors mainly deal with macroscopic quantities , which are the concentrations of metal ions bound to polymers and free , the concentration of polymers , _ etc _ , together with equilibrium theory to build suitable models .    in the present work , we derive a model that accounts for the evolution of a system of interacting particles consisting of water - soluble polymers and metal ions in solution .",
    "its establishment resides in a chemical formulation of both microscopic processes ( association and dissociation ) . for this , let us label by @xmath6 a polymer consisting of @xmath7 functional groups , such that @xmath8 of them are associated to a metal ion .",
    "the variable @xmath9 can reach any numbers ( at least theoretically ) , indeed the polymers can be as big as the technology permits it . then , the number @xmath8 belongs to @xmath10 by definition of a functional groups , since each functional group reacts with one and only one metal ion , thus a polymer made up of @xmath7 functional groups can not bind more than @xmath7 metal ions .",
    "remark , it makes clear that if @xmath8 is the number of functional groups occupied by a metal ion , it is also the number of metal ion bound to the polymer .",
    "the couple @xmath11 is named the configuration of the polymer . finally , we label by @xmath12 a free metal ions , free meaning that it is dissolved and not bound to a polymer .",
    "the reversible chemical reaction between one free metal ion @xmath12 and one polymer @xmath6 is @xmath13{k_{x , y } } p_{x , y+1},\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the binding rate ( or association rate ) at which a polymer of configuration @xmath11 interacts with a metal ions to get a new configuration @xmath15 , while @xmath16 is the dissociation rate at which a metal ions is removed from a polymer @xmath15 , and this latter gets the new configuration @xmath11 .",
    "both rates depend on the configuration of the polymer and inherently on the surrounding conditions ( ph of the solution , temperature , _ etc _ ) supposed to be fixed .",
    "in addition to polymer - metal ion interactions , we take into account polymer -polymer interactions .",
    "actually , under experimental conditions , the presence of other polymers leads to inter - polymer complexes and can produce gels or precipitates , as pointed out in @xcite .",
    "we incorporate in the model the formation of inter - polymer complexes through a binary coagulation , which is the formation of a biggest polymer from two smaller ones .",
    "this reaction can be written as follows : @xmath17 where the coagulation rate @xmath18 is the rate at which a polymer with the configuration @xmath11 and an other one with configuration @xmath19 will produce a new biggest macromolecule .",
    "the reaction preserves the number of functional groups and metal ions bound , so the new polymers gets the configuration @xmath20 .",
    "+    we devote the next section to establish the set of equations studied in the remainder of this paper . to this end",
    "we would finish here by some comments on the mathematical objects used .",
    "first , we use evolution equation which means solutions to the system will be time - dependent functions and are not at the equilibrium yet .",
    "second , the experiments use generally an high number of particles ( both polymers and metal ions ) .",
    "that is why quantities are expressed in term of their molar or mass concentration .",
    "so that , we introduce two new convenient variables , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively for the mole of functional groups and the mole of associated ( to metal ions ) functional groups , where @xmath23 the inverse of the avogadro s number .",
    "both variables @xmath24 and @xmath25 can reach a continuum of values , so we consider them as continuous variables on the contrary to variables @xmath7 and @xmath8 which are natural number .",
    "thus , the states of the system at a time @xmath26 will be given by a configurational distribution function @xmath27 where the quantity @xmath28 provides the molar concentration of polymers in the system having a configuration in the subset @xmath29 of the configurational space ( defined latter ) .",
    "it could be possible to keep a discrete version of the problem considering the concentration of all the @xmath6 with @xmath7 and @xmath8 the number of functional groups ( as natural number ) . nevertheless , it is sometimes mathematically less tractable due to the huge number of equations involved .",
    "but , the continuous model can be seen as a limit of the discrete one , through an appropriate rescaling and here we have in mind the parameters @xmath30 .",
    "the reader can make himself an idea , on what would be the discrete model here and how it is linked to the continous one , in @xcite where rigorous derivations of the continuous lifshitz - slyozov equation from the becker - dring model is made .",
    "both model being closed to the one presented here .",
    "below , we use the two continuous variables for the polymer configuration .",
    "first , @xmath31 the quantity in mole of functional groups .",
    "second , @xmath32 the quantity in mole of functional groups associate each to a metal ion .",
    "we name , the variable @xmath25 : the quantity of occupied functional groups ( in mole ) .",
    "thus , the set of admissible configurations @xmath33 is : @xmath34 indeed , the polymer can reach any size , so its number of functional groups can be as large as we want . while its number of occupied functional groups can belong to @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e _ up to the total number of functional groups of the polymer .",
    "then , we define the configurational distribution function of polymers , denoted by @xmath36 , as a function of time @xmath37 over the configuration space @xmath38 . the system governing the evolution of @xmath27 is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coagulation operator and @xmath41 denotes the rate of association - dissociation or by other means the sorption rate .",
    "the latter determines the mechanism of ions transfer with a polymer ( association and dissociation of ions ) , it is the continuous operator describing reaction , while the former rules the polymer - polymer interaction given by , where both are defined below . equation on the configurational distribution function is not enough to characterised all the system . to complete the model , it remains to introduce a second equation on the molar concentration of free metal - ions ( being in the solution but unbound to polymers ) .",
    "we denote this concentration by @xmath42 , as a function of time @xmath37 , and it is given by the constraint of metal ions conservation ( bound and free ) , namely @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a constant which stands for the total quantity of metal ions in the system ( bound and unbound to polymers ) . indeed ,",
    "as @xmath45 approaches the molar concentration of polymers with configuration @xmath33 in the limit of @xmath46 and @xmath47 small , if we multiply this quantity by @xmath25 the number of occupied functional groups (= the number of metal ions bounded ) in mole , thus we get the molar concentration of metal ions bounded onto the polymers with such a configuration .",
    "thus , the integral term in account for the molar concentration of metal ions associated to polymers and the balance equation expresses the conservation of matter , between associate and free metal ions in the system .",
    "let us now define more precisely the rate @xmath41 of metal ions association - dissociation . as a general form for @xmath41 we consider the following chemical reaction rate @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the association rate , or adsorption , at which a free monomers bind to a polymer ( depending on the type of interaction and the diffusion rate of the particles ) and @xmath50 is the dissociation rate , or desorption ( depending on the strength of the interaction ) .",
    "the association rate is multiply by @xmath51 , as a classical law of mass action and for sake of simplicity we restrict ourselves to @xmath52 which is the order of the reaction .",
    "a relevant example of association - dissociation rate would be an analogy to the langmuir s law ( for the adsorption of metal ions onto a surface ) , namely @xmath53 with @xmath54 parameters and @xmath55 geometrical factor , see @xcite .",
    "indeed , the association rate depends on the quantity of available functional groups @xmath56 while the dissociation rate depends only on the quantity of metal ions bound to the polymers @xmath25 ( the more metal ions , the more the probability of a dissociation is great ) .",
    "next we explicit the coagulation operator @xmath40 with the coagulation rate @xmath57 defined as a nonnegative function over @xmath58 satisfying the symmetry assumption @xmath59 it gives the rate at which two polymers with the configuration @xmath33 and @xmath60 will coagulate .",
    "the symmetry assumption follows form the impossibility in the system to distinguish the coagulation of a @xmath33 with a @xmath60 or the coagulation of a @xmath60 with a @xmath33 because it is the same reaction .",
    "then , @xmath40 can be decomposed by a gain term @xmath61 and a depletion term @xmath62 that is @xmath63 where @xmath64 the gain term @xmath61 accounts for the production of a polymer with a configuration @xmath33 thanks to the coagulation of a @xmath60 with @xmath65 and a @xmath66 with @xmath67 . likewise ,",
    "the depletion term account for the disappearance in the system of a polymer @xmath33 when coagulate to any other @xmath60 for the benefit of a new polymer with configuration @xmath68 .",
    "the problem - is completed by a dirichlet boundary condition:@xmath69 which of course suppose suitable assumptions on the characteristics discussed later .",
    "finally , we require two initial conditions:@xmath70      the remainder of this paper is devoted to the existence of global solutions to problem - , its numerical approximation , simulations and a discussion on the long - time behaviour .    in section [ sec",
    ": analysis ] , we establish in theorem [ thm : wellposed ] the existence of global solutions . the proof is based on fixed point theorems two treat the non - linear terms , one for the coagulation operator - , the second for the constraint .",
    "the technique used , implying hypotheses on the regularity of the coefficients , is based on the works on lifshitz - slyozov ( ls ) equation in @xcite and ls with encounters ( coagulation ) in @xcite .",
    "techniques also adapted in @xcite for biological polymers .",
    "the ls equation is a size structured model for clusters ( polymers or more general ) formation by addition - depletion of monomers @xcite , while ls with encounters also take into account merging clusters .",
    "the coagulation ( only size - dependent ) is part of the class of coagulation - fragmentation ( cf ) equation , where fragmentation is the reverse operator ( break - up , splitting of clusters ) , and it has been studied from a mathematical point of view for instance in @xcite , also in @xcite for the cf equation with space diffusion , and in @xcite which generalized cf equation with a kinetic approach .",
    "the particularity of the model here , is the boundary conditions and the conservation involves .",
    "both necessitates a careful attention in the proof of existence .",
    "the former requests to treat the characteristics that come from the boundary , the latter need a particular attention due to the nature of the configurational space .    in section [",
    "sec : scheme ] , we propose a finite volume scheme to construct numerical solutions approaching the problem .",
    "the numerical scheme is in the spirit of the works made in @xcite and @xcite , where the authors propose a reformulation of the cf equation in a manner well - adapted to a finite volume scheme , namely a conservative form . here , we write a similar conservative form , but as a cross derivative with respect to both variables . for suitable numerical scheme",
    ", we also refer to @xcite for ls , to @xcite for ls with encounters and to @xcite for a model with space diffusion .",
    "then the rest of the section is devoted to the proof of the convergence result given in theorem [ thm : convergence ] .",
    "it is based on @xmath71 weak compactness of sequences of approximations .",
    "we emphasis that the numerical scheme introduced here takes its originality in the introduction of the cross - derivative for the coagulation operator .",
    "the main difficulty reside in its approximation which involves new conservation .",
    "moreover , we get a better regularity in the weak stability principle result than in @xcite , which may also apply to their case .    in section [ sec : illustration ] ,",
    "we present a numerical simulation which is produced by the numerical scheme . based on this simulation ,",
    "we discuss and interpret the long - time behaviour of the model and we show how it might be related to the behaviour of a non - autonomous coagulation equation . here , it might be very interesting to connect this problem to @xcite on the ls and related model or @xcite for the coagulation equation .",
    "the nature of the configurational space @xmath38 is not really convenient for computations both for the theoretical point of view and the numerical implementation .",
    "thus , we decide to rescale the problem and operate a change of variable in the distribution @xmath27 with respect to a physically relevant new variable @xmath72 .",
    "we call it the ion ratio ( without dimension ) and its definition is , for @xmath73 , @xmath74 we introduce then the new unknown @xmath75 defined , over the new configuration space @xmath76 , by @xmath77 then , we operate a a change of variable in the association - dissociation and coagulation rates , by introducing @xmath78 define over @xmath79 and @xmath80 over @xmath81 , such that @xmath82 thus , they satisfy @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 . also , the symmetry assumption becomes @xmath86 a formal computation leads to the assessment @xmath87 finally , letting @xmath88 such that @xmath89 with @xmath90 , we get @xmath91 in the following and for the rest we drop tildes in the rescaled problem , for sake of clarity .",
    "now , we are able to reformulate the problem which is to find the distribution @xmath27 satisfying @xmath92 with the constraint @xmath93 and boundary condition remains given by @xmath94 while the initial conditions is only a change of variables in : @xmath95      the study of the problem - with and requires hypothesis whether they naturally arise in the problem or technicals .",
    "namely , we assume that :    * h1 . *",
    "the initial distribution @xmath96 is nonnegative and @xmath97 such that    @xmath98    * h2 . * the coagulation rate @xmath99 is nonnegative , satisfies and    @xmath100    * h3 . * the rates functions @xmath101 are both nonnegatives and @xmath102 and for all @xmath103 , @xmath104    * h4 .",
    "* for all @xmath105 and @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 here , @xmath109 denotes a constant .",
    "note that ensures the characteristics remain in the set @xmath110 and allows us to prescribe the boundary .",
    "in fact , it is equivalent with respect to and ( h4 ) to assume @xmath111 for all @xmath112 .    with such variables",
    ", we note that example becomes @xmath113 and , hypothesis ( h4 ) is consistent with this example .",
    "now , we are in position to give a definition of the solutions to the problem - .",

    "assume that @xmath115 and @xmath116 satisfy ( h1 ) and that hypotheses ( h2)-(h4 ) are fulfilled .",
    "then , there exists a solution @xmath118 to the problem - in the sense of definition [ def : solution ] .",
    "moreover , the solution has the regularity @xmath128 with both @xmath129 and @xmath130    proof of theorem [ thm : wellposed ] relies on 2 main steps , which are similar to the ones used for instance in @xcite and @xcite for ls equation .",
    "the first step consists in the construction of a mild solution @xmath27 of equation for a given @xmath131 .",
    "this is achieved through a fixed point theorem by virtue of the contraction property of the coagulation operator .",
    "the second step follows a second fixed point which associates to the constraint on @xmath131 .",

    "thus , there exist @xmath216 such that @xmath217 this achieves the proof of theorem [ thm : wellposed ] .",
    "the discretization of the problem - gives rise to three main difficulties .",

    "the link between both problems , truncated and full , when @xmath179 is not taken in consideration here .",
    "the reader can refer to step 2 in the proof of proposition [ prop : autonomous ] to get some hints related to this topic .",
    "the purpose is to provide a converging numerical approximation of a truncated problem for a fixed @xmath183 .",
    "the second issue arises when we look toward conservations of the system . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors propose a reformulation of the coagulation operator into a divergence form .",
    "we are inspired by this method and adapt it to our problem .",
    "indeed , this formulation appears natural for finite volume scheme and has the advantage to provide exact conservations at the discrete level .",
    "the starting point is the weak formulation of @xmath40 , see .",
    "one can take @xmath220 for some @xmath221 and we formally get an expression of the form @xmath222 where the coagulation reads now @xmath223 where @xmath224 .",

    "these two options can be derived respectively by taking @xmath225 or @xmath226 .",
    "the first option avoids the formation of clusters larger than @xmath183 thus it will preserve the mass , while the second induces a loss of polymers due to the creation of larger clusters than @xmath183 .",
    "this latter is convenient to study gelation phenomenon , see @xcite for a review on coagulation . here , we restrict ourself to the conservative form and obtain the truncated operator by taking @xmath227 then , replacing @xmath228 by @xmath229 in it yields , for any @xmath230 , to @xmath231 the last main issue lies in the discretization of , _ i.e. _ the algebraic constraint driving @xmath131",
    ". we will not be able to properly derive an approximation of @xmath232 in the coagulation operator which would allow us to control the sign of @xmath233 .",
