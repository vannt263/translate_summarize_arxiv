    "during the last decades a variety of metal surfaces , such as be(0001 ) and the ( 111 ) surfaces of the noble metals cu , ag , and au , have become a testing ground for many experimental and theoretical investigations.@xcite these surfaces are known to support a partially occupied band of shockley surface states with energies near the fermi level .",
