    "in 1960 branko grnbaum ( * ? ? ? * sec.4.(v ) ) suggested the following innocent - looking problem :    can any convex body in @xmath0 be cut into @xmath2 pieces of equal volume by @xmath1 suitably - chosen affine hyperplanes ?    as grnbaum noted , this is quite easy to prove for @xmath14 . in 1966",
    "hadwiger @xcite answered grnbaum s question ( positively ) for @xmath15 , while solving a problem raised by j. w. jaworowski ( oberwolfach , 1963 ) .",
    "in the course of his argument , he was led to consider the partition of two masses by two planes in @xmath16 .",
    "grnbaum s question was independently raised in computational geometry , motivated by the construction of data structures for range queries . in this context",
    ", willard @xcite reproved the case @xmath17 , while the case @xmath15 was reproved by yao , dobkin , edelsbrunner & paterson @xcite .    in 1984",
    "avis @xcite answered grnbaum s problem negatively for @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , one can not expect a positive answer there , since @xmath1 hyperplanes in @xmath0 can be described by @xmath18 parameters , while the hyperplanes one is looking for need to satisfy @xmath19 independent conditions , and @xmath20 for @xmath21 .",
    "the case @xmath5 was left open : `` the situation in @xmath22-space is not settled in general '' @xcite .    in 1996",
    "ramos @xcite formulated the general version of the hyperplane mass partition problem for several masses :    [ gruenbaumproblem0 ] for each @xmath23 and @xmath24 , determine the smallest dimension @xmath25 such that for every collection of @xmath7 masses @xmath26 on @xmath0 there are @xmath8 affine hyperplanes that cut each of the @xmath7 masses into @xmath9 equal pieces .",
    "so grnbaum s question was whether @xmath27 .",
    "the special case @xmath28 of the grnbaum  hadwiger  ramos problem , for a single hyperplane @xmath29 , is settled by the so - called ham - sandwich theorem , which was conjectured by steinhaus and proved by banach in 1938 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this turned out to be an incarnation of the borsuk ",
    "ulam theorem , an important and central result of early algebraic topology , with applications that range from discrete geometry to nonlinear pdes ; see @xcite for surveys .",
    "it turns out , however , that the most natural configuration spaces parameterizing @xmath8-tuples of oriented affine hyperplanes are products of spheres , such as @xmath30 , which do not have the high connectivity that is required for a simple application of borsuk  ulam type machinery ( e.g.  via dold s theorem ; see matouek @xcite for an introduction to this approach ) .",
    "thus more sophisticated machinery is needed in order to decide about the existence of the equivariant maps proposed by various applications of the `` configuration space / test map scheme '' ( as developed by sarkaria and ivaljevi ; see again @xcite for an introduction ) .",
    "methods that have been employed to settle such existence problems include    equivariant cohomology ( the fadell ",
    "husseini index @xcite ) ,    equivariant obstruction theory ( see tom dieck ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.ii.3 ) ) , and    the normal bordism approach of koschorke @xcite .",
    "in this paper we attempt to provide a status report about the partial results obtained for the grnbaum  hadwiger ",
    "ramos problem up to now .",
    "this in particular includes the lower and upper bounds @xmath31 where @xmath32 is @xmath7 `` rounded down to the nearest power of @xmath12 , '' so @xmath33 .",
    "the lower bound was derived by avis @xcite ( for @xmath34 ) and ramos @xcite from measures concentrated on the moment curve .",
    "the upper bound was obtained by mani - levitska , vreica & ivaljevi @xcite from a fadell  husseini index calculation .",
    "a table below will show that there is quite a gap between the lower and the upper bounds  they only coincide in the ham - sandwich case @xmath28 , and in the case of two hyperplanes if @xmath35 is a power of  @xmath12 , with @xmath36 .",
    "all the available evidence , up to now is consistent with the expectation that ramos lower bound is tight for all @xmath7 and  @xmath8 ; we will refer to this in the following as the _ ramos conjecture_. for example , while the above bounds specialize to @xmath37 , hadwiger @xcite proved that indeed @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the general lower and upper bounds , a number of papers have treated special cases , reductions , and relatives of the problem . as a basis for further work ( by the present authors and by others ) , we will in the following provide a critical review of all the key contributions to this study , which will also include short proofs as far as feasible . in this context we have to observe , however , that quite a number of published proofs do not hold up upon critical inspection , and indeed some of the approaches employed can not work . as some of these errors have not been pointed out in print ( although they may be known to experts )",
    ", we will provide detailed reviews and explanations in these cases .",
    "we have , however , been able to salvage one of these results , with different methods : we will prove below ( theorem  [ thm : delta(2^t+1,2 ) ] ) that @xmath10 also holds if @xmath11 is a power of  @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "so in this case again the ramos lower bound is tight while the mani - levitska et al .",
    "upper bound is not .",
    "( it is tight in the case @xmath39 . )",
    "any affine hyperplane @xmath40 , given by a vector @xmath41 and scalar @xmath42 , determines two closed halfspaces , which we denote by @xmath43 let @xmath44 be an _ arrangement _ ( ordered tuple ) of @xmath24 affine hyperplanes in @xmath0 , and @xmath45 .",
    "the _ orthant _ determined by the arrangement @xmath44 and an element @xmath46 is the intersection of halfspaces @xmath47 a _ mass _ on @xmath0 is a finite borel measure on @xmath0 that vanishes on every affine hyperplane . without loss of generality",
    "we deal only with probability measures ( that is , masses such that @xmath48 ) . examples of masses that appear frequently include    measures given by the @xmath1-dimensional volume of a compact convex body @xmath49 ,    measures induced by an interval on the moment curve in @xmath0 ,    measures given by a finite family of ( small , disjoint ) balls .",
    "an arrangement @xmath50 _ equiparts _ a collection of masses @xmath51 if for every element @xmath46 and every @xmath52 @xmath53 clearly this can happen only if @xmath54 .",
    "the grnbaum  hadwiger ",
    "ramos problem thus asks for the smallest dimension @xmath55 in which any collection @xmath26 of @xmath7  masses in @xmath0 admits an arrangement @xmath44 of @xmath8 affine hyperplanes that equiparts  @xmath26 .    for the proofs using equivariant topology methods , we make additional assumptions on the masses to be considered , namely that the measures @xmath56 that we deal with have",
    "compact connected support .",
    "this assumption can be made as we can strongly approximate each mass by masses with compact connected support .",
    "( this can be done `` _ _ mit passender grenzbetrachtung und kompaktheitserwgung auf die bliche schulmige weise _ _ ''",
    "* s.  275 ) as we learn from hadwiger . )",
    "it guarantees that the measure captured by an affine halfspace depends continuously on the halfspace , and more generally that the measure captured by an orthant depends continuously on the hyperplanes that define the orthant .",
    "moreover , it yields that for any mass @xmath57 and a given vector @xmath58 the hyperplane @xmath59 that halves the mass @xmath57 is unique , and depends continuously on  @xmath58 .",
    "one could also allow for measures supported on finitely many points , as often considered in the computational geometry context ; see e.g.   @xcite and @xcite .",
    "such point measures do _ not _ satisfy the assumptions above , but they can be approximated by masses that do . to accomodate for point measures , one would have to modify the definition of `` equiparts '' in such a way that each open orthant captures _ at most _ a fraction of @xmath60 of each measure .",
    "we have noted that the ham - sandwich theorem yields @xmath28 and that trivially @xmath61 . a stronger lower bound",
    "was given by ramos @xcite : @xmath62 ramos believed that his bound is tight :    @xmath63 for every @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the best upper bound to date , due to mani - levitska et al .",
    "* thm.39 ) , can be phrased as follows : @xmath66 the proofs of these bounds are subject of section  [ sec : bounds ] ( theorems  [ thm : lower - bound ] and [ thm : upper - bound ] ) . in particular , for @xmath67 and @xmath68 the lower bound and the upper bound   coincide , implying that @xmath69    the first result that is not a consequence of a coincidence between the lower and upper bounds and is due to hadwiger @xcite , who showed that two masses in  @xmath16 can be simultaneously cut into four equal parts by two ( hyper)planes .",
    "we give a degree - based proof for this result in section [ sec : hadwiger ] ( theorem  [ thm : hadwiger ] ) : @xmath70 as hadwiger observed , by a simple reduction this also implies that @xmath71 .    despite a number of published papers in prominent journals on new cases of the ramos conjecture , the values and bounds for @xmath6",
    "just mentioned appear to be the only ones available before with correct proofs : the papers by ramos @xcite from 1996 , by mani - levitska et al .",
    "@xcite from 2006 , and by ivaljevi @xcite from 2008 and @xcite from 2011 all contain essential gaps ; see sections  [ sec : the failure ] , [ sec : ramos ] and [ sec : further_gaps ] . in table",

    "* lemma6.2 ) and obtain the results in table  [ fig_ramos_upper_bounds ] , ramos restricts the configuration space a second time with the goal of obtaining more cases where the matrix permanent is odd . instead of a product of balls",
