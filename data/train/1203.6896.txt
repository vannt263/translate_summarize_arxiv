    "the winter conferences have brought forth a host of new experimental results from the lhc . continuing the 2011 trend ,",
    "the standard model ( sm ) stands tall , and there are no strong hints of new physics beyond sm ( bsm ) . on the flavor front ,",
    "a fit  @xcite to @xmath0 events by lhcb with 1 fb@xmath5 data yields @xmath6 that is in good agreement with sm , while combining the @xmath7 ( the @xmath8 violating phase of @xmath9 mixing ) measurement with the result from @xmath10 gives @xmath11 which is fully consistent with the result of @xmath12 with 1/3 the dataset . again with 1 fb@xmath5 data",
    ", lhcb has advanced the measurement of forward - backward asymmetry in @xmath13 , giving a first measurement  @xcite of the zero - crossing point @xmath14 which is consistent with sm expectation of 4.04.3 gev@xmath15  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting then , that more apparent progress has been made on the quest for the @xmath2 rare decay mode : sm sensitivity has genuinely been reached , and data  @xcite might be suggestive of a rate _ below",
    "_ sm expectations . given that a decade long search for @xmath2 was motivated by the possible enhancement up to factors of hundreds to thousands , by powers  @xcite of @xmath16 in the settings of supersymmetry or two higgs doublet models , we are now at the juncture of a mindset change , switching from possible huge enhancements of old , to sm - like or even sub - sm values as it might emerge .",
    "it is in this context that we wish to explore in this brief report the implications on relevant flavor parameters involving a fourth generation of quarks , @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( sm4 ) .",
    "it should be noted that bounds on @xmath17 and @xmath18 masses have reached  @xcite the 600 gev level by direct search at the lhc , hence we have nominally crossed the threshold of the unitarity bound ( ub ) of 500550 gev  @xcite . in the following , we will proceed naively , extending our previous work  @xcite , and return to comment on ub and other issues towards the end of our discussion .",
    "it is difficult to enhance @xmath2 in sm4 by more than a factor of two or three , because it is constrained by @xmath19 ( together with @xmath20 ) , which is consistent with sm .",
    "hence , this mode appeared less relevant for sm4 , until recently .",
    "in contrast , the aforementioned @xmath16 enhancement effect feeds scalar operators that do not enter @xmath21 and @xmath22 processes , hence were far less constrained .",
    "however , the scalar operators are now muted by the prowess of the lhc ( and previous searches at the tevatron ) .",
    "a dramatic turn of events were already played out in 2011 , where the combined result  @xcite of lhcb and cms , @xmath23 at 95% confidence level ( cl ) , refuted the cdf result  @xcite of @xmath24 , which was at the time itself hot - off - the - press . adding close to 3 fb@xmath5 data to the previous 7 fb@xmath5 analysis , the cdf value dropped a bit to @xmath25 , but the tevatron has ran out of steam .",
    "atlas has also turned out a bound of @xmath26 based on 2.4 fb@xmath5 data , which is not yet competitive even with summer 2011 results from lhcb or cms .",
    "the highlight this winter was therefore the @xmath27 results from cms and lhcb .",
    "let us first describe the lhcb result . using a multivariate analysis ( mva )",
    ", lhcb gave  @xcite the 95% cl bound of @xmath28 which is approaching rather close to the sm value  @xcite of @xmath29 in fact , lhcb gave a fitted number , @xmath30 which naively implies possibly negative branching ratio ! the central value is from the maximum log - likelihood , while the errors correspond to varying the log - likelihood by 0.5 .",
    "the main upshot may be that lhcb does not really see any clear hint of a sm - strength signal ! either this is a downward fluctuation of the  true sm \" value of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - sm ] ) , or nature has a sub - sm value in store for us .",
    "we caution , of course , that statistics is still rather low .",
    "the cms result  @xcite is , at 95% cl , @xmath31 by a cut - based analysis .",
    "a mild deficit seems to be indicated when compared with the median expected limit of @xmath32 .",
    "but the handful of events reveal some interesting pattern . in the barrel detector region",
    ", one expects @xmath33 signal events if sm were true , together with @xmath34 events from background .",
    "only two events were observed , which are separated by @xmath35 mev , wider than the nominal detector mass resolution .",
    "this suggests the presence of background events .",
    "whether this constitutes one event each for signal and background , or if both events are background , it seems to echo lhcb  @xcite in some  downward \" fluctuation from the sm value of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - sm ] ) .",
    "however , if both lhcb and cms sense a downward signal fluctuation , then the likelihood that the actual signal might be lower would be enhanced !    in the endcap detector region , the situation is a bit puzzling . here",
    ", signal and background are both expected at 1.2 event level , while a total of 4 events were seen  @xcite .",
    "but they all cluster within 50 mev or less , inside a signal mass window of 150 mev , which is set at twice the detector mass resolution ( poorer than in the barrel detector ) .",
    "however , since the endcap is less sensitive than the barrel , we refrain from further comment , except that the  excess \" events push up the bound of eq .",
    "( [ cms - mumu-5fb ] ) slightly .",
    "thus , by cms barrel detector alone , the  discrepancy \" with median expected is a little larger .",
    "although anything can happen at the present statistics level , lhcb expects to add @xmath36 1 fb@xmath5 in 2012 , while cms would add @xmath36 15 fb@xmath5 , both at the slightly higher collision energy of 8 tev .",
    "we therefore like to emulate future prospects as follows . for the indication of lower than sm rate",
    ", we shall take eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) at face value . projecting to full 2011 - 2012 data , besides the doubling of lhcb data , cms data should increase more than four fold ( an mva approach should increase the effective luminosity ) .",
    "although one can not really project what is the combined effective reduction of errors , we take the factor @xmath37 .",
    "i.e. in our subsequent numerics , besides the @xmath38 allowed range for eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) , we will show also the @xmath39 range , which would give @xmath40 . while this is rather aggressive",
    ", it would illustrate a sub - sm result when lhcb combined with cms probes genuinely below sm values .",
    "it is not impossible that , by end of 2011 - 2012 run , we find @xmath41 to be consistent with zero , i.e. at @xmath42 or less .",
    "we note that atlas could also eventually contribute significantly to @xmath27 search .",
    "the notable feature across the board for new physics search at the lhc , however , is that no cracks were found in sm s armor .",
    "thus , we offer a second case of sm - like behavior . here , we take the central value from sm , and mimic the current error bar by satisfying the 95% cl bound from cms .",
    "we get from eq .",
    "( [ cms - mumu-5fb ] ) , @xmath43 again , we will discuss the @xmath38 and @xmath39 allowed range of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - smlike ] ) for projections into the future",
    ". actual error reduction would likely be more than @xmath44 for sm - like central values in eq .",
    "( [ mumu - smlike ] ) .",
    "we follow our previous paper  @xcite and combine the above scenarios for @xmath41 with measurements of @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( we shorthand as @xmath47 below ) .",
    "our target physics is the flavor parameters of the fourth generation for @xmath48 transitions , namely @xmath49 .",
    "if the current hint for 125 gev sm - like higgs boson does not get substantiated by 2012 data , a very heavy fourth generation could provide the mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking through its strong yukawa interaction  @xcite .",
    "we will find that a sub - sm @xmath41 value would imply a _ lower bound _ on @xmath50 , which would be rather interesting .",
    "we had suggested that the three measurements of @xmath45 , @xmath41 and @xmath47 would help map out the preferred @xmath51 , or @xmath52 parameter space .",
    "the main measurements are @xmath45 and @xmath41 , with @xmath47 providing further discrimination , both in its shape , and now also the @xmath53 value  @xcite .",
    "three cases were discussed .",
    "case a was for large and negative @xmath45 , where we used @xmath54 , and enhanced @xmath55 .",
    "this was motivated by hints for large and negative time - dependent cpv in @xmath56 from tevatron studies .",
    "although a @xmath57 value could still be entertained at the 2@xmath58 level , there is not more to be said beyond our previous work , while the likelihood for enhanced @xmath41 is receding .",
    "thus , we no longer present this case .",
    "case b and c were for @xmath59 taking sm value of @xmath60 , while @xmath61 takes the slightly enhanced or depressed values of @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively . by design ,",
    "the overlap between case b and case c is precisely when @xmath41 is sm - like .",
    "thus , the three cases of a , b and c map out the foreseen parameter space in @xmath64 and @xmath65 as data improves .    with the present experimental situation for @xmath41 , which could either be sub - sm as in eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) , or sm - like , as in eq .",
    "( [ mumu - smlike ] ) , we reinvestigate the implications for the preferred region in the @xmath64-@xmath65 plane . for both cases ,",
    "we impose the @xmath7 constraint of eq .",
    "( [ phis1203 ] ) . the observed shape and @xmath53 value from @xmath47",
    "are further applied to constrain parameter space .",
    "we take @xmath66 gev for sake of illustration .",
    "the @xmath67@xmath68 mixing amplitude is @xmath69 with @xmath70 where @xmath71 . with @xmath72 and @xmath73 as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( [ del12s ] ) manifestly respects gim  @xcite .",
    "the cpv phase @xmath74 depends only on @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "note that @xmath77 . although we take pdg  @xcite values for the phase of @xmath78 , it is exciting that the phase of @xmath79 is starting to be directly measured via interference of tree processes . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the @xmath80 dependence is largely removed  @xcite by taking the ratio with @xmath81 , which works for sm4 as in sm .",
    "that is , @xmath82 where @xmath83 , and @xmath84 is taken .",
    "we plot , in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the contours for @xmath85 within @xmath38 and @xmath86 range of eq .",
    "( [ phis1203 ] ) , in the @xmath87 , @xmath88 plane , for @xmath66 gev . here",
    ", lhcb holds a monopoly , and statistics is expected to only double during 2012 . similarly for @xmath41 , we plot the contours within @xmath38 and @xmath89 range of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) , which is sub - sm in strength .",
    "the @xmath75 value used is beyond the 550 gev nominal ub bound  @xcite , and one is no longer sure of the numerical accuracy of eqs .",
    "( [ del12s ] ) and ( [ brbsmumu ] ) , i.e. the perturbative computation of the functions @xmath73 and @xmath90 would become questionable . however , some form such as eq .",
    "( [ del12s ] ) should continue to hold even above the ub , and we shall continue to use existing formulas .",
    "the overlap between the @xmath85 and @xmath41 contours now favor @xmath65 in the 4th quadrant with @xmath91 small , where the darker regions are for more aggressive error projections towards the future .",
    "it should be clear that a precise determination of @xmath65 depends much more on the precision of @xmath85 measurement .",
    "we remark that fig .",
    "1(a ) is a much more stringent version of case c presented in our previous paper , where we now have @xmath41 considerably below sm expectation .",
    "thus , the most notable feature is that , even at @xmath38 error level , @xmath64 is now _ bounded from below_. this is because the ( current lhcb  @xcite ) central value of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) is more than @xmath38 below the sm expectation of @xmath92 .",
    "thus , it calls for a finite @xmath17 effect to subtract , or destructively interfere , against the sm amplitude from top quark . that this might become the picture for flavor parameters involving 4th generation , if a lower than sm value for @xmath41 is found at the lhc , is the main point of this short note .",
    "it should be stressed that this is a natural consequence for sm4 , since we know from existing constraints that @xmath17-induced amplitudes must be subdominant in strength compared with top - induced amplitudes , while the sign of the real part of @xmath51 can precisely be correlated with what experiments observe .    the sm - like case of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - smlike ] ) is less interesting , but given the continued success of the sm into the lhc era , should be viewed as more probable .",
    "we illustrate in fig .",
    "1(b ) for @xmath66 gev the overlap of the contours for @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ phis1203 ] ) and @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ mumu - smlike ] ) . besides some high @xmath64 region for modest @xmath93 values",
    ", the generic feature is relatively small @xmath64 , with @xmath65 undetermined by the present precision of @xmath65 measurement .",
    "this small @xmath64 case is rather intuitive , that of subdued 4th generation effect .",
    "we shall see that the larger @xmath64 values are ruled out by the observation of sm - like behavior for @xmath47 , as we have seen in our previous paper .",
    "the sm - like shape for @xmath47 as observed by lhcb provides a powerful discriminant against larger @xmath64 values .",
    "note that data prior to summer 2011 had suggested a deviation from sm behavior  @xcite , which , besides a hint for sizable deviation in @xmath59 , was part of the motivation for case a in our previous paper .",
    "the sm - like shape for @xmath47 is further affirmed with 1 fb@xmath5 data from lhcb  @xcite , while the first measurement for zero - crossing point , eq .",
    "( [ s01203 ] ) , is offered .",
    "we have checked the allowed parameter space of fig .  1 and find generically that @xmath94 would generate significant deviations in shape for @xmath47 .",
    "the drop from roughly @xmath95  @xcite to @xmath96 is due to the higher @xmath66 gev taken to satisfy direct search bounds  @xcite , as well as the tighter experimental constraints towards sm .",
    "we note with interest that , for the sub - sm @xmath3 case , the slightly larger than sm central value of @xmath97 gev@xmath15 in eq .",
    "( [ s01203 ] ) also prefers @xmath65 in the 4th quadrant .",
    "after some hints for bsm physics for some years , both in @xmath46 and in @xmath59  @xcite , sm is reaffirmed by 2011 data from lhc .",
    "interestingly , now there might be a hint for @xmath3 below sm expectations .",
    "it is of course too early to tell .",
    "however , this mode has always been looked upon as possibly greatly enhanced by the less constrained scalar operators .",
    "we are at least at the turning point , where no large enhancement is observed , but now whether it is sm - like , or sub - sm , can be distinguished with full 2011 - 2012 data . the 4th generation @xmath17 quark offers the natural toolbox in this domain , as it is constrained to be subdominant by @xmath21 and @xmath98 data since a decade , while providing a destructive mechanism in the unknown phase of @xmath51 .",
    "in contrast , adjusting the scalar interactions to the sm strength is like training a big hammer on a small nail .",
    "we note that , to have @xmath3 near the central value of eq .",
    "( [ mumu - subsm ] ) , the @xmath99 wilson coefficient would be considerably smaller than sm value , such that one would worry about @xmath100 .",
    "it is then interesting to not that lhcb data does seem to indicate that the @xmath101 differential rate could be a little lower than the sm expectations  @xcite .",
    "although a vanishing @xmath3 is unlikely ( more probably within @xmath102 ) , it would be interesting to watch this mutually supporting trend of somewhat lower @xmath3 and @xmath103 ( or @xmath100 ) .",
    "the darker region in fig .",
    "1(a ) is just to stress the point .",
    "we have used @xmath66 gev to satisfy direct search bounds , which is now beyond the nominal unitarity bound . to probe much further",
    ", the 13 - 14 tev run would be necessary .",
    "however , with the yukawa coupling turning nonperturbative , the phenomenology may change  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the leading production mode of @xmath104 is not affected .",
    "the usage of such large @xmath75 values is becoming dubious , and nonperturbative studies should be performed .",
    "the nonperturbative , strong yukawa coupling could actually be the source of electroweak symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting that , with full 2011 - 2012 data , we would learn whether a 125 gev higgs boson is substantiated , as well as whether @xmath27 is below sm expectations .    in conclusion",
    ", we illustrate what lhc data might tell us about 4th generation flavor parameters . assuming 2011 - 2012",
    "data would give @xmath105 and taking @xmath66 gev , we mocked the low @xmath2 rate case with @xmath40 , which would imply @xmath1060.004 , with @xmath107 . on the other hand ,",
    "if a sm - like @xmath2 rate emerges , it would imply small @xmath4 at a couple per mille , while @xmath108 would require more precise measurement of @xmath45 to determine .",
    "the @xmath13 forward - backward asymmetry provides a further discriminant that rules out @xmath109 for the discussed allowed regions . 0.3 cm * acknowledgement*. wsh is grateful to u. langenegger , s. stone and d.  tonelli for communications , and thanks the national science council for the academic summit grant nsc 100 - 2745-m-002 - 002-asp .",
