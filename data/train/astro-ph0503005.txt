    "in impulsive flares , strong hard x - ray emission from energetic electrons has been observed by _ yohkoh",
    "_ hxt ( masuda et al .  1994 ; see also a review by miller et al .",
    "the origin of energetic electrons is , however , unknown .",
    "the fast - mode shock is known to be a possible site for particle acceleration , for example in interplanetary space @xcite and supernova remnants @xcite . to solve the particle acceleration problem in solar flares",
    ", @xcite suggested a diffusive shock model at the loop top .",
    "this model , however , has not yet been fully examined .",
    "solar flares occur as a result of magnetic reconnection .",
    "the sxt and hxt on the _ yohkoh _ satellite discovered various pieces of evidence of magnetic reconnection ( tsuneta et al .",
    "1992 ; masuda et al .  1994",
    "; see review by shibata 1999 ) .",
    "the `` fast '' reconnection process suggested by @xcite can be supported by a localized resistivity ( e.g , anomalous resistivity ; ugai 1986 ; tanuma et al .",
    "2003 ; see also shibata , nozawa , & matsumoto 1992 ; miyagoshi & yokoyama 2003 ) .",
    "recently , @xcite investigated the reconnection triggered by a shock wave from a point explosion .",
    "they found that petschek reconnection occurs immediately after the `` secondary tearing instability '' ( furth , killeen , & rosenbluth 1963 ; see also magara & shibata 1999 ; shibata & tanuma 2001 ) , and that fast shocks are created in the reconnection jet . in this paper",
    ", we suggest that energetic electrons could be accelerated if the internal fast shocks could be created in solar flares ( figure [ illust ] ) . to examine this possibility ,",
    "we study how the internal shocks are created in the reconnection jet by performing 2d simulations with high spatial resolution .",
    "this should remove the effect of numerical noise and resolve the diffusion region .",
    "these simulations lead us to propose that multiple fast shocks are created in solar flares and they are possible sites of particle acceleration .",
    "our simulation method is described in the next section . in section 3",
    ", we present the simulation results .",
    "finally , we discuss the results .",
    "we solve the nonlinear , time - dependent , resistive , compressible mhd equations .",
    "a rectangular computation box with 2d cartesian coordinates in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane is assumed , where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes are in the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "we assume an ideal gas , i.e. , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the specific heat ratio ( = 5/3 ) .",
    "the velocity and magnetic field are @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "gravity is neglected .    in the initial equilibrium conditions ,",
    "a harris current sheet is assumed , i.e. , @xmath6 , @xmath7 $ ] , @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , are dimensionless variables , and @xmath12 .",
    "we assume in the initial conditions that the current - sheet half - thickness @xmath13 .",
    "the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure is @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the initial gas pressure is @xmath10 outside the current sheet , and @xmath16 inside the current sheet .",
    "the total pressure is uniform .",
    "we assume @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the sound velocity and temperature are @xmath19 ( uniform ) and @xmath20 ( uniform ) .",
    "the initial alfvn velocity is @xmath21 ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we assume an anomalous resistivity model as follows : @xmath22 for @xmath23 , and @xmath24 for @xmath25 @xcite , where @xmath26(@xmath27 ) , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the relative ion - electron drift velocity , mass density , current density , and threshold above which the anomalous resistivity sets in ( anomalous resistivity originates from a lower hybrid instability , ion - acoustic instability , or ion - cyclotron instability ; see , e.g. , treumann 2001 ) .",
    "we also assume that the resistivity does not exceed @xmath31 . in this paper , we assume a `` background resistivity '' @xmath32 , which is sufficiently larger than the `` numerical resistivity '' because of the grid size @xcite .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we neglect the thermal radiation and heat conduction .",
    "they do not affect the basic properties of magnetic reconnection @xcite .",
    "we normalize the velocity , length , and time by the sound velocity ( @xmath35 ) , initial current - sheet thickness ( @xmath36 ) , and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the units of normalization are @xmath38 km s@xmath39 , @xmath40 km , and @xmath41 s. the units of temperature , density , gas pressure , and magnetic field strength are @xmath42 k , @xmath43 @xmath44 , @xmath45 erg @xmath44 , and @xmath46 g , respectively ( @xmath9 is @xmath47 g if we assume @xmath48 @xmath44 ) .",
    "the grid number is @xmath49 , and the grid size is uniform @xmath50 .",
    "we assume that the top ( @xmath51 ) and bottom ( @xmath52 ) surfaces are free boundaries , and that the right ( @xmath53 ) and left ( @xmath54 ) ones are periodic .",
    "the simulation box size is @xmath55 .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is @xmath56 .",
    "we use a 2-step modified lax - wendroff method .",
    "the resistivity is initially enhanced for a short time in the central region of the current sheet ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ shocks ] shows the time variation of the spatial distribution of the gas pressure in the reconnection region . the current sheet is unstable because of the tearing instability ( furth et al . 1963 ) .",
    "the magnetic dissipation time , alfvn time , and tearing instability time scale are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , respectively , where @xmath60 is the half thickness of the initial current sheet .",
    "the tearing instability is initiated in the current sheet by the initial perturbation .",
    "the current sheet becomes gradually thinner in the nonlinear phase of the tearing instability ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "its length is comparable to the most unstable wavelength of the tearing instability , i.e. , @xmath62 @xcite , where @xmath63 .",
    "@xmath64 is @xmath65 in this simulation .",
    "the current - sheet thickness in this phase is @xmath66 , i.e. , the current sheet corresponds to that of a sweet(1958)-parker(1957 ) sheet .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is @xmath67 in this phase .",
    "furthermore , re@xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "these values explain our results well .",
    "the sheet becomes very long so that it becomes unstable to the tearing instability again at @xmath70 ( referred to as the ",
    "secondary tearing instability  in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the secondary tearing instability starts just after the sweet - parker sheet is created on a time scale of @xmath71 .",
    "the drift velocity ( @xmath26 ) reaches a threshold ( @xmath30 ) at @xmath72 so that anomalous resistivity sets in .",
    "@xmath26 , however , remains a little larger than @xmath30 when @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ tearing]a shows that the magnetic islands are actually created at the diffusion region ( but plasmoids are difficult to represent clearly in figure [ shocks]a ) .",
    "the gaps between them ( @xmath74 ) are not consistent with the analytic solution of the secondary tearing instability in this model , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 , @xmath77 , and re@xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the current - sheet thickness becomes @xmath79 , where the magnetic reynolds number is re@xmath80 .",
    "this is because the analytic solution is in the large @xmath81 approximation regime .",
    "the drift velocity increases a great deal above the threshold at @xmath82 before the current sheet completes its collapse to a thickness of @xmath83 . because of the excitation of anomalous resistivity , non - steady petschek(1964)-like ( fast ) reconnection starts , and is accompanied by slow shocks . during fast reconnection ( @xmath84 )",
    ", the secondary tearing instability occurs in the dissipation region where the anomalous resistivity is enhanced .",
    "this diffusion region is well resolved numerically .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number is now @xmath85 . the wavelength and time scale of the secondary tearing instability are @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , provided we assume that the secondary tearing instability starts when @xmath88 .",
    "figure [ tearing]b also shows that the plasmoids are created at this time .",
    "their wavelengths are consistent with the above theoretical value .",
    "this result can be explained by extension of the results of @xcite , although the analytic solution is in the large @xmath81 approximation regime . due to the bursty , time - dependent reconnection ,",
    "many weak shocks are created in the reconnection jet .",
    "they are almost stationary , when they are created outside the diffusion region , although they move inside and near the diffusion region .",
    "figure [ profile ] displays the profiles of some variables in @xmath89 , when @xmath90 .",
    "the profiles show that 12 weak shocks are created among @xmath91 .",
    "hence , the gaps between them ( @xmath92 ) are quite consistent with @xmath93 ( note that the local alfvn velocity is smaller than @xmath94 during this phase ) . the reconnection jet can become supersonic and the pressure jumps are almost standing so that they could be shocks . the reconnection rate and inflow velocity toward the diffusion region oscillate . as a result ,",
    "the reconnection becomes `` turbulent '' @xcite during the late phase . in this phase , the kelvin - helmholtz instability may",
    "also occurs ( see discussion ) .",
    "we examine the dependence of the results on the plasma @xmath95 and resistivity model ( @xmath96 , @xmath30 , and @xmath97 ) .",
    "these parameters do not affect our principal results ; fast shocks are created in all simulations .",
    "for example , the physical values are @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 , @xmath64 @xmath102 @xmath103 @xmath104 , and @xmath105 @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 , respectively . furthermore , @xmath93 @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath111 @xmath112 , and @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 @xmath117 , if anomalous resistivity is assumed to be excited to @xmath118 when the current - sheet thickness is @xmath88 . a detailed investigation of the parameter - dependence",
    "will be published elsewhere .",
    "we suggest that bursty , time - dependent reconnection creates many weak shocks ( plasmoids ) in the reconnection jet , which could become multiple fast shocks in actual flares .",
    "reconnection produces an outflow whose velocity is comparable with the local sound speed .",
    "thus , it can create fast shocks which would provide sites for fermi acceleration . from our numerical simulations ,",
    "the number of energetic electrons can be determined by the flux into the internal shocks , and is calculated to be @xmath119 s@xmath39 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the reconnection site evolves in a self - similar manner @xcite , so the evidence of bursty reconnection and internal shocks shown in this paper may be observed by the _ solar - b _ satellite which will be launched in 2006 .",
    "if the energetic electrons are accelerated in the fast shocks , the number of energetic electrons would increase with distance from the diffusion region .",
    "our simulations show that the reconnection jet ( `` downflow '' ) produces turbulence .",
    "the turbulent field at the loop top helps to accelerate and confine the energetic electrons @xcite . as a second important application",
    ", we suggest that the non - steady ejection of plasmoids can create the internal shocks .",
    "they actually appear in some of our simulations with different parameters , which we will examine in a future paper .",
    "this could explain the oscillations @xcite and non - steady plasmoid ejections @xcite in the downflows .",
    "in fact , some results with different parameters show the oscillation and multiple oblique shocks in the jet , which could be due to the kelvin - helmholtz instability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , spatial patterns that are similar to the multiple oblique shocks appear in galactic jets ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the non - steady ejection and bow shock propagation can also play an important role in slowly drifting structures @xcite , and narrowband dm - spikes @xcite in the upward jet .",
    "the time scale for the tearing instability in the diffusion region is @xmath120 @xmath121 @xmath122 @xmath123 s if we assume spitzer conductivity and that the diffusion region thickness is @xmath124 .",
    "this explains the time scales associated with the above phenomena @xcite .",
    "our results can also be applied to particle acceleration in the galactic plane @xcite etc .",
