    "in particular , we have recognized that many networks have scale - free degree distribution , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the degree of nodes .",
    "the dynamics involved in complex networks has become an important aspect of the complex network studies in recent times .",
    "this problem includes , for example , the spreading of virus in the internet , synchronization of neurons in a brain , change of populations in a food web .",
    "recently , pastor - satorras and vespignani obtained unexpected results in this regard @xcite .",
    "they studied the spread of viruses in complex networks and found that no threshold of infection rate exists for the susceptible - infected - susceptible model in the random scale - free network with @xmath2 , if the size of the network @xmath3 is infinite .",
    "though real networks such as the internet are finite - size network , this result implies that a virus with a small infection rate can spread over the whole network .",
    "we had previously presented another remarkable example of the unusual dynamics involved in complex networks@xcite .",
    "we studied the kuramoto synchronization in a random network of oscillators and found that the critical coupling for synchronization becomes zero in scale - free network with @xmath2 .    in these studies",
    ", the mean - field approximation plays an essential role . for the mean - field approximation",
    ", we consider a model in which a node @xmath4 couples to another node @xmath5 with a strength proportional to `` mean coupling probability '' @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the degree of node @xmath4 and total number of edges , respectively .",
    "the dynamics in complex network is much simplified by this approximation , and we can obtain analytical results .",
    "however , this model differs from the original network model , in which each node couples to a finite number of nodes .",
    "it is remarkable that the mean - field approximation is in good agreement with the numerical simulation result of a random network model .",
    "one of the objectives of this paper is to provide a sound explanation for the mean - field approximation .",
    "it is unclear why the mean - field approximation performs well in the random network model .",
    "the validity of the mean - field approximation , particularly with regard to the kuramoto transition , is debatable .",
    "moreno , pacheko and vazquez - prada carried out numerical simulations on the kuramoto transition in the barabshi - albert network.@xcite .",
    "they concluded that the critical coupling @xmath9 is not 0 even if @xmath10 .",
    "their conclusion seems to contradict the result of mean - field theory @xmath11 , though this discrepancy is possibly due to the difference of the order parameter used in these papers .",
    "restrepo , hunt , and ott suggested that the the argument based on the largest eigenvalue of the network matrix is superior to that based on the mean - field theory@xcite .",
    "they demonstrated that the mean - field approximation is valid for erds - rnyi networks and random scale - free networks with @xmath12 , while this approximation does not hold in the case of scale - free networks with @xmath13 .",

    "the second objective of this study is to extend the mean - field theory .",
    "although the mean - field theory displays good qualitative coincidence with numerical simulation , it is impossible to examine the fluctuation of the variables by the mean - field approximation .",

    "therefore it is meaningful to make an approximation that covers a wider range of complex networks . in this paper , we demonstrate that the distribution of variables in the sparse random network model can be approximated by that obtained from a globally coupled network , in which the distribution of the interaction between the nodes is given by a gaussian random number .",
    "this result indicates that the dynamics in random network can be approximated more precisely by appropriate methods such as dynamical mean - field theory@xcite .    in order to realize the above - mentioned objectives , we utilize the path - integral approach .",
    "the path integral , which was originally developed for application in quantum mechanics@xcite , has also been applied to random impurity problems@xcite , random spin glasses@xcite , neural networks@xcite , and oscillator systems@xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of this approach is that the average over an ensemble of networks can be calculated easily",
    ". limitations of the path - integral include an infinite number of integrals and obtaining a precise average over the ensemble , which is not usually possible .",
    "however , this method enables approximation of the distribution of the variables in a systematic manner .",
    "in particular , the mean - field approximation can be derived as the lowest order approximation of the path integral .",

    "sequential application of the stratonovich - hubbard transformation yields the contribution from the term @xmath65 .",

    "there are several models , such as the replicator model@xcite , for which the exact results are known for a gaussian random network .",
    "our analysis proves that the dynamics of random sparse networks can be easily obtained for such models .",
    "the analysis presented in this study is limited to the dynamics in a random network model . in the case of another network model , we need to include the higher - order terms to evaluate the msr generating functional .",
    "it is usually difficult to carry out such a calculation .",
    "however , our result provide much informations regarding the validity of the mean - field approximation .",
    "for example , the mean - field approximation is applicable if @xmath184 . on the other hand ,",
    "such an approximation is not applicable to the dynamics of a highly clustered network .",
    "in such a network , @xmath185 , @xmath40 can not be assumed and the contribution from the neglected terms needs to be calculated .",
    "it is usually believed that the dynamics of networks with high clustering coefficients can not be approximated using the mean - field approximation method because of the high clustering coefficient .",
    "however , our analysis reveals that the validity of the mean - field approximation methods depends on the value of @xmath186 and @xmath33 .",
    "for example , the mean - field approximation method can not be applied to the square - lattice model even if the clustering coefficient is zero , because the value of @xmath187 can be as large as that of @xmath33 .",
    "we also discuss other studies conducted on the kuramoto transition in random network models .",
    "_ examined the mean - field theory and studied the kuramoto transition @xcite .",
    "they concluded that synchronization occurs when @xmath157 satisfies the relation @xmath188 , where @xmath189 is the largest eigenvalue of the network matrix @xmath142 and @xmath190 is the density of the oscillators at @xmath191 .",
    "they stated that the mean - field approximation , which was developed by us in previous papers , functions only when @xmath192 , where @xmath193 is the local field defined as @xmath194 , where @xmath195 means the average over a long time interval .",
    "however , they did not explain the reason why this assumption is valid some random network models , though they stated that there exists some relationship between the eigenvectors of @xmath142 and degree of each node .",
    "in this paper , we demonstrated that the mean - field theory is an approximation that considers only the term @xmath182 in the msr generating functional . in this case , the mean - field approximation coincides with the discussion obtained from the largest eigenvalues , because the largest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath196 is @xmath197 and its eigenvector @xmath198 is given by @xmath199 . in the random network model , @xmath200 , where @xmath7 and @xmath201 are the degrees of the nodes @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the largest eigenvalue of this matrix is @xmath202 , and the critical condition for synchronization in the mean - field approximation becomes identical to that in the discussion based on eigenvalues . in order to examine the applicability of the mean - field approximation ,",
    "the term @xmath60 should be considered . in the case of a random matrix , the largest eigenvalue with a dispersion @xmath203",
    "is expressed by @xmath204 based on wigner s semicircle law@xcite .",
    "this result suggests that the mean - field approximation can be applied if @xmath205 . in order to examine this",
    ", we consider the matrix @xmath206 , where @xmath207 is the matrix obtained from the mean - field approximation and @xmath208 the gaussian random matrix , i.e. , the distribution of each element of the matrix is gaussian with dispersion @xmath209 . as observed earlier , the largest eigenvector @xmath198 of matrix @xmath207 satisfies the condition @xmath210 , where @xmath211 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath212 is of the order @xmath213 , because all eigenvalues of @xmath208 lie between @xmath214 and @xmath215 .",
    "therefore , @xmath216 equals approximately @xmath217 based on the assumption that @xmath218 , and the direction of @xmath219 is approximately identical to @xmath198 .",
    "it should be noted that all vectors @xmath220 that are perpendicular to @xmath198 , i.e. , @xmath221 , satisfy the condition @xmath222 .",
    "this implies that @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the largest eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector of @xmath206 can be approximated as @xmath224 and @xmath225 , respectively .",
    "therefore , the mean - field approximation is a suitable approximation if @xmath226 is sufficiently large . in the case of a scale - free network ,",
    "the spectrum density differs from that suggested by wigner s law and the above - mentioned conclusion should be modified .",
    "however , this discussion suggests that the validity of the mean - field approximation is determined by the largest eigenvalues of the mean - field matrix @xmath207 and random matrix @xmath208 .",
    "if the largest eigenvalue of matrix @xmath208 is as large as @xmath189 , the mean - field approximation is not valid .",
    "based on the idea presented in this paper , the claim made by restrepo _",
    "implies that the term @xmath60 must be included in order to discuss the critical behavior more accurately , especially in the case of a scale - free network with @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , their work was not a denial of the mean - field theory , but an extension of it .",
