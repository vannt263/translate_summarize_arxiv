    "many models @xcite - @xcite have been proposed the describe the breakup of a large nucleus subjected to excitation energies greater than a few mev per nucleon , a process known as multifragmentation .",
    "experimentally , the signature of multifragmentation is the production of a wide range of nuclear reaction products , particularly intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) , @xmath0 .  on the basis of inclusive data ,",
    "it was proposed @xcite - @xcite that these fragments were produced in analogy to a liquid - to - gas phase transition occurring in a nucleus .  a recent experiment that permitted the total charge reconstruction of each event studied multifragmentation resulting from the breakup of gold nuclei as a function of the excitation energy deposited @xcite - @xcite .",
    "the statistical aspects of these data have provided strong evidence that multifragmentation is indeed related to a phase transition occurring in a finite system .  whether the production of imfs in such collisions is due to a phase transition , and",
    "if so , what type , is still an issue of much debate @xcite .",
    "one class of models developed to explore the fate of a nucleus as a function of excitation energy is based on the phenomenological description of the free energy , @xmath1 , of the breakup state , where @xmath2 is the common temperature of all nucleons and nuclei within the breakup volume @xmath3 .",
    "these nuclei are considered to be at normal nuclear density and interact only via the coulomb force .",
    "the distribution of nuclear fragments prior to any secondary decay can then be calculated as a first step in the disassembly of the excited initial system .  to compare with data , deexcitation of fragments and expansion of the system due to the coulomb repulsion between the fragments must be accounted for in the model .  however ,",
    "if the thermodynamics of the model is of interest , as is the case in this work , then only the behavior of thermodynamic variables need be examined , _",
    "e.g. _ free energy , entropy , specific heat , pressure , isothermal compressibility .",
    "thus , no fragment distributions need be explicitly calculated and therefore no fragment distributions are analyzed in this work .    here , several variations of a previously discussed model @xcite are explored .",
    "a canonical ensemble approach is used to investigate the thermodynamics of the system where the free energy , @xmath4 , is written as a function of the temperature , @xmath2 , and the volume , @xmath3 .",
    "calculations are restricted to a system which contains 162 constituent , since this is representative of the size of the system studied in @xcite .",
    "contributions to @xmath4 , _",
    "e.g. _ the surface free energy , the coulomb energy , are examined by turning them off or altering the form of the contribution in question .  in this way insight",
    "can be gained as to how the important features of the thermodynamics such as specific heat , isothermal compressibility , etc .",
    "depend on the parameterization of the free energy .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .  in section",
    "ii the details of the models are presented .",
    "three versions of a standard statistical multifragmentation model are examined as well as a well - known mean field model whose results are used for comparison .   in section",
    "iii a description of the analysis and the results of that analysis are presented .",
    "section iv discusses the standard interpretations of the models and analysis .  finally , a brief discussion of the questions raised by this work concludes this paper .  in general , the notation of references @xcite and",
    "@xcite are followed .",
    "this work follows directly the efforts presented in reference @xcite in which the canonical partition function was examined as a function of temperature in a fixed volume system for evidence of a phase transition .  in that work , evidence for a first order phase transition",
    "was found .  in the present work , the volume ( average density ) of the system is permitted to vary .",
    "it shall be seen that the nature of the phase transition depends on the volume of the system .",
    "the work of @xcite is also extended by examining the effects of the coulomb force on the system and the effects of the choice of surface energy parameterizations .",
    "the units used for the nuclear models are : energy and free energy in mev / nucleon , temperature in mev , volume in @xmath5 , pressure in mev@xmath6@xmath5 and so on .",
    "a general description of each system follows .",
    "calculations begin by considering the free energy of a nuclear fragment .",
    "it is assumed @xcite that the free energy of a nuclear fragment of mass @xmath7 and charge @xmath8 , for @xmath9 is given by : @xmath10 the terms in eq .",
    "( [ f_az ] ) refer to the bulk , symmetry , surface and coulomb contributions to the free energy of a nuclear fragment .",
    "the forms of these terms are given @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_b ] ) the constants are taken as @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev .  in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_sym ] ) @xmath17 mev .  in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_s ] ) @xmath18 mev and @xmath19 mev , following reference @xcite .",
    "the contribution from the coulomb term is estimated via a wigner - seitz approximation as in reference @xcite .",
    "the @xmath20-term is related to the volume of the system through @xmath21 this simplified model presented here differs from the standard version @xcite in that there is only one parameter relating the volume excluded by the constituents , @xmath22 , to the total volume of the system , @xmath3 , and to the free volume , @xmath23 .",
    "here the free volume is the difference between the total volume @xmath3 and the sum of the volume of the fragments , assumed to be at normal nuclear density , and is the volume available for the translational motion of the fragments .    in the standard version of the model",
    "the free volume is given by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is parameterized to increase with fragment multiplicity such that it varies between @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the parameter @xmath20 is fixed , usually at @xmath28 .",
    "for simplicity , here it is assumed that @xmath29 so that specifying @xmath23 determines the value of @xmath20 in eq .",
    "( [ kappa ] ) .",
    "see reference @xcite for details of @xmath20 and @xmath25 in the standard version .",
    "for this work then , the total volume of the system is then given by : @xmath30 two things become obvious from eq .",
    "( [ v_f ] ) ; first , with this form of @xmath3 the free energy of the system varies with @xmath23 since @xmath22 is a constant .",
    "second , the loss of free volume in the closest packing of spherical clusters is ignored .",
    "the issue of whether spherical nuclei can actually be placed in a total volume , @xmath22 , given a free volume , @xmath23 , is not addressed .",
    "undoubtedly , there will be situations where it is not possible for the total volume to accommodate all of the nuclear clusters .",
    "the purpose here , however , is to explore the thermodynamics and self - consistency of the model and not physical consistency .",
    "finally @xmath31 is the radius of the fragment in question and is determined by @xmath32 with @xmath33 fm .",
    "the version of the model presented above will be termed v1 .    from this point",
    "the intrinsic partition function of a fragment of @xmath7 , @xmath8 at temperature @xmath2 and volume @xmath3 can be determined @xcite as follows : @xmath34 using a technique developed in reference @xcite and used on a simplified version of this model @xcite , the canonical partition function can be built via a recursion relation : @xmath35 starting from @xmath36 .  here for calculational simplicity the approximation has been made that for each and every fragment with @xmath9 , @xmath37 which represents an average mass to charge ratio for fragments .",
    "the @xmath38 term is @xmath39 where the terms the the left of the fragment partition function , @xmath40 , account for the translational free energy contribution , @xmath41 .",
    "it is now straightforward to calculate the partition function of the system for a given @xmath2 , @xmath23 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the free energy of the system of @xmath44-particles is then determined as usual @xmath45 where the last term is the usual coulomb contribution of a uniformly charged sphere : @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "the model and calculations described above were compared to the full , or unmodified version of the model often cited in the literature , see for example references @xcite , @xcite - @xcite .",
    "see figure 1 .  in figure 1",
    "results from the full version of this model are shown for the mean fragment distribution calculated at a given input excitation energy .  to generate event - by - event distributions poissonian fluctuations about the mean",
    "are introduced , after which , temperature is adjusted to ensure energy conservation .",
    "to more fully recover the standard version of the model most often used , higher order corrections were introduced just as in the full version of the model ; _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath48 in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_b ] ) was made dependent on the fragment mass @xmath7 , for light clusters , @xmath49 , the empirical masses and binding energies , radii and spin degeneracy factors of the ground state were used , the total volume was held constant at @xmath50 and the free volume was set to depend on the input excitation energy .",
    "finally , energy was explicitly conserved ; an input excitation energy was given and a temperature was determined such that total energy was conserved .",
    "the explicit conservation of energy produced results that were essentially the same as those resulting from the unconstrained canonical ensemble .",
    "[ ht ]    figure 1a shows the caloric curve from the full version of this model for a system with 100 nucleons ( 60 neutrons and 40 protons ) compared to the same size system used in calculations with a modified version of v1 .",
    "the general trend of the modified v1 reproduced the average behavior of the full model , though there is not a perfect agreement .",
    "this is to be expected .",
    "while this modified version of v1 is closer to the model , there are still some differences , _",
    "e.g. _ the charge of @xmath51 fragment is treated in only an average fashion in v1 .",
    "the reproduction of the general trends indicates that v1 captures the essence of the full model .",
    "figure 1b shows the fragment multiplicity , before any secondary decay , from both models .",
    "again there is general agreement between the two .",
    "the break observed in the caloric curve shown in figure 1 is well known in the full model , see , for example , figure 4 in ref .",
    "@xcite and figure 11 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the break is due to the initial guess of the system s multiplicity which is in turn used to guess the system s free volume .  for low energies",
    "the multiplicity is chosen to be 1 , 2 or 3 ( figure 1b shows that the initial guess of the multiplicity is consistent with the final state multiplicity ) , while at higher energies the multiplicity depends smoothly on a function of the input excitation energy @xcite .  in some systems , _",
    "e.g. _ a system of 100 nucleons , there is a jump in multiplicity at the transition from the low energy computations and the high energy computations which gives rise to a jump in the final state multiplicity , figure 1b , and a break in the caloric curve , figure 1a .",
    "when the simplified model used in this work is given the same volume dependence as the full model , the results of the full model are reproduced .",
    "energy conservation is explored in figure 2 .  here",
    "the unmodified version of v1 was used with a system of 162 particles and energy was explicitly conserved as outlined above .  in order to examine the change in energy between the initial and final state of each term contributing to the system s total energy ,",
    "the temperature of the initial state of the system has been calculated corresponding to the input @xmath52 .",
    "the assumption that the initial nuclear state is in thermal equilibrium prior to its deexcitation to the final state has no bearing on the thermodynamics of the final state and is done only for purposes of the abovementioned calculation .",
    "the initial state used for this calculation was the system of 162 nucleons at excitation energy , @xmath52 , at normal nuclear density , @xmath53 and at a temperature that conserves energy when the total energy is determined using eqns ( [ f_az_b])-([e_az_c ] ) , ( [ f_tot ] ) and : @xmath54 the total energy of the initial state is shown in figure 2 as well as it s various components and a caloric curve .  the final state of the system was computed with the same @xmath52 but was held at a third normal density , @xmath55 , and allowed to fragment in the manner outlined above .",
    "the caloric curve produced for the final state via this explicit conservation of energy calculation is identical to the caloric curve produced via the calculations without an explicit conservation of energy .",
    "figure 2 shows that the temperature in the final state is lower than that in the initial state .",
    "further inspection indicates that while the coulomb energy is reduced by creating smaller charged nuclei , the energy required to create the additional surface area more is more than offsetting .",
    "thus , the temperature must decrease .",
    "[ ht ]      the general ideas of v1 are followed but with the coulomb energy of the system set to zero .  the free energy shown in eq .",
    "( [ f_az ] ) then becomes : @xmath56 and the total free energy of the system is given by @xmath57 every other aspect of the model is the same as in v1 .",
    "this version of the model will be termed v2 .      in this version , the coulomb force is suppressed and the temperature dependent surface term in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_s ] ) is made independent of temperature : @xmath58 the free energy of a fragment and the entire system are still given by eqns ( [ f_a_v2 ] ) and ( [ f_tot_v2 ] ) .",
    "every other aspect of the model is the same as in v1 and v2 .",
    "this version of the model will be termed v3 .",

    "this also suggested the value of @xmath66 in @xmath67 .  finally , eq . ( [ fe_vdw ] )",
    "was evaluated in terms of @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the van der waals fluid model is well defined ad free of internal inconsistencies .",
    "it will be used as a benchmark for the analysis presented in this paper .",
    "units for the van der waals fluid results will be in ev@xmath70 for energy and free energy , ev@xmath71 for pressure and so on .",
    "calculations were performed for each version of the model to determine @xmath72 for @xmath73 , @xmath74 and over a range in temperature , @xmath75 mev @xmath76 mev , and volume of @xmath77 @xmath78 .",
    "once the general vicinity of the critical point was identified , a smaller range in @xmath79 was used for more detailed calculations .  for the van der waals fluid the range was smaller and in terms of reduced temperature and volume : @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "figure 3 shows the behavior of the free energy over the ranges of temperature and volume used in the calculations .",
    "[ ht ]    after the value of the free energy was calculated , it was simple to determine other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "holding the volume fixed the entropy is given by the usual relation : @xmath82 in the case of this work differences were used instead of derivatives due to the numerical nature of the calculation , thus eq .",
    "( [ entropy1 ] ) becomes @xmath83 similarly the specific heat at constant volume was determined via @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the average value of @xmath2 over the @xmath86 interval .",
    "using the entropy and the free energy , the total energy can be determined from : @xmath87    in these calculations it was possible to hold either the temperature or the volume constant .",
    "the pressure was then found by holding the temperature fixed @xmath88 taking another _ derivative _ then gave the isothermal compressibility @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the average value of @xmath23 over the @xmath91 interval .  with this information it is possible to determine if there is a phase transition in a model such as this and , if present , the nature of that phase transition .",
    "the following section addresses this question .",
    "in this section , each of the axes of the standard phase diagram , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath92 , will in turn be held fixed .",
    "the behavior of other quantities will be examined in order to understand the behavior of each system .",
    "the van der waals fluid will serve as a guide for the interpretation of the analysis and also as a benchmark to illustrate the accuracy of this analysis .",
    "determination of the critical point , coexistence and spinodal curves is discussed below .",
    "the variation of the free energy as a function of density shows the same general features for these systems .",
    "[ ht ]    figure 4 shows the behavior of the free energy isotherms for each system as function of reduced density .",
    "each plot in figure 3 shows three isotherms .",
    "the isotherms are sub - critical ( @xmath93 ) , critical ( @xmath94 ) and super - critical ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "determination of the critical point is discussed below .  also shown",
    "are the approximate location of the coexistence and spinodal curves .",
    "determination of these curves is also discussed below .",
    "the behavior of the free energy for these isotherms for all systems is more or less the same .  as the reduced density increases , the free energy increases .  at some mid range in reduced density the slope of the increase in free energy changes .  at a greater reduced density the slope of the increase in free energy changes again .",
    "this is most clearly demonstrated by the van der waals fluid system .",
    "see figure 4d .  however , the behavior is present in all the models .",
    "this behavior , while appearing modest in these plots , will be seen to be the cause of the critical - like behavior exhibited by these models .",
    "[ ht ]    the pressure was calculated from the free energy isotherms via eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "figure 5 shows the results for each model .",
    "the determination of the location of the critical point and the coexistence and spinodal curves is based on the phase diagram of pressure , temperature and reduced density .  by searching for inflections points along the pressure versus reduced density isotherms the spinodal curve was determined .",
    "the isotherm immediately following , as the temperature of each isotherm increases , the last isotherm with two inflection points was labeled the critical isotherm .    another method to determine the location of the critical point began with the isothermal compressibility which was calculated with eq .",
    "( [ iso_comp ] ) .",
    "isotherms of @xmath96 versus reduced density were inspected .",
    "all sub - critical isotherms showed at least one negative value of @xmath96 .",
    "the first isotherm , as a function of increasing temperature , which showed only positive values of @xmath96 was labeled the critical isotherm .",
    "both procedures yielded the same results , as they are essentially identical .",
    "see table i.    the coexistence curve was determined by making a maxwell equal area construction for each isotherm .",
    "see figure 4 for examples of the maxwell construction .    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "it has been shown that the type of nuclear model discussed here exhibits many features commonly associated with a system in which critical phenomena are present , _ e.g. _ a coexistence curve , power laws , critical exponents .  by removing both the coulomb and temperature - dependent free energy terms , it was found that the appearance of a critical point in these models is due to the interplay between the surface , volume , and translational free energy terms",
    ".  however , these types of models are not without inconsistencies .",
    "one striking inconsistency is the fact that the temperature dependent surface free energy gives rise to a infinite negative specific heat at the critical temperature used by the model .",
    "furthermore , no version of the model showed a critical temperature that agreed with the one explicitly input into the surface free energy term .",
    "additionally , when the surface term was rendered temperature independent the critical point remained .  thus suggesting that the appearance of a critical point in these models is not dependent on the temperature dependence of the surface term but rather is a result of the interplay between the surface and volume free energy terms .",
    "the critical temperature and density have been determined by examining isotherms in the @xmath97 plane .  in the neighborhood of this critical point , singular behavior characterized by power laws was observed .",
    "however , these critical exponents do not obey well known scaling relations .",
    "this is a particularly troublesome occurrence as any model with true critical behavior , even the simple van der waals fluid , does have exponents which obey these scaling relations .",
    "it is possible that an examination of this model for larger systems , with smaller steps in temperature and volume in the calculation of the free energy , will yield a consistent set of critical exponents .",
    "it is important to note that the critical densities found here are much higher than could be realized with a closest packing of normal density nuclei .  additionally , these critical densities are significantly higher than those typically used to compare model predictions @xcite , @xcite to data .",
    "a major conclusion of this work is that the particular phenomenological description of the free energy of a hot nucleus leads to several inconsistencies regarding both temperature and density .",
    "it was pointed out that the parameterization of the surface free energy leads to a negative and divergent contribution to the specific heat at @xmath2 approaches the value of the parameter @xmath98 in eq .",
    "( [ f_az_s ] ) .",
    "furthermore , all values of the critical temperature found from examination of isotherms in the @xmath92-@xmath99 plane are much below this parameter value .",
    "thus , while use of such a model may well lead to an excellent description of multifragmentation data , the lack of internal consistency noted here makes the interpretation of data in terms of the model problematic .",
    "such agreement may rest more on the phase space sampling and variable free volume inherent in the model than on the finer details examined here .",
    "finally , it has been shown that the variable volume version of this phenomenological model of multifragmentation exhibits caloric curves which can be misinterpreted in the absence of detailed knowledge of the complete thermodynamic phase diagram .",
