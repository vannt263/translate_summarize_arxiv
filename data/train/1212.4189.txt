    "the mechanisms that induce magnetic activity in field stars have been intensively studied and discussed over the last decades and this effort is now converging in a fairly consistent scenario that explains both magnetic field generation and angular momentum evolution in both partially and fully convective stars .",
    "magnetic fields in partially convective ( f , g , k and early m ) stars are believed to be generated at the transition region between the radiative interior and the differentially rotating outer convective zone ( tachocline ) through a solar - type @xmath3 dynamo . in this scenario",
    "magnetic fields are generated as a result of a combination of differential rotation ( @xmath4 effect ) and cyclonic convection ( @xmath5 effect ) @xcite .",
    "lower mass m dwarfs of spectral type later than @xmath6m3 are fully convective and therefore do not posses a tachocline , however display clear signs of magnetic activity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "such stars are suggested to rotate as rigid bodies @xcite , implying that the @xmath3 dynamo can not be responsible for producing magnetic fields .",
    "instead , an @xmath7 dynamo has been proposed for magnetic field generation in fully convective stars @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of both the @xmath3 dynamo and the @xmath7 dynamo are expected to be strongly correlated with the rossby number ( * ? ? ?",
    "* @xmath8 , with @xmath9 the rotational period and @xmath10 the convective overturn timescale ) . in partially convective stars magnetic",
    "activity rises for decreasing rossby numbers , implying that larger rotational velocities lead to higher levels of magnetic activity ( for a given @xmath10 , * ? ? ?",
    "similarly , a correlation between activity and rotation is also expected in fully convective stars in which magnetic fields may be generated by the @xmath7 dynamo @xcite .",
    "several early observational studies have explored the connection between magnetic activity and rotation @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite showed that the x - ray emission increases with rotation for slowly rotating stars but saturates below a threshold of @xmath11 .",
    "the same relation seems to apply for the magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the phenomenon of saturation is not fully understood yet , one possible explanation is that saturation occurs due to a change of dynamo configuration @xcite .",
    "an additional explanation is that saturation is reached when a certain maximum fraction of the available energy flux ( from convection ) is converted into magnetic energy @xcite . for ultracool dwarfs of spectral type m7 - 9.5 this clear rotation - activity relation , however , seems to be no longer valid @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has to be stressed that rotation and magnetic activity in single ( late - type ) m dwarfs might not always be linked @xcite .",
    "rotation and magnetic activity decrease in time @xcite as a consequence of magnetic braking , i.e. angular momentum is extracted from the convective envelope and lost through a magnetized wind .",
    "the braking timescales strongly depend on the spectral type ( or mass ) of the star @xcite , which results in lower - mass partially convective stars spinning - down slower than their higher mass counterparts .",
    "fully convective stars have even longer rotational braking timescales @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the reason for magnetic braking being less efficient in fully convective stars is not completely understood .",
    "this might be related to a change in the magnetic field topology , which has been observed to switch from less ordered field structures to dipoles at the fully convective boundary going from partially to fully convective stars @xcite .",
    "however such a switch should lead to increased magnetic braking for fully convective stars , exactly opposite to what is indicated by the observed rotation rates .",
    "a new scenario for magnetic braking has been recently developed by @xcite who suggest that the steep transition of the braking rates at the fully convective boundary arises due to the significant drop in radius , without invoking any change in the dynamo theory .",
    "m dwarf companions to white dwarfs that form part of detached binaries ( hereafter wd / dm binaries ) offer an ideal test bed for studying magnetic activity , rotation and magnetic braking across the fully convective boundary for three reasons .",
    "( 1 ) wd / dm binaries can easily be separated into wide binaries with orbital periods typically exceeding @xmath12days , and close binaries that evolved through common envelope evolution @xcite with final orbital periods generally below one day @xcite . while the m dwarfs in wide binaries should be unaffected by the presence of the white dwarf , those in close post - common envelope binaries ( pcebs ) are tidally locked , i.e. they are rapidly rotating .",
    "comparing the two samples can provide clear constraints on the impact of fast rotation on activity .",
    "( 2 ) using pcebs with measured orbital periods one can furthermore directly relate the strength of activity to the rotational velocity of the m dwarf ( the orbital period of the binary equals to the rotational period of the m dwarf which then gives the rotational velocity by adopting a spectral type - radius relation ) .",
    "( 3 ) the age of the m dwarfs in wide wd / dm systems can be estimated relatively accurately using cooling tracks plus an initial - to - final mass relation for their white dwarf companions .",
    "this allows to test activity lifetimes that are presumably related to magnetic braking models .",
    "the first studies of magnetic activity in m dwarfs that form part of wd / dm binaries from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were performed by @xcite and more recently by @xcite .",
    "however , these two studies consider all wd / dm binaries in sdss to be part of close binaries , which is clearly not the case @xcite , and their results should be interpreted with extreme caution .",
    "only our dedicated radial velocity survey of wd / dm binaries from sdss allows to accurately separate wide binaries ( in which the stellar components have evolved as if they were single ) from close binaries that underwent a common envelope evolution and therefore contain tidally locked fast rotating m dwarfs @xcite .",
    "this is fundamental to explore the relation between activity and rotation .",
    "the largest and most homogeneous sample of wd / dm binaries from sdss including radial velocity information has been presented in @xcite .",
    "this sample forms the input for the present paper where we analyse the magnetic activity of m dwarf components in wd / dm binaries , thereby testing possible relations between age , activity and rotation .",
    "the catalogue of @xcite consists of 2248 white dwarf - main sequence binaries from the data release 7 ( dr7 ) of sdss , of which 2019 contain an m dwarf ( wd / dm binaries ) .",
    "the sdss wd / dm binary sample is described in more detail in this section .",
    "we begin introducing our radial velocity survey that allows to separate between close and wide binaries .",
    "we then explain how sdss wd / dm binary spectra can be used for obtaining reliable stellar parameters of both components and finally give indications of how we estimate the ages of our systems .",
    "the population of wd / dm binaries contains close binaries ( post - common envelope binaries or pcebs ) that underwent common envelope evolution @xcite , and wide binaries that never interacted .",
    "the m dwarfs that form part of pcebs are tidally locked and are therefore fast rotators .",
    "the properties of the m dwarfs that are part of wide binaries should resemble those of single m dwarfs as the stellar components in wide wd / dm binaries have evolved as if they were single stars @xcite .    to characterize large samples of both close pcebs and wide wd / dm binaries we are performing a large radial velocity follow - up program of sdss wd / dm binaries .",
    "our observing strategy follows a two - step procedure . in a first step",
    "we obtain at least two spectra per target , separated by at least one night , and identify systems as pcebs if the radial velocities we measure from these spectra show more than 3@xmath13 radial velocity variation .",
    "if we do not detect significant radial velocity variation , we consider the system as a wide wd / dm binary candidate .",
    "this technique is obviously less sensitive towards the detection of long orbital period pcebs and/or low - inclination systems and we predict that , on average , @xmath616 per cent of the wide wd / dm binary candidates are in fact unrecognised pcebs @xcite . in a second step , the orbital periods of the pcebs identified in this way are measured from higher cadence radial velocity follow - up .    so far we have identified 191 pcebs and 1055 wide wd / dm binary candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and have measured the orbital periods of 81 pcebs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these samples of wide and close wd / dm binaries offer the potential to e.g. directly compare activity fractions of slowly and fast rotating m dwarfs as a function of spectral type .",
    "furthermore , the rotational velocities of the m dwarfs in pcebs with known orbital periods can also be known ( assuming a spectral type - radius relation ) .",
    "these m dwarfs are very fast rotators and should populate the saturated regime , therefore allowing us to test the saturation - type rotation - activity relation .",
    "reliable stellar parameters of the wd / dm binaries are obtained from the sdss spectra using our decomposition / fitting routine @xcite .",
    "the sdss spectrum is initially fitted with a two - component model using a grid of observed m - dwarf templates and a grid of observed white dwarf templates ( see figure[f - norm1 ] ) , and the spectral type of the m dwarf is determined . then , the best - fit m dwarf template , scaled by the appropriate flux scaling factor , is subtracted and the residual white dwarf spectrum is fitted with a model grid of da white dwarfs @xcite to determine the white dwarf effective temperature and surface gravity . from an empirical spectral type - radius - mass relation for",
    "m - dwarfs @xcite and a mass - radius relation for white dwarfs @xcite the masses and radii of the m dwarf and the white dwarf components are calculated .    in the context of the present paper the spectral types of the m - dwarfs are of fundamental importance .",
    "we therefore compared the spectral types of our template fitting routine with those obtained by @xcite .",
    "fitting several hundred m dwarfs from the list of @xcite , equally distributed in spectral type , with our m dwarf templates and adopting an uncertainty of half a spectral type sub - class , we find that 98 per cent of our spectral classifications agree with those of @xcite within one spectral subclass .",
    "for a given mass , the magnetic activity of m dwarfs is closely related to their rotational velocity ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "if other effects , such as a close companion , do not affect the star , magnetic braking is slowing down the rotation with time .",
    "the magnetic activity in our sample of m dwarfs that form part of wide sdss wd / dm binaries should therefore primarily depend on the age of the system .",
    "fortunately , for a given wide wd / dm binary one can estimate the age of the system , and consequently the age of the m dwarf companion , by summing the white dwarf cooling age to its main sequence progenitor lifetime .",
    "sdss wd / dm binary ages were previously calculated by @xcite for a sub - sample of sdss wd / dm binaries .",
    "we estimate the ages for the wide sdss wd / dm binary sample studied in this work ( section[s - ident ] ) following the same strategy .    the white dwarf cooling ages were calculated using the evolutionary tracks of of @xcitebergeron / coolingmodels/ ] .",
    "the initial main sequence progenitor masses were calculated using the initial - to - final mass relation by @xcite and we used the equations of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see their appendix ) to calculate their main sequence lifetime . in this exercise we excluded wide wd / dm binaries containing white dwarfs cooler than 12000k , as the white dwarf spectral fitting overestimates the mass in such systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which affects the resulting cooling age .",
    "for the same reason we only determined the age of wide wd / dm binaries if the error of the mass of the white dwarf is smaller than @xmath14 , and given that the initial - to - final mass relation is only well defined for systems with white dwarfs masses @xmath150.55@xmath16 , we only considered wide wd / dm binaries containing white dwarfs with masses above this value .",
    "in the context of this paper it is necessary to unambiguously identify both active and inactive m dwarfs among the sdss wd / dm binary catalogue described in section[s - cat ] .",
    "two features have been predominantly used as activity indicators in optical spectroscopy , namely the caii h and k resonance lines and h@xmath5 emission .",
    "h@xmath5 emission is more accessible in wd / dm binaries because the caii h and k lines fall at wavelengths generally dominated by the flux of the white dwarf .",
    "we therefore consider a given m dwarf component as active if h@xmath5 emission is detected in its sdss spectrum .",
    "we developed an automatic routine for this purpose that is described below .    in a first step",
    "the best white dwarf model fit ( see section[s - param ] , figure[f - norm1 ] ) is subtracted from the sdss wd / dm binary spectrum . in order to avoid our results being dominated by low quality data , only residual m dwarf spectra with a signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of at least @xmath15 10 are used3 was used , however the activity fractions ( see details in section[s - frac ] ) we obtained for late - type m dwarfs where very much affected by low - quality data , and we therefore decided to increase the s / n threshold to a least @xmath1510 . ] , which results in a sample of 739 objects .",
    "for these 739 systems the continuum flux of the residual m dwarf around h@xmath5 ( 6420 @xmath17 6700 ) is fitted with a parabola ( excluding the range ha-7@xmath18 ha@xmath19 , where ha@xmath20 ) .",
    "the parabolic fit is then used to normalize the spectrum .",
    "examples are shown in figure[f - norm2 ] . once the spectrum is normalized , the equivalent width of h@xmath5 ( ew@xmath1 ) is calculated within the range ha-7@xmath21 ha@xmath19 ( emission in our case is indicated by a negative ew ) .",
    "active m dwarfs are then selected applying the following criteria :    @xmath22    where eew@xmath1 is the ew@xmath1 error , h is the peak of the h@xmath5 emission above the continuum level , and n@xmath23 is the noise at continuum level .",
    "an m dwarf is considered inactive if , conversely , any of the following conditions apply :    @xmath24    the above procedure results in 373 active and 366 inactive m dwarfs among the 739 sdss wd / dm binaries that form our final sample ( note that for objects with multiple sdss exposures we consider as active those systems for which h@xmath5 emission is detected in at least one of the sdss available m dwarf residual spectra ) .",
    "visual inspection of the active and inactive samples confirms the efficiency of our method , with only three per cent of miss - classifications .",
    "note that these miss - classifications are due to the fact that we are subtracting the white dwarf contribution from the sdss spectra , which may introduce uncertainties in the residual flux of the m dwarf if the white dwarf dominates the spectral energy distribution of the sdss wdms binary .",
    "examples of active and inactive m dwarf residual spectra are shown in the bottom panels of figure[f - norm2 ] .    from our radial velocity survey ( section[s - sample ] ) we identify 63 pcebs and 599 wide wd / dm binaries among the 739 systems .",
    "ages are available for 118 of the 599 wide binaries ( section[s - age ] ) .",
    "sdss single m dwarf activity fractions have been published by @xcite for different sdss data releases ( dr4 , dr5 and dr7 respectively ) , as well for independent ( non - sdss ) m dwarf samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "all show the same general trend , i.e. a significant increase of the fraction of active systems going from partially to fully convective stars .",
    "the m dwarf activity fractions of our 739 sdss wd / dm binaries as a function of spectral type are shown on the left panel of figure[f - frac ] ( black dots ) together with the activity fractions obtained by @xcite for single m dwarfs from the sdss .",
    "the two distributions differ significantly at early - to - mid ( m0 - 4 ) spectral types . at first glance",
    "this difference may not seem entirely surprising , as a significant fraction of wd / dm binaries are in fact close pcebs containing rapidly rotating m dwarfs and , as outlined in the introduction , fast rotation induces magnetic activity .",
    "one might therefore speculate , as e.g. @xcite and @xcite , that the increased activity fraction of wd / dm binaries containing early - to - mid spectral type m dwarfs is caused by a fraction of short orbital period pcebs .",
    "however , we have shown that very few wd / dm binaries containing early type m dwarfs ( @xmath25m3 ) are pcebs @xcite , i.e. the majority of these pcebs have evolved towards shorter orbital periods due to angular momentum loss via magnetic braking and entered a semi - detached configuration becoming cataclysmic variables @xcite .",
    "therefore the fraction of pcebs misclassified as wide systems in our radial velocity survey should be low in this spectral type range too .",
    "clearly , the observed activity fraction does not only depend on the rotational velocities but also on the intrinsic ages of the m dwarfs .",
    "therefore , to understand the measured activity fractions requires to separately investigate close pcebs and wide wd / dm binaries , and to take into account the ages of the latter population .",
    "the sdss pceb orbital period distribution peaks at @xmath68 hours @xcite , and the longest sdss pceb orbital period is slightly below 10 days @xcite .",
    "consequently m dwarfs in sdss pcebs are tidally locked @xcite and are expected to be magnetically active .",
    "the middle panel of figure[f - frac ] shows that all m dwarfs within sdss pcebs are active independently of the spectral type .",
    "one might be inclined to interpret this result as an obvious consequence of rotation causing activity , nevertheless it is important to keep in mind that h@xmath5 emission in pcebs may arise from irradiation effects if the white dwarf is relatively hot and/or the pceb orbital period is relatively short ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , we investigate below the effect of irradiation present among the 63 pcebs in our sample . for 47 of these pcebs",
    "the orbital periods are well known and the stellar parameters relatively well constrained @xcite . with this information at hand",
    "we can easily estimate the influence of irradiation by calculating the ratio between the intrinsic flux of the m dwarf ( f@xmath26 ) and the irradiating flux from the white dwarf on the m dwarf s surface ( f@xmath27 ) ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the m dwarf and white dwarf effective temperatures respectively , @xmath31 is the white dwarf radius , and @xmath32 is the orbital separation .",
    "the resulting f@xmath26/f@xmath27 ratios are shown in figure[f - ratio ] as a function of white dwarf effective temperature ( top panel ) and orbital period ( bottom panel ) . among the 47 pcebs , eight were followed - up photometrically as part of our survey ( section[s - sample ] ) and",
    "inspection of their light curves reveals clear irradiation effects in only two objects ( red solid triangles in figure[f - ratio ] , cyan dots represent the remaining six systems ) . based on the evidence drawn from these eight pcebs",
    "we define f@xmath33 f@xmath27 as the threshold separating systems dominated by irradiation from those that are dominated by the intrinsic emission of the m dwarf ( horizontal gray dashed line in figure[f - ratio ] ) .",
    "93 per cent of our systems lie above this limit and are presumably unaffected by irradiation . although the limit defined in that way just represents an empirically motivated estimate , we conclude that irradiation induced h@xmath5 plays a minor role for our sample of pcebs and that _ all m dwarfs in pcebs are magnetically active_.     the m dwarf intrinsic flux / white dwarf irradiated flux ratio ( f@xmath26/f@xmath27 ) as a function of white dwarf effective temperature ( top ) and orbital period ( bottom ) .",
    "the horizontal gray dashed line represents f@xmath34 f@xmath27 and is adopted to be the maximum limit for irradiation effects to be strong enough for h@xmath5 to be in emission .",
    "red solid triangles represent confirmed pcebs showing signs of irradiation effects in their light curves , cyan solid dots pcebs displaying no signs of irradiation in their light curves .",
    "the large errors obtained for several of our systems are a simple consequence of propagating relatively large uncertainties on the estimated effective temperatures @xcite .",
    "]      it is generally accepted that the stellar components in wide wd / dm binaries have evolved in the same way as if they were single stars @xcite .",
    "consequently the properties of the m dwarf companions in such binaries should be fairly similar to those of single m dwarfs , and naively one would expect similar activity fractions in both populations .",
    "this is clearly not the case ( see the right panel of figure[f - frac ] ) .",
    "the larger activity fractions detected in our sample must be caused by the fact that these m dwarfs are part of binary systems , but as these binaries are fairly wide ( @xmath35days , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , interactions between the two stars can be excluded to to be the cause of the increased activity fractions . as mentioned in section[s - sample ]",
    ", our radial velocity survey suffers from observational biases and we expect a small percentage of the wide wd / dm binary sample to be formed by unrecognised pcebs . it is therefore important to evaluate whether this effect can explain the increase of the activity fractions seen in m dwarfs that are part of wide wd / dm binaries as compared to those of single m dwarfs .",
    "for this purpose we calculate in what follows the pceb contamination in our wide wd / dm binary sample at a given spectral type . the exact number of unrecognised pcebs depends on the spectral type of the m dwarf components .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the observed fraction of pcebs containing early - type m dwarfs is @xmath610 per cent at m0 - 1 spectral types , and increases to only @xmath620 per cent at m2 . combining these fractions with the pceb detection probability of our radial velocity survey of @xmath60.8 @xcite",
    "we calculate a pceb contamination of less than five per cent in the m0 - 2 range ( where the activity fractions most differ ) .",
    "therefore this effect can certainly not explain the difference between the activity fractions in the single and wide wd / dm binary samples ( right panel of figure[f - frac ] ) .",
    "identifying both components in a sdss wd / dm binary spectrum requires that neither the white dwarf nor the m dwarf completely outshines the other component .",
    "cold white dwarfs are too faint to be detected in binaries with early - type m dwarfs .",
    "this implies the white dwarf to have an effective temperature @xmath36k thus excluding the coolest ( i.e. oldest ) white dwarfs @xcite . ) .",
    "these two effects result in no systems with m01 m dwarf components being included in the pceb sample studied in this work ( figure[f - frac ] , middle panel ) . ]",
    "the mass distribution of white dwarfs in wide wd / dm binaries is similar to the mass distribution of single white dwarfs @xcite implying that the progenitors of such white dwarfs were mainly f stars that spent a rather short time on the main sequence .",
    "in other words , the simple requirement that we need to be able to detect the white dwarf in the sdss spectrum to classify a system as wd / dm binary introduces a significant bias towards young systems that is not present in the samples of single m dwarfs .    in order to investigate this hypothesis",
    "further we show in figure[f - age ] the activity fractions as a function of age for 118 wide wd / dm binaries with available estimated ages ( section[s - age ] ) .",
    "two important results are extracted from inspecting this figure .",
    "( 1 ) as expected , m dwarfs in wide wd / dm binaries are in general significantly younger than the average age of field m dwarfs of @xmath37gyrs @xcite . on average ,",
    "younger stars rotate faster and therefore a considerably higher fraction of m dwarfs in wd / dm binaries are active .",
    "( 2 ) there is a clear decrease of the activity fractions for older systems . even though the errors in the activity fractions are fairly broad , this is in very good agreement with magnetic braking slowing down the rotation of the m dwarfs that are part of wide wd / dm binaries with time .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the activity fractions measured for the systems with available ages seem to be higher than those obtained for the complete wide wd / dm binary sample ( see figure[f - age ] and right panel of figure[f - frac ] ) .",
    "this is simply because we can only obtain reliable ages if the white dwarfs are hot enough to dominate the sdss wd / dm binary spectra , which reflects in an effective temperature of @xmath38k , depending on the spectral type of the m dwarf .",
    "thus an older population containing inactive systems exists in our wide wd / dm binary sample for which we are not able to estimate the ages , making the activity fractions lower for the complete wide wd / dm binary sample but still considerably higher than those measured for field m dwarfs .",
    "we conclude that the age effect described above can explain the observed difference between the activity fractions measured by @xcite for single m dwarfs and those obtained here for the m dwarfs in wide wd / dm binaries .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , rotation and magnetic activity are strongly correlated .",
    "the strength of activity increases with rotation and saturates around @xmath39 , the exact value of the saturation threshold velocity depending on the mass of the star @xcite .",
    "such a saturation - type rotation - activity relation has been observed for the entire spectral type range of m dwarfs @xcite .    in this section",
    "we investigate the saturation - type relation in our sample of 47 pcebs for which we know the orbital periods ( section[s - pcebfrac ] ) . for this purpose , the strength of magnetic activity of the 47 systems is quantified by the ratio between the h@xmath5 and bolometric luminosities , l@xmath1/l@xmath40 .",
    "this luminosity ratio is obtained from the measured ew@xmath1 values ( see section[s - ident ] ) following the equations of @xcite , who obtained conversion factors between the two considered quantities .",

    "one could speculate that we see first indications of chromospheric supersaturation in m dwarfs .",
    "however , the current data are clearly not conclusive and additional measurements of chromospheric activity of m dwarfs in fast rotating pcebs are required to test this hypothesis .",
    "angular momentum evolution , rotation and age are closely related in low - mass stars .",
    "magnetic field generation strongly depends on the rossby number , therefore the rotation , of a given star @xcite .",
    "thus , magnetic activity increases with rotation until its strength saturates for fast rotation rates @xcite .",
    "magnetic braking slows down the rotation of the star and consequently magnetic activity and rotation decrease in time @xcite .",
    "the timescale of magnetic braking depends on the mass of the star , i.e. in fully convective stars magnetic braking becomes inefficient @xcite and the activity lifetimes increase @xcite .",
    "wd / dm binaries offer an excellent opportunity to independently investigate the relations among magnetic activity , rotation and age in m dwarfs .",
    "this is because wd / dm binaries can be separated into wide binaries that never interacted , and in which the properties of the m dwarf components should be fairly similar to those of single stars , as well as close binaries that underwent common envelope evolution ( pcebs ) in which the m dwarf is tidally locked and rotates very rapidly @xcite . to test the activity - rotation - age connection with the largest and most homogeneous sample of sdss wd / dm dwarf binaries",

    "our main results can be summarised as follows :    * we have demonstrated that for m dwarfs in pcebs fast rotation implies activity independently of the spectral type .",

    "<S> we make use of the largest and most homogeneous sample of white dwarf / m dwarf ( wd / dm ) binaries from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss dr7 ) to investigate relations between magnetic activity , rotation , magnetic braking and age in m stars . </S>",
    "<S> these relations are studied separately for close wd / dm binaries that underwent a common envelope phase and thus contain tidally locked and hence rapidly rotating m dwarfs , and for wide wd / dm binaries that never interacted . for the wide wd / dm binary sample </S>",
    "<S> we find that the m dwarf activity fractions are significantly higher than those measured in single m stars of spectral type m0 to m5 . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute this effect as a consequence of m dwarfs in wide sdss wd / dm binaries being , on average , significantly younger and hence more active than the field m dwarf population . </S>",
    "<S> the measured m dwarf activity fractions in wide wd / dm binaries show as well a significant increase from spectral types m3 to m5 , where these low - mass stars become fully convective . </S>",
    "<S> this provides additional observational evidence for magnetic braking being less efficient below the fully convective boundary , in agreement with the hypothesis of fully convective stars having considerably longer activity lifetimes than partially convective stars . </S>",
    "<S> the m dwarfs in all our close binaries are active , independently of the spectral type , giving robust observational evidence for magnetic activity being enhanced due to fast rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational velocities of the m dwarfs in our close binary sample are significantly higher than seen among field m dwarfs , however the strength of magnetic activity remains saturated at @xmath0l@xmath1/l@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this unambiguously confirms the m dwarf saturation - type rotation - activity relation .    </S>",
