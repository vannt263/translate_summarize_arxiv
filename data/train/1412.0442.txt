    "hypothesis testing and interval estimation of parameters in discrete distributions are two of the classic statistical problems , particularly for the binomial and poisson distributions , which remain two of the most important statistical models .",
    "the fact that these distributions are discrete makes it impossible to construct non - randomized confidence intervals that have coverage equal to @xmath0 for all values of the unknown parameter @xmath1 , and , equivalently , impossible to construct two - sided tests with size equal to @xmath2 for all pairs @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the value of @xmath1 under the null hypothesis .",
    "it is however possible to construct confidence intervals that have coverage at least equal to @xmath0 for all values of the unknown parameter , and tests that have size at most equal to @xmath2 .",
    "such intervals and tests are called exact , and are the topic of this paper .    given an observation @xmath5 , the classic method of constructing exact confidence intervals for parameters of some common discrete distributions is to use the fiducial interval of fisher @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are such that @xmath9 for the binomial parameter , the fiducial interval is known as the clopper  pearson interval @xcite and for the mean of a poisson distribution it is known as the garwood interval @xcite .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath10 can be tested against the alternative @xmath11 by checking whether @xmath4 is contained in the fiducial interval .",
    "the p - value @xmath12 of this test is two times the smaller p - value of two one - sided tests :    @xmath13    in their seminal paper on binomial confidence intervals , @xcite write : `` the clopper - pearson interval is wastefully conservative and is not a good choice for practical use , unless strict adherence to the prescription @xmath14 is demanded '' , where @xmath15 denotes the coverage probability .",
    "instead they recommend using approximate intervals , which obtain the nominal confidence level @xmath0 in some average sense , but have lower coverage for some values of @xmath1 .",
    "such intervals are typically shorter than exact intervals , and their corresponding tests typically have higher power .",
    "these advantages comes at the cost that the actual confidence levels may be much lower than stated and that the size of tests may be inflated . for popular approximate intervals the deviations in coverage from @xmath0",
    "may be non - negligible even for large sample sizes @xcite .",
    "for this reason , some statistician prefer to use exact methods like those discussed in this paper , in order to guarantee that confidence levels are not exaggerated and type i error rates are not understated .",
    "when other criteria than merely coverage levels and expected lengths are considered , exact confidence intervals can moreover compare favourably to approximate intervals @xcite .",
    "finally , even if one prefers to use average coverage as a criterion for comparing confidence intervals , it is of interest to study exact intervals due to the facts that these intervals can be adjusted to have coverage @xmath0 on average , and that such adjusted intervals tend to have shorter expected length than other approximate intervals @xcite . for comparisons of exact and approximate intervals in the binomial setting , and further arguments for using exact methods for discrete distributions , see @xcite .    regarding the fiducial clopper  pearson interval , @xcite also write `` better exact methods are available ;",
    "see , for instance , blyth and still ( 1983 ) and casella ( 1986 ) . ''",
    "fiducial intervals are equal - tailed , meaning that the lower bound is a @xmath16 lower confidence bound and that the upper bound is a @xmath16 upper confidence bound .",
    "several authors , including those mentioned by @xcite in the above quote , have proposed shorter exact intervals that improve upon fiducial intervals by letting the tail - coverages vary for different @xmath5 , so that their bounds no longer are @xmath16 confidence bounds @xcite .",
    "such intervals , known as strictly two - sided intervals , tend to have less conservative coverage and are typically shorter than fiducial intervals",
    ". their use has been advocated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "unlike the equal - tailed fiducial intervals , the p - values of tests corresponding to strictly two - sided confidence intervals can not be written as two times the smaller p - value of two one - sided tests . instead , for some test statistic @xmath17 satisfying mild regularity conditions detailed in section [ nested ] ,",
    "the p - value of a strictly two - sided test is defined as @xmath18",
    "if the the null distribution of @xmath17 is asymmetric , the level @xmath2 rejection region of such a test is not the intersection of the rejection regions of two one - sided level @xmath19 tests .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to show that strictly two - sided confidence intervals and hypothesis tests suffer from several problems .",
    "these are illustrated in figure [ fig0 ] , in which the p - values and interval bounds for the mean of a poisson distribution are shown for two tests and their corresponding confidence intervals .",
    "the first of these is the strictly two - sided @xcite interval , the other being the fiducial @xcite interval .",
    "has been observed .",
    "the strictly two - sided @xcite method is shown in black , and the fiducial @xcite method is shown in grey . ]    in the spirit of @xcite , the p - values are plotted as a function of the value @xmath4 of the parameter under the null hypothesis . in the poisson model",
    "it is reasonable to expect that a small change in the null value of @xmath1 should lead to a small change in the p - value , since @xmath20 is continuous in @xmath1 , so that there is no concernable difference between the @xmath21 and @xmath22 models when @xmath23 is infinitesimal .",
    "this is not the case for the strictly two - sided test : its p - value is discontinuous when viewed as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the evidence against two models , which for all practical purposes are indistinguishable , can therefore differ greatly .",
    "several examples of this are seen in figure [ fig0 ] ; the p - value for @xmath24 , for instance , is 0.0722 , so that the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10 % level , while the highly similar hypothesis @xmath25 can not be rejected as its p - value is 0.1071 .",
    "moreover , we would expect that the p - value increases as @xmath4 goes from 0 to the observed @xmath5 , and that it thereafter decreases , since this would mean that the p - value becomes smaller when the null hypothesis agrees less with the data .",
    "this is not the case for the strictly two - sided test .",
    "instead , the p - value sometimes increases when the null @xmath1 is changed to agree less with the observed @xmath5 . as an example , consider the p - values shown in figure [ fig0 ] .",
    "when @xmath26 has been observed from a poisson distribution , the p - value when @xmath27 is 0.0993 , so that the null hypothesis is rejected at the 10 % level . however , even though @xmath26 disagrees even more with the null hypothesis @xmath28 , the p - value for this @xmath4 is 0.1011 , and the hypothesis can not be rejected .",
    "the test corresponding to the fiducial interval does not suffer from either of these problems .",
    "the strictly two - sided confidence interval is no better than its corresponding test .",
    "when the interval bounds are plotted as functions of the confidence level @xmath0 , we see two phenomenons .",
    "the first is that the interval bounds are discontinuous in @xmath0 , meaning that a small change in @xmath2 can cause one of the interval bounds to leap .",
    "the second is that the bounds sometimes are constant , meaning that a change in @xmath2 not necessarily will lead to a change in the bounds .",
    "for some @xmath2 , both bounds remain unchanged in an interval @xmath29 .",
    "there is therefore no guarantee that accepting a larger @xmath2 will lead to a shorter interval ; we say that the interval is not _",
    "strictly nested_. the fiducial interval does not suffer from either of these problems .",
    "these properties can also cause strictly two - sided test and intervals to behave strangely as more data is collected . as an example , consider the @xcite test for the negative binomial proportion @xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath30 successes are observed after @xmath31 trials , the maximum likelihood estimator is @xmath32 and blaker p - value for the test of the hypothesis @xmath33 is 0.0.0929 , causing us to reject the null hypothesis at the 10 % level .",
    "if we then decide to collect more data by requiring that @xmath34 successes should be observed , and observe one failure and one success so that @xmath35 , @xmath36 is still @xmath37",
    ". we would now expect the p - value to decrease as this outcome appears to be even less in line with @xmath33 .",
    "instead , the blaker p - value for @xmath34 and @xmath35 is 0.106 , and we can no longer reject the null hypothesis at the 10 % level .",
    "analogous problems arise for confidence intervals .",
    "the 90 % blaker confidence interval for @xmath1 given @xmath30 and @xmath31 is ( 0.35992 , 0.62279 ) , while for @xmath34 and @xmath35 it is ( 0.36202 , 0.62689 ) . the latter interval is not , as we normally would expect , a subset of the former .",
    "moreover , the interval based on more data is _ wider _ than the interval based on less data : the interval widths are 0.263 and 0.265 , respectively .",
    "as we will see , intervals lacking strict nestedness is equivalent to their corresponding p - values being discontinuous in @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , intervals which are not strictly nested correspond to tests that attach widely differing evidence to indistinguishable hypotheses .",
    "we believe that this is an unacceptable property of a hypothesis test , and argue that such intervals and tests should be avoided .    in this paper we show that these problems are universal for strictly two - sided intervals and tests , when the data is generated by a class of discrete distributions that includes the binomial , poisson and negative binomial distributions .",
    "they also carry over to exact analysis of contingency tables and discrete models with nuisance parameters , when such analyses are based on conditioning that reduces the problem to a one - parameter framework .    in section [",
    "nested ] we give a formal description of the setting for our results .",
    "we then show that the p - values of strictly two - sided tests are discontinuous , and that their corresponding intervals have bounds that are not strictly monotone .",
    "finally , we show that strictly two - sided intervals never are strictly nested , meaning that both interval bounds simultaneously may remain unchanged when @xmath2 is changed .",
    "section [ strictly ] is devoted to showing that strictly two - sided intervals typically have bounds that moreover are discontinuous in @xmath2 , and that the corresponding p - values lack desirable monotonicity properties . in section [ optimality ] it is then demonstrated that fiducial intervals not only are strictly nested but also are the shortest equal - tailed intervals .",
    "the paper concludes with a discussion in section [ discussion ] .",
    "most proofs and some technical details are contained in two appendices .",
    "this section is concerned with nestedness .",
    "we start by defining this concept .",
    "a confidence interval is _ nested _ if the @xmath0 interval is a subset of the @xmath38 interval when @xmath39 , and _",
    "strictly nested _ if the @xmath0 interval always is a proper subset of the @xmath38 interval .",
    "if an interval is not strictly nested , accepting a lower confidence level does not always yield a shorter interval , so that sometimes nothing is gained by increasing @xmath2 . despite the importance of nestedness",
    ", this property has not been discussed much in the literature , likely because it is taken for granted .",
    "notable exceptions are @xcite , who proved that the binomial blyth  still ",
    "casella interval is not strictly nested and @xcite , who showed by example that the blaker interval for a binomial proportion lacks strict nestedness .",
    "next we give some definitions and state the assumptions under which strictly two - sided intervals are not strictly nested .",
    "we will limit our study to parameters of discrete distributions @xmath40 belonging to a class @xmath41 .    [ def2 ]",
    "let @xmath42 denote an unknown parameter , with @xmath43 being a connected open subset of @xmath44 , and let @xmath45 be a sample space consisting of consecutive integers .",
    "a family of distributions @xmath40 on @xmath46 parameterized by @xmath42 belongs to @xmath41 if    1 .   @xmath47 , @xmath48 , 2 .",
    "@xmath40 is stochastically increasing , i.e. @xmath49 is strictly decreasing in @xmath1 for any fixed @xmath50 , 3 .",
    "for any fixed @xmath51 , @xmath20 is differentiable in @xmath1 .",
    "conditions a1-a3 are satisfied by for instance the binomial , poisson and negative binomial distributions as long as @xmath43 is the natural parameter space , i.e. as long as it has not been restricted .",
    "this follows directly from the proposition below , the proof of which is given in appendix [ proofs ] .",
    "the conditions are typically also satisfied for other common parameterizations .",
    "[ expfamprop ] if @xmath40 constitutes a regular discrete one - parameter exponential family with an increasing likelihood ratio , where @xmath1 is the natural parameter , then @xmath52 .",
    "to fully understand the implications of the lack of nestedness , we will study the hypothesis tests to which non - nested intervals correspond , so - called strictly two - sided tests :    [ def31 ] consider a two - sided test of @xmath10 versus @xmath53 , with a test statistic @xmath54",
    ". the test is called _ strictly two - sided _ if the p - value of the test is @xmath55 and it satisfies conditions b1-b2 below .",
