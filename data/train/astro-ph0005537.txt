    "the microphysics of particle acceleration in the solar system is a fascinating realm and provides useful paradigms for particle acceleration in other places of the universe . from the observed flux of cosmic rays",
    "it is clear that much more powerful particle accelerators than main sequence stars and their winds must be at work in our galaxy and in other galaxies .",
    "supernova remnants @xcite and radio galaxies @xcite are among the most interesting putative sources of cosmic rays .",
    "the cosmic ray pressure is rather large and compares with that of the interstellar magnetic fields implying that cosmic rays are an important ingredient in the dynamics of the interstellar medium , and possibly also in the dynamics of the intergalactic medium ( in superclusters ) .",
    "this imposes strong constraints on the energetics of possible cosmic ray sources from which one can infer the particle acceleration efficiency .",
    "for instance , supernova blast waves can supply the flux of cosmic rays up to the so - called knee in their spectrum at an energy of @xmath2  ev only if their particle acceleration efficiency is as large as @xmath3 @xcite which basically invalidates simple test - particle approaches for the description of the acceleration mechanism .",
    "this has enforced the two - fluid theory for shock acceleration in which the momentum flux due to accelerated particles is self - consistently included into the dynamics of the shock wave @xcite . in this contribution",
    "it is argued that if radio galaxies are the most powerful particle accelerators in the universe responsible for the diffuse isotropic gamma - ray background , and possibly also for the ultrahigh - energy cosmic rays up to at least @xmath4  ev ( the so - called greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin cutoff ) , they require a particle acceleration efficiency even larger than that of supernova remnants .",
    "the energy losses of relativistic particles inevitably lead to @xmath0-radiation by which the acceleration sites can be traced .",
    "the cumulative flux from all unresolved cosmic accelerators appears as an diffuse isotropic flux in an inertial frame .",
    "a diffuse high - latitude @xmath0-ray background has been measured with cgro from mev to @xmath5  gev photon energies which very likely arises from unresolved extragalactic sources @xcite .",
    "the resolved sources already contribute @xmath6 of the diffuse isotropic flux and show the same average spectral shape as the diffuse background .",
    "the background spectrum above 30  mev as determined with egret on board cgro is given by @xmath7 the spectrum continues into the mev range .",
    "most of the background flux below 10  mev can be explained by the contribution of supernovae ia from the era of galaxy formation at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in this thermal component of the diffuse @xmath0-ray background are not very large , the known element abundances tightly constrain the total number of snia , and hence the total energy flux in @xmath0-rays , in the universe leaving little room for other sources contributing in the mev range",
    ". the uncertainty in the cosmic star formation history due to possible dust enshrouding of the earliest galaxies should amount to less than a factor of three . integrating the above non - thermal background spectrum between 10  mev and 30  gev ( the flux at higher energies must be considered somewhat unreliable due to the strongly decreasing aperture of egret ) one obtains the energy density @xmath9 or @xmath10 where @xmath11 parametrizes the hubble constant .",
    "calorimetry of the particles accelerated throughout the universe requires to know whether all @xmath0-rays emitted by a source also reach the present - day observer .",
    "however , @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath12 can interact with low - energy photons of energy @xmath13 from the diffuse isotropic background over cosmological distance scales @xmath14 producing electron - positron pairs @xmath15 , if their energy exceeds the threshold energy @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the cosine of the scattering angle @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-ray attenuation @xmath18 due to pair production becomes important if the mean free path @xmath19 becomes smaller than @xmath14 , i.e. if the optical depth obeys @xmath20 .",
    "for the computation of @xmath21 one first needs to know the pair production cross section @xmath22{10 cm } { } \\sigma_{\\gamma\\gamma}={3\\sigma_{\\rm t}\\over 16 } ( 1-\\beta^2)\\left[2\\beta(\\beta^2 - 2)+(3-\\beta^4)\\ln\\left(1+\\beta\\over 1-\\beta\\right)\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and where @xmath25 denotes the thomson cross section @xcite .",
    "then one needs the geodesic radial displacement function @xmath26^{-1}$ ] to compute the line integral from @xmath27 to some @xmath28 . for a cosmological model with @xmath29 and",
    "@xmath30 the function @xmath31 simplifies to @xmath32 .",
    "hence one obtains the optical depth @xmath33 adopting a non - evolving present - day background density @xmath34 , i.e. @xmath35 where the dash indicates comoving - frame quantities .",
    "the simplifying assumption that the photon density transforms geometrically corresponds to a situation in which an initial short burst of star formation at @xmath36 produced most of the diffuse infrared - to - ultraviolet background radiation .",
    "fig.1 shows the spectrum of the low - energy diffuse background used to solve eq.(6 ) numerically .",
    "figure 2 shows the resulting @xmath37 ( omitting the subscript hereafter ) curve for the microwave - to - ultraviolet diffuse background spectrum shown in fig.1 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath0-rays above @xmath38  gev can not reach us from beyond redshifts of @xmath39 .",
    "higher energy @xmath0-rays can reach us only from sources at lower redshifts ( e.g. @xmath0-rays with energies up to 10  tev have been observed from mrk  501 at @xmath40 in accord with fig.2 @xcite )",
    ".    0.5 cm * corollary i : * _ if the digb originates from unresolved sources distributed in redshift similar to galaxies , its spectrum must steepen above @xmath41  gev due to @xmath0-ray pair attenuation . _ 0.5 cm    here is has been tacitly assumed that the @xmath0-rays which have turned into electron - positron pairs do not show up again .",
    "this is , in fact , not quite true , since the pairs are subject to inverse - compton scattering off the microwave background thereby replenishing @xmath0-rays .",
    "the 2.7  k background is more important as a target than the shorter wavelength background , since there is no threshold condition for thomson scattering contrary to pair production and since 2.7  k photons greatly outnumber the latter .",
    "the inverse - compton scattered microwave photons turn into @xmath0-rays of energy @xmath42 conserving the energy of the absorbed @xmath0-ray which corresponds to a constant @xmath43 , i.e. the expected slope of the differential spectrum is about -2 ( -2.1 observed )",
    ". a negligible amount of energy is lost to lower frequency synchrotron emission , if magnetic fields are present in the interagalactic medium .",
    "0.5 cm * corollary ii : * _ energy conservation in the reprocessing of @xmath0-rays from higher to lower energies by pair production and subsequent inverse - compton scattering produces an approximate @xmath44 power law digb between @xmath45  mev and @xmath41  gev .",
    "the energy density of the accelerated particles in the sources ( @xmath46 ) must obey @xmath47 for consistency . defining the radiative efficiency @xmath48\\ ] ] where @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote the adiabatic and energy loss time scales , respectively , the energy requirement for the sources",
    "is minimized for @xmath51 . in extragalactic radio sources",
    ", @xmath52 corresponds to very large electron ( @xmath53 ) or proton lorentz factors ( @xmath54 ) consistent with the non - thermal @xmath0-ray spectra extending above 10  gev .",
    "the resolved extragalactic @xmath0-ray sources belong to the so - called blazar subclass of radio - loud active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in which one observes jets emerging from accreting supermassive black holes preferentially at small angles to their relativistic velocity vector .",
    "if the entire class of radio - loud agn is responsible for the digb , the particle acceleration efficiency is constrained by @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the total ( kinetic + magnetic + randomized relativistic particle ) energy density in extragalactic jets . since @xmath57 is known ( eq.(1 ) )",
    ", a determination of @xmath56 is necessary to further constrain @xmath58 .",
    "this energy density can be inferred from the relative strengths of the various bumps in the overall diffuse background spectrum ( fig.3 ) in the following way .",
    "the microwave bump is the well - known signature of the big bang at the time of decoupling with its energy density given by the stefan - boltzmann law @xmath59 .",
    "the bump in the far - infrared is due to star formation in early galaxies ( at @xmath60 ) , since part of the stellar light , which is visible as the bump at visible wavelengths , is reprocessed by dust obscuring the star - forming regions .",
    "the energy density of the two bumps can be inferred from the present - day heavy element abundances .",
    "heavy elements have a mass fraction @xmath61 and were produced in early bursts of star formation by nucleosynthesis with radiative efficiency @xmath62 yielding @xmath63 about half of the energy is contained in either bump .",
    "it has been shown recently by a number of groups that probably all galaxies ( except dwarfs ) contain supermassive black holes in their centers which are actively accreting over a fraction of @xmath64 of their lifetime implying that the electromagnetic radiation released by the accreting black holes amounts to @xmath65 adopting the accretion efficiency @xmath66 and the black hole mass fraction @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "most of the accretion power emerges in the ultraviolet where the diffuse background is unobservable owing to photoelectric absorption by the neutral component of the interstellar medium .",
    "however , a fraction of @xmath68 ( from the average quasar spectral energy distribution @xcite ) shows up in hard x - rays due to coronal emission from the accretion disk to produce the diffuse isotropic x - ray background bump with @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "jets with non - thermal ( @xmath0-ray ) emission show up only in the radio - loud fraction @xmath70 of all agn and their kinetic power roughly equals the accretion power @xcite .",
    "hence one obtains for the energy density in extragalactic jets @xmath71 substituting this value into eq.(9 ) one obtains a limit for the acceleration efficiency @xmath72 which has to be compared with the 13% efficiency required for supernova remnants . since a radiative efficiency much lower than unity must be considered realistically ( e.g. , to account for the pdv work of the jets against a surrounding intracluster medium ) , the acceleration efficiency may have to be as large as @xmath73 or more .",
    "possible escapes to this conclusion are ( i ) the radio - loud fraction was much larger at high redshifts than at low redshifts , ( ii ) there is another contributor to the gamma - ray background , such as the decay of topological defects @xcite , or ( iii ) the flux of the digb is actually lower due to the foreground from a galactic halo @xcite .",
    "an extragalactic cosmic ray component seems to be evident from the observed change in slope of the local spectrum above @xmath74  ev . the slope of this extragalactic component is much steeper than @xmath75 consistent with the steepening due to energy losses for a cosmologically distributed and evolving source population , such as extragalactic radio sources @xcite .",
    "the total energy density in the loss - steepened extragalactic cosmic ray component and the digb are of the same order of magnitude , as required if the @xmath0-rays trace neutral pions and the cosmic rays trace neutrons produced in photo - meson production events .",
    "the particle acceleration efficiency of the jets in radio galaxies must be larger than @xmath76 if the @xmath0-rays from these jets are to explain the digb .",
