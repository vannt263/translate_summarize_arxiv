    "the value of the hubble constant @xmath0 fixes the fundamental physical scale and time scale of the universe , therefore by inference its age .",
    "dichotomous results are obtained in discordant ranges , even allowing for their internal error estimates .",
    "the results are dependent upon the choice of the cosmological distance ladder used ( fukugita et al .",
    ", 1993 , freedman et al . , 1996 , saha et al . , 1996 )",
    "however , both the longer distance scale ( @xmath3 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) , and the shorter distance scale ( @xmath4 kms@xmath2mpc@xmath2 ) rely strongly on the cepheid period - luminosity relation calibrated in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , and assumed to be independent of metallicity . the cepheid period - luminosity ( pl ) relation",
    "is widely considered to be the most accurate way available to measure extragalactic distances on small scale .",
    "the cepheids are relatively young , bright periodic variable stars which pulsational periods are strongly correlated with their luminosity . their distance is therefore determined via a comparison to a calibrated pl relation .",
    "cepheids are observed in distant galaxies , up to the virgo cluster , in order to calibrate secondary distance indicators that connect to the hubble flow .    the theory ( stothers , 1988 , stift 1990 , chiosi et al . , 1993 ,",
    "stift 1995 ) predicts a small abundance ( helium fraction and heavy elements ) effect on the pl zero point due to : ( i ) theory of stellar pulsation through the dependence of period on mass and radius .",
    "( ii ) theory of stellar evolution through the mass luminosity relation .",
    "( iii ) theory of stellar atmosphere through the relation between effective temperature , absolute magnitude in bandpasses and bolometric correction . disentangling the effects of metallicity and reddening has a venerable history ( feast 1991 ) .",
    "various observational studies since the 70s , have looked for and found a color shift between lmc and smc cepheids ( e.g. gascoigne 1974 , martin et al .",
    "caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) and more recently laney & stobie ( 1994 ) used theoretical and empirical relations , as well as individual reddenings from color - color diagrams to derive pl relations adjusted for abundance differences .",
    "their approach is different from ours ( and the technique used by the @xmath5 teams ) ; a full comparison will be model dependent ( flux redistribution models ) and we have not attempted to do that here",
    ". a limited comparison to the vjhk table 6 of laney & stobie ( 1994 ) shows that we confirm the sense of their results .",
    "an empirical test ( freedman and madore , 1990 , gould , 1994 ) in three fields of m31 with 36 cepheids and 152 bvri measurements have led to ambiguous results . as part of the hst key project on extragalactic distance scale observations , a further check is planned by observations of two fields in m101 . currently , all hst studies assume that the cepheid pl relation has no metallicity dependence ( freedman et al .",
    ", 1994a , freedman et al . , 1994b , sandage et al . , 1994 , tanvir et al . , 1995 , kennicutt et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "we used a new data set of 481 cepheids and 3 millions measurements in two colours obtained in the lmc and the smc to derive the dependence of the optical period luminosity relations on metallicity .",
    "observations were obtained as a by - product of the eros ( exprience de recherche dobjets sombres , aubourg et al . , 1993 ) microlensing survey .",
    "observations have been obtained from eso la silla using a 0.4 m f/10 reflecting telescope and a @xmath6 mosaic of ccds ( arnaud et al . , 1994ab ) .",
    "during the @xmath7 nights of 1991 - 1992 campaign ( beaulieu et al . , 1995 , grison et al . , 1995 )",
    ", about 2000 images have been obtained in the bar of the lmc in a blue and a red bandpass ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , whereas about 6000 images have been obtained in a crowded field of the smc with a near pair of very similar filters ( @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) during the @xmath12 nights of 1994 - 1995 season ( beaulieu et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "an accurate and reliable photometric transformation have been constructed between the two systems .",
    "hence we present a differential analysis that relies on no external zero - point and thus completed within the ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) system . since we apply our result to hst @xmath13 , @xmath14 observations , we make use of the fact that the net transmission of the @xmath8 band after convolution with the ccd reponse is much closer to johnson @xmath13 than to johnson @xmath15 . the transformation is similar to that between the broader @xmath5 f555w filter and @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath9 band is between cousin @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath17 color transforms well to @xmath18 : @xmath19mag .",
    "the two data sets were searched for cepheids with fourier analysis ( grison 1994 ) and phase dispersion minimisation techniques ( schwarzenberg - czerny 1989 ) .",
    "stars affected by blending effects have been excluded of the sample .",
    "the high quality , excellent phase coverage light curves were fourier analysed to separate between the classical cepheids that pulsate in the fundamental mode , and the so called s - cepheids that pulsate in the first overtone , and therefore follow a different period luminosity relation . in the lmc we keep 51 fundamental pulsators and 27 first overtone pulsators , and 264 fundamental pulsators and 141 first overtone pulsators in the smc .",
    "so , we have two complete samples of cepheids that fill densely the period - magnitude - color [ plc ] space , with known difference in metallicity @xmath20_{lmc - smc } = 0.35 $ ] ( spite and spite , 1991 , luck and lambert 1992 ) .",
    "we compare the two samples in the plc manifold to derive 2 independant sources of difference @xmath21 distance and extinction , and to search for a third one @xmath21 metallicity .",
    "the method will be applied independently to both fundamental and first overtone pulsators , and is a @xmath22 minimization fit to a model .",
    "details of the method are presented elsewhere ( sasselov et al . , 1996 ) .",
    "the model is built on the basis of the technique used for determining cepheid distances to galaxies by the @xmath5 key project ( freedman and madore , 1990 ) .",
    "it is as follows : the lmc pl relation is used to slide the observed pl relation against it ; the galactic extinction law is applied in deriving the reddening ( implicitly assuming @xmath23 difference between the ensemble colors of the cepheids in lmc and the observed galaxy ) ; a true distance modulus is derived by adopting a lmc distance and correcting for extinction ( using the reddening derived above with adopted lmc reddening e(b - v)=0.10 ) .",
    "other assumptions in the technique ( and our model ) are : constant pl slope with metallicity ( confirmed by our observations ) and no depth dispersion in the lmc cepheid sample ( which is only from the lmc bar ) . in the application we use as constrains the independently derived foreground reddening of lmc ( 0.06 ) and smc ( 0.05 ) , and the line of nodes for smc from caldwell & coulson ( 1986 ) to derive the eros smc sample depth dispersion .",
    "we fit for different fixed values of the extinction parameter @xmath24 .",
    "the model describes the case considered by stothers ( 1988 ) in his equation ( 26 ) .",
    "we model the @xmath8 , @xmath9 data in the plc space taking into account the high degree of correlation between the measurements following the formalism introduced by gould ( 1994 ) .",
    "unlike gould , we solve for a wavelength dependance of a metallicity effect .",
    "our model has 12 parameters , which are : linear fits of the corelations in the plc projections ( slopes @xmath25,@xmath26 and the zero points @xmath27,@xmath28 ) , the distance difference @xmath29 , the relative reddening difference @xmath30 , and the metallicity terms @xmath31 ( @xmath32=1,2 are the two passbands , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "the model parameters are estimated by minimizing the mean magnitude residuals , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the observed mean magnitude in the @xmath32 band for a cepheid with period @xmath35 .",
    "for example , the residuals for the smc sample are given as :    @xmath36    @xmath37 @xmath38,\\ ] ] with @xmath39 being the number of cepheids .",
    "the form of the covariance matrices of the data , the @xmath22 minimization and the iteration procedure are described in sasselov et al .",
    "we applied the global fitting procedure to the data - set of fundamental mode and first overtone mode pulsators independently , and we obtained the same results . + the two set of pl relation give , before correction for metallicity and reddening , the same distance modulus difference of @xmath40mag .",
    "the other model parameters have the following values for the fundamental pulsators : @xmath41 ; @xmath42 @xmath43 ; @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "we adopted the same extinction law with @xmath48 for the smc .",
    "the correction due to the metallicity dependence of the inferred distance modulus by the described technique is then @xmath49mag .",
    "the sources of error are the photometric transformation , between the two data sets ( 0.06 mag ) , the scatter in the pl relation ( 0.04 mag ) and the uncertainties in the reddening and depth determination in the smc ( 0.03 mag ) .",
    "an alternative to the metallicity effect could be unusual smc extinction with a value of @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "we consider this alternative to be very unlikely , because it requires that the extinction be less than the foreground to smc and an unusually high @xmath24 value unjustified by any other evidence . on the other hand , with @xmath52 ,",
    "our mean reddening value is in good agreement with a number of other independent estimates ( bessell 1991 ) .",
    "we derive the following metallicity dependence of reddening corrected distance moduli of cepheids : @xmath53 where z is the abundance of heavy elements ( by mass ) in the studied cepheids  and @xmath54=0.0085 .",
    "the metallicity dependence is valid in the spectral region covered by the eros filters , but can be applied to hst ( v , i ) work for the reasons presented in sect.2 above .",
    "the form of the metallicity dependence used here is based on theoretical considerations and is a good assumption in the suggested range of application of @xmath55 ( chiosi _ et al .",
    "_ 1993 ) .    despite its relative weakness ,",
    "this metallicity effect is significant to extragalactic distance measurements .",
    "this is especially true when the color shift due to metallicity @xmath56 is interpretated as reddening in the determination of the true distance modulus of a target galaxy ( freedman et al .",
    ", 1994a , freedman et al . , 1994b , sandage et al . , 1994 ,",
    "tanvir et al . , 1995 ,",
    "kennicutt et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "recent efforts to determine @xmath0 from cepheid  distances have focused on : ( 1 ) the virgo cluster galaxies ( freedman et al . , 1994a ) , ( 2 ) the leo  i group ( tanvir et al . ,",
    "1995 ) , containing elliptical galaxies ; and ( 3 ) the parent galaxies ( sandage et al . , 1994 ) of supernovae of type ia .",
    "all these studies use the same modern technique with the lmc as a base and all the same initial assumptions ; we share them in our analysis . yet they result in three different values of @xmath0 , with hardly overlaping error bars .",
    "the abundances of metals in the young populations of the host galaxies for these studies differ and , apparently , in a systematic way .",
    "therefore we propose that the metallicity dependence may be responsible for most of this discrepancy .    with the first approach and hst @xmath57 photometry of cepheids  in m100",
    ", they derive @xmath58 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 . for the metallicity of the cepheids  we adopt [ fe / h]=+0.1 ( z=0.02 ) , derived from the abundances of      with the second approach and hst @xmath57 photometry of cepheids  in m96 ( tanvir et al . , 1995 ) , they derive @xmath62 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "oey & kennicutt ( 1991 ) give an abundance estimate for m96 of [ fe / h]=-0.02 .",
    "this implies a small change in the cepheid  distance to m96 and the value of @xmath0 , @xmath63 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 .    with the third approach and hst @xmath57 photometry of cepheids  in ic4182 and ngc5253 ( sandage et al . , 1994 )",
    ", they derive @xmath64 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "abundances in ngc5253 have been measured and discussed ( pagel et al . ,",
    "1992 ) ; discussion of abundances in ic4182 has been also given by saha et al .",
    ", ( 1996 ) @xmath21 we adopt [ fe / h]=-1.3 and caution on the large uncertainties . with this metallicity @xmath65 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 .",
    "other systematic effects in the sn  ia method ( riess et al . , 1995 ) ,",
    "bring the value of @xmath0 even further up ; to a value also favored by new theoretical sn models ( hflich and khokhlov 1996 ) .",
    "the new value of @xmath66 km.s@xmath59@xmath60 ( sandage et al . , 1996 ) includes two sne  ia in spiral galaxies , which cepheid metallicity is most likely similar to that of the lmc .",
    "note , however , that the two sn ( 1981b and 1990n ) are by 0.2@xmath210.4 @xmath67 dimmer than the three sns in ic4182 and ngc5253 . therefore , the result we obtained above by accounting for the effect of metallicity on the cepheid distances for each galaxy , remains virtually unchanged .",
