    "for a heavy quarkonium coupling to gluons , the vertex can be obtained with its radial wave function at origin , or its differentiation .",

    "even when stretching all parameters to their extreme values , the predictions stay a factor 3 - 6 below the data @xcite .",
    "moreover , the obtained branching ratio dominantly come from the end - point region , where the pqcd is not available . as stated by bodwin , braaten , and lepage @xcite ,",
    "the color - octet decay contribution arising from the higher fock component @xmath72 of the @xmath4 wave function is actually not suppressed with respect to the usual color - singlet decay , owing to the angular momentum barrier in @xmath73 contribution , and is necessary to separate rigorously short - distance effects and long - distance effects . including the color - octet contributions , branching ratio of @xmath74 can be compared with the experimental data @xcite .",

    "the coupling of a @xmath77 state to two gluons can be obtained from the requirements such as linear in the polarization vectors of two gluons , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , and lorentz and gauge invariant @xcite . keeping only the leading twist term",

    "the total width of @xmath3 , can be obtained by its decay width to two on - shell gluons with @xmath95 : @xmath96    similarly , we can obtain the width of @xmath13 decay to two pions @xmath97 and the total width @xmath98    comparing eqs .",
    "( [ 2part ] ) and ( [ 0part ] ) with eqs .",
    "( [ c2part])-([ctot ] ) , it can be shown that there are two different ingredients between the glueball decay and the @xmath51-wave quarkonium decay .",
    "i ) there is no end - point singularity in the expression ( [ 2part ] ) and ( [ 0part ] ) for the glueball decay since gluons in the glueball are directly related to the glueball wave function ; ii ) since we get the total width by the decay to two on - shell gluons , it depends on the glueball wave function at a particular momentum point .",
    "especially , the point is located at @xmath99 .",
    "intuitively , the wave function must be peaked at low momentum , since a composite particle has little amplitude for existing while its constituents are flying apart with large momentum . while the mass @xmath100 is large , the obtained width decreases fast and depends on the shape of the wave function drastically . on the other side , the next order contributions to the total width , whose amplitudes are expected to have the form @xmath101 in general , will be lack of the suppression of the wave function and not sensitive to the shape of the wave function as long as @xmath102 is smooth .",
    "it means that the higher order contributions are important to the total width if the mass is large , since the zero - th order contribution is suppressed strongly by wave function . in another word",
    ", the pqcd evolution of the wave function to a particular scale will be nontrivial .",
    "the formula for decay to a pair of kaons can be easily obtained by substituting the distrubtion amplitude of pions by that of kaons . as a result of isospin symmetry ,",
    "the branching ratio to @xmath103 is half of the charged channel except that @xmath103 in the final state can be formed _ via _ qcd anomaly .",
    "this contribution is negligible due to the minor difference between the mass of @xmath104-quark and @xmath105-quark .",
    "the anomaly contributions to @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 channels are not necessarily small , since two soft gluons have large possibility to form a @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) meson @xcite : @xmath111 however , it is a low energy theorem .",
    "if the energy scale of the decay process is high enough , the anomaly contribution is also negligible as it emerges _ via _ qcd renormalization and is essentially a higher order contribution in @xmath112 .",
    "for example , the branching ratio of @xmath113 has no apparent enhancement comparing with @xmath103 channel .",
    "so the branching ratios of @xmath106 , @xmath107 and @xmath108 channels are expected to have the same order of @xmath30 channel if pqcd dominate the decay process .",
    "evaluation of eqs . ( [ 2part]@xmath114[0tot ] ) will require the glueball wave function , which we have little information about up to now . in the following context we will use an oscillator wave function @xmath115 with parameter appropriately chosen . if @xmath13 and @xmath3 glueballs have similar wave functions in momentum space as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , a constraint on @xmath116 can be obtained from their total decay width .",
    "the @xmath13 glueball candidates @xmath117 and @xmath118 have widths @xmath119 mev . the @xmath3 glueball candidate @xmath120 has width @xmath114 20 mev . from our width formulae",
    "( [ 2tot ] ) and ( [ 0tot ] ) we have @xmath121 if the masses of scalar and tensor states are equal , the ratio will be simply @xmath122 , which is in accord with ref .",
    "@xcite . taking into account the mass gap",
    ", we get @xmath123  gev@xmath124 if @xmath125 . in general , @xmath126 is larger for a higher mass state .",
    "for example , @xmath127 is larger that @xmath128 ( see below ) .",
    "so we get @xmath129 . according to the discussion in the previous section , the higher order corrections may be large and should be larger for a higher mass state .",
    "thus we can say that the lower limit of @xmath130 is 0.4 gev@xmath124 .",
    "furthermore , the parameter @xmath116 is related to the radius of hadron . we know that @xmath131 gev@xmath124 for a well established pion oscillator wave function @xcite .",
    "assuming that all hadrons have similar size , @xmath132 will be in the same range for glueball .",
    "the parameter @xmath132 for the glueball will be taken in the range @xmath133 in the following context .    before getting the numerical results it is necessary to discuss whether the derived formula is applicable or reliable .",
    "the applicability of the pqcd theory to exclusive processes at the present experimental energy region was argued by isgur and smith @xcite by excluding the contributions of the end - point regions where sub - leading ( higher twist ) terms are _ a priori _ likely to be greater than the perturbative contribution .",
    "recently , the applicability of pqcd to the pionic form factor has been examined by cutting end - point contribution  @xcite and by including the effects of sudakov form factor  @xcite .",
    "the first approach argues that the pqcd results are self - consistent in the energy region where the contributions after cutting dominate .",
    "the second one attempts to explain the suppression in the end - point regions by including the effects of sudakov form factor of the quarks , which serves as a natural filter to pick out the hard contributions .",
    "two approaches give similar conclusion that pqcd is applicable to the pion form factor as @xmath134 gev@xmath135 .",
    "in fact , the applicability of pqcd to exclusive processes differs from one process to another and it depends on the end - point singularities .",
    "for example , the hard scattering amplitude of the @xmath4 decay to two pions is more singular than the case of the pion form factor . the obtained rate of @xmath136 depends strongly on the end - point behavior of the pion wave function  @xcite . in the case of the glueball decay , the hard scattering amplitude of glueball decay to two pions is less singular than that of the pion form factor , and it has a good behavior to ensure that the dominant contributions come from the hard part .",
    "we can argue that pqcd is applicable for the glueball , particularly , for the glueball candidate @xmath11 .",
    "we will adopt the first method which is simpler .    in order to realize the condition @xmath137 in eqs .",
    "( [ 2part ] ) and ( [ 0part ] ) , we extend the parameterization of @xmath138 by replacing @xcite @xmath139 to reflect the fact that at low @xmath140 the transverse momentum intrinsic to the bound state wave - function flow through all the propagators .",
    "the parameter @xmath141 can be determined to ensure @xmath142 .",
    "the cut contribution , obtained by cutting the integral limit to keep only hard contributions , say , @xmath143 , will be compared with the uncut contribution .    in order to calculate the decay width we take the wave function of the pion and the kaon as  @xcite    @xmath144 , \\\\",

    "also we examine the applicability of pqcd to the glueball decay by cutting end - point contributions .",
    "our numerical results show that the hard part ( @xmath160 ) contribute about 81% to @xmath161 , whose value is listed in table i , and the ratio is nearly the same for different @xmath130 because the partial width is not sensitive to @xmath130 .",

    "we show that the hard scattering amplitude of glueball decay has a good behavior at the end - point region and is favored by pqcd while @xmath4 is opposite .",
    "the reason is that gluons are directly related to the wave function for glueball decay .",
    "the extra quark propagator ( and the differentiation on it ) produces the end - point singularity in @xmath4 exclusive decay .",
    "more specific speaking , pqcd is applicable for @xmath11 decay to two mesons if it is a @xmath3 glueball , but is not reliable for @xmath117 .",
    "\\(3 ) related to the end - point singularity in @xmath4 decay , the color octet contributions have the same order as color singlet and may be the essential part for @xmath51-wave state quarkonium decay .",
    "therefore , the dynamic mechanism will be very different for decays of glueball and quarkonium with the same @xmath163 .",
    "\\(4 ) it is not difficult to generalize our calculation to other two - meson decay processes .",
    "the conclusion is expected to be similar .",
