    "observations over the past decade have suggested a strong connection between supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) and their host galaxies , or rather spheroids , in spite of the huge difference between their respective sizes . while it is clear that the stories of these two objects  the black hole and the galaxy  are tightly interwoven , the origin and nature of their link are still a subject of debate .",
    "the scaling relations between the smbh mass , @xmath0 , and the host spheroid properties make the study of black hole growth an indispensable ingredient to understand the more general framework of galaxy formation and evolution . beyond the well known relation with the velocity dispersion @xmath6 @xcite , the masses of smbhs",
    "have been shown to correlate with a wide series of properties belonging to the spheroidal component of the host galaxy , such as the spheroid luminosity @xcite and stellar mass @xcite , the spheroid dynamical mass @xcite and the central stellar concentration of the spheroid @xcite .",
    "the connection between bulge mass and disc galaxy morphological type means that the pitch angle of a disc galaxy s spiral arms is also related to the black hole mass ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the old @xmath7 and @xmath8 relations were actually inconsistent with each other ( e.g. @xcite ) , and inconsistent with the curved @xmath2 relation @xcite given the existence of a linear @xmath9 relation ( see section [ sec : predmbhn ] ) .",
    "the first of these inconsistencies was addressed in @xcite ( @xcite ; see also section 6 of @xcite ) , and we tackle the second here .",
    "the astrophysical interest in all of these empirical relations resides partly in the fact that they must _ all _ be taken into account by any complete theory or model describing the coevolution of galaxies and smbhs , and also in their employment to predict the masses of smbhs in other galaxies .",
    "a decade ago @xcite presented evidence for a strong correlation between the stellar light concentration @xmath10 of spheroids and their smbh mass , showing that more centrally concentrated spheroids have more massive black holes . @xcite re - investigated the same relation , directly using the @xcite index @xmath1 as a measure of the radial concentration of the stars .",
    "in addition to a log - linear relation , @xcite fit a log - quadratic regression , finding that the @xmath2 relation changed slopes at the low- and high - mass end , and had a level of scatter equivalent to the @xmath11 relation at that time ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the advantages of using the @xmath2 relation to predict the mass of smbhs are several : as noted by @xcite , the measurement of @xmath1 requires only images ( even photometrically uncalibrated ) ; is not heavily affected by possible kinematic substructure at the center of a galaxy , nor by rotational velocity or the vertical velocity dispersion of an underlying disc , nor by aperture corrections ; it is cheap to acquire in terms of telescope time ; does not depend on galaxy distances .",
    "@xcite have recently pointed out that the recent deep , wide - field photometric surveys of galaxies  e.g. the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) and the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama , @xcite )  are providing us with large statistically useful samples of galaxies whose major morphological components can be resolved out to @xmath13 . furthermore , automatic image analysis routines , such as gim2d @xcite , galfit @xcite , budda @xcite and galphat ( yoon , weinberg & katz , in preparation ) , can be used to model the surface brightness distribution of the stellar components of these galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) . a bulge / disc decomposition , along with adequate corrections to account for dust and inclination effects as provided by @xcite ,",
    "can provide the srsic index of the spheroid component of both elliptical and disc galaxies .",
    "this can then be used to predict black hole masses in large samples of galaxies to derive the local black hole mass function ( e.g. @xcite ) and space density ( @xcite , and references therein ) , if a well calibrated @xmath2 relation exists .",
    "however , in the past two years @xcite , @xcite and @xcite have failed to recover a strong @xmath2 relation .    due to the existence of the luminosity-@xmath1 relation ( e.g. @xcite , and references therein ) and the @xmath14luminosity relation ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", an @xmath2 relation must exist .",
    "it is important to investigate why the @xmath2 relation may not have been recovered in the above studies .",
    "it is also important to know how it fits in with , and is consistent with , the other scaling relations .",
    "not only does a proper and complete understanding of the smbh - galaxy connection require this , but the central concentration of stars , reflecting the inner gradient of the gravitational potential , should be intimately related to the black hole mass . a well determined @xmath2 relation may also provide an easy and accurate means to predict black hole masses in other galaxies . eventually , semi - analytic models of galaxy formation and simulations should include in their recipes _ all _ of the black hole mass scaling relations .    in this work we present a census of literature srsic index measurements for local galaxies with directly measured supermassive black hole mass .",
    "we re - investigate and recover the @xmath2 relation using the combined data from four past independent works . in section [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe our galaxy sample , and in section [ sec : res ] we present the @xmath2 scaling relation which is then discussed and compared with predictions in section [ sec : predmbhn ] .",
    "finally , we summarize our analysis in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "our smbh galaxy sample comes from @xcite , who have built a catalog of 80 galaxies with supermassive black hole masses obtained from direct maser , stellar or gas kinematic measurements .",
    "black hole masses for our final sample are listed in table [ tab : data ] , along with their total galaxy b - band absolute magnitudes , @xmath15 , taken from the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _",
    "( @xcite , hereafter rc3 ) and also their morphological classification .",
    "the final sample consists of those galaxies for which srsic indices have been reported by at least one of the four studies mentioned below .      the radial light distribution of spheroidal systems ( such as elliptical galaxies or the bulges of lenticular and spiral galaxies ) is well described by the @xcite @xmath16 model that parametrizes the intensity @xmath17 as a function of the projected galactic radius @xmath18 such that @xmath19 \\biggr \\}\\ ] ] ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the intensity at the effective radius @xmath21 that encloses half of the total light from the model , and @xmath22 is a constant defined in terms of the srsic index @xmath1 , which is the parameter that measures the curvature of the radial light profile .",

    "the resulting light profiles were then fit by gd07 with a seeing - convolved srsic @xmath16 model for elliptical galaxies , and with a combined ( seeing - convolved ) exponential disc and @xmath16 bulge for the disc galaxies , using the subroutine uncmnd from @xcite .",
    "the inner couple of arcseconds of the profiles was in some instances excluded from the fit due to the potential presence of partially depleted cores or agns , that would produce a biasing central deficit or excess of light relative to the inward extrapolation of their outer srsic profile .",

    "v12 fit the light distribution using a srsic function for the elliptical galaxies , the bulges and the bars of lenticular / spiral galaxies , and an exponential function for the disc components . in the case of core - srsic galaxies with partially depleted cores , they implemented a mask for the inner region .",
    "bright nuclei were additionally modelled as point sources using the psf . a relation between smbh mass and the srsic index",
    "was not found by v12 .",
    "they noticed that the srsic index can vary significantly from study to study and they suggested that such mismatch may be due to the different weighting of pixels during the fit that each study used and/or to a wavelength bias .",
    "the signal - to - noise weighted fitting routines , such as galfit , can be highly sensitive to central dust obscuration , unaccounted for central excesses and deficits of light relative to the fitted model , and especially errors in the adopted psf .     and that measured along the major - axis @xmath24 .",

    "we plot 10 additional galaxies with @xmath29 taken from the sample of @xcite .",
    "the horizontal offset that separates the bulges of their 4 disc galaxies from their 6 elliptical galaxies supports our predicted gap between the @xmath2 relations for elliptical galaxies and bulges at the low - mass end of this diagram . if the _ bent _ @xmath3 relation is the same for all galaxies  irrespective of their morphology  this gap occurs because elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies inhabit different regions of the @xmath4 diagram ( see figure 14 in @xcite ) .",
    "that is , for a given light profile shape ( i.e. srsic index @xmath1 ) the bulges of disc galaxies are brighter than elliptical galaxies .",
    "figure [ fig : mbhnpred ] allows one to predict that an order of magnitude gap is expected between the smbh masses of srsic elliptical galaxies and the srsic bulges of disc galaxies having the same @xmath1 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mbhnpred ] we also show the black hole masses of 51 galaxies that belong to the sample of @xcite but do not have multiple srsic index measurements . among them",
    ", 13 are core - srsic elliptical galaxies , 5 are core - srsic bulges of disc galaxies , one is a srsic elliptical galaxy and 32 are srsic bulges of disc galaxies .",
    "we point out that measuring the srsic indices of these galaxies could add many useful points to the @xmath2 diagram .",
    "in particular , the 13 extra core - srsic elliptical galaxies would allow one to better explore the @xmath2 diagram in the high-@xmath0 end , between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where most galaxies are thought to have formed from a different process , namely dry major mergers .",
    "similarly , there are an additional 10 srsic bulges of disc galaxies with @xmath29 that could extend the low-@xmath0 end of the correlation .",
    "the srsic index is a slight function of the observational bandpass .",
    "this dependency of galaxy structural parameters with wavelength arises due to radial gradients in the stellar population gradients and/or dust obscuration @xcite .",
    "we therefore plan to perform accurate galaxy image decompositions for all the galaxies belonging to the sample of @xcite  with a directly measured smbh mass  to explore the @xmath2 relation and other black hole mass scaling relations in a homogeneous analysis ( same observational bandpass and same light profile decomposition method ) .    finally , we compare the results from this work with those from @xcite , highlighting two main points .",
    "first , and similar to our sample , the galaxy sample used by @xcite was dominated ( @xmath3280% ) by disc galaxies in the low - mass end ( @xmath33 ) and by elliptical galaxies ( @xmath3280% ) in the high - mass end ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "second , @xcite measured a srsic index greater than 10 for three spheroids with @xmath35 , which are absent in figure [ fig : mbhn_fit]b .",
    "combining the different galaxy types and fitting a single relation , it is easy to understand why a quadratic relation would be more appropriate than a single log - linear relation to describe their data . at @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) ,",
    "their quadratic relation has a slope of @xmath38 , similar to that observed for our srsic bulges .",
    "the @xmath2 relation @xcite is important for any complete theory or model to describe the coevolution of galaxies and smbhs .",
    "it also provides a means to estimate black hole masses in galaxies and may prove fruitful for recent and future deep , wide - field photometric surveys of galaxies which can statistically estimate the black hole masses in a large sample of galaxies up to @xmath39 .",
    "the main motivation of this work was to re - investigate the @xmath2 relation , given a recent spate of papers which did not detect it .",
    "we have gone beyond the simple recovery of the @xmath2 relation , and explored potential substructures in this diagram in terms of distinct relations for srsic and core - srsic galaxies , and for bulges and elliptical galaxies .",
    "we compiled a large collection of literature srsic index measurements @xcite for a sample of 62 galaxies with directly measured smbh masses .",
    "we compared multiple srsic index measurements which existed for 35 galaxies , and found relative differences greater than 50% in many instances .",
    "this is more than expected from a systematic bias produced by different types of light profile modelling ( 1d or 2d ) or different observational bandpasses .",
    "we therefore excluded the outlying srsic indices and averaged the remaining values .",
    "this exclusion resulted in the removal of 8 galaxies .",
    "our final sample therefore consists of 54 galaxies : among them , 27 had srsic indices measured only by one study and the remaining 27 have an averaged srsic index measurement . + our principal conclusions are :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2 diagram ( figure [ fig : mbhn_fit ] ) displays an appreciable correlation .",
    "the results from the symmetrical linear regressions ( figure [ fig : mbhn_fit ] ) are consistent at the @xmath5 level with predictions ( figure [ fig : mbhnpred ] ) obtained by combining the @xmath3 relations for core - srsic and srsic galaxies with the @xmath4 relations for elliptical galaxies and the bulges of disc galaxies .",
    "if srsic bulges and srsic elliptical galaxies follow the same @xmath3 relation , then an order of magnitude gap is expected between the smbh masses of srsic elliptical galaxies and the srsic bulges of disc galaxies having the same @xmath1 .    a wider range of srsic indices would be beneficial to put tighter constraints on the observed slopes of the correlations .",
    "the catalog of 80 directly measured supermassive black hole masses compiled by @xcite allows one to explore the @xmath2 diagram in the low- and hig - mass end .",
    "we recognize the need for a well calibrated @xmath2 relation and plan to perform accurate galaxy light profile decompositions to refine the black hole mass scaling relations .",
