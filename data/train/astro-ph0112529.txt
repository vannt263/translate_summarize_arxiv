    "clusters of galaxies are the most massive gravitationally - bound systems in the universe .",
    "because they sample the high mass end of the mass function of collapsed systems , they can be used to determine cosmological parameters such as @xmath5 ( e.g. donahue & voit 1999 ) .",
    "the largest clusters ( @xmath6 ) , are the products of the collapse of matter from a very large volume of space ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "therefore they are thought to be `` fair samples '' of the universe  that the mass to light ratio or the baryonic mass fraction defined within the domain of a cluster of galaxies is representative of that ratio in the universe as a whole .",
    "they are purported to be `` closed boxes '' to star formation and evolutionary processes that occur within their domain . in this paper",
    "we present and analyze the catalogs from our joint optical - x - ray search for clusters of galaxies .",
    "we conducted this survey in order to provide a sample of clusters to test such assumptions about clusters of galaxies and to investigate the impact of sample selection on studies of cluster evolution and the evolution of their member galaxies .",
    "understanding cosmological or galaxy evolution studies of clusters critically requires an understanding of the biases in any sample of clusters .",
    "for example , the evolution of the number density of systems with cluster - sized masses as a function of mass and redshift is a fundamental prediction of cosmological structure formation models . to know the number density of clusters",
    ", we must know the biases inherent in how we find them , preferably as a function of cluster mass .",
    "furthermore , testing the `` fair sample '' hypothesis requires reliable and unbiased selection of the most massive clusters .",
    "ever since abell ( 1958 ) and zwicky ( herzog , wild & zwicky 1957 ; zwicky 1961 ) began publishing catalogues of optically selected clusters of galaxies , the definition of a cluster and the definition of biases inherent in the cluster detection process have been lively topics of debate . in 1978 , the launch of the first x - ray imaging telescope , the einstein observatory , began a new era of cluster discovery , as clusters proved to be luminous ( @xmath8 ) , extended ( @xmath9 mpc ) x - ray sources , readily identified in the x - ray sky .",
    "the intracluster gas , in nearly hydrostatic equilibrium with the gravitational potential of the cluster , radiates optically thin thermal bremstrahlung and line radiation .",
    "x - ray selection of clusters is more robust against contamination along the line of sight than traditional optical methods since the richest clusters are relatively rare and since x - ray emissivity , which is proportional to the gas density squared , is far more sensitive to physical overdensities than is the projected number density of galaxies on the sky .",
    "one cluster sample differs from another depending on how the clusters were detected .",
    "optical selection of clusters using traditional methods looking for overdensities of galaxy counts ( e.g. abell 1958 ) was rife with contamination problems .",
    "however , modern methods such as the `` matched filter '' algorithm ( postman et al .  1996 , p96 hereafter )",
    "provide automated , uniform detection of galaxy overdensities in deep optical images .",
    "the matched filter technique searches for local density enhancements in which galaxies follow a magnitude distribution characteristic of that expected for a cluster of galaxies .",
    "the results include statistically quantifiable estimates of cluster richness , redshift , and significance .",
    "the first x - ray selection methods using sliding boxes were optimal for point sources .",
    "thus , the detection method used to construct the extended medium sensitivity survey ( emss ; gioia et al .",
    "1990b ) was biased somewhat towards selecting clusters with high central surface brightnesses .",
    "now there are several algorithms optimized for detecting extended sources , including wavelets ( rosati et al .",
    "1995 ) and voronoi - tesselation percolation methods ( scharf et al . 1997 ) .",
    "a decade ago , optical and x - ray surveys apparently disagreed about how much clusters have evolved since @xmath10 .",
    "optical surveys indicated very little evolution since @xmath11 ( gunn , hoessel & oke 1986 ) , but the accurate measurements of survey volumes and cluster properties required for quantitative assessment of this evolution were difficult to quantify in these first high - redshift cluster surveys and the volumes were small so uncertainties were large .",
    "x - ray studies suggested modest evolution ( gioia et al . 1990a ) .",
    "the most recently compiled x - ray samples of clusters over a range of redshifts out to @xmath12 agree that the x - ray luminosity function for moderate luminosity clusters has not evolved significantly since @xmath13 ( borgani et al .",
    "1999 ; nichol et al . 1999 ; rosati et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; jones et al . 1998 ) , while the most luminous systems , contained in the emss , might have evolved somewhat ( henry et al . 1992 ; nichol et al .",
    "1997 , vikhlinin et al 1998 , 2000 ; gioia et al . 2001 ) or very little ( lewis et al . 2002 ) .",
    "more recent optical surveys for distant clusters continue to find very little evidence for cluster number density evolution at moderate redshifts ( couch et al .",
    "1991 ; p96 ) .",
    "the explanation of what may seem like a persisting discrepancy is that if any evolution exists in the x - ray cluster population , it is only occuring in the highest luminosity systems which are also the most rare systems .",
    "the optical surveys of couch et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and p96 were too small and shallow to detect the putative evolution of the rarest systems .",
    "while the most recent optical and x - ray results are now at least in statistical agreement on the question of evolution since @xmath14 , the question remains whether both techniques are selecting the same clusters .",
    "the fundamental quantity , from the viewpoint of comparison to cosmological simulations , is the cluster s mass .",
    "we do not know _ a priori _ whether optical luminosity or x - ray luminosity should be better correlated with a cluster s mass .",
    "the fundamental question , from the viewpoint of `` fair sample '' techniques of measuring universal ratios , is whether clusters are truly a `` fair sample '' .",
    "for example , m / l ratios depend on the bandpass of the light and the star formation history of the constituent galaxies .",
    "if the gas fractions or the m / l ratios vary significantly from cluster to cluster they are obviously not representative of the universe as a whole .    x - ray selection is generally thought to be superior to optical selection .",
    "observationally , the hot gas is a larger fraction of the cluster mass than the stellar mass , and the x - ray luminosity of a cluster is far easier to measure than its optical luminosity . for x - ray selected clusters , studies of gas fractions and cluster m / l ratios show that these quantitites are statistically constant ( evrard 1997 ; arnaud & evrard 1999 ; carlberg et al . 1996 ) . however , if x - ray selection biases the selection of the clusters , high - mass clusters of galaxies with low hot gas fractions ( if they exist ) would be omitted from such studies .",
    "massive clusters , under the `` fair sample '' hypothesis , should have nearly identical baryon fractions , however they are discovered .    with the rosat optical x - ray survey ( roxs ) for clusters of galaxies",
    ", we have endeavored to address such issues by obtaining optical images of complete 30 by 30 fields centered on positions of deep rosat pspc pointings .",
    "in contrast to previous rosat pspc serendipitous surveys such as those conducted by rosati et al .",
    "( 1995 , 1998 ) , jones et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , romer et al .",

    "( 1998 ) , the roxs includes optical imaging for the entire field of view of each x - ray pointing . the x - ray selection and optical selection of cluster candidates",
    "was then done independently of each other .",
    "we observed 23 rosat pointings for a total of nearly 5 square degrees in i band . for five of these fields",
    "we also obtained v - band imaging . in this paper ( paper ii )",
    "we present the catalogs , survey windowing functions , data reduction and observation details , an analysis of detection likelihoods , as well as an expanded discussion and further analysis , including numerical simulations of the survey . in  2 , we describe the x - ray field selection criteria and the optical observations . in  3 , we present the optical cluster candidates catalog , cross - identification of clusters in the v and i bands . in  4 , we present the x - ray cluster candidate catalogs and the x - ray / optical cross - identification procedure . in  5",
    "we describe properties of the cluster candidates , including the distribution of observed properties of objects in the sample , the estimated richness vs. @xmath15 , the @xmath16 vs @xmath17 color magnitude diagrams for the clusters identified in both the @xmath18 and @xmath17 bands .",
    "we discuss and summarize our results in  6 and  7 respectively .",
    "for all derived quantities , we have used @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the sample of 23 target fields were chosen from a sample of archival x - ray observations .",
    "all rosat pspc pointings with exposure times of more than 8,000 seconds and galactic latitude of @xmath22 degrees and declination @xmath23 degrees were considered for optical imaging from kitt peak .",
    "we avoided fields with bright stars @xmath24 .",
    "even so , bright stars outside the field occasionally scattered light into the field of view and stars with @xmath25 had diffraction spikes .",
    "pixels affected by bright stars and scattered light were masked in our subsequent analysis , and thus the total survey area is 4.8 square degrees , less than the nominal 5.75 square degrees that would have been covered if optical detection success were unaffected by stars .",
    "table  [ fields ] summarizes the fields observed as well as the associated data .",
    "we obtained the optical data during two observing runs at the kitt peak national observatory 4-meter telescope during march 1996 , and may 1997 .",
    "we were awarded 4 observing runs for this project , but one ( november 1995 ) was cancelled because the dome mechanism was broken and another had extremely poor weather ( november 1996 ) . therefore , the entire survey was conducted in the northern spring sky .",
    "the kpno 4-meter prime focus ccd camera t2 kb has a 16 field of view ( 0.47 \" pixel@xmath20 ) .",
    "we mosaiced @xmath26 of these fields to created full 30 by 30 fields , each centered on a deep rosat pointing , overlapping each quadrant by @xmath27 .",
    "a total of 900 seconds of exposure were obtained through the i - band filter for each rosat field quadrant .",
    "our 5@xmath28 detection limit of @xmath29 ( vega magnitude ) was sufficient to detect cluster galaxies 2 magnitudes fainter than the typical unevolved first - ranked elliptical at @xmath30 ( postman et al .",
    "for five of the rox fields , we also obtained v - band data , for a total exposure of 600 seconds for each quadrant .",
    "the data were obtained under near photometric conditions and low air masses ( @xmath31 , typically ) . when the sky was photometric , we obtained short exposures of the center of each field for calibration purposes , and thus all of our data were flux - calibrated ( see  3.1.1 ) .",
    "the filters used were the v and i filters from the harris set .",
    "the ccd images were first reduced with standard iraf tools for bias level subtraction , frame trimming , and flat - field division . a cosmic ray rejection algorithm based on median filtering techniques",
    "was used to remove cosmic rays from the images . in the first observing run , each pointing was divided into two 450 second exposures because the i - band sky was so bright that the dynamic range of the a - to - d converter was swamped .",
    "we used the two images to reject cosmic rays . for our second run",
    ", the a - to - d converter had been updated to unsigned integers , and the cosmic - ray rejection made possible with two images was determined to be of little advantage compared to the overhead time and additional data - reduction complexity .",
    "data obtained during subsequent telescope visits thus consisted of single 900-second observations .",
    "the two 450 second exposures for each quadrant obtained in earlier runs were coadded .",
    "we achieved a detection limit of @xmath32 mags in i and @xmath33 mags in v ( vega magnitudes ) .    to prepare for the galaxy catalog construction , the following processing steps as discussed in p96 were employed . a sky model for each ( coadded ) frame",
    "was created from the data to remove the remaining ccd signatures .",
    "we fit the median sky level as a function of row , and subtracted the appropriate sky components from each image row .",
    "these steps produced frames with extremely flat sky levels .",
    "here we describe the procedures and assumptions we used to create the galaxy catalog , the matched filter cluster catalog , the x - ray catalog , and the cross - identifications of probable detections of the same physical cluster system .",
    "we followed the procedures discussed in p96 to construct the galaxy catalog .",
    "a modified version of the faint object classification and analysis system ( jarvis & tyson 1981 , valdes 1982 ) was used to detect , measure , and classify objects in the calibrated ccd images . the detection algorithm estimated a point spread function ( psf ) for each frame , to compensate for seeing variations from exposure to exposure . to separate stars from galaxies ,",
    "focas classification parameters were chosen to cover psf variations but to be robust to star - galaxy distinctions .",
    "perfection in distinguishing galaxies from stars is not critical to our experiment since galaxies dominate the detected object counts in the magnitude range of interest ( p96 ) .",
    "astrometric calibration was performed by selecting unsaturated bright stars .",
    "the j2000 celestial positions of the stars were measured from the digitized sky survey ( the `` quick v '' survey , epoch 1983 ) based on palomar observatory schmidt plates ( lasker et al .",
    "an astrometric solution was computed based on a 6-term per coordinate polynomial for each field .",
    "typical solution uncertainty is @xmath34 .",
    "the absolute photometry for johnson v and cousins i fluxes was obtained using harris v and i - band observations of landolt standards fields pg1047 + 003 , 1159 - 035 , sa107 , and pg1657 + 078 ( landolt 1992 ) . for our figures and tables",

    "clusters were identified by searching for the local maxima within a moving box which was @xmath40  mpc across .",
    "a candidate cluster was registered when the central pixel in the box was the local maximum and it lay above a prescribed threshold .",
    "we used the following cluster detection parameters and cluster assumptions to generate the cluster catalog .",
    "the slope of the radial filter profile was 1.40 .",
    "a cluster core radius of @xmath41 kpc was assumed , and the smoothed map was sampled every 0.50 core radii .",
    "the cut - off radius for cluster detection was set to @xmath42 kpc , with a detection box half - width of @xmath43 kpc .",
    "the profile kernel halfwidth was 20 map pixels , defined by the 0.50 core radius for each map , the catalog scale was 1 arcsecond / unit , and the ccd scale was 0.45 arcsecond / pixel . for the luminosity function filter we assumed a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) with @xmath44 in the v band and @xmath45 in the i band with a slope of -1.10 for both bands .",
    "each cluster candidate is assigned a central position , effective radius ( corresponding to the area of detection equal to @xmath46 ) , an estimated redshift based on the best - fit luminosity function , an average galaxy magnitude ( @xmath47 or @xmath48 depending on the bandpass ) , and a detection confidence in units of sigma ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the algorithm also estimates an effective optical luminosity @xmath49 , which corresponds to the equivalent number of @xmath50 galaxies in the cluster such that the optical cluster luminosity @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the absolute magnitude of the sun in the appropriate band ( p96 ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath49 is relatively insensitive to @xmath53 ; variations @xmath54 were measured if @xmath55 rather than 1.0 . for reference ,",
    "a richness class 1 cluster at @xmath56 had @xmath57 in the i - band ( p96 ) .",

    "we describe the comparison of the cluster candidate catalogs resulting from the matched filter algorithm for the i - band data and the v - band data that we obtained for five of the roxs fields .",
    "we find that 60 - 65% of the clusters identified in the i band are also detected in the v - band with similar estimated redshifts if we exclude all candidates with high redshift estimates ( @xmath58 ) .    for five fields ( table  [ fields ] )",
    ", we obtained v - band images , with a source detection limit @xmath59 magnitudes within an exposure time of @xmath60 seconds .",
    "we used the matched filter algorithm , adjusted for the v - band to provide appropriate estimated redshift estimates and @xmath49 , to provide an independent sample of optical candidates . in the five fields",
    ", we found 46 v - band candidates with a detection confidence of @xmath2 and 33 i - band candidates with a @xmath2 confidence .",
    "when we cross - identify the candidates from the i - band and the v - band , we find that of the 33 i - band candidates , there are positional matches for 15 candidates with one or more v - band candidates ( table  [ vi ] ) .",
    "all but one of these 15 candidates also match in estimated redshift ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "regions in the v - band images containing 6 i - band candidates were seriously affected by scattered light or bright stars  a more serious observational effect at v than at i. therefore , a maximum of 27 of the i - band clusters could have been detected in v band .",
    "of those 27 , 4 were high redshift candidates ( @xmath62 ) , leading to a v - band detection rate of @xmath63 i - band candidates of 15/23 or 65% ( table  [ crossid_tab ] ) .",
    "the failure to detect high - redshift i - band candidates in the v - band is not unexpected since the 4000-angstrom break spectral feature would make the elliptical galaxies in such clusters , even if the clusters are real , very difficult to see in the v - band .",
    "additionally , the matched filter algorithm reliability degrades rapidly for our i - band data at redshifts greater than @xmath64 because that is where the faint end of the luminosity function is severely truncated by the survey magnitude limit . in this regime ,",
    "corrections for the missing optical light are only mildly reliable and the result is a significantly higher error in the derived @xmath49 value .    correspondingly , of the 46 v - band candidates , 18 had one or more counterparts in the i - band ( 20 with a detection significance @xmath65 ) , and only 2 candidates were undetectable because of stray light in the i - band image , for a detection fraction of 18/44 or 41% .",
    "this detection fraction has been diluted by many high redshift v - band candidates with no i - band counterparts ( 15 with @xmath58 ) .",
    "we suspect that all of the 17 @xmath58 v - band candidates may be spurious . of the two high redshift",
    "v - band candidates with plausible i - band counterparts , one has a loose association with a @xmath30 i - band candidate ( 120436.7 + 280520 , oc4 in the 1202 + 281 field ) and the other ( 154923 + 212325 , oc3 in the 3c324 field ) has an estimated redshift of 0.7 from the i - band data , compared to the v - band estimate of 1.2 .    we expect that the reliability of the matched filter method may become poor for the highest estimated redshifts , especially in the v - band for the following reasons . at the highest redshifts ,",
    "the luminosity function filtering algorithm in the matched filter cluster detection method is only sensitive to the brightest galaxies in a cluster , especially for the v - band where k - correction effects are strongest .",
    "moreover , the contrast of the most distant clusters against the foreground / background galaxy population becomes very weak , especially at bluer wavelengths due to the combination of k - correction effects and the steeper number counts of faint field galaxies ( themselves potentially clustered ) at bluer wavelengths .",
    "we can therefore provide plausible explanations for many if not all of the failures to cross - correlate between i - band identifications and v - band identifications ( table  [ vinot ] ) by a cluster candidate ( either in i or v ) with a high estimated redshift which may be a warning flag for unreliable or weak detections , or by obscuration or confusion with scattered light or spikes from bright stars .",
    "our resulting efficiency in cross - identifying clusters in either v - band or i - band is @xmath66 , for candidates with estimated redshifts of @xmath63 and if we correct for the candidates which are detected through one filter but undetectable in the other because of scattered light .",
    "we present a summary of our numbers in table  [ crossid_tab ] .",
    "we can not explain the failure to detect 8 i - band cluster candidates of moderate redshift in v. four of these candidates have possible v - band counterparts with redshifts from the v - band data similar to those derived from the i - band data , but with low detection significance or with centroids separated by @xmath67 .",
    "these possible counterparts are listed in table  [ vi ] .",
    "we also can not explain the lack of an i - band counterpart for 11 v - band cluster candidates of moderate redshift ( as in i band , 3 of these candidates have low significance counterparts or widely separated i - band counterparts with similar redshift estimates ) .",
    "we note that while the detection significance of these unmatched cluster candidates is similar to the rest of the sample ( not much dynamic range ) , the estimated richnesses tend to be rather low @xmath68 , mostly @xmath69 .",
    "we could be seeing incompleteness effects rather than spurious effects at lower @xmath49 , but it is possible that some of these unconfirmed cluster candidates are false .",
    "if we count only the most secure cross - identifications , the i- and v - band cross identification statistics imply a spurious fraction of @xmath70 for matched filter candidates with estimated cluster redshifts of less than one  consistent with the estimates of the spurious fraction of 25 - 30% from the deeprange survey ( postman et al 1998b ) , with simulations done in p96 and in postman et al ( in preparation ) , and with spectroscopic observations ( for @xmath71 ) in postman et al .",
    "( in preparation ) .",
    "the spurious fraction for candidates with estimated redshifts larger than one is completely unknown since no candidate with @xmath72 in one bandpass has a secure counterpart in the other bandpass .",
    "comparison of matched filter results from the i and v band do not address important sources of spurious cluster candidates , such as unbound aggregates of galaxies seen in a `` pole - on '' filament .",
    "both the i- and v - band data would be contaminated by such structures .",
    "for this reason , comparision of the matched filter method with x - ray observations and other cluster detection methods , such as sunyaev - zeldovich or weak - lensing observations and spectroscopy of member galaxies is critical . with roxs",

    "these sources matched very nearly one - to - one to sources available in the wgacat ( white , giommi , angelini 1995 ) , so we do not list them here .",

    "as reported in paper i , of the 57 x - ray candidates , 43 would have been visible on our optical frames ( that is , not obscured by bright stars or scattered light ) . of the 43 , 29 were visually identified with potential cluster candidates with centroid separations of @xmath92 or with significant contour overlap , of which 26 are very secure ( separations @xmath93 or visual confirmation of x - ray and optical correspondence of somewhat complex structure ) .",
    "the other three less secure identifications are more questionable affiliations of sprawling optical galaxy systems or filaments with a more compact x - ray cluster candidate .",
    "one such x - ray candidate , a confirmed cluster at @xmath94 , ms1201 + 283 or abell 1455 , does not have a formal optical counterpart , but has up to 3 optical possible counterparts based on a visual inspection of the field .",
    "the optical field around this cluster was cut - up by bright stars , and the matched filter seems to have detected individual cluster candidates in the remnants .",
    "the remaining 14 x - ray cluster candidates can be divided into 3 categories .",

    "the other two categories contain sources that have a lower probability of a true cluster : double sources and sources with very uncertain x - ray fluxes ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "there are two double sources without optical counterparts , and six sources with uncertain x - ray fluxes .",
    "only two of the optically - blank x - ray sources have yet been classified or confirmed at other wavelengths .",
    "one source ( rxj1256.9 + 4720 ) is tentatively associated with 3c280 , the target of the original observation . here",
    "we count this x - ray detection as an x - ray cluster candidate but not an optical cross - identification .",
    "it was the original target ; this correspondence is the only example of the original target coinciding with a cluster candidate .",
    "the statistics are not skewed by the inclusion of this one very interesting cluster candidate .",
    "there was a @xmath97 detection at this position in the optical data .",
    "the estimated optical redshift ( @xmath98 ) was so remarkably close to that of 3c280 s spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath99 ) that we quote the matched - filter parameters of the optical candidate despite our extremely low confidence in its reality .",
    "we note that the 3c280 cluster only has one redshift in - hand , and a preliminary investigation of the chandra image of this source shows x - ray structure associated with the radio source but no obvious cluster emission ( m. donahue , private communication . )",
    "the other candidate , rxj1120.0 + 2115 , was flagged as a double source ; rosati and his collaborators have found a cluster with @xmath100 ( p. rosati , private communication ) .    since the spurious fraction typical of the x - ray surveys is @xmath101 ( rosati et al .",
    "1998 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "1998 ) , approximately 6 of the 57 sources are expected to be false  x - ray sources which are not really extended or are constellations of point - like x - ray sources . some of these candidates may be bona fide , albeit optically - faint clusters .",
    "truly high redshift clusters are very faint in the i - band because of the 4000   break in elliptical galaxy spectra . near ir imaging",

    "we list the candidates in table  [ z ] .",

    "the redshift estimated by the matched filter algorithm has proven to be surprisingly good for the clusters of galaxies , at least for the x - ray selected clusters ( table  [ z ] ) . for 7 out of 11 extended x - ray sources with spectroscopic redshifts , the discrepancies between the photometric and the spectroscopic redshift are less than @xmath103 , finer than our redshift grid . from deeprange spectroscopic",
    "followup ( postman , private communication ) , the mean difference between spectroscopic and estimated redshifts for candidates with @xmath104 is 0.04 with an rms scatter of 0.07 , based on @xmath105 clusters . the scatter for all deeprange candidates out to @xmath106 is closer to 0.15 ( postman , private communication ) .    of the five x - ray cluster candidates contained in the fields with both v - band and i - band data , all five were detected in both the v - band and i - band .",
    "in this section we discuss the cluster properties such as x - ray luminosity , estimated for the cluster candidates in our samples .",
    "we find that while the cluster candidates in the roxs sample have x - ray and optical properties consistent with the range of properties in other cluster samples , the clusters are somewhat less x - ray luminous , optically poorer , and have much less prominent sequences of red galaxies in color - magnitude diagrams than the typical rich and massive clusters of galaxies found in all - sky surveys .",
    "this sample thus may include cluster candidates that may be missed in pure x - ray , optical , or color searches for clusters .",
    "we make what may seem a pedantic distinction here : these clusters may be missed by a search not because the sample is incomplete , but because their properties fall outside the boundary of the sample selection function .      here",
    "we show that the cluster luminosities are typical , with estimated bolometric @xmath107 , and that the upper limits are all @xmath108 .",
    "however , a couple of rich optical candidates are found with very low x - ray upper limits .",
    "the x - ray luminosity for each cluster candidate with an optical counterpart was computed assuming the matched - filter estimate for the cluster redshift , the x - ray flux from the wavelet detection algorithm , and a self - consistent bolometric correction commensurate with the x - ray temperature @xmath109 implied by the @xmath110 relation from markevitch ( 1998 ) .",
    "the @xmath110 relation is nearly constant with redshift ( donahue et al .",
    "1999 ; borgani et al .",
    "the optical cluster candidates which were not detected in the x - ray band all have x - ray upper limits from a @xmath78 aperture ( see   [ xdetupplim ] ) , ranging from @xmath111 ( the bolometric corrections for the upper limits were computed assuming an x - ray temperature of @xmath112 kev and the estimated redshifts ) .",
    "a mean @xmath113@xmath114 column density for high galactic latitudes was assumed for all luminosities and upper limits . in figure",
    "[ lx_dist ] , we have plotted the distribution of estimated x - ray luminosities of cross - identified clusters and the upper limits of the optical candidates without x - ray counterparts . note that none of the clusters are extremely luminous ( @xmath115 ) and that none of the x - ray candidates has an x - ray luminosity upper limit significantly below a @xmath116 . since this limit is approximately the luminosity of poor clusters , our x - ray data are not quite sensitive enough to rule out the presence of an x - ray group or low - luminosity x - ray cluster .",
    "however , a significant number of the optical candidates ( 54 ) have flux limits and estimated redshifts which imply x - ray cluster luminosities which are between @xmath117 , typical of luminosities of poor clusters of galaxies and even groups ( figure  [ lx_dist ] ) .",
    "two such cluster candidates , with redshifts of 0.4 and 0.3 respectively , have @xmath118 ( relatively rich ) and upper limits on @xmath119 , clusters ( oc1 ) 1118 + 2107 and ( oc6 ) 1024 + 4707 ( see figure  [ lowxhigho ] for the i - band images of these candidates . ) the optical detection significance for each of these two clusters was @xmath120 .",
    "if these clusters turn out to be x - ray faint ( @xmath15 significantly lower than that predicted by the @xmath110 or @xmath121 relations for clusters ) , that would argue that x - ray surveys could miss some relatively massive systems",
    ". such a hypothesis would be straightforward to test with xmm or chandra x - ray imaging observations , alongside ground - based galaxy spectra to confirm the redshift and establish a velocity dispersion .",
    "here we show that the x - ray luminosities and optical richness of the roxs clusters are in the expected range and ratios typical of clusters of galaxies ; however , as expected , the roxs clusters are on average fainter in x - rays than those clusters selected from a very large area x - ray survey at much shallower x - ray flux depths .    in paper i ( donahue et al .",
    "2001 ) we evaluated the relationship between the x - ray luminosity @xmath15 and the estimate of optical luminosity @xmath49 and while we found a marginally statistically significant correlation between these two properties , independent of estimated redshift , we also demonstrated that this relationship has significant scatter beyond that indicated by the estimated observational uncertainties .    to further investigate the relationship between the x - ray and optical properties of the roxs we have compared the x - ray luminosities or upper limits and optical richnesses with those obtained from the abell clusters composing the x - ray brightest abell - type cluster survey ( xbacs ) rosat survey of ebeling et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "the xbacs survey is composed of the abell clusters detected in the northern portion of the rosat all - sky survey , and therefore contains many high luminosity clusters of galaxies . since",
    "such clusters are extremely rare , they are not expected in much smaller surveys such as ours .",
    "however , the x - ray luminosities spanned in roxs are also spanned in the xbacs coverage , albeit for lower - redshift clusters .",
    "we have combined the 283 xbacs x - ray luminosities with the abell richness number counts @xmath122 from the abell / aco catalogue . for comparison to the roxs",

    "we use a relatively crude conversion from @xmath49 to abell counts ; @xmath125 , where the factor 0.72 converts galaxy counts from within a @xmath124h@xmath20mpc radius to a 1.5h@xmath20mpc radius ( p96 ) .    in figure  [ lxrich ]",
    "panel ( a ) the x - ray luminosity ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev , converted to @xmath126 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 , @xmath127 ) is plotted against @xmath128 for all xbacs clusters ( open circles ) and for all roxs optical candidates with x - ray counterparts ( filled circles ) .",
    "the uncertainties in the x - ray luminosities of roxs clusters ranges from @xmath129 to @xmath130 . in figure  [ lxrich ]",
    "panel ( b ) the xbacs clusters are again plotted , but now with the upper limit on x - ray luminosities for all non - x - ray detected roxs cluster candidates . the resulting relationship between abell richness number counts and x - ray luminosity for roxs plotted in figure  [ lxrich ] has large scatter , a result consistent with our conclusions from paper i ( donahue et al . 2001 ) and also with results from borgani & guzzo ( 2001 ) , which we will discuss later .",
    "it is also clear for both the x - ray detected and non - detected objects that the roxs criteria tend to include more x - ray - poor systems than the abell / aco catalogue intersection with the xbacs .",
    "the xbacs half - sky survey has sufficient sky coverage and depth to find more luminous clusters , but it is not deep enough to detect proportionally as many x - ray faint clusters as are found in the roxs survey . as we will also show in our red sequence analysis in",
    "  [ redseq ] , the cluster candidates that we sample here are all likely to be somewhat lower in mass than their massive , x - ray luminous cousins found in surveys of larger sky area .",
    "the general form of the @xmath131 relationship of the roxs cluster candidates is qualitatively similar to that found for the low-@xmath15 clusters in the xbacs ,      one goal of our survey was to see whether a criterion of requiring cluster x - ray candidates to have significant extent in the rosat pspc image filtered out clusters with x - ray emission too compact to be unambiguously resolved .",
    "such a criterion could screen out high redshift sources or sources with prominent cooling flows .",
    "since we were imaging complete fields we could investigate whether x - ray point sources , ignored by some cluster surveys , could actually be high - redshift or compact clusters .",
    "of the 142 optical candidate clusters with a detection confidence of @xmath2 , 27 have extended x - ray counterparts ( one has two counterparts ) .",
    "up to twenty - nine additional optical candidates have possibly interesting x - ray point sources either near the central core of galaxies ( within 1-2 ) or near a possible cluster member .",
    "when an x - ray point source is near an optical candidate , we have indicated so in the comments column of table  [ optical ] .",
    "for example , in the field of mkn  78 , oc2 has a point source very close to it , rxj0741.7 + 6525 , an active galaxy with a redshift of 1.65 ( rixos f234_001 , with mg ii and ciii emission seen by puchnarewicz et al .",
    "the estimated redshift of the cluster , however , is 0.4 . in the field of 10214 + 4724 , oc10 ( @xmath132 ) is a compact optical candidate that is exactly coincident with the point source rxj1025.4 + 4716 ; such exact alignments are worth investigating .",
    "however , most of the point sources with positional coincidence with optical cluster candidates were not exact ; coincidental alignments are likely , given the size of a typical cluster candidate .",
    "the number of coincidences between point sources and optical cluster candidates in our survey can be estimated by assuming that a typical optical cluster candidate has a radius of @xmath133 , and that the x - ray point source density at the 0.2 - 2.0 kev flux limit of @xmath134 is 100 sources deg@xmath135 ( rosati et al .",
    "with 142 optical candidates , the estimated number of chance coincidences is 34 , comparable to the number that we identify .",
    "therefore we do not detect a significant excess of x - ray point sources near optical cluster candidates .    in order to see",
    "whether the correspondence with point sources increased when we applied our judgement as to the reality of a cluster candidate , we visually inspected each optical candidate and assessed a subjective believability index to it , of `` probable '' , `` blend '' , or `` unlikely '' .",
    "this subjective assessment showed that many of the optical candidates are likely to be blends with other optical candidates at different redshifts .",
    "lacking a purely objective means of sorting out blends , we have listed all blend candidates with notations in the comments column ( table  [ optical ] ) .",
    "some 57 out of the 142 optical candidates without x - ray counterparts passed this subjectivity test ; 17 of these may have associated point sources .",
    "the fraction of optical candidates without extended x - ray counterparts but with possible x - ray point source counterparts did not increase significantly with this subjective assessment .",
    "therefore , we suspect that most of these associations are likely to be random projections of background agn with the optical candidates .",
    "we note the fraction of optical candidates which have x - ray counterparts or which are deemed believable in a subjective assessment is a strong function of detection confidence ( @xmath28 ) and estimated redshift .",
    "the percentage of x - ray clusters plus `` probable '' optical clusters is 70% of the total at @xmath136 , dropping to 45% at @xmath137 , and @xmath138 at @xmath139 ( figure  [ redshifts]a and  [ sigdist ] ) .",
    "the same fraction as a function of @xmath49 ( figure  [ redshifts]b ) does not vary as strongly as it does with detection confidence ( @xmath28 ) and estimated redshift , presumably since @xmath49 is a measure of cluster richness ( and richer clusters are in general more powerful x - ray sources and may subjectively look more `` probable '' ) but candidates with higher @xmath49 also tend to have higher estimated redshifts ( and thus are harder to detect by x - ray methods and are less likely to be assessed as `` probable '' in a subjective review of the optical data .",

    "we compare the properties of the x - ray detected cluster candidates with those which had no x - ray counterparts ; we find that the optical and x - ray surveys were well - matched in terms of depth and sensitivity .    as described previously and in paper i , each optical cluster candidate was assigned an estimated redshift and a @xmath49 from the best - fit luminosity function by the matched filter algorithm .",

    "if no matching x - ray cluster existed , we compared the cluster centroid positions in v and i to determine the optical cluster location .",

    "using an empirical relationship between cluster luminosity and x - ray core radius ( assuming a standard king profile for cluster density ) of : @xmath185h@xmath186 mpc h@xmath20 ( jones et al 1998 ) , we derive the angular size of the x - ray cluster .",
    "the x - ray selection functions for the simulation are essentially the same as the x - ray selection functions in figure  [ x - raysel ] in   [ xraycat_sect ] , except for the simplifying notion that all clusters were observed on - axis by the rosat pspc .",
    "cluster luminosities are converted to the x - ray detection band ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) assuming a constant 4  kev thermal spectrum , which is a reasonable approximation for our observed sample .",
    "clusters are entirely discarded which fall outside of the @xmath187 range of the roxs .",
    "clusters which are only detected in either the x - ray or optical , but not both , are flagged .",
    "those detected only in the optical are then assigned an x - ray flux upper - limit ( and x - ray luminosity upper limit ) based on the mean x - ray flux limit of the roxs ( @xmath188 erg s@xmath20 @xmath81 0.5 - 2 kev ) .",
    "finally , the @xmath49 for each cluster is assigned an observational error as a function of redshift , based on the known error distributions of the matched - filter algorithm , which correspond to @xmath189% errors for @xmath190 and @xmath191% errors for @xmath58 ( p96 ) .",
    "we are therefore left with four datasets : joint x - ray and optical detected clusters , optically detected clusters with x - ray upper limits , x - ray detected but not optically detected clusters , and entirely undetected clusters .    in figure  [ sima ] we plot the results for a simulated dataset where @xmath192 ( the fiducial relationship expected under basic assumptions ) and that the @xmath193 scatter is zero .",
    "observational errors are still included in @xmath183 , so some spread is still seen .",
    "the total number of systems is arbitrary , but chosen here for clarity of presentation .",
    "it is immediately apparent that this particular simulation does not qualitatively agree with the observations , both in the shallowness of the relation and in the scatter between @xmath15 and @xmath183 .",
    "the relative numbers of joint , only optical , or only x - ray detections are also in strong disagreement with observations .",
    "we observe approximately 4 cluster candidates in the roxs which are only detected optically for every 1 cluster which is jointly detected , and no more than 3% of all candidates are solely x - ray candidates . in the simulation of figure  [ sima ] the mean numbers of detections ( over 10 runs ) yields a straight 1:1 ratio between jointly detected and optically detected clusters , at odds with the real roxs , although the fraction of the purely x - ray detected numbers are consistent and are at about the 3% level . adding a significant intrinsic scatter ( @xmath19428% of the normalization @xmath182 ) to the @xmath169 relationship",
    "does not alter these results .",
    "in contrast , in figure  [ simb ] we plot the results for @xmath195 and an intrinsic scatter of @xmath19439% . it is apparent that there is much better qualitative agreement between this simulation and the roxs results .",
    "furthermore , the relative numbers of x - ray vs. optical cluster detections are now in much better agreement . the simulation yields a 4 to 1 ratio for optical detections vs joint detections , and a pure x - ray detection rate of 1 - 2% .",
    "interestingly , a steeper relationship ( @xmath196 ) appears to be less successful at reproducing the roxs observations , even when we adjust the allowed scatter .",
    "typically , the number of optical - only detections are overproduced by at least a factor of 2 in such tests .",
    "we note here that the simulations are seriously limited in their ability to provide a faithful reproduction of the actual roxs data .",
    "this limitation is for a variety of reasons . without much greater complexity",
    "we can not mimic the details of the x - ray selection , namely the variation in detection sensitivity as a function of off - axis position in the rosat fields , and the detailed variations in field exposure times and backgrounds .",
    "we are also reliant on the @xmath183 selection functions , which are known to suffer increasing uncertainties with @xmath178 .",
    "the basic findings are however clear .",
    "the @xmath197 relationship must be steeper than @xmath198 , and the intrinsic scatter between @xmath15 and @xmath183 must be large - these are _ not _ due to systematics in the observations .",
    "a somewhat more quantitative evaluation of the simulation results is summarized in figure  [ simc ] .",
    "we have applied a 2d k - s test ( press et al 1997 ) to the roxs joint detections ( x - ray and optically detected clusters ) and the equivalent simulation outputs for a range of parameters in the @xmath199 relation .",
    "specifically , we have chosen a fixed instrinsic fractional dispersion in this relation such that the @xmath200 width is 100% when the normalization @xmath182 is 50 and approximately 30% when @xmath201 .",
    "we have then varied @xmath182 and set @xmath202 to @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 . in figure  [ simc ] ( upper panel )",
    "we plot the resultant 2d k - s probabilities .",
    "these should be considered only in relation to each other rather than as absolute indicators of a ` goodness - of - fit ' .",
    "the higher the probability the more significant the agreement between distributions .",
    "it is apparent that when @xmath206 the agreement between the roxs and the simulations is never very good , but does seem to peak around @xmath207 . in constrast , for @xmath208 , the agreement appears best for low @xmath182 , comparable to @xmath206 for @xmath209 and significantly worse for @xmath210 .",
    "variations as large as 50% in the intrinsic scatter used in the simulations do not significantly alter these results .",
    "however , as described above , visual inspection of the data in the @xmath169 panel reveals that the 2d k - s test may be somewhat misleading , and in fact neither the low-@xmath202 results at low @xmath182 or the @xmath206 results at @xmath211 would be classed as very good fits ` by - eye ' .",
    "for example , when @xmath206 the simulated and observed distributions overlap only at the lower @xmath15 end , which boosts the k - s probability relative to @xmath212 , although the latter distribution is better aligned , its overlap is smaller .",
    "the situation is considerably clearer when we also take into account the number ratios of joint detections versus optical only detections ( as discussed above ) . in figure  [ simc ] ( lower panel )",
    "we plot the ratio of the number of joint detections to the number of optical - only detections for the 3 cases described above .",
    "we also plot the actual roxs ratio ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is immediately apparent that only the @xmath213 curves intersect the observations for reasonable @xmath182 .",
    "weighing the 2d k - s results by this additional constraint we conclude that the simulations are in best agreement with the data when @xmath214 ( since the ks probabilities are overall higher ) and when @xmath215 .",
    "@xmath216 is therefore excluded as a plausible intrinsic relationship .",
    "the optical matched - filter selection technique works well to find candidate clusters of galaxies , but the spurious fraction is high at @xmath217 , and it is demonstrably not 100% complete - it misses clusters at a rate of 10 - 20% at least . the selection window for a matched filter cluster sample is more difficult to quantify because of its sensitivity to the spectral energy distribution of the galaxies for which it is searching .    on the other hand , the x - ray selection technique , while generating fewer spurious cluster candidates ( @xmath153 ) and reliably finding the ( apparently ) more massive clusters , misses some high @xmath49 cluster candidates .",
    "we do not know yet whether these are true massive clusters or whether they are fortuitous projections of less massive systems .",
    "redshifts and x - ray observations are required to determine the nature of these candidates .",
    "zabludoff & mulchaey ( 1998 ) and mulchaey & zabludoff ( 1998 ) showed in their sample of 12 optically selected groups that groups without detected x - ray emission tend to be lower velocity dispersion systems with few or no elliptical galaxies .",
    "the undetected groups in the zabludoff & mulchaey sample may not even be bound .",
    "some x - ray observations of optically - selected , high redshift clusters have revealed such clusters to be `` underluminous '' in the x - ray ( castander et al 1994 . ) the high - significance , optically rich roxs candidates without x - ray counterparts are prime targets for observational tests whether x - ray selection indeed selects on the basis of cluster mass .",
    "the correlation of the presence of a dense , x - ray emitting intracluster media and the presence of a significant elliptical galaxy population is another testable hypothesis with further observations of the roxs sample . with the limited color information we have in hand ,",
    "we were not able to show that x - ray cluster candidates at the moderate x - ray luminosity levels available in our sample are more likely to have red elliptical sequences .",
    "but we were only able to make this test for a small number of cluster candidates , given the available photometry .    a related result from roxs",
    "is that the cluster richness @xmath123 is not well - correlated with cluster x - ray luminosity , a result which is supplementary to our result in paper i regarding cluster x - ray luminosity and the @xmath49 richness parameter .",
    "the clusters in our sample are on average poorer and less massive than those found in a half - sky survey ( e.g. xbacs ) , owing to the smaller sky area and greater depth of our survey . for @xmath218 , donahue et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggested that the joint redshift and @xmath49 distribution arises from the population of x - ray clusters with a steep dependence between @xmath15 and @xmath49 .",
    "equivalently , we show here that we can also reproduce this joint distribution with a large scatter between @xmath15 and @xmath49 in monte - carlo simulations of the roxs .",
    "a correlation between cluster x - ray luminosity and cluster richness has been suspected at least since jones & forman ( 1978 ) plotted cluster richness class against x - ray luminosity for nearby ( @xmath219 ) clusters .",
    "but even in their sample , a @xmath220 cluster is equally as likely to have a cluster richness of 0 as it is 2 or 3 .",
    "only the most luminous clusters ( @xmath221 ) had cluster richnesses reliably of 2 or 3 .",
    "the xbacs clusters ( figure  [ lxrich ] ) show this correlation and very large scatter with cluster richness .",
    "however , richness has long been a suspect observational parameter for x - ray astronomers ( e.g. mushotzky et al 1978 ) , since the measurements rely on number counts that only become more difficult to ascertain at higher redshift with the associated higher contamination levels .",
    "the matched filter method provides a possibly more robust and objective means of estimating a cluster candidate s luminosity in the form of @xmath49 , yet , this measure too is not strongly correlated with cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "the lack of strong correlation between x - ray and optical luminosity , and the large scatter of those two quantities , are confirmed by the rox survey .",
    "a review by borgani & guzzo ( 2001 ) showed that the velocity dispersions and cluster optical luminosities of an optically - selected sample of clusters are not as well - correlated as the velocity dispersions and the optical luminosities of a subsample of clusters selected for their x - ray fluxes from the original sample .",
    "the velocity dispersions of these x - ray selected clusters are even better correlated with their x - ray luminosities , suggesting that x - ray luminosity is better correlated with cluster mass than is optical luminosity .",
    "the rox survey has no such independent test of correlation with mass ; however , followup observations of this sample in the x - ray and the optical will further test the borgani & guzzo suggestion at higher redshifts .",
    "the roxs , since it is a uniformly selected sample at both x - ray and optical wavelengths , has examples of both x - ray candidates without optical counterparts and optical candidates without x - ray counterparts .",
    "both subsamples probe the extremes of the @xmath222 distribution . explaining the extremes will go a long way towards explaining why and how the emissivity of the intracluster gas is related to the light emitted by the stars in the cluster .",
    "it is particularly important to see if there is a  third parameter \" such as galaxy formation efficiency , evolutionary stage of the cluster , or galaxy morphology populations , that creates the large spread in the @xmath15 versus richness relationship for clusters , or if the large spread is due to projection effects significantly impacting the optical selection technique .",
    "one possible clue is the existence of a difference in the conclusions based on cluster contents from an optically - selected , rather heterogenous sample of clusters ( the morphs sample , in smail et al 1997 ) and those found in an x - ray selected sample of clusters by ellingson et al ( 2001 ) .",
    "the x - ray selected clusters show cores that exhibit very little evolution between @xmath179 and the present , whereas the morphs clusters show evidence that the s0 population may be turning into ellipticals during that same time .",
    "it is possible that the presence of a well - developed intracluster medium is ubiquitous in a massive cluster , but in less massive clusters , the galaxy populations are still evolving in the cluster cores .",
    "uniform morphological studies of a cluster sample diverse in x - ray and optical properties are needed to test such a statement , and such a test could be accomplished with a sample such as the roxs .",
    "rosati et al . ( 1995 , 1998 ) selected clusters for the rdcs not only for their x - ray emission , but used an extent criteria as well .",
    "there was some worry that this selection criteria may have missed the most compact x - ray clusters which remain unresolved by the rosat pspc , particularly those at high redshift .",
    "however , our survey does not reveal an obvious population of high redshift cluster candidates with x - ray point sources .",
    "the correspondence between an optical cluster and an x - ray point source is not more than we would expect by chance - therefore we do not believe we have found a population of cluster sources which would go undetected by the rosat cluster surveys which select for extent , a result consistent with the findings of the wide angle rosat pointed survey ( warps ; jones et al 1998 ) , a rosat serendipitous search which did not filter for extent .",
    "we have some examples of optical clusters with x - ray point source counterparts which could be agn in those clusters .",
    "approximately 25 of our candidates have x - ray point sources within 1-2 of the cluster centroid ; optical identification of these sources is required to ascertain whether the candidate and the point source are physically related .",
    "probably the most surprising result is that the roxs cluster candidates do not , as a rule , show distinct or strong red sequences in the color - magnitude diagrams of their galaxy populations . only about 50% of the optical cluster candidates detected in both i- and v - band show galaxy colors distinct from those of the field population .",
    "and only @xmath223 of the x - ray clusters so identified show such sequences .",
    "it is possible that the red sequence is ubiquitous in the most massive , virialized clusters .",
    "but perhaps at some unknown threshold in mass or level of virialization or luminosity , the red sequence ceases to be distinct and prominent .",
    "we plan to use the red sequence detection method ( gladders & yee 2000 ) , which does not rely on an obvious red sequence to select cluster candidates , to see what cluster candidates it finds in the roxs galaxy photometry data .",
    "the roxs sample identifies several problems that warrant further investigation :    * a red sequence is not prominent in all x - ray selected clusters . at what x - ray luminosity ( or equivalently at what mass ) does the red sequence cease to be prominent ? is the presence of a red sequence dependent on mass ? * the estimated optical luminosity and richness of a cluster are not at all well - correlated with the x - ray luminosity .",
    "there are at least three unsolved issues regarding the correlation of the optical luminosity , x - ray luminosity , and cluster virial mass : 1 .",
    "is the lack of correlation representative of the difficulties of estimating the optical luminosity or is it representative of an intrinsic variation or scatter in the m / l ratios in clusters ? 2 .",
    "if the estimated optical or x - ray luminosity , and therefore the detectability of a cluster , has enormous scatter with respect to the mass of the cluster , selection by mass using optical or x - ray light may be very difficult . knowing the scatter with respect to cluster mass with both optical and x - ray luminosity is important .",
    "individual studies show good correspondence of both quantities with velocity dispersion ( e.g. girardi et al .",
    "2000 and mahdavi & geller 2001 for @xmath224 and @xmath15 respectively ) , but a comparative analysis of the masses and luminosities of a well - chosen , homogeneous sample has not been done yet .",
    "3 .   if there is such a large intrinsic variation in the optical m / l for clusters , what evolutionary process controls this variation ? can galaxy formation efficiency or evolutionary history be so radically different from one cluster environment to another to produce this effect ? does m / l correlate with any other property of a cluster of galaxies ? * while galaxies and hot gas may trace the gravitational potentials of the most massive clusters , mergers and other physics may disrupt that correspondence .",
    "true optical condensations of galaxies with low levels of x - ray emission may be galaxies which have been temporarily separated from the hot intracluster gas while undergoing a merger event ; galaxies experience the merger as a non - collisional fluid while the gas experiences hydrodynamic effects of shocks and cooling .",
    "an observational example of such a merger is abell  754 ( zabludoff & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "studies of the roxs `` x - ray poor '' cluster candidates may reveal their true nature , whether they are mergers , minor systems embedded in filaments , or mere projection effects .    because the roxs has greater depth and smaller sky area than surveys like the emss or xbacs , the roxs clusters must be relatively low - mass clusters compared to typical clusters in those surveys .",
    "the low - mass end of the cluster mass function may be where the physics of the intracluster medium collides with the physics of star formation and galactic winds .",
    "the energy injected by stellar processes is closer to the specific energy per particle in the gravitationally bound gas of a low mass cluster of galaxies .",
    "mergers may be more common or at least more significant in the low - mass clusters  when the relative velocities of the galaxies are not much greater than the internal velocities of the galaxies , collisions and interactions are more likely to induce star formation .",
    "the least massive clusters may be the most recent members to the cluster hierarchy , whose galaxies are most recently accreted from the field .",
    "the optical and x - ray properties of such clusters may thus still be correlated , but only very weakly and with high scatter .",
    "such recent formation may explain the weakness or lack of a red sequence , which may only dominate in clusters where the oldest ellipticals formed preferentially in high density regions at an early time .",
    "the other inference possible from roxs is that at some point below a given mass on the mass scale of clusters , some treasured assumptions about clusters , their m / l constancy , the invariance of the baryon fraction in clusters , and their ubiquitous red galaxy content may break down .",
    "no single cluster selection method is perfect .",
    "multiple , complementary methods of selecting clusters may be essential for cluster studies , particularly at high redshift where all methods start to run into completeness limits , incomplete understanding of physical evolution , and projection effects .",
    "understanding the biases inherent in any cluster selection method is essential to extracting conclusions about cluster evolution or the evolution of galaxies in clusters from any cluster sample .",
    "the rosat optical x - ray survey ( roxs ) for clusters of galaxies provides a well - matched , head - to - head comparison of two of the most popular methods for finding clusters of galaxies : a matched filter in the optical and extended source detection algorithms such as the wavelet transform in the x - ray .",
    "both algorithms do seem to agree on the location of at least some of the cluster candidates in our sky coverage ; however , the overlap was far from perfect .",
    "we find that the correlation is weak between the x - ray and optical luminosity or richness of a cluster , and it has considerable intrinsic scatter .",
    "some of this scatter may arise from underestimating our observational uncertainties , but the scatter is too large for it to be accounted for by pure observational uncertainties in @xmath15 or @xmath49 ( paper i ) .",
    "we confirm these results in a numerical model of the roxs .",
    "while we did not find any bias that would affect the conclusions on the evolution of clusters of galaxies , we did find evidence for possible bias that could affect conclusions regarding galaxy evolution in clusters .",
    "x - ray and optical cluster detection techniques sample different cluster populations , a statement which should worry those who use cluster samples to make claims about galaxy evolution .",
    "we find that the red - sequence does not appear to be very strong in our cluster candidates , regardless of whether they have x - ray counterparts .",
    "we plan to do a proper red sequence detection with the roxs galaxy photometry and position data in an upcoming paper .",
    "all cluster methods have their merits ; the cluster community should consider , however , the effect of cluster selection and the measurement of cluster properties on their conclusions . the roxs has provided a number of follow - up avenues to assess in detail the real differences between cluster candidates which were detected in the x - ray and those which were not .",
    "observations to obtain the weak lensing signatures , velocity dispersions , and/or icm temperatures would provide the most fundamental property of a cluster from a cosmologist s perspective - its virial mass .",
    "confirmation of at least a subsample of the optical clusters with the faintest x - ray limits would more strongly test our working hypothesis that we have no need to invoke the presence a bi - modal population of x - ray faint and x - ray luminous clusters of galaxies at the mass scales of @xmath225 .",
    "clusters whose x - ray / optical luminosities lie outside the normal distribution could reveal clusters in early evolutionary states or clusters embedded in unusual projection with respect to filaments and other large scale structure , or they may represent a fundamental challenge to our assumptions about cluster physics and formation .    the authors would like to acknowledge the support of the nasa ltsa grant nag5 - 3257 and a stsci ddrf grant 82208 .",

    "<S> we present and analyze the optical and x - ray catalogs of moderate - redshift cluster candidates from the rosat optical x - ray survey , or roxs . </S>",
    "<S> the survey covers the sky area contained in the fields of view of 23 deep archival rosat pspc pointings , 4.8 square degrees . </S>",
    "<S> the cross - correlated cluster catalogs were constructed by comparing two independent catalogs extracted from the optical and x - ray bandpasses , using a matched - filter technique for the optical data and a wavelet technique for the x - ray data . </S>",
    "<S> we cross - identified cluster candidates in each catalog . </S>",
    "<S> as reported in paper i , the matched - filter technique found optical counterparts for at least 60% ( 26 out of 43 ) of the x - ray cluster candidates ; the estimated redshifts from the matched filter algorithm agree with at least 7 of 11 spectroscopic confirmations ( @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the matched filter technique , with an imaging sensitivity of @xmath1 , identified approximately 3 times the number of candidates ( 155 candidates , 142 with a detection confidence @xmath2 ) found in the x - ray survey of nearly the same area . </S>",
    "<S> there are 57 x - ray candidates , 43 of which are unobscured by scattered light or bright stars in the optical images . </S>",
    "<S> twenty - six of these have fairly secure optical counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the matched filter algorithm , when applied to images with galaxy flux sensitivies of @xmath1 , is fairly well - matched to discovering @xmath3 clusters detected by wavelets in rosat pspc exposures of 8,000 - 60,000 seconds . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the spurious fractions between the optical and x - ray ( 30% and 10% respectively ) can not account for the difference in source number . in paper </S>",
    "<S> i , we compared the optical and x - ray cluster luminosity functions and we found that the luminosity functions are consistent if the relationship between x - ray and optical luminosities is steep ( @xmath4 ) . here , in paper ii , we present the cluster catalogs and a numerical simulation of the roxs . </S>",
    "<S> we also present color - magnitude plots for several of the cluster candidates , and examine the prominence of the red sequence in each . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the x - ray clusters in our survey do not all have a prominent red sequence . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that while the red sequence may be a distinct feature in the color magnitude plots for virialized massive clusters , it may be less distinct in lower - mass clusters of galaxies at even moderate redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> multiple , complementary methods of selecting and defining clusters may be essential , particularly at high redshift where all methods start to run into completeness limits , incomplete understanding of physical evolution , and projection effects . </S>"
