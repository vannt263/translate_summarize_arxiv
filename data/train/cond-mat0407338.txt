    "the dynamics of granular avalanches has been keeping busy a large fraction of the granular community for several years . as an example",
    ", a recent review paper has been written by the french research group named ` gdr milieux diviss ' in order to sum up the ` french results ' of experiments and numerical simulations on steady uniform dense granular flows @xcite .",
    "some of the recurring issues addressed in this long article concern the definition and the description of the rheology and the friction law of these flows . as a matter of fact , these quantities are important physical ingredients to be plugged into the equations proposed for the modeling of these avalanches . although some alternative models are proposed  see e.g. @xcite  an interesting theoretical framework for the description of granular flows follows the st venant - like approach for thin flows in hydrodynamics , in which conservation equations are integrated over the depth of the flow @xcite .",
    "this was proposed for example by savage , hutter and co - workers for the case of the motion of grains over an inclined rough plane @xcite .    with such equations adjusted on uniform steady flows , it is for instance possible to reproduce quantitatively steady fronts of granular avalanches on a rough inclined plane @xcite .",
    "another interesting situation is that of unsteady avalanches , whose dynamics is of course more complicated to capture and is very demanding for the models .",
    "an example of such a situation is the motion of an initially confined granular mass which is released and runs down the same rough plane . in this case",
    ", the same calibration gives also quite good qualitative predictions @xcite .",
    "the spreading of a granular mass is also of interest in a geophysical context as they are a model of real cliff collapse @xcite .",
    "another famous example is the case where an initial static layer of grains is available on the plane , and avalanches triggered by a local solicitation with a pointy object @xcite .",
    "the nice experimental pictures show two types of behavior : a ` triangular avalanche ' when the thickness of the grain layer is small , and an avalanche with an ` up - hill ' propagative front when the layer is thicker .    , where @xmath2 is the tangent of the angle of repose .",
    "[ fig : setup],height=144 ]    in the present paper , our aim is also to deal with unsteady and non - uniform granular flows in a geometry close to these elementary ` response ' situations where avalanches are caused by local perturbations .",
    "more precisely , we look at the dynamical evolution of a uniform slope on which some amount of rolling grains is initially deposited locally .",
    "however , unlike the above examples , we shall focus on avalanches running over an erodible bed , i.e. an infinite grain layer for which the selected thickness of moving grains is not fixed _ a priori _ or bounded by a plane .",
    "this situation then has one extra dynamical degree of freedom .",
    "as will be made more precise in the next section , in order to close these equations it is indeed necessary to specify the shape of the velocity profile of the moving grains and to explicit the different forces acting on them .",
    "moreover , as our theoretical work aims at obtaining exact results on avalanche profiles , the analysis will be restricted to two dimensional systems for simplicity , and will be relevant for experiments in confined cells or when the perturbation has translation invariance in the direction perpendicular to the slope .",
    "st venant equations for granular avalanches on erodible beds have been recently proposed by douady _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "observations show that these avalanches consist of a thin moving layer of grains over a ( quasi)static profile @xcite .",
    "the two natural variables in this modeling are therefore the profile of the static pile @xmath1 , and the thickness of rolling grain layer @xmath0 that flow over this bed , both functions of time and horizontal position . in this framework",
    ", we shall derive two particular sets of coupled equations for @xmath0 and @xmath1 that are simple enough to be solved exactly for the ` response geometry ' described above .",
    "as will be explicited in the next section , they are based on different choices for the velocity profile in the flowing grain layer , and exhibit different non - linearities .",
    "a particular case of one of the two studied sets gives in fact the equations proposed in @xcite on more phenomenological grounds , and for which we developed an analytical treatment in @xcite using the method of characteristics .",
    "we extend here this powerful technique to all other cases as well .",
    "this technique has been also applied to a st venant like model for debris avalanches @xcite .",
    "after the derivation of these sets of equations in section [ sec : stvenant ] in which we shall specify the assumptions made , both sets of equations  corresponding to different flow profiles  are treated in the following two sections .",
    "we show the different predictions of the models , compare how the triggered avalanche dies out or grows depending whether the initial slope of the static profile is smaller or larger than the repose angle of the pile , and discuss the appearance of shocks .",
    "we finally conclude and draw perspectives on the description of avalanche fronts .",
    "the present paper is rather technical , but we hope that the scope of the method used is sufficiently broad to warrant interest in itself ; furthermore , obtaining explicit exact result for the shape of avalanche shapes and sizes gives important benchmarks to which experiments can be compared , and will eventually help selecting the correct set of hydrodynamical equations for granular avalanches .",
    "the aim of this section is to ( re-)establish coupled differential equations for the variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 introduced above and depicted in figure [ schema ] . these equations encode the conservation of the number of grains as well as their horizontal momentum @xcite .",
    "they describe how static grains may be dislodged and contribute to the flow ( erosion ) , and vice - versa how moving grains may come to rest ( deposition ) @xcite .",
    "besides @xmath0 and @xmath1 , another important field is of course the velocity in the moving layer .",
    "let us note @xmath3 the horizontal component of the velocity profile in this layer  although not explicited , time dependence of @xmath4 is understood .",
    "the averaged velocity of the flow can be defined as @xmath5 . with this quantity , the number of particles passing through a vertical line in @xmath6 during the time interval @xmath7 is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the mass density of the granular material and @xmath10 the mass of a single grain .",
    "the difference of this number in @xmath6 and @xmath11 makes the volume @xmath12 change , so that the conservation of matter reads @xmath13 in a similar way , the @xmath6-component of the momentum passing through the vertical line in @xmath6 during @xmath7 is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the average of the square of the velocity : @xmath16 .",
    "the change of horizontal momentum @xmath17 in the control volume ( see figure [ schema ] ) can then be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20component of the forces acting of this volume .",
    "( grey ) and static phase @xmath21 ( crosses ) .",
    "the grains flow from the right to the left .",
    "the dashed box is the control volume for which mass and momentum conservation laws are written .",
    "[ schema],height=240 ]    these forces are of two kinds : those coming from the lateral sides through the stress @xmath22 , and those due to the contact between the rolling and the static phase . assuming a horizontal normal stress proportional to the ` hydrostatic ' pressure @xmath23 , the corresponding force is @xmath24 .",
    "numerical simulations suggest values for @xmath25 that increase from roughly one half in static piling to unity for uniform steady flows @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the value of @xmath25 is obtain for unsteady and inhomogeneous situations from a mohr - coulomb yield criterion .",
    "it turns out that @xmath25 can increase ( decrease ) compared to unity if the grains are compressed ( decompressed ) by the flow . here",
    "we consider @xmath25 as a phenomenological _",
    "constant_. taking the difference of this force on the two sides of the control volume , the contribution of the horizontal normal stress to @xmath19 finally reads @xmath26 . to compute the other part of @xmath19",
    ", we assume that the grains in the control volume behave , with respect to the static phase , like a frictional solid ( with normal reaction @xmath27 and friction force @xmath28 ) .",
    "we call @xmath2 the friction coefficient .",
    "defining @xmath29 by @xmath30 , the balance of the weight of this volume gives @xmath31 . with @xmath32 ,",
    "the horizontal contribution of @xmath27 and @xmath28 to @xmath19 ( to the lowest order in @xmath29 and @xmath2 ) is @xmath33 . in summary , we get @xmath34    several remarks are in order at this point . first of all , we have assumed that the granular density @xmath9 is the same in the moving and the static parts , which is certainly a valid hypothesis for dense flows as considered here .",
    "more importantly , the friction coefficient @xmath2 will be taken as a constant in the following .",
    "it is however well established that there are few degrees of hysteresis between the starting and the stopping angles , which can be simply understood even at the scale of a single grain rolling down a `` pile '' consisting of a layer of regularly spaced fixed grains @xcite .",
    "as will be emphasized in the conclusion , this slight difference is of great importance when it comes to the description of regions where the moving layer is about to jam or the static bed about to move , i.e. at the feet of avalanche fronts ( @xmath35 ) . besides",
    ", it has been shown that in quasi 2d experiments conducted in a thin channel between two plates , the friction of the rolling on those plates plays a major role in the dynamics of the avalanche @xcite .",
    "such a boundary effect is not encoded here .",
    "finally , these equations will be closed by making an explicit choice for the velocity profile @xmath4 .",
    "the integrals for the computation of @xmath36 and @xmath15 will then be expressed as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "this means that we implicitly assume _ instantaneous _ adaptation of the velocity to the flow . in principle , like @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the averaged velocity @xmath36 is an independent dynamical variable whose dynamics should be described by an additional equation of ` internal force balance ' @xmath37 .",
    "the right hand side would specify the part of the forces acting on the moving layer that contribute to the acceleration and friction of the rolling grains rather than the erosion / deposition processes , i.e. , the exchange between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "a model similar to our eqs .  ( [ conservmatter ] ) - ( [ df_x ] ) has been very recently studied by khakhar et al .",
    "@xcite but for different geometries and initial conditions ( heap and rotating cylinder flows ) .",
    "their momentum balance equation has however an additional term which describes grain collisions in the mobile phase .",
    "thus they combine effects of internal dissipation @xcite and external forces as gravity and solid like friction between the two phases .",
    "two choices for the velocity profile will be investigated below : the plug flow for which @xmath38 ( named model @xmath39 for ` plug ' ) , and the situation with a linear velocity profile @xmath40 ( named model @xmath41 for ` linear ' ) . the natural selection of this profile is still a puzzling issue and is the result of several mechanisms at the grain level ( e.g. trapping ) or at larger scales ( non - local effects , clustering ) @xcite . at the phenomenological level ,",
    "the first case is reasonable for the description of thin or dilute flows ( when @xmath0 of the order of a grain diameter ) @xcite , and the second one is strongly supported by experiments and simulations performed on _ steady and deep _ 2d systems @xcite . in particular , it should be emphasized that the velocity gradient is found to be constant , and it is the thickness of the rolling layer @xmath0 which adapts its value to the external imposed shear stress , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in contrast , note that for steady granular flows on a fixed rough inclined plane a bagnold - like velocity profile @xmath42 is observed . for the study of unsteady situations ,",
    "since the static profile @xmath1 is now specified , the two st venant conservation equations can be used for the determination of the space and time evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "for a plug flow with a constant average horizontal velocity @xmath36 we trivially get @xmath43 , and one obtains from the analysis in section [ sec : stvenant ] the model    [ eq : svuconstant ] @xmath44    here the dimensionless @xmath45 , @xmath6 , @xmath0 and @xmath1 are measured in units of @xmath46 , and @xmath45 is rescaled by @xmath47 . furthermore , as we are interested in surface profiles close to the avalanche slope @xmath2 , @xmath1 is measured relative to the critical slope , i.e. , it is replaced by @xmath48 .",
    "the quantity @xmath25 is then the only free parameter of these equations . recall that an isotropic stress distribution corresponds to @xmath49 .",
    "note also that setting @xmath50 yields the so - called bcre model introduced in @xcite ( although without the diffusive terms considered there ) .",
    "any small but finite @xmath25 thus leads to novel non - linearities .",
    "before we study the propagation of a localized perturbation , as a first simple benchmark of the model , we briefly note the predictions of the model for the initial situation of a constant slope @xmath51 and a homogeneous amount of rolling grains , @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to see that in this case the thickness of the mobile layer growths ( or decays ) exponentially in time , depending on the sign of @xmath10 , with @xmath53 .",
    "the static profile is then given by @xmath54 .",
    "note that this solution does _ not _ depend on @xmath25 since @xmath55 is independent of @xmath6 .",
    "this non - linear model has been studied previously for the case of a static profile consisting of two regions of constant but different slopes and an initially homogeneous ( constant ) amount of rolling grains @xcite .",
    "however , the method of characteristic curves can be also employed to study local perturbations in form of an initially localized amount @xmath56 of rolling grains .",
    "in fact , for arbitrary initial profiles @xmath56 and @xmath57 the solution of equations ( [ eq : svuconstant ] ) with @xmath50 can be obtained analytically in implicit form . using the method of characteristic curves ,",
    "see appendix [ sec : app_cc ] , we introduce the new coordinates @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the mapping between the two coordinate systems depends on the solution for @xmath55 , @xmath21 and thus on the initial profiles due to the non - linearities .",
    "the so - called characteristic equations , which determine simultaneously the coordinate mapping and the profiles , for this model read    [ eq : bcre_b_0_ceqs ] @xmath60    with the characteristic directions given by @xmath61 the solution of these equations can be obtained explicitly ,    [ eq : bcre - map ] @xmath62    as function of these new coordinates the solution can be written in the closed form    [ eq : bcre - b=0-solution ] @xmath63,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 is lambert s function @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lambert ] .",
    "before we proceed with special choices for localized initial profiles @xmath56 , we would like to point out that the model of equations ( [ eq : svuconstant ] ) with @xmath50 can be still solved exactly if the coefficient of @xmath64 on the right hand side of both equations is a general function of @xmath55 , @xmath65 .",
    "the above case corresponds to @xmath66 .    .",
    "thin curves : small and large @xmath6 expansions @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "[ fig : lambert],height=240 ]    in order to progress with analytical techniques we make a special choice for a localized @xmath56 which allows for a closed expression for the integral of the coordinate map in equation ( [ eq : bcre - map : t ] ) .",
    "below , we will demonstrate by an explicit numerical integration of the coordinate map for a generic gaussian perturbation @xmath56 that the following results are robust with respect to the precise form of the perturbation .",
    "thus we proceed with the choice @xmath69.\\ ] ] for the initial profile .",
    "this profile decays exponentially at large @xmath70 and has a amplitude of @xmath71 . for the relevant limit of @xmath72 the width at half amplitude is @xmath73",
    "this form is adapted to the integral in equation ( [ eq : bcre - map : t ] ) since the latter equation can be written as @xmath74 and @xmath56 of equation ( [ eq : bcre - r0 ] ) has the property that @xmath75 for the static phase we will consider always a profile with a constant slope , @xmath76 where due to our definition of @xmath1 the parameter @xmath10 measures the _ excess _",
    "slope relative to the critical angle . for these initial data",

    "if characteristic curves cross each other they form an envelope . the shock position",
    "is then determined by the cusp of the envelope . while we leave the precise definition and the calculation of the envelope to appendix [ sec : app_shock ] , we discus here the criterion for the existence of shocks in our model .",
    "we are interested in not too large amplitudes @xmath71 . for @xmath107 , there is a simple condition for the formation of shocks . then it can be shown , see appendix [ sec : app_shock ] , that shocks occur only if the slope of the profile of the resting grains is larger than the critical value @xmath108 thus for broad perturbations in the moving phase shocks occur already for small slopes @xmath10 .",

    "the amplitude of the perturbation decays exponentially at large times , @xmath122 .",
    "if we define the downhill end of the bump by the condition that the maximum of the perturbation in @xmath55 has decayed to some fraction @xmath123 of the initial amplitude , then the width of the bump scales like @xmath124 for small @xmath71 since the peak in @xmath55 moves with a velocity of one",

    "it is important to note that the layer of moving grains decays to zero at large times at the uphill end of the avalanche , although the slope of the static layer is steeper than before the avalanche started .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood from the property of equation ( [ eq : svuconstant ] ) in which the exchange between the static and rolling phase is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "of course , physically , there will be a maximum angle for the stability ( even for @xmath139 ) beyond which the above predictions are irrelevant , and an extended model has to be considered .",
    "an important quantity is the total size of the avalanche . within our model , we define the size @xmath140 of an avalanche as the spatially integrated amount of mobile grains , i.e. , @xmath141 the integration can be performed for each sector separately by a change of variables to the characteristic coordinate @xmath78 .",
    "the contribution from sector ( iii ) can be neglected at larger times since the avalanche starts at @xmath142 to propagate to the left ( downhill ) , cf figure [ fig : sectors ] . for negative @xmath10",
    ", the perturbation decays exponentially , and thus we obtain for the size @xmath143 for positive @xmath10 we observe that the size of the avalanche shows a quadratic increase in time , @xmath144 at asymptotically large times .",
    "interestingly , the growth of the avalanche depends only on its initial width @xmath115 but not on the amplitude @xmath71 . by comparison with the scaling of the amplitude of the avalanche , cf equation ( [ eq : bcre_r_max ] )",
    ", we observe that the width of the avalanche must grow also linear in time @xmath145 .",

    "the resulting time evolution of a gaussian perturbation @xmath189 is shown in figure [ fig : profiles_gauss_m0_b05 ] .",
    "compared to the absence of horizontal stress , @xmath50 , there are a number of interesting novel features .",
    "the avalanche amplitude increases and the maximum is shifted downhill .",
    "the layer of static grains displays a bump at the initial position of the perturbation and a dell which propagates downhill close to the maximum of the avalanche peak . at large times , equation ( [ eq : bcre_b - finite_m - zero - map - t ] ) leads to @xmath190 which together with @xmath191 and equation ( [ eq : bcre_b - finite_m - zero - profiles ] ) yields an explicit expression for the profiles . for a small avalanche amplitude @xmath71 , the position of the peak follows @xmath192 for a gaussian @xmath56 .",
    "the maximum of @xmath55 grows linearly with time , @xmath193 , while in the absence of horizontal stress ( @xmath50 ) it remains constant .",
    "notice that this linear growth was observed for @xmath50 only at angles larger than the repose angle ( @xmath194 ) , cf equation ( [ eq : bcre_r_max ] ) .",
    "the form of the static profile @xmath21 can be directly obtained from equation ( [ eq : bcre_b - finite_m - zero - profiles - z ] ) .",
    "there are two identical contributions which are shifted relative to each other by @xmath45 . the first contribution is approximately given by @xmath195 $ ] .",
    "this term represents the bump at the start position of the avalanche .",
    "the second contribution has @xmath6 replaced by @xmath196 , corresponding to the dell traveling with the avalanche downhill , cf figure [ fig : profiles_gauss_m0_b05 ] .",
    "thus , both structures in the static layer are determined by the initial profile of the perturbation in the moving layer .",
    "it has been argued that a constant velocity profile , as assumed in the previous section , is only applicable to thin surface flow @xcite . for a thicker layer of rolling grains , the velocity should depend on the amount of mobile grains .",
    "experiments and simulations for steady deep systems suggest a linear profile for the average horizontal velocity @xmath40 of the flow . with this profile",

    "we note that for an initially uniform amount of rolling grains @xmath52 and a static sand bed with constant slope @xmath51 the solution to eqs .",
    "( [ svulinearfinal ] ) is rather simple .",

    "( [ svulinearfinal ] ) one observes that the term proportional to @xmath25 is controlled by the slope of the moving layer .",
    "since this slope becomes steeper at the downhill front with evolving time , there is an increasing thickness of the mobile layer close to the front . from a physical point of view",
    "this amplification can be understood from the effect of the horizontal stress which increases with @xmath0 .",
    "thus at the downhill front there is a net force which pushes the material towards the front and induces an extra growth of the rolling layer . as demonstrated by the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : profiles_linear_b0 ] our result is in qualitative agreement with measurements of the thickness of the mobile layer of grains along the symmetry axis of a triangular shaped avalanche moving on a static layer of limited thickness @xcite . for positive @xmath10",
    "there is , in addition to the homogeneous and linear decrease of @xmath1 , a net transport of grains of the sand bed from the downhill front to the uphill end .",
    "in this paper , we have studied two sets of st venant equations for the modeling of granular avalanches on an erodible bed .",
    "the models differ in the choice of the velocity profile within the flowing layer  either a plug flow ( @xmath39 ) or a profile with a constant velocity gradient ( @xmath41 )  which give rise to different non - linearities .",
    "these models can been solved analytically by the method of characteristics , at least for sufficiently large stress anisotropy , and we have focused our attention on the situation where a uniform static slope is initially disturbed by a localized amount of rolling grains . we were able to compute the space and time evolution of the avalanche which either dies or grows , depending on whether the initial slope is below or above the angle of repose .",
    "such unsteady and non - uniform flows are very demanding for the models as the description of fronts and the generation of shocks must be addressed . for the case of a plug flow we found that shocks occur at the uphill end of the avalanche above a positive critical value @xmath117 of the slope . below this value ,",
    "the asymptotic large time behavior can be computed , and we found that the amplitude and width of the avalanche grow linearly in time if @xmath194 , whereas for negative @xmath10 the initial perturbation decays exponentially and the width of the deposited bump of grains scales like @xmath247 . for a linear velocity profile , shocks occur for all slopes at a finite time that can be computed explicitly and is related to the shape of the initial distribution of rolling grains . by contrast to the previous case , shocks are located at the front of the avalanche .",
    "our analysis shows that these models predict several interesting qualitative features of granular avalanches , that can be compared with experiments .",
    "however , in the present form they also certainly have a number of shortcoming .",
    "the plug flow assumption , for example , is not tenable for a rolling layer thickness which starts to be of the order of several grain diameters , as particles on the top of such a layer would not feel the damping due to the friction on the static bed . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear velocity hypothesis yields a vanishing velocity @xmath248 when the thickness of the mobile layer @xmath35 , which forbids any front to move .",
    "however , shock - less and well defined propagative fronts are observed experimentally in steady @xcite or unsteady @xcite situations .",
    "our model also does not correctly account for slope hysteresis which should differentiate between a starting and a stopping angle , @xmath249 and @xmath250 , respectively .",
    "in fact , the region between @xmath250 and @xmath251 is precisely that of major interest as static slopes with an angle @xmath252 are stable but can generate growing avalanches when disturbed by a local amount of rolling grains . because the non - linear terms in model @xmath39 are all proportional to @xmath0 , spontaneous avalanches ( for @xmath139 ) can never occur whatever the value of the initial slope .",
    "this would correspond to the maximal value of @xmath253 for @xmath249 .",
    "this , however , implies that model @xmath39 can be applied to the experimentally important regime of slopes which are only slightly larger than @xmath254 and sufficiently small compared to @xmath249 . on the other hand",
    ", the uniformly growing solution for @xmath0 in model @xmath41 can be interpreted as evidence that both angles @xmath249 and @xmath250 are identical so that beyond that angle avalanches occur even at @xmath139 ( unstable slope ) .    to include the above mentioned effects in the presented models , new directions have to be proposed .",
    "first , one can modify the dynamical equations itself while keeping their general structure ( hyperbolic first order differential equations ) with its analytic properties being tractable by the method of characteristics .",
    "second , additional physical input could be used to either study the propagation of shocks beyond the shock time scale or one could implement boundary conditions on , e.g. , the slope of the profiles to describe the dynamics close to the avalanche front . to be more specific ,",
    "we discuss two points of particular interest : the velocity profile and hysteresis effects .",
    "as proposed theoretically and demonstrated by experiments , an @xmath0-dependence of the flow velocity must be kept to allow for thick avalanches .",
    "the commonly used strictly linear velocity profile with the rheological ansatz @xmath40 ( constant shear rate ) leads to problems at the avalanche front since the depth averaged velocity @xmath36 should stay finite and of the order of @xmath255 when @xmath35 .",
    "a possibility is to let @xmath201 diverge in this limit .",
    "this would correspond to a crossover from model @xmath41 to model @xmath39 below a certain small value for @xmath0 of the order of a grain diameter @xmath256 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding matching of characteristic curves is technically involved and moreover such a treatment would not provide an understanding of the physical mechanism of velocity selection .",
    "in fact , close photos of the foot of the avalanche fronts reported in @xcite show a small gas - like region where grains are ejected from the dense flow .",
    "this means that this zone is , in a sense , outside of the present modeling framework and thus could allow for a discontinuity in @xmath0 , for example , or for imposing an extra constraint on the profiles @xmath0 and @xmath1 or their derivatives ",
    "e.g. a fixed slope of the free surface as observed on propagative fronts .",
    "another more fundamental approach would be to consider the velocity @xmath36 as an independent dynamical field which a priori is not related to @xmath0 by a fixed velocity profile .",
    "such kind of description has been applied to granular flow on a _ fixed _ plane @xcite so that @xmath1 is not a dynamical quantity .",
    "another feature of sand piles that should be included in the st venant models discussed here is the hysteresis of avalanche dynamics as reflected by the existence of two critical angles .",
    "experimentally it is observed that , at least for a fixed profile @xmath1 , the critical angles are actually functions of the thickness @xmath0 of the mobile layer @xcite .",
    "since the friction coefficient @xmath2 is given by the tangent of the actual angle of the pile , a non - constant friction coefficient @xmath257 is expected .",
    "indeed , at the scale of a single grain , the starting angle depends on the depth of `` traps '' due to the roughness of the static bed @xcite .",
    "therefore one should expect an increased value of @xmath2 below a typical thickness @xmath258 ( of the order of a grain diameter ) .",
    "this increased value determines then the staring angle @xmath249 while the @xmath2 at large @xmath0 corresponds to the stopping angle @xmath250 .",
    "a sufficiently large value of the friction coefficient at small @xmath0 would lead , for the points where @xmath259 , to a `` freezing '' of the sand bed profile @xmath1 at its current value .",
    "both modifications , constraints on the profiles at the avalanche front and a friction function @xmath257 , do not change the general structure of the dynamical equations studied in the present paper .",
