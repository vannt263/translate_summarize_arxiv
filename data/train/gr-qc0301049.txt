    "a stellar mass compact object , either a neutron star or a black hole , in tight orbit around a massive kerr black hole will tumble around the massive companion due to strong spin - orbit coupling . for small mass ratios the stellar mass companion _",
    "slowly _ inspirals into the massive hole , the duration of inspiral increasing inversely as the mass ratio .",
    "gravitational waves emitted in the process of adiabatic inspiral encode the structure of the spacetime geometry around the hole thereby allowing us to test the uniqueness theorems of black holes spacetimes @xcite .",
    "however , decoding the information carried by the waves would require an accurate knowledge of how the emitted waves depend on the parameters of the system and fitting the data with the expected signal .",
    "there are problems with both of these aspects : on the one hand we do not currently have an accurate knowledge of the signal although over the next decade the situation is likely to have improved . on the other hand ,",
    "the problem of fitting is unlikely to go away as the number template waveforms required to decode the useful information might be formidably large .",
    "this is because the dimensionality of the parameter space is quite large .",
    "indeed , in the generic case of a binary consisting of two spinning black holes there are potentially seventeen parameters to fit : the direction and distance to the source , two masses , three vectors corresponding to the initial values of the orbital angular momentum and two spin angular momenta , the eccentricity of the orbit , the instant when the orbital frequency reaches a fiducial value and the phase of the signal at that instant .",
    "even though the time - structure of the signal depends on seventeen parameters , varying different parameters may not always produce distinct waveforms .",
    "in other words , the effective dimensionality of the parameter space for the purpose of fitting might be a lot smaller .",
    "for instance , we know in the case of non - spinning binaries that out of potentially eight parameters  namely , the direction to the source and its distance from the earth , two masses , an initial magnitude of the angular momentum , a fiducial time and phase when the signal reaches a certain frequency  there is effectively only one parameter with which to fit the data .",
    "this is the so - called _ chirp mass , _ which is a certain combination of the two masses of the component bodies .",
    "the detector response has no time - varying dependence on the source direction since the signal lasts for a very short duration ( minutes , at most ) and therefore does nt suffer any modulation due to the motion of the antenna that could have been useful in deciphering the source direction ; the initial magnitude of the angular momentum only sets an initial frequency of observation that is chosen by hand ; the fiducial time and phase can be easily determined by the use of the fast fourier transform and analytically , respectively ; and the phase of the signal , which is what is important in accomplishing a good fit , depends , at the dominant post - newtonian order , only on the chirp mass .",
    "although the degeneracy in component masses is resolved when higher order post - newtonian terms are included in the phasing , it turns out the number of ` independent ' shapes does nt increase significantly while including a second mass parameter .",
    "an analysis similar to the non - spinning case is required in the case of spinning black hole binaries . in this paper",
    "we discuss the method of _ principal components _ @xcite that can be used to determine the effective dimensionality of the search space",
    ". we will then apply it to the case of a test mass falling into a massive black hole .",
    "we sample the parameter space at a few crucial points to get an idea of the number of principal components on which the signal shape depends , thereby obtaining an estimate of how large the parameter space could be .",
    "we begin with a rough counting of the number of template waveforms that may be required in a fitting problem .",
    "this is really an upper limit on the number of waveforms , the actual number might be a lot less .",
    "since we expect the number of templates to be too large it will not be possible to employ matched filtering on an entire year s worth of data .",
    "rather , the idea is to employ a technique , such as time - frequency analysis , that makes little use of the signal shape in capturing a signal , albeit with a lower detection probability .",
    "such an analysis might help to first get a rough idea about the signal parameters .",
    "one could then employ matched filtering on , say a week s worth of data and refine the estimation of parameters . based on these refined parameters",
    "one finally employs the search on a year s worth of data but in a small region of the parameter space .",
    "in other words , we are advocating a multi - step hierarchical search involving different analyses techniques .",
    "in such a scheme it would only be necessary to estimate the number of templates required in the most compute intensive stage of the search hierarchy , namely in the first stage of matched filtering .",
    "it is best to begin the search from a point where the parameters can be nailed down most easily , namely by employing matched filtering on a week s worth of data .",
    "( at this stage a signal to noise ratio of about 5 - 10 can be expected for mergers taking place at a distance of about a few gpc ) .",
    "this assumption somewhat simplifies our calculation as we can neglect the motion of lisa relative to the source during this period and assume that the detector is fixed relative to the source . strictly speaking ,",
    "this is not a valid assumption but it is unlikely to change the qualitative conclusions reported in this work .",
    "to count the number of templates we must first understand how the signal evolves as a function of time . to this end",
    "we shall use the best post - newtonian order currently known but ignore eccentricity .",
    "it turns out that at this order the signal already has many modulations including spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings .",
    "therefore , the waveform should be quite suitable for counting template numbers although it may not be good enough for the purpose of fitting .      following ref .",
    "@xcite we shall use a coordinate system adapted to lisa . in the post - newtonian approximation the evolution of a binary system comprising of two bodies of masses @xmath0 and @xmath1 spins @xmath2 and @xmath3 orbital angular momentum @xmath4 is governed by a set of differential equations given by : @xmath5 \\times { \\mathbf l } v^6 \\nonumber \\\\ -\\frac{32\\eta^2 m}{5l } { \\mathbf l } v^7 , \\label{eqn : precession1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath6 v^6 , \\label{eqn : precession2}\\ ] ] @xmath7 v^6 .",
    "\\label{eqn : precession3}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational wave frequency , is the post - newtonian velocity parameter , an overdot denotes the time - derivative , @xmath10 is the total mass , and @xmath11 is the ( symmetric ) mass ratio . in the evolution of the orbital angular momentum we have included the lowest order dissipative term [ the second term containing @xmath12 in equation ( [ eqn : precession1 ] ) ] while keeping the non - dissipative modulation effects caused by spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings [ the first term within square brackets containing @xmath13 in equation ( [ eqn : precession1 ] ) ] . the spins evolve non - dissipatively but their orientations change due to spin - orbit and spin - spin couplings .",
    "though the non - dissipative terms are not responsible for gravitational wave emission , and therefore do not shrink the orbit , they cause to precess the orbit .    in the absence of spins",
    "the antenna observes the same polarization at all times ; the amplitude and frequency of the signal both increase monotonically , giving rise to a chirping signal .",
    "precession of the orbit and spins cause modulations in the amplitude and phase of the signal and smear the signal s energy spectrum over a wide band .",
    "the smearing is particularly dramatic when one of the bodies is much lighter than the other such as the inspiral of a stellar mass compact object into a massive black hole . in this case",
    "the orbit would undergo many precessions before the small object plunges into the hole smearing the signal into hundreds of frequency bins as opposed to a few frequency bins if the signal were a simple chirp .",
    "for this reason we shall call the spin modulated ( sm ) chirp , a _ smirch _ ( an anagram of _ sm _ and _ chir _ ) .",
    "the strain @xmath14 produced by a smirch in lisa is given by @xmath15 , \\label{eqn : waveform}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the precession - modulated amplitude of the signal , @xmath17 is its post - newtonian carrier phase that increases monotonically and @xmath18 is the polarization phase caused by the changing polarization of the wave relative to the antenna .",

    "these spin couplings modify the carrier phase by amounts much smaller than the post - newtonian effects so that neglecting them makes no appreciable difference to our main conclusions .",
    "to second post - newtonian order the carrier phase is given by @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{eqn : phi}\\ ] ] where @xmath32^{-1/8},$ ] @xmath33 being the time at which the two stars merge together and the gravitational wave frequency formally diverges .      from the foregoing equations we can get an idea of the number of parameters that may be needed in a search .",
    "the system we are interested in is that of a stellar mass black hole falling into a supermassive black hole wherein the mass ratio could be as low as @xmath34 .",
    "consequently , the spin of the stellar mass hole , being proportional to the square of its mass , would be negligible compared to the spin of the massive hole .",
    "further , we do nt have to specifically search for the distance to the binary nor for the fiducial time and phase when the frequency of the emitted gravitational wave reaches a certain value as they can all be measured without incurring significant computational costs .",
    "moreover , since we are focussing on quasi - circular orbits ( i.e. zero eccentricity ) and only those systems that merge within a week of observation ( i.e. after about 1000 orbital time scales ) the number of parameters in our search is down from 17 to 9 .",
    "these are the initial direction of the orbital angular momentum ( 2 angles ) , the spin of the massive black hole ( 1 magnitude and 2 angles ) , the masses of the two bodies ( 2 numbers ) and the direction to the source ( 2 angles ) .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction we do nt expect both masses to be important but only a combination  the _ chirp mass _ @xmath35 .",
    "the azimuth angles are normally not important in a search but co - latitudes would lead to modulations that can not be easily searched for . consequently , out of the six angles we expect only three to be important .",
    "( note that due to different orientations of the binary and the antenna these angles get mixed up and therefore azimuth and co - latitudes are not well - defined .",
    "however , we expect certain combinations of these angles to play the roles of azimuth and co - latitude .",
    "our claim is that three of those combinations would be important in a search and the other three not so important . )",
    "in addition , we expect the spin magnitude of the hole to be a search parameter although this would be important only when @xmath36 is close to 1 . as a result",
    "the number of search parameters would be five or less .",
    "precisely how many would have to be determined by a more rigorous and quantitative analysis . assuming that we have to search for five parameters in all and that each parameter requires as many templates as the number of cycles we get a rough count of @xmath37 templates .",
    "we shall see below that this is a rather large over estimate .",
    "the number of independent parameters is possibly about three leading to a significant reduction in the number of templates .",
    "any measurement process is disturbed by a background perturbation or noise which causes a systematic and/or random errors in the measured quantities . in general , the errors get smaller at greater signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we review the theory behind estimating errors involved in a measurement process .    for a signal buried in a gaussian background and",
    "detected using matched filtering the covariance matrix @xmath38  a symmetric matrix whose diagonal elements are the variances in the measurement of the various parameters and the off - diagonal elements are the covariances between them . the covariance matrix is itself the inverse of the information matrix , or the metric , @xmath39 let us suppose the signal @xmath40 depends on @xmath41 parameters @xmath42 @xmath43 the information matrix is defined by @xmath44_{mn},\\ ] ] where for any two functions @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( and fourier transforms @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) their scalar product @xmath49 is defined as : @xmath50,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 is the ( real ) one - sided noise spectral density of the antenna and @xmath52 and @xmath53 are some appropriately defined lower and upper frequency cutoffs depending on the signal and/or the antenna response .",
    "starting from the covariance matrix one defines the matrix of correlation coefficients @xmath54 in the following manner : @xmath55 as is obvious the diagonal element @xmath56 of the matrix of correlation coefficients is the ( one - sigma ) standard deviation in the measurement of the parameter @xmath42 and the @xmath57-off - diagonal element @xmath54 is the normalized covariance between the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 the correlation coefficients @xmath54 take values in the range @xmath60.$ ] a correlation coefficient @xmath54 close to 1 ( or @xmath61 ) indicates that the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath62 are perfectly correlated ( or anti - correlated ) with each other .",
    "if on the other hand the value is close to zero then there is little correlation between the two parameters .",
    "when two parameters have a correlation coefficient close to @xmath63 then varying one of the parameters is equivalent to varying the other .",
    "in other words one does nt produce two independent signal shapes by varying both the parameters , varying only one of them should be sufficient . however , when two parameters are not correlated then varying one of them produces a distinct shape as compared to varying the other .",
    "therefore , we can look at the matrix of correlation coefficients to determine how many parameters are really independent",
    ".    finally , we can diagonalize the covariance matrix to find the _ principal components . _ on diagonalization one has ( linearly ) transformed from the parameter set @xmath58 to a new set @xmath64 effectively removing in the process all the covariances between the parameters .",
    "the principal components of the signal are those transformed parameters that correspond to the largest diagonal elements .",
    "since we have ( by construction ) a symmetric matrix the eigenvalues are all real . moreover , since the covariance matrix is the inverse of the metric the principal components are the inverses of the eigenvalues of the metric . before we embark upon a discussion of the results let us look at two simple examples .",
    "our first example is a simple mathematical example : consider a two - dimensional matrix @xmath65 suppose @xmath66 and @xmath67 the eigenvalues @xmath68 of such a matrix are @xmath69 if @xmath70 is close to zero then both the eigenvalues are roughly the same and both the parameters are equally important . if , however , @xmath71 is close to 1 then one of the eigenvalues is nearly _",
    "zero _ making the corresponding transformed parameter unimportant .",
    "thus , closer the correlation coefficient is to @xmath72 smaller is the significance of the parameter .    as a second example",
    "let us consider a sinusoidal signal @xmath73.$ ] here the parameters @xmath74 and @xmath75 are uncorrelated and so are @xmath74 and @xmath76 while @xmath75 and @xmath77 are perfectly anti - correlated .",
    "increasing @xmath77 is equivalent to decreasing @xmath75 but the signal has really only two independent parameters leading to two principal components .",
    "we now apply the formalism developed in the previous section to the gravitational wave signals produced by stellar mass black holes falling into supermassive black holes .",
    "we first compute the covariance matrix and then diagonalize it to obtain the principal components .",
    "let us first examine the matrix of correlation coefficients . in tables 1 - 3",
    "we have displayed the correlation coefficients of the smirches for three different values of the mass ratio , @xmath78 we have also changed the orientations of the spin , orbital angular momentum and source direction from one example to the other to get an idea of how the correlation coefficients depend on the angular parameters .",
    "tables 1 - 3 correspond to cases a , b and c , respectively ; in all cases the total mass @xmath79 @xmath80 and the initial orientation of the orbit is the same @xmath81    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "gravitational waves emitted by stellar mass black holes falling into a supermassive black hole encode a lot of information about the structure of the spacetime geometry around the massive kerr black hole . decoding this information",
    "requires not only accurate modelling of the emitted waveform but algorithms that can efficiently dig out and discriminate these signals .",
    "since the parameter space corresponding to such systems is quite large it has been thought that matched filtering , which is not only effective in detecting signals but also deciphering their information content , would be too expensive in a search for these signals . in this paper",
    "we have explored the signal manifold corresponding to spin modulated chirps , or _",
    "smirches _ as we would like to call them , using the covariance matrix and the method of principal components .",
    "we conclude that the problem might be tractable after all since the effective dimensionality of the parameter space might be a lot smaller than what has been thought before .",
    "the signal emitted by a small black hole in quasi - circular orbit around a massive kerr black hole is , in general , characterized by nine search parameters  the two masses , the magnitude of the black hole s spin and its orientation , initial orientation of the orbit and the direction to the source .",
    "our analysis has shown strong correlations between the two masses and the spin magnitude as well as between the different angular parameters .",
    "we have found strong indications that matched filtering a short duration smirch ( 1,000 to 100,000 cycles ) might require a search in only only 3- , or at most 4-dimensional parameter space .",
    "this means that one might be able to use matched filtering to fit the strongest smirches in lisa s data and dig deeper for weaker signals . before we can be completely optimistic about the result",
    ", a monte - carlo simulation should be performed to see if the overlap of arbitrary smirches can be larger than a certain minimal match ( say 50% ) when maximized over just three parameters .",
