    "the nucleus is a dynamic finite size system consisting of protons and neutrons , where their velocities can reach a significant fraction of the speed of light .",
    "the description of nuclear dynamics at such velocities is predominantly based on the concept of independent nucleons moving in a mean field potential .",
    "however , in spite of their independent random motions , the nucleons also have a propensity to congregate i.e. these nucleons possess correlations @xcite .",
    "the fact that the clustering of nucleons leads to the occurrence of molecular states in the atomic nuclei was already realized in the earliest days of nuclear physics study @xcite .",
    "the nuclear cluster phase is considered as the transitional state between the crystalline and quantum liquid phases of a fermionic system , which is linked to the studies of the ` nuclear pasta phase ' in the crust of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the nuclear structure data in the s - d shell region provide a wonderful opportunity to study the clustering phenomena since the densities of the deformed one - body states often exemplify significant cluster structure in this region @xcite .",
    "kimura and horiuchi showed @xcite that the super deformed ( sd ) band members of @xmath1s have a considerable amount of the @xmath10o + @xmath10o cluster component .",
    "the reaction calculations , using a deep @xmath10o + @xmath10o potential appropriate to the entrance channel , suggested the existence of @xmath10o + @xmath10o cluster bands in @xmath1s @xcite .",
    "similar sd band was obtained using the alpha - alpha double folding potential @xcite .",
    "recently , evidence of such cluster formations was also predicted by the macroscopic - microscopic potential energy surface calculations for @xmath1s @xcite .",
    "ichikawa et al , emphasized the inclusion of the rotational energy contribution and showed that the nuclear densities in the sd band become cluster - like at high angular momentum ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "experimentally , the inelastic scattering and the damped fragment yields , in the reaction @xmath6ne + @xmath7c , indicated the survival of an orbiting dinuclear system @xcite .",
    "it is now well known that these cluster structures are associated with strongly deformed shapes of nuclei .",
    "the deformations , estimated from the respective @xmath11-particle evaporation spectra in the reaction @xmath6ne + @xmath7c , have been found to be much larger compared to normal deformation attained by hot rotating composites at similar excitation energies @xcite . however , there has been no direct measurement of this deformation at high excitation energies and angular momenta .",
    "one of the probes to study this deformation experimentally at high excitation energies and angular momenta is the @xmath0-decay from the giant dipole resonance ( gdr ) built on excited states .",
    "it is the prime example of collective nuclear vibration , which can be understood macroscopically as the out of phase oscillation between the protons and neutrons , and microscopically in terms of coherent particle - hole excitations @xcite .",
    "the gdr emission occurs early in the decay of excited nuclei and also couples directly with the nuclear shape degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore , it is highly important to investigate experimentally the shapes of @xmath1s at different angular momenta to study how cluster formations are manifested in the gdr strength function .",
    "the gdr lineshape should reveal direct information about the geometrical configurations of the nuclei , which can provide vital clues about the underlying mechanism to understand the nuclear structure and collective dynamics at extreme conditions of @xmath12 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that , in the long - wavelength limit , the e1 decay of the gdr @xmath0-rays ( isovector in nature ) from self - conjugate nuclei is hindered since decays from same isospin ( @xmath13 ) states are forbidden @xcite . the yield , however , increases in the presence of isospin mixing due to the weak coulomb interaction characterized by isospin violating spreading width @xmath14 @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we report on the measurement of gdr strength function for @xmath1s at low and high @xmath2 in the reactions @xmath3he + @xmath5si and @xmath6ne+ @xmath7c , respectively and compare them to those obtained from the thermal shape fluctuation model .",
    "the coulomb spreading width has also been estimated by populating nearby nucleus @xmath15p in the reaction @xmath3he + @xmath16al .",
    "we show that the gdr lineshape at low @xmath2 indicates normal deformation , whereas at higher j point towards large deformation due cluster formation .",
    "( color online ) the experimental @xmath0-spectra ( symbols ) for @xmath15p ( a ) and @xmath1s ( b ) are shown for 46 mev excitation energy along with the statistical model calculation cascade plus bremsstrahlung .",
    "the corresponding linearized gdr strength functions are shown in panels ( c ) and ( d).,width=8,height=9 ]",
    "the experiments were performed using the k-130 cyclotron at the variable energy cyclotron centre ( vecc ) , kolkata .",
    "the excited @xmath1s nucleus was populated at lower @xmath2 in the reaction @xmath3he(e@xmath4=45mev ) + @xmath5si .",
    "the initial excitation energy was 46.3 mev while the critical angular momentum for fusion was 10@xmath9 . to extract the coulomb spreading width , the @xmath15p nucleus was also populated at the same excitation energy in the reaction @xmath3he(e@xmath4=42mev ) + @xmath16al but with @xmath13 = 1/2 entrance channel .",
    "the high energy gdr @xmath0-rays were detected using a part of the lambda spectrometer @xcite arranged in a 7@xmath177 matrix .",
    "the spectrometer was kept at a distance of 50 cm from the target position at an angle of 90@xmath18 to the beam direction .",
    "the gdr spectra were also measured at 55@xmath18 and 125@xmath18 to extract the bremsstrahlung slope parameter .",
    "low energy @xmath0-ray multiplicities were measured using the gamma multiplicity filter @xcite .",
    "the 50-element filter was split into two blocks of 25 detectors each and was placed above and below the scattering chamber at a distance of 5 cm from the target center .",
    "the high energy @xmath0-rays were separated from the neutron induced events employing the time of flight technique while the pile - up events were rejected using a pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique by measuring the charge deposition over two integrating time intervals ( 50 ns and 2 @xmath19s ) in each of the detectors .",
    "finally , the high - energy spectra for higher folds of the multiplicity filter were generated in offline analysis following the cluster summing technique @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1s nucleus was populated at higher @xmath2 in the reaction @xmath6ne(e@xmath4=145mev ) + @xmath7c .",
    "the initial excitation energy was 73 mev while the critical angular momentum for fusion was 21@xmath9 .",
    "the complete detector setup and experimental details can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "the statistical model calculation was performed using a modified version of cascade in which isospin quantum number had been taken into account .",
    "the @xmath14 and the gdr parameters at low @xmath2 for @xmath1s and @xmath15p were extracted using @xmath20 method in the range of 12 - 24 mev , following a recursive procedure described in detail in refs @xcite .",
    "the bremsstrahlung slope parameter was estimated by simultaneous fitting of the high energy @xmath0-ray spectra and a@xmath21(e@xmath22 ) coefficient , considering isotropic emission in a source frame moving with 0.6@xmath23 @xcite .",
    "the extracted slope parameter was consistent with the bremstrahlung systematics @xcite .",
    "the set of best fit gdr parameters was found to be e@xmath24 = 18.5 @xmath25 0.2 mev , @xmath26=9.5 @xmath25 0.5 mev and s@xmath24 = 1.1 @xmath25 0.03 .",
    "the extracted coulomb spreading width for @xmath1s was @xmath14=18 @xmath25 12 kev and found to be consistent with the measurements carried out by other groups @xcite .",
    "the high energy spectra for @xmath1s and @xmath15p , along with the statistical model calculations plus bremsstrahlung , are shown in fig [ fig1 ] . to emphasize the gdr region ,",
    "the linearized gdr plots are also shown in the figure using the quantity f(e@xmath22)y@xmath27(e@xmath22)/y@xmath28(e@xmath22 ) , where y@xmath27(e@xmath22 ) and y@xmath28(e@xmath22 ) are the experimental and the best fit cascade spectra , respectively , corresponding to lorentzian function f(e@xmath22 ) .",
    "the statistical calculations for @xmath1s with zero mixing ( @xmath14=0 kev ) and large mixing ( @xmath14=100 kev ) are also compared in fig [ fig1 ] .",
    "the average deformation was extracted from the gdr width using the emperical relation @xcite and ground state width as 7.5 mev @xcite .",
    "the estimated deformation at low j ( @xmath8 10@xmath9 ) is @xmath29 = 0.36 , slightly higher than the ground state value ( @xmath29 = 0.31 ) .",
    "it needs to be mentioned here that the data at higher angular momentum were analyzed earlier @xcite . in this work",
    ", we reanalzsed it using the isospin included cascade code .",
    "it has been seen experimentally and justified theoretically that @xmath14 remains constant with excitation energy @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that the gdr width increases with excitation energy due to thermal fluctuations and angular momentum induced deformation but the e@xmath24 remains constant @xcite .",
    "hence , the @xmath1s data , at higher j , in the reaction @xmath6ne + @xmath7c were tried to fit by varying only the gdr width .",
    "since the a@xmath21 coefficient was not measured earlier for this reaction , the bremsstrahlung slope was estimated from the bremsstrahlung systematic @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that the data can not be explained using a single lorentzian in the statistical model calculation ( fig [ fig2]a ) .",
    "a second component in the higher energy region is evident ( @xmath825 mev ) even in the high - energy @xmath0-ray spectrum .",
    "therefore , the data were analysed considering two lorentzian functions for the gdr in the cascade . although one could fit the lower energy component with small isospin mixing , it was not possible to fit the higher energy component with @xmath14=18 kev . even for @xmath14=100 kev ( which corresponds to large mixing ) , a strength function of 150 @xmath30 of trk sum rule also could not fit the higher energy component ( fig [ fig2]b ) . as a result",
    ", the data were analysed considering full mixing to extract the gdr components and is shown in fig [ fig2]c .",
    "the extracted gdr parameters are e@xmath31 = 14.7 @xmath25 0.3 mev , @xmath32 = 6.0 @xmath25 0.8 mev , s@xmath31 = 0.33 @xmath25 0.05 , e@xmath33= 25.6 @xmath25 0.8 mev , @xmath34=7.3 @xmath25 1.3 mev , s@xmath33=0.77 @xmath25 0.09 .",
    "the linearised gdr spectrum for e@xmath4 = 145 mev is shown in fig [ fig4]b using the quantity f(e@xmath22)y@xmath27(e@xmath22)/y@xmath28(e@xmath22 ) .",
    "the estimated deformation from the two gdr peaks is @xmath29 = 0.68 which corresponds to an axis ratio of 1:1.9 . in principle",
    ", the isospin mixing should be small for fusion - evaporation reaction .",
    "this is corroborated by the fact that small mixing ( @xmath14 = 18 kev ) can predict the experimentally obtained lower energy component ( 14.7 mev ) of the gdr spectra . in prolate",
    "deformed @xmath1s nucleus , the observation of the low energy gdr component suggests that one should also have another broader component in the higher energy region ( 22 - 25 mev ) and isospin mixing should also be small for it .",
    "however , it can not be explained with small mixing which indicates that , apart from the @xmath1s nucleus , the high energy component also has a contribution from much lighter mass nuclei . it may be noted that the extracted centroid and width of the second component are very similar to the @xmath10o ground state values @xcite .",
    "thus , the inability to explain the higher energy gdr component with standard parameters point towards the formation of cluster - like structures in a deformed @xmath1s nucleus .",
    "( color online ) the statistcal model calculation plus bremsstrahlung ( solid lines ) are compared to experimental data ( symbols ) at 145 mev incident energy using ( a ) small mixing ( b ) full mixing and ( c ) including the pre - equlibrium effect .",
    "the individual cascade ( dashed line ) and bremsstrahlung ( dashed - dotted line ) are also shown.,width=8,height=7 ]",
    "one can conjecture that the origin of the high energy component ( @xmath8 25 mev ) is due to the emission of high - energy @xmath0-rays from much lighter compound nuclei formed by incomplete fusion .",
    "however , in our earlier work on evaporation - residue - gated jacobi shape transition @xcite , it was observed that the non - fusion events were accompanied by @xmath0-rays in the range of 5 - 10 mev and were associated with low angular momentum events only .",
    "since our measurement was biased towards the higher multiplicity events , it can be inferred that the @xmath0-rays are emitted from a fully energy equilibrated composite .",
    "our earlier charge particle experiments @xcite , for the same reaction , clearly revealed that the damped fragments ( z=3 - 7 ) are emitted from a fully energy equilibrated composites and follow a 1/sin@xmath35 angular dependence .",
    "therefore , the contribution to the high energy component from incomplete fusion and deep - inelastic process can be completely ruled out .",
    "the charge particle studies also revealed that this reaction proceeds via the long - lived di - nuclear orbiting mechanism at high angular momenta .",
    "for an orbiting mechanism , the system becomes trapped in a more deformed configuration than that of the compound nucleus and is inhibited from spreading into the compound nucleus states @xcite .",
    "as it appears , the large yield of the higher gdr component is arises due to the nuclear orbiting process which leads to the cluster formation at higher @xmath2 .    in general , the light nuclei are expected to undergo jacobi shape transition , an abrupt change of shape from a non - collective oblate to a collectively rotating prolate or triaxial shape , at high angular momentum ( j @xmath8 17@xmath9 for @xmath1s ) .",
    "experimentally , it is observed as a sharp low energy component ( @xmath8 10 mev ) in the gdr spectrum @xcite .",
    "this peak arises due to the coriolis splitting of the gdr frequency corresponding to the largest axis of a collectively rotating prolate when the frequencies are transformed from internal rotating coordinate frame to the laboratory frame @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the jacobi shape transition is also characterized by large deformation ( @xmath29 @xmath8 0.7 ) .",
    "however , no low energy component is observed at higher @xmath2 indicating that the jacobi transition is not proceeding in this reaction .",
    "the possible reason can be due to the formation of the @xmath10o + @xmath10o cluster in @xmath1s at high @xmath2 @xcite via the nuclear orbiting mechanism due to the entrance channel .",
    "for such systems , the moment of inertia can be considered of a two - body freely rotating about an axis perpendicular to the symmetry axis rather than being a one - body rigid rotor .",
    "the moment of inertia of these molecular states has been found to be @xmath8 1.5 times larger compared to the super deformed states @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the angular frequency in this case would be much smaller reducing the effect of coriolis splitting for a given @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , considering the moment of inertia as a two - body freely rotating one , the calculated coulomb barrier heights can explain the existing experimental data of molecular resonance states in the @xmath10o + @xmath10o reaction channel @xcite .",
    "( color online ) the free energy surfaces for @xmath1s at @xmath12 = 2.0 mev and different angular momenta .",

    "the normal ( low @xmath2 ) , jacobi transition and cluster formation shapes are also shown on the right side.,width=8,height=7 ]    finally , the theoretical gdr lineshapes for the @xmath1s nucleus were also generated based on the thermal shape fluctuation model ( tsfm ) at both low and high angular momenta @xcite .",
    "the average temperature of the nucleus associated with the gdr decay was estimated from @xmath36=[(@xmath37 - @xmath38 - e@xmath24)/@xmath39@xmath40 using the cascade code .",
    "@xmath37 is the average of the excitation energy weighed over the daughter nuclei for the @xmath0 emission in the gdr region and @xmath38 is the average rotational energy .",
    "the level density parameter was taken as a/8 .",
    "the temperature corresponding to 45 mev incident energy was 2.0 @xmath25 0.2 mev while for 145 mev incident energy it was 2.3 @xmath25 0.4 mev .",
    "the free energy surfaces for the tsfm calculation were estimated using the relation f(t , j;@xmath29,@xmath0 ) = f(t , j=0;@xmath29,@xmath0 ) + @xmath41 where @xmath42 = @xmath43 is the moment of inertia about the rotation axis @xmath44 .",
    "f(t , j=0;@xmath29,@xmath0 ) is the non - rotating part and i@xmath45 , i@xmath46 , i@xmath47 are the principal rigid body moments of inertia . it was observed that , at these temperatures , the shell corrections ( included in the calculation ) were small , and f was predominantly given by the properties of a rotating liquid drop @xcite .",
    "the free energy surfaces at t = 2 mev for different @xmath2 are shown in fig [ fig3 ] .",
    "the tsfm calculations at corresponding @xmath2 and @xmath12 are compared with the experimental data in fig [ fig4 ] . as can be seen ,",
    "the tsfm calculation predicted a slightly larger width , as expected @xcite , but represented the overall nature of the experimental lineshape at low @xmath2 .",
    "on the other hand , the data are in complete disagreement with the tsfm calculation at higher @xmath2 .",
    "the calculation shows a sharp 10 mev peak characteristics of the jacobi shape transition but no such component is observed in the experiment .",
    "the gdr lineshapes were also generated at different angular momenta but it failed completely to explain the experimental data .",
    "we should mention here that the tsfm calculation does not take into account the cluster formation ( higher order deformation ) in the equilibrated nuclei .",
    "however , a calculation was performed by switching off the coriolis splitting of the gdr components .",
    "interestingly , the theoretical lineshape quite well explains the low energy component highlighting that the coriolis effect is indeed small at high j , as expected for cluster formation .",
    "but the calculation fails to represent the high energy part of the spectrum as it does not take into account the gdr component due to clusterization which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "as it appears , the possible reason for not observing the jacobi transition at high @xmath2 primarily seems to be due to the formation of the @xmath10o + @xmath10o component in @xmath1s via the nuclear orbiting process due to the target - projectile combination as predicted by the authors of ref@xcite .",
    "the jacobi transition , cluster formation and normal deformation ( at low j ) shapes are shown in fig [ fig4 ] .",
    "very recently , the gdr decay from @xmath15p in the reaction @xmath48f + @xmath7c has been measured at high j where an enhanced yield at around 10 mev has been observed suggesting the onset of the jacobi transition in the nearby nucleus of @xmath1s @xcite .",
    "thus , all the experimental results , though indirect , clearly suggest that the @xmath1s nucleus is not undergoing normal fusion evaporation mechanism and point towards the formation of cluster structure at high j rather convincingly . in the future , it will be an intriguing study to measure the gdr @xmath0-decay from nearby self - conjugate nuclei @xmath5si and @xmath49ar , and search for the absence of the jacobi transition which will establish gdr as a probe to study clustering in atomic nuclei at high @xmath12 and @xmath2 . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", it will be an interesting study to generate the gdr lineshapes due to cluster structures at high excitation as was performed recently @xcite for @xmath7c and @xmath10o at respective alpha decay thresholds .",
    "in summary , the gdr @xmath0-rays from @xmath1s were experimentally measured both at low and high @xmath2 to study the manifestation of clusterization via the gdr spectra .",
    "another experiment was performed to extract the coulomb spreading width by populating @xmath15p at the same excitation energy to estimate the isospin mixing . at low @xmath2",
    ", the gdr lineshape suggests a normal deformation pointing towards the usual compound nucleus evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "the nucleus is not proceeding via the usual fusion evaporation process at high j. the gdr lineshape suggests superdeformation ( @xmath29 @xmath8 0.7 ) , completely different from the jacobi transition lineshape , which largely points toward cluster formation in super deformed states of @xmath1s .",

    "<S> however , it is found that the gdr lineshape is fragmented into two prominent peaks at high j ( @xmath8 20@xmath9 ) providing a direct measurement of the large deformation developed in the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the observed lineshape is also completely different from the ones seen for jacobi shape transition at high @xmath2 pointing towards the formation of cluster structure in super - deformed states of @xmath1s at such high spin . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the gdr can be regarded as a unique tool to study cluster formation at high excitation energies and angular momenta . </S>"
