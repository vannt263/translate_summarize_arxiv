    "overdetermined boundary value problems in partial differential equations have connections to various fields in mathematics ; they emerge in the study of isoperimetric inequalities , optimal design and ill - posed and free boundary problems , to name a few . in many such problems",
    "one s interest is focused on a specific feature : the shape of the domain considered ; mainly , its ( spherical ) symmetry , as in serrin s landmark paper @xcite and its many offsprings ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and the references therein ) .    with the present paper , we want to start a more detailed analysis of overdetermined problems in the plane , by exploiting the full power of the theory of analytic functions . as a case study",
    ", we shall analyse what appears to be the simplest situation : in a planar bounded domain @xmath0 with boundary @xmath1 of class @xmath2 , we shall consider the problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the _ interior _ normal direction to @xmath1 , @xmath5 is the dirac delta centered at a given point @xmath6 and @xmath7 is a positive given function of arclength , measured counterclockwise from a reference point on @xmath1 .    problem ( [ pb1])-([pb3 ] ) can be interpreted as a free - boundary problem : find a domain @xmath0 whose green s function @xmath8 with pole at @xmath9 has gradient with values on the boundary that fit those of the given function @xmath10 .",
    "this formulation serve as a basis to model , for example , the hele - shaw flow , as done in @xcite and @xcite .    by means of the riemann mapping theorem , the solution of ( [ pb1])-([pb2 ] )",
    "can be esplicitly written in terms of a conformal mapping @xmath11 from the unit disk @xmath12 to @xmath0 , which is uniquely determined if satisfies some suitable normalizing conditions .",
    "since it turns out that the normal derivative of @xmath8 on @xmath1 is proportional to the modulus of the inverse of @xmath13 then by ( [ pb3 ] ) and classical results on holomorphic functions , we can derive an explicit formula for @xmath11 in terms of @xmath10 ( see section  2 for details ) . with the help of such a formula",
    ", we obtain the following results :    * existence and uniqueness theorems for a domain @xmath0 satisfying ( [ pb1])-([pb3 ] ) ( theorems [ tom ] and [ esistenza ] ) ; * symmetry results relating the invariance of @xmath10 under certain groups of transformations to that of @xmath0 ( theorems [ rot ] and [ simasse ] ) ; of course , when @xmath10 in constant , we obtain that @xmath0 is a disk  a well - known result ( see @xcite , @xcite @xcite ) ; * a formula relating the interior normal derivative of the green s function to the curvature of @xmath14",
    "in what follows , @xmath12 will always be the open unit disk in @xmath15 centered at @xmath16 let us recall some basic facts of harmonic and complex analysis .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for more details .",
    "if @xmath17 is a simply connected domain bounded by a jordan curve and @xmath6 , then , by the riemann mapping theorem , @xmath0 is the image of an analytic function @xmath18 which induces a homeomorphism between the closures @xmath19 and @xmath20 , has non - zero derivative @xmath21 in @xmath12 and is such that @xmath22 moreover , if @xmath0 is of class @xmath23 @xmath24 that is its boundary @xmath1 is locally the graph of a function of class @xmath23 then , by kellogg s theorem , we can infer that @xmath25 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the following elementary lemma will be useful in the sequel .",
    "] let @xmath0 be a bounded simply connected domain in @xmath15 and @xmath18 be one - to - one and analytic with @xmath26 @xmath27 then there exists @xmath28 such that @xmath29 for every @xmath30 .",
    "the function @xmath31 is analytic , never zero in @xmath12 and has unitary modulus on @xmath32 ; hence it equals the number @xmath33 for some @xmath34    with these premises , given two distinct numbers @xmath9 and @xmath35 we consider    the set @xmath36 of all @xmath23 @xmath24 simply connected    bounded domains such that @xmath6 and @xmath37 .",
    "we can put @xmath38 in one - to - one correspondence with    the class @xmath39 of all one - to - one analytic mappings    @xmath25 such that @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "in fact , the arbitrary parameter @xmath42 in ( [ rappre ] ) can be determined by observing that @xmath43    we now construct our forward operator @xmath44 as the one that associates to each @xmath0 in @xmath38 the interior normal derivative @xmath45  as function of the arclength , measured counterclockwise on @xmath46 starting from @xmath47  of the solution of ( [ pb1])-([pb2 ] ) . with our identification of @xmath38 with @xmath39 in mind , for @xmath48 , @xmath49 is a function of arclength @xmath50 $ ] and it is defined by the following remarks .    first , notice that , by gauss - green s formula , if @xmath8 satisfies ( [ pb1])-([pb2 ] ) , then @xmath51 for every function @xmath52 which is harmonic in @xmath53    secondly , recall that any such function @xmath54 satisfies the well - known formula @xmath55 if @xmath1 is rectifiable ( see @xcite ) . by comparing the last two formulas ( with @xmath56 we obtain that @xmath57    thirdly , since the arclength on @xmath1 is related to @xmath11 by the formula @xmath58,\\ ] ]",

    "therefore , for any @xmath10 in the range of @xmath44 , a unique @xmath48 such that @xmath75 is determined by @xmath76 with @xmath21 given by ( [ rappre2 ] ) .",
    "we collect these remarks in the following theorem .",
    "[ tom ] given @xmath77 , let @xmath47 be a reference point on @xmath1 from which the arclength on @xmath1 is measured counterclockwise .",
    "if @xmath10 is the interior normal derivative of the green s function on @xmath1 ( as function of the arclength ) , then a unique @xmath48 is determined such that @xmath75 and its derivative is given by @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are defined by ( [ teta ] ) and ( [ teta2 ] ) , respectively .",
    "moreover , the constant @xmath42 is determined by @xmath81    theorem [ tom ] tells us that the operator @xmath64 is injective .",
    "a discussion about its surjectivity is beyond the aims of this paper .",
    "far from being complete , we want here to suggest the following criterion .    referring to @xcite ,",
    "let us introduce the so called _ boundary rotation _ of a function @xmath11 defined in @xmath12 : @xmath82 we consider the class @xmath83 of all normalized functions @xmath84 which are analytic , locally univalent and with @xmath85 .",
    "the proof of the surjectivity of @xmath64 relies on the problem of finding an analytic and univalent function @xmath11 from the disk to @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , we have to look for sufficient conditions for univalence .",
    "the following theorem is based on a sufficient condition , due to paatero , that says that any function in the class @xmath83 with @xmath87 is univalent ( see @xcite ) .",

    "[ tom ] , we know that a function @xmath48 such that @xmath92 must satisfy ( [ nicola ] ) . thus , we have to check paatero s condition on ( [ nicola ] ) . from that expression we deduce that @xmath93 being @xmath79 defined as in ( [ teta ] ) and ( [ teta2 ] ) .",
    "now , by observing that @xmath94 we can integrate by parts and obtain that @xmath95 by the maximum modulus principle , we can estimate , for @xmath96 @xmath97}\\left|\\frac{\\varphi'(s(t))s'(t)}{\\varphi(s(t))}\\right| ,                              \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and , from ( [ fi ] ) , we have that @xmath98 therefore , we can estimate the boundary rotation of @xmath11 in the following way : @xmath99 } \\left|\\frac{\\varphi'(s(t))}{2\\pi\\varphi^2(s(t))}\\right|\\right)d\\theta= 2\\pi\\left(1+\\max_{[0,l ] } \\left|\\frac{\\varphi'(s)}{2\\pi\\varphi^2(s)}\\right|\\right).\\ ] ] by our assumptions , it follows that @xmath87 and hence , from paatero s criterion for univalence , @xmath11 is a homeomorphism from the disk onto @xmath100",
    "theorem [ tom ] allows us to rediscover a result already proved in @xcite and also in @xcite and @xcite : if @xmath10 is constant , then @xmath0 is a disk .",
    "more precisely , given @xmath77 with perimeter @xmath89 , let @xmath10 be constantly equal to @xmath101 from ( [ nicola ] ) , we obtain that @xmath102 since @xmath103 . therefore , we get that @xmath104 that is @xmath0 is the disk centered at @xmath9 with radius @xmath105    now we want to show how some other symmetry properties of @xmath0 can be derived from some invariance properties of @xmath10 and viceversa . in what follows , for @xmath106 let @xmath107 and let @xmath10 denote the values of the interior normal derivative on @xmath1 ( as function of arclength ) of the green s function of @xmath53    in the next theorem , we will identify @xmath10 with its @xmath89-periodic extension to @xmath108 and @xmath109 will denote the clockwise rotation of an angle @xmath110 around a point @xmath111    [ rot ] given @xmath106 for every @xmath112    @xmath113 if and only if @xmath10 is @xmath114-periodic .",
