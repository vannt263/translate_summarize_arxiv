    "\\(iii ) although the range of energy of cmes ( kinetic + potential @xmath229 ergs on average , hundhausen 1994b ) is the same as for big flares , their momentum can be one hundred times larger than the momentum carried by downflowing electrons produced by flares ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "this is favourable to a higher efficiency of the energy transfer to acoustic modes .",
    "we have investigated the consequences of interpreting the observed correlations in terms of an hypothetical excitation mechanism , in addition to the well established excitation by the granules . in particular",
    ", this interpretation requires impulsive events occurring no more than a few times per day in the iphir period .",
    "this has drawn our attention to the largest x - ray flares and cmes at solar maximum .",
    "the variation of their typical energy and occurrence rate with the solar cycle could account for the variation of the correlation between the iphir and golf observations .",
    "+ if due to solar flares , the correlation determined from iphir data requires that at least @xmath230 of the energy of each x - ray flares is injected into each low degree mode at solar maximum .",
    "given the number of modes ( at least @xmath231 due to the small scale of flares ) which should receive the same energy as low degree modes , we are inclined to exclude x - ray flares regardless of the efficiency of the acoustic wave emission by each event .",
    "this reasoning , however , does not exclude the possibility of more energetic processes associated to flares , such as the restructuring of the magnetic field in the flare region mentioned by wolf ( 1972 ) and kosovichev & zharkova ( 1995 ) .",

    "higher degree modes ( @xmath233 ) would not be correlated in this case .",
    "\\(ii ) cmes could correlate more modes if significantly more than the observed mechanical energy of cmes can be extracted from their energy reservoir and injected into acoustic modes .",
    "+ if all cmes participate to acoustic emission with an efficiency @xmath178 independent of their energy , they should be responsible for a fraction @xmath234 of low degree p mode total power at solar maximum .",
    "nevertheless , this fraction might be significantly smaller if only a subset of high energy cmes participates to acoustic emission .",
    "the contribution of cmes to the low degree p mode power has to be reconciled with the observed @xmath146 decrease of their power at solar maximum .",
    "a better theoretical understanding of the efficiency of the energy transfer from a cme event to acoustic modes is needed .",
    "+ if our interpretation of iphir correlations is correct , we should be able to make the following observational tests :    - detect the effect of the largest cmes on the energy of low degree p modes , even at solar minimum ,    - measure the correlation @xmath235 at solar minimum , using longer time series and more modes than f98 ,    - confirm with soho , during the next solar maximum , the correlations determined from iphir data , measure them with a better accuracy , and determine whether higher degree modes are also correlated .",
