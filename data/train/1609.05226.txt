    "it is well - known that magnetic turbulence influences the motion of electrically charged energetic particles such as cosmic rays .",
    "turbulence in general has different properties such as the spectrum describing how the magnetic energy is distributed among different length scales .",
    "another fundamental aspect of turbulence is spectral anisotropy describing how magnetic turbulence varies in different directions of space .",
    "diffusion of particles along the mean magnetic field , for instance , is controlled by gyro - resonant interactions ( see , e.g. , schlickeiser 2002 and shalchi 2009 for reviews ) . therefore , the spectrum of turbulence at a certain scale or wavenumber determines the diffusion coefficient of the energetic particles with a certain energy .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that nonlinear effects can be important for parallel diffusion and non - resonant interactions can influence the diffusion parameter in certain parameter regimes ( see shalchi 2009 for a review ) .",
    "spectral anisotropy can also have an effect but this effect is weaker than originally thought ( see hussein et al .",
    "2015 ) . for perpendicular diffusion",
    ", however , the details of the turbulence seem to be less important because the perpendicular diffusion coefficient depends only on the so - called kubo number and the parallel diffusion coefficient ( see shalchi 2015 ) . due to the latter dependence , however , the perpendicular diffusion parameter indirectly also depends on spectrum and spectral anisotropy .",
    "another important turbulence property is the dynamics describing the characteristic time scales over which the turbulent magnetic field decorrelates .",
    "different approaches have been proposed in the past to model the turbulence dynamics .",
    "some attempts are based on plasma wave propagation models in which the propagation effect itself is taken into account as well as various damping effects ( see again schlickeiser 2002 for a review ) . or there is the important work of bieber et al .",
    "( 1994 ) in which simple models have been proposed to approximate the temporal decorrelation of turbulence , namely the so - called _ damping model of dynamical turbulence _ and the _ random sweeping model_. in the recent years scientists achieved a more complete understanding of the turbulence time scales . therefore a more advanced model for the turbulence dynamics has been proposed in shalchi et al .",
    "this model is called the _ nonlinear anisotropic dynamical turbulence ( nadt ) model _ and takes into account wave propagation effects as well as damping effects .",
    "it is the aim of this article to simulate energetic particle motion in this type of turbulence and to explore the influence of different turbulence parameters .",
    "it was shown in different papers that dynamical turbulence effects can have a strong influence on the transport of energetic particles .",
    "this concerns parallel diffusion ( see , e.g. , bieber et al . 1994 ) but also perpendicular diffusion ( see , e.g. , shalchi et al .",
    "such previous investigations were based on quasilinear and nonlinear calculations .",
    "these days , however , one can also obtain diffusion parameters from test - particle simulations .",
    "previous work of this type was mostly done for magnetostatic turbulence ( see , e.g. , giacalone & jokipii 1999 , qin et al . 2002a , and qin et al .",
    "2002b ) or undamped propagating plasma waves ( see , e.g. , michaek & ostrowski 1996 and tautz & shalchi 2013 ) . in hussein & shalchi ( 2016 ) we have started to simulate test - particle transport in the dynamical turbulence models used in bieber et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , namely in the _ damping model of dynamical turbulence _ and the _ random sweeping model_. it was shown in hussein & shalchi ( 2016 ) that for certain turbulence parameters we can indeed reproduce different solar wind observations .",
    "it is the purpose of the current paper to simulate particle transport in the more realistic nadt model and to compute the parallel mean free path @xmath1 , the perpendicular mean free path @xmath2 , and the ratio of the two mean free paths @xmath3 . as in hussein & shalchi ( 2016 ) our findings",
    "are compared with the palmer ( 1982 ) consensus range , observations of jovian electrons ( see chenette et al",
    ". 1977 ) , and ulysses measurements of galactic protons ( see burger et al . 2000 ) .",
    "we also explore how the different turbulence parameters influence the different diffusion parameters .",
    "the reminder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we explain the physics of turbulence in general but we focus on the nadt model used in the current paper .",
    "the methodology which is used to perform particle transport simulations in dynamical turbulence is explained in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we show our numerical results obtained for parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients and we compare them with different solar wind observations . in section 5",
    "we conclude and summarize .",
    "in the analytical description of turbulence , the fundamental quantity is the magnetic correlation tensor in the wave vector space .",
    "the components of the latter tensor are defined via p_mn ( , t ) = where we have used the ensemble average operator @xmath4 .",
    "a standard assumption in the theory of dynamical turbulence is that all tensor components obey the same temporal behavior and , therefore , they can be written as p_mn ( , t ) = p_mn ( ) ( , t ) .",
    "[ tensorwithgamma ] here we have used the magnetostatic tensor components @xmath5 and the _ dynamical correlation function _ @xmath6 . in the current paper we employ the nadt model in order to approximate the function @xmath6 .",
    "before we discuss this model in detail , we focus on the static tensor components .      the slab/2d composite model is widely used in the transport theory of energetic particles ( see , e.g. , bieber et al . 1994 and bieber et al . 1996 ) .",
    "in the current paper we employ this model , which is also known as two - component model , as it was already done in hussein & shalchi ( 2016 ) .",
