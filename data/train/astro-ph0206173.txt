    "many modifications to the standard model of big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) have been explored @xcite .",
    "one of the most exhaustively investigated variations on the standard model is neutrino degeneracy , in which each type of neutrino is allowed to have a non - zero chemical potential @xcite , and a number of models have been proposed to produce a large lepton degeneracy @xcite-@xcite .",
    "more recently , observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) fluctuations have been combined with bbn to further constrain the neutrino chemical potentials @xcite-@xcite .",
    "an interesting variation on these models is the possibility that the neutrino degeneracy is inhomogeneous @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the consequences of inhomogeous neutrino degeneracy for bbn were examined by dolgov and pagel @xcite and whitmire and scherrer @xcite .",
    "dolgov and pagel examined models in which the length scale of the inhomogeneity was sufficiently large to produce an inhomogeneity in the presently - observed abundances of the elements produced in bbn .",
    "whitmire and scherrer investigated inhomogeneities in the neutrino degeneracy on smaller scales ; in these models the element abundances mix to produce a homogeneous final element distribution . using a linear programming technique , they derived upper and lower bounds on the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath0 for _ arbitrary _ distributions of the neutrino chemical potentials and showed that the upper bound on @xmath0 could be considerably relaxed .",
    "however , the resulting distributions for the neutrino chemical potentials were quite unnatural .",
    "hence , in this paper , we examine a more restricted class of models , in which the distribution of the chemical potentials is taken to be a gaussian .    in the next section",
    ", we discuss our model for inhomogeneous neutrino degeneracy .",
    "we calculate the effect of these inhomogeneities on the final element abundances and discuss our results in sec .",
    "we find that , in most cases , the effect of gaussian inhomogeneities in the electron neutrino chemical potential is to increase the abundances of deuterium , @xmath4he , and @xmath5li relative to their abundances in models with homogeneous neutrino degeneracy .",
    "we first consider the case of homogeneous neutrino degeneracy . for this case , each type of neutrino is characterized by a chemical potential @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , which redshifts as the temperature , so it is useful to define the constant quantity @xmath9 .",
    "then the neutrino and antineutrino number densities are functions of @xmath10 : @xmath11 and @xmath12 and the total energy density of the neutrinos and antineutrinos is @xmath13 electron neutrino degeneracy changes the @xmath14 weak rates through the number densities given in equations ( [ nnu1 ] ) and ( [ nnu2 ] ) , while the change in the expansion rate due to the altered energy density in equation ( [ rhonu ] ) affects bbn for degeneracy of any of the three types of neutrinos .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .    now consider the effect of inhomogeneities in the neutrino chemical potential .",
    "as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , neutrino free - streaming will erase any fluctuations on length scales smaller than the horizon at any given time .",
    "thus , in order for inhomogeneities to affect bbn , they must be non - negligible on scales larger than the horizon scale at @xmath14 freeze - out , which corresponds to a comoving scale @xmath15 pc today .",
    "on the other hand , if the neutrino chemical potential is inhomogeneous on scales larger than the element diffusion scale , estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite to correspond to a comoving length @xmath16 mpc , then the result will be an inhomogeneous distribution of observed element abundances today ( the possibility considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    to make any further progress , we need a specific distribution @xmath17 for neutrino chemical potentials . in analogy with the distribution of primordial density perturbations ( and in accordance with the central limit theorem ) we take this distribution to be a multivariate gaussian .",
    "such a distribution is entirely characterized by the power spectrum of fluctuations , @xmath18 . for a power spectrum of the form",
    "@xmath19 the rms fluctuation @xmath3 on a given length scale @xmath20 is given by @xmath21 we wish to consider only cases for which the presently - observed element distribution ( determined by @xmath3 at a comoving scale of @xmath16 mpc ) is homogenous , while the distribution is highly inhomogenous on the horizon scale at nucleosynthesis ( a comoving scale of @xmath15 pc ) . since our two length scales of interest differ by a factor of @xmath22 , this condition can be satisfied for any @xmath23 power spectrum with @xmath24 .",
    "for instance , for a white - noise power spectrum , @xmath25 , a value of @xmath26 at the bbn horizon scale corresponds to @xmath27 at the element diffusion scale .    given these conditions , it is a good approximation to assume that bbn takes place in separate horizon volumes , with the value of @xmath6 taken to be homogeneous within each volume . at late times , the elements produced within each volume mix uniformly to produce the observed element abundances today .",
    "we make the additional assumption that the neutrino fluctuations are isocurvature , so that the total fluctuation in energy density is zero , even when the chemical potential is inhomogeneous .",
    "this implies that the overdensity in the degenerate neutrinos is compensated by an underdensity in some other component . in ref .",
    "@xcite , for example , the degeneracies in each of the three neutrinos are arranged so that the total density remains uniform . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the compensation is produced by a sterile neutrino .",
    "such models have the advantage that they produce no additional inhomogeneities in the cosmic microwave background as long as the compensating energy density does not include photons or baryons .",
    "( note that this is not the assumption made in ref .",
    "we also assume for simplicity that @xmath0 remains uniform in the presence of an inhomogeneous lepton distribution . with this set of assumptions ,",
    "the only neutrino for which inhomogeneities in the chemical potential are important for bbn is the electron neutrino ; the effect of the other neutrino chemical potentials is to alter the total energy density , which is now assumed to be homogeneous .",
    "it has recently been noted that if the large mixing angle solution of the solar neutrino problem is correct , then neutrino flavor oscillations will cause the neutrino chemical potentials to equilibrate prior to big bang nucleosynthesis @xcite . in our inhomogeneous model ,",
    "the effect of this equilibration would depend on the compensation mechanism for the inhomogeneities . in models",
    "in which the fluctuations in the electron neutrino chemical potential are compensated by fluctuations in the chemical potentials of the @xmath28 and @xmath29 neutrinos , the effect of such flavor oscillations would be to erase any spatial fluctuations in the chemical potentials . in models where the electron neutrino chemical potential fluctuations are compensated in some other way",
    ", the chemical potentials of all three species would be equal at any point in space , but the spatial fluctuations would be preserved .",
    "any large @xmath1 in this case would have to be due to some other form of energy beyond the standard three neutrinos .",
    "the model described in the previous section can be completely specified by two parameters , the ( inhomogeneous ) electron neutrino degeneracy parameter , @xmath30 , and the additional ( homogeneous ) energy density due to the degeneracy of all three neutrinos plus any additional relativistic component .",
    "we parametrize the latter in terms of @xmath1 , the effective number of additional neutrinos .",
    "this second parameter hides our ignorance about the compensation mechanism and about the degeneracies among the other two types of neutrinos . in our simulation , we take @xmath30 to be homogeneous within a given horizon volume during nucleosynthesis . different horizon volumes may have different values of @xmath30 , which are given by the distribution function @xmath31 , i.e , the probability that a given horizon volume has a value of @xmath30 between @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "( since we are considering only inhomogeneities in electron neutrinos , we now drop the @xmath33 subscript ) .",
    "we take @xmath34 to have a gaussian distribution with mean @xmath2 and rms fluctuation @xmath3 : @xmath35\\ ] ] then the final primordial element abundances , for a fixed value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , will be functions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 ; we can write , for a given nuclide @xmath36 , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass fraction of @xmath36 as a function of @xmath6 , and @xmath39 is the mass fraction of @xmath36 averaged over all space ; after the matter is thoroughly mixed , @xmath39 will be the final primordial mass fraction .    a full treatment for all possible values of @xmath0",
    ", @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 is impractical .",
    "we have chosen to concentrate on variations in the latter two quantities , since we are most interested in the effects of inhomogeneities in the chemical potential . because of the large number of free parameters and the difficulty of exhaustively searching all of parameter space , our goal is to discern any general results which are independent of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "there are now strong limits on @xmath0 from the cosmic microwave background alone , independent of bbn .",
    "we examine two extreme values for @xmath0 : @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; these represent very conservative lower and upper bounds on @xmath0 from the cmb in models with non - zero neutrino degeneracy @xcite . for @xmath1 , we consider @xmath42 and 5 .",
    "note that the first of these is only possible if the extra energy density in the degenerate electron neutrinos is compensated by a decrease in the energy density in some other relativistic component .",
    "for each of these cases , we calculate the abundances of @xmath4he , d , and @xmath5li as a function of @xmath3 for @xmath43 to @xmath44 in steps of 0.5 .",
    "our results are displayed in figures 1 - 3 . in each of these figures",
    ", we also show observational limits on the primordial element abundances from ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the general behavior of the element abundances in figs .",
    "1 - 3 is very clear .",
    "as expected , for @xmath48 , the abundances of deuterium , @xmath4he , and @xmath5li are unchanged from their values in the corresponding homogeneous model with the same value of @xmath2 . at the opposite limit , when @xmath49 , the models all converge to a single limiting value ; again , this is what one would naively expect .",
    "what is interesting is that , with a few exceptions , the introduction of a gaussian distribution of values for @xmath6 results in an _ increase _ in the abundance of each element relative to the corresponding homogeneous model with the same value of @xmath2 .",
    "the only exceptions occur for @xmath4he with negative values of @xmath2 , ( for which @xmath50 is far too large to be physically reasonable ) , and some of the @xmath5li curves , for which there is a tiny decrease in the @xmath5li abundance over a short range of @xmath3 values .",
    "this result may seem surprising , but it is a simple consequence of the behavior of @xmath38 . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath38 is a convex function ( @xmath51 ) , then jensen s inequality @xcite gives @xmath52 we find , for example , for @xmath42 , and both values of @xmath0 , that our @xmath53 curves are all convex in the range @xmath54 , with the exception of @xmath4he at @xmath55 , and @xmath5li with @xmath41 .",
    "these are precisely the regimes for which we observe equation ( [ jensen ] ) to fail .",
    "of course , none of the @xmath38 curves is convex for all values of @xmath6 ; the practical condition for equation ( [ jensen ] ) to hold is that the @xmath53 curves be convex as long as @xmath34 is non - negligible .",
    "this simple behavior allows us to draw some useful general conclusions . in models in which @xmath6 and @xmath1 are allowed to vary freely ,",
    "if we fix @xmath6 and trace out the allowed region in the @xmath0 , @xmath1 plane , then the upper and lower bounds on @xmath0 are set primarily by the upper observational bound on @xmath5li and the upper observational limit on d , respectively , with the @xmath4he limits serving primarily to set the bounds on @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "however , our results indicate that the general effect of going from a homogeneous to an inhomogeneous distribution in @xmath6 is to _ increase _ both the deuterium and the @xmath5li abundances .",
    "( again , we note a slight decrease in @xmath5li over a small range in @xmath3 , but this is a tiny effect ) .",
    "hence , the net effect of introducing this inhomogeneity will be to _ decrease _ the allowed range for @xmath0 , in comparison with the corresponding homogeneous model .",
    "this is a rare example in the study of bbn in which the introduction of an extra degree of freedom does nothing to increase the allowed range for @xmath0 . instead , the effect of adding a gaussian distribution of values for @xmath6 is to decrease the allowed range for @xmath0 .",
    "although we have assumed a gaussian distribution for @xmath6 , our results are much more general .",
    "in particular , as long as our distribution @xmath34 is negligible over the range of values of @xmath6 for which @xmath38 is not a convex function , we expect equation ( [ jensen ] ) to hold .",
    "this would apply , for example , to a top hat distribution with the same values of @xmath3 as those examined here .",
    "moreover , the distribution @xmath34 need not even be symmetric for our results to apply .",
    "our results contrast with those of ref .",
    "@xcite , which found an expanded upper limit on @xmath0 in models with inhomogeneous @xmath6 .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the models examined in ref .",
    "@xcite allowed for an arbitrary distribution in @xmath6 , and large increases in @xmath0 occurred for bizarre distributions in @xmath6 .",
    "in particular , the distributions in ref .",
    "@xcite sampled extreme values for @xmath6 , outside the range for which all of the @xmath38 functions are convex .",
