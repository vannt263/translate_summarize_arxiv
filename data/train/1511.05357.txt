    "authentication codes ( macs ) are cryptographic primitives used extensively in the construction of security services , including authentication , nonrepudiation , and integrity .",
    "basically , message authentication is to ensure that an accepted message truly comes from its acclaimed transmitter .",
    "when the transmitter intends to send a message , it also generates a mac , which is a function of the message and a shared key , known only to both the transmitter and the receiver . the generated mac is often appended to the message @xcite . at the receiver ,",
    "a mac is computed from the received message and compared to the mac that is transmitted . if the two macs are identical , then the transmitter is identified as a legal user and it is highly likely the received message is exactly equal to the one transmitted .    in the past , two main approaches , including information - theoretic authentication codes @xcite and complexity - theoretic macs , were almost independently developed for the purpose of authentication . in general , they differ in the assumptions about the capabilities of an opponent .",
    "information - theoretic authentication codes , which are based on information theory , offer unconditional security , i.e. , security independent of the computing power of an adversary .",
    "the complexity - theoretic approach starts from an abstract model for computation , and assumes that the opponent has limited computing power . due to their high flexibility",
    ", the complexity - theoretic macs find widespread applications in practice .",
    "complexity - theoretic mac algorithms can be constructed from other cryptographic primitives , such as cryptographic hash functions , or block cipher algorithms .",
    "currently , the security of mac algorithms rely on the hardness of hash functions , i.e , given the message and its mac , it is  hard \" to forge a mac on a new message .",
    "this means that they can be broken if the adversary has an unlimited power of computation .    in recent years",
    ", there has been various efforts @xcite in authenticating the transmitter and receiver at the physical layer , based on prior coordination or secret sharing , where the sender is authenticated if the receiver can successfully demodulate and decode the transmission . in @xcite ,",
    "a physical - layer authentication scheme was proposed , in which macs , along with messages , are transmitted concurrently over the physical layer . compared to the traditional transmission approach above the physical layer ,",
    "the authors claim the possibility of information - theoretic security due to the presence of channel noise .",
    "however , its security often depends on the physical channel .    in this paper",
    ", we develop a new cryptographic primitive , artificial - noise - aided macs ( ana - macs ) for ensuring information - theoretic security .",
    "the use of artificial noise in ana - macs makes it difficult for an opponent to derive the key . with the use of quantization",
    ", ana - macs can be encapsulated and transmitted in packets above the physical layer , just like the traditional macs , which is in sharp contrast to existing physical layer authentication schemes .",
    "it should be pointed out that the proposed ana - macs are also different with the binary approximate message authentication codes ( amacs ) @xcite and the noise - tolerant message authentication codes ( nt - macs ) @xcite .",
    "both amacs and nt - macs are designed to tolerate some channel errors during the transmission of messages . for ana - macs , a slight change in messages may result in a rapid change for authentication tags , as often encountered in the traditional macs .",
    "yet , ana - macs can tolerate some channel errors occurred during the transmission of tags .",
    "furthermore , both amacs and nt - macs are computationally secure , while ana - macs may ensure some degree of information - theoretic security .    throughout this paper",
    ", we do not discriminate the notations between scalars and vectors , which will be made clear from the contexts . for a binary vector @xmath0",
    ", its bipolar form is simply denoted as @xmath1 , in which each component takes value from @xmath2 . to be consistent with the standard convention in algorithms and complexity theory , where the running time of an algorithm is measured as a function of the length of its input @xmath3",
    ", we will thus provide the adversary and the honest parties with the security parameter in unary as @xmath4 ( i.e. , a string of @xmath3 1 s ) when necessary @xcite .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . some preliminaries on both information - theoretic authentication codes and macs are made in section - ii . in section - iii , a new cryptographic primitive , ana - macs , is proposed and its verification mechanism is given .",
    "then , its security analysis is formulated in section - iv . in section - v",
    ", we provide a pragmatic approach for analysis of ana - macs .",
    "section - vi presents numerical results and the conclusion is made in section - vii .",
    "a systematic authentication code is a triple of @xmath5 of finite sets and a mapping @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the source state space , @xmath8 is the tag space , @xmath9 is the key space , and @xmath10 is often called an encoding rule for a given @xmath11 .    two trusting parties , alice ( or a transmitter ) and bob ( or a receiver ) , share a secret key @xmath11 . to send a piece of information ( called source state ) @xmath12 to bob , alice computes @xmath13 and puts the message @xmath14 into a public channel . after receiving @xmath15 , bob will compute @xmath16 and check whether @xmath17 .",
    "if yes , bob will accept it as authentic . otherwise , bob will reject it .",
    "we assume that an opponent ( or eve ) has a complete understanding of the system , including the mapping @xmath18 .",
    "the only thing she does not know is the key @xmath19 agreed upon by alice and bob , which is used to specify a particular encoding rule @xmath20 . we also assume that eve has the ability to introduce a message into the channel . after observation of the first @xmath21 messages @xmath22 , eve places her own message @xmath23 into the channel , attempting to make bob accept it as authentic .",
    "this is called a spoofing attack of order @xmath21 . in literature , there are often two different types of spoofing attack , i.e. , impersonation attack and substitution attack . an impersonation attack at time @xmath24 @xcite is just the spoofing attack of order @xmath21 . in a so - called substitution attack at time @xmath21 ,",
    "eve observed @xmath21 messages @xmath22 and replaces the message @xmath25 by a different message which she hopes to be accepted by bob .    for systematic authentication codes , a source state @xmath26 is assumed to be public ( without security ) whenever @xmath14 is transmitted , which can be freely accessed by both bob and eve .",
    "for this reason , we simply use the authentication tag @xmath0 instead of a full message @xmath23 in what follows .",
    "let @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the random variables describing the key , the @xmath24-th tag and a sequence of @xmath21 tags from time 1 to @xmath21 , and taking values @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the expected probability of successful deception for a spoofing attack of order @xmath21 and @xmath32 the probability of successful deception if eve can observe at most @xmath21 messages .",
    "walker @xcite proved @xmath33 and rosenbaum @xcite proved @xmath34 which hold even if eve has an unlimited power of computation .",
    "if the equality in ( [ pflb ] ) holds , the corresponding authentication code is called @xmath21-perfect .    to prevent eve from using @xmath35 to learn the key @xmath19",
    ", it should have sufficient number of solutions of @xmath19 for a given @xmath35 @xcite . given @xmath26 and @xmath0 ,",
    "let @xmath36 denotes the set of solutions for @xmath35 .",
    "it follows that the successful deception probability for a given pair @xmath37 has a lower bound of @xmath38    in @xcite , projective plane codes were proposed to achieve the best possible spoofing attack of order @xmath39 , namely , @xmath40 . for the best authentication codes achieving the lower bound of @xmath41 , it was proved that    1 .",

    "for 1-perfect systematic authentication codes , they can not resist the spoofing attack of order @xmath48 , namely , @xmath49 .",
    "it is enough to consider @xmath50 .",
    "suppose that eve has accessed two different messages @xmath51 and @xmath52 , where @xmath43 . to insert a new message @xmath14 , where @xmath53 , eve wants to derive the key @xmath19 , which can be surely learned from two available messages since @xmath42 .",
    "indeed , there is a single common solution of @xmath19 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 if @xmath43 .",
    "given @xmath56 and @xmath30 , let @xmath57 denote the set of solutions for @xmath58 .",
    "clearly , @xmath59 .    for @xmath21-perfect authentication codes , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",

    "that a mac implies a two - round authentication protocol : the verifier chooses a random message as challenge , and the prover returns the mac on the message .",

    "information - theoretic ( systematic ) authentication codes provide message authenticity guarantees in an information theoretic sense within a symmetric key setting .",
    "however , information theoretic bounds on the spoofing attack of order @xmath21 show that they are still vulnerable ( theorems 1 and 2 ) if the opponent can access much more authenticated messages .",
    "complexity - theoretic macs can be seen as a _ counterpart _ of information - theoretic authentication codes _ in the field of computational security _ , without considering the information - theoretic deception probability .    in the past , information - theoretic authentication codes and complexity - theoretic macs are almost independently developed .",
    "it is interesting to ask if we can construct macs , which are both computationally secure and information - theoretically secure .",

    "the authentication tag is a deterministic function of a source message @xmath26 and the key @xmath19 shared between alice and bob .",
    "the only exception is the authentication codes with splitting , where the mapping @xmath72 is allowed to be stochastic in the sense that , for given @xmath19 and @xmath26 , @xmath82 is a stochastic variable .    noting that the use of a stochastic encoding mapping in authentication may be helpful for preventing possible spoofing attacks , since the conditional equivocation about the key may increase compared to a deterministic mapping . in order to make this ideal more practical , we propose to introduce artificial noise to corrupt the standard authentication tags .",
    "on one hand , the introduction of artificial noise may increase the conditional equivocation about the key , namely , @xmath83 . here",
