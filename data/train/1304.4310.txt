    "network theory has proven a powerful framework for studying the effects of randomness and heterogeneity on the dynamics of interacting agents with non - trivial connectivity patterns @xcite .",
    "one of the most important applications of this work is to the spread of infectious diseases among human populations , where the interaction structure is highly complex , showing salient features such as power - law degree distributions , small average path lengths , and modularity @xcite .",
    "various models have been proposed , primarily with random graph configuration , that incorporate these complex features while remaining theoretically tractable . within the context of disease dynamics ,",
    "graph nodes are generally taken to represent individuals , and edges to represent interactions between them , through which infection can spread .",
    "both deterministic and stochastic infection dynamics have been studied on networks as well as bond percolation for the associated branching process",
    "how various thermodynamic quantities of interest  such as the steady state incidence , the epidemic ( percolation ) threshold , and the distribution of small outbreak sizes  depend upon network topology is of great interest .",
    "often these approaches disregard the multiscale organization of many real systems , in which agents can be most naturally thought of as partitioned into densely connected communities with sparser coupling among neighboring communities . in some cases",
    ", it may be useful to conceptualize the topology as a network of networks , where agent - to - agent interactions and community - to - community interactions are both useful representations depending on the scale of resolution @xcite .",
    "the latter has been successfully developed in ecology , with a network of interconnected populations referred to as a  metapopulation \" @xcite .",
    "this framework is very useful in studying large scale propagation of diseases where most infection transmission occurs in localized regions , but can be transported on larger scales by the mobility of individuals , traveling among population centers @xcite .",
    "however , most metapopulation models assume that populations are fully mixed , with no inherent complexity in the connectivity between agents .",
    "much less understood is how the multiscale structure of agent interactions affects the larger scale propagation of infectious processes through interconnected networks @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "we expand on a possible avenue for addressing this question using a multitype generalization of random graphs with simple , meta - level topology @xcite , and construct a dynamical mean - field theory for the sir infection model in multitype configuration model networks . putting these together",
    ", we analyze the average infection dynamics and propagating front profile on a simple metapopulation composed of coupled population centers on a one - dimensional lattice and calculate the phenomenological transport properties of the system as functions of the underlying network s degree distributions .",
    "our results are compared to stochastic simulations of the infection kinetics on various networks and found to be in good agreement in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "broadly , we present this work as an illustration of how well - developed ideas from different areas of statistical physics and ecology can be naturally combined .",
    "in order to incorporate relevant node attribute information into our network models , ( generically applicable for such things as age , sex , ethnicity , and place of residence ) , we use a generalization of configuration model random graphs , wherein nodes are assigned a type from an arbitrary set of @xmath0 possible types and a degree to each type from an arbitrary joint distribution for degree types , @xmath1 , with degree @xmath2 denoting the number of connections to nodes of type @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "additionally , nodes of type @xmath4 occupy a fraction of the total network @xmath5 , where @xmath6 . following the configuration model prescription ,",
    "we consider graphs chosen uniformly at random from the ensemble of possible graphs with the prescribed degree distributions and self - consistent edge constraint : @xmath7@xcite .    from this formalism , a variety of quantities can be described compactly using generating functions @xcite .",
    "the generating function for the probability of a randomly selected node of type @xmath4 to have degree @xmath8 , is given by @xmath9 written as a power series in @xmath10 , an auxiliary variable defined over the unit interval , with expansion coefficients equal to the respective probabilities .",
    "moments of the degree distributions can be represented simply as derivatives of the corresponding generating function .",
    "for example , the average degree of a type @xmath4 node to a type @xmath3 node is @xmath11 since node interactions occur along edges , an important quantity in network models is the excess degree : the number of neighbors a node has which can be reached by selecting a randomly chosen edge , and not including the neighbor on the end of the selected edge . for a multiype configuration model network ,",
    "the probability that a randomly chosen edge from a type @xmath4 node leads to a type @xmath3 node with degree @xmath12 is proportional to @xmath13 , and thus the probability for the corresponding excess degree is generated by @xmath14 @xcite , with average degree to type @xmath15 nodes , @xmath16 by construction , this framework lacks two - point correlations , in which the excess degree distributions depend on the degrees of both nodes sharing an edge @xcite .",
    "in this report we consider simple dynamics for disease spread : the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model , wherein each individual is assigned a disease state , @xmath17 , and may undergo reactions to other states depending on its state and the state of its neighbors . in this model ,",
    "if a node of type @xmath4 is susceptible and has a single infected neighbor of type @xmath3 , then it will change its state to infected with a constant probability per unit time @xmath18 .",
    "likewise , an infected node of type @xmath4 will recover with a constant probability per unit time @xmath19 .",
    "since the underlying dynamics is a continuous time markov process , a complete analysis would describe the full probability distribution for all system trajectories .",
    "however for our purposes , it will be sufficient to focus on the behavior of extensive outbreaks ( i.e. , those which scale with the system size ) , the average dynamics of which , can be derived in the limit when the number of nodes tends to infinity , by generalizing a mean - field technique for single type networks , developed by volz and miller , to multitype networks .",
    "below , we follow the basic structure of the derivations presented in @xcite .    in the thermodynamic limit ,",
    "configuration model random graphs are locally tree - like @xcite , which by construction allows them to satisfy many of the generic criteria for the applicability of mean - field theory assumptions @xcite . in our case",
    ", we assume that nodes are differentiated by their degree and disease state alone and that susceptible nodes feel a uniform force of infection along every edge , related to the average number of edges connecting susceptible and infected nodes at any given time in the network : a curie - weiss type approximation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , from the perspective of susceptible nodes , all infection attempts along different edges can be treated as uncorrelated  a consequence of the local tree - like property @xcite and thus we assume that the states of neighbors of susceptible nodes are effectively independent .",
    "let the probability that a node of type @xmath3 has not transmitted the infection to a node of type @xmath4 along a randomly chosen @xmath20 edge , be @xmath21 .",
    "this quantity is interpretable as the complement of the average cumulative hazard function along such edges .",
    "given @xmath21 , it follows that the fraction of susceptible nodes of type @xmath4 at time @xmath22 is @xmath23 the fractions of infected and recovered nodes of type @xmath4 follow from probability conservation , @xmath24 , and a constant recovery rate for infected nodes @xmath19 : @xmath25 with the total fraction of susceptible nodes @xmath26    the central probability and order parameter , @xmath21 , can be subdivided into three compartments depending on the disease state of the terminal node @xmath3 , @xmath27 and its dynamics determined by tracking the fluxes among these compartments . since @xmath28 can only change when an infected node transmits the disease , the rate at which @xmath21 changes is equal to the rate at which a corresponding neighbor infects , and therefore @xmath29 .",
    "similarly , since @xmath30 can only change if an infected node recovers , the rate at which @xmath31 changes is equal to the rate at which a corresponding neighbor recovers , and thus @xmath32 .",
    "lastly , the probability that a type @xmath3 neighbor of a type @xmath4 node has not transmitted and is susceptible , @xmath33 , is simply the probability that the corresponding neighbor is susceptible .",
    "because this neighbor could not have been infected along any of its other edges and has excess degree distribution generated by @xmath14 , it follows that @xmath34 . combining the latter with the two flux relations and the initial conditions , @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ", we find    @xmath37    these @xmath38 , first - order and coupled odes , @xmath39 , define the full system s approximate mean dynamics , and form the basis of our subsequent analysis . for a more detailed derivation of the analogous results for the special case of a single type network , see @xcite .",
    "the steady state is given by the fixed point of , @xmath40 which upon substitution into , gives the cumulative infection , @xmath41 , at equilibrium ( i.e. , the final epidemic size ) , with @xmath42 the corresponding bond percolation probability , or transmissibility @xcite .",
    "this can have a non - trivial solution corresponding to the existence of extensive outbreaks , if the disease - free state , @xmath43 , is unstable .",
    "the threshold or phase transition , which signifies the region in parameter space that separates the epidemic and non - epidemic phases , can be obtained through a stability analysis of the disease - free state , where the eigenvalue of the jacobian for with the largest real part , is real and vanishes when @xmath44 an @xmath38x@xmath38 matrix @xcite .",
    "similar results for the equilibrium properties are derivable from a multitype bond percolation approach @xcite .",
    "of interest to us are systems where type structure adds an additional scale of relevant topology , and not just demographic complexity @xcite . for instance",
    ", we can apply the multitype network formalism to a simple model for a metapopulation by affiliating population centers with node types and coupling among populations with edges connecting their constituent nodes . in this way",
    ", a complex topology can be encoded on a micro - scale with a macro - scale adjacency matrix , @xmath45 , describing which populations are directly connected through node interactions @xcite .",
    "we envisage example systems where @xmath45 describes the connectivity among urban centers , such as cities , towns , or villages , facilitated by roads or airlines . by conceptualizing the topology in this manner",
    ", we can study the phenomenology of infection propagation among population centers and describe how the propagation properties depend on the underlying connectivity patterns .",
    "a schematic is shown in fig.[fig : schematic]-(a ) for a simple system with the pertinent structure .",
    "more broadly , we advance this approach as an avenue for combining the frameworks of network theory , metapopulations , and front propagation , which will be particularly useful if the interaction topology is coherent after some level of coarse graining .",
    ", we focus on a simple case with configuration model construction , where each site has an identical degree distribution , specifying the probability of having a given number of internal ( 0 ) , right ( + ) , and left ( - ) external edges ( shown above with labels for site @xmath4 ) . ]",
    "to illustrate this approach , we consider a special case of the above where the macro - scale topology is an infinite one - dimensional lattice , @xmath46 , in which agents interact with other agents of the same type and agents of neighboring types , @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "if infection is started at a single site ( e.g. , site @xmath48 ) in a fully susceptible system , a strict directionality applies : in order for site @xmath4 to be infected , sites @xmath49 must be infected first . in such a case ,",
    "we expect a well - defined infection front to propagate through the lattice . in keeping with the above",
    ", we focus on an effective force of infection model among populations with static configuration networks having prescribed degree distributions  a generalization of the paradigmatic , spatial sir model in one dimension , where the assumption of well mixed populations is relaxed to include complexity in agent interactions @xcite . a schematic",
    "is shown in fig.[fig : schematic]-(b ) .    since each node has three edge types , the mean equations of motion describe a three - component field , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 denote internal , right - external , and left - external edges , at the corresponding site .",
    "for simplicity , homogeneity is assumed , with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 all uniform  reducing the field equations to @xmath58 where the time , @xmath59 , is measured in units of @xmath60 , and the subscript in @xmath57 denotes a partial derivative with respect to the corresponding variable . for edge number consistency ,",
    "@xmath61 , but in general we allow for other asymmetries in the degree distributions .      to understand the spatio - temporal dynamics , we first quantify how perturbations away from the unstable state propagate by linearizing the dynamics around the disease - free equilibrium , @xmath62 , and decoupling the perturbations into basis modes using the inverse discrete fourier transform , @xmath63 , ( idft ) .",
    "the dispersion relation can be found by substituting the idft into and using the basis properties of orthogonality and completeness . in the limit @xmath46 the site perturbations approach the integral , @xmath64 .    with this prescription , we find the dispersion relation takes the form of a cubic , characteristic equation @xmath65 \\large \\frac{\\left < k_{0}^2\\right>}{\\left < k_{0}\\right>}-1 & \\frac{\\left < k_{0}k_{+}\\right>}{\\left < k_{0}\\right>}&\\frac{\\left < k_{0}k_{-}\\right>}{\\left < k_{0}\\right > } \\\\ \\frac{\\left < k_{-}k_{0}\\right>}{\\left < k_{-}\\right>}e^{-q}&\\frac{\\left < k_{-}k_{+}\\right>}{\\left < k_{-}\\right>}e^{-q } & \\left(\\frac{\\left < k_{-}^2\\right>}{\\left < k_{-}\\right>}\\!-\\!1\\right)e^{-q}\\\\ \\frac{\\left < k_{+}k_{0}\\right>}{\\left < k_{+}\\right>}e^{q } & \\left(\\frac{\\left <",

    "we expect this operator to emerge in similar problems on interconnected networks .",
    "combining the above with the behavior of infection near the phase transition , where there is no exponential growth in time and each site has the same field value : @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we find a simple condition for the critical transmissibility @xmath74 : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the maximum eigenvalue of @xmath71 , with @xmath77 corresponding to @xmath70 . because the addition of external edges increases the spreading capacity of the disease , the critical transmissibility in the coupled system is less than the uncoupled case , implying that transport - mediated infections from neighboring sites can sustain epidemics even when individual populations on their own can not @xcite .    also from the dispersion relation ,",
    "we can find the asymptotic transport coefficients for rightward moving disturbances by making a standard saddle - point - approximation of the perturbations integral representation in fourier space : expanding the integrand around its dominant contribution , @xmath78 , in the co - moving frame , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and taking the infinite time limit while enforcing approximate constancy with no exponential growth and @xmath81 finite  where @xmath82 is the asymptotic speed at which perturbations to the unstable state propagate @xcite .",

    "furthermore , the normalized diffusion coefficient increases from zero with @xmath104 and @xmath105  the correlation moments of the degree distribution which encode the propensity for transport from the @xmath106 site to the @xmath107 site ( both of which can not be zero , otherwise epidemics are locally confined ) , and with the viability of subdominant modes to support growth . in general , we find that as @xmath102 increases : @xmath82 and @xmath94 increase , @xmath89 decreases , and @xmath96 remains constant , implying faster transport and greater similarity among sites , as more edge - type pairs allow for traversing the lattice , but with little change in the growth exponent .",
    "the above demonstrates the typical trend for these models , that the front dynamics is strongly influenced by the joint degree distribution s second moments ( i.e. , the relevant excess degree properties are generally amplified by correlation among degree types and degree heterogeneity ) . for example , in analogy with the single network case , fast transport can be achieved with the presence of a few nodes with large internal and external degrees , or  transport hubs \" , even if the average degrees in the network are small @xcite",

    ", there are two types of deterministic fronts : pulled and pushed , with the former having fronts with asymptotic speed equal to the linear spreading speed and the latter having fronts with asymptotic speed greater than the linear spreading speed @xcite .",
    "pushed fronts occur because nonlinearities in the equations of motion tend to increase the growth of perturbations on the unstable state , resulting in nontrivial front shape dependence of the speed .",

    "the classification has importance for control strategies in systems with similar structure , implying that to mitigate the spread of infection among populations , efforts should be focused on the leading edge of the front , and not on larger outbreaks occurring farther behind .",

    "both the epidemic size for various transmissibilities and the threshold were found to be in good agreement with mean - field predictions , though the finite - size effects became increasingly important as the critical region was approached , leading to significantly smaller outbreaks near the edges of the lattice .",
    "in this paper we have generalized a mean - field theory for infection dynamics on multitype networks , and used such networks to model multiscale metapopulations .",
    "together , this enabled us to explore how macro - scale disease propagation depends on micro - scale interaction structure .",
    "as a necessary first step in this direction , we applied the approach to a simple metapopulation model for a chain of coupled populations , and derived the transport properties for infection , including their scaling with the disease transmissibility and the statistical properties of the underlying network .",
    "we also found a threshold for the viability of epidemics , and calculated the relaxation properties of the propagating front .",
    "these were compared for different network models , with heterogeneous networks having considerably higher speeds and broader fronts than their homogeneous counterparts  illustrating the importance of including complexity in the fine - scale topology in order to accurately capture transport phenomenology .",
    "various extensions of the work presented  both in terms of analyses carried out and systems studied  could be considered .",
    "we have addressed here only the average dynamics of the one - dimensional , homogeneous system , without any description of finite - size fluctuations , or consideration of the dynamics in higher - dimensional generalizations .",
    "greater complexity could be introduced through the spatio - temporal dependence of network parameters , and/or more general network configurations @xcite .",
    "an interesting extension of the model discussed here would include dynamic contacts between nodes and explicit mobility , instead of the assumed time scale separation between topology and the overlying process @xcite .",
    "however , the basic formalism presented here can enable one to study such factors and build more realistic models for infectious processes in multiscale problems .",
