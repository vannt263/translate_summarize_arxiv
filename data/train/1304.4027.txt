    "they interpret this as a manifestation of alfvn waves in the solar atmosphere . however , there is some ambiguity whether they deal with spectral or integrated intensities .    motivated by the results of jess _ et al . _ ( 2009 ) , we search for signatures of alfvn waves in a bright network element occupied by a cluster of g - band bright points .",
    "we investigate spectral characteristics of the h@xmath0  spectral line , focusing on temporal variations of the line core width , intensity , dopplershift , and the asymmetry derived by a @xmath1-order - polynomial fitting of a coarse five - point sampling of the h@xmath0  profile . since we employ the correcting method and results of koza _ et al . _",

    "a time step between the five - wavelength scans of the h@xmath0  line profile and line center images is 30s .",
    "since the images at two subsequent wavelengths are separated by the 4-to-5-s intervals , one full 5-point scan of the h@xmath0  profile took about 20 - 25s . within this interval no major changes of chromospheric scenery are assumed .",
    "the scans were taken in 20-frame bursts per particular wavelength setting and then speckle - reconstructed applying a keller - von der lhe two - channel reconstruction ( keller & von der lhe , 1992 ) .",

    "the coarse five - point sampling enables us to construct @xmath17 instantaneous proxy profiles of the h@xmath0  spectral line at each pixel .",
    "we fit the five - wavelength samples of the proxy profiles by a @xmath1-order polynomial to derive the four basic profile measurements : the core intensity @xmath18 , the core velocity @xmath19 , the core width _",

    "the values of @xmath18  and @xmath19  represent the fit minimum and its dopplershift , respectively .",
    "the core width is the wavelength separation of the two fit flanks at half of the intensity range between the fit minimum and the average of the endpoint intensities at @xmath7 .",
    "the core width is computed at the average intensity @xmath21  employing the reference intensity @xmath22 defined by equations  ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) in paperi .",
    "finally , the bisector velocity is the velocity equivalent of the wavelength separation between the midpoint of the fit at the average intensity @xmath21  and the fit minimum .",
    "a more detailed definition of the spectral characteristics is given in paperi . in case of a large dopplershift , when the average intensity is larger than the minimum of endpoint intensities , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath23 , the fits are extrapolated beyond the range @xmath7  using the polynomial coefficients and the extrapolated fits are used for determining the spectral characteristics . in very rare cases of a polynomial undulation , with local maxima lower than the average intensity @xmath21",
    ", the algorithm switches to a parabolic fit of the five - point proxy profile to determine _ fw _ , while @xmath18  and @xmath19  are always from the @xmath1-order - polynomial fit and @xmath20  is undefined . the extrapolation ( fig.[fig8 ] )",
    "was invoked just in 0.024% and the parabolic fit in @xmath24% out of all pixels .",
    "the intensities shown in figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] were normalized with respect to the mean intensities resulting from spatio - temporal averaging of the respective image cubes .",
    "the five mean intensities were converted to the atlas intensity scale convolving the h@xmath0  atlas profile with the transmission profile of the dot h@xmath0  filter ( paperi , equation  ( 1 ) ) .",
    "therefore , the integrated intensities in figs.[fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] are in the wavelength unit .",
    "the five intensity samples have an instrumental wavelength scale ranging from @xmath25 to 0.7 .",
    "the wavelengths of particular core fit minima @xmath26 are measured with respect to this instrumental wavelength scale with millingstrm resolution and then converted to the core velocity as : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the speed of light , @xmath29 is the central wavelength of the h@xmath0  line 6562.8 , and the reference wavelength @xmath30 is the spatio - temporal average of all @xmath31 wavelengths of fit minima @xmath26 over all pixels within the field of view , making no distinction between network and internetwork pixels .",
    "the reference wavelength @xmath30 is about @xmath32m .",
    "an adopted sign convention indicates a redshift of the line core fit for positive dopplershift and @xmath19 .",
    "the bisector velocity @xmath20  quantifies an asymmetry of the line core fit with respect to its minimum .",
    "the sign convention adopted in paperi  suggests positive @xmath20  for a line core fit with a redward asymmetry .    to eliminate the modulation of the spectral characteristics induced by the fast - changing blanket of dark fibrils , we construct 71 proxy h@xmath0  profiles by spatial averaging of intensities within the selected network element ( figs.[fig4][fig7 ] ) at each wavelength .",
    "fig.[fig9 ] shows examples of these spatially averaged intensities , their polynomial fits , average intensities , and core velocities .",
    "spectral characteristics of these spatially averaged intensities are determined solely from their @xmath33-order - polynomial non - extrapolated fits . to asses",
    "an influence of the averaging on the final results , we compare them with the instantaneous characteristics obtained by the spatial averaging of _ fw _ , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  within the selected area ( figs.[fig4][fig7 ] ) . both , the instantaneous spectral characteristics inferred per pixel and also from the spatially averaged intensities are corrected for the deviations estimated in paperi   comparing the measurements of _ fw _ , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  performed at the dopplershifted h@xmath0  atlas profile convolved with the filter transmission with their reference values . then the corrected core velocity @xmath19  is the solution of the equation @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the absolute deviation @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the measured core velocity .",
    "the corrected _ fw _  results from the equation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the measured fit width and @xmath40 is the absolute deviation @xmath41 , but interpolated on the corrected core velocity @xmath19 .",
    "the corrected @xmath20  is computed in the same way . due to different intensity scales , the corrected @xmath18  results from the equation @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the measured core intensity and @xmath44 is the relative deviation @xmath45 , but interpolated on the corrected core velocity @xmath19 .",
    "reliability of results inferred by fitting depends critically on the noise presented in the data and various intrinsic uncertainties .",
    "therefore , in this section we give a brief account of uncertainties of the fitted intensities and the reference wavelength defining the core velocity .",
    "we estimated the upper limit of the noise level @xmath46 presented in the h@xmath0  filtergrams from @xmath47 of the temporal variations of the intensity at each pixel assuming that @xmath48 .",
    "in other words , we assumed that the noise level is about one order smaller than @xmath47 of the temporal variations of the intensity due to physical processes on the sun within the 71-min observing period .",
    "this rough estimate points out that these @xmath46 errors of the intensities in fig.[fig8 ] are smaller than the height of the square symbols and can therefore be neglected .",
    "similarly , we estimated the noise level of the spatially - averaged intensities in fig.[fig9 ] from @xmath47 of the spatial variations of the intensity over the selected area .",
    "in other words , we assumed that the per - pixel noise level within the area is @xmath47 of intensity variations over the area .",
    "however , the spatial averaging of the intensities reduces their noise level by a factor of @xmath49 or @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the number of averaged pixels",
    ". this again points out , that the errors of intensities in fig.[fig9 ] are much smaller than the height of the square symbols and are thus insignificant .    in this paper",
    ", we define the reference wavelength @xmath30 , or zero point of the core velocity , as the spatio - temporal average of the wavelengths @xmath26 of the core fit minima determined at each pixel .",
    "we estimated uncertainty or stability of @xmath30 during the 71-min observing period in two ways .",
    "first , we constructed 71 proxy h@xmath0  profiles from instantaneous spatially - averaged intensities , determined the wavelengths of their core fit minima , and computed the median of their absolute differences from the total average .",
    "second , we took 71 spatial averages of the wavelengths of core fit minima for each moment of the observation and computed again the median of their absolute differences from the total average .",
    "both estimates gave consistent results , indicating that uncertainty of the reference wavelength @xmath30 of the core velocity is about @xmath52kms@xmath2 .",
    "when determining the reference wavelength @xmath30 we made no distinction between the network and internetwork areas and this might be a source of a systematic offset .",
    "we checked this feature by selecting only large internetwork areas for determination of @xmath30 .",
    "this one is blueshifted about 0.2kms@xmath2  with respect to the reference wavelength from the whole field of view .",
    "this section presents a pictorial overview of results inferred from the data undergone various processing .",
    "gray shades in figs.[fig10 ]  [ fig12 ] highlight differences between the uncorrected ( gray ) and corrected ( black ) data , while the different styles distinguish the results of intensity averaging ( solid lines ) and spatial averaging of spectral characteristics ( symbols ) over the network element .",
    "the top panel of fig.[fig10 ] shows temporal evolutions of the relative variations of the fit width _",
    "fw _  and the core intensity @xmath18  of the line core fits of the h@xmath0  spectral line in the network element ( figs.[fig4][fig7 ] ) with respect to their temporal means .",
    "the bottom panel shows temporal evolutions of the core velocity @xmath19  and the bisector velocity @xmath20 , whose positive values indicate redshift and redward asymmetry of the line core .",
    "all these characteristics were derived from the original h@xmath0  datacubes downloaded from the dot database .",
    "an application of the corrections ( paperi ) increases apparently the amplitude of the _ fw _  variations after the @xmath53min , but decreases both velocities within the whole 71-min period .",
    "the values of _ fw _  and @xmath18  seem to be largely insensitive to the choice of averaging for the size of the selected area , but this is not the case of @xmath19  and @xmath20 . their corrected values resulting from spatial averaging over the network element ( black diamonds and triangles in the bottom panel ) differ systematically from the values inferred from spatial means of the intensities ( black thick and thin lines ) .",
    "this is probably due to high non - linearity of the respective correcting functions shown in paperi .",
    "the temporal evolutions of the characteristics do not show any apparent systematic trend and fast short - period variations dominate them .",
    "the variations of corrected _ fw _  are within the range @xmath4% around the mean .",
    "the variations of @xmath18  indicate a rapid darkening of the selected network element ( fig.[fig4 ] ) from 11% above an average to average within the first 10 minutes .",
    "later on , @xmath18  variations lie within the range from @xmath54% to @xmath55% .",
    "the corrected @xmath19  displays redshifts up to 4kms@xmath2 , with an average of 1.5kms@xmath2  and a noticeable correlation with the corrected _ fw _ , most apparent after the fortieth minute . in the same period , a large expanding granule with the maximum diameter larger than 2arcsec appeared in the low photosphere ( see figs.[fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "fig.[fig10 ] suggests also some similarity between the @xmath19  and @xmath18  variations .",
    "the fourier cross correlation indicates that @xmath18  lags behind @xmath19  about 2.1min on average .",
    "the h@xmath0  core possesses mostly a redward asymmetry corresponding to an inverse - c bisector with the average bisector velocity of about 0.5kms@xmath2  with excursions up to 1kms@xmath2 .",
    "the spectral characteristics from fig.[fig10 ] are displayed in the form of scatter plots in figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , showing separately the results of spatial averaging of the intensities and the spectral characteristics at each pixel , respectively .",
    "the top left panels show _ fw _  against @xmath18  which do not correlate , neither uncorrected nor corrected .",
    "the top right panels suggest a positive correlation between _ fw _  and @xmath19 , which occurs only for the corrected values .",
    "the correlation implies that more redshifted profiles tend to be wider .",
    "the middle panels indicate that there is no apparent correspondence between @xmath18  and the velocities .",
    "the values of @xmath18  do not correlate with @xmath19 , not even after shifting @xmath18  forward ( _ i.e. _ , to the left with respect to the zero of the time axis ) about 2.1min to compensate its apparent lag indicated in fig.[fig10 ] .",
    "the bottom left panel of fig.[fig12 ] suggests an anticorrelation between @xmath20  and _ fw _ , which occurs only for the corrected values resulting from their spatial averaging at each pixel .",
    "the anticorrelation implies that while narrower h@xmath0  cores display a redward asymmetry , the wider and more redshifted profiles ( see the _ fw _  ",
    "@xmath19  correlation above ) display a blueward asymmetry .",
    "the bottom right panels also suggest a striking anticorrelation between @xmath20  and @xmath19 .",
    "notably , the profiles with the zero dopplershift display a redward asymmetry with @xmath20  = 1kms@xmath2  and become symmetric for @xmath19  of 2kms@xmath2 , but tend to display an increasing blueward asymmetry with further - increasing redshift .",
    "we derived spectral characteristics of the h@xmath0  spectral line observed in the network element with the aim of seeking signatures of the alfvn waves as reported in jess _ et al . _",
    "how do our findings compare to the results of these authors ?",
    "while jess _ et al .",
    "_ ( 2009 ) reported an average blueshift of 23kms@xmath2  in a cluster of bright points seen in h@xmath0 , we found an average redshift of about 1.5kms@xmath2 . obviously , this is a large discrepancy and we suspect that our particular choice of the reference wavelength of the core velocity might be partially responsible for that .",
    "we remind that we made no distinction between the network and internetwork ( see section[datanal ] ) . but as we showed in section[errors ] , selecting only internetwork areas shifts the reference wavelength blueward only insignificantly up to 0.2kms@xmath2  and the value of the average redshift is significantly above the uncertainty of 0.3kms@xmath2  of the reference wavelength .",
    "further , jess _ et al . _",
    "( 2009 ) reported an absence of any significant intensity variations in the cluster of bright points .",
    "however , there is some uncertainty whether they refer to the spectral intensity in the line core , or the integrated intensity .",
    "our results suggest that the core width variations in the selected network element are associated with both the core velocity and core intensity variations .",
    "finally , the authors detected _ fwhm _ oscillations of the h@xmath0  spectral line with the strongest power in the 400-to-500s interval .",
    "we postpone detailed cross correlation , fourier , and wavelet analyzes of our results to a forthcoming paper .",
    "we conclude that , most likely , a different mechanism works in the selected network element than in the cluster of the bright points studied by jess _",
    "the inverse - c bisector and the average redshift of the h@xmath0  line core are more symptomatic for propagation of chromospheric shocks , as suggested in uitenbroek ( 2006 ) and demonstrated in numerical simulations by heggland _",
    "then the lagging of the core intensity @xmath18  behind the core velocity @xmath19  variations about 2.1min might be characteristic either for the _ p_-mode oscillations leaking into the chromosphere , or for the shock wave propagation .",
    "although there is an apparent similarity of their variations best seen after the fortieth minute ( fig.[fig10 ] ) , shifting @xmath18  forward about the 2-min lag does not improve the @xmath18  ",
    "@xmath19  correlations shown in the middle right panels of the scatter plots in figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , which may be ascribed to a variable phase shift which varies in time and/or frequency .",
    "since the standard dot observations do not involve any precise wavelength calibration of the h@xmath0  filtergrams , we refrained from interpreting straightforwardly redshifts and blueshifts as actual mass downflows and upflows , respectively . despite these facts",
    ", we will try to reason that most of the positive values of @xmath19  indicated by the redshifts of the h@xmath0  core may represent the actual mass downflows . as we noted in section[obs ] , the zero wavelength of the filtergrams is centered on the minimum of an average profile taken before the observations over the field of view . thus , the zero wavelength approximately corresponds to the h@xmath0  solar disc - center wavelength of @xmath56  according to the spectral fts atlas by neckel ( 1999 ) , whose wavelength scale was already corrected for the rotational and radial velocity of the earth .",
    "consequently , the reference wavelength given in section[datanal ] corresponds to @xmath57  = 6562.79 .",
    "the local standard of rest at the solar surface for the h@xmath0  spectral line is : @xmath58 , where @xmath59  is the air laboratory wavelength of h@xmath0  adopted from the nist database ( kramida _ et .",
    "al _ , 2012 ) , @xmath60kms@xmath2  is the solar gravitational redshift , and @xmath28 is the speed of light .",
    "then the core velocities of h@xmath0  measured within this study are offset only about @xmath61kms@xmath2  with respect to the local standard of rest at the target area , with the following consequences :    * the zero of @xmath19  and all values of @xmath20  in fig.[fig10 ] should be shifted redward ( _ i.e. _ , up ) about 0.5kms@xmath2 , * the zeros of the @xmath19  axes in figs.[fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] should be shifted redward ( _ i.e. _ , to the right ) about 0.5kms@xmath2 , * most of the positive values of @xmath19  indicated by the redshifts of the h@xmath0  core may represent the actual mass downflows .",
    "a selected network element exhibits distinct spectral characteristics seen in their temporal evolutions and scatter plots correlating pairs of values from the same instant . in general , this involves :    * the fit width variations about @xmath4% , _",
    "i.e. _ , a few tens of millingstrms with respect to the average of 1.01 , * the core intensity variations about @xmath3% with respect to the average , * the core velocity variations from 0 to 4kms@xmath2  about the average of 1.5kms@xmath2 , implying a redshift , * the core asymmetry variations of the h@xmath0  line core up to 1kms@xmath2  about the average of 0.5kms@xmath2 , suggesting an inverse - c bisector .",
    "the h@xmath0  core width tends to correlate with the dopplershift and anticorrelate with the asymmetry , suggesting that more redshifted h@xmath0  profiles are wider and the broadening of the h@xmath0  core is accompanied with a change of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward .",
    "we found also a striking anticorrelation between the core asymmetry and the dopplershift , suggesting also a change of the core asymmetry from redward to blueward , with an increasing redshift of the h@xmath0  core .",
    "a question is which of these patterns are unique just for the network and which are also common in the internetwork .",
    "this can be resolved in a stand - alone study , comparing the spectral characteristics of the h@xmath0  line in the network and internetwork .",
    "finally , an absence of blueshift and detected intensity and velocity variations probably exclude a presence of alfvn waves in the selected network element according to the criteria given in jess _ et al . _",
