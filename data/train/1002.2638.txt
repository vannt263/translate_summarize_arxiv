    "ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) are energetic particles ( @xmath1 ev ) that must originate in the most powerful particle accelerators in the universe .",
    "these extreme events have fascinated scientists from the time of their discovery in 1962 @xcite . since then , speculation about their origin has flourished @xcite . theoretically , active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have long been favored as the best candidates for particle acceleration to these extreme energies @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no firm astrophysical association has been established .",
    "possibly the most intriguing suggestion of an association between uhecrs and agn was put forward by the _ pierre auger _ collaboration @xcite that found a possible correlation between the arrival direction of 27 events collected in their southern observatory and the position of nearby ( @xmath2 mpc ) agn from the vern - cetty catalog @xcite .",
    "the correlation remains but has weakened slightly with the inclusion of additional uhecr events ( for a grand total of 58 ) collected between 2004 january and 2009 march @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , questions remain about the likelihood of the reported correlation @xcite .",
    "it is expected that if agn are responsible for uhecrs , these must be preferentially placed within a distance of 100 mpc @xcite .",
    "interactions with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons should starve uhecrs arriving from larger distances through the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) effect @xcite .",
    "in fact , a combination of recent observations appear to corroborate the existence of a suppression of uhecrs above @xmath3 ev consistent with a gzk horizon @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that recent results from the _ pierre auger _ collaboration point to a transition to heavier composition with increasing energies @xcite . if indeed iron nuclei are the dominant component of uhecrs , the large deviation angles expected for heavy nuclei would render the detection of astrophysical counterparts even the nearest ones nearly impossible @xcite .    here ,",
    "we present a cross - correlation study of uhecrs and the recently released  large area telescope first source catalog ( 1fgl ) in the 100 mev to 100 gev energy range @xcite .",
    "in contrast with previous studies , our cross - correlation analysis is unique in that the  catalog comprises a wide range of _ bona fide _ particle accelerators with gamma - ray production above @xmath4 mev directed in the earth s direction .",
    "the large area telescope on board   offers a major improvement in sensitivity over previous gev detectors @xcite . in its survey observation mode",
    ", the lat observes the entire sky every 3 hours",
    ". for individual sources ,  provides nearly uniform sky coverage down to a photon flux of @xmath5 @xmath6 s@xmath7 between 1 and 100 gev , except for sources at low galactic latitude ( @xmath8 ) where the diffuse emission dominates @xcite . throughout the paper ,",
    "we assume an @xmath971 km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 cosmological model .",
    "as of 2007 november , the public catalog of uhecrs released by the _ pierre auger _",
    "collaboration contains 27 events with energies above 55 eev collected at their site in malarge , argentina @xcite .",
    "the  lat 1fgl catalog consists of 1451 sources characterized in the 100 mev100 gev energy range @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained in an all - sky scanning mode during 2008 august2009 july and represents the most extensive map of the gamma - ray sky ( @xmath12 mev ) ever obtained .",
    "the entire catalog includes 689 blazars , two starburst galaxies , two radio galaxies , 56 pulsars , 50 supernova remnants , and 630 unidentified sources @xcite .    since we are interested in testing for possible correlations of uhecrs with various classes of gamma - ray emitters in the mev - gev energy range without any _ a priori _ assumption , we take advantage of the complete 1fgl catalog without any redshift or type discrimination .    to test for a possible cross - correlation between uhecrs and  sources in the 1fgl catalog",
    ", we checked whether the individual uhecr positions in the _ pierre auger _",
    "sample are clearly contained within the error circle of individual sources listed in the 1fgl catalog .",
    "specifically , we count correlations whenever an uhecr event is within a circle of @xmath0 radius around a particular  source .",
    "this radius is in line with the value predicted by conventional models of cosmic ray trajectories that consider the full effect of the galactic magnetic field @xcite . in order to avoid `` multiple '' counts",
    ", we only consider one match per individual uhecr event .    within the 27 uhecr events",
    ", we find 12 matches with 1fgl sources . to examine the likelihood of such correlation",
    ", we used the batse 4b gamma - ray burst ( grb ) catalog @xcite in place of a random generator of isotropic sky positions that allows us to generate artificial samples of simulated uhecrs .",
    "the batse 4b catalog consists of 1637 grb positions localized by the batse instrument on board the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) in the period between 1991 april 19 and 1996 august 29 . for our work ,",
    "we restricted our analysis to events that would be accessible from the _ pierre auger _ southern site at a declination @xmath13 @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "in addition , we assume that the fraction of exposure is the same accross the declination range as stated in @xcite .",
    "after the proper cuts were applied , we drew 100 random sets of 27 events from the resulting `` southern '' batse 4b catalog to match the uhecr sample .",
    "we next proceeded to correlate each of the 100 random sets with the 1451  sources in the same manner as with the original _ pierre auger _",
    "dataset .",
    "figure  [ figure1 ] shows the distribution of matches between the artificial samples of uhecrs constructed from the batse 4b catalog and the 1fgl catalog .",
    "in particular , 63@xmath15 of the artificial samples have 12 or more matches consistent with  positions .",
    "allowing for larger circles ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 radii ) only increases the number of false positives when compared with the batse sample to 71@xmath15 and 73@xmath15 respectively .",
    "if the position of _ pierre auger _ events were strongly correlated with  sources , we would expect a greater number of coincidences when compared with the outcomes of randomly - generated artificial sets of uhecr events drawn from the batse 4b grb catalog .",
    "we find no evidence for such an association and subsequently can not claim a positive cross - correlation between uhecrs and the 1fgl catalog .",
    "in summary , we find no cross - correlation between uhecrs and 1fgl sources that can not be reproduced by chance alignment .",
    "this differs from the findings reported by @xcite , using a different agn sample ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "examining the matches between the _ pierre auger _",
    "events and the 1fgl catalog in closer detail , we notice that the sample includes one pulsar , two unidentified sources , and eight agn .",
    "four of the agn have measured well beyond the gzk horizon with redshifts as high as @xmath18 .",
    "the lowest redshifts correspond to centaurus a ( @xmath19 ) and ngc 4945 ( @xmath19 ) , as we shall discuss later .",
    "the remaining two agn associations have no spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "one could argue that the aforementioned agn without spectroscopic redshifts could potentially form a parent population for uhecrs .",
    "if it was , these agn would most likely lie at distances closer than 100 mpc @xcite .",
    "optical imaging studies of bl lac reveal that the host galaxies of nearby agn with jets pointed in our direction tend to cluster around a mean absolute magnitude in the @xmath20 band equivalent to @xmath21 @xcite . for distances closer than 100 mpc",
    ", this would correspond to an apparent @xmath20-band magnitude @xmath22 or brighter .",
    "a quick analysis of optical digitized sky survey images centered on the positions of the two matched agn without spectroscopic redshifts reveals no optical sources brighter than @xmath23 at the derived agn positions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that any of the paired uhecrs / agn are located within the hypothesized gzk horizon at 100 mpc .",
    "interestingly , we do recover the two uhecrs previously associated with the radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite and one uhecr consistent with the position of the starburst / seyfert 2 ngc 4945 @xcite .",
    "both centaurus a ( 1fgl j1325.6@xmath244300 ) and ngc 4945 ( 1fgl j1305.4@xmath244928 ) are detected by . however , ngc 4945 only stands out as one of the two seyfert 2 galaxies in the 1fgl catalog rather than for its qualifications as a uhecr accelerator @xcite . on the other hand , radio galaxies such as centaurus",
    "a could potentially account for the acceleration of some uhecrs to energies @xmath25 eev @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is important to continue to explore the connection ( if any ) between uhecrs and centaurus a. however , it is troubling that 24 uhecr events detected by _ pierre auger _ remain without an apparent  gamma - ray counterpart within 100 mpc ( we dub these `` orphan '' uhecrs ) .",
    "in fact , there seems to be an apparent dearth of nearby agn detected in gamma rays at distances less than 100 mpc ( @xmath26 ) . to see this more clearly ,",
    "figure  [ figure2 ] shows the distribution for  agn in the redshift range @xmath27 @xcite . in total",
    ", there are only five objects with @xmath26 that would be accessible to the _ pierre auger _",
    "southern site namely ngc 253 ( @xmath28 ) , ngc 4945 ( @xmath19 ) , centaurus a ( @xmath19 ) , m 87 ( @xmath29 ) , and eso 323-g77 ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "ngc 4945 ( being generous ) and centaurus a could potentially account for 3 of the 27 uhecr events as discussed above .",
    "however , we remark that there are no additional identified  sources in the 100 mev-100 gev energy band to account for the bulk of uhecrs seen by _",
    "pierre auger _",
    "so far .",
    "it is possible that other agn remain unidentified in the 1fgl catalog , as implied by the observed north - south anisotropy of the associated sources , which might reflect the incompleteness of the existing agn catalogs in other bands @xcite .",
    "however , the remainder is expected to lie in the lower end of the gamma - ray flux distribution , and therefore in principle not represent the most efficient particle accelerators .",
    "in addition , some agn are known to be highly variable , therefore we can not fully discard that some sources have escaped  detection and possible correlation with uhecrs because of a low state .     and @xmath31 .",
    "northern ( decl @xmath32 @xmath14 ) and southern ( decl @xmath13 @xmath14 ) samples are shown in blue ( dashed line ) and grey ( solid line ) respectively .",
    "only five identified  sources have @xmath33 and are accessible to the _ pierre auger _ southern site .",
    "the vertical line marks a distance of 100 mpc .",
    ", width=297 ]    accordingly , one must admit one or all of the following possibilities : 1 ) if uhecrs are truly accelerated within the current sample of detected  sources , their trajectories must experience deviations greater than @xmath0 from their actual astrophysical origin , making the identification of uhecrs nearly intractable .",
    "in particular , the absence of astrophysical counterparts could be well justified if uhecrs are dominated by heavy nuclei including iron since the deviation scales linearly the atomic number @xmath34 , 2 ) there could potentially exist an undetected population of nearby agn ",
    "the so called proton blazars ?",
    "@xcite  that only emit in a very narrow band above 100 gev to be discovered by future vhe experiments such as the cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) or the advanced gamma imaging system ( agis ) , and 3 ) the absence of obvious particle accelerators in the mev - gev energy band leaves some room for the exploration of additional forms of particle acceleration and even exotic possibilities .    trying to narrow down future observational directions , it is important to search for possible timing / directional correlations of the arrival direction of cosmic ray with agn flares .",
    "such exercise currently lacks the dedicated sky monitoring that could potentially identify the majority of agn flares in real time .",
    "it would also require the rapid release of uhecr detections ( including position ) in real time . the existing fleet of mev - tev telescopes including _ agile _ , h.e.s.s . ,",
    "magic , and veritas could help trace strong flares in the gamma - ray band .",
    "however , groundbreaking progress into the gamma - ray variability domain might have to wait for the next generation of vhe experiments . in the theoretical front , it is critical to improve existing models of cosmic ray propagation .",
    "in particular , based on current cross - correlation studies , the initial expectation that cosmic ray trajectories at energies @xmath1 ev should be fairly rigid does not appear to be so obvious .",
