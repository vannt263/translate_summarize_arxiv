    "over the past two decades , remarkable gaps in our understanding of matter have been revealed ",
    "astrophysical observations @xcite by now overwhelmingly indicate that only about 4% of the matter and energy in the universe can be of standard model origin .",
    "indeed , one can not attribute the remaining 21% of dark matter or 75% of dark energy to standard model matter or its vacuum energy .",
    "for on the one hand , does the bullet cluster @xcite show the existence of only gravitationally interacting dark matter . on the other hand",
    "does the calculation of dark energy as the vacuum energy of standard model fields yield a result that is infamously off the observed value by 120 order of magnitude @xcite , which is jokingly referred to as the worst prediction of elementary particle physics .",
    "it is consensus that these observations thus point at something fundamental we do not understand about matter or gravity .",
    "going deeper than just postulating modified lagrangians for either matter or gravity , however , one quickly realizes that modifying matter and gravity dynamics independently quickly becomes inconsistent .",
    "this is because they both build on  and more importantly , are both tightly constrained by  the common underlying spacetime geometry .    for the einstein equations , on the one hand , present the unique dynamics with a well - posed initial value problem one can give to a lorentzian manifold @xcite . thus modifying gravitational dynamics",
    "necessarily comes at the cost of deviating from lorentzian geometry as the spacetime structure .",
    "this is illustrated for instance by brans - dicke gravity and its avatars as well as @xmath0 gravity theories , which all feature at least an additional scalar gravitational degree of freedom .",
    "but then one needs to couple matter fields to the corresponding modified spacetime geometry , and one sees that modifying gravitational dynamics compels one to think about modified matter dynamics .",
    "vice versa , even minimal deviations from the standard model of particle physics on the other hand quickly produce matter dynamics whose causality does not coincide with the causality defined by the underlying lorentzian manifold . famously , this surprisingly already happens for some fully covariant lagrangians @xcite .",
    "if one wishes to consider such matter dynamics on a lorentzian manifold , let alone any even slightly more exotic matter , one requires also modified gravity dynamics to provide backgrounds that make the matter equations causal .",
    "thus unless one entertains the claim that all matter that could exist in nature must be made precisely in the image of maxwell theory  which in the face of 96therefore if one sets out to modify the otherwise time - tested theory of einstein gravity coupled to standard model dynamics , the intimate link between consistent matter dynamics and gravitational field equations compels one to be particularly careful , and base any modification on a common underlying geometry that is so constrained as to make the combined theory work . at the very least",
    ", it is to be physically required that the spacetime geometry render the entirety of observed matter field dynamics coupling to it predictive , interpretable and quantizable . ]",
    "the identification of all tensorial geometries complying with these minimum criteria and the determination of their gravitational dynamics is the purpose of the present paper .    fortunately , these rather fundamental physical conditions translate into three simple algebraic conditions @xcite that an otherwise arbitrary tensor field must satisfy in order to provide a valid spacetime geometry :    it must be hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing , as we will explain in the first technical section below .",
    "thus the spectrum of tensor fields that can serve as a spacetime structure in the presence of specific matter field dynamics is greatly restricted .",
    "so restricted , in fact , that all kinematical constructions familiar from the special case of lorentzian metrics can be made , for precisely the same structural reasons , also for any such tensorial spacetime .",
    "the deeper dynamical principles behind einstein s field equations , which were revealed by arnowitt , deser and misner @xcite a long time ago , are fortunately not swept away with a change from lorentzian geometry to one of the alternative tensorial geometries described above . from the geometrodynamical point of view , gravitational dynamics is all about evolving the spatial geometry from one suitable initial data surface to an infinitesimally neighbouring one , such that ultimately all spatial geometries recombine to an admissible spacetime geometry ; indeed , applying this principle , hojmann , kuchar and teitelboim @xcite derived the einstein - hilbert action with numerically undetermined gravitational and cosmological constants as the unique dynamics for the special case when the tensorial geometry is in fact a lorentzian metric . but this geometrodynamic principle stands for any tensorial spacetime geometry .",
    "] and it is the purpose of the present article to show that the very same principle indeed determines the dynamics of any hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing tensorial spacetime geometry .",
    "but indeed only of such .",
    "the main result of this article , beyond its technical details , is thus the observation that the search for gravitational dynamics beyond general relativity can be reduced to solving a mathematical representation problem .",
    "this is achieved by invoking precisely the same geometrodynamic principles as followed by @xcite , but applied to any hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing tensorial spacetime geometry . as a consequence , gravitational dynamics ( including and beyond modified gravity actions for lorentzian manifolds , over various actions for non - symmetric or scalar - tensor extensions of the gravitational field , dynamics for the affine connection rather than a metric , and finally to string - geometry inspired proposals of various sorts .",
    "all these proposals share the pleasant feature of being inspired in some way ; compelling , however , let alone without alternative in the sense of the present paper , appear few of these classes of theories . ]",
    "einstein ) need not be postulated , since they can be derived for any tensorial spacetime geometry , as we will show , by solving a a system of homogeneous linear partial differential equations .",
    "thus the question whether there is an alternative to general relativity as a classical gravity theory carries over in the formalism developed in the paper to a mathematical existence problem .",
    "now if such solutions exist at all , the question of whether there are other dynamics for the same geometry translates into the mathematical question of the uniqueness of such a solution . and",
    "finally , the problem of constructing concrete alternative gravity dynamics amounts to nothing less , but also nothing more , than finding an actual solution of the linear system of partial differential equations . in the philosophy of this paper , studying modified theories of gravity",
    "therefore amounts to studying solutions to the said equations .",
    "the organisation of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec_primer ] , we start by giving a concise review of tensorial spacetime geometries , culminating in the insight of how normal co - vectors to initial data surfaces are mapped to normal vectors , which is the pivotal technique in constructing the canonical dynamics for such geometries .",
    "this is then used in section [ sec_deformation ] to derive the deformation algebra of initial data surfaces in any tensorial spacetime geometry . since geometrodynamics must evolve geometric initial data from one initial data hypersurface to the next",
    ", gravitational dynamics must represent this deformation algebra on a geometric phase space , which we explain in section [ sec_canonical ] .",
    "chapters [ sec_ppgrav ] and [ sec_fieldgrav ] then deal with different incarnations of the same program ; the former derives the dynamics of dispersion relations independent of any underlying geometric tensor , while the latter deals with the more fundamental question of deriving dynamics for the fundamental geometric tensor . more specifically , the supermomentum for the dispersion relation geometry is constructed in section [ sec_supermomentum ] , while the corresponding superhamiltonian splits into a non - local part that we construct in section [ sec_nonlocal ] and a local part that is determined by equations that we derive in the course of sections [ sec_lagrangian ] , [ sec_reduction ] and [ sec_construction ] .",
    "section [ sec_firstderivative ] then derives further insight on the structure of the equations determining the local part of the superhamiltonian for dispersion relations , before we recover the dynamics for the dispersion relation of standard general relativity in section [ sec_gr ] , starting from nothing more than the dispersion relation of lowest possible degree , demonstrating that the general principles underlying our study of all spacetimes are none other than those also underlying general relativity .",
    "the construction of the supermomentum and superhamiltonian determining the dynamics of a fundamental geometric tensor field in chapter [ sec_fieldgrav ] proceeds very much along the same lines , but depends heavily on the algebraic structure of the fundamental geometric tensor one considers .",
    "building on some work recycleable from section [ sec_ppgrav ] , we derive the equations whose solution yields the dynamics for area metric manifolds as a prototypical example in section [ sec_candyn ] after having constructed the relevant geometric phase space in section [ sec_fieldphasespace ] .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "whether a tensor field can provide a spacetime structure depends on the matter one wishes to consider on it . in this chapter we will first review how three fundamental requirements one needs to ask of any realistic matter theory  predictivity , interpretability and quantizability  greatly restrict the tensor field backgrounds they can couple to . in particular , we will see that the dispersion relation associated with the entirety of field equations on a spacetime plays a prominent geometric role , and almost single - handedly encodes the kinematics associated with the underlying tensorial geometry .",
    "these insights , which are reviewed here in section [ sec_primer ] in a brief but self - contained manner for the benefit of the reader , are then used in section [ sec_deformation ] to study the deformation algebra of initial data hypersurfaces in tensorial spacetimes .",
    "the basic geometrodynamic idea , namely to use this deformation algebra to derive canonical dynamics , is then laid out in section [ sec_canonical ] and presents the key to constructing gravitational dynamics for the dispersion relation in chapter [ sec_ppgrav ] , or more fundamentally , the underlying tensorial geometry in chapter [ sec_fieldgrav ] .      in this section , we give a concise review of tensorial geometries that can serve as a spacetime structure . the technical proofs underlying this summary",
    "are presented in detail in @xcite and rather pedagogical fashion in the lecture notes @xcite . to aid the reader",
    "s intuition , we illustrate each abstract construction in this section immediately for the familiar example of a standard metric geometry , before moving on to the next construction . occasionally we will also contrast this to area metric geometry @xcite as a comparatively well - studied example for a non - metric tensorial geometry .",
    "having studied the general theory and these examples , the reader should be in a position to carry out a similar analysis for his or her favourite tensorial geometry .",
    "all we know about spacetime , we know from probing it with matter .",
    "so we consider , in addition to an a priori arbitrary tensor field @xmath1 ( the `` geometry '' ) on a smooth manifold @xmath2 also a field @xmath3 ( the `` matter '' ) , which takes values in some tensor representation space @xmath4 and whose gauge - fixed dynamics are encoded in linear field equations that transform as a tensor . since the only other structure on the manifold besides the matter field @xmath3",
    "is provided by the geometric tensor @xmath1 , the coefficients @xmath5 of the matter field equations ( after removing potential gauge symmetries and separating off the related constraint equations ) must be built entirely from the geometric tensor and its partial derivatives , of the latter , the coefficients @xmath5 of the linearized equation will generically depend also on @xmath6 @xmath7_{ab}^{a_1 \\dots a_n}(x ) \\partial_{a_1 } \\dots \\partial_{a_n } \\phi^b(x ) = 0\\,,\\ ] ] with small latin spacetime indices running from @xmath8 and capital latin respresentation space indices ranging over @xmath9 .",
    "it is straightforward to establish that in such an equation the leading order coefficient , and generically only this one , transforms as a tensor , if the entire equation does.$ ] with respect to the tensor field @xmath10note the corresponding position of the index @xmath11 in eqn .",
    "( [ mattereqn ] ) ] this will render definition ( [ principal ] ) below covariant . for the example of the geometry being given by an inverse metric tensor field ( @xmath12 with non - zero determinant everywhere ) and a scalar field @xmath3 ( @xmath13 ) obeying the massless klein gordon equation @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the christoffel symbols of the metric @xmath16 , we indeed find that the leading quadratic order coefficient transforms as a tensor , while the linear order coefficient does not ( and could not , since it must ensure that the enrire equation transforms as a scalar ) .    requiring that matter equations of the form ( [ mattereqn ] ) are predictive , interpretable and quantizable imposes necessary conditions on the underlying geometry @xmath1 .",
    "these conditions have been derived and explained in detail in @xcite .",
    "here we present a practical summary of these conditions and their implications as far as they are directly relevant for the present article .",
    "all constructions revolve around the totally symmetric contravariant tensor field @xmath17 defined from the leading order coefficients of the matter field equations ( [ mattereqn ] ) by @xmath18_{ab}^{a_1\\dots a_n}(x ) k{a_1 } \\dots k_{a_n}\\right)\\ ] ] for all points @xmath19 and cotangent vectors @xmath20 and a scalar density function @xmath21 constructed from the geometry @xmath1 such as to be of opposite density weight to the determinant over the tensor representation indices . to lighten the notation",
    ", we will often use the shorthand @xmath22 for the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ principal ] ) .",
    "furthermore we may agree , since no information is lost and it is technically convenient , to remove any repeated factors into which the field @xmath17 may factorize ; so if the above construction yields @xmath23 then we consider instead the reduced tensor field @xmath17 defined by @xmath24 . the physical meaning of the tensor field @xmath17 is revealed by the eikonal equation @xcite for the dynamics ( [ mattereqn ] ) , which shows that @xmath25 is the dispersion relation that a covector @xmath26 must satisfy in order to qualify as a massless momentum . for our simple example of a klein - gordon field on a metric geometry ,",
    "the determinant in ( [ principal ] ) is of weight zero , and for the choice @xmath27 we obtain @xmath28 , and one indeed recovers the familiar massless dispersion relation @xmath29 .",
    "an instructive non - metric example is provided by abelian gauge theory coupled to an inverse area metric tensor geometry @xcite , which is based on a fourth rank contravariant tensor field @xmath1 featuring the algebraic symmetries @xmath30 ; calculation of the principal polynomial ( after removing gauge - invariance , observing resulting constraints on initial conditions and re - covariantizing the expression ) one obtains @xcite in @xmath31 dimensions the totally symmetric tensor field @xmath32 of tensor rank @xmath33 , with some scalar density @xmath34 of weight @xmath35 constructed from @xmath1 . in four spacetime dimensions , for example ,",
    "where the area metric may be decomposed into a cyclic part @xmath36 with @xmath37}=0 $ ] and a totally antisymmetric part given in terms of a scalar density @xmath38 of weight @xmath39 , @xmath40 , one may chose @xmath41 .",
    "this non - trivial example for a field @xmath17 illustrates two salient points .",
    "first , it reveals what a dramatic accident it is that in lorentzian geometry the field @xmath17 , which will be central to all further developments , is essentially identical to the fundamental geometric field @xmath42 ; for in area metric geometry , one not only sees that @xmath17 is a tensor field of generically entirely different tensor rank than the underlying fundamental geometric tensor @xmath1 , but may also feature an entirely different index symmetry structure : the tensor @xmath17 is always totally symmetric .",
    "second , it exemplifies the rule that generically the fundamental geometry @xmath1 can not be reconstructed from the field @xmath17 .",
    "enter the field @xmath17 , see e.g. @xcite ] with these remarks on the role of the field @xmath17 as a dispersion relation and its origin in matter field equations coupled to some tensorial geometry , we are now prepared to lay down the three crucial algebraic conditions that the tensor field @xmath17 needs to satisfy .",
    "these conditions in turn restrict the geometric tensor @xmath1 that underlies @xmath17 .",
    "the first condition , predictivity of the matter field equations , translates into the algebraic requirement that the tensor field @xmath17 be hyperbolic @xcite .",
    "this means that there exists a covector field @xmath43 with @xmath44 such that for all covector fields @xmath45 there are only real functions @xmath46 on @xmath2 such that @xmath47 everywhere . obviously if @xmath48 , one could arrange for @xmath44 simply by changing the overall sign of the density @xmath21 appearing in ( [ principal ] ) , and we will agree to do so for definiteness . in the special case of metric geometry ] in any case , it is useful terminology to call a covector field @xmath43 , if it indeed exists , a hyperbolic covector field with respect to @xmath17 .",
    "only hypersurfaces whose canonical normal covector fields ( defined to annihilate any tangent vector field to the hypersurface ) are hyperbolic can serve as initial data surfaces for equations of the type ( [ mattereqn ] ) .",
    "we will return to this point later .",
    "for our example of a metric geometry , it is easy to check that @xmath49 is hyperbolic if and only if the inverse metric has lorentzian signature @xmath50 , and that the hyperbolic covectors are exactly those covectors for which @xmath51 ; in other words , initial data surfaces need to be spacelike . the reader be warned , however , that such a simple characterization of hyperbolic covectors and thus initial data surfaces merely by the sign of their co - normals or tangent vectors under @xmath17 is not generic and merely a coincidence in the metric case .",
    "the underlying general definitions however work for all geometries .",
    "the second condition , interpretability of the matter field equations translates into a time - orientability condition for the underlying geometry .",
    "this is simply the algebraic requirement that also the so - called dual tensor field @xmath52 be hyperbolic . indeed , for any hyperbolic tensor field @xmath17",
    ", one can show that there always exists a totally symmetric covariant dual tensor field @xmath52 of some rank @xmath53 such that @xmath54 for all covector fields @xmath55 with @xmath56 everywhere , where @xmath57 denotes the vector with components @xmath58 and we used a shorthand for the evaluation of the field @xmath52 on a vector that is analogous to the previous one for @xmath17 on a covector .",
    "the dual tensor field @xmath52 is unique up to a real conformal factor , and can always be constructed , essentially by determining a grbner basis @xcite .",
    "for our example of metric geometry , a dual of @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 , as one easily verifies .",
    "returning to the general case , time - orientability means that there exists a vector field @xmath61 such that for every vector field @xmath62 there are only real functions @xmath63 on @xmath2 such that @xmath64 everywhere .",
    "a vector field @xmath61 satisfying this condition will be called a time - orientation .",
    "once a time - orientation has been chosen , it is useful to consider , separately in each tangent space , the connected set @xmath65 of all hyperbolic vectors to which the vector @xmath66 of the time - orientation belongs .",
    "according to a classic theorem @xcite , @xmath65 constitutes an open and convex cone in the tangent space @xmath67 , and we will call @xmath65 the cone of observer tangents ( to observer worldlines through the point @xmath68 ) . note that in general , hyperbolicity of @xmath17 does not already imply hyperbolicity of @xmath52 , and thus predictivity",
    "does not imply time - orientability in general . for our metric example , however , it trivially does ; @xmath69 is hyperbolic if and only if @xmath49 is , and the cones @xmath70 of observer tangents are the timelike vectors @xmath71 at each point that are future - oriented with respect to some global timelike vector field @xmath72 representing the time - orientation , i.e. , satisfy @xmath73 ; again , this simple sign condition to decide membership of @xmath71 in the cone of observer tangents selected by @xmath72 is a coincidence in the metric case , and again has to be replaced by the underlying general definition above for other geometries .    the third condition on the matter field equations , namely that these are quantizable , is that the geometry be energy - distinguishing",
    "this simply means that all observers agree on the sign of the energy of a massless momentum .",
    "more precisely , a geometry is energy - distinguishing if for every point @xmath19 and every massless momentum @xmath55 either @xmath74 or @xmath75 for all @xmath76 . in a hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing geometry , one can then also meaningfully define _ massive _ particle momenta of positive energy at some point @xmath68 as those hyperbolic covectors @xmath77 for which @xmath78 for all observers @xmath76 . to be able to do",
    "this is of crucial importance when performing a split of a basis of solutions to the field equations into positive and negative frequency solutions in a canonical quantization of the matter field .",
    "these massive positive energy momenta constitute an open convex cone @xmath79 in the cotangent space at @xmath68 .",
    "the mass @xmath80 of such a positive energy massive particle momentum @xmath81 is then defined by @xmath82 in lorentzian metric geometry , the above definitions of course recover as the positive energy massive and massless momenta precisely those timelike and null covectors whose application to a future - directed timelike vector is positive .",
    "it may be worth emphasizing again that for a covector to qualify as massive , it must not only satisfy the massive dispersion relation ( [ massive ] ) but indeed be hyperbolic , as stipulated above . only in lorentzian geometry does the massive dispersion relation already imply hyperbolicity .",
    "only if a geometry satisfies the three conditions laid out above can one associate worldlines with the massless and massive dispersion relations . for",
    "only then can one solve for the momenta @xmath83 after variation of the hamiltonian actions @xmath84",

    "defining the legendre map @xmath85 for all covectors @xmath83 in the open convex cone @xmath79 of positive energy massive momenta at some point @xmath68 as @xmath86 which by virtue of the energy - orientability of @xmath17 possesses a unique inverse @xmath87 on its domain , one finds @xcite that the worldlines of free massless and massive particles are stationary curves of the reparametrization - invariant lagrangian actions",
    "@xmath88 = \\int d\\tau\\ , \\mu p^\\#(\\dot x ) \\qquad \\textrm { and } \\qquad s_\\textrm{massive}[x ] = m\\int d\\tau \\ , p(l^{-1}(\\dot x))^{-\\frac{1}{\\deg p}}\\,,\\ ] ] respectively .",
    "the massive particle action reveals the physical meaning of the legendre map @xmath89 , since one readily derives that the canonical momentum of a positive energy massive particle is related to the worldline tangent vector as @xmath90 if one chooses the proper time parametrisation @xmath91 along the worldline .",
    "put simply , the legendre map raises the index on a positive energy massive momentum , in one - to - one but non - linear fashion . for the example of lorentzian geometry",
    ", we find that under the familiar proper time parametrisation @xmath92 , the worldline tangent vector @xmath93 and the corresponding particle momentum @xmath83 of a particle of mass @xmath80 are related through @xmath94 .",
    "the massless and massive lagrangian actions for the free point particle on a lorentzian spacetime recover the standard textbook postulates .    of central importance for the aim of this article , namely to derive the dynamics of hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - orientable geometries , is the following insight .",
    "hypersurfaces that are potential carriers of initial data and at the same time accessible by observers are those whose co - normal at each point lie in the cone @xmath95 .",
    "this is because , on the one hand , the purely spatial directions seen by an observer with tangent vector @xmath96 are precisely those vectors annihilated by the covector @xmath97 . on the other hand ,",
    "the cone of these observer co - tangents can be shown to always lie within the cone @xmath98 of hyperbolic covectors for hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing geometries . in lorentzian geometry ,",
    "such inital data surfaces accessible to observers are simply the spacelike hypersurfaces .",
    "incidentally , only when @xmath95 does not only lie within @xmath98 , but entirely coincides with it , is the theory free of particles travelling faster than the speed of some light .",
    "the deformation of such observer - accessible initial data hypersurfaces , separately in normal and tangential directions , will be the topic of the next section . while a generic hypersurface directly gives rise to tangent directions , but merely normal co - directions , it is only the legendre map ( and thus the spacetime geometry ) that allows to associate a normal co - direction @xmath99 of a hypersurface with a corresponding normal direction @xmath100 if @xmath99 lies in @xmath95 . normalizing the latter by requiring @xmath101 corresponds to requiring that the normal direction be tangent to an observer worldline with proper time parametrization .",
    "thus the normal deformation of observer - accessible initial data hypersurfaces feels the spacetime geometry through the legendre map .",
    "it is this role of the legendre map that we will see to hold the key to the derivation of the gravitational dynamics for general tensorial spacetimes .",
    "the aim of this paper is to find dynamics that develop initial geometric data from one initial data hypersurface to another , such that sweeping out the spacetime manifold in this way one reconstructs a hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing dispersion relation everywhere . in this section",
    "we describe initial data hypersurfaces by their embedding maps and study how functionals of this embedding map change under normal and tangential deformations of the hypersurface .",
    "the functionals of interest later on will be the induced geometry seen by point particles in section [ sec_ppgrav ] or the induced geometry seen by fields in section [ sec_fieldgrav ] .",
    "the change of a generic functional of the embedding map can be expressed by a linear action of deformation operators on such functionals , and it is the commutation algebra of these deformation operators that we are after .",
    "more precisely , we consider a hypersurface @xmath102 defined by an embedding map @xmath103 of a smooth manifold @xmath104 with local coordinates @xmath105 into the smooth manifold @xmath2 with local coordinates @xmath106 ; here and in the remainder of this paper , latin ` spacetime ' indices run from @xmath107 to @xmath108 while greek ` hypersurface ' indices run from @xmath109 to @xmath108 . without additional structure ,",
    "the embedding defines at each point @xmath110 of the hypersurface @xmath108 spacetime vectors @xmath111 tangent to the hypersurface @xmath102 , which in turn define , up to scale , normal spacetime covectors @xmath112 as the annihilators of all tangent vectors , @xmath113 only if we restrict attention to initial data hypersurfaces whose data are accessible to observers , by requiring that the @xmath112 lie in the respective cones @xmath95 everywhere along the hypersurface @xmath102 , can we impose the normalization @xmath114 and thus obtain a unique spactime vector field @xmath115 representing the normal directions , rather than normal co - directions , away from the hypersurface .",
    "thus an accessible initial data hypersurface @xmath102 induces a complete spacetime tangent space basis @xmath116 at every of its points , and dual basis @xmath117 in cotangent space .",
    "we now consider deformations of the hypersurface @xmath102 .",
    "technically , this is done by prescribing a smooth one - parameter family @xmath118 of embedding maps such that the original embedding map @xmath71 is recovered for @xmath119 .",
    "then the connecting vector field @xmath120 in spacetime , between the hypersurfaces @xmath121 of this family , can be uniquely decomposed along the undeformed hypersurface into a sum of a purely spatial and a purely tangential part , @xmath122 where the hypersurface scalar field @xmath123 and hypersurface vector field components @xmath124 are given by @xmath125 and thus completely parametrize any small deformation of the embedding map @xmath71 into @xmath126 .",
    "the linear change of functionals under changes of the embedding map is conveniently studied in terms of normal and tangential deformation operators .",
    "more precisely , we define the normal deformation operator @xmath127 acting on arbitrary functionals @xmath128 of the embedding function . the change of such @xmath128 under the deformation ( [ deformation ] ) is then given to first order by @xmath129 .",
    "similarly one obtains for a purely tangential deformation the first order change @xmath130 through the tangential deformation operator @xmath131 a trivial check on the geometric meaning , which this terminology attaches to these operators , is their action on the components of the embedding map itself ; with the definitions of the delta distribution and functional derivatives one finds @xmath132 which indeed are precisely the normal and tangential components of the deformation ( [ deformation ] ) . since the embedding is a linear functional of itself , this shows that ( [ hoperator ] ) and ( [ doperator ] ) indeed are the operators that bring about the normal and tangential deformations of functionals to linear order , as desired .",
    "finally we may calculate their commutator algebra .",
    "the latter will play a crucial role througout this paper .",
    "now the basis vectors @xmath72 and @xmath133 are functionals of the embedding map , and it is thus clear that multiple application of deformation operators will require to know their functional derivatives with respect to the embedding functions .",
    "while for the hypersurface tangent vectors one obtains @xmath134 in straightforward fashion directly from their definition , one needs to work somewhat harder from the definition of @xmath72 to find @xmath135(y)\\delta_y(z),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where in the first summand one of the hypersurface tensors defined in ( [ hypgeo ] ) appears .",
    "note that the dispersion relation enters only in the variation of the normal vector , but not of the tangent vectors .",
    "this is because the definition of the former employs the legendre map defined by the dispersion relation .",
    "this is indeed the way the geometry enters into the deformation algebra , which is now straightforwardly calculated to be . in most standard texts on the hypersurface deformation algebra of lorentzian",

    "now that the supermomentum , and thus the right hand side of the bracket ( [ rephh ] ) is known , we can start to determine the superhamiltonian by extracting the information contained in this and the other remaining bracket ( [ repdh ] ) .",
    "the latter simply tells us that the superhamiltonian must be a scalar density of weight one . for on the one hand , we concluded from ( [ pond ] ) and ( [ ponpi ] ) that @xmath204 acts like a lie derivative on any functional of the geometric phase space variables , and thus on the superhamiltonian in particular .",
    "but on the other hand , letting @xmath205 in the bracket ( [ repdh ] ) we obtain @xmath206 after an integration by parts on the right hand side .",
    "but this is the lie derivative of @xmath156 only if the latter is a scalar density of weight one , as claimed , and this is all that follows from this second bracket .",

    "however , the simple form of the @xmath211 term allows to directly determine the non - local contribution of the momenta to the superhamiltonian .",

    "note that the non - local part @xmath217 of the superhamiltonian is the divergence of a vector density of weight one and thus a scalar density of the same weight .",
    "hence , the decomposition ( [ hdecomposition ] ) turns the superhamiltonian into the sum of two tensor densities of weight one @xcite .",
    "this means that we reduced the problem of finding the superhamiltonian as a functional of both phase space variables @xmath214 and @xmath218 to the much simpler problem , as it will turn out , of determining the local part that is a functional in @xmath214 but only a function in @xmath218 .",

    "since the hypersurface @xmath104 is of dimension three , it again follows that the coefficients depend on the second partial derivatives only up to the third power .",
    "the invariance equations following from the transformation properties of the weight - one densities @xmath360 ( or , fully equivalently , from the poisson bracket of the supermomentum with the superhamiltonian ) can be derived in straightforward fashion .",
    "the first invariance identity takes the form @xmath481 the second invariance equation reads @xmath482 the last invariance identity is even more complicated and we only display its contracted form : @xmath483 where @xmath99 is the difference of the total number of subscript indices and the total number of superscript indices in the coefficients @xmath360 .",
    "in this paper , we addressed the question of how to construct canonical gravitational dynamics for spacetime geometries beyond the lorentzian manifolds featuring in einstein s general relativity .",
    "the first step consisted in an analysis of what kind of tensor fields @xmath1 on a smooth manifold @xmath2 can serve as a spacetime geometry in the first place , dependent on the presence of specific matter field dynamics .",
    "indeed , the geometry must be such that all matter field equations are predictive , interpretable and quantizable .",
    "these conditions on the matter field dynamics impose three corresponding algebraic conditions on a totally symmetric tensor field @xmath17 , which is defined in terms of the fundamental geometric tensor field @xmath1 and whose precise form arises from the matter field dynamics : @xmath17 needs to be hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing , as reviewed in section [ sec_primer ] .",
    "so in order to start the whole machinery presented here , we first need to know which matter couples in which way to the tensorial geometry .",
    "we do not see this as a weakness of the formalism , but rather as an insight ; it was maxwell theory that justified einstein to promote lorentzian manifolds to the status of a spacetime geometry , and experimental observation of any matter that does not mimick the structure of maxwell theory ( non - half - integer spin or superluminal matter , for instance ) will force us to choose another tensorial geometry .",
    "but certainly one that is hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing . fortunately ,",
    "with the results of chapter [ sec_kinematics ] , we have all these geometries under excellent technical control .    directly from these purely kinematical insights , one can calculate the deformation algebra of hypersurfaces in any hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing geometry .",
    "this is the algebra of linear operators that describe how the geometry induced on a hypersurface changes when the hypersurface is deformed in normal and tangential directions .",
    "and gravitational dynamics is precisely about understanding these changes in the geometry on initial data surfaces , as has been clarified in seminal work of hojmann , kuchar and teitelboim for the special case of lorentzian manifolds , building on the canoncial formalism introduced by arnowitt , deser and misner .",
    "the most important result of chapter [ sec_kinematics ] , from a practical point of view , is therefore that one can calculate the deformation algebra of hypersurfaces in any hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing tensorial geometry .",
    "this is by no means trivial , since the existence and uniqueness of the way to associate normal directions along a hypersurface with its canonical normal co - directions by means of a legendre map requires all three algebraic properties : the hyperbolicity , time - orientability and energy - distinguishing property . despite appearances",
    ", this also applies to metric geometry ( where any one of these conditions is equivalent to the requirement of a lorentzian signature ) , since although , purely formally , one can still construct normal directions from normal co - directions for other signatures , they lose their physical meaning .",
    "canonical gravitational dynamics for the spatial geometry that are ultimately invariant under spacetime diffeomorphisms must be given by a pure constraint hamiltonian ( which is of course a functional of the geometric degrees of freedom and associated conjugate momenta on an initial data hypersurface ) composed of two separate first class constraints  corresponding to spatial diffeomorphism invariance within the hypersurface on the one hand , and invariance under diffeomorphisms away from the hypersurface on the other hand .",
    "the rle of the deformation algebra , in this geometrodynamic language , is that these constraints must satisfy canonical poisson bracket relations of the same form as the commutator algebra of the normal and tangential deformation operators on functionals of the hypersurface embedding map .",
    "the task is thus to determine the constraint functionals from this poisson algebra .",
    "this would be a mere representation theory problem if the poisson algebra were a lie algebra .",
    "but only two of the three bracket relations feature structure constants , and their impact on the form of the constraint functionals is thus readily established .",
    "the third poisson bracket relation , however , features a structure function that captures the impact of the particular hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing tensorial geometry to which one wishes to give dynamics . determining the implications of this bracket amounts , at first sight , to the truly daunting task of solving a system of non - linear functional - differential equations . the better part of chapters [ sec_ppgrav ] and [ sec_fieldgrav ] is thus devoted to reducing this to the equivalent , and principally manageable , problem of solving a system of homogeneous linear partial differential equations . and this set of equations already contains , by construction , all possible classical gravitational dynamics one can give to a tensorial spacetime geometry that can carry predictive , interpretable and quantizable matter fields .",
    "in the philosophy of this paper , the physical problem of finding diffeomorphism - invariant gravity theories alternative to einstein s general relativity is shown to be equivalent to the mere mathematical task of solving these linear partial differential equations .",
    "this casts important physical questions into precise mathematical form .",
    "the question whether there are any alternatives to general relativity turns into the problem of existence of solutions ; the question whether there is a choice between various dynamics for a given tensorial spacetime geometry translates into the question of their uniqueness ; and finally , the actual construction of all concrete gravitational dynamics amounts to nothing more , but also nothing less , than explicitly finding the exact solutions of these linear partial differential equations .",
    "the difference between the treatments in chapter [ sec_ppgrav ] and [ sec_fieldgrav ] is that only in the latter do we construct dynamics for the fundamental tensorial spacetime geometry @xmath1 to which also fields can couple , while in the former we give dynamics only to the totally symmetric tensor field @xmath17 seen by point particles . in the special case of lorentzian geometry ,",
    "the two points of view accidentally coincide , since the tensor field @xmath17 encodes precisely the same degrees of freedom as the fundamental lorentzian metric @xmath42 to which fields can couple .",
    "the key result of chapter [ sec_ppgrav ] is that there is at most a one - integer - family of essentially different gravity theories that differ in their prediction of particle trajectories , and we wrote down the complete set of equations for all these theories .",
    "so if one is interested in the motion of massive and massless point matter only , one can ignore which particular fundamental geometric structure underlies a hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing dispersion relation , and compare observational data with these phenomenological theories .",
    "in contrast , if one wishes to consider a full gravitational theory to which both point particles and fields can couple , one needs to construct these along the lines laid out in chapter [ sec_fieldgrav ] .",
    "the resulting theories are more fundamental , but this comes at the price that the equations yielding their dynamics depend more heavily on the specific type of tensor field @xmath1 and require the explicit specification of the predictive , interpretable and quantizable matter coupling to it .",
    "our derivation of the relevant equations for four - dimensional area metric geometry carrying general linear electrodynamics at the end of chapter [ sec_fieldgrav ] , however , shows that also this more fundamental programme can be executed .    the main open question is how to find solutions to the system of homogeneous linear partial differential equations in either case . but this will well be worth the effort , since solving these equations immediately allows to answer a string of pertinent physical questions in gravity theory .",
    "four questions of high relevance for a number of current research programmes are how to    * settle the issue of which modified dispersion relations are admissible , and how they are determined dynamically , in order to conduct a focused search for experimental signatures . *",
    "provide canonical dynamics to one s favourite candidate of a tensorial geometry without further assumptions , starting from matter dynamics coupling to this geometry .",
    ", a two - form potential @xmath426 and dilaton @xmath3 from a purely canonical point of view .",
    "] * free the evaluation of observational raw data from the confines of lorentzian geometry and einstein dynamics , in favour of the wider framework that includes all hyperbolic , time - orientable and energy - distinguishing tensorial geometries , which one is led to consider in the light of matter dynamics that would qualify as non - causal in lorentzian spacetime .",
