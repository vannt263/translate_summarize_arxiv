    "it is quite well known that the scattering amplitude describing the scattering of particles with a long - range interaction , such as the coulomb one , composed of a slowly varying amplitude and a possibly rapidly varying phase .",
    "this results in a quantal cross section which is devoid of oscillations and which exactly coincides with the corresponding classical cross section .",
    "the reason for this is understood semi - classically , in the sense that in the evaluation of the quantal amplitude using the stationary phase method , one finds only one dominant contribution .",
    "the absence of oscillations in the scattering of non - identical particles with long range interaction , is changed when dealing with identical particles as the scattering amplitude in this case has to be symmetrized ( bosons ) or anti - symmetrized ( fermions ) . in these cases",
    "one encounters rather strong oscillations in the cross section arising from the interference of the amplitude evaluated at an angle @xmath0 and the one at @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting , mott , cross section is oscillatory and can be used to assess the importance of other weaker interactions which may be present .",
    "this idea has been explored by several authors in the case of heavy - ion scattering , where the long range interaction is the coulomb one and the weaker interactions , can be long - ranged , such as multipole polarizability @xcite , relativistic effects @xcite , color van der waals force @xcite , or short - ranged , such as the nuclear interaction @xcite . in this contribution",
    "we demonstrate that the mott cross section in the absence of the weaker forces ( pure coulomb ) can become structureless at a certain value of the sommerfeld parameter @xcite .",
    "this surprising effect can be explored to pin down the properties of the short - range nuclear interaction at energies well below the coulomb barrier . in the next sections we give the details of our recent investigation @xcite .",
    "we consider the scattering of two charged particles ( nuclei ) with charges @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",

    "of all the heavy - ion systems which were considered , the best case for studying the ti was found to be the elastic scattering of two @xmath30he nuclei , for which the condition @xmath31 implies a center of mass energy of @xmath32= 0.397 mev , well below the height of the coulomb barrier , @xmath33 = 0.87 mev .",
    "this guarantees that , for all practical purposes , the scattering is purely coulomb .",

    "our calculation for a pure coulomb potential mott scattering predicts one flat region at @xmath39 0.4 mev .",

    "we may take this point as a third ti .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ti at the lowest energy , @xmath38 = 0.4 mev , is shifted by the nuclear interaction to @xmath38 = 0.5 mev , indicating a slightly smaller value of @xmath64 than @xmath65 .",
