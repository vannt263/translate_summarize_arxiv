    "a paradigm shift has been occurring in recent years in the observational study of the interstellar medium ( ism ) in the galaxy and in external galaxies , where the ism is now recognized as being of fundamental importance not only in the life cycle of stars but also in galactic evolution .",
    "the present understanding of the ism draws a dynamic and violent picture of the gas in the vast interstellar space , rather than a static one envisioned previously .",
    "recent observations with higher angular resolution have revealed the existence of dynamic and diverse gas structures in the galaxy that can not be explained by the traditional evolutionary cycle of the ism , requiring new insights toward a comprehensive understanding of the ism ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 , 2002 ; dickey 2001 ) .",
    "extreme activity of the ism is indicated by large - scale circular or arc - like structures ( up to a few kiloparsecs in scale ) called superbubbles or supershells , many of which were identified earlier by heiles ( 1979 , 1984 ) based on h 21-cm line surveys by weaver and williams ( 1973 ) and heiles and habing ( 1974 ) .",
    "kiss , mor , and tth ( 2004 ) later identified 145 large - scale loop- or arc - like structures in the 2nd galactic quadrant ( i.e.  for galactic longitudes @xmath5 ) on _ iras_-based far - infrared maps .",
    "recent results for the 1st , 3rd , and 4th galactic quadrants by knyves  ( 2007 ) increased the number of identified loops to 462 .",
    "similar objects are also found in nearby galaxies , including the local group spirals andromeda ( m31 ; brinks & bajaja 1986 ) and m33 ( deul & den hartog 1990 ) , local group irregulars including the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ; chu  1993 , 1995 ; kim  1998 , 1999 ) , the small magellanic cloud ( smc ; staveley - smith  1997 ; stanimirovi  1999 ) and ic  10 ( shostak & skillman 1989 ) , large spiral galaxies such as m101 ( kamphuis  1991 ) and ngc  891 ( howk & savage 1997 , 2000 ) , and dwarf galaxies such as m82 ( matsushita  2000 ; matsumoto  2001 ) , ic  2574 , ddo  47 ( walter & brinks 1999 , 2001 ) and holmberg  ii",

    "( 86mm,110mm)figure1.eps    the most widely accepted theory for the origin of superbubbles suggests that supernova explosions and strong stellar winds from ob associations in a galactic disk blow the surrounding gas up into the halo , carving out extensive cavities in the ism ( see tenorio - tagle & bodenheimer 1988 ) .",
    "superbubbles are therefore believed to play a vital role in disk - halo interactions , serving as a conduit for matter and energy from the disk into the halo in the form of galactic ",
    "fountains ( shapiro & field 1976 ) or  chimneys ( norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .    in the galaxy , only a small number of chimneys ( or also called ",
    "worms ) or fragmenting superbubbles / supershells ( on several hundred to one thousand parsec scales ) are known and well - studied : e.g. , the orion - eridanus superbubble ( cowie  1979 ; reynolds & ogden 1979 ; boumis  2001 ; welsh  2005 ) , the cygnus superbubble ( cash  1980 ) , the stockert chimney ( mller  1987 ; kundt & mller 1987 ; forbes 2000 ) , the aquila supershell ( maciejewski  1996 ) , the scutum supershell ( callaway  2000 ; savage  2001 ) , gsh  277 + 00 + 36 ( mcclure - griffiths  2000 ) , gsh  242 - 03 + 37 ( mcclure - griffiths  2006 ) , the w4 chimney / superbubble ( normandeau  1996 ; reynolds  2001 ; terebey  2003 ; madsen  2006 ; west  2007 ) , the ophiuchus superbubble ( pidopryhora  2007 ) , and the ngc  281 superbubble ( megeath  2002 , 2003 ; sato  2007 ) .",
    "superbubbles are also a key target of research for understanding their impact on the history of star formation in the galactic disk , including but not limited to superbubble - triggered star formation ( e.g. , ngc  281 as explained later in the section ) .    in either the galaxy or external galaxies ,",
    "very little is known about the dynamics and energetics of superbubbles / chimneys or about their influence on the formation of the halo or on the star formation history in the galactic disk .",
    "a difficulty in revealing the structure and kinematics of superbubbles stems from the limited information obtainable from two dimensions of sky positions and velocity information only along the line of sight .",
    "a direct observation of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) motion and structure of a superbubble has not been easy due to the high astrometric accuracy required . however ,",
    "sato  ( 2007 ) reported the first vlbi ( very long baseline interferometry ) observations that obtained direct evidence for expanding motions of a superbubble by measuring the proper motions .    in sato  ( 2007 ) , we observed the h@xmath0o maser emission in ngc  281  west over 6 months with vera ( vlbi exploration of radio astrometry ) , a new japanese radio telescope array dedicated to phase - referencing vlbi astrometry ( e.g. , honma  2000 , 2005 , 2007 ; kobayashi  2003 ; imai  2006 , 2007 ; hirota  2007 , 2008a , 2008b ; nakagawa  2008 ; kim  2008 ; choi  2008 ) .",
    "these observations revealed the systemic motion of the ngc  281 superbubble away from the galactic plane at a velocity of 20@xmath630  km  s@xmath4 . at its",
    "estimated heliocentric distance of 2.2@xmath63.5  kpc , ngc  281 most likely originated in the galactic plane and has been blown out by a superbubble expansion ( see @xmath71.1 and sato  2007 ) .",
    "a precise and direct determination of the distance to ngc  281 is desirable and essential for a better understanding of the region , including further description of the 3d structure and motion of the superbubble to reveal the origin , the energetics and the timescale of the superbubble .",
    "these are the primary reasons why we decided to complete our vera observations to directly measure the parallactic distance to ngc  281 via an h@xmath0o maser source .",
    "the astrometric determination of the distance to ngc  281 is also important for studying early - type ( o@xmath6b ) high - mass ( @xmath8 ) stars and stellar evolution in combination and in comparison with photometric studies of the ob stars in ngc  281 ( e.g. , henning  1994 ; guetter & turner 1997 ) . in this paper , we present the results of our parallax measurements with vera over 18 months , which enables us to further discuss the 3d structure , expanding motion , the origin and the timescale of the ngc  281 superbubble .",

    "is remarkably located far above ( @xmath16  pc ) the midplane of the perseus arm of the galaxy .",
    "of special interest in the ngc  281 region is a possibility of triggered star formation occurring on two different scales : large - scale ( @xmath2300  pc ) supperbubble - triggered formation of the first ob stars ( megeath  2002 , 2003 ) , and the sequential and ongoing triggered star formation ( @xmath21@xmath610  pc ) in an adjoining giant molecular cloud ( ngc  281  west ) through interaction with an h region ( the ngc  281 nebula ) excited by the first ob stars ( elmegreen & lada 1978 ; megeath & wilson 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : optical ] is an optical image of the region , which clearly shows the red nebulosity of the h region ngc  281 ( also known as sharpless 184 ) of diameter 20  arcmin ( @xmath17  pc ) , in which an early - type cluster called ic  1590 is embedded ( guetter & turner 1997 ) . the brightest member of the cluster ic  1590 is an o - type trapezium - like system hd  5005 ( or also called ads  719 ) , whose component stars hd  5005ab ( unresolved ) , hd  5005c , and hd  5005d have spectral types of o6.5  v , o8  v , and o9  v , respectively ( walborn 1973 ; abt 1986 ; guetter & turner 1997 ) .    the southwestern quadrant of the ngc  281 nebula is obscured ( as seen in figure  [ fig : optical ] ) by the adjoining molecular cloud ngc  281  west in front of the nebula .",
    "ongoing star formation in the ngc  281  west cloud is indicated by the h@xmath0o maser emission and _ iras _ sources within this cloud near the clumpy interface between the h region and the cloud .",
    "this generation of stars may have been triggered by interactions with the h region ( elmegreen & lada 1978 ; megeath & wilson 1997 ) . the ngc  281 molecular cloud complex that surrounds the h region ( including the ngc  281  west and east clouds ) was mapped in co emission lines by lee and jung ( 2003 ) .",
    "the central radial velocity of the ngc  281  west molecular cloud , @xmath18  km  s@xmath4 ( lee and jung 2003 ) , agrees well with that of the h@xmath0o maser emission in the cloud ( sato  2007 ) . on a larger scale , megeath  ( 2002 , 2003 )",
    "identified the co molecular cloud complex as being on an h loop extending over 300  pc away from the galactic plane toward decreasing galactic latitude . in an @xmath19 vs.  @xmath20 diagram",
    "( i.e.  a plot of galactic longitude vs.  observed radial velocity ) , the co molecular clouds appear to be part of a broken ring of diameter 270  pc , expanding at a velocity of 22  km  s@xmath4 parallel to the galactic plane ( megeath  2002 , 2003 ) .",
    "megeath  ( 2002 , 2003 ) suggested that these clouds were formed in a fragmenting superbubble , which triggered the formation of the first ob stars , and that these ob stars then ionized the surrounding gas which subsequently triggered ongoing star formation in the neighboring cloud .    in sato  ( 2007 ) , we derived the absolute proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser features in ngc  281  west by phase - referencing vlbi observations with vera over 6 months .",
    "we found 10 maser features , highly likely excited by two spatially distinct young stellar objects ( ysos ) , are systematically moving toward southwest , in agreement with the direction of the proper motion of hd  5005 in the h region measured with larger uncertainties by _ hipparcos _ ( perryman  1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "our results with vera revealed the systemic motion of the ngc  281 region away from the galactic plane , most likely having originated in the galactic plane and been blown out by the expansion of the ngc  281 fragmenting superbubble .",
    "the uncertainties in our velocity estimates are largely due to the large distance uncertainty of ngc  281 , despite many measurements , e.g. , photometric distances of 2  kpc ( sharpless 1952 , 1954 ) , 3.68  kpc ( cruz - gonzlez  1974 ) , 3.5  kpc ( henning  1994 ) and 2.94@xmath10.15  kpc ( guetter & turner 1997 ) and kinematic distances of 2.2  kpc ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ; roger & pedlar 1981 ) and 3  kpc ( lee & jung 2003 ) . in sato  ( 2007 ) , we adopted a value of 2.9  kpc as the distance to ngc  281 , based on a recent estimate of 2.94@xmath10.15  kpc derived by guetter and turner ( 1997 ) through photometry of 279 individual stars in and about the young cluster ic  1590 embedded in the ngc  281 nebula .    the most reliable and direct way to determine",

    "the astrometric determination of the distance to ngc  281 provides valuable information for studying the formation and evolution of early - type ( o@xmath6b ) high - mass ( @xmath8 ) stars in comparison with photometric studies and distances , for example , by guetter & turner ( 1997 ) .    in the present study",

    "we first discuss possible error sources in our parallax and proper - motion measurements .    as already mentioned in @xmath79 , the true uncertainties in the measurements",
    "were estimated from standard deviations of the post - fit residual from the least - squares fits ( as listed in table  1 ) , because thermal errors due to noise in individual position measurements ( @xmath58  mas ) are far smaller than the deviations from the fits .",
    "the likely sources for such deviations are difficult to measure quantitatively , which led to our error underestimate in the derived absolute proper motions of feature  4 in sato  ( 2007 ) as described in @xmath80 .",
    "the reference sources did not show any resolved structure such as additional components or structural change , and we obtained similar results .",
    "therefore we do not consider the contribution of the reference source as a dominant error source .",
    "one of the likely causes for position uncertainties of @xmath56  mas and @xmath57  mas ( see table  1 ) is mis - modeling of tropospheric zenith delay , as also reported in previous astrometric measurements with vera ( e.g. , hirota  2007 ; nakagawa  2008 ; honma  2008b ) .",
    "the water vapor in the troposphere introduces optical path differences through the atmosphere between the target maser source and reference sources because of the elevation angle difference between the sources .",
    "therefore , even after the phase referencing calibration , there remain residuals of tropospheric zenith delay due to the water vapor , which are difficult to measure precisely and are one of the most serious error sources in the vlbi astrometry in the 22-ghz band . nakagawa  ( 2008 ) and honma , tamura & reid ( 2008b ) give detailed discussion on astrometric errors caused by such residuals of tropospheric zenith delay calibration with vera and report probable errors , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , of 0.05-mas and 0.10-mas levels , respectively , for source declination of 60@xmath13 .",
    "our parallax determination with vera is no exception in having astrometric errors larger in declination ( @xmath42 ) than in right ascension ( @xmath41 ) ( i.e.  @xmath81 ) as the same tendencies reported in other observations with vera ( e.g. , hirota  2007 ) .",
    "larger errors in @xmath42 ( dec ) than in @xmath41 ( ra ) are explained by the tendency of tropospheric zenith delay errors to have more severe effects in the @xmath42 direction ( although depending of the separation angle between the target and reference sources and the declination of the sources ) and are as expected by the simulation in honma , tamura and reid ( 2008b ) .",
    "however , we do not consider the residuals of tropospheric zenith delay as the dominant cause of errors in our parallax measurements . as the simulations by honma , tamura and reid ( 2008b ) clearly show , the astrometric errors due to the zenith delay residuals for the ngc  281 case at its high declination ( @xmath8256@xmath13.5 ) and with separation angle ( sa ) smaller than 1@xmath13 for j0047 + 5206 ( sa=0@xmath13.84 ) are expected to be as good as @xmath83  @xmath84as ( i.e.  @xmath85  mas ) in each of @xmath41 and @xmath42 directions , which do not account for all the standard deviations @xmath56  mas and @xmath57  mas in our measurements",
    ". also , as figure  [ fig : parallax ] clearly demonstrates , using two different reference quasars with different separation angles ( sa=0@xmath13.84 for j0047 + 5206 and sa=1@xmath13.50 for j0042 + 5708 ) did not result in remarkable differences in the astrometric errors for the two cases . this certainly excludes the simple zenith delay error effect as the main source of our astrometric errors .",
    "the most likely major source of errors in the present position measurements is a variation of the intrinsic maser structure .",
    "most maser spots are unresolved in vlbi observations , however evidence has been shown for intrinsic maser structure smaller than 1  au on submilliarcsecond scales in previous maser studies ( e.g. , fish & sjouwerman 2007 ) . a maser spot",
    "likely consists of both unresolved substructure and observed larger structure which are indistinguishable ( e.g. , fish & sjouwerman 2007 ) , and thus a variation in maser substructure can lead to fluctuation of the peak position , limiting the accuracy in position measurements of a maser spot .",
    "this effect of the maser spatial structure is also seen for other observations in parallax measurements with up to 10% errors , independently of the source distance , for example , in orion kl by hirota  ( 2007 ) .",
    "errors due to the maser structure can be reduced by using multiple maser features for derivation of a parallax . in our case of ngc  281  west , however , only one bright maser feature ( above 10  jy  beam@xmath4 ) that was used in the present study was found with a good signal - to - noise ratio for the precise parallax measurements , even persistent for the all observation epochs .    according to discussions by honma  ( 2007 ) , other possible astrometric errors in vera observations that arise from the uncertainties in the antenna - station positions , delay models , and path length differences due to ionosphere are smaller by at least an order of magnitude than the uncertainties due to tropospheric zenith delay residuals .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the main error sources of our astrometric measurements is the variability of maser feature structure , and the contribution by tropospheric zenith delay residuals is also nonnegligible .",

    "this is contrary to expectation , i.e.  one would expect a superbubble to expand and blowout in the @xmath187 direction with a vertical density gradient and with a long timescale of @xmath189  myr ( see e.g. , tomisaka & ikeuchi 1986 and mac  low  1989 for superbubble models with vertical density stratifaction ) .",
    "it is thus indicated that the expansion of the ngc  281 superbubble is confined to the galactic disk .",
    "this may be explained by tomisaka ( 1998 ) s 3-dimensional mhd simulations which show that the superbubble expansion can be confined to the disk by the magnetic field of the disk , and our estimated 3d structure of the ngc  281 superbubble shows a very analogous shape , size and timescale to those of model  a ( size @xmath190  pc perpendicular to the plane , timescale @xmath191myr ) of tomisaka ( 1998 ) , which assumes a uniform density of the ism , @xmath192  @xmath193 and a uniform magnetic field , @xmath194 g , aligned to one direction within and along the disk .",
    "therefore , the shape of the ngc  281 superbubble sugessts that the superbubble expansion may be confined to the disk due to the magnetic field of the disk .    within the disk , the tomisaka ( 1998 ) model predicts the elongation of the superbubble to be along the direction of the magnetic field of the disk , which could be in disagreement with the ngc  281 case if the magnetic field lies along the perseus spiral arm ( e.g. , han  2006 ) .",
    "the density decrease of the perseus spiral arm might be also responsible for the structure formation at the position and heliocentric distance of ngc  281 , thus yielding a possible implication on the width of the perseus spiral arm .",
    "the further details of the 3d structure of the ngc  281 superbubble and its relation to the perseus arm should be revealed by future parallax measurements with vera of multiple maser sources in the superbubble .",
    "( 160mm,150mm)figure5.eps    our astrometric determination of the distance to ngc  281 also provides important information toward better understanding of early - type ( o@xmath6b ) high - mass ( @xmath8 ) stars and stellar evolution in combination with photometric studies of the ob stars in ngc  281 ( e.g. , henning  1994 ; guetter & turner 1997 ) .    in the 1990s , the _ hipparcos _ astrometry satellite measured the trigonometric parallaxes of more than 100  000 stars in the solar neighborhood with a precision of about 1  mas , including direct distance estimates of 20  853 stars with a precision better than 10 percent and of 49  399 stars ( in total ) with a precision better than 20 percent ( perryman  1995 , 1997 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] is the h - r ( hertzsprung - russell ) diagram or the color - absolute magnitude diagram based on the _ hipparcos _ data of stars ( shown as black dots ) with parallactic distances determined with precisions better than 10% .",
    "the achievements of _ hipparcos _ marked a significant milestone in the history of astronomy and brought a new era of astrometry , since before _",
    ", parallax measurements were limited to the nearest stars and thus direct distance estimates of only several hundred nearby stars were known with precisions better than 20 percent .",
    "nevertheless , the parallax measurements by _ hipparcos _ were restricted only to within a few hundred parsecs from the sun , which is much smaller than the size of the galaxy ( e.g. , @xmath215  kpc in disk radius ) .    due to the low local space density of ob stars",
    ", there is a lack of early - type high - mass stars with absolute magnitudes reliably derived from astrometrically measured distances , as seen on the left side ( i.e.  the high - mass end ) of figure  [ fig : hr ] .",
    "alternatively , most of the distances and thus absolute magnitudes of ob stars are estimated by a comparison of photometric colors and magnitudes with an empirical standard of zero - age main sequence ( zams ) stars in the color - magnitude diagram , derived from other well - studied objects such as hyades ( see anthony - twarog 1982 ) . such zams comparisons assume compositional differences in clusters can be ignored , however , the metalicity dependence of zams stars is important when used as distance scale and is the cause of difficulty in a direct comparison between theoretical models and empirical zams curves ( e.g. , anthony - twarog 1982 ; zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) . therefore , precise and direct determination of distances , and thus absolute magnitudes , are desired and essential for further studies of stellar evolution sensitivity to metalicity .",
    "as mentioned earlier , extremely high astrometric accuracy can now be achieved with vlbi techniques out to as kiloparsec distances with precisions better than 10 percent ( e.g. , xu  2006 ; hachisuka  2006 ; menten  2007 ) . in particular , recent results of parallax measurements with vera are reported in hirota  ( 2007 , 2008a , 2008b ) , honma  ( 2007 ) , nakagawa  ( 2008 ) , kim  ( 2008 ) , and choi  ( 2008 ) , clearly demonstrating vera s high capability for the galaxy - scale astrometry .    using our new distance determination of ngc  281 by parallax measurements with vera , @xmath195  kpc , to derive absolute magnitudes ,",
    "we have plotted the photometric data of zams of early - type stars in ngc  281 by guetter & turner ( 1997 ) in figure  [ fig : hr ] as red dots , which give improved coverage of the high - mass end of the h - r diagram . in figure",
    "[ fig : hr ] , the empirical zams curves are also plotted for reference : turner ( 1976 ) in blue ; blaauw ( 1963 ) in pink ; and schmidt - kaler ( 1982 ) in green ( dashed ) .",
    "orange dotted ( lower ) and dashed ( upper ) curves in figure  [ fig : hr ] show zams curves that would yield distances of ngc  281 to be 2.2  kpc and 3.5  kpc ( i.e.  the distance discrepancy of ngc  281 from previous studies ) , made by additionally shifting the zams by turner ( 1976 ) , from which guetter & turner ( 1997 ) obtained a photometric distance to ngc  281 of 2.94  kpc .",
    "figure  [ fig : hr ] clearly shows the ngc  281 data agree well with the empirical zams curves , and that resolving the large distance discrepancy of ngc  281 from previous studies was important .",
    "the agreement of the parallactic distance with the photometric distance is important for confirming the accuracy of the correction for extinction or reddening in photometric studies such as guetter & turner ( 1997 ) and for enhancing the precision of the h - r diagram .",
    "our determination of the parallactic distance to ngc  281 therefore contributes to the extension of the h - r diagram for the study of high - mass stars and , furthermore , opens up new possibilities of using the h - r diagram with parallax measurements for galaxy - scale studies , for example , investigating the formation of the galaxy via the difference in the h - r diagram for components such as the bulge and spiral arms .",
    "further contributions are expected with the vlbi techniques and with vera for direct parallax determination far beyond the solar neighborhood toward a comprehensive understanding of the galaxy .",
    "in this paper , we have presented the results of our multi - epoch phase - referencing observations with vera over 18 months of an h@xmath0o maser source in the galactic star - forming region ngc  281  west , associated with a fragmenting superbubble @xmath196  pc above the perseus spiral arm .",
    "the primary results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we detected a trigonometric parallax of 0.355@xmath10.030  mas , corresponding to a distance of 2.82@xmath10.24  kpc to ngc  281 .",
    "our parallactic distance agrees well with the photometric distance of 2.94@xmath10.15  kpc derived by guetter & turner ( 1997 ) , allowing for improved study of the absolute magnitutudes of high - mass ob stars , and resolved the large distance discrepancy of ngc  281 from previous photometric and kinematic studies .",
    "we revised the absolute proper motions of the h@xmath0o maser features measured in sato  ( 2007 ) , and using our new determination of the parallactic distance , we derived more precisely the velocity component of the ngc  281 region @xmath197  km  s@xmath4 perpendicular to the galactic plane .",
    "this yields a timescale of @xmath182  myr and kinectic energy of the region to be @xmath134  ergs in the direction perpendicular to the plane .",
    "we demonstrated the 3d structure and expansion of the ngc  281 superbubbles in comparison of our parallactic distance to ngc  281 with the parallactic distance derived by moellenbrock  ( 2007 ) for another h@xmath0o maser source , iras  00420 + 5530 in the superbubble .",
    "our new parallactic distance revealed the structure of the superbubble @xmath2650 pc in size parallel to the galactic disk and with a shape slightly elongated along the disk or spherical , but not vertically elongated in the @xmath187 direction .",
    "therefore , the superbubble expansion may be confined to the disk , possibly due to the magnetic field of the disk .",
    "we suggested a new possible interpretation of an expanding molecular ring parallel to the galactic plane in the longitude - velocity diagram by megeath  ( 2002 , 2003 ) . in either interpretation , the ring center , i.e.  the likely origin of the superbubble lies at @xmath118 .",
    "the velocity deviation of the superbubble from the galactic rotation is estimated to be @xmath183  km  s@xmath4 inward the galactic rotation and toward the sun from our proper motion measurements and from the longitude - velocity diagram , which might be due to velocity jumps over a spiral shock in the perseus spiral arm .",
    "we also estimated the velocity component and timescale of the ring expansion to be @xmath198  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath199  myr , respectively , parallel to the galactic plane , which are in good agreement with those independently estimated for the direction perpendicular to the galactic plane , @xmath197  km  s@xmath4 and @xmath182  myr .",
    "the kinetic energy estimate of the region parallel to the plane is @xmath148  ergs , and the total kinetic energy of both perpendicular and parallel to the plane is then estimated to be @xmath149  ergs , requiring multiple supernovae .    we are deeply grateful to the referee dr .",
