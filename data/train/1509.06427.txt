    "the critical temperature required to observe the qah effect is proportional to the mobility gap defined as @xmath150 , which must be positive . in order to increase the topological gap @xmath149 , it is important to have a large rashba soc @xmath151 , which is small @xmath152 mev in our calculations .",
    "the rashba spin - orbit coupling can in principle be enhanced by hydrogenation or deposition of heavy adatoms on the graphene surface@xcite .",
    "alternatively , the spin orbit coupling can also be enhanced by creating hetero - structures consisting of transition metal dichalcogenides ( tmds ) which possess a large spin - orbit coupling ( e.g. tmd / graphene / euo)@xcite . even for negative values of the mobility gap ( @xmath153 ) , the graphene / ferromagnetic structures will exhibit an unquantized anomalous hall effect .",
    "however , in this case the anomalous hall effect will be additionally influenced by disorder induced extrinsic effects @xcite like side - jump and skew scattering mechanisms which are beyond the scope of this study .    _",
