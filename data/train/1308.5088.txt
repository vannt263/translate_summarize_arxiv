    "@xcite relates a weakly coupled gravity in ads space to a strongly coupled cft in a lower dimension . on of the active arenas of its applications",
    "is condensed matter physics . in recent years , some important progresses have been made in this area .",
    "for example , some gravitational dual models of superfluid / superconductor  @xcite , ( non-)fermi liquid  @xcite , and josephson junctions  @xcite have been constructed and intensively studied . for recent reviews",
    ", please refer to @xcite .    as an important practical application of superconductivity , superconducting quantum interference device ( squid )",
    "@xcite can detect extremely weak magnetic field strength .",
    "the squid is a superconducting ring in which there are two josephson junctions  @xcite sitting on two sides of the ring .",
    "a schematic cartoon of the squid ring is plotted on the left panel of fig.[mu ] .",
    "these two josephson junctions will interfere with each other , and then the total current @xmath0 will depend on the phase differences of the two junctions .",
    "furthermore , the net difference of the two phase differences is proportional to the magnetic flux @xmath1 through the squid ring .",
    "the relation between the total current and the magnetic flux is  @xcite [ j1j2 ] j_total&=&j_1c(_1)+j_2c(_2 ) + & = & 2j_1c ( ) ( ) , where @xmath2 is assumed and they are the maximal currents of two josephson junctions ; @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the phase differences of junction 1 and 2 , while @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is an integer , and can be referred to as the fluxoid number  @xcite ) .",
    "the magnetic flux @xmath1 can be obtained through the integration of the gauge field along the ring .",
    "see also @xcite for the relation between @xmath1 and the integration of gauge field along a compactified direction in a holographic setup .",
    "( left . ) a schematic cartoon of the squid in condensed matter physics .",
    "@xmath1 is the magnetic flux through the ring .",
    "the black parts @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the two junctions 1 and 2 , respectively ; ( right . ) the chemical potential @xmath10 along the squid ring .",
    "the number @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent the junction @xmath11 and junction @xmath12 in the left panel , respectively . ]    in this paper , we will construct a holographic model of the squid ring by putting it in a compactified spatial direction @xmath13 on the boundary of a schwarzschild - ads black brane . we will choose a specific type of chemical potential which can model the superconductor - normal metal - superconductor ( sns ) josephson junction on two sides of the ring , please refer to the right panel of fig.[mu ] . instead of obtaining the usual relation in condensed matter physics",
    ", we actually get a more general form for the sake of the numerical calculation convenience .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in sec.[sect : model ] , we construct the model in a schwarzschild - ads black brane with a specific chemical potential ; numerical results are shown in sec.[sect : num ] ; finally , we draw the conclusions and discussions in sec.[sect : con ] .",
    "the matter sector of the model is described by the maxwell - complex scalar theory as s = d^4x(-14 f_f^-|-ia|^2-m^2||^2 ) , where @xmath14 is the u(1 ) gauge field while @xmath15 is the field strength .",
    "we will work in the probe limit , namely the back reaction of matter fields on the background geometry will be neglected .",
    "the gravitational background is a @xmath16-dimensional schwarzschild - ads black brane given by ( we have scaled the ads radius @xmath17 ) [ metric ] ds^2=-f(r)dt^2+dr^2+r^2(dx^2+d^2 ) . where @xmath18 with @xmath19 the horizon radius of the black brane .",
    "the temperature of the black brane is @xmath20 .",
    "the direction @xmath13 is compactified with the periodicity @xmath21 in which @xmath22 is the radius of the @xmath13-loop .",
    "the gravitational background is thermodynamically favored when @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "therefore in the following we will set @xmath24 , which satisfies the above condition .",
    "it is convenient for us to choose a gauge for the matter fields as = ||e^i , a_=(a_t ,  a_r ,  0 ,  a _ ) , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are all real functions of @xmath27 and @xmath13 . in the following context",
    "we will work with the gauge - invariant quantity @xmath28 .",
    "the equations of motion ( eoms ) of the matter sector in the background ( [ metric ] ) are    @xmath29    where @xmath30 .",
    "the above equations are not independent , in particular , one has @xmath31 .",
    "therefore , there are four independent eoms for four fields , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    at the horizon @xmath34 , the fields @xmath35 should be vanishing @xmath36 in order to make @xmath37 regular there , because @xmath38 is divergent at the horizon .",
    "other fields should be finite at the horizon .    at the ads",
    "boundary @xmath39 , the asymptotic behaviors of the fields are of the forms ||(r,)&~&++ , + m_t(r,)&~&()-+ , + m_r(r,)&~ & + , + [ myexpansion]m_(r,)&~&()++ . from the ads",
    "/ cft dictionary @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 can be regarded as the source and vacuum expectation value of the corresponding operator @xmath42 dual to the scalar field @xmath43 .",
    "we here turn off the source term and therefore impose @xmath44 in the following numerical calculations because we require the u(1 ) symmetry to be spontaneously broken ; @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the chemical potential and charge density of the dual field theory , respectively ; while @xmath47 and @xmath48 can be interpreted as the superfluid velocity and current of the dual field theory .. therefore , if we set @xmath49 at the boundary , it is easy to infer that @xmath50 should be a constant which is similar to the case in the literatures @xcite . ]    note that in the homogeneous case , _",
    "i.e. _ , all the fields are independent of the coordinate @xmath13 , the critical chemical potential at the superconductor / normal metal phase transition is @xmath51 for @xmath52  @xcite , and that a higher chemical potential corresponds to a lower temperature , and _",
    "vice versa_. thus in the numerical calculations we can tune the chemical potential while fixing the temperature  @xcite ; this is equivalent to tune the temperature while fixing the chemical potential . in our numerical calculations",
    "we will set the chemical potential on the boundary as [ chem ] ( ) & = & h-_i=1,2d_i , in which @xmath53 stand for the junctions in the squid ring ( see fig.[mu ] ) , and @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are related to the highest value , depth , slope , position , and width of the junction @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "please see the right panel of fig.[mu ] for a typical chemical potential in our model , we have set that only the depths of the two junctions are distinct . in this plot , the parameters we choose are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "we can see from fig.[mu ] that the higher parts of the chemical potential are greater than @xmath62 , therefore , these parts correspond to the superconductors , while the lower parts corresponding to the normal metals are smaller than @xmath62 . therefore , when applying this chemical potential on the compactified @xmath13-loop , we can realize the holographic model of a squid on the boundary .",
    "in the numerical calculations , we have scaled ||,m_r . for numerical convenience .",
    "in addition , it is convenient to work in the @xmath63-coordinates , thus , @xmath64 now is the ads boundary and @xmath65 is the horizon .",
    "we will work in the case with @xmath52 .",
    "the numerical methods we adopted are the combination with the chebyshev spectral method and the newton - raphson method @xcite .    as shown in fig.[mu ] , @xmath66 is the current flowing through the lower junction ( @xmath67 ) , while @xmath68 is the current flowing through the upper one ( @xmath69 ) . following @xcite , we can solve the equations of motion - along the the lower junction and upper junction , viewing @xmath66 and @xmath68 as input parameters , respectively .",
    "however , to model a squid , we need to set @xmath70 in order to make the scalar field @xmath43 be continuous at the two ends of the lower and upper junctions , _",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the continuity of the scalar field at the two ends is crucial in deriving the formula in condensed matter physics  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the numerical calculations we set the supercurrent @xmath73 as the input parameter and impose the continuous conditions for @xmath43 at the two ends . of course , it is not necessary to impose the continuous conditions for other fields , such as @xmath35 , @xmath74 and @xmath33 , at the two ends .",
    "but , in practice these gauge fields are also continuous at the two ends because of the input parameters @xmath70 and the continuity of chemical potential we choose at the two ends . in the numerical calculations it is helpful to note that there is a symmetry in the equations of motion - , m_-m _ , m_r - m_r , m_tm_t , |||| .",
    "we now define the gauge - invariant phase difference for the junction 1 and 2 as [ gamma12 ] _ 1&=&-^0_-(()-(0))d , + [ gamma122]_2&=&-_^0((0)-())d , respectively , which are similar to the one in ref .",
    "but in the definition of @xmath4 we have added an extra minus .",
    "this is due to the fact that in the numerical calculations ( see fig.[fields ] ) the integration from @xmath75 to @xmath76 will contribute an extra minus sign . as a result ,",
    "the extra minus sign in the definition of @xmath4 can cancel the effect of the minus sign coming from the numerical integration . in this way one can obtain the correct phase difference for the upper josephson junction .",
    "thus we can model a squid in which the total current flows into from @xmath77 and flows out from @xmath78 rather than a circuit current flowing around the loop .",
    ", which can be exactly obtained from eq . and",
    "eq .. ] so the total current flowing out from @xmath78 is @xmath79 .",
    "we plot the profiles of the fields @xmath80 and @xmath81 in fig.[fields ] with @xmath82 .",
    "next we will get the numerical results between the total current @xmath0 and the magnetic flux @xmath1 . in condensed matter physics  @xcite ,",
    "usually one demands that the maximal currents of the junctions on both sides are identical , namely , @xmath2 . in that case",
    ", one can deduce the famous formula eq .",
    "for the squid , and the maximum of the total current will depend on the magnetic flux as @xmath83 . in principle , one can obtain @xmath2 with different @xmath3 and @xmath4 by properly adjusting the parameters in the chemical potential ( [ chem ] ) .",
    "but in practice , it is quite difficult to arrive at this goal in order to satisfy the periodic condition for the scalar fields . on the other hand , in order to have @xmath2 , if we take the chemical potentials for both junctions are identically the same , we are then led to the same value of the phase difference , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath84 . in this case",
    "the corresponding squid is a trivial one , which is just double of a single josephson junction on each side ; the magnetic flux , @xmath85 , , this is because our numerics can only be performed in the vicinity of @xmath86 .",
    "please see the discussions below . ]",
    "vanishes , and there is no interference between the two junctions .    to overcome this trivial situation , we set the chemical potentials different on two sides of the ring as shown in fig.[mu ] , and then we can get a non - trivial interference between the two junctions , because in this case the phase differences are different for two junctions . below we will work in this spirit and manage to get the general relations between the maximal current and the magnetic flux @xmath1 in the general setup .",
    "the parameters we choose are like those in fig.[mu ] .",
    "the input values of the current @xmath87 run from @xmath88 , and then the total current @xmath0 are from @xmath89 . by performing the numerical calculations , we will get a list of the phase differences @xmath3 and @xmath4 for two junctions . because we scan the values of @xmath87 , we can obtain a one parameter curve in the 3d space spanned by @xmath90 , which is plotted in the left panel of fig.[jtotal ] .",
    "( left . ) the total current @xmath0 versus phase difference @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the larger points represent @xmath0 while the smaller points are the projections of the larger points on @xmath91 plane ; ( right . )",
    "the maximal current @xmath92 versus the magnetic flux @xmath1 from the relation .,title=\"fig : \" ]   ( left . ) the total current @xmath0 versus phase difference @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the larger points represent @xmath0 while the smaller points are the projections of the larger points on @xmath91 plane ; ( right . )",
    "the maximal current @xmath92 versus the magnetic flux @xmath1 from the relation .,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to obtain the interference relation between @xmath0 and the phase differences @xmath93 ( @xmath53 ) , we fit the sine relations @xmath94 for two junctions @xmath56 separately , and then @xmath95 .",
    "the fitted result is j_total=0.541(_1)+0.184(_2 ) . here",
    "@xmath96 and @xmath97 , clearly they are not equal . when @xmath98 , the general form of eq .",
    "is [ jtotal2 ] j_total = j_1c(_1)+j_2c(_2)=j_c(_c ) , where j_c&=&,[jsin ] + _ c&=&_1 + ( ) + & & + \\ {    c 0,j_1c+j_2c(_2-_1)0 + , j_1c+j_2c(_2-_1)<0    .",
    "note that in the parameter range we choose , @xmath99 is always satisfied .",
    "we therefore have @xmath100 $ ] .",
    "notice again that we have @xmath101 in our model . by virtue of eq .",
    ", we plot the relation between the maximal current @xmath92 and the magnetic flux @xmath1 in the right panel of fig.[jtotal ] . here",
    "we can not produce a complete periodic behavior of @xmath92 with respect to the magnetic flux @xmath1 , but only a part of a period .",
    "the reason is that our numerical calculations are done in the vicinity of @xmath102 , that is , for small values of @xmath103 .",
    "this is caused by the numerical methods we used .",
    "for higher values of @xmath48 or @xmath104 , the numerical stability and the numerical precision are out of control .",
    "a similar situation also appears in the study of holographic josephson junctions  @xcite",
    "we constructed a holographic model of squid in the einstein - maxwell - complex scalar theory with a negative cosmological constant by compactifying one spatial direction of the schwarzschild - ads black brane .",
    "a general relation between the maximal current and the magnetic flux through the squid ring was deduced via numerical methods .",
    "we worked with a chemical potential so that there are only different depths of the chemical potential for the two junctions .",
    "but other differences in the chemical potential for the two junctions will lead to a similar result .",
    "note that the probe limit was adopted in this paper , it is therefore of interest to study the effect of back reaction of the matter fields .",
    "in addition , considering the two junctions we studied here are the sns form , it would be interesting to discuss the case of the squid ring composed by two superconductor - insulator - superconductor ( sis ) junctions .",
