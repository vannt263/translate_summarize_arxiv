    "photon is one of the oldest elementary particle with very well known ( qed ) properties , and as such it is considered to be a tool to test the structure of more complicated objects like a proton .",
    "for example , in the dis@xmath0 , considered as the main source of information on the inner structure of the proton , the structure functions @xmath1 for the proton can be measured .",
    "the probe - in a wide range of @xmath2 - is provided by flux of virtual photons , emitted by primary electrons ( positrons ) .    -11.9cm-0.7 cm   -0.9 cm    so , besides proton also electron and photon are involved in the measurement of the structure functions and the parton densities of the proton .",
    "a _ factorization _ allows to treat independently the electron and proton part ( figure above ) .",
    "the contributions of the longitudinal ( l ) and transverse ( t ) virtual photons can also be _",
    "separated_. therefore , we can write @xmath3    note , that the structure functions @xmath1 are proportional to the combinations of the cross sections for processes @xmath4 . one can ask if the photon is only a in such measurements and to what extend its apparent `` structure '' influences the corresponding structure functions of the proton ?",
    "effects of the `` structure '' of the photon may influence our knowledge of the partonic content of the proton also in the large-@xmath5 photoproduction at hera .",
    "however here both the initial ( almost real ) photon and the initial proton are on equal footing and it is natural nowdays to take into account partonic content of both of them .    similarly , the dis events at hera , if correspond to the large-@xmath5 single particle or jet production for @xmath6 , are sensitive to the `` structure '' of the virtual photon ( with virtuality @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is clear , that if we want to understand a proton , we should understand a photon itself .",
    "it is interesting to realized that approximately at the same time ( 1922 - 3 ) we have learned that the proton is not a fundamental particle , while the photon is such a particle ( compton effect ) . since early sixties xx we realized that the photon in fact belongs to a `` hadron family '' with the closest relatives ( according to the vmd idea)- the vector mesons:@xmath7 and @xmath8",
    "next , the notion of a partonic content of @xmath9 have been introduced to describe in an effective way its hadronic interaction .",
    "at present colliders testing the partonic content of the photon is a difficult task , as at both lep and hera the photon is not a primary particle .",
    "the question if it is simpler to deal with a partonic content of the electron was addressed during this workshop .    in the inclusive process",
    "@xmath10 one can probe the `` structure '' of photon in various ways depending on the virtualities of emitted photons , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( figure below ) : + @xmath13 the region @xmath14 corresponds to dis@xmath15 , where one can measure the structure functions of the virtual photon .",
    "+ @xmath13 for @xmath16 , @xmath17 the corresponding process is dis@xmath18 , where one can measure the structure functions of the real photon .",
    "+ @xmath13 for @xmath19 the total cross section @xmath20 can be studied .",
    "-1.2cm,1.2 cm",
    "-7.0 cm    in the dis events @xmath21 various structure functions for the real photons can be measured in principle , however data are mainly for @xmath22 .    the @xmath22 structure function can be related to the partonic densities of the real photon . in the parton model ( pm ) one obtains a prediction from a pure qed that the quark densities @xmath23 , and that @xmath24 are large at the large value of @xmath25 . in qcd",
    "there are leading @xmath26 corrections which can be sum up to all orders using an inhomogeneous dglap evolution equations .",
    "this form of equation allows to obtain an asymptotic solutions for quark densities in the photon without any input . in practice , one use an input usually based on vmd ( sometimes modelled by @xmath27 ( sic ! ) ) .    in many analyses the quark densities in @xmath9 are treated as being proportional to @xmath28 , while in others to @xmath29 , since the main @xmath26-dependence mentioned above has nothing to do with qcd and @xmath30 .",
    "the way of counting has practical consequences as it influences the choice of diagrams which define the nlo set .",
    "the cross section for the large-@xmath5 hadronic processes involving photons get contributions from diagrams with the direct and the resolved photon interaction with quarks .",
    "note , that the resolved - photon contribution are possible for real and virtual photons , in the latter case provided that @xmath31 is larger that @xmath32 - a `` virtuality '' of the @xmath33 .",
    "note that for the resolved virtual photons processes one should take into account not only cross section for a defined polarization of @xmath33 ( l or t ) but also , since @xmath9 is not a primary particle , the corresponding interference terms : lt and t1 t2 .",
    "there many new data for the proton from hera and for photon from the lep ( dis and  large-@xmath5  events ) and from hera (  large-@xmath5 events  ) , as presented at this workshop .",
    "there is an impressive theoretical progress in the construction of the parton parametrizations for the proton with a higher precision and using various evolution equations , dglap , bfkl and ccfm . of a great importance",
    "are special treatments of the heavy - quark thresholds and error analyses of parton densities preformed recently .",
    "this stimulates the corresponding progress for a photon , reported during workshop .",
    "* in 1934 l. de broglie considered `` the neutrino theory of light '' , with the light quanta composed of @xmath34 pairs ( also pauli , heisenberg , jordan , kronig , born ) .",
    "no satisfactory derivation of bose statistics of light quanta from fermi statistics for @xmath35 was found and this idea was abandoned ( almost ) . *",
    "the new idea is a non - commutative qed with a selfinteraction of photons .",
    "_ the study of light has resulted in achievements of insight , imagination and ingenuity unsurpassed in any field of mental activity ; it illustrates , too , better than any other branch of physics , the vicissitudes of theories _",
