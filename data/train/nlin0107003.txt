    "fluctuation - response ( f / r ) relation plays an important role in statistical mechanics and , more generally , in systems with chaotic dynamics . with the term f / r relation one",
    "indicates the connection between the relaxation properties of a system and its response to an external perturbation .",
    "the relevance of this relation is evident : it allows to connect `` non - equilibrium '' features ( i.e. response and relaxation ) to `` equilibrium''@xcite properties ( correlation functions ) . as an important example , we mention the green - kubo @xcite formulas in the linear response theory which links the response to an external field with correlations computed at equilibrium .",
    "consider a system whose state is given by a finite dimension vector @xmath0 , the average linear response @xmath1 is the average response after a time @xmath2 of the variable @xmath3 to a small perturbation of the variable @xmath4 at time @xmath5 .",
    "under rather general conditions ( basically one has to assume that the system is mixing ) it is possible to show that a generalized f / r relation holds @xcite : @xmath6 \\ra , \\label{eq : fr}\\ ] ] where the functions @xmath7 depend on the invariant probability distribution @xmath8 : @xmath9 = -{\\partial \\ln \\rho({\\bf x } ) \\over \\partial x_j}. \\label{eq : rho}\\ ] ] the physical meaning of ( [ eq : fr ] ) is the following : consider a small perturbation @xmath10 at @xmath5 ; the average distance @xmath11 from the unperturbed values @xmath12 is @xmath13 for hamiltonian systems one realizes that ( [ eq : fr ] ) is the usual linear response theory .",
    "if @xmath8 is gaussian , one has a simple relationship between the response and the correlation function : @xmath14 in the general case , i.e. non - gaussian statistics , formula ( [ eq : fr ] ) gives just a qualitative information , i.e. the existence of a link between response and the general correlation function @xmath15 \\ra$ ] .",
    "+ in particular , in the most interesting cases in which @xmath8 is unknown , it is extremely important that f / r relation ( [ eq : fr ] ) exists , because it allows to control some properties of the invariant measure , @xmath8 , in terms of the response - functions behavior . in the past , this has not always been clear , e.g. some authors claim ( with qualitative arguments ) that in fully developed turbulence there is no relation between equilibrium fluctuations and relaxation to equilibrium @xcite , while a proper statement would limit to the non existence of the usual `` gaussian - like '' f / r relation ( [ eq : gaussfr ] ) .",
    "+ response functions have a clear phenomenological importance in many applied problems where one needs to control and/or predict the system reaction as a function of external spatial and/or temporal perturbations .",
    "response functions , also known as green functions , play also a very important role in many theoretical attempts to attack non - equilibrium problems . in particular , in many analytical approach to hydrodynamical problems described by navier - stokes eqs , or models of them , greens functions naturally show up both in perturbative schemes @xcite and closure - like attempts like the dia approximation @xcite .",
    "we stress that the f / r , in the form ( [ eq : fr ] ) , is a rather general relation which does not depend too much on the details of the measure of the systems , e.g. both in presence or absence of an energy flux . for example , in the field of disordered systems the f / r had been widely studied in order to highlight non trivial relaxation aspects e.g. aging phenomena . in this paper",
    "we want to address the problem of f / r relation for the case of dynamical models with many degrees of freedom and many characteristic times .",
    "we are also interested in exploiting the f / r relation in models which exhibit strong departure from gaussian statistics .",
    "we introduce a suitable new numerical method for measuring the characteristic times involved in the response functions .",
    "+ this new method is based on the idea to characterize the response behavior as a function of its _ halving time statistics _",
    "( hts ) , i.e. the time , @xmath16 , necessary for the response from a typical infinitesimal perturbation to reach , say , one half of its initial value .",
    "+ the plan of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we investigate a dynamical system with many degrees of freedom and many different characteristic times where still a classical gaussian set of f / r relations holds .",
    "the model is the so - called `` orszag - mclaughlin '' model which is used to probe the effective improvement of halving - time - statistics with respect to the usual direct measurement of time decaying properties . than , we attack the much less trivial case of characterizing response behavior in models for three dimensional turbulent energy cascade , i.e. shell models @xcite . + also in the latter case",
    ", the _ halving time statistics _ will allow us to measure with good accuracy the non - trivial time properties of green functions .",
    "as a result , we show that also the response function ( which probes linear features of the dynamical evolution ) is strongly affected by the _ non - linear _ inertial range physics . as a consequence ,",
    "short range interactions between neighboring shells are thought to characterize the invariant measure describing shell - velocity fluctuations .",
    "before entering the detailed description of the results , we want to discuss a practical problem for the numerical computation of @xmath17 . in numerical simulations ,",
    "@xmath18 is computed perturbing the variable @xmath3 at time @xmath19 with an `` infinitesimal '' kick of amplitude @xmath20 , for @xmath21 , and the deviation @xmath22 is computed integrating the two trajectories @xmath23 and @xmath24 up to a prescribed time @xmath25 . at time",
    "@xmath26 the variable @xmath3 is again perturbed with another kick , and a new sample @xmath27 is computed and so forth .",
    "the procedure is repeated @xmath28 times and the mean response is then evaluated as @xmath29 in presence of chaos , the absolute value of the deviation , @xmath30 , typically grows exponentially with @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the mean response , @xmath18 , is the result of a delicate balance of terms with non - fixed sign . as a result , we have that the error @xmath31 on @xmath18 increases exponentially with @xmath2 @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the generalized lyapunov exponent of second order ( greater or equal the maximum lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "one easily understands the main problem in trying to numerically compute any response function for large times : one needs to control an observable which is rapidly decaying to zero with exponentially - large fluctuations . in practice",
    ", it turns out to be impossible to have a reliable control on the asymptotic behavior of green functions ( see next sections and figures therein ) . + in order to avoid this trouble we propose another approach .",
    "let us first consider only _ diagonal _ responses , i.e. response after a time @xmath2 of the @xmath34-th variable from a perturbation of the same @xmath34-th variable at time @xmath5 , @xmath35 .    in this case , we claim that it is possible to have a good characterization of the main temporal properties by looking at the _ halving time statistics _ ( hts ) , that is at the probability density functions , @xmath36 of the time @xmath16 necessary to see an appreciable decay of the response function : @xmath37 , with the threshold @xmath38 fixed to a macroscopic value , say @xmath39 .",
    "in practice , one performs many response experiments , by collecting the statistics of the times necessary to see the response become one half of its initial value .",
    "the advantage of this hts with respect to the more standard way of characterizing the mean response @xmath40 with some typical time is that one does not need to know any functional behavior for the averaged response and , moreover , one has also a control on the fluctuations of the characteristic times , i.e. the hts integrates all times corresponding to _ halving events_. in the following , we show that the hts is at least able to reproduce with good accuracy the same results of the direct fitting procedure of the averaged response in cases when the classical f / r relation ( [ eq : gaussfr ] ) holds ( orszag - mclaughlin model , i.e. gaussian statistics ) and , more interesting , it is also able to give new hints on the f / r relations when time - intermittency and strong departure from gaussianity are present ( shell models ) . in the following",
    "we will also discuss the cases of non - diagonal responses , @xmath41 , with @xmath42 and the cases of generalized higher order responses @xmath43 .",
    "let us consider the following model @xcite : @xmath44 with @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and the periodic condition @xmath47 .",
    "this model contains some of the main features of inviscid hydrodynamics : a ) there are quadratic interactions ; b ) a quadratic invariant exists ( @xmath48 ) ; c ) the liouville theorem holds . for sufficiently large @xmath49",
    "the distribution of each variable @xmath50 is gaussian . in this situation ,",
    "classical f / r relationship exists for each of the @xmath34 variables : self - response functions to infinitesimal perturbations are indistinguishable from the corresponding self - correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we have slightly modified the system ( [ eq : orszag ] ) in order to have variables with different characteristic times .",
    "this can be done , for instance , by rescaling the evolution time of each variable : @xmath51 where the factor @xmath52 is a function of the `` number of identification '' ( e.g. site in the chain ) of the variables defined as @xmath53 , with @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for @xmath56 , with the `` mirror '' property @xmath57 .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the quadratic observable @xmath58 is no longer invariant during the time evolution of the system ( [ eq : orszagdiff ] ) .",
    "the mean energy per mode , @xmath59 ( not shown ) , follows a linear law with @xmath60",
    ". it can be demonstrated that a new quadratic integral of motion exists , and this has the form : @xmath61 moreover , the @xmath50 variables are shown to preserve the gaussian statistics to a good extent . therefore , the only effect of the change in the original orszag - mclaughlin system is that each variable now has its own characteristic time .",
    "let us see how correlation and response functions behave for the system ( [ eq : orszagdiff ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : flures ] the self - correlation functions @xmath62 and the self - response functions @xmath63 are shown . as a consequence of the preserved gaussian statistics , f / r relation of the form ( [ eq : gaussfr ] ) holds for each of the variables , at least over time delays not too long .",
    "the ( linear ) response functions are computed as decay functions of single variable perturbations to infinitesimal instantaneous `` kicks '' , averaged over a large number of simulations .",
    "if we conventionally define the correlation time of a variable @xmath50 as the time delay @xmath64 after which the correlation function becomes lower than the value @xmath65 , we find that : @xmath66 the exponent of the scaling law ( [ eq : ct ] ) can be explained with a dimensional argument , by noticing that from the mean energy per variable we get @xmath67 , so from ( [ eq : orszagdiff ] ) and ( [ eq : int ] ) the characteristic time results to be @xmath68 .",
    "we notice that the scaling ( [ eq : ct ] ) is robust with respect to the choice of the threshold value , @xmath38 , i.e. it is observed even if the decay factor @xmath38 is chosen slightly different from @xmath65 .",
    "the response time @xmath69 is defined as the time interval after which the averaged response function becomes lower than @xmath65 .",
    "we must observe that the computation of the mean response function is practically impossible after a certain time delay , because of exponentially growing errors .",
    "last , halving times @xmath70 have been computed always for the variables of the system ( [ eq : orszagdiff ] ) , using the same procedure as before ( i.e. infinitesimal kicks ) .",
    "the halving time pdf s decay exponentially and , as can be shown , they all can be `` collapsed '' to the same renormalized pdf for a proper rescaling of the halving time ( see below ) .",
    "a comparative plot of @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath69 is shown in figure  [ fig : hthrct ] .",
    "halving times and correlation times follow the same scaling law with @xmath52 and , for each variable , have values very close to each other .",
    "typical time decaying of the averaged response , @xmath69 are very difficult to estimate due to high errors for slow variables .",
    "in fact , only a few points are shown in figure  [ fig : hthrct ] , the ones for which the mean response drops down to @xmath65 fast enough , before the statistical error become too large ( say larger than @xmath73 ) .",
    "the advantage of the hts with respect to the mean response function is that , with the same statistics , halving times can be computed for all variables within reasonable uncertainty , while response times , @xmath69 , are generally affected by exponentially growing errors and are practically not defined when the typical relaxation time scale is longer than the error growth time scale .",
    "the numerically computed pdf s of the halving time @xmath16 can be rescaled as follows : @xmath74 we show in figure  [ fig : orszagpdf ] the overlap of some rescaled pdf s of the halving times . as a consequence , all moments of the @xmath70 pdf s have a simple scaling @xmath75    we have found that in a gaussian case , the response to infinitesimal perturbations can be characterized both with the classic mean response function and with the mean halving time technique .",
    "it is worth stressing that the hts could be the only technique usable for studying relaxation to non linear perturbation in complex systems .",
    "shell models for turbulent energy cascade have proved to share many statistical properties with turbulent three dimensional velocity fields @xcite .",
    "let us introduces a set of wavenumber @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the shell - velocity variables @xmath78 must be understood as the velocity fluctuation over a distances @xmath79 .",
    "it is possible to write down many different sets of coupled odes possessing the same kinematical features necessary to mimics navier - stokes non - linear evolution . in the following",
    "we will present numerical results for a particular choice , the so - called sabra model @xcite , namely : @xmath80 + f_n , \\label{shell_v}\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is a free parameter , @xmath82 is the molecular viscosity and @xmath83 is an external forcing acting only at large scales , necessary to maintain a stationary temporal evolution .",
    "the main , strong , difference with the model discussed in the previous section consists in the existence of a mean energy flux from large to small scales which drives the system toward a strongly non - gaussian stationary temporal evolution @xcite .",
    "shell models here discussed presents exactly the same qualitative difficulties of the original navier - stokes eqs : strong non - linearity and far from equilibrium statistical fluctuations . the most striking quantitative feature of the non - gaussian statistics is summarized in the existence of anomalous scaling laws of velocity moments : @xmath84 with @xmath85 .",
    "anomalous scaling , also known as intermittency , is the quantitative way to state that velocity pdf s at different scales can not be rescaled by any changing of variables .",
    "+ let us now discuss two subtle points .",
    "using some general arguments from the dynamical systems theory , one has that all the ( typical ) correlation functions at large time delay have to relax to zero with the same characteristic time , related to spectral properties of the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "if one uses this argument in a blind way , the apparently paradoxical result is that all correlation functions , @xmath86 , must go to zero with same characteristic times . on",
    "the contrary one expects a whole hierarchy of characteristic times distinguishing the behavior of the correlation functions at different scales @xcite",
    ". in particular , the self - correlation function , @xmath87 , decays with a characteristic time decreasing with @xmath34 .",
    "the paradox is only apparent since the dynamical systems argument is valid at very long times , i.e. much longer than the longest characteristic time , and therefore in systems with many different time - fluctuations it is not helpful .",
    "in fact , it is well established numerically and well understood theoretically @xcite that general multi - scale multi - time correlation functions of the kind @xmath88 are described by the cascade formalism , in particular , most of the statistical properties in the inertial range can be well parametrized by the multi - fractal - formalism .",
    "+ on the other hand , the response properties are related to infinitesimal perturbations .",
    "therefore , a priori , it is not obvious that the response depend on inertial range properties .",
    "the existence of the f / r relation and the fact that @xmath87 ( and other similar correlation functions ) are determined by the inertial range properties suggest that also the response features are ruled by the inertial range behavior if the invariant measure is dominated by local interactions among shells .",
    "+ let us now examine the numerical results concerning response functions in the shell model .",
    "+ figure  [ rf7to14 ] shows the diagonal mean response , @xmath40 , for a range of inertial shells , @xmath89 $ ] .",
    "the most striking property is the impossibility to follow the response behavior at large scales ( small shells ) for large times , i.e. the explicit evidence that errors grow exponentially . in order to compare the different behavior ( and different error propagation ) between response and correlation function , we plot in fig .",
    "( [ repcor10 ] ) both the average response and the self - correlation , @xmath87 , for the shell @xmath90 .",
    "as it is clear from the previous figures , only response at the smallest scales ( fast scales ) in the inertial range can be computed with enough accuracy to follow an asymptotic decay . still , also for this response the clear departure between",
    "the response and the self - correlation shows is another indication that the inertial - range statistics is far from gaussian .",
    "by using hts we can get an information on the temporal dependence of response function in the whole range of inertial shells . in figure  [ 3traj ] , we report some realizations of the instantaneous response function , which shows typical halving time experiments .    in figure   ( [ htrtctsm ] ) , we summarize the results we obtain by comparing the _ mean halving time _ ,",
    "@xmath71 , with the characteristic times one extract from the decay properties of both mean response , @xmath69 , and correlation functions , @xmath72 , for those shells where such a behavior can be safely extracted .",
    "it is worth noticing how the _ mean halving time _ allows a full characterization of time properties also for those shells where the mean response @xmath40 can not be measured for large time legs , @xmath2 .",
    "also , the dependence from the scale of the mean halving time is given as a best fit @xmath91 , with @xmath92 .",
    "the value @xmath92 can be seen as an intermittent correction to the dimensional inertial - range prediction @xmath93 . on the other hand ,",
    "the dependency from the scale of @xmath69 is difficult to extract due to the small number of points available .",
    "let us now focus on the whole pdf of the halving time statistics .",
    "we first analyze the positive and negative moments of the halving times :    @xmath94    with @xmath95 .",
    "dimensional , non intermittent , scaling would predict the linear behavior for the scaling exponents : @xmath96 . in figure  [ psip ]",
    "we plot the results for the halving times scaling exponents @xmath97 for all moments from @xmath98 and the straight line corresponding to the dimensional inertial range estimate .",
    "we notice that intermittent corrections are much stronger for the positive moments than for the negative moments .",
    "this must be related to the fact that positive moments of the halving times are dominated by rare events where the response has a very long decaying .",
    "we interpret the fact that @xmath99 as an indication that linear response functions are inertial range quantities .",
    "the latter results leads to the important conclusion that the invariant measure is well approximated by short range interaction among shells in the inertial range .    as for the non - diagonal response function and for the generalized response function of higher order the numerical problems to measure them are even more pronounced .",
    "first , let us examine the off - diagonal response function @xmath100 .",
    "of course these responses start from zero at time zero instead than from one as in the diagonal case .",
    "measure them by a direct average is strictly impossible because of very large errors .",
    "we still decided to measure their characteristic time by using the time the response reach a `` macroscopic '' fraction , say @xmath65 , of the typical fluctuations on the scale where we are measuring the response , i.e. we collect the statistics of the first times @xmath16 such that @xmath101 .",
    "we expect a strong asymmetry of the characteristic times depending whether the perturbation is done at smaller ( @xmath102 ) or larger ( @xmath103 ) scales .",
    "indeed , by using usual inertial range arguments we expect that the response reacts always with a typical time given by the time of the largest between the two shells involved @xmath104 . by fixing therefore the shell where we perturb , say @xmath105",
    ", we expect that the typical time of @xmath106 , @xmath107 is constant when @xmath108 and scales as @xmath109 when @xmath110 . in figure  [ htnd ] we show that indeed this behavior is well reproduced numerically .",
    "+ the strong intermittency shown by halving times in figure  [ psip ] is the clear signature of deviations from simple gaussian - like behavior of response functions .",
    "we must therefore also expect that generalized responses of higher order are not simply related to the linear response .",
    "for example , let us consider the third moments of the linear response@xcite : @xmath111 a simple non - intermittent behavior would suggest that @xmath112 while in figure  [ grnl13 ] it is possible to see that this is definitely not the case for all @xmath2 legs where we have a measurable signal . unfortunately the already discussed statistical problems in measuring averaged response functions for long times",
    "are even more pronounced for generalized response functions .",
    "therefore we refrain from showing any results for the scaling behavior of typical times of the generalized response functions .",
    "we have addressed the problem of measuring time - properties of response functions in gaussian models ( orszag - mclaughin ) and strongly non - gaussian models like shell models for turbulence .",
    "we have introduced the concept of _ halving time statistics _ with the aim to have a statistically stable tool to quantify the time decaying of response functions and generalized response functions of high - order .",
    "we have shown numerically that in shell models for three dimensional turbulence response functions    are inertial range quantities .",
    "this is a strong indication that the invariant measure describing the shell - velocity fluctuations is characterized by short range interactions between neighboring shells .",
    "+ response functions and generalized response - functions play an important role in any diagrammatic approach for non - linear out - of - equilibrium systems . in this work",
    "we have presented the first numerical attempt to measure some of their properties in a systematic way .",
