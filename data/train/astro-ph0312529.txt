    "one of the oldest problem in galactic dynamics is the determination of the mass distribution in the stellar and gaseous disk from observed velocities .",
    "observationally , noisy measurements along with a certain velocity dispersion makes this inverse problem difficult to solve ( beauvais & bothum , 2001 ) . from a theoretical point of view , various levels of approximation are possible . for instance , the inversion is straightforward if the disk is considered as a flattened spheroid , since the surface density is simply obtained by an inverse abel transform over the velocity field ( brandt , 1960 ) .",
    "flattened spheroids are however a poor representation of real disks ( e.g. kochanek 2001 ) .",
    "another , more intuitive way to proceed is to generate a collection of surface density profiles , then to determine the corresponding potential or gravitational field , and find only those which model the velocity data at best . for a razor - thin axi - symmetrical disk , only one numerical quadrature over its radial extent must be performed to obtain the potential or the field , which is a priori very convenient because time in - expansive .",
    "meanwhile , this operation is commonly believed to be numerically uncomfortable when using elliptic integrals ( binney & tremaine , 1987 , cuddeford , 1993 , kochanek , 2001 ) .",
    "the reason is that these functions contain a singularity everywhere in the source . as suggested by binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) ,",
    "this drawback can be simply avoided by considering field points located just above / below the equatorial plane .",
    "even if the potential and its radial derivative do generally not exhibit strong variations slightly off the mid - plane , such a vertical shift introduces an inconsistency or a bias . as a matter of fact , instead of elliptic integrals , most authors work with bessel functions which have finite amplitudes ( toomre , 1963 ) .",
    "but their oscillatory behavior and specially their spatial extension ( the infinite range ) are a severe disadvantage from a numerical point of view ( cuddeford , 1993 ; cohl & tohline 1999 ) .",
    "+ in this paper , we show that point mass singularities can be properly and easily handled numerically from elliptic integrals by density splitting . for the case of a disk with zero thickness",
    "as considered here , the gravitational potential and field can be determined exactly in the equatorial plane without any shift , and whatever the surface density profile ( provided it vanishes at the inner and outer edges of the disk ) . the extension to tri - dimensional disks is possible .",
    "for a disk with zero thickness , the expression for the radial gravitational field in the equatorial plane is known in a closed form .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates , this reads ( e.g durand , 1964 ) : @xmath0da , \\label{eq : potential}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the total surface density , @xmath2 is the field point , @xmath3 refers to the material distribution , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the inner and the outer radius of the disk , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively defined by @xmath8    and @xmath9    finally , @xmath10 ( respectively @xmath11 ) is the complete elliptic integral of the first ( resp .",
    "second ) kind . note that the integrand of equation ( [ eq : potential ] ) diverges as the modulus @xmath12 , namely when @xmath13 .",
    "the nature of the singularity is twofold : a logarithmic singularity due to the @xmath10-function , and a hyperbolic one due to the term @xmath14 .",
    "however , this singularity is integrable .",
    "there are different ways to estimate improper integrals .",
    "here is a simple and efficient recipe .",
    "let us write the surface density as @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the surface density at the field point and @xmath17 is the `` residual '' surface density which , by construction , equals zero when @xmath18 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : potential ] ) can be written as the sum of two contributions , namely : @xmath19    where @xmath20da \\label{eq : hom}\\ ] ]    is the radial gravitational field due to a radially homogeneous disk and @xmath21da \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ]    corresponds to the residual profile .",
    "the point is that the expression for @xmath22 also exists in a closed analytical form ( see appendix [ sec : appena ] ) .",
    "this quantity is finite everywhere inside the disk , even at the disc edges provided that @xmath16 vanishes continuously there .",
    "it is important to mention that this restriction is no more necessary if we consider the disk as a tri - dimensional system . besides",
    ", @xmath23 can be easily computed numerically because both @xmath24 and @xmath25 are fully regular whatever @xmath3 and @xmath2 , and especially for @xmath18 ( see appendix [ sec : appenb ] for a proof ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the accuracy on @xmath23 ( and subsequently on the total field @xmath26 ) depends only on the performance of the quadrature scheme used to performed the radial integral in equation ( [ eq:1 ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ figure ] , we illustrate this simple and efficient technique by considering a disk with inner edge @xmath27 , outer edge @xmath28 and surface density @xmath29 as commonly used to model spiral galaxies ( freeman , 1970 ) .",
    "the graph shows the residual profile @xmath30 , as well as the two regular functions @xmath24 and @xmath25 . here",
    ", the field point where stands the singularity is arbitrarily set to @xmath31 ( about the middle of the disk ) .",
    "we can now apply this method to compute the rotation law @xmath32 of any disk , whatever its size and surface density profile . here",
    ", we simply assume that the contribution to the rotation is only gravitation ( and neglect pressure and viscosity effects ) .",
    "thus , @xmath32 is defined by the relation @xmath33 where : @xmath34    and @xmath35 using the previous expressions for the radial field , these two terms respectively read : @xmath36-{\\bf e}\\left(\\frac{r_{\\rm in}}{r}\\right)+{\\bf k}\\left(\\frac{r_{\\rm in}}{r}\\right)\\right\\ } \\label{eq : omegahomo}\\ ] ]    and @xmath37da \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ]    these two expressions are easy to compute numerically , for reasons mentioned above .",
    "let us remind that at the edges , @xmath38 vanishes because @xmath39 as assumed ( see above ) .",
    "we have reported a simple and efficient method to compute the radial field and the rotation curve of any razor - thin axi - symmetric disk in the mid - plane , using complete elliptic integrals . as a matter of fact",
    ", a similar treatment can be considered for the gravitational potential .",
    "even , this splitting technique can be employed to disks with finite ( non - zero ) thickness as suggested in hur ( 2003 ) , and to the fully tri - dimensional systems as well ( pierens & hur 2004 ) .",
