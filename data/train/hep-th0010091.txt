    "four - dimensional n=1 supersymmetric type iib orientifolds ( @xcite and references therein ) provide a fertile ground to study new physics implications of perturbative open - string theories which in turn could shed light on the physics of strongly coupled heterotic string models . in this effort one",
    "is at fairly early stages .",
    "one goal , that is far from being achieved , is the development of techniques that would yield a larger class of solutions ( see e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) than those based on symmetric orientifold constructions .",
    "another direction is the exploration of possible deformations of symmetric orientifold models , which in turn may provide large new classes of models which may eventually lead to models with quasi - realistic features .",
    "such deformations fall into two classes : ( i ) wilson lines , which in the t - dual picture correspond to branes moved to different positions on the orientifold , ( ii ) blow - up of orientifold singularities .",
    "the deformations in the space of supersymmetric four - dimensional solutions have a field - theoretic realization ; one identifies specific d- and f - flat directions within the effective theory of the original model .",
    "the effective field theory at the new ( deformed ) supersymmetric ground states is a power - series in the magnitude of the vacuum expectation values of the fields responsible for the deformation .",
    "in particular , this technique was used to study the blowing - up of the orientifold singularities @xcite , where the @xmath2 @xcite and @xmath4 n=1 d=4 orientifolds are used as prototypes .",
    "results are different in nature from those of perturbative heterotic orbifolds @xcite .",
    "the blowing - up deformation is notoriously difficult to describe within the full string theory context , since the metric of the blown - up space is not explicitly known . on the other hand",
    "the explicit field - theoretic realization in terms of ( non - abelian ) flat directions allows for the determination of the surviving gauge groups and massless spectrum .    on the other hand wilson lines , both continuous and discrete ,",
    "can in principle be constructed within full string theory .",
    "the t - dual interpretation of continuous wilson lines corresponds to a set of branes located at generic points on the orientifold , while discrete wilson lines correspond to special cases of sets of branes located at the orbifold fixed points .",
    "deformation by continuous wilson lines admits an interpretation in the effective field theory as specific d- and f - flat directions , which describe ( in the t - dual picture ) infinitesimal motion of sets of branes away from the fixed points .",
    "explicit examples of discrete wilson lines have been constructed for a number of different orientifold models ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "continuous wilson lines were first addressed in @xcite , but the explicit unitary representation was not given .",
    "the explicit unitary representation of the continuous wilson line , specifically constructed for the @xmath2 orientifold , along with the most general set of continuous wilson lines and their field theory realization for @xmath2 orientifold was recently given in @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to advance the techniques to construct models with general discrete wilson lines for general symmetric type iib orientifolds .",
    "in particular we construct the explicit form of such wilson lines which satisfy both the algebraic consistency conditions and the tadpole consistency conditions .",
    "we carry out our discussion in the t - dual picture , where wilson lines have a geometric interpretation as sets of branes located at different fixed points .",
    "algebraic consistency conditions amount to the consistency of the location of these branes with the orbifold / orientifold symmetries .",
    "we also show that the t - dual tadpole consistency conditions are related to the original ones by a discrete fourier transform .",
    "we apply these techniques to fully explore the @xmath0 orientifold model with a very general choice of discrete wilson lines .",
    "however , we would like to emphasize the techniques are general , and apply to other orientifolds as well .",
    "one of the motivations to study this particular model is that it could be very interesting from the phenomenological point of view , since it may allow for putting branes at @xmath2 _ orbifold _ points ( that are not fixed under orientifold projection ) .",
    "the relevance of configurations of branes at @xmath2 orbifold points to obtain potentially realistic models has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "if six branes are located at such points such sectors may provide standard model gauge groups with three families .",
    "however , we find the consistency constraints do not allow for the gauge structure @xmath5 in such sectors .",
    "this is only possible if one includes anti - branes in the model and breaks supersymmetry ( in a hidden sector ) .",
    "nevertheless we carry out a systematic exploration of all the possible models with n=1 supersymmetry and find a small class of inequivalent models .",
    "when restricting to models containing sectors with @xmath6 gauge group factors , as candidates for @xmath7 , we find only two inequivalent classes , with a possible gauge group assignment @xmath8 that arises from branes located at the @xmath0 orbifold fixed point .",
    "we provide the full massless spectrum and the yukawa couplings , thus setting the stage for further phenomenological explorations of this model .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in section [ wl ]",
    "we construct both order three ( subsection [ wlo3 ] ) and order two ( subsection [ wlo2 ] ) discrete wilson lines for @xmath0 orientifold , as well as continuous wilson lines ( subsection [ cwl ] ) , and provide their t - dual interpretation . in section [ tadpole ]",
    "we provide the tadpole cancellation conditions in a class of models with arbitrary number of order three wilson lines . for completeness",
    "we also describe the tadpole constraints in the t - dual version , and show ( in the appendix ) they are related to the tadpole conditions in the original picture by a discrete fourier transform . in section [ spectrum ]",
    "we describe in detail the orbifold and orientifold projections , both in terms of d9- and d5@xmath9-branes ,- branes ( d7@xmath10-branes ) the d5-branes ( d7-branes ) wrapped on ( transverse to ) the @xmath11 complex plane . ] and in a t - dual picture of d3 and d7@xmath9-branes , to obtain the spectra of the models in subsequent sections . in section [ models ]",
    "we systematically explore the gauge group structure of models with discrete wilson lines ( subsection [ smodels ] ) , and focus on a particular solution ( subsection [ semi ] ) with potentially phenomenologically interesting features .",
    "we also present a solution with anti - branes ( subsection [ anti ] ) , which provides a realistic gauge group with three families . in section [ conclusions ]",
    "we summarize and discuss the results and techniques developed in this paper , and conclude with possible further applications .",
    "the techniques to construct @xmath12 type iib orientifolds based on orbifolds @xmath13 and @xmath14 are by now standard and we refer the reader to , e.g. , @xcite for a detailed discussion of such models as well as the notations and conventions .",

    "in addition , @xmath27 must be symmetric for d9-branes and antisymmetric for d5-branes .",
    "in addition , ramond - ramond ( rr ) sector tadpole cancellation conditions must be imposed on the chan - paton matrices to ensure the consistency of the theory .",
    "after successful embedding of the orientifold action , the open string states , including gauge bosons and matter fields , can be easily constructed .",
    "we shall start with the analysis for the @xmath0 orbifold , and only at a later stage incorporate the orientifold projection @xmath21 .",
    "also in this section we shall focus primarily on the algebraic constraints on the model , i.e. we discuss the building blocks for the wilson lines , leaving the study of tadpole cancellation conditions for the subsequent sections .",

    "it is possible to see that the main obstruction to obtain three - family models with realistic gauge groups in the framework we have described is the limited amount of available branes .",
    "for instance , following the approach in @xcite , one may try to obtain such a realistic sector from a set of six d3-branes at one of the @xmath150 orbifold points .",

    "we would like to briefly discuss the construction of a semi - realistic orientifold , with pati - salam gauge group @xmath272 and three families of quarks and leptons with correct gauge quantum numbers .",
    "this sector arises from a set of d3-branes sitting at a @xmath150 orbifold point , and is identical to those studied in @xcite .",
    "we start by placing 20 d7@xmath9-branes at @xmath215 with _ , 7_3,0=(e^i 16 _ 4 , e^i 36 _ 2 , e^i 56 _ 4 , e^i 76 _ 4 , e^i 96 _ 2 , e^i _ 4 ) .",
    "this choice differs from ( [ chorigin ] ) only by a traceless piece , so the analysis is similar to that described in subsection [ smodels ] . in particular , all crosscap tadpoles are canceled at points @xmath148 , except at the origin . in order to cancel the latter , we choose to introduce four -branes with _ , 3,(0,0,0)=(e^i 36 _ 2 , e^i 96 _ 2 ) .",
    "[ choanti ] -branes carry rr charges opposite to those of d3-branes , hence their contribution to tadpoles is opposite to that of a set of d3-branes with the same chan - paton matrix . using this fact , the above choice is seen to cancel the tadpole at @xmath141 .",
    "up to this point we have introduced 20 d7@xmath9-branes and 4 -branes , so cancellation of untwisted tadpoles requires the introduction of 12 additional d7@xmath9-branes , and 36 d3-branes , split symmetrically between the points at @xmath250 and its @xmath136 images .",
    "the discussion is analogous to that in subsection [ smodels ] , differing only in the total number of branes allowed .",
    "we locate six d7@xmath9-branes at @xmath250 ( and the remaining 6 at its @xmath136-image ) , with _ , 7_3,1 & = & ( e^i 16 , e^i 36 , e^i 56 , e^i 76 , e^i 96 , e^i ) , that is @xmath273 in ( [ enes ] ) .",
    "since this matrix is traceless , we may choose to place no d3-branes at @xmath175 , i.e. @xmath274 in ( [ emes ] ) . in order to have nontrivial sectors at the @xmath150 orbifold points , we introduce an order three wilson line along the first plane on the d7@xmath9-branes ,",

    "the important aspect we would like to point out is that the local behavior near the fixed point @xmath191 ( and its images ) is exactly as in the models in @xcite , hence this d3-brane sector leads automatically to a three - family @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath286 arises from the unique non - anomalous linear combination of @xmath240 s , purely in the d3-brane sector , and whose charge is given by q_b - l = -2(13 q_u(3)+12 q_u(2 ) + 12 q_u(2 ) ) .",
    "also note that , even though the full model is non - supersymmetric due to the presence of the anti - branes , the latter sit at @xmath215 , i.e. are separated from the semi - realistic sector , which enjoys @xmath12 supersymmetry , only broken at higher orders by the hidden anti - brane sector .",

    "the three copies of fields in the mixed sector actually differ in their charges under the d7@xmath9-brane gauge group @xmath287 , not shown here .",
    "in fact , we expect these additional @xmath240 s to be anomalous , and therefore broken and not present at low energies",
    ". we will not pursue their discussion here .    finally note that the model we have just constructed is in principle unstable against moving some of the d3-branes at @xmath191 and annihilating them with the -branes at the origin .",
    "this instability is identical to that in the models in @xcite , but it can be avoided in more involved constructions @xcite . in any event ,",
    "our purpose was to illustrate how the construction of realistic models using the @xmath0 orientifold is possible and relatively easy once the restriction of supersymmetry is relaxed .",
    "in this paper we set out to develop techniques to construct consistent n=1 supersymmetric four - dimensional solutions of open ( type i ) string theory compactified on @xmath288 and @xmath289 symmetric orientifolds , _ with general ( continuous and discrete ) wilson lines_. in particular , our approach advances the techniques beyond the special examples of discrete @xcite and continuous @xcite wilson lines .",
    "we have provided explicit solutions for the algebraic consistency conditions for discrete and continuous wilson lines along complex planes twisted by an order six action .",
    "we have also studied the tadpole consistency conditions on the @xmath0 orientifold with general wilson lines , and found explicit solution to this set of constraints , leading to interesting n=1 four - dimensional string vacua .",
    "and we would like to emphasize that our techniques in the construction of wilson lines are general and applicable to other models .",
    "in constructing models with wilson lines we have heavily employed the geometrical interpretation of discrete wilson line solutions in the t - dual picture as sets of branes located at the orbifold fixed points . in the t - dual picture",
    "the algebraic consistency conditions become constraints for the locations of these branes that are consistent with the orbifold and orientifold symmetries .",
    "we have also shown that the tadpole cancellation conditions for such t - dual models are related by a discrete fourier transform .",
    "this useful trick allows one to obtain tadpoles in t - dual models without the need of directly computing them , and illuminates the detailed relation between brane positions and wilson lines in orbifold models .    the second major motivation for advancing this program is phenomenological .",
    "models with discrete wilson lines naturally provide smaller gauge group structures ( associated with the set of branes located at the orbifold points ) , and thus could potentially lead to gauge sectors with the ingredients of the standard model .",
    "however , previous four - dimensional n=1 supersymmetric type i models ( with relatively simple configurations of brane locations and wilson lines ) yield gauge groups that can not directly provide a @xmath7 candidate ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in addition",
    ", most of the @xmath240 factors were anomalous and therefore massive , leading to a generic difficulty in obtaining @xmath290-hypercharge candidates for the standard model @xcite .",
    "the particular @xmath0 orientifold , explored in this paper , could potentially provide the candidate group structure for both @xmath7 as well as non - anomalous @xmath258 .",
    "the latter motivation was originally based on the observation @xcite that branes at _ orbifold _ points , which are not fixed under the orientifold projection , may allow for appearance of non - anomalous @xmath240 s , that could play the role of hypercharge .",
    "the systematic exploration of n=1 supersymmetric discrete wilson line solutions yields a surprisingly small number of non - equivalent classes of models .",
    "this result is due to the extremely tight tadpole consistency conditions for n=1 supersymmetric models , as well as the large symmetry group of the underlying geometry @xmath15 , which we exploit extensively to identify different equivalence classes . in particular , n=1 supersymmetry constraints",
    "do not allow us to locate six ( or more ) branes at the @xmath2 orbifold points and obtain realistic gauge structure from these d3 branes in the model , even though this is a configuration that has the potential for yielding three - family sectors with the standard model ( or left - right symmetric ) gauge group .",
    "however , as we demonstrated in subsection [ anti ] , such configurations are possible if one allows for the introduction of anti - branes in the model , which lead to the breakdown of supersymmetry in the anti - brane sector .",
    "the upshot of the exploration of n=1 supersymmetric models , which contain sectors with @xmath6 as a @xmath7 candidate , is the existence of only two inequivalent classes of such solutions .",
    "we provide the complete spectrum and trilinear superpotential couplings for one class ( the second equivalence class would yield an equivalent `` observable sector '' gauge group and spectrum ) .",
    "the model allows for the gauge group assignment : @xmath291 , with the non - abelian part arising from branes located at the @xmath0 orbifold fixed point .",
    "interestingly , the non - anomalous abelian factor @xmath286 is however a combination of @xmath240 factors arising from different sets of branes , namely d3- and d7-branes .",
    "unfortunately , the above particular gauge group assignment has a major flaw , since it leads to only two sets of quark families .",
    "nevertheless , other observable sector gauge group assignments are possible , and a more general phenomenological exploration of this model is under way @xcite .",
