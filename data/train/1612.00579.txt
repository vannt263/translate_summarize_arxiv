    ", the damped collisions of two actinide nuclei were investigated at gesellschaft fr schwerionenforschung ( gsi ) for hunting the shn @xcite . although no evidence for shn ( z@xmath4106 ) , a number of actinide isotopes are produced and the yields drastically decrease with the charged number .",
    "recently , the attempts to produce the neutron - rich nuclei around n=126 have been performed in the reactions of @xmath0xe+@xmath2pb @xcite and @xmath0xe+@xmath1pt @xcite .",
    "it was found that the shell closure plays an important role on the production of neutron - rich nuclei and more advantage with the multinucleon transfer ( mnt ) reactions in comparison to the projectile fragmentations @xcite .",
    "more experiments are planning for creating the heavy neutron - rich nuclei via the mnt , e.g. , the heavy - ion accelerator research facility in lanzhou ( hirfl ) .    in this work ,",
    "the dynamics of mnt reactions in collisions of two heavy nuclei is to be investigated with the dinuclear system ( dns ) model based on the statistical diffusion theory , in which a molecular configuration of two touching nuclei is assumed to keep their own individuality .",

    "it is obvious that the more nucleons are transferred with increasing the incident energy because of the more energy dissipation into the dns .",
    "the secondary decays lead to the similar yields for heavy fragments with z@xmath385 and a@xmath3210 at different energies .",
    "however , the lighter projectile ( target)-like fragments ( a@xmath57130 or a@xmath57200 ) are related to the bombarding energy .",

    "the n=126 shell closure enables the survival of neutron - rich nuclei formed in the mnt reactions .",
