    "the fate of the two  dimensional delocalized states ( ds s ) in a magnetic field became recently the subject of intensive experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite studies .",
    "the goal of these studies is to trace the position of ds s as magnetic field decreases .",
    "more than a decade ago it was predicted that with decreasing magnetic field each ds departs from the center of the landau level ( ll ) and floats up in energy ( levitation scenario @xcite ) .",
    "this prediction was derived from the non  interacting scaling theory of the quantum hall effect @xcite .",
    "since the position of a ds determines the boundary between the insulating and the quantum hall phases , such a floating implies that within some range of concentrations the electron gas undergoes an insulator  metal  insulator transition with decreasing magnetic field .",
    "later it was argued that this behavior should persist in the presence of interactions @xcite .",
    "experimental observation of the insulator  metal  insulator transition was reported by several groups @xcite .",
    "it is obvious just from the electron ",
    "hole symmetry that the deviation of ds from the center of landau level is possible only due to the disorder  induced ll mixing .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite indeed support the levitation scenario .",
    "analytical theory of the levitation was developed only for the region of magnetic fields where the departure of the ds from the center of ll is relatively small @xcite .",
    "it was assumed @xcite that the random potential is smooth , so that the structure of electronic states is described by the network model of chalker and coddington @xcite . in this model ,",
    "delocalization results from the tunneling of an electron through the saddle points of a random potential which are connected by equipotential lines .",
    "it was demonstrated that the ll mixing changes _ on average _ the transmittancy of a saddle point in such a way that it becomes smaller than 1/2 for the energy at the center of the ll .",
    "this means that to achieve the 1/2 average transmittancy , the energy should be shifted upwards , which is equivalent to the levitation . however , in a smooth potential the ll mixing is generally weak since it is associated with the large momentum transfer . short ",
    "range potential is much more effective in this respect .",
    "that is why in this paper we consider the situation when a small portion of short  range impurities is present in a sample in addition to a smooth potential . within the chalker ",
    "coddington model the shift in position of the ds results from the change in the transmittancy of a saddle point due to ll mixing .",
    "then it is obvious that impurities , responsible for this shift , are those that fall in the vicinity of saddle points .",
    "we assume the sign of the impurity potential to be random and show that the net effect of such impurities is the reduction of the transmittancy at a given energy , and , hence , the levitation of ds s , even if the mixing of ll s by a smooth potential is neglected .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : h ] we consider the motion of an electron in a strong magnetic field and a saddle  point potential with a short  range impurity located nearby .",
    "we derive the system of equations for the motion of the guiding center using the procedure developed by fertig and halperin @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : r ] we demonstrate that coupling of ll s by an impurity leads to the renormalization of its effective strength . in sec .",
    "[ sec : t ] a general expression for the transmission coefficient is derived and different limits are analyzed . in sec .",
    "v the impurity  induced change in the average transmittancy is studied . in sec .",
    "vi the magnitude of levitation of ds s , which results from the reduction of the average transmittancy is , estimated .",
    "the hamiltonian we consider has the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a potential of the saddle point ; @xmath4 is the short range potential of an impurity centered at the point @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is chosen in such a way that @xmath7 .",
    "we choose a symmetric gauge , * a*=@xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the magnetic field . to calculate the transmission coefficient of the saddle point",
    "we adopt the approach developed by fertig and halperin @xcite .",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the hamiltonian @xmath9 can be separated into two parts describing respectively the motion of a guiding center and a cyclotron motion . the unitary transformation which provides this separation is as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the magnetic length ( @xmath12 stands for the cyclotron frequency ) .",
    "the new operators satisfy the commutation relations @xmath13= \\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x},\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s } \\right]=0 $ ] , @xmath14=\\left[\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial s } , s \\right]=1 $ ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is determined by the equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the characteristic length defined as @xmath18 .",
    "the condition that the potential is smooth can be quantitatively expressed as @xmath19 , which means that @xmath20",
    ". then the solution of eq.([8 ] ) , can be written as @xmath21 as a result of the transformation ( 4)(7 ) , the hamiltonian @xmath9 takes the form @xmath22 where the energies @xmath23 in the limit @xmath20 are given by @xmath24    it is seen that the variable @xmath25 describes the motion of the guiding center whereas @xmath26 is responsible for the cyclotron motion .",
    "we search for the solution of the schrdinger equation , @xmath27 , in the form @xmath28 where @xmath29 are the eigenfunctions of the harmonic oscillator @xmath30 the coefficients @xmath31 satisfy the system of equations @xmath32 with @xmath33 defined as @xmath34    first , it can be readily seen that , since the function @xmath35 is nonzero only when both arguments are smaller than @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the radius of the impurity potential , one can take @xmath38 out of the integral at point @xmath39 .",
    "we also see that after switching to the @xmath40 variables the impurity potential became an operator .",
    "thus , to find its action on the function @xmath41 one should perform the fourier transformation @xmath42 where we again took into account that @xmath43 . as a result",
    "the differential operator @xmath44 in the argument of @xmath35 can be replaced by @xmath45 , so that the right  hand side takes the form @xmath46 now the integration over @xmath26 and @xmath47 can be easily performed using the short  range character of @xmath35 .",
    "this picks the values @xmath48 and @xmath39 and generates the factor @xmath49 . after that it is convenient to express the component @xmath50 in terms of @xmath41 using the inverse fourier transformation .",
    "finally we obtain @xmath51 where we have introduced the notations @xmath52 the paremeter @xmath53 is determined as @xmath54 in the second equality we have substituted @xmath55 using the representation ( [ 15 ] ) .",

    "the transmission coefficient for this potential is well known : @xmath57 and is independent of the number of ll .",
    "since we are interested in scattering of an electron with energy close to the center of some ll , say @xmath58 , by the saddle point potential , we can assume @xmath59 for any @xmath60 .",
    "the condition @xmath19 guarantees that @xmath61 .",
    "this means that each of eqs .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) with @xmath60 contains a big parameter @xmath62 .",

    "( [ 21 ] ) , enables us to express the constant @xmath53 in terms of only one unknown function @xmath64 @xmath65 once @xmath53 is determined , one can write a closed equation for @xmath66 @xmath67 where @xmath68 is defined as @xmath69 with @xmath70 given by @xmath71 we see that the parameter @xmath70 describes the effect of all other ll s on the motion of an electron on the level @xmath58 .",
    "it is apparent from ( [ 30 ] ) that this effect reduces to the renormalization of the scattering strength @xmath72 .",
    "important is that , since the impurity is short  range , it causes a strong local mixing of ll s so that many levels with @xmath60 contribute to the renormalization constant @xmath70 .",
    "indeed , the terms in the sum ( [ k ] ) fall off with the number of ll as @xmath73 . in the case",
    "@xmath74 all the terms in the sum ( [ k ] ) have the same sign , so , strictly speaking , the sum diverges logarithmicaly .",
    "the cutoff value of @xmath75 is determined by the following condition . for large enough numbers of ll",
    "@xmath76 is a rapidly oscillating function , the typical period of oscillations being @xmath77 .",
    "taking @xmath76 out of integral in ( [ 17 ] ) is justified only if this period is much larger than the dimensionless size of the impurity potential @xmath78 .",
    "this leads to the cutoff value @xmath79 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath80 for @xmath81 the sum in ( [ k ] ) contains both positive and negative contributions .",

    "the meaning of the functions @xmath118 and @xmath119 can be understood in the following way .",
    "it is known that without a smooth potential , a short  range impurity pulls out a state from the center of a degenerate ll and forms a bound state @xcite . in the presence of a saddle  point potential the energy position of the bound state is determined by the condition : @xmath122 . on the other hand , since the potential ( [ 2 ] ) `` bends '' the ll , the bound state becomes degenerate with the continuum of states at the ll and , thus , acquires a finite width which is described by the function @xmath123 .",
    "it is seen that @xmath123 represents the sum of two terms , which correspond to the widths associated with the outcome to the left and to the right , respectively . when the impurity is located",

    "note first that for @xmath127 and arbitrary @xmath128 the integrals @xmath129 and @xmath130 can be expressed in terms of the parabolic cylinder functions if one substitutes into ( [ iint ] ) the integral representation @xcite of @xmath131 .",
    "then one gets @xmath132 since @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is the @xmath135function , we get the following expression for @xmath136 at @xmath124 @xmath137 then the functions @xmath119 and @xmath118 take the form @xmath138 @xmath139 @xmath123",

    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath140 is as follows : @xmath141 , for @xmath142 ; @xmath143 , for @xmath144 .",
    "the energy dependence of the transmission coefficient for different amplitudes of the impurity potential , @xmath145 , is shown in fig .",

    "without an impurity , @xmath96 obeys the relation : @xmath148 which is the manifestation of the symmetry of the saddle point ( transmission of an electron with energy @xmath149 can be viewed as a reflection for an electron with energy @xmath150 ) . obviously ,",
    "when the impurity is randomly positioned around the saddle point and the sign of @xmath68 is random , this symmetry relation should hold _ on average_. indeed , it can be demonstrated that for an arbitrary position of an impurity , @xmath151 , the transmission coefficient satisfies the relation @xmath152 to prove ( [ gs ] ) , one should rewrite ( [ tg ] ) in the form @xmath153 where the functions @xmath154 and @xmath155 are defined as @xmath156 , \\\\",

    "then the rules of transformation for the functions @xmath166 , and @xmath155 are as follows : @xmath167 . using these properties , the relation ( [ gtc ] )",
    "can be easily proved .",
    "the meaning of this relation is that the transmittancy of the saddle point , averaged over the amplitude @xmath145 , position @xmath151 , and energy @xmath149 with any _ symmetric _ distribution function , is equal to @xmath168 .",
    "the averaging over @xmath149 has the meaning of averaging over the background value of the saddle point potential , @xmath169 , ( this value was set zero in ( [ 2 ] ) ) .",
    "our main observation is that for a symmetric distribution of the `` bare '' amplitudes @xmath170 , the distribution of renormalized amplitudes , @xmath171 , which are defined by eq .",
    "( [ 30 ] ) , is _",
    "asymmetric_. the origin of the asymmetry is the ll mixing .",
    "indeed , denote with @xmath172 the distribution function of @xmath170 ( we assume that @xmath173 ) . then using ( [ 30 ] ) one can easily find the distribution function of @xmath145 @xmath174 the degree of asymmetry of @xmath175 , due to the finite renormalization constant @xmath70 , is determined by the product @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the width of the distribution function @xmath178 .",
    "consider , for example , the lorentzian distribution : @xmath179 .",
    "then @xmath175 takes the form @xmath180}.\\ ] ] we see that @xmath181 is also a lorentzian , but it is centered at @xmath182 . for @xmath183 the shift of the center , @xmath184 , is relatively small as compared to the width @xmath177 .",
    "however for @xmath185 we get a narrow peak at @xmath186 with the width @xmath187 .",
    "this means that all the impurities , which were with equal probability repulsive and attractive before the renormalization , become effectively repulsive after the renormalization .",
    "the asymmetry in @xmath145 makes the average transmittancy of the saddle point smaller than @xmath168 . to demonstrate it",
    ", it is convenient to study the combination @xmath188 for the same @xmath145 .",
    "moreover , since @xmath189 , the renormalized impurity strength @xmath190 is much larger than @xmath191 , so that in calculating this combination one can expand ( [ gtc ] ) with respect to the small parameter @xmath192 . using the transformation rules for the functions @xmath193 and @xmath155 , established above , we obtain @xmath194 where @xmath195 is defined as @xmath196 we see that it is the sign of the parameter @xmath197 that determines the sign of deviation of the average transmittancy from @xmath168 .",
    "consider first the simplest case @xmath124 .",
    "then we have @xmath198 , _ im_@xmath199 and _ re_@xmath200 .",
    "hence , the parameter @xmath197 reduces to @xmath201.\\ ] ] it follows from ( [ delt ] ) that @xmath197 is positive if the condition @xmath202 is met .",
    "1 illustrates that this indeed is the case for any energy @xmath149 .",
    "as the displacement @xmath151 increases , the parameter @xmath197 falls off due to the general decay of the integrals @xmath203 .",
    "however , @xmath197 remains positive on average . the easiest way to see",
    "it is to consider the limit of large displacements : @xmath204 . in this limit @xmath129 and @xmath130",
    "acquire big phases .",
    "this results in a big phase of the function @xmath205 .",
    "consequently , _ re_@xmath155 and _ im_@xmath155 oscillate rapidly with the change of the impurity position ( roughly as @xmath206 and @xmath207 ) .",
    "thus the contributions of the first two terms in ( [ delta ] ) average out .",
    "when considering the third term , we note that @xmath208 depends only on the magnitude of the displacement ( it can be shown that @xmath209 ) , i.e. @xmath208 is constant if @xmath210 is constant .",
    "the form of the function @xmath118 depends on the angular position of the impurity when @xmath210 is fixed , but , averaged over the angular position , @xmath118 is an odd function of energy .",
    "one can check formally that @xmath211 changes sign when @xmath149 changes sign .",
    "therefore , the product @xmath212 is positive on average .",
    "thus we conclude that average @xmath197 is positive both for small and large displacements , and , consequently , the average transmittancy of the saddle point is diminished due to the impurity  induced ll mixing .",
    "in order to compensate for the reduction of the average transmittancy , the energy position of the delocalized state in a smooth potential shifts up with respect to the center of ll .",
    "let us estimate this shift ( levitation ) . denote with @xmath213 the concentration of the impurities . clearly , to produce a significant effect on the transmittancy",
    ", the impurity should be located within the interval of the order of magnetic length from the center of the saddle point ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "the probability to find such an impurity is @xmath215 .",
    "for @xmath214 we have @xmath216 in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) .",
    "thus , the magnitude of the reduction of the average transmittancy is of the order of @xmath217 . on the other hand",
    ", we have established that if an impurity is strong enough , the ll mixing renormalizes its amplitude to @xmath218 . as a result ,",
    "in the presence of impurities , the delocalized state corresponds to such an energy for which , in the absence of impurities , the average transmittancy of the saddle point exceeds @xmath168 by @xmath219 . since without an impurity the transmission coefficient @xmath220 has the energy scale @xmath221 , determined by eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) , we get the following estimate for the magnitude of the levitation @xmath222 @xmath223 it is instructive to compare the levitation with the spacing , @xmath224 , between the ll s .",
    "one gets @xmath225 where we have used the expression ( [ kaa ] ) for @xmath70 . in our consideration",
    "we have assumed that there is only a single impurity near the the saddle point , which implies that @xmath226 .",
    "we have also assumed that @xmath227 .",
    "then the above estimate shows that under the assumptions adopted the relative levitation is small .",
    "it also shows that the magnetic field dependence of the levitation is @xmath228 .    in numerical simulations",
    "@xcite the authors restricted the study to the two lowest ll s .",
    "they found that , due to the ll mixing , the lower ds shifts up whereas the upper ds shifts down in energy ( `` attraction '' of ds s ) .",
    "our result is consistent with this observation .",
    "indeed , if only two ll s are considered , the renormalization constant , @xmath70 , would be positive for the lower level and negative for the upper level .",
    "note in conclusion , that our main result ",
    "the reduction of the transmittancy due to the ll mixing , was derived in the limit of the strong renormalization of the impurity potential .",
    "the criterion for that , formulated in the previous section , is @xmath229 , @xmath177 being the typical value of the dimensionless potential @xmath170 . using eqs .",
    "( [ kaa ] ) and ( [ 20 ] ) this criterion can be rewritten in terms of the `` bare '' amplitude and size of the impurity potential as @xmath230 . on the other hand , in our approach",
    "we have treated the impurity as point ",
    "like @xcite and , thus , neglected the change of the electron wave function within the radius @xmath36 .",
    "this is justified if the condition @xmath231 is met .",
    "the second condition seems to restict the validity of the theory to the region @xmath232 .",
    "it appears , however , that the condition @xmath233 is not relevant .",
    "we address this question in the appendix and show that as soon as @xmath234 , it renormalizes to @xmath235  ( which is equivalent to @xmath236 ) , as we have assumed .",
    "since the presence of the saddle  point potential is not important for the renormalization procedure , we will trace the renormalization for the case when @xmath169 is absent . in this case",
    "the effect of an impurity is just the formation of the bound states which split off the ll s . in the symmetric gauge with an impurity at the origin",
    ", the schrdinger equation allows the separation of variables .",

    "then the bohr - sommerfeld condition for the energy levels , @xmath239 , reads @xmath240 where @xmath241 is an additional phase shift acquired at the origin ( @xmath242 for @xmath56 ) .",
    "this shift should be found by matching the solutions at @xmath243 and at @xmath244 .",
    "important is that for large @xmath245 the magnetic potential , @xmath246 , in ( [ a1 ] ) comes into play only at large @xmath247 . for smaller @xmath248",
