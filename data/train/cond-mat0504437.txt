    "sedimentation in a suspension of colloidal particles is of profound fundamental importance , and has been studied in detail for a long time . for instance , in 1910 perrin determined the boltzmann constant @xmath0 ( and from this avogadro s number ) by comparing the measured equilibrium density profile of a dilute suspension with the theoretically predicted barometric law @xcite , and more recently the full hard - sphere equation of state was determined accurately from a single measurement of the sedimentation profile of a dense suspension of colloidal hard spheres @xcite . in rather dilute suspensions of charged colloids , however , strong deviations from the barometric distribution have recently been theoretically predicted @xcite , experimentally observed @xcite , and simulated @xcite , at least in the regime of extremely low salinity .",
    "the most striking phenomenon is that the distribution of colloids extends to much higher altitudes than is to be expected on the basis of their buoyant mass .",
    "the force that lifts the colloids against gravity is provided by an electric field that is induced by spontaneous charge separation over macroscopic distances .",
    "the corresponding cost of electrostatic and gravitational energy is more than compensated by the gain of translational entropy of the salt ions , which are distributed much more homogeneously than when they would have had to follow the colloids to the bottom part of the suspension .",
    "the same entropy - induced lifting force was recently found to be responsible for a so - called brazil - nut effect in binary mixtures of charged colloidal particles under low - salt conditions : the heavy particles can reside at higher altitudes than the lighter ones @xcite . in this letter",
    "we extend the theoretical study of sedimentation of charged colloids to binary , ternary , and polydisperse mixtures , for which we calculate colloidal density profiles and the entropy - induced electric field selfconsistently within a poisson - boltzmann like density functional theory .",
    "we consider an @xmath1-component suspension of negatively charged colloidal spheres in a salt solution in the earth s gravity field .",
    "we label the colloidal species by @xmath2 , and denote the electric charge , diameter , and buoyant mass for species @xmath3 by @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 , respectively , where @xmath7 is the proton charge .",
    "we imagine the suspension to be in thermal and osmotic contact with a reservoir that contains monovalent ions at a concentration @xmath8 and a solvent with dielectric constant @xmath9 at temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the ions are assumed to be massless point particles with charge @xmath11 , and the solvent mass density is taken into account by considering the buoyant instead of the actual colloidal masses according to archimedes .",
    "the volume of the suspension is @xmath12 , with @xmath13 the ( macroscopic ) horizontal area and @xmath14 the vertical height of the solvent meniscus above the bottom of the system .",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath15 is in the negative vertical direction .",
    "we are interested in the equilibrium colloidal density profiles @xmath16 as a function of the altitude @xmath17 above the bottom at @xmath18 and below the meniscus at @xmath19 .",
    "the ion density profiles are denoted by @xmath20 . in order to calculate these profiles",
    "we employ the framework of density functional theory @xcite , where the equilibrium density profiles follow from the minimisation of a grand potential functional @xmath21 $ ] with respect to all the profiles . here",
    "we employ the mean - field free energy functional that consists of entropic , gravitational , and electrostatic contributions , @xmath22 where we introduced the fugacity ( or activity ) @xmath23 and the gravitational length @xmath24 of species @xmath3 , the bjerrum length @xmath25 , and the local charge density @xmath26 .",
    "the electrostatic term follows from an in - plane integration of the three - dimensional coulomb law , @xmath27 with @xmath28 the in - plane distance , where we ignored an irrelevant integration constant .",
    "the functional ( [ fml : n ] ) only couples the total charge density at different heights in a mean - field fashion , i.e. electric double layers and many other correlation effect are not taken into account .",
    "in fact one easily checks that the thermodynamics of the system reduces in the absence of gravity to an @xmath29-component ideal - gas mixture , since then @xmath30 because of translational invariance and charge neutrality . in the presence of gravity , however , interesting structures already appear at this relatively low level of sophistication . the euler - lagrange equations @xmath31 and @xmath32 that must be satisfied by the the equilibrium density profiles can be cast in the form @xmath33 ; \\label{fml : rhoa}\\\\ \\rho_i(x)&=&a_i\\exp[-x / l_i+z_i\\phi(x ) ] ; \\hspace{1cm}(i=1,2,\\cdots , n)\\label{fml : rhoi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the dimensionless electrostatic potential gauged such that it is zero in the reservoir where @xmath30 .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to rewrite it in differential form as the poisson - boltzmann equation @xmath35 here we used eq.([fml : rhoa ] ) , and we defined the reservoir screening constant @xmath36 . together with the boundary conditions @xmath37 ( where a prime denotes a derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 ) the eqs.([fml : rhoi ] ) and ( [ fml : pb ] ) form a closed set of @xmath38 equations that can in principle be solved to yield @xmath16 and @xmath39 for a given thermodynamic state determined by the reservoir characteristics @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and by the colloidal fugacities @xmath23 , gravitational lengths @xmath42 , and charges @xmath43 . in an experimental situation , however , the total packing fraction @xmath44 of species @xmath3 is usually fixed instead of the fugacity @xmath23 , with @xmath45 the number of colloids of species @xmath3 .",
    "this conversion can easily be accomplished here by regarding the fugacities @xmath23 as normalization constants that take values such that @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the local packing fraction of species @xmath3 .",
    "note that the hard - core diameters @xmath5 do not appear at all in the euler - lagrange equations , since the functional ( [ fml : n ] ) ignores the hard - core part of the ( direct ) correlations ; we use for all colloidal species that @xmath48 nm only to be able to convert densities to physically reasonable packing fractions .",
    "once the profiles @xmath39 and @xmath16 are known , then @xmath20 follows from eq.([fml : rhoa ] ) , and from this the total charge density @xmath49 .",
    "the magnitude of the electric field is given by @xmath50 , where the prime denotes a derivative w.r.t .",
    "the height @xmath17 .",
    "unfortunately one can not solve eqs.([fml : rhoi ] ) and ( [ fml : pb ] ) analytically .",
    "however , its one - dimensional character allows for a rather straightforward numerical solution on a grid @xmath51 of heights , although some care must be taken in dealing with the widely different length scales @xmath14 ( say of the order of centimeters ) and @xmath52 ( at most of the order of microns ) in realistic cases . in all our calculations we use a non - equidistant grid that we adapt to the situation at hand , making sure that it is fine enough to exclude numerical artifacts .",
    "typically we use 600 grid points for a system with a meniscus at @xmath53 cm . our iterative scheme to solve eqs.([fml : rhoi ] ) and",
    "( [ fml : pb ] ) on the grid takes typically a few seconds on a desktop pc for @xmath54 , and a minute for @xmath55 .    before discussing our numerical results",
    ", we wish to point out that the present theory reduces , for @xmath54 , to the treatment of ref.@xcite .",
    "for instance , the three regimes for the colloidal density profile ( barometric , linear , and exponential with a large decay length ) follow within the assumption of local charge neutrality @xmath56 , i.e. @xmath57 . in the linear regime ,",
    "where @xmath58 , the potential is then from eq.([fml : pb ] ) linear in @xmath17 , with a slope @xmath59 that is proportional to the electric field that lifts the colloids against gravity @xcite .",
    "this one - component result already hints at an important complication for mixtures ( @xmath60 : since generally @xmath61 a single electric field strength can not lift all the colloidal species simultaneously . on this basis",
    "one could therefore already expect segregation in mixtures , such that colloids with the same value @xmath62 ( i.e. the same charge - per - mass ) are found at the same height .",
    "this is indeed what our numerical results will show below .",
    "we start our numerical investigation with a class of binary mixtures ( @xmath63 ) of equal - sized light ( @xmath64 ) and heavy ( @xmath65 ) colloidal particles of various charge ratios .",
    "we choose the system parameters identical to those of the monte carlo simulations of figure 3 of ref.@xcite : @xmath66 nm , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 varies between 15 and 45 .",
    "the simulated system does not contain added salt but only counterions , which we can represent within our theory by the extremely low reservoir salt concentration @xmath73 nm , which we checked to be low enough to be in the zero - added - salt limit as regards the colloidal profiles . in fig.1(a ) we show , for @xmath74 , the density profiles of the two colloidal species , as well as that of the counterions ( and the coions ) in the inset .",
    "we observe profound colloidal segregation into two layers , with the heavy species floating on top of the lighter ones .",
    "the counterions are seen to be distributed throughout the whole volume , i.e. much more homogeneously than when all colloids would have been barometrically distributed in a thin layer of thickness @xmath75 just above the bottom ( since in that case the net ion charge would have been located in that same thin layer ) .",
    "the resulting gain of ion entropy is the driving force for the formation of the electric field that pushes the heavy ( highly charged ) colloids to high altitudes against gravity @xcite . in fig.1(b ) we show the mean height @xmath76 of species @xmath3 , defined as @xmath77 as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "we replot the monte carlo simulation results of figure 3 of ref.@xcite ( symbols ) , together with the predictions for @xmath76 that follow from the present theory ( continuous curves ) .",
    "given that there is not a single fit parameter involved , the agreement is remarkable , certainly when compared with the theoretical analysis on the basis exponentially decaying density profiles as in ref.@xcite .",
    "fig.1 shows that the heavy particles are on top of the lighter ones , @xmath78 , provided @xmath79 , a phenomenon that was termed the `` colloidal brazil nut effect '' in ref.@xcite . for barometric profiles one would find that @xmath80 , but we see in all cases that @xmath81 due to the lift effect of the induced electric field .",
    "the good agreement between theory and simulation in fig.1(b ) also indicates that hard - core effects ( which are taken into account in the simulations but _ not _ in the theory ) are not so relevant , at least not in the parameter regime studied here .",
    "the next system we study is a ternary system ( @xmath82 ) in a solvent characterised by @xmath83 nm ( ethanol at room temperature ) with a reservoir salt concentration @xmath84 m and meniscus height @xmath53 cm .",
    "the colloidal charges and gravitational lengths are @xmath85 and @xmath86 mm , respectively , and the system is equimolar with @xmath87 for all three species ( recall that all species have the same diameter @xmath66 nm ) .",
    "2 shows the density profiles as predicted by the present theory in ( a ) , as well as the electric field in ( b ) .",
    "we find almost perfect segregation into three layers , such that the mean heights satisfy @xmath88 .",
    "note that this ordering coincides with the ordering @xmath89 , and _ not _ with the corresponding ordering of @xmath42 which one would expect on the basis of a barometric distribution .",
    "in other words , this system segregates according to mass - per - charge instead of the more usual ordering according to mass : the colloids with the largest mass - per - charge are found at the bottom . in the present case this implies that the lightest colloids ( species 2 ) are found in a layer in between the equally heavy species 1 and 3 .",
    "on the basis of the one - component theory of ref.@xcite one would expect a linearly decaying density profile of species @xmath3 in the layer where species @xmath3 is dominant , as well as a linear electrostatic potential . denoting the derivative w.r.t .",
    "@xmath17 by a prime , the one - component theory predicts @xmath90 and @xmath91 in the layer with species @xmath3 , corresponding to an electric field strength @xmath92 in this layer .",
    "these values for the density gradients and the electric field are indicated in fig.2(a ) and ( b ) , respectively , and are in good agreement with the numerical results . the result for the electric field",
    "can also be easily obtained analytically for a mixture provided one assumes that segregation takes place , such that @xmath16 takes a maximum at some height @xmath93 in the layer of species @xmath3 . from @xmath94",
    "one obtains from eq.([fml : rhoi ] ) that @xmath95 , in agreement with the numerical results .",
    "the inset of fig.2(b ) shows the ratio of the total charge density @xmath49 and the ion charge density @xmath96 , which is such that @xmath97 for all @xmath17 except close to @xmath18 and @xmath19 where it is @xmath98 .",
    "this indicates that the system , with its inhomogeneous electric field , is yet essentially locally charge neutral ( but not exactly , and not at all at the boundaries ) , suggesting that a description on the basis of hydrostatic equilibrium within a local density approximation should be rather accurate @xcite .",
    "we now extend our study to polydisperse mixtures , where one could expect segregation into many layers on the basis of the results for two and three components .",
    "we mimic the polydispersity by considering a system of @xmath55 components , with @xmath43 distributed as a gaussian with average of @xmath99 and a standard deviation of 50 .",
    "this distribution is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) , where the vertical axis ( @xmath100 ) is proportional to the relative frequency of species @xmath3 in the sample .",
    "we consider two distributions for @xmath42 : ( a ) @xmath101 mm for all species , and ( b ) @xmath102 mm .",
    "case b mimics the situation for spheres of different size but the same mass density and surface charge density , such that @xmath43 is proportional to the surface area and @xmath42 to the inverse volume of species @xmath3 , i.e. @xmath103 is a constant independent if @xmath3 .",
    "the density profiles , numerically obtained by solving the eqs.([fml : rhoi ] ) and ( [ fml : pb ] ) for @xmath53 cm , @xmath83 nm , @xmath104 m , and @xmath105 , are shown in fig.3 for all 21 components .",
    "case a shows profound lifting and layering , where the ordering is again determined by mass - per - charge as illustrated by the three dashed curves ( for @xmath106 , 279 , and 299 ) showing that the colloids in the high - charge wing of the distribution reside at high altitudes .",
    "fig.3(b ) shows the density profiles for case b , which does exhibit lifting , but hardly any layering , and no density inversion at all .",
    "this is completely consistent with the picture that the ordering is determined by @xmath62 , which for case b is such that @xmath107 , i.e. the highly - charged particle are expected at the bottom while the relative spread in @xmath62 is relatively small compared to case a , where @xmath108 .",
    "the inset of ( b ) shows the total packing fraction profiles @xmath109 of both case a and b together with the one - component profile ( @xmath54 ) with @xmath110 and @xmath111 mm at @xmath112 .",
    "perhaps surprisingly there is hardly any distinction between the pure system and case b , whereas there is a small difference with case a. these profiles show that the main distinction between these polydisperse systems and the underlying one - component one concerns the layering phenomenon ( provided @xmath62 varies sufficiently for all the species ) , and _ not _ the total distribution of the colloids .",
    "perhaps this fractionation effect could be exploited experimentally to purify a polydisperse mixture .",
    "we have studied sedimentation equilibrium of @xmath1-component systems of charged colloidal particles at low salinity within a poisson - boltzmann - like density functional .",
    "the euler - lagrange equations that describe the minimisation of the functional are solved numerically on a one dimensional grid of heights for a number of system parameters .",
    "for @xmath54 the theory reduces to the one - component studies as presented in ref.@xcite , and for @xmath63 we quantitatively reproduce the simulation results of ref.@xcite , where density inversion was found such that the heavier colloids float on top of the lighter ones .",
    "this effect is caused by a self - consistent electric field that lifts the higher charged ( heavy ) particles to higher altitudes than the lower charged ( lighter ) colloids .",
    "we show that the layering of the colloids according to mass - per - charge can persist for ternary ( @xmath82 ) as well as for polydisperse ( here @xmath55 ) mixtures .",
    "given the good account that the present theory gives for simulations @xcite and experiments @xcite of one - component systems , and for the simulations of binary systems @xcite , it is tempting to argue that the theory is also ( qualitatively ) reliable for ternary or polydisperse systems , i.e. the predicted segregation and layering should be experimentally observable .",
    "one should bare in mind , however , that the present theory ignores the hard - core of the colloidal particles , and is therefore expected to break down at higher packing fractions .",
    "it also ignores effects due to charge renormalisation , which becomes relevant when @xmath113 .",
    "work on extending the theory in these directions is in progress @xcite .",
    "all results presented in this paper were obtained with the zero - field boundary conditions @xmath37 .",
    "we checked explicitly , however , that other boundary conditions that respect global charge neutrality , such as @xmath114 ( describing a suspension in a homogeneous external electric field @xmath115 ) or @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( describing a short - circuited bottom and meniscus ) give indistinguishable density profiles , except in two layers of thickness @xmath118 m in the vicinity of the bottom and the meniscus . this insensitivity to the boundary conditions is not surprising in the light of the fact that the whole phenomenology in these systems is driven by the entropy of the microscopic ions , i.e. a bulk contribution to the grand potential that should dominate any boundary ( surface ) contribution .",
