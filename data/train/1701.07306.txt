    "the square of opposition was expanded to the _ hexagon of opposition _ , by adding a sentence at the top and another one at the bottom of the square ( see , e.g. , figure  [ fig : hexagon ] ) .",
    "recently , the square of opposition as well as the hexagon of opposition and its extensions have been investigated from various semantic points of view ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in this paper",
