    "the miniboone experiment was designed to test the indication of a @xmath1 oscillation signal at lsnd  @xcite .",
    "miniboone data for @xmath2 appearance in a @xmath0 beam  @xcite , when restricted to the range of @xmath3 reconstructed neutrino energy , refute a simple two - neutrino oscillation interpretation for the lsnd signal .",
    "however , the results indicate an excess of signal - like events at low energy , which has persisted at the @xmath4 level after various refinements to the analysis  @xcite .",
    "first results from miniboone for @xmath5 appearance in a @xmath6 beam do not show a significant excess  @xcite , but are inconclusive with respect to the lsnd signal .    because electromagnetic showers instigated by electrons and photons are not distinguishable at miniboone , neutral current events producing single photons are an irreducible background to the charged current @xmath7 signal .",
    "this note presents flux - averaged cross sections for the dominant sources of single - photon backgrounds , some of which were not incorporated in the miniboone analysis .",
    "these standard model processes must be well - understood and accounted for before appealing to more exotic interpretations of the electron - like signal .",

    "contributions to the process of interest can be tabulated in the rigorous language of a chiral lagrangian expansion .",
    "extrapolation to moderate energy can then be performed by explicitly including the lowest - lying resonances in each channel , and adopting phenomenological form factors to mimic the effects of higher resonances .",
    "this methodology was discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "this study was motivated by the search for low - energy remnants of the baryon current anomaly , such as the coherent coupling of weak and electromagnetic currents to baryon density  @xcite - channel @xmath9 exchange ( considered in @xcite ) also receives contributions from @xmath10 and @xmath11-channel @xmath12 .",

    "there appears a term that derives from @xmath15-channel @xmath16 production and @xmath17-channel @xmath18 exchange .",
    "exchange of @xmath19 in the @xmath17-channel is naively of similar size but is suppressed by an amplitude factor @xmath20  @xcite .",

    "the @xmath12 and @xmath9 contributions are spin - independent interactions at low energy , and can also give rise to coherent scattering on compound nuclei such as @xmath23 in the miniboone detector .",

    "only the incoherent @xmath12 contribution was studied in the miniboone analysis , with normalization constrained by comparison to observed @xmath19 production and a model of final state interactions .",

    "it can also be seen from this table that the direct estimate of the number of single photon events mediated by @xmath16 is larger than the @xmath19-constrained background estimate of miniboone by a factor @xmath38  , @xmath39 and @xmath3 bins , respectively . for definiteness",

    "theoretical errors are discussed at the end of this note and have not been included in the fit . assuming a lower @xmath42 efficiency and taking the difference between the estimates of @xmath27 events from the table , the remaining excess would be @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 in the @xmath46 , @xmath39 and @xmath3 bins , respectively . if no additional incoherent @xmath27 events are included , these numbers become @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "we consider some of these , focusing on in - medium effects on the coherent cross section , and fermi motion effects on the incoherent cross section .",
    "the largest component of the coherent amplitude at low energy is due to the @xmath16 resonance in the @xmath15 channel  . to gauge whether the nuclear modeling for the coherent process mediated by @xmath12 excitation gives a reasonable approximation to the true cross section , it is useful to compare to the analog process of coherent photon scattering on the same nucleus . data from @xcite at a fixed angle @xmath52 is shown in fig .",

    "@xcite   discussed there has been neglected . ] .",
    "as the figure illustrates , the data is in better agreement with the model incorporating in - medium effects , where the cross section is somewhat reduced , and the peak shifted to smaller energy .",
    "the fit to the data can be improved by using a slightly larger vacuum width ( e.g. @xmath59 ) and including a small nonresonant background . however , these modifications are beyond the accuracy of other approximations such as the simplified nuclear form factor and nonrelativistic reduction of the amplitude .",
    "the main point to be illustrated is that the simple model represented by the dashed line is not a gross misrepresentation of the data .",
    "the incoherent single - photon cross sections have been calculated neglecting nuclear effects . from a comparison of the ccqe cross sections computed assuming free nucleons , and those using a relativistic fermi gas model , the nuclear binding , fermi motion of the initial - state nucleons , and pauli blocking of the final state nucleons , are seen to affect the cross sections on the @xmath60 level for the relevant energies .",
    "similarly , in - medium modification of parameters such as @xmath61 , @xmath62 should affect the cross sections at a @xmath63 level , as seen in the above example for coherent compton scattering , or in related analyses of single pion production through the @xmath12 resonance  .",
    "the effects of higher baryon resonances are small ( @xmath64 ) relative to @xmath16 , based on the production cross sections below @xmath65 neutrino energy  @xcite .",
    "interference effects between different photon production mechanisms ( @xmath9 , @xmath12 , compton ) have been neglected .",
    "a detailed study is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the distinct kinematic distributions  @xcite suggest that interference effects will not drastically alter the total cross sections at the energies accessible to miniboone .",
    "photons produced by rescattering of pions in the nucleus have been neglected .",
    "the range of @xmath66 is a subjective estimate of the total single - photon cross section uncertainty .",
    "a dedicated efficiency analysis would constrain the overall normalization error .",
    "examination of processes such as @xmath67 could be used to test other sources of uncertainty  .",
    "this process avoids complications from final - state pion interactions , but involves different linear combinations of the hadronic matrix elements than contribute to the neutral current process .",
    "neglected single photon events give a significant contribution to the miniboone low - energy excess",
    ". fits to the data also favor an enhanced resonant @xmath27 contribution ( either incoherent or coherent ) relative to estimates based on @xmath19 production .",
    "a similar enhancement is predicted by a phenomenological model calculation , and is consistent with the absence of a significant excess in the miniboone antineutrino results .",
