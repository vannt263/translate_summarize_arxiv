    "in addition to the non - hysteretic magnetoresistance , there is an abrupt increase in the resistance at a well defined magnetic field , known as the switching field @xmath27.@xcite this hysteretic effect is due to the rapid reversal of the nanowire s magnetization.@xcite when the nanowire is nearly perpendicular to the field , we frequently observe a splitting of the transition into two or more unequal steps .",

    "[ fig : straightmr](c ) , ( d ) and [ fig : straighte](e ) .",
    "we believe that the presence of the smaller transitions is due to slight bends in the nanowire , and a consequent shift in the switching field .",

    "the rotation sweeps also show sharp switching events that are very similar to those seen in the field sweeps discussed previously",

    "this can be understood by tracking the direction of the magnetization in the wire as it is rotated .",
    "initially ( @xmath40 ) , the wire is parallel to the field , along with the magnetization .",
    "as the wire is rotated , the strong shape anisotropy tends to make the direction of * m * rotate away from the field , tracking the wire axis .",
    "this continues as the wire rotates past perpendicular , with the magnetization becoming increasingly anti - aligned to the field . at a certain orientation ( @xmath41 ) , this anti - aligned magnetization becomes energetically unstable , and the magnetization undergoes a rapid reversal in direction to become aligned with the field .",
    "this produces the sharp increases in the resistance seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : anglesweep_straight ] . when the direction of rotation is reversed , the same behavior is observed .",

    "the size of this nucleation region is comparable to previously determined values in nanowires of smaller diameter.@xcite as noted above , @xmath32 for several of our straight nanowires have the same shape ; this indicates that the size and shape of the initial nucleation volume does not vary signficantly between wires with different lengths .",
    "to examine the energetics of the nanowire reversal process , we have developed a phenomenological model to describe the behavior of the magnetization .",
    "we begin by assuming that , except at the switching field , the direction of the magnetization is described by stoner - wolhfarth coherent rotation , @xmath63 where @xmath30 is the angle between the applied field and the wire axis , and @xmath64 is the angle between the magnetization vector and the wire axis.@xcite because the nanowire is initially being modeled as single domain , the demagnetization factors used in this calculation are derived from the geometry of the entire wire ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 ) , and not from the nucleation volume determined from the curling mode fit .",
    "the resistance is then related to the magnetization by @xmath65 . at @xmath66 , the shape anisotropy forces the magnetization to lie along the axis of the wire ( @xmath67 ) , indicating that the resistance should be maximized at zero field",

    "this implies that there is a demagnetization effect at low field that reduces the overall magnitude of * m*. a possible mechanism for this effect is that the magnetization is rotating towards the crystalline easy axis of the wire .",
    "since these nanowires are polycrystalline , there will be a distribution of these directions , resulting in a decrease in the net magnetization .    to model this behavior in the data , we assume that the s - w theory provides an accurate description of the direction of the magnetization , but that there is a spatially - uniform demagnetizing effect that reduces the magnitude . in the absence of direct data on the magnitude of the magnetization",

    "the locking occurs because the energy cost of nucleating a domain wall to enter the intermediate state ( c ) makes it energetically favorable to suppress the separate transitions and reverse the entire wire simultaneously .",
    "the locked transitions are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : bent30hsw ] and [ fig : bent90hsw ] as open triangles .",
    "an estimate for the energy cost of domain nucleation can be determined by considering the shift in the switching fields and the additional magnetostatic energy associated with that shift . for the orientations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : locking ] , this shift is approximately 35 oe .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of energy of @xmath118  erg , approximately 1% of the total energy of the nanowire .",
    "when the two segments of a bent wire are at sufficiently different angles to the field , the wire reverses its magnetization in two separate steps .",
    "there is still an energy cost for switching into the anti - aligned intermediate state , which appears as an increase in the switching field of the segment closer to parallel to the field .",
    "this can be seen most clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : bent90hsw ] for @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where the measured switching fields ( circles ) are larger than what was expected based on the straight wire results ( smooth curve ) . at higher field , the reversal of the segment closer to perpendicular to the field places the wire back into an aligned magnetization state .",
    "this is an energetically favorable transition , and in this regime , the straight wire data matches the behavior of the bent wire .    the opposite behavior is observed when the wire is in an orientation similar to the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation ] .",
    "for the @xmath11 bent wire , this occurs for @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig : bent90hsw ] .",
    "in this orientation , the low - field reversal ( of the segment more nearly parallel to the field ) places the wire in a single domain state . since there is no additional energy barrier due to the creation of a domain wall , the behavior of the bent - wire switching field",
    "is accurately predicted by the straight wires . on the other hand , the subsequent reversal of the more nearly perpendicular segment places the wire in an anti - aligned magnetization state .",
    "the cost of nucleating a wall results here in an increase in the switching field in this regime .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bent90hsw ] as a shoulder in the peaks for @xmath119 compared to the prediction from the straight wire data .",
    "it should be noted that these shifts in the switching fields for the bent nanowires can not be ascribed to differences in the lengths of the two segments .",
    "the switching field data for the series of straight nanowires shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : straighthsw](b ) indicate that there is very little variation in @xmath32 in the range of lengths studied .",
    "this range of lengths encloses the lengths of the segments of the bent nanowires studied .",
    "this implies that the changes in @xmath45 in the bent wires are not simply due to differences in the segment lengths .",
    "in addition to shifting the switching fields , the domain configuration effects can be observed directly in the magnetoresistance data .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the mr curves for a bent wire in two orientations , corresponding to those in fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation ] , with the same angles between the segments and the applied field .",
    "the magnetoresistance for one such pair of orientations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wallr](a ) . the solid curve , corresponding to the orientation in the left column of fig .",
    "[ fig : orientation ] ( `` wall '' orientation ) , has a domain wall in the region where only one segment has reversed . the dashed curve ,",
    "corresponding to the other ( `` no - wall '' ) orientation , does not have a domain wall in this region .",
    "since the angles between the segments and the field are the same , we would expect the magnetoresistances to be the same , with some differences in the switching fields due to the energetic effects discussed above .",
    "instead , there is a significant difference in the intermediate region , where only one of the segments has reversed .",
    "this is shown in more detail in fig .",
    "[ fig : wallr](b ) , which plots the differences between the two curves . the solid curve ( `` wall '' orientation ) has a lower resistance in the intermediate region , suggesting that there is a decrease in the resistance associated with the presence of a domain wall .",
    "this decrease was seen in measurements on multiple @xmath11 bent wires , with magnitudes in the range of @xmath0 , corresponding to a fractional change in the resistance of @xmath120 .",
    "we note that the bend angle needs to be near @xmath11 to allow a comparison of this sort to be made .",
    "this result is somewhat analogous to what was observed by taniyama _ et .",
    "al _ in lithographically - defined zigzag structures at lower temperatures.@xcite    resistance versus field for a @xmath11 wire with segments at @xmath121 and @xmath35 to the field .",
    "( a ) solid line is the wire in the `` wall '' orientation ( see text ) ; dashed line is wire in the `` no - wall '' orientation .",
    "( b ) difference in resistance between the two wire orientations . ]",
    "there are multiple theoretical models that include the possibility of domain walls with negative contributions to the resistance .",
    "tatara and fukuyama@xcite have proposed a mechanism based on the suppression of weak localization .",
    "using the dimensions of our nanowire in their theory gives a predicted wall resistance of @xmath122 , comparable to the measured value .",
    "however , it is unlikely that weak localization effects play a significant role at room temperature , indicating that an alternate explanation is required .",
    "van gorkom _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite have proposed a semi - classical mechanism based around differing scattering relaxation times for the majority and minority spin channels .",
    "depending on the ratio of these times , the wall resistance can be either negative or positive , with values in the range @xmath123 .",
    "this range encompasses the observed values in our nanowires , but in the absence of detailed information on the nature and density of the impurities in the nickel , we are unable to make a more precise comparison between the theory and our data .    another effect that can provide negative wall resistance is the amr contribution from the spins inside the wall itself.@xcite based on the mfm results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mfm ] , the domain wall width in the bent wires is on the order of @xmath111 . given the straight wire satuartion magnetoresistance of @xmath124 , this corresponds to a decrease in the resistance of @xmath125 , approximately one third of the decrease actually observed .",
    "thus , while it appears that amr plays a significant role in the resistance shift , it seems likely that there are other mechanisms contributing to this effect and that further investigation is necessary to determine its cause .",
    "in summary , we examined the magnetotransport properties of straight and bent ferromagnetic nanowires .",
    "it was determined that the switching behavior of the straight nanowires is consistent with the curling - mode reversal of a small volume , followed by propagation throughout the wire bulk .",
    "the bent wires showed qualitatively similar behavior , with modifications from the intersegment interactions .",
    "for both the straight and bent nanowires , the location of the switching events in @xmath28 were found to be independent of which variable was being swept .",
    "the magnetic properties of the bent wires were dependent on the domain configuration at the bend ; the energetic cost of nucleating a domain wall acts to increasd the observed switching field compared to a straight wire at equivalent orientations .",
    "there is also a change in the resistance associated with the domain configuration ; the resistance is lower when a domain wall is present .",
    "further investigation is needed to determine the mechanism of this reduction , including examination of wires of differing diameters and possible studies of the dynamics of the reversal .",
    "thus it appears that magnetic nanowires are a fruitful system for future studies of reversal dynamics and the effects of domain walls in ferromagnets .",
