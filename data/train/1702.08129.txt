    "<S> equation ( [ omegadldaffinal ] ) then simplifies to @xmath84 which is the usual hartree approximation for the interaction energy between the two planes mediated by a yukawa interaction .    </S>",

    "<S> we furthermore assume that the temperature is zero . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omegaraeff ] , we show the frequency @xmath100 as a function of the 2d-3d interaction strength @xmath101 at a fixed interlayer distance @xmath102 . </S>",

    "<S> the full frequency / momentum dependence of the 2d-3d scattering is important , and the perturbative result deviates significantly from the full strong - coupling theory . in particular , whereas the perturbative result diverges for @xmath103 , the strong - coupling theory predicts a finite frequency saturating at @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the frequency shift becomes significant for @xmath105 , which includes a region sufficiently far from unitarity so that the predicted 3-body loss is small   @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this demonstrates the usefulness of our proposal to detect mediated interactions . </S>",
    "<S> note that this result can only be obtained using a strong coupling theory , since the perturbative result is only accurate for weak interactions where the frequency shift is minute .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omegaraeff2 ] , we plot @xmath100 as a function of the ratio of the interparticle distances @xmath106 ( keeping @xmath107 fixed ) with @xmath108 and all other physical parameters the same as for fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omegaraeff].a . </S>",
    "<S> the density of the bec enters the mediated interaction in two ways , which is most clearly seen in the weak - coupling limit given by ( [ eq : yukawa ] ) : first , the strength of the interaction is proportional to @xmath27 ; second , the range of the interaction is determined by the bec coherence length @xmath109 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , increasing the density increases the strength but reduces the range of the mediated interaction , and it is not a priori obvious what the net effect on the frequency shift will be . from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : omegaraeff2 ] , we see that for the chosen parameters , @xmath93 in fact increases monotonically with increasing bec density . </S>",
    "<S> , a 2d fermion can form a bound - dimer state with a 3d boson . the frequency shift in this region </S>",
    "<S> therefore depends on whether the system forms these dimers , or whether it is on the so - called repulsive branch where the effective 2d-3d interaction is repulsive . </S>",
    "<S> this complicates the analysis , which will be presented in a future publication . ]    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions. _ we demonstrated that a mixed - dimensional setup consisting of two layers of identical fermions immersed in a 3d background gas is a powerful probe to investigate mediated interactions systematically . </S>",
    "<S> the mediated interaction between the two layers modifies the out - of - phase dipole oscillation frequency of the 2d clouds , and we calculate this shift using a strong - coupling theory taking into account the low energy scattering between the 2d and 3d particles . using this theory , we showed that for strong 2d-3d coupling , the resulting frequency shift is clearly measurable .    </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the advantages of our proposal are twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , if the 2d trapping is realized using optical potentials , the distance between planes is a few hundred nanometres , which is much larger than the range of interatomic interactions . any observed coupling between the two planes is therefore solely due to a mediated interaction via the 3d gas . </S>",
    "<S> second , the shift of the center - of - mass oscillation frequency is a very precise spectroscopic tool that can be used as a probe of weak interactions , as demonstrated recently in @xcite .    </S>",
