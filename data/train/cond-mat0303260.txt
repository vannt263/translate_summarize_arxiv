    "the mechanical properties of static bead packings remains a controversial and largely unanswered problem of granular media  @xcite .",
    "experiments and numerical simulations have thus far been unable to provide a definitive description of the propagation of stresses through rigid bead packings , in part because of the limited range of bead properties and system sizes typically considered .",
    "theory is not yet at a sufficiently advanced stage to resolve these deficiencies . first ",
    "principle approaches such as those initiated in  @xcite may eventually generate some form of ` complete ' solution , but their significant complexity has thus far ruled out easily verifiable predictions .",
    "analytically tractable theories have been devised , such as the @xmath1model  @xcite and the force ray splitting ` double y ' model  @xcite , but only after making _ ad hoc _ if intuitive assumptions regarding the local propagation of forces .",
    "an alternative approach to treating granular piles within an analytical framework is to restrict attention to a specific class of packings , but otherwise treat it as exactly as possible .",
    "frictionless spheres are an ideal test case : the smooth surfaces can not support tangential contact forces , removing indeterminacy problems that arise with frictional surfaces , and furthermore the spherical nature of the beads means that the remaining normal component must pass through the bead centre , so that the torque applied at each contact must vanish .",
    "nonetheless disordered frictionless sphere packings are far from trivial : apart from mean field  type analysis  @xcite , results obtained thus far have typically been numerical , either for small systems with arbitrary disorder  @xcite , or much larger systems within the ` approximation of small displacements ' of roux _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite ( in this context , it is perhaps also relevant to mention the large  scale simulations of breton _ et al . _",
    "on geometrically ordered packings with disorder in the contact friction  @xcite ) .    for a completely ordered lattice of frictionless discs ,",
    "all of the forces propagate along the directions of colinear bonds , and it is straightforward to write down all of the contact forces in response to a specified loading . in this paper , we expand about this ordered solution to first order in the deviations of bead radii from their mean value , and derive analytical expressions for the propagation and distribution of forces for piles of arbitrary size .",
    "this we are able to eliminate statistical noise",
    ". our findings are fully detailed in the subsequent sections , but in brief : the distribution of contact forces @xmath0 is narrow near the surface , and broadens as one moves further down the pile .",
    "this broadening is initially superdiffusive ( _ i.e. _ faster than the square root of distance from the surface ) , but crosses over to a subdiffusive regime lower down the pile and ceases to broaden precisely at the base . turning to consider the green s function problem of the response in contact forces to an isolated point load , we find that mean of this response is concentrated along a ` cone ' extending downwards from the point source along lines of contacts . although the response inside the cone averages to zero , the variance in the fluctuations under ensemble averaging can be calculated , and is found to depend purely on the height , not ( as might be expected ) the distance from edge of the cone .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",

    "[ s : greens ] the response to an isolated load is found , including its statistical properties under ensemble averaging . finally , in sec .",
    "[ s : disc ] we summarise and suggest possible ways in which the analytical framework presented here might be extended .",
    "we remark that our approach is similar in spirit to roux _",
    "s ` assumption of small displacements , ' although here were consider low  density packings for which the disorder can not make or break contacts .",
    "in fact , it is essentially the small  polydispersity of the adaptive network algorithm of tkachenko and witten  @xcite , treated analytically rather than numerically .",
    "here we specify the class of granular packings under consideration in this paper , as well as the reasons for their analytically tractability .",
    "firstly , we consider packings that are marginally rigid or _ isostatic _",
    "@xcite , _ i.e. _ the number of ( scalar ) constraints imposed by the conditions of force and torque balance on each bead equals the number of degrees of freedom in the contact forces .",
    "then the force network can be determined purely from the requirements of local force and torque balance , without reference to the deformation properties of the beads .",
    "also , since both the force and torque balance equations are linear , the full contact network can be found by simply summing the forces propagating from each loaded bead .",
    "secondly , our packings are constructed from _ frictionless _ beads , so that only the normal components of the contact forces are non  zero .",
    "this means that the direction of the contact forces can be uniquely determined from the geometry .",
    "furthermore we use _ spherical _ beads , so that these contact forces point through the bead centres and all torques trivially vanish .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the isostatic limit for such packings .",
    "if the mean number of contacts per bead is @xmath2 , this represent @xmath3 degrees of freedom in the ( normal ) contact forces , and @xmath4 constraints imposed by force balance in a @xmath4dimensional system .",
    "thus the isostatic limit for frictionless spheres has @xmath5 .",
    "thirdly , we suppose that the beads are _ almost monodisperse _ in size , _",
    "i.e. _ the bead radii are narrowly distributed about some mean value .",
    "then the contact topology will be the same as for a completely ordered system . since @xmath5 everywhere , the load on any one bead can be uniquely decomposed into the @xmath4 contact forces of the two lower beads ( assuming there are no horizontal contacts ) . in this manner",
    "the forces due to external loads will propagate downwards through the system until reaching the fixed base  @xcite .",
    "finally , the packing is formed by the",
    "_ sequential deposition _ of beads to the upper surface , and ensuring mechanical stability between each addition .",
    "this exploits a happy coincidence of numbers : for @xmath5 packing , each incoming bead will rest on @xmath4 others , which is also the number of contacts required to determine the position of the added bead .",
    "thus the geometry of the pile can be found without needing to know the incoming bead trajectories .",
    "in this section , the position vectors of the beads for a particular set of bead radii is derived for the @xmath6 case of frictionless discs . an assumption underlying",
    "the analysis throughout this paper is that all of the contact forces are compressive .",
    "this is crucial , since granular particles are typically regarded as non  cohesive and therefore can not support tensile contacts .",
    "it is clear that such a state must exist if the disorder is sufficiently small , since all contact forces are compressive in the corresponding ordered limit  @xcite .",
    "the range of validity of this assumption will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : force_diffusion ] after the force distribution has been found .",
    "[ s : geometry ]    before considering the near  crystalline packing , it is useful to describe the completely ordered case , both as reference and to fix the notation",

    "each bead has radius @xmath7 and is located at a lattice site @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 refer to the horizontal and vertically  upwards lattice directions , respectively .",
    "the centre of the bead at @xmath8 is denoted by the position vector @xmath11 , where    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 are the unit base lattice vectors in the upwards  right ( @xmath14 ) and upwards  left ( @xmath15 ) directions .",
    "it is straightforward to show that @xmath16 with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the horizontal distance between bead centres .",
    "each bead makes @xmath19 contacts with beads aligned along the lattice diagonals , _",
    "i.e. _ bead @xmath8 touches beads @xmath20 .",
    "thus only sites with @xmath21 even are occupied .",
    "the requirement that beads can not overlap in either the horizontal or vertical directions fixes @xmath18 to be in the range @xmath22 .",
    "disorder is introduced into the packing by assigning each bead a radius @xmath23 prior to deposition onto lattice site @xmath8 , where the @xmath24 are random variables drawn from a distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath25 . when a bead is added to the growing surface",
    ", its centre @xmath26 must be chosen to ensure the distance to both supporting beads is equal to the sum of the corresponding radii ; to first order in the @xmath24 , this gives    @xmath27    where @xmath28 are the reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath29 , _ i.e. _ vectors @xmath28 such that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "we now fix the lower boundary condition to be that the centres of all beads in the base @xmath32 have the same height and are uniformly spread horizontally : @xmath33 , just as in the ordered case .",
    "then ( [ e : disp ] ) can be extrapolated to @xmath32 _ via _ an induction process to give the perturbed bead positions purely in terms of the @xmath24 ,    @xmath34    thus the position of the bead at @xmath8 depends on @xmath24 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and so on , _",
    "i.e. _ only on the @xmath24 lying along the two diagonals stretching from @xmath8 to the base , hereafter referred to as the ` cone . ' note that ( [ e : delta_x_ij ] ) ignores any horizontal boundaries , and is therefore valid for infinitely wide ` slabs ' and systems with periodic boundaries at @xmath37 with @xmath38 , where @xmath39 denotes the maximum height of the packing .",
    "we can now describe the manner in which the geometric disorder propagates upwards from the base . for @xmath40 , the expression ( [ e : delta_x_ij ] )",
    "is dominated by the two sums .",
    "thus , to good approximation , the coefficients of both the @xmath41 and @xmath42 components of @xmath43 are the sum of @xmath10 independent random variables @xmath44 .",
    "each such term has a variance @xmath45 , and so the combined variance is @xmath46 .",
    "therefore the @xmath47 and @xmath48components of @xmath43 will both broaden like @xmath49 , _",

    "consider the force propagating from a vertical load @xmath58 applied to a single bead @xmath59 . if the packing were ordered , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath60 everywhere , @xmath61 would first split equally into both of the bead s supporting contacts , and then propagate unaltered along colinear bonds to the fixed base . with disorder @xmath62 ,",
    "there are two differences : not only is @xmath61 shared unequally by the two contacts ( which now generally have different directions ) , but also the propagation to the base is no longer linear but multiply branched .",
    "a qualitative description of the following analysis can be found in  @xcite for close  packed 3d crystals .",
    "let @xmath63 denote the magnitude of the contact force from @xmath8 to @xmath64 , using the convention that compressive contacts have positive @xmath63 .",
    "the force balance equation for the loaded bead @xmath59 is then    @xmath65    by writing @xmath61 as @xmath66 , the supporting forces can be evaluated to first order in the @xmath67 ,    @xmath68    using @xmath69 .",
    "the range of allowed @xmath18 given in sec .",
    "[ s : geometry ] means that @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 and the denominators in ( [ e : split ] ) never diverge .",
    "once the two contact forces @xmath72 are known , it is necessary to calculate how they propagate to the fixed base .",
    "this is done by the same force balance equation as ( [ e : force_balance ] ) but with @xmath61 replaced by the corresponding incoming contact force .",
    "for instance , the force @xmath73 coming into a bead @xmath74 along the @xmath75 direction is balanced by the two supporting contacts @xmath76 , which to order @xmath77 are    @xmath78    the expressions for the contributions from @xmath79 follow from symmetry . thus the contribution of each contact force of the loaded bead @xmath80 to any contact @xmath63 in the system , if any , can be found by summing over all downward  propagating paths from @xmath59 to @xmath8 , and applying ( [ e : propagate ] ) for each step .",
    "this process is simplified by the observation that the `` branching '' force @xmath81 in ( [ e : propagate ] ) is @xmath77 to leading order , and thus only paths with 0 or 1 branch point need to be considered within this first order calculation .    without loss of generality",
    "we now consider the propagation of the @xmath82 forces ; the equivalent @xmath83 results follow from symmetry .",
    "suppose a contact @xmath84 lower down the packing obeys @xmath85 , so that it is connected to @xmath82 along a straight path with no branches .",
    "then ( [ e : propagate ] ) can be applied iteratively to give    @xmath86    only the @xmath87 at each end of the path contribute : the intermediate terms cancel , to first order .",
    "contacts @xmath88 with the opposite orientation may still receive a contribution from @xmath89 if a path with precisely one branch point connects the two bonds .",
    "this happens if @xmath90 $ ] obeys @xmath91 , in which case the branch point is at bead @xmath92 . as the branch is @xmath77 to leading order ,",
    "only the zeroth order contributions from the remaining propagation terms are required , giving    @xmath93    all other @xmath63 receive zero contribution .",
    "thus the contribution to any contact force @xmath63 due to the load @xmath61 applied to @xmath59 can be found by combining the expressions ( [ e : split ] ) , ( [ e : unidirn ] ) and ( [ e : kink ] ) .",
    "when a specified load is applied to the pile , the total contribution to any contact force @xmath63 in the packing can be found by applying the results of sec .",
    "[ s : point_load ] to each loaded bead , and summing .",
    "the distribution of contact forces @xmath0 can then be found by either averaging over all contacts with the same height , or by ensemble averaging over different packings @xmath94 ; for the loads considered here , which do not vary with horizontal distance , the final result is the same .",
    "two alternative loadings are analysed : a _ surface _",
    "load @xmath58 applied to all beads at @xmath39 with all other beads weightless ; and a _ bulk _ load in which each bead has a weight @xmath95 .",
    "only the first case will be treated in detail here ; the results of the qualitatively  similar bulk loading will be simply stated at the end .",
    "each contact @xmath84 will have contributions from the surface bead @xmath96 according to the unidirectional propagator ( [ e : unidirn ] ) , plus another @xmath97 contributions from beads in the range @xmath98 to @xmath99 which branch once according to ( [ e : kink ] ) . including the initial splitting of @xmath61 at the surface  ( [ e : split ] ) ,",
    "the final expression for @xmath84 is    @xmath100    in principle , it is possible to write this expression in terms of the @xmath24 ; however , this soon becomes messy due to the proliferation of terms .",
    "instead we now assume that @xmath101 , so that @xmath8 is ` sufficiently ' below the surface . in this limit ,",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ e : f_total ] ) is much smaller than the sum and can therefore be dropped ( recall that @xmath102 ) .",
    "furthermore , the sum itself will be dominated by terms with @xmath103 , so we need only consider @xmath104 with @xmath105 .",
    "this means that the sum terms in the expressions for @xmath106 ( [ e : delta_n_plus],[e : delta_n_minus ] ) will dominate and the remaining terms can be dropped . combining these approximations , @xmath107 can be written purely in terms of combinations of @xmath108 like @xmath109 ,    @xmath110    @xmath111    since the mean of each @xmath112 is zero , we can immediately see that the mean force @xmath113 for all heights . also , since the @xmath114 are independent for each value of  @xmath115 , then @xmath107 is the sum of a number of independent random variables , each of which has a weighting of no more than @xmath116 of the total .",
    "hence the central limit theorem applies , and , assuming that the variance of bead radii @xmath25 is finite , the distribution of contact forces must be gaussian .",
    "the variance of forces @xmath117 depends on the height @xmath10 and can be found by standard techniques , given the weightings of the @xmath114 shown in  ( [ e : delta ] ) .",
    "noting that the variance of @xmath112 is @xmath118 , we finally find that    @xmath119    where @xmath120 . a graphical representation of this solution is given in fig .",
    "[ f : schematic ] .",
    "this should be compared with the brownian expectation @xmath121 , as seen in _",
    "e.g. _ the @xmath1model  @xcite .",
    "not only is ( [ e : surface_diffusion ] ) superdiffusive near the surface , @xmath122 , the prefactor depends on @xmath123 , _",
    "i.e. _ the depth of the pile is ` felt ' at the surface , no matter how large @xmath123 is .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the degree of geometric disorder at the surface always depends on @xmath123 in these near  crystalline packings ; for more disordered systems , it would most likely saturate at some finite height and the @xmath123dependence near the surface would vanish .",
    "also note that the expression ( [ e : surface_diffusion ] ) becomes subdiffusive nearer the base , and ceases to broaden precisely at @xmath32 .",
    "this is because the geometric disorder vanishes at the base , so that the forces no longer diffuse . to check the assumptions leading to ( [ e : surface_diffusion ] ) , we compare it to data obtained from the adaptive network algorithm  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ f : sims ] .",
    "the agreement is good , and appears to improve as @xmath123 is increased .    for a bulk loaded system",
    ", the above calculations can be repeated in a similar manner .",
    "the main difference is that the mean force now varies with depth , @xmath124 .",
    "nonetheless , the variance normalised by the mean force for each depth takes a similar form ,    @xmath125    the right hand side of this expression reaches a maximum at finite height @xmath126 , and then _ narrows _ slightly towards to the base .",
    "this is because the diffusion of forces decreases near the base , as mentioned above , but the mean force ( to which the distribution is normalised ) increases linearly with @xmath127 , which acts to narrow the distribution .",
    "if the distribution was _ not _ normalised to @xmath128 , then it would broaden monotonically and again cease to broaden just at the base , for the same reasons as the surface loading case .",
    "we can now discuss the range of validity of the assumptions made earlier .",
    "the magnitude of the displaced bead centres @xmath43 typically vary as @xmath129 , which will be similar to the bead radii @xmath7 , and hence violate the assumed contact topology , for piles of height @xmath130 $ ] and greater ( this assumes that the gaps between beads in the ordered packing are also @xmath131 ) .",
    "however , the assumption of non  tensile contacts will be violated much sooner . for both surface and bulk loading , @xmath132 averaged over the system has the same general form    @xmath133    thus a finite fraction of forces will become negative for packings of height @xmath134 $ ] , and the above analysis only holds for @xmath135 .",
    "note that this is significantly smaller than if the forces diffusion in a brownian manner @xmath136 .",
    "strictly speaking , we should really require that a vanishing _",
    "number _ of contact forces are negative rather than a vanishing fraction , which would give a much lower @xmath137 . however , this is most likely too restrictive , unless it could be shown that _",
    "e.g. _ a single negative force initiates a cascade of rearrangements that alters the forces throughout a finite fraction of the system .",
    "the various phenomenological theories for granular stress propagation differ most markedly in the response green s function to an isolated load  @xcite .",
    "this can be calculated for our system as follows : apply a load @xmath138 to bead @xmath59 , and measure the vertical component @xmath139 of the induced force at a contact @xmath63 .",
    "this can be found for a given packing @xmath94 using the results given above . now _",
    "average over different packing realisations , _",
    "i.e. _ uncorrelated sets of @xmath94 with the same variance @xmath25 . since this is a first  order calculation , the mean response will be as the ordered case , so that @xmath140 will be zero except along the cone propagating downwards from @xmath59 .",
    "however , although the response outside this cone is strictly zero , the response inside the cone only vanishes after averaging : it will be positive or negative for each particular packing .",
    "the variance of the distribution of @xmath139 between different realisations can be calculated using a similar procedure to that given in sec .",
    "[ s : force_diffusion ] ,    @xmath141    a schematic representation of this solution is given in fig .",
    "[ f : greens ] . interestingly , this does _ not _ decay away from the edges of the cone , as predicted by phenomenological approaches , and in fact is completely independent of the horizontal position , depending only on the combined heights @xmath142 and  @xmath10 .",
    "the counterpart to ensemble averaging is coarse graining , _",
    "i.e. _ applying a uniform pressure to a group of @xmath143 beads , and jointly taking @xmath143 and @xmath10 to infinity in a suitable manner to give a continuum result .",
    "however , for our packings this will just give a zero response everywhere except along the edge of the cone .",
    "this is because we have only expanded around the ordered solution to first order , which will always give the zero  th order , ordered result after any form of averaging . extending these calculations to second order will introduce quadratic terms that do not vanish under averaging , and thus would allow a direct comparison between different types of averaging .",
    "in summary , we have obtained analytical expressions for contact forces in isostatic packings of frictionless discs in the nearly  ordered limit . these explicitly demonstrate the anomalous broadening of the distribution of forces @xmath0 with increasing depth , and the unusual response green s function",
    ", whose magnitude of fluctuations under ensemble averaging depends only on the vertical coordinate .",
    "we see no reason in principle why these findings could not be tested experimentally , as long as a sufficiently monodisperse sample of smooth beads could be found .",
    "indeed , this may be the main problem : glass bead experiments with a low  polydispersity of sizes placed in close ",
    "packed crystalline configurations have shown that @xmath0 already has a broad exponential @xmath0 at the base  @xcite , as opposed to the gaussian form predicted here .",
    "this suggests that even these carefully controlled experiments are already too disordered to see the first  order results predicted here .",
    "it is hoped that the calculations presented in this paper may lay the foundations for a more complete , analytically ",
    "tractable theory of bead packings that would complement current approaches .",
    "thus it is worth discussing in what ways these calculations may be extended to more realistic situations .",
    "there should be little problem in going to 3 dimensions , or for considering loads at an angle to the vertical , which would allow the piles to be sheared .",
    "perhaps more interesting would be to expand about the ordered solution to second order in the @xmath24 , rather than just to first order as considered here .",
    "this would allow the mean force to deviate from the crystalline solution for the first time , and hence allow the nature of force propagation in granular packings to be addressed from within an analytical framework ; for instance , it would be possible to see if proposed relationships between the components of the stress tensor are valid  @xcite .",
    "it would also show if reaching the continuum limit by ensemble averaging differs from coarse graining , as already discussed in sec .",
    "[ s : greens ] .",
    "however , extending this analysis to frictional beads is likely to be more troublesome .",
    "the marginal rigidity state for beads with infinite friction has @xmath144 in 2 dimensions , so that sequentially deposited beads will make either 1 or 2 contacts on the surface  in the case of 1 contact , it is not possible to determine the rest position of the incoming bead .",
    "thus groups of beads must be added simultaneously , so that the final geometry will depend on incoming bead trajectories and their material properties .",
    "also , with @xmath144 it is not possible to uniquely decompose the load applied to any given bead along paths connecting it to the base , for either the normal or tangential contact forces .",
    "instead loops , and also paths leading to the surface , will inevitably arise .",
    "this non  unique decomposition will also be a problem for frictionless non  spherical beads , for which @xmath145 in 2 dimensions .",
    "it is not clear how these problems may be surmounted without resorting to _ ad hoc _ assumptions or simplifications .",

    "start from the ordered packing , for which every contact force is known to be finite and compressive . now increase the polydispersity of bead radii continuously from zero . since the contact forces will also vary continuously ( for systems of finite size ) , they must remain compressive for some finite range of polydispersity ."
