    "maxwell s equations , the successful theory of classical electromagnetic mechanical , have a fundamental prediction that all electromagnetic radiation propagate in vacuum at the constant speed @xmath4 , independent of frequency of the wave .",
    "this is also adopted as the second postulate of einstein s theory of special relativity . as a result",
    ", the rest mass of the photon , the fundamental quanta of electromagnetic fields , should be strictly zero .",
    "testing the correctness of this prediction is one of the most intriguing tasks in modern physics .",
    "it is closely related to many fundamental questions such as charge conservation and quantization , the possibility of charged black holes , etc .",
    "@xcite , and hence , the need to push its verification as far as possible .",
    "according to the uncertainty principle , it is impossible to do any experiment that would firmly establish that the photon rest mass is exactly zero .",
    "the ultimate upper limit on the photon rest mass would be @xmath5 , when the age of the universe ( @xmath6 years ) is used .    from the theoretical point of view",
    ", a nonzero photon mass could be accommodated in a unique way by changing the inhomogeneous maxwell s equations to the proca equations @xcite .",
    "gauge invariance is replaced by the lorentz gauge , so that a mass term can be added to the lagrangian density for the electromagnetic field by invoking a characteristic length associated with the photon rest mass , @xmath7 , to describe the effective range of the electromagnetic interaction @xcite . in this case , the electric and magnetic potentials themselves have a physical significance , not just through their derivatives , which would lead to far - reaching implications .",
    "for instance , the speed of light in free space would depend on its frequency , longitudinal electromagnetic waves could exist , magnetic dipole fields would suffer more rapid fall - off with distance due to the addition of a yukawa component to the magnetic potential , and so on .",
    "all of these effects have been employed to derive increasingly restrictive constraints on the photon rest mass , either through laboratory experiments or astrophysical and cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "the most direct method of constraining the photon mass is to detect a possible frequency dependence of the speed of light .",
    "when the laboratory conditions eventually impose a limit , astronomical events afford the best opportunity for obtaining higher precision measurements on the relative speed of electromagnetic radiation at different wavelengths .",
    "the first attempt that took advantage of astronomical distances was the comparison of the arrival time of optical and radio emission from flare stars @xcite , with a constraint on the photon mass of @xmath8 g. with a measurement of the dispersion in the arrival time of optical wavelengths of 0.35 and 0.55 @xmath9 from the crab nebula pulsar , a stringent limit on the possible speed dependence on frequency was set @xcite , but the corresponding limit on the photon mass was only @xmath10 g. assuming that the radio and gamma - ray photons of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have the same origin and that they are emitted at the same time , @xcite set the most stringent limit on the frequency dependence of speed of light up to now , implying a photon mass @xmath11 g , by analysing the arrival time delay between radio and the gamma - ray emission from grb 980703 at high redshift .    the discovery of fast radio bursts ( frbs ) @xcite makes it possible to apply these new probes to constrain the photon mass .",
    "the pulse arrival times follow the @xmath12 law , which is consistent with the propagation of radio waves through a cold plasma .",
    "the high values of dm ( dispersion measure ) , if contributed from the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) , would place these bursts in the redshift range of 0.5 to 1 @xcite . even though the distance scale and physical origin of these events are still subject to debate , the extra - galactic origin of frbs",
    "is suggested by an increasing number of recent observations @xcite , especially the detection of ten additional bursts from the direction of frb 121102 @xcite , and the potential applications of frbs as cosmological probes have been suggested @xcite .",
    "very recently , @xcite report the first precise localization for an frb thanks to the identification of a fading radio transient , providing the first redshift measurement to frb 150418 ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the simple , sharp , temporal feature of the frb signal allows one to easily derive the observed time delay between different frequencies .",
    "these time lags are usually small ( @xmath14 s ) , which make frbs one of the best candidates for constraining the rest mass of photon .    in this letter",
    ", we study the prospects of constraining the photon rest mass with frbs in detail .",
    "our original motivation is the discovery of a radio wave in frb 150418 with an approximately 0.815 s delay time that occurs simultaneously from frequencies 1.2 to 1.5 ghz .",
    "we will show that frbs can be a new powerful tool for constraining the photon mass . throughout this letter",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters recently derived from nine - year @xmath15 @xmath16 @xmath17 @xmath18 ( wmap ) observations @xcite : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "assuming that the photon has a non - zero rest mass @xmath23 , according to einstein s special relativity , the energy equation can be written as @xmath24 in vacuum , the dispersion relation between the speed of photon @xmath25 and frequency @xmath26 is @xmath27 where @xmath28 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq2 ] ) shows that the high energy / frequency photons travel in vacuum faster than the low energy / frequency photons .",
    "two photons emitted simultaneously by a source would arrive on earth with a time delay if they have different frequencies .    here",
    "we consider two photons ( one with higher frequency @xmath29 and the other with lower frequency @xmath30 ) are emitted simultaneously from a source at redshift @xmath31 .",
    "for the high energy photon , the time of arrival to the earth is set to be @xmath32 . since the higher energy photon would arrive earlier than the lower one , the arrival time corresponds to @xmath33 @xmath34 for the lower one .",

    "because the comoving distance traveled by these two photons should be the same ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) , the observer - frame delay time ( @xmath38 ) between these two photons can be expressed as @xmath39 where @xmath40 km @xmath41 @xmath42 is the hubble constant and @xmath43 so the photon mass can be constrained as @xmath44^{1/2}\\;,\\ ] ] which can be simplified as @xmath45^{1/2}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the radio frequency in units of @xmath47 hz .",

    "a conservative upper limit for @xmath23 can be estimated . as shown in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , a strict limit on the photon rest mass from frb 150418 is @xmath51 g , which is @xmath52 times better than that obtained by grbs @xcite .",
    "we note that our restriction has been generally confirmed later by @xcite .",
    "-0.2 in        -0.1 in",
    "according to the characteristic observational feature of frbs , i.e. , that the arrival time delay at a given frequency @xmath26 follows a @xmath12 law , the observed time delay @xmath53 between different frequencies should be mainly contributed by the non - zero photon mass effect and the plasma effect via the dispersion process from the line - of - sight free electron content , i.e. , @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 has the same sign as @xmath56 , as both predict higher energy photons travel faster than the lower energy photons ( see below ) . in our calculation",
    ", we have for simplicity assumed that all of the observed time delay is caused by the non - zero photon mass effect . for completeness , we will also test the case by subtracting the contribution from the plasma effect in @xmath53 .",
    "it should be underlined that the measured dispersion has contributions from the milky way , intervening intergalactic medium ( igm ) , and frb host galaxy . since the number density of electrons in host galaxy is hard to know and the contribution of the milky way dispersion is negligible , we just consider the igm dispersion .",
    "we assume that the intervening intergalactic medium between the source and the earth is fully ionized hydrogen and singly - ionized helium when the source located very late after the re - ionization epoch of the universe ( e.g. , @xmath57 ) , and the ionized igm is homogeneously distributed .",
    "the plasma frequency of igm is @xmath58 s@xmath59 .",
    "the number density of electrons in igm increases with the redshift , @xmath60 .",
    "we adopt the mass fraction of helium in igm is @xmath61 @xcite , the free electron number per baryon can be estimated to be 0.82 .",
    "so the local number density of free electrons in igm is @xmath62 @xmath63 @xcite , where @xmath64 is the local baryon number density and @xmath65 is the current baryon fraction of the universe .",
    "the igm magnetic effect on the velocity dispersion of photons can be neglected , since the lamour frequency @xmath66 s@xmath59 is much smaller than @xmath67 for typical igm with @xmath68 @xmath63 and @xmath69 g. due to the plasma effect , the speed of a photon with energy @xmath70 travelling in igm at redshift @xmath31 is @xmath71,\\ ] ] for @xmath72 ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) , where @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 this dispersion also leads photons with higher energies travelling faster than those with lower energies ( see equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) ) .",
    "similar to the derivations of the formulas in section 2 , the time lag caused by the igm plasma effect can be expressed as @xmath77 where @xmath78 equation  ( [ eq15 ] ) can be simplified as @xmath79    with the redshift of frb 150418 , an estimation on @xmath55 between frequencies @xmath49 ghz and @xmath50 ghz from equation  ( 11 ) is @xmath80 s. now the stricter upper limit on the photon mass comes to be @xmath81 g for the case of @xmath82 s. if we have a better understanding of the host galaxy dispersion , our constraint would be further improved in some degree .",
    "in this letter , we have shown that frbs can be used to place severe limits on the photon mass @xmath83 . from the frequency - dependent delay of frb 150418 , we obtained approximately a delay time @xmath84 s of the radio pulse at @xmath85 ghz relative to that at @xmath86 ghz . considering the delay time was caused by the non - zero photon mass ( @xmath87 ) effect and adopting the possible redshift @xmath0 for frb 150418 ,",
    "the severe limit on the photon mass is @xmath88 g , which represents an improvement of three orders of magnitude over the results by grbs from @xcite .",
    "notice that this is a conservative upper limits : the inclusion of contributions from the other neglected potential contributions to @xmath53 can make this limit even more stringent .",
    "if the time delay between different frequencies is mainly contributed by the plasma effect , more severe constraints would be achieved ( e.g. , @xmath81 g ) if the contribution from the plasma effect has been subtracted in @xmath53 ( i.e. , @xmath89 ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the measurement of the cosmic density of ionized baryons @xmath90 from the dispersion measure and the redshift of frb 150418 is in agreement with the expectation from wmap observations , which leads one to conclude that the observed time delay for frb 150418 is highly dominated by plasma dispersion , with very small contribution possibly from the non - zero photon mass effect .",
    "optimistically , if the non - zero photon mass effect is responsible for @xmath91 of @xmath53 of frb 150418 , the upper limit on @xmath23 could be set to @xmath92 g , which is closer to the current most stringent constraints as adopted by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "the results presented here show the potentially high benefits to be obtained when more frbs are observed , especially if the redshifts of frbs can be more likely to be measured in the future .    while there may be multiple physical origins for the population of frbs , the extra - galactic origin of at least some frbs is receiving increasingly supports from the observational data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we find that even if frb 150418 originate within our local group ( 1 mpc ; * ? ? ? * ) or the local supercluster ( 50 mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a strict limit on the photon mass of @xmath93 g or @xmath94 g can be still achieved , which is already 10 times or 100 times smaller than that obtained by grbs using the same method @xcite .",
    "currently , the detection rate of frbs is relatively low , mainly due to the lack of either necessary high time resolution or a wide field of view in any of the current telescopes .",
    "future radio transient surveys such as the square kilometer array would break through these obstacles @xcite , and are expected to discover and precisely localize an increasing number of frbs . with the abundant observational information in the future",
    ", the mysteries of the physical nature of frbs are expected to be eventually unveiled , and their capability for testing fundamental physics , as discussed here , will find increased use .",
