    "the physical mechanisms behind the heating of the solar corona and the acceleration of the fast solar wind are two major unresolved issues in solar physics .",
    "thermal heating alone is not sufficient to bring models into agreement with observations of the lower corona and at earth @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of the solar wind occurs predominantly within a few solar radii of the surface @xcite .",
    "additionally , solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) observations have shown that ions are heated below 4 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that because the locations for the heating of the corona and the acceleration of the solar wind are the same , it is possible that the same mechanism could contribute to both .",
    "one source of heating is magnetic reconnection associated with flares and nanoflares at the solar surface . using extreme ultraviolet observations ,",
    "@xcite have suggested the heating of active regions is impulsive , and therefore could be associated with nanoflares . in the high speed solar wind , reconnection events current sheets and filaments have been suggested as a heating mechanism @xcite .    in the lower corona , the region of interest in this work , damping of alfvn waves is known to produce nonthermal acceleration and to bring models into agreement with observations both near the sun and at large distances @xcite .",
    "the possible damping mechanisms for alfvn waves in the photosphere to lower corona are numerous and include nonlinear damping @xcite , turbulent cascade @xcite , phase mixing @xcite , landau damping @xcite , neutral collisional @xcite , ion - cyclotron damping @xcite , and surface alfvn wave damping @xcite ( and references herein ) .",
    "global magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) models that do not include waves employ different methods such as empirical heating functions or varied polytropic index distribution to drive and heat the solar wind and are able to match well with ulysses , yohkoh , helios and advanced composition explorer data @xcite . to include alfvn wave damping in a realistic model of the solar environment ,",
    "physical damping mechanisms must be specified .",
    "some mhd models use alfvn waves without specifying a damping mechanism . global @xcite and",
    "local @xcite models include additional equations for the waves and prescribe an empirical damping length .",
    "these studies are benchmarked with ulysses and helios observations .",
    "alternatively , one can include the wave energy and momentum without damping @xcite , and match soho extreme ultraviolet and yohkoh soft x - ray observations .    of the numerous possible mechanisms for damping alfvn waves , those which we expect to be important for low frequency waves",
    "are nonlinear turbulent damping , phase mixing , surface alfvn waves . in this paper",
    ", we study the contribution of surface alfvn wave damping by utilizing a 3d global mhd simulation of a thermally - driven solar wind @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the lower corona is the inner boundary ( chromosphere and transition region are not resolved . )",
    "waves are not explicitly included in the model , nor can low frequency waves be resolved due to spatial and temporal resolution limits ( to be discussed further in section 2.2 ) .",
    "we consider waves with frequencies lower than those that are completely damped in the chromosphere and on the order of those dominating the heliosphere : @xmath1 hz ( periods 3 seconds to 3 days ) .",
    "alfvn waves have been detected in the lower layers of the solar atmosphere using both ground based observations @xcite and the hinode spacecraft @xcite with periods 2 - 4 minutes ( @xmath4 hz ) .",
    "ground based observations indicate the presence of alfvn waves in the corona with periods of five minutes ( @xmath5 hz ) @xcite . at 1 au ,",
    "the dominant wave power is in waves with periods of 1 - 3 hours ( @xmath6 to @xmath7 hz ) @xcite .    in this study",
    "we are interested in a damping mechanism that acts in the lower corona @xcite . in the chromosphere ,",
    "alfvn waves with frequencies above 0.6 hz are damped by ion - neutral collisional damping and frequencies below @xmath8 hz were unaffected @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that waves below @xmath8 hz were not damped by any mechanism in the chromosphere .",
    "@xcite also found that nonlinear damping occurred over the extended corona .",
    "@xcite found waves @xmath9 hz were reflected by a gradient in the background alfvn profile , and dissipated not in the lower layers of the atmosphere , but over distance of a few solar radii . in the corona ,",
    "the ion - cyclotron frequency is @xmath10 hz , so cyclotron resonance damping is not relevant for low frequency waves . phase mixing of outgoing and reflected incoming alfvn waves has also been studied @xcite .    using a combination of three damping mechanisms ( nonlinear damping , surface alfvn wave damping , and phase mixing ) , @xcite were able to match observations of mass loss rates and terminal velocities for cool , giant stars .",
    "they applied their model to the sun and were able to obtain coronal heating and match wind velocity and alfvn wave power density observations in a 1d simulation @xcite . in this paper , we extend their work on surface alfvn wave damping in a 3d simulation of the solar corona .",
    "surface alfvn waves form on a magnetic interface - a finite thickness boundary separating two regions of plasma with a strong inhomogeneity in magnetic field and/or density .",
    "the alfvn wave in each region can interact , damp and transfer energy into the resonant layer separating the two plasmas ( resonant absorption ) .",
    "@xcite first utilized surface alfvn waves and resonant absorption as a mechanism to heat coronal loops .",
    "the transfer of mhd wave energy by resonant absorption was also studied in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "an alternative dissipation mechanism for surface alfvn waves is nonlinear wave steepening @xcite .",
    "these and other efforts , e.g. @xcite have resulted in damping lengths which depend on the frequency of the waves , the nature of the magnetic interface , and the local plasma parameters ( density , magnetic field and velocity ) .    utilizing these relations , the profile of the damping length in the wind has been estimated @xcite .",
    "all previous studies made assumptions about the wind .",
    "for example , @xcite calculated nonlinear viscous damping of surface alfvn waves in polar coronal holes .",
    "they assumed two values of the superradial expansion of the magnetic field lines , profiles for density ( based on observations ) , and a single frequency ( 0.01 hz ) .",
    "they obtained one profile , and concluded that the nonlinear damping of the surface alfvn waves in region of strong magnetic field expansion should contribute significantly to the heating in the solar wind .    the surface alfvn wave damping length depends on the profile of the background alfvn speed . as was shown in a survey of alfvn speed profiles from several mhd models @xcite , the alfvn profiles for @xcite and @xcite are almost identical below 10 @xmath0 , and the profiles were different from mhd models using empirical heating functions .",
    "the profile for @xcite is similar to these two , but differs very low in the corona .",
    "@xcite concluded that the inclusion of alfvn waves with empirical damping brought mhd models better in alignment with local heating studies that had the best agreement with observations .    in the present study , we quantify the surface alfvn wave damping length for use in an mhd wave - driven model .",
    "we expect to find surface alfvn waves in the border between the fast and slow solar wind for two reasons : a ) the gradient in density and b ) the superradial expansion of the open magnetic field required to fill the space over closed streamers .",
    "we will focus on the superradial expansion of the field lines and compare our 3d mhd model with the observational study of @xcite .",
    "our calculations show that waves with periods less than 1 hour ( frequency greater than 2.8 @xmath3 hz ) are damped in the region between 1 - 4 @xmath0 , the region of interest for both solar wind acceleration and coronal heating @xcite .",
    "no other major source of damping has been suggested for these waves in this region .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of the 3d geometry in our results .",
    "we show that the contribution of the damping of surface alfvn waves to the wind is on the order of magnitude as ( or in some cases larger than ) turbulence .",
    "it is important to note that this study of waves in a solar wind solution was not self consistent - we did not consider any back effects on the waves from the plasma .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the theory and numerical simulation background . in section 3",
    "we calculate the location of coronal hole boundaries , and the damping length profile along those lines . in section 4",
    "we estimate the energy surface alfvn waves will deposit below 4 @xmath0 .",
    "we also calculate the heating invoked in a semi - empirical thermodynamical model , compare with the wave flux and discuss the results .",
    "finally , conclusions can be found in section 5 .",
    "the inhomogeneity in density and/or magnetic field that gives rise to the surface alfvn waves can be described analytically as either a discontinuity or finite layer @xcite , such as a flux tube . for the case of a rapidly expanding flux tube of width @xmath11 , ( where @xmath11 is much smaller than the radius of the flux tube ) , surface alfvn waves form on the inner and outer surfaces .",
    "these waves can interact , damp and deposit energy into the surrounding plasma with a damping rate @xcite , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the average wave number , @xmath14 is the frequency and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the alfvn wave frequency on either side of the flux tube ( 1 representing inside and 2 outside . )",
    "we assume the width of the flux tube to be much smaller than the radius .",
    "this allows us to take @xmath17 , as in @xcite .",
    "if the frequency on the outside is much larger than the frequency inside ( i.e. , a strong inhomogeneity ) , then the damping rate is @xmath18    the surface alfvn wave damping length can be written as the alfvn speed @xmath19 divided by the damping rate , @xmath20 the initial damping length @xmath21 can be written as @xmath22 which , by taking @xmath17 , can be simplified to @xmath23    utilizing the relation that @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the superradial expansion factor of the field line ) , and fixing the frequency of the waves to be constant with height , the damping length in the inertial frame is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is alfvn mach number , @xmath28 is the solar wind speed , @xmath29 is the magnetic field strength , @xmath30 is the mass density .",
    "the subscript 0 indicates the variable is to be evaluated at the reference height .    in the present study the model",
    "does not treat the chromosphere or the transition region ; the lower corona is the inner boundary .",
    "the cell size at the inner boundary is @xmath31 , and so we chose @xmath32=1.04@xmath0 as our reference height to assure that calculations would not include the solar surface inner boundary cells .",
    "we quantify the expansion of open field lines by @xmath25 , given by .",
    "@xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cross sectional area of the flux tube at distance @xmath35 .",
    "a value of 2 for @xmath25 indicates pure radial expansion .",
    "the lines which border closed field lines must open faster than radial to fill the space above the closed loops . in studies where @xmath25 is not a function of @xmath35 ,",
    "typical values chosen were 2 - 6 for open field regions from 1 - 10 @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "here we determine @xmath25 explicitly as a function of height from 1.04 - 10 @xmath0 .    a similar parameter for the expansion of a field line is the superradial diverging factor or superradial enhancement factor @xmath36 , as in @xmath37 we will use a 3d mhd model as a laboratory to estimate the contribution of the surface waves to the wind from 1.04 - 10 @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain steady state solar wind solutions by using the solar corona component of the space weather modeling framework ( swmf ) , developed by the university of michigan @xcite .",
    "this 3d global magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) model incorporates michelson doppler imager ( mdi ) magnetograms to generate an initial magnetic field configuration with the potential field source surface model ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "an initial density is assumed on the solar surface ( @xmath38 @xmath39 ) , and the mhd equations are evolved in local time steps ( 12,000 iterations ) and time accurate calculations ( for ten minutes ) to achieve steady state solutions for solar minima conditions in a 24 @xmath40 24 @xmath40 24 @xmath0 domain .",
    "the steady state was generated with carrington rotation ( cr ) 1912 .",
    "solar wind solutions from swmf were validated in @xcite from cr1916 - 1929 by comparing with advanced composition explorer and wind satellite data ( near 1 au ) .",
    "cr1912 was chosen to allow for comparisons to an observational study of the expansion of open field lines @xcite .",
    "waves occur naturally as a perturbation to the mhd equations , and so their presence may be expected when solving the mhd equations in space and time .",
    "however , in global simulations waves have to be included explicitly @xcite due to time and spatial limitations . the time step of this simulation ( 0.2 seconds ) is less than the smallest period considered in this analysis ( 3 seconds ) .",
    "additionally , the grid resolution is not enough to spatially resolve the waves .",
    "@xcite ( herein referred to as do99 ) characterized the large - scale solar magnetic topology during solar minima conditions ( august 1996 ) using data from the solar and heliospheric observatory s ( soho ) ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer instrument .",
    "they analyzed the latitudinal dependence of two line emission intensities and found the values were constant within the large polar coronal holes but suddenly increased at the border of the holes and equatorial streamers .",
    "do99 used this increase in intensity to identify the colatitude of coronal hole boundary ( chb ) , i.e. the border between open and closed magnetic field lines . in the present study",
    ", we identify the chb locations as the open field line with the largest colatitude ( the angle measured from the pole to the equator ) in the steady state described in the previous section .",
    "we compare our calculation of the field expansion with the observed values from do99 .",
    "figure 1 shows the 3d coronal hole boundary ( chb ) field lines obtained from the model .",
    "the different colors refer to : red as northeast ( ne ) ; blue as southeast ( se ) ; green as southwest ( sw ) ; and purple as northwest ( nw ) .",
    "the solar surface is shown colored by the radial component of the magnetic field .",
    "on 1996 august 17 , there was an active region near the center of the disk , and mostly quiet sun at the intersection of the plane of the sky with the photosphere .",
    "the first two rows of table [ tbl1 ] provide chb colatitudes ( angle measured from the pole to the chb footpoint ) found in do99 and this study .",
    "we find that 3 of the 4 simulated chb are higher in latitude ( i.e. , smaller colatitude ) compared to do99 .",
    "as we discuss below , these differences could be due to projection effects .",
    "the superradial expansion factor @xmath25 and superradial enhancement factor @xmath36 were calculated as a function of height for each chb field line . in figure 2",
    "we show @xmath36 for the chb lines in this study .",
    "additionally , we have included the @xmath36 profiles which correspond to the minimum and maximum asymptotic values of @xmath36 for chbs determined in do99 .",
    "rows 3 and 4 in table [ tbl1 ] provide the asymptotic superradial enhancement factor value for each line .",
    "we find that both @xmath25 and @xmath36 cover a larger range of values compared to dob99 .",
    "only the sw line from our simulation falls in the range from do99 and only from 3 - 6 @xmath0 . in general",
    ", we find that 3 of the 4 boundary lines ( all except sw ) have lower values in our simulation compared to do99 .",
    "the best agreement for the location of the chb between the studies is the sw line .",
    "the southern hemisphere from the simulation is more similar to the results deduced from observations in the plane of the sky in do99 than the northern hemisphere .",
    "overall , we find that @xcite had larger values of @xmath36 , and a small range of values , for the same field lines .",
    "as we show below , this result is due to 3d vs. 2d projection effects .      in order to quantify the significance of 2d projection effects in the context of the expansion of field lines",
    ", we calculated @xmath36 for four field lines shown in figure 3a .",
    "the projection of the field lines on the plane of the sky is shown in figure 3b",
    ". contours of solar wind speed ( in @xmath41 are shown in figures 3a and b , and the solar surface is shown as white sphere .",
    "figure 3c provides the superradial enhancement factor @xmath36 , calculated according to equation [ eq : f ] for each field line ( labeled a , b , c and d as in figure 3b ) .",
    "the calculation of the 3d line is shown as solid lines , and the 2d projection line calculation is shown as dashed lines .",
    "figure 3c demonstrates that a 2d projection of a 3d field line on the plane of the sky can overestimate the divergence of the line .",
    "the 3d lines from a - d all approach values of f  4 while the 2d estimates vary between 4 and 13 .",
    "this projection effect explains why the values for @xmath36 from our simulation are smaller than those determined in the observational study of do99 .",
    "it is crucial , therefore , to do studies of surface alfvn wave damping in a 3d simulation in order to capture the true divergence of the field lines .      in figure 4 , we plot @xmath42 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : l ] ) which was calculated using parameters @xmath30 , @xmath29 and @xmath43 from the steady state solution .",
    "figure 4a presents @xmath42 for the coronal hole boundary field lines in figure 1 with frequency @xmath44 hz , normalized to the initial damping length @xmath45 of the sw line ( chosen because of the agreement with do99 ) .",
    "this normalization allows for comparison of the profile features from different source regions as a function of height . in figure 4b we feature only the sw line and present @xmath42 for several frequencies , from @xmath46 hz .",
    "it can be seen in figure 4b that frequencies above @xmath47 ( short dashed line ) will be appreciably damped within a few solar radii of the surface .",
    "figure 4a shows distinctly different profiles from the southern and northern chb lines .",
    "we examined the source region of each footpoint and found that the se and sw lines originated near small active regions in which the radial component of the magnetic field @xmath48 g. both northern hemisphere lines originated from quiet sun regions ( @xmath49 g ) . for swmf and other mhd models",
    ", @xcite showed that the alfvn profile will contain a maximum , or hump , if the source region is quiet sun .",
    "the profile from an active region in global models begins at a maximum value , and drops to less than a few hundred @xmath50 within one solar radius from the surface .",
    "the profile of @xmath42 is controlled by the alfvn speed profile .",
    "the normalized profiles in fig .",
    "4a show that the position corresponding to @xmath51 is closest to the sun for active regions .",
    "the profiles from quiet sun source regions have a plateau , pushing @xmath51 further from the sun .",
    "the implication of this result can be seen in the equation relating the alfvn wave energy density , @xmath52 if the damping length is @xmath53 or less , then the waves will be damped close to the sun .",
    "therefore , the presence of the hump means the energy of the surface alfvn wave can travel further into the corona before substantial damping occurs .",
    "this means that the quiet sun region will damp more surface waves at further distances , so it is more efficient in carrying the wave momentum out into the corona .",
    "active regions will damp closest to the sun .",
    "in the previous section we considered how surface alfvn waves at the solar surface with the frequency range @xmath54 to @xmath55 hz @xcite would be damped in our background solar wind environment .",
    "we found that waves with frequency above @xmath56 hz were appreciably damped below 4@xmath0 .",
    "we now consider the contribution of their wave flux to the energy of the wind .",
    "there will be a contribution to the momentum of the wind as well , but in this analysis we ignore this contribution .",
    "we assume that the wave damping will contribute solely to heating the wind ; therefore we derive here an upper limit on their contribution to the heating of the plasma .",
    "the spectra of the surface alfvn waves @xcite is : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the mean frequency in the observed range and the power index corresponding to the low frequency waves we are considering is @xmath60=0.6 @xcite .",
    "we assume that this flux of surface alfvn waves is propagating along open field lines during solar minima . this flux will decrease with distance as @xmath61 where @xmath42 is the damping length , for each frequency . with the damping lengths calculated in the previous section ,",
    "we calculate how much flux is lost between @xmath62 ( our self - imposed reference height ) and @xmath63 .",
    "the height of @xmath63 was chosen because the contribution to solar wind acceleration and coronal heating must be deposited within a few solar radii of the sun @xcite .",
    "the contribution to the solar wind at each frequency is @xmath64 where the limits are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , and the definition of @xmath67 from equation [ eq : l ] has been included ( @xmath68 , @xmath25 , @xmath69 , are all functions of r. )    we replace @xmath45 in eq .

    "it should be stressed that we are not doing a self - consistent calculation : we are estimating wave flux from a model that does not include waves , and we are not considering any feedback of the waves on the plasma .",
    "the simulation analyzed in this paper is that of a thermally driven solar wind .",
    "the polytropic index @xmath73 in the model varies in space by utilizing the wang - sheeley - arge model and the conservation of energy along a solar wind field line using the bernoulli equation .",
    "this serves to artificially heat the wind @xcite in a manner mimicking turbulence @xcite .",
    "figure 5 shows the distribution of @xmath73 in the plane of the sky on 1996 august 17 . in this section",
    "we quantify the heating due to this variable gamma , and do a comparison with the energy deposited by damped surface alfvn waves , as in eq .",
    "[ eq : fluxlost4 ] .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics attributes changes in the internal energy @xmath74 of a gas to work done on or by the gas @xmath75 , and heat added to or removed from the gas @xmath76 . in the case of an ideal gas , the change in internal energy can be written as @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the specific heat at constant volume .",
    "the work is expressed as @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the pressure and @xmath81 is the volume . the first law can therefore be written as @xmath82 by introducing the ideal gas equation of state and assuming that the ratios of specific heats are constants , one can derive a polytropic equation , @xmath83 where @xmath60 is referred to as the polytropic index .",
    "the notation stems from @xcite to clarify that this index can ( but need not ) be the ratio of specific heats , and that we are not necessarily considering an adiabatic process .",

    "observations of the solar wind have indicated that @xmath60=1.46 - 1.58 in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "a value closer to unity is adopted in some global mhd models in the region near the sun in order to generate fast solar wind and match temperature observations in the heliosphere @xcite .",
    "all previous discussion had the underlying assumption that @xmath60 was constant with height .",

    "we will characterize the additional heating provided by the prescribed distribution of @xmath73 in our solar wind simulation , and argue that surface alfvn waves damped near the sun could replace this artificial heating and move the model towards a more physical treatment of the solar environment . for a solar wind with a constant ratio of specific heats @xmath84 , the conservation of energy can be written as @xcite : @xmath88 = \\rho { \\bf g}\\cdot { \\bf u } + q\\ ] ] where p is the thermal pressure , q is the additional heating function , and the energy density is @xmath89 recent global mhd studies adopt an exponential function for the form of q with several free parameters in order to benchmark the model with observations during solar minima conditions @xcite . substituting eq .",

    "surface waves formed on flux tubes with footpoints in an active region will damp closer to the sun .",
    "the required heating from an active region was found to be larger than the damping of surface alfvn wave flux , therefore another mechanism ( such as turbulence ) may be the dominant heating in these regions , with surface alfvn waves contributing approximately 20@xmath102 of the heating .",
    "we estimated damping of surface alfvn waves in the border between open and closed field lines at heights 1.04 - 4 @xmath0 due to the superradial expansion of the field lines .",
