    "in this paper we report some major advances in understanding ( albeit not a complete solution to ) a difficult general class of problems in mathematical physics .",
    "we consider here the conversion of a continuum problem into a discrete problem by the insertion of a lattice spacing parameter @xmath0 , the solution of the continuum problem on the lattice , and the subsequent extremely subtle continuum limit @xmath1 .",
    "almost every continuum physics problem is singular as a function of the parameters in the problem . as a result ,",
    "only rarely does the perturbation series take the form of a taylor series having a nonzero radius of convergence . as an elementary example , consider the algebraic polynomial equation @xmath2 this problem is singular in the limit @xmath3 . in this limit , the degree of the polynomial changes from three to one and thus two of the roots abruptly disappear . as a consequence , a perturbative solution to this problem [ expressing the roots @xmath4 as series in powers of @xmath5 yields expressions that are more complicated than taylor series .",
    "a more elaborate example of a singular problem is the time - independent schrdinger equation @xmath6\\psi({\\bf x})=0 . \\label{eq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the classical limit @xmath7 this differential equation abruptly becomes an _ algebraic _ equation , and thus the general solution no longer contains any arbitrary constants or functions and , as a result , it can no longer satisfy the initial conditions . we know that for small @xmath8 the solution is not taylor - like but",
    "rather is a singular exponential in wkb form : @xmath9    in the study of quantum field theory , it is well known that infinities appear in the perturbative expansion in powers of the coupling constant .",
    "there are two kinds of infinities .",
    "the first kind , which is due to the point - like nature of the interaction , requires the use of renormalization .",
    "the second kind , which is due to singularities in the complex - coupling - constant plane , forces the perturbation series to have a zero radius of convergence .",
    "a quantum field theory can be regulated by introducing a lattice spacing .",
    "the resulting discrete theory is completely finite and can be studied numerically by using various kinds of numerical methods such as monte carlo integration .",
    "however , the underlying singular nature of the continuum quantum field theory resurfaces in the continuum limit @xmath1 .",
    "the introduction of a lattice spacing and the singular nature of the continuum limit was investigated in a series of papers by bender _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "a quantum field theory is just one instance in which discretization regulates and eliminates the singular nature of the problem .",
    "it is also known that introducing a lattice spacing converts a boundary - layer problem , which is a singular perturbation problem , into a regular perturbation problem @xcite .",
    "boundary - layer problem _ is a differential - equation - boundary - value problem in which the highest derivative of the differential equation is multiplied by a small parameter @xmath10 .",
    "consider as an example @xmath11 where the boundary conditions on the function @xmath12 typically have a form such as @xmath13 this boundary - value problem is singular because in the limit @xmath3 one of the solutions abruptly disappears and the limiting solution is not able to satisfy the two boundary conditions in ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "the usual way to solve the boundary - value problem ( [ eq4 ] )  ( [ eq5 ] ) is to decompose the interval @xmath14 into two regions , an _ outer region _ , in which the solution varies slowly as a function of @xmath15 , and an _ inner region _ or _",
    "boundary - layer region _ , in which the solution varies rapidly as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the boundary - layer region is a narrow region whose thickness is typically of order @xmath10 or some power of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "an important example of a boundary - layer problem is the instanton equation @xmath16 with the associated boundary conditions @xmath17 the exact solution to this instanton problem is @xmath18 note that the solution @xmath19 varies rapidly at the origin @xmath20 over a region of thickness @xmath10 ; this is the boundary - layer region .",
    "the solution varies slowly ( it is approximately @xmath21 ) outside of this region .",
    "the outer region consists of those @xmath15 not near the origin .    a novel way to solve",
    "the instanton problem is to discretize it by introducing a lattice . on the lattice ,",
    "the differential equation becomes a difference equation that can easily be solved perturbatively . in the continuum limit ,",
    "as the lattice spacing vanishes , we then obtain a strong - coupling expansion that must be evaluated by means of a pad or a variational perturbation theory method . to illustrate the approach our objective will be to calculate the slope of the instanton at @xmath20 , which from ( [ bl4 ] ) has the value @xmath22    we introduce a lattice with lattice spacing @xmath0 so that the real axis is discretized in steps of width @xmath0 .",
    "the spatial coordinate reads @xmath23 , where the function @xmath19 assumes the value @xmath24 . on the lattice",
    "the second spatial derivative in ( [ bl3 ] ) becomes @xmath25 thus , from the instanton equation ( [ bl3 ] ) we obtain the difference equation @xmath26 where the boundary values follow from ( [ boo ] ) : @xmath27    the natural expansion parameter now is @xmath28 , to which we assign the name @xmath29 : @xmath30 the singular perturbation problem in the continuum [ whose solution @xmath19 in ( [ bl4 ] ) does not possess a taylor expansion in powers of @xmath5 , has become a _ regular _ perturbation problem .",
    "that is , we can now expand the solution @xmath31 to the difference equation ( [ bl6 ] ) as a _",
    "taylor series _ in powers of @xmath29 : @xmath32    we impose the boundary values ( [ bl6a ] ) by requiring that @xmath33 inserting the _ ansatz _ ( [ bl7 ] ) into the difference equation ( [ bl6 ] ) , we get the recursion relation @xcite @xmath34 for the first derivative at the origin @xmath20 this leads to the series @xmath35    we have calculated the coefficients @xmath36 with the help of maple v r7 up to order @xmath37 .",
    "the first 20 numbers are given in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "a complete list of these coefficients can be found on the webpage of the author fw @xcite .",
    "note that the expansion parameter @xmath29 in ( [ bl10 ] ) is not small but rather tends to infinity in the limit as the lattice spacing @xmath0 approaches zero . using the parameter @xmath29 defined in ( [ delta ] ) we rewrite the series ( [ bl10 ] ) as @xmath38 taking into account the exact result ( [ bl4a ] ) , we obtain the identity @xmath39    the purpose of this paper is to examine equations like ( [ bl11 ] ) .",
    "this equation shows that the singular nature of the instanton problem has resurfaced in the continuum limit @xmath40 of the lattice expansion .",
    "the expression on the right side of ( [ bl11 ] ) should have the value @xmath41 , but it is not at all obvious why this is so , and the objective of this paper is to analyze this difficult and subtle limit .",

    "[ sec2 ] we use pad techniques to perform the limit in ( [ bl11 ] ) .",
    "we will see that while the results are not bad ( the accuracy is about 1% ) , better methods are needed .",
    "we perform the pad analysis to much higher order than has ever been done before and we discover a new qualitative behavior that has not yet been observed . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we try the use of the variational perturbation theory techniques introduced by kleinert to perform the sum in ( [ bl11 ] ) .",
    "these techniques increase the accuracy by a factor of about @xmath42 , but they still do not give the exact result . while variational perturbation theory works very well in summing the strong - coupling series for the ground - state energy of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite , and for the critical exponents of second - order phase transitions @xcite ,",
    "we show that the series in ( [ bl11 ] ) is at the very edge of validity for kleinert s methods .",
    "we then examine the large - order behavior of the terms of the sum in ( [ bl11 ] ) in sec .",
    "we show definitively that the taylor expansion has a nonzero radius of convergence and thus , on the lattice , the instanton problem is a regular perturbation problem .    in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we turn to a more difficult singular perturbation problem ; namely , the blasius equation of fluid dynamics .",
    "we use the same approach as for the instanton equation . in secs .",
    "[ sec6 ] , [ sec7 ] , and [ sec8 ] we study the summation of the lattice perturbation expansion using pad and variational methods and we examine the large - order behavior of the lattice perturbation series .",
    "we find that pad methods give good but not excellent results and that variational perturbation theory is better than pad .",
    "again , the series we need to evaluate in the continuum limit lies at the very edge of validity for kleinert s methods .",
    "we also find that , unlike the lattice perturbation expansion coefficients for the instanton problem , the sign pattern of the blasius weak - coupling series does not alternate .",
    "rather , it is governed by a cosine function with a frequency different from @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we examine what happens if we attempt to evaluate the right side of ( [ bl11 ] ) by using pad techniques .",
    "pad resummation has already been applied to the instanton problem up to 50th order @xcite .",
    "however , we have been able to perform the procedures to much higher orders .",
    "we have discovered that remarkable and unsuspected new phenomena occur just a few orders beyond what has been computed .",
    "the procedure is as follows .",
    "consider the formal frobenius series @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a non - negative number",
    ". raising this series to the power @xmath46 , inverting the right hand side and re - expanding , we obtain @xmath47 with new expansion coefficients @xmath48 . assuming we know the first @xmath49 terms of the original power series in ( [ bl13 ] ) , we raise equation ( [ bl14 ] ) to the power @xmath50 .",
    "we then truncate the summation at @xmath51 , finally getting @xmath52 where we have re - expanded and obtained new expansion coefficients @xmath53 . in the limit @xmath40 ,",
    "only the @xmath50th term in the denominator survives and we obtain the approximant @xmath54    the approximant @xmath55 is the zeroth - order survivor of the limiting process . also , taking into account the first - order correction we observe that , as in the case of variational perturbation theory ( see sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] ) , there is an approach to scaling . in the limit @xmath56 the frobenius series @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ bl13 ] ) converges to a constant @xmath58 .",
    "additionally , the approach to scaling , following from the pad resummation ( [ bl16 ] ) , reveals how fast it converges : @xmath59    we now apply this procedure to the boundary - layer problem ( [ bl6 ] ) .",
    "[ recall that the weak - coupling coefficients for the first 20 coefficients @xmath60 obtained from ( [ bl9 ] ) are shown in table [ tab1 ] and that more can be found in @xcite . ] resumming the series ( [ bl7 ] ) for @xmath61 , @xmath62 according to the pad procedure ( [ bl16 ] ) with @xmath63 as follows from ( [ bl11 ] ) and evaluating the approximants @xmath64 , we get the numbers listed in table [ tab ] .",
    "compared with the numerical solution @xmath65 , this strong - coupling expansion seems to converge quite well .",
    "however , when we go to higher orders , we find that the numbers drop below the exact solution and assume a minimum at @xmath66 , where the approximant has the value @xmath67 .",
    "the approximants then rise again , cross the exact solution at @xmath68 and become complex at @xmath69 .",
    "the appearance of complex numbers is a consequence of taking the @xmath50th root in equation ( [ bl16 ] ) when the coefficients @xmath70 become negative .",
    "this phenomenon has not been observed before in the course of using this pad procedure .",
    "the imaginary part then becomes smaller and smaller as @xmath50 rises .",
    "abruptly , at @xmath71 , the approximants become real again . as one",
    "can see from the spikes in fig .",
    "[ strong ] this pattern is repeated for higher @xmath50 .",
    "note that the figure only shows the real part of the pad approximant @xmath72 .",
    "apparently , the sequence of approximants @xmath72 does not converge .",
    "the singular nature of the instanton equation has the effect of making the pad approximants behave like the partial sums of a divergent ( asymptotic ) series ; at first the partial sums appear to converge to a limit , and then they veer off . in the case of the pad",
    "s shown in fig .",
    "[ strong ] the approximants approach to within 1% of the correct limit before veering off .",
    "it appears that another more powerful resummation technique is needed to treat the expression in ( [ bl11 ] ) . in the next section",
    "we apply a technique due to kleinert .",
    "kleinert has developed a technique in the context of the ground - state energy of the anharmonic oscillator @xcite and of critical exponents of second - order phase transitions @xcite for summing divergent perturbation series .",
    "this technique , known as kleinert s square - root trick , is described below .    consider a weak - coupling series @xmath73 which is truncated at order @xmath50 .",
    "rewrite this weak - coupling expansion by introducing an auxiliary scaling parameter @xmath74 @xcite : @xmath75 which is set to @xmath76 later .",
    "the square - root trick now reads @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a `` dummy '' scaling parameter and @xmath79 in the case of the anharmonic oscillator , @xmath78 is the frequency @xmath80 of a trial harmonic oscillator @xcite .    substituting ( [ vpt3 ] ) into the truncated weak - coupling series ( [ vpt2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath81 the factor @xmath82 with @xmath83 can be expanded by means of generalized binomials according to @xmath84 where we have used ( [ vpt3b ] ) and finally have set @xmath85 .",

    "the positive real axis is discretized in steps of width @xmath0 , so that we let @xmath106 .",
    "the power series expansion for the discrete function @xmath24 has the form @xmath107 thus , the numerator of the second derivative ( [ bl5 ] ) becomes @xmath108 so the zeroth- , first- , and third - order contributions cancel .",
    "translating the lattice result for @xmath31 back to the continuous function @xmath109 , the difference equation ( [ bl6 ] ) reads @xmath110+f(x)-f^3(x)=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    writing out the power series @xmath111 and comparing even powers of @xmath0 , we get from equation ( [ t3 ] ) for @xmath112 @xmath113 which is just the original instanton equation ( [ bl3 ] ) . for @xmath114",

    "so we identify @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "we now evaluate the leading strong - coupling coefficient @xmath124 from ( [ allgemein ] ) according to ( [ bl18 ] ) with @xmath122 and @xmath123 . to that end",
    "we substitute our 200 weak - coupling coefficients from @xcite into the formula using a computer algebra program .",
    "we are now confronted with the following problem : the principle of least sensitivity can not be unambiguously applied . optimizing with respect to extrema , inflection points , or higher derivatives",
    "does yield converging results for the strong - coupling limit .",
    "however , all these strong - coupling series converge to the wrong values .",
    "there is one particularly unpleasant case : the second derivative with respect to @xmath125 for the largest @xmath125 where this derivative exists ( see fig .",
    "[ vptpic ] ) gives a convergent strong - coupling series .",
    "the numbers come extremely close to @xmath126 as one can see from the 20 numbers in table [ vptapp ] .",
    "the 200th leading strong - coupling coefficient is @xmath127 .",
    "however , a richardson extrapolation @xcite based on the first 200 orders then unfortunately shows that variational perturbation theory produces a value slightly smaller than @xmath126 .",
    "the first six orders of richardson extrapolations are presented in table [ vpttab ] .",
    "hence , the strong - coupling series @xmath128 does converge , but it converges to the wrong number , only one part per 1000 away from the true value : @xmath129 compared with @xmath130  .",
    "the deviation is just @xmath131 , but @xmath126 can unfortunately be ruled out .",
    "given that @xmath122 and @xmath123 , the failure of variational perturbation theory is not surprising .",
    "according to ref .",
    "@xcite the fraction @xmath102 must lie within the open interval @xmath132 .",
    "otherwise , one can not prove that variational perturbation theory converges .",
    "thus , _ this problem lies exactly on the upper boundary of the region in which the summation method is known to work_.    we can understand the upper edge of the range of the parameter @xmath102 that describes the approach to scaling @xmath102 by looking at the standard deviation from the actual limiting value .",
    "it turns out @xcite that the deviation in the limit as the perturbative order @xmath50 goes to infinity assumes the shape @xmath133 where @xmath58 is a constant .",
    "so , to obtain exponential convergence for the sequence formed by the @xmath128 , we need @xmath134 . in other words , the approach to scaling @xmath102",
    "is bounded and it must be smaller than one .",
    "the lower edge is more subtle and is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have applied variational perturbation theory to a case that lies at the very edge of its applicability .",
    "we see that variational perturbation theory gives better results by about a factor of 10 than the pad approximations examined in sec .",
    "however , we have not yet found a systematic method for resumming ( [ bl11 ] ) that enables us to perform the continuum limit of the discrete lattice theory .",
    "therefore , we now lay the foundation for further investigations by analyzing the large - order behavior of the instanton series .",
    "it can be seen from the numerical results in @xcite that the instanton weak - coupling series is of borel type .",

    "in contrast , the data suggests that @xmath139 strongly depends on @xmath142 .",
    "@xmath139 is the numerical value associated with the largest uncertainty .",
    "in fact , eq .",
    "( [ flori4 ] ) suggests that small deviations in @xmath78 and @xmath147 lead to dramatic changes in the value of @xmath139 .",
    "we calculated @xmath147 , @xmath78 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 up to 200th order with the help of maple v r7 .",

    "is broken twice : the signs at @xmath197 and at @xmath198 are not correct if we optimize with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "so we must consider an additional phase shift @xmath199 .",
    "the parameter @xmath200 turns out to be slightly smaller than @xmath43 , but it reproduces all 300 signs correctly .    in order to determine the numerical values of @xmath0 and @xmath200 we define @xmath201 the sum ends at @xmath202 because this is as high as we can calculate using maple ; we know the first 300 weak - coupling coefficients @xmath60 . for the correct values of @xmath0 and @xmath200",
    "the function @xmath203 must be equal to 300 .",
    "we then plot the function @xmath203 over the @xmath0@xmath200 plane and search for peaks .",
    "a careful study of the peaks yields values for @xmath0 and @xmath200 which allow the function @xmath203 to assume its maximum at 300 .",
    "these numbers are given in table [ tabelle3 ] .",
    "the large - order behavior of the blasius weak - coupling coefficients ( unlike the large - order behavior of the instanton coefficients ) has an additional overall factor @xmath199 , and we can now see that the remaining structure differs from the structure of the instanton weak - coupling coefficients . dividing by the cosine , we observe that the coefficients @xmath204 grow factorially fast .",
    "thus , we also divide by @xmath205 : @xmath206 the coefficients @xmath207 are unstable under a ratio test .",
    "that is , the ratio @xmath208 decreases and then begins to oscillate .",
    "this is the inaccuracy that results from the delicate sign pattern of the first 300 coefficients @xmath60 .",
