    "renormalizability is one of the more important issues in quantum field theories . in the case of the noncommutative ( nc ) field theories ,",
    "it is accompanied by the problem of uv / ir mixing which generates infrared singularities , with no analogs in the commutative setting .",
    "whenever stronger than logarithmic , these singularities are very dangerous as they can invalidate the usual perturbative expansion  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to expect that the supersymmetry , being known to improve the ultraviolet ( uv ) behavior , could also solve the problem posed by the uv / ir mixing . that this indeed is the case was explicitly shown first for gauge theories in  @xcite and for scalar theories in  @xcite ) .",
    "several supersymmetric noncommutative models were studied since then and shown to be free of dangerous uv / ir singularities , both in three and four dimensional spacetimes  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric noncommutative gauge theories were particularly much studied , and several interesting properties were found , for example , nontrivial constraints arising from gauge symmetry both at the classical  @xcite and at the quantum level  @xcite . moreover ,  @xcite it was argued that maximally supersymmetric noncommutative gauge theories in four spacetime dimensions were ultraviolet finite , similarly to their commutative counterparts ; some explicit calculations , including considerations on the uv / ir singularities in such maximally supersymmetric theories can be found in  @xcite .    in three spacetime dimensions ,",
    "supersymmetric gauge theories are super - renormalizable and , therefore , nice candidates to be finite quantum field theories . in the noncommutative case , this possibility was partially explored in  @xcite , both for abelian and non - abelian gauge groups .",
    "it was shown that the noncommutative supersymmetric qed and yang - mills theories ( coupled to matter or not ) were indeed finite at one loop , while power counting indicates the absence of superficial divergences at three loops or more . in this work",
    ", we perform a similar analysis for the three - dimensional supersymmetric noncommutative maxwell - chern - simons ( mcs ) theory and explicitly show its finiteness in one , three and higher loop orders .",
    "this model is , therefore , another example of a nontrivial ( interacting ) quantum field theory which is actually ultraviolet finite in perturbation theory .",

    "it is also easy to show that the logarithmically uv divergent parts coming from the planar parts of @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 , which involve derivatives of the gauge fields , as well as the logarithmically uv divergent parts generated by other one - loop graphs , turn out to be proportional to the integral @xmath40 and are therefore finite by symmetric integration .",

    "the typical logarithmically ir singular contribution which could arise is proportional to a linear combination of integrals of the form @xmath41 here , @xmath42 . remembering that @xmath43",

    "we already mentioned that linear divergences are possible only for @xmath25 , or @xmath24 , or @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to see that two - loop graphs satisfying these conditions are just vacuum ones whereas higher - loop graphs can not satisfy these conditions at all .",

    "it is straightforward to show that the graphs with non - zero number of the external matter legs , possessing @xmath54 together with @xmath55 or @xmath56 , in the worst case , are only logarithmically divergent . applying the arguments from the previous section , one can convince oneself that in this case the one - loop graphs are finite .",
    "it remains to study the graphs with zero number of external matter legs .",
    "the leading uv divergence for them is @xmath57 ( one external @xmath58 leg ) , corresponding to a tadpole graph which vanishes identically .",
    "what comes next are graphs with two external @xmath58 legs which are superficially uv linearly divergent .",

    "consists in the investigation of the two - loop corrections to the effective action , as we pointed out earlier .",
