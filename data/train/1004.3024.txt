    "stability is a main characteristic of quantum mechanical systems in absence of interaction .",
    "when interaction with an environment is introduced to such systems , they tend to dissipate . a material body , for instance , an excited atom or molecule , or an excited nucleon , changes of state in reason of its interaction with the environment .",
    "the nature of the destabilization mechanism is in general model dependent and approximate .",
    "an account on the subject , in particular applied to the study of the brownian motion , can be found for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite . however , stability ( or not ) of quantum mechanical systems is not due only to the absence ( or presence ) of interaction .",
    "for example , the behavior of atoms confined in small cavities is completely different from the behavior of an atom in free space or in a large cavity . in the first case ,",
    "the decay process is inhibited by the presence of boundaries , a fact that has been pointed out since a long time ago in the literature @xcite , while in the second case it completely decays after a sufficiently long elapsed time .",
    "this phenomenon of inhibition of decay and related aspects have also been investigated in @xcite using a `` dressed state '' formalism introduced in @xcite . with this formalism one",
    "recovers the experimental observation that excited states of atoms in sufficiently small cavities are stable . in @xcite , formulas are obtained for the probability of an atom to remain excited for an infinitely long time , provided it is placed in a cavity of appropriate size . for an emission frequency in the visible red ,",
    "the size of such cavity is in good agreement with experimental observations @xcite .",
    "the dressed state formalism accounts for the fact that , for instance , a charged physical particle is always coupled to the gauge field ; in other words , it is always `` dressed '' by a cloud of field quanta . in general",
    ", for a system of matter particles , the idea is that the particles are coupled to an environment , which is usually modeled in two equivalent ways : either to represent it by a free field , as was done in refs .",
    "@xcite , or to consider the environment as a reservoir composed of a large number of noninteracting harmonic oscillators ( see , for instance ,  @xcite ) . in both cases ,",
    "exactly the same type of argument given above in the case of a charged particle applies to such systems .",
    "we may speak of the `` dressing '' of the set of particles by the ensemble of the harmonic modes of the environment .",
    "it should be noticed that our dressed states are _ not _ the same as those employed in optics and in the realm of general physics usually associated to normal coordinates @xcite .",
    "our dressed states are given in terms of our dressed coordinates and can be viewed as a rigorous version of these dressing procedures , in the context of the model employed here ( see eqs .",
    "( [ qvestidas1 ] ) and ( [ ortovestidas1 ] ) in the next section ) .    in the present paper",
    "we study the time evolution of a two - atom dressed state .",
    "this generalizes a previous work dealing with the simpler situation of a superposition of states of just one atom @xcite .",
    "our approach to this problem makes use of the above mentioned concept of dressed states .",
    "we will consider our system as consisting of two atoms , each one of them interacting independently with an environment provided by the harmonic modes of a field .",
    "the whole system is supposed to reside in a spherical cavity of radius @xmath0 .",
    "we take it as a bipartite system , each subsystem consisting of one of the dressed atoms .",
    "we will consider a superposition of two kinds of states : either all entities ( both atoms and the field modes ) are in their ground states , or just one of the atoms lies in its first excited state , the other one and all the field modes being in their ground states .",
    "the analysis of the density matrix of the system leads to the time evolution of the superposed states .",
    "the computation of the von neumann entropy leads to the result that it remains unchanged as the system evolves , for a cavity of any size .",
    "we find rather contrasting behaviors for the time evolution of the system for a very large cavity ( free space , @xmath1 ) or for a small cavity . in the first case , as time goes on , the system dissipates completely , while for a small cavity the departure from the idempotency of the density matrix exhibits an oscillatory behavior , never reaching zero .",
    "the dressing formalism for just one atom inside a cavity is briefly reviewed in section 2 in order to establish basic notation and formulas for the time evolution of the states . in section 3 ,",
    "the formalism is generalized for the two - atom system and describe the evolution of its density matrix , either in the case of a very large cavity ( with infinite radius , that is , free space ) or of a small cavity . in section 4 , we present our conclusions .",
    "let us briefly recall here some results from the analysis of previous works for the simpler situation of just one atom , dressed by its interaction with the environment field .",
    "we shall thus consider an atom in the harmonic approximation , linearly coupled to an environment modeled by the infinite set of harmonic modes of a scalar field , inside a spherical cavity .",
    "a nonperturbative study of the time evolution of such a system is implemented by means of _ dressed _ states and _ dressed _ coordinates .",
    "we present , in this section , a short review of this formalism , for details see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we consider an atom labeled @xmath2 , having _ bare _",

    "the invariance of the ground state is due to our definition of dressed coordinates given by eq .",
    "( [ qvestidas1 ] ) .",
    "notice that the introduction of the dressed coordinates implies , differently from the bare vacuum , the stability of the dressed vacuum state since , by construction , it is identical to the ground state of the interacting hamiltonian in terms of normal coordinates .",
    "each function @xmath71 describes a state in which the _ dressed _",
    "oscillator @xmath72 is in its @xmath73-th excited state .",
    "the particular dressed state @xmath74 at @xmath75 , represented by the wave function @xmath76 , describes the configuration in which _ only _ the @xmath67-th dressed oscillator is in the _ first _ excited level , all others being in their ground states .",
    "it is shown in ref .",

    "we now consider a bipartite system composed of two subsystems , @xmath85 and @xmath86 ; the subsystems consist respectively of dressed atoms @xmath87 and @xmath88 , in the sense defined in the preceding section , with @xmath89 labeling the quantities referring to the subsystems .",

    "following we consider each atom carrying its own dressing field ( a `` cloud '' of field quanta ) , independently of each other .",
    "this means that we are taking the approximation of neglecting the interaction ( via the field clouds ) between them .",

    "fock states of each individual dressed atom , @xmath87 or @xmath88 , possess the representation and properties presented in the last section .",
    "although it is spanned by direct products of fock states of the parts , the hilbert space of a bipartite system is not simply the direct product of the hilbert spaces of the separated parts ; it incorporates the entangled states as well .",
    "this is because quantum mechanics relies on the assumption that a linear combination of possible states of a given system is also an acceptable state of the system .",
    "therefore , many states of a bipartite system are not separable , they can not be reduced to an element of the direct product of the hilbert spaces of the separated parts ; they are entangled states which can only be conceived in a quantum mechanical framework .",
    "we shall now concentrate in a simple family of entangled states of the two dressed atom system .",
    "let us consider at time @xmath64 , a family of superposed states of the bipartite system given by @xmath95 where @xmath96 .",
    "in this expression , @xmath97 and @xmath98 stand respectively for the states in which the dressed atom @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) is at the first level , the dressed atom @xmath88 ( @xmath87 ) and all the field modes being in the ground state .",
    "they are @xmath99 note that , for @xmath100 and @xmath101 , states  ( [ definition - entangled - state ] ) are similar to states of the bell basis of a bipartite system .",
    "the two atoms are nondirectly interacting , they carry their own dressing fields ( a cloud of field quanta ) . the central point , which is in the heart of the notion of entanglement , is that they share the same common wavefunction @xmath102 , the superposed state . in other words , we attribute physical reality to the superposition of the two - atom state @xmath103 , in which atom @xmath88 is at the first excited level and the atom @xmath87 in the ground state , with the other state @xmath104 , in which the atom @xmath87 is at the first excited level and the atom @xmath88 in the ground state ; afterwards , we study the time evolution of the system initially described by the wavefunction eq .",
    "( [ definition - entangled - state ] ) .",
    "the field modes are all taken to be in the ground state , which means that we are considering the system at zero temperature .",
    "since there is no interaction between them , the atoms can not , in both classical or field - theoretical sense , influence one another , but as they are described by the same wavefunction , they are in the same superposed state and they can share _ information _ ( not mediated by field forces ) . as largely stated in the literature ,",
    "this is one of the more intriguing aspects of quantum mechanics ; the correlations predicted by the theory are not compatible with the current idea that the state of a system , in particular exchange of information among its subsystems , should be mediated by interactions among them .",
    "this leads still nowadays to different , yet controversial interpretations of quantum mechanics .    in spite of the simplicity of the model",
    ", it is widely assumed that a pair of harmonic oscillators is a good approximation in the case of simple atoms , for applications in quantum computing and for experiments with trapped ions .",
    "indeed , in the realm of quantum computation  @xcite , a situation nearly equivalent to the one we investigate here is studied .",
    "two noninteracting qubits , initially prepared in an entangled state , are _ coupled to their own independent environments _ and evolve under their influence .",

    "very different behaviors are obtained for this time evolution . in the large - cavity case ,",
    "the system shows dissipation , and , with the passing of time , both atoms go to their ground states . for a small cavity ,",

    "we find that the initial entanglement of the two atoms remains unchanged as the system evolves , for a cavity of any size , in the approximation of noninteracting dressed atoms .",
    "this could be related to the fact that for multipartite systems the superposition principle leads naturally to entangled states ; in this case noninteracting subsystems can thus share entangled states that hold quantum correlations .",
    "such quantum entanglement carries nonlocal features which can be analyzed by comparison with classical correlations @xcite .",

    "we would like to emphasize that we here consider entanglement as a pure quantum effect , a characteristic of quantum mechanics , which is also nonlocal , in the sense that distant and non - interacting systems may be entangled .",

    "quantum entanglement is approached for an ensemble of noninteracting electrons .",

    "<S> we verify that the von neumann entropy for such a system does not depend on time , nor on the size of the cavity . </S>"
