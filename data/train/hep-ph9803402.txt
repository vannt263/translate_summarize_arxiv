    "weak radiative hyperon decays ( wrhd s ) present a challenge to our theoretical understanding .",
    "despite many years of theoretical studies , a satisfactory description of these processes is still lacking . for a review see ref.@xcite where current theoretical and experimental situation in the field is presented .",
    "the puzzle posed by wrhd s manifests itself as a possible conflict between hara s theorem @xcite and experiment .",
    "hara s theorem is formulated in the language of local field theory at hadron level , and is based on cp- and gauge- invariance .",
    "it states that the parity - violating amplitude of the @xmath3 decay should vanish in the limit of su(3 ) flavour symmetry . for expected weak breaking of su(3 ) symmetry the parity - violating amplitude in question and , consequently",
    ", the @xmath3 decay asymmetry should be small .",
    "experiment @xcite shows , however , that the asymmetry is large : @xmath4 .",
    "explanation of such a large value of this asymmetry is even more difficult when one demands a successful simultaneous description of the experimental values of the asymmetries of three related wrhd s , namely @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "theoretical calculations may be divided into those performed totally at quark level ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) and those ultimately carried out at hadron level ( eg .",
    "hadron - level calculations are based on the pole model , with hara s theorem usually satisfied by construction .",
    "the only exception is the hadron - level vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) symmetry approach of ref.@xcite which admits a pole - model interpretation and yet violates the theorem . on the other hand , quark model calculation of ref.@xcite ( and its phenomenological applications @xcite ) , in spite of",
    "being explicitly cp- and gauge- invariant , directly violate the theorem .",
    "the problem is further confounded by the fact that experiment seems to agree with the predictions of the quark ( or vmd ) model , and not with those of the pole model satisfying hara s theorem .",
    "putting aside the approach of ref.@xcite , for known pole and quark models there exists an important difference between their predictions concerning the pattern of the signs of asymmetries in the four wrhd s mentioned above . for the set of asymmetries ( @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) the pole model",
    "@xcite predicts the pattern @xmath8 , while the quark model @xcite gives @xmath9",
    ". experiment ( and in particular the sign of the @xmath6 asymmetry @xcite ) hints @xcite that it is the latter alternative that is realized in nature .",
    "apart from the quark model , there are two other approaches that yield the pattern @xmath9 .",
    "the first one is the hadron - level @xmath10 vmd approach of ref.@xcite which so far gives the best description of data @xcite .",
    "the other is a diquark approach of ref.@xcite .",
    "the vmd prescription seems to violate hara s theorem as well .",
    "although a connection between the quark model and vmd result has been proposed @xcite , closer inspection @xcite reveals that the origin of the violation of hara s theorem is slightly different in the two models . in the quark model ,",
    "the violation of hara s theorem arises from bremsstrahlung diagrams in which photon is emitted from one of the pair of quarks exchanging the @xmath11-boson .",
    "the violation is connected with the intermediate quark entering its mass - shell in the @xmath12 limit .",
    "the @xmath13vmd approach ( related by symmetry to the standard pole model of nonleptonic hyperon decays ) admits a pole - model interpretation .",
    "then , the intermediate state is an excited @xmath14 state which is not degenerate with external ground state baryon .",
    "hence , the intermediate excited baryon state can not be on its mass shell .    the diquark approach @xcite contains a few free parameters , among them the masses of spin 0 and spin 1 diquarks . in the limit when these masses are equal to each other the approach yields the pattern @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , all parity violating amplitudes are then proportional to the @xmath15 mass difference and , consequently , hara s theorem is satisfied .",
    "the pattern @xmath9 for the diquark approach looks a little bit like an accident since it holds only when spin  0 - spin  1 symmetry is satisfied . still , the result of ref.@xcite poses the question if one can find other models which satisfy hara s theorem and yet give the pattern @xmath9 .",
    "specifically , the question that we put forward in this paper is : can the phenomenological success of vmd @xcite be consistent with hara s theorem",
    "? we will show that the answer to this question is `` yes '' .",
    "however , consistency of the phenomenological success of the @xmath16 vmd approach with hara s theorem implies that _ dominant parts of parity violating wrhd s amplitudes ( as well as those of nonleptonic hyperon decays ) must vanish in the su(3 ) limit_. this markedly differs from the way in which hara s theorem is satisfied in the standard pole model of ref.@xcite .",
    "that is , in ref.@xcite it is only the @xmath3 parity violating amplitude that vanishes in the su(3 ) limit , while three remaining relevant wrhd parity - violating amplitudes remain constant and nonzero .",
    "the difference between the pole model of ref.@xcite and the pole model considered in this paper is connected to the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath17 couplings . throughout this paper",
    ", all our formulas will be consistent with hara s theorem : we will not refer to ref.@xcite otherwise than in a discussion .",
    "let us consider parity - violating , cp - conserving interaction of a photon with spin @xmath18 baryons .",
    "the most general conserved electromagnetic axial current of spin @xmath18 baryons may be written in this case as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and we use conventions of ref.@xcite for @xmath21 matrices .",
    "note the factor of @xmath22 in the first term of eq.([eq : j5standard ] ) .",
    "indices @xmath23 label initial and final baryons and may be different ( eg . @xmath24 , etc . ) .",
    "hermiticity and cp invariance of @xmath25 coupling require functions @xmath26 , @xmath27 to be real ( see eg .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , @xmath26 is symmetric and @xmath27 antisymmetric in baryon indices : @xmath28 for real photons ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) the coupling to a photon of the first term in eq.([eq : j5standard ] ) vanishes .",
    "thus , the only contribution may come from the second term .",
    "theorem @xcite states that in the su(3 ) limit the function @xmath31 must vanish .",
    "the reason is simple : in the su(3 ) limit wave functions of @xmath32 and @xmath33 must be identical since they are obtained from each other by a simple replacement @xmath34 . furthermore , photon is a u - spin singlet .",
    "thus , function @xmath35 must be proportional to @xmath36 ( apart from the cabibbo factor , nothing changes when we replace @xmath37 by @xmath38 in @xmath32 ) .",
    "because of its antisymmetry the function @xmath36 is , however , zero .",
    "this proof does not specify , however , in what way the function @xmath31 vanishes .",
    "furthermore , it says nothing about functions @xmath39 for the remaining three wrhd s : @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .    in the pole model of ref.@xcite wrhd",
    "s proceed in two stages : a virtual decay of the initial ground - state baryon @xmath40 into a photon and an excited spin @xmath14 @xmath41 baryon followed by a weak interaction transforming the latter into a final ground - state baryon @xmath42 ( a reverse order of interactions is of course also taken into account ) . to describe these processes one has to know in particular the @xmath43 couplings .    in ref.@xcite",
    "these couplings are given in the form of a parity - conserving interaction of the photon with a current whose form ( after setting @xmath44 ) is fully analogous to eq.([eq : j5standard ] ) : @xmath45 where a pair of indices @xmath46 , @xmath47 denotes a pair of baryons @xmath48 , @xmath41 under consideration , ie .",
    "( @xmath46,@xmath47 ) @xmath49 ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 ) or ( @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) .",
    "following ref.@xcite one can check that hermiticity and cp invariance of @xmath54 coupling require function @xmath55 to be purely imaginary and symmetric : @xmath56 in ref.@xcite the corresponding function is stated to be real and antisymmetric .",
    "this difference is inessential because one can always absorb our purely imaginary phase of @xmath55 into the definition of the spinor of the intermediate excited state .",
    "the relation valid for both our convention and that of ref.@xcite is @xmath57 .",
    "there is one problem with eq.([eq : jpcgavela ] ) that was not discussed in ref.@xcite at all : the form of the right - hand side of eq.([eq : jpcgavela ] ) is the most general form for the situation under consideration .",
    "in fact , eq.([eq : jpcgavela ] ) is fully correct only when particles @xmath41 , @xmath48 are _ on their mass shells_. in the pole model , however , the intermediate excited states are certainly not on their mass shells .",
    "thus , the use of eq.([eq : jpcgavela ] ) is not fully justified .",
    "to substantiate our claim we shall consider the current : @xmath58 which is quadratic in external momenta .",
    "as before , @xmath59 = @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "hermiticity and cp invariance of the coupling of @xmath62 to a photon require @xmath63 to be purely imaginary and antisymmetric ( @xmath64 in phase - convention - independent form ) .",
    "we observe that a form totally analogous to eq.([eq : j1pc ] ) might also be used as an axial current relevant for describing the parity violating coupling of a photon to ground - state baryons : @xmath65 with initial and final spin @xmath18 baryons @xmath66 .",
    "hermiticity and cp invariance of @xmath67 interaction require @xmath68 to be real and symmetric : @xmath69 using the identity @xmath70 it is straightforward to show that @xmath71 thus , for particles @xmath46 , @xmath47 on their mass shell the current @xmath72 of eq.([eq : j5tilde ] ) reduces to the current @xmath73 of eq.([eq : j5standard ] ) with @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "interaction with real transverse photons of the first term on the rhs of eq.([eq : basicidentity ] ) vanishes . as to the second term",
    ", please note that the obtained function @xmath39 is antisymmetric and that it vanishes for equal masses of baryons @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "although for the parity - conserving current @xmath76 the identity of eq.([eq : basicidentity ] ) also holds , in the pole model of wrhd s one can not in general replace @xmath77 and @xmath78 by the corresponding baryon masses : the intermediate baryons @xmath41 are not on their mass shell .",
    "we shall see later what are the consequences of this lack of sufficient generality of the current of eq.([eq : jpcgavela ] ) .",
    "the pole model is built from two basic building blocks .",
    "the first describes weak interaction , the second - electromagnetic emission of a photon .",
    "parity violation comes from weak interactions which transform ground - state baryons into excited spin @xmath14 baryons and vice versa .",
    "the parity - violating weak transitions are described by @xmath79 where the pair of indices @xmath46 , @xmath47 describes a pair of baryons ( @xmath48,@xmath41 ) , ie .",
    "@xmath59 @xmath80 @xmath60 or @xmath61 . hermiticity and cp invariance require @xmath81 to be purely imaginary and antisymmetric : @xmath82 ( again we differ in conventions with ref.@xcite where @xmath81 is real and symmetric .",
    "a convention - independent condition is @xmath83 . )",
    "the electromagnetic emission is described by coupling the photon to the sum @xmath84 of currents of eqs.([eq : jpcgavela],[eq : j1pc ] ) : @xmath85    the calculation of ref.@xcite corresponds to @xmath86 , @xmath87 and leads to the pattern @xmath8 ( see eg .",
    "ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since this case was studied elsewhere @xcite , we will consider it only in a discussion , a little later .",
    "the really novel feature is the first term ( @xmath63 ) on the right hand side of eq.([eq : gencurrent ] ) .",
    "we turn now to the evaluation of its effects .",
    "we will show that this term generates asymmetry pattern @xmath9 .",
    "there are two pole - model diagrams ( fig.1a , b ) contributing to the decay @xmath88 .",
    "the amplitude corresponding to these diagrams is built from our basic blocks in a simple way .",
    "weak interaction ( symbolized by blobs in fig.1 ) is described by eq.([eq : weak ] ) while the electromagnetic current by eq.([eq : gencurrent ] ) .",
    "in addition , there must be a pole factor @xmath89 corresponding to the propagation of the off - shell excited baryon @xmath41 .    using the first term ( @xmath62 ) of the current of eq.([eq : gencurrent ] )",
    "the following expression corresponds then to fig .",
    "1a : @xmath90 where @xmath91 labels intermediate excited states ( summation over admissible @xmath91 is implied ) .",
    "the contribution corresponding to fig .",
    "1b is @xmath92 with appropriate @xmath93 , different from that in eq.([eq : expfig1a ] ) .",
    "however , since we are mainly concerned with the limit @xmath94 , for our purposes it is sufficient to consider @xmath18 @xmath95 @xmath14 mass splitting to be much larger than @xmath15 .",
    "thus , we may put the same @xmath93 everywhere . upon summing the above two contributions and replacing the factor @xmath96 by @xmath97",
    ", we act with @xmath98 on @xmath99 ( @xmath100 ) for the contributions of fig 1a ( 1b ) respectively . this yields @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) . using @xmath103 and @xmath104",
    "we obtain the total pole - model contribution from @xmath63 terms : @xmath105 now , for real photons and external baryons on their mass shell the factor in front of the braces in eq.([eq : totalf1 ] ) can be reduced using eq.([eq : basicidentity ] ) . in this way , eq.([eq : totalf1 ] ) is brought into our final form and the parity - violating wrhd amplitude is obtained from : @xmath106 as eq.([eq : finalform ] ) shows , parity - violating wrhd amplitudes vanish now in the limit @xmath107 .",
    "furthermore , this vanishing does not come about as a result of the cancellation between the contributions from the @xmath37- and @xmath108- channel poles as in ref.@xcite .",
    "in fact , for @xmath109 the denominators of the two terms in braces are identical and the same can be shown to hold for the numerators since : 1 ) @xmath110 and 2 ) @xmath111 leads to @xmath112 .",
    "one can also easily see that under @xmath113 interchange the expression in braces in eq.([eq : finalform ] ) is symmetric , ie .",
    "@xmath114 , and therefore the whole expression @xmath115 is antisymmetric , in agreement with the second of eqs.([eq : symprop ] ) .",
    "let us now try to use the current @xmath62 while putting intermediate baryons @xmath41 on their mass shell . for real transverse photons the current @xmath62 of eq.([eq : j1pc ] )",
    "may be then reexpressed using the simplified version of eq.([eq : basicidentity ] ) : @xmath116 for ( @xmath66 ) = ( @xmath117 ) or ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic currents in eqs.([eq : expfig1a],[eq : expfig1b ] ) are then replaced by @xmath119 for fig .",

    "1b ( eq.([eq : expfig1b ] ) ) .",
    "please note that now the factors @xmath121 multiplying spinorial expressions in eqs.([eq : gavfig1a],[eq : gavfig1b ] ) have symmetry properties of the @xmath55 factors , ie .",
    "they are symmetric under @xmath122 interchange , as in eq.([eq : f2 ] ) .",
    "we might write @xmath123 and @xmath124 with @xmath125 symmetric , and thus fully analogous to @xmath55 in eqs.([eq : jpcgavela],[eq : gencurrent ] ) .",
    "consequently , results of ref.@xcite should follow . indeed ,",
    "applying the procedure described above for the true current @xmath62 we obtain now the counterpart of eq.([eq : finalform ] ) for the current of eqs.([eq : gavfig1a],[eq : gavfig1b ] ) : @xmath126    now , for @xmath109 the denominators of the two terms in eq.([eq : gavform ] ) are identical but the numerators differ in sign since : @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath127 .",
    "thus , for @xmath109 the two terms in eq.([eq : gavform ] ) cancel .",
    "this is precisely the case considered in ref.@xcite where only the current @xmath128 was considered and the cancellation between the two diagrams of fig.1 was invoked as a way in which hara s theorem is satisfied . in ref.@xcite such a cancellation does not occur , however , for the remaining three relevant wrhd s , namely @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "phenomenologically , the most successful model seems to be the vmd model of ref.@xcite ( and its update in ref.@xcite ) . in the vmd approach the crucial assumption ( apart from the vmd prescription )",
    "is the assumed @xmath129 symmetry relating wrhd s to the well measured experimentally nonleptonic hyperon decays ( nlhd s ) .",
    "thus , the size and the pattern of parity violating wrhd amplitudes are determined by symmetry from nlhd s .",
    "the symmetry structure of the parity - violating wrhd and nlhd amplitudes of refs.@xcite may be understood in terms of the pole model . in view of :    \\(1 ) considerations of the preceding section in which two different possible patterns of wrhd asymmetries were obtained in the pole model , and    \\(2 ) the symmetry connection between wrhd s and nlhd s that forms the basis of the successful approach of refs.@xcite    it is pertinent to discuss nonleptonic hyperon decays in the pole model along the lines of the preceding section and to study the relation between the symmetry structures of wrhd s and nlhd s .",
    "this is what we will turn to now .",
    "for the sake of further discussion let us assume that masses of octet pseudoscalar mesons are negligible , @xmath130 .",

    "the couplings of eq.([eq : pvnlhdstandard ] ) arise from the parity - violating weak transition of eq.([eq : weak ] ) followed by parity - conserving @xmath146 ( or @xmath135 ) emission from the excited spin @xmath14 baryon ( a reverse order of interactions is also taken into account ) .",
    "consider parity - conserving @xmath132 emission couplings described by : @xmath147 with @xmath148 or @xmath61 .",
    "hermiticity and cp - invariance require all @xmath149 to be real with @xmath150 , @xmath151 symmetric and @xmath152 asymmetric under @xmath153 interchange . since excited intermediate spin @xmath14 baryon is not on its mass shell we are not allowed to replace eq.([eq : pcexcited ] ) by a momenta - independent form analogous to eq.([eq : pvnlhdstandard ] ) .",
    "( in eq.([eq : pcexcited ] ) we have neglected an a priori possible term @xmath154 ; calculation shows that its effect is fully analogous to that of the @xmath155 term . )",
    "working out the pole model contributions from various terms of eq.([eq : pcexcited ] ) we obtain ( as in the previous section )    \\(1 ) from the @xmath155 term : @xmath156 with the factor in braces antisymmetric under @xmath113 interchange ( this is the term usually considered in papers on nonleptonic hyperon decays ) ,    \\(2 ) from the @xmath157 term @xmath158 with the factor in braces symmetric under @xmath113 interchange ,    \\(3 ) from the @xmath159 term @xmath160\\left \\ { \\frac{f^{(2)}_{fk^*}a_{k^*i}}{m_i - m_{k^*}}+ \\frac{a_{fk^*}f^{(2)}_{k^*i}}{m_f - m_{k^ * } } \\right \\ } \\overline{u}_fu_ip^0\\ ] ] with the factor in braces antisymmetric under @xmath113 interchange .",
    "thus , the pole model yields specific predictions for @xmath139 , @xmath141 , and @xmath140 of eq.([eq : pvnlhdstandard ] ) , which are given by factors in braces in eqs.([eq : fromf0],[eq : fromf1 ] , [ eq : fromf2 ] ) .",
    "assuming now that one of the two patterns of parity - violating nlhd amplitudes ( corresponding to the symmetry or antisymmetry of the factor in braces ) is dominant , there appears the question which pattern is actually realized in nature .",
    "calculations of desplanques , donoghue and holstein ( ref.@xcite ) and those of ref.@xcite correspond to the pattern obtained from terms @xmath155 or @xmath159 , which coincides with the predictions of current algebra . for the sake of comparison with eqs.([eq : fromf0],[eq : fromf1],[eq : fromf2 ] ) in table i we give a few selected amplitudes corresponding to the symmetry pattern of these references .",

    "although @xmath11-exchange seems to contribute to diagram ( 1b ) only , this does not mean that individual contributions from @xmath11-exchange with nonstrange intermediate excited baryons are all zero .",
    "they do not vanish but they all cancel among themselves ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . experimental data on nlhd s can not determine which of the two patterns ( corresponding to @xmath172 or @xmath157 ) is correct .",
    "this is so because in all @xmath146 emission amplitudes the @xmath170-terms come solely from diagrams ( 1b ) and the @xmath171-terms - solely from diagrams ( 1a ) . since the size and sign of @xmath171 is a phenomenological parameter it is impossible to differentiate between the two patterns .",
    "if @xmath135 ( @xmath173 ) emission were kinematically allowed , this would be possible : cancellation of two contributions to the @xmath174 amplitude would be replaced by constructive interference from diagrams ( 1a ) and ( 1b ) .",
    "let us now go back to wrhd s .",
    "the connection between nlhd s and wrhd s is achieved in ref.@xcite by considering the combined flavour - spin symmetry @xmath129 .",
    "this symmetry is suited for the description of two - body decays because spin generators of @xmath175 commute with lorentz boosts along decay axis @xcite . consequently , if one wants to apply @xmath175 it is appropriate to choose one of lorentz frames obtained from the initial particle rest frame by boosts along decay axis .",
    "thus , we choose any frame in which @xmath176 with arbitrary @xmath177 .",
    "for further discussion let us recall the following identity : @xmath178    after fixing the gauge to be the coulomb one ( @xmath179 , @xmath180 ) , the second term on the right hand side of eq.([eq : sigmagammaident ] ) decouples from the photon .",
    "thus , in the @xmath175-symmetric framework , the terms @xmath181 and @xmath182 lead to amplitudes proportional to each other , the coefficient of proportionality being @xmath183 .",
    "consequently , the model of ref.@xcite ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) generates the same amplitudes as @xmath184 where @xmath185 denotes the term ( asymmetric under @xmath113 interchange ) in braces in eq.([eq : gavform ] ) with @xmath186 replaced by @xmath187 . for the present paper ( @xmath188 , @xmath189 ) , eq.([eq : finalform ] )",

    ", the factors @xmath195 do not vanish for @xmath196 .",
    "symmetry properties of factors @xmath197 and @xmath198 are identical and , consequently , they lead to the same pattern of asymmetries : @xmath9 . on the other hand , dominance of the @xmath199 term would lead to the pattern @xmath8 .",
    "if new experiments confirm the pattern @xmath9 which seems to be favoured by the older data ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it will mean that the dominant parts of parity violating wrhd amplitudes are proportional to an power of @xmath183 .",
    "thus , one of two possibilities below must hold .",
    "either    \\(1 ) hara s theorem is violated as in the quark model calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath200 , or    \\(2 ) hara s theorem is satisfied as a byproduct of vanishing ( in the limit @xmath107 ) of parity - violating wrhd amplitudes .",
    "( this vanishing may be approximate for those decays where a nonzero @xmath199 of eq.([eq : gavgamma ] ) may contribute ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath201 , @xmath202 . in this case",
    ", the observed large asymmetry of @xmath203 decay should not surprise us too much .",
    "to say that the size of the relevant parity - violating amplitude is `` large '' means that we have to compare it with some standard size .",
    "thus , we should compare the @xmath203 amplitude with other parity - violating amplitudes of wrhd s .",
    "however , since they all vanish in the su(3 ) limit in the same way as the @xmath204 amplitude does , the relative size of the latter amplitude is large indeed .    within the @xmath16 vmd approach one expects that in nlhd s and wrhd s the terms of the same order in @xmath183 are symmetry - related .",
    "thus , if @xmath16 vmd predictions for the wrhd asymmetries are borne out by the data and one insists that hara s theorem is to be satisfied , this would mean that only the contributions from @xmath159 terms should be present in nlhd s and that , consequently , the parity - violating nlhd amplitudes should vanish in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "however , since the mass of the decaying particle is not a free parameter , one can not differentiate between contributions of type @xmath155 and @xmath159 using data on hyperon nonleptonic decays alone .",
    "nonetheless , instead of considering @xmath205 decays , one may study @xmath206 parity - violating @xmath207 couplings , and try to see if mass - dependence characteristic of @xmath159 ( or perhaps @xmath157 ) terms is present in these couplings . in theoretical calculations mass - dependence characteristic of the @xmath157 term",
    "was obtained in the past @xcite , leading to @xmath208 of order @xmath209 @xmath210 times the `` best values '' of ref.@xcite .",
    "if the nlhd and wrhd amplitudes are indeed proportional to @xmath211 as the signature @xmath9 and insistence on satisfying hara s theorem would demand , then one would expect totally negligible weak parity - violating @xmath212 and @xmath213 couplings . at present , data seem to indicate that these couplings , although somewhat smaller than the `` best value '' prediction of ref.@xcite , are nonetheless of the same order @xcite",
    ". totally negligible value of weak @xmath214 coupling is also possible @xcite .",
    "however , the general order of magnitude of @xmath207 couplings is consistent with the lack of the @xmath211 factor @xcite .",
    "hence , although in principle it is possible that the signature @xmath9 for the wrhd asymmetries is consistent with hara s theorem , the underlying approach leads then to negligible weak @xmath207 couplings in disagreement with experiment .",
    "we have studied parity - violating wrhd amplitudes in the pole model . in this model",
    "the properties of these amplitudes depend on the properties of the parity - conserving @xmath0 couplings .",
    "two different conserved electromagnetic local baryonic currents have been used for the description of the transition of an on - shell ground - state baryon into an off - shell excited baryon ( or vice versa ) .",
    "although the two currents become indistinguishable for a transition between on - shell baryons , they are inequivalent when baryons are off - shell . as a result ,",
    "the two currents lead to different patterns of asymmetries in weak radiative hyperon decays .",
    "we have shown that in the pole model with hara s theorem explicitly satisfied it is still possible to obtain the asymmetry pattern @xmath9 that is characteristic of the quark model .",
    "thus , the pattern @xmath9 is not an unmistakable sign of the violation of hara s theorem .",
    "phenomenological success of the @xmath10 vmd approach to wrhd s may be understood as being consistent with hara s theorem if the dominant parts of wrhd and nlhd parity - violating amplitudes vanish in the @xmath1 limit .",
    "although the success of the @xmath10 vmd approach does not necessarily demand violation of hara s theorem , it requires totally negligible weak @xmath207 couplings if hara s theorem is to be satisfied .",
    "data on hadronic parity violation indicate that no such suppression of @xmath207 couplings occurs in reality , however .",
    "thus , if the pattern @xmath9 of wrhd asymmetries ( ie . , especially , the positive sign of the @xmath6 asymmetry ) is confirmed , then , together with the non - negligible size of weak @xmath207 couplings this would indicate violation of hara s theorem .",
    "i would like to thank b. desplanques for bringing the identity of eq.([eq : sigmagammaident ] ) to my attention a few years ago , and ya .",
