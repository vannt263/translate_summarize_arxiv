    "the mathematical formulation of quantum gauge theories forms one of the great challenges in mathematical physics .",
    "recently , the perturbative structure of quantum yang  mills gauge theories has been more and more understood . on the one hand",
    ", many rigorous results can be obtained @xcite using cohomological arguments within the context of the brst - formalism @xcite . on the other hand , renormalization of perturbative quantum field theories has been carefully structured using hopf algebras @xcite .",
    "the presence of a gauge symmetry induces a rich additional structure on these hopf algebras , as has been explored in @xcite and in the author s own work @xcite .",
    "all of this work is based on the algebraic transparency of bphz - renormalization , with the hopf algebra reflecting the recursive nature of this procedure",
    ".    nevertheless , there are two objections to this approach to perturbative quantum field theories .",
    "firstly , it is defined in momentum space and one is thus restricted to quantum field theories on flat spacetime and , secondly , it is defined as a graph - by - graph procedure and not in terms of the  more physical  full green s functions . in this paper",
    ", we will address the second point and try to elucidate the hopf algebraic structure on the level of green s functions in gauge theories .",
    "the first point has been addressed in the series of papers @xcite and references therein , in the context of algebraic quantum field theories .",
    "the case of yang ",
    "mills theories was considered by hollands in @xcite .",
    "interesting to note is that the epstein ",
    "glaser renormalization involved in this approach has an underlying hopf algebraic structure as well @xcite ( see also @xcite for rooted trees instead of feynman graphs ) .",
    "the mainstream physics literature has taken a slightly different road to the perturbative approach to quantum gauge theories by putting functional integration techniques at its heart .",
    "although the formal path integral manipulations provide a powerful technique , it is hard to overestimate the importance of a transparent algebraic description of perturbative quantum gauge theories .    in this paper , we adopt the philosophy to put formal ( perturbative ) expansions in feynman graphs as a starting point and try to ( rigorously ) derive results from that , avoiding functional techniques completely .",
    "for instance , the process of ( bphz)-renormalization is captured by means of the connes ",
    "kreimer hopf algebra .",
    "as we will explain in section [ sect : prel ] below , this extends naturally to gauge theories .",
    "the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities for the couplings  the reminiscences of the gauge symmetry  are shown to be compatible with renormalization by establishing them as generators of a hopf ideal in this hopf algebra ( section [ sect : setup ] ) . in the corresponding quotient hopf algebra ,",
    "we find certain hopf subalgebras and we will show that their character group is a subgroup of the semidirect product of ( invertible ) formal power series with a formal diffeomorphism group . it should be noted that the existence of hopf subalgebras has already been studied in the context of dyson ",
    "schwinger equations in @xcite and in @xcite for planar rooted trees .",
    "also , our work reflects the semi - direct product considered in @xcite for a scalar field theory , and @xcite where the above groups of formal series and diffeomorphisms ( and their noncommutative analogues ) appears in the study of renormalization of quantum electrodynamics .    although the existence of the hopf ideals can be established rigorously by a combinatorial proof , it is crucial to have a more conceptual understanding of their origin",
    "this is what we do in the second part of the paper .",
    "namely , we connect the renormalization hopf algebras of gauge theories to the bv - algebras generated by the fields and coupling constants by making the latter a comodule bv - algebra over the hopf algebras ( section [ sect : coaction ] ) .",
    "the induced action of the character group can be understood as wave function renormalization ( invertible formal power series in @xmath0 variables ) and coupling constant renormalization ( formal diffeomorphisms of @xmath1 ) .",
    "the origin of the hopf ideals is clarified by identifying an ideal in the bv - algebra generated by the so - called master equation satisfied by the action .",
    "this ideal induces a hopf ideal in the renormalization hopf algebra which in the case of simple gauge theories coincides with the ideal generated by the slavnov ",
    "taylor identities for the couplings . on the level of the character group ,",
    "the @xmath0 parameters reduce to the subgroup in one parameter .",
    "this reflects the presence of a ` fundamental coupling constant ' in such theories , in terms of which all other coupling constants can be expressed .",
    "we conclude this section by discussing the renormalization group and the beta - function in this context . in section [",
    "sect : ym ] we exemplify our construction by working out explicitly the case of yang  mills gauge theory , with a simple lie group .",
    "the study of the effective action of gauge theories will be postponed to a second paper . in particular",
    ", we will study the zinn  justin equation from the hopf - algebraic point of view as well as its relation with the ( classical ) master equation ( cf .",
    "below ) satisfied by the action .",
    "let us briefly recall the role played by hopf algebras as coordinate rings on ( affine ) groups , while referring to @xcite for a complete treatment",
    ".    we will consider commutative algebras @xmath2 ( over @xmath3 ) for which the set of characters @xmath4 is actually a group .",
    "the group structure on @xmath5 induces the structure of a _",
    "hopf algebra _ on @xmath2 , that is , a counit , @xmath6 , a coproduct @xmath7 and an antipode @xmath8 .",
    "these are all algebra maps and are supposed to satisfy certain compatibility condition which we do not list here",
    ".    representations of @xmath5 correspond one - to - one to _ corepresentations _ of @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , if @xmath9 is a @xmath5-module , then it is also a _ comodule _ over @xmath2 , that is , there exists a map ( called _ coaction _ ) @xmath10 such that @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath9 has additional structure , it is natural to require the coaction to respect this structure",
    ".    we will further restrict our study to _ connected graded hopf algebras _ for which there is a grading @xmath12 that is respected by the product and the coproduct : @xmath13 and such that @xmath14",
    ". dually , graded hopf algebras correspond to ( pro)-unipotent groups .",
    "we illustrate the above definition somewhat elaborately by discussing in the next two subsections two examples that are relevant in what follows .",
    "we suppose that we have defined a ( renormalizable ) perturbative quantum field theory and specified the possible interactions between different types of fields .",
    "these fields are collected in a set @xmath15 whereas the different types of interactions  represented by vertices  constitute a set @xmath16 . in the lagrangian formalism , it is natural to associate to each vertex a local monomial in the fields ( present in the lagrangian ) ; we will denote this map by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is defined as the algebra of local polynomials in the fields @xmath19 ( see definition [ defn : localform ] below ) .",
    "propagators , on the other hand , are indicated by edges and form a set @xmath20 .",
    "again , one assigns a monomial to each edge via @xmath21 but now @xmath22 which is now of order 2 in the fields , involving precisely the field ( and its conjugate in the case of fermions ) that is propagating .",
    "we will assume that there are brst - source terms present in the theory , which means that for each field @xmath23 there is a corresponding source field @xmath24 in @xmath25 . in other words ,",
    "the set of fields is of the form @xmath26 this _ even - dimensionality _ is a manifestation of the structure on the fields of a gerstenhaber algebra which we will explore later .",
    "quantum electrodynamics describes the interaction of charged particles such as electrons with photons , with corresponding fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "their propagation is usually indicated by a straight and a wiggly line ( for the electron and photon , respectively ) .",
    "there is only the interaction of an electron emitting a photon : this is indicated by a vertex of valence three ; the mass term for the electron is indicated by a vertex of valence two .",
    "the dynamical and interactive character of the theory can be summarized by the following sets , @xmath29 the corresponding monomials in @xmath30)$ ] are @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 the electric charge and mass of the electron , respectively .",
    "quantum chromodynamics describes the strong interaction between quarks and gluons , described by the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively ( see section [ sect : ym ] below for more details ) .",
    "these are indicated by straight and wiggly lines .",
    "in addition , associated to the non - abelian gauge symmetry ( with symmetry group @xmath34 ) there is the so - called ghost field @xmath35 , indicated by dotted lines , as well as the brst - sources @xmath36 and @xmath37 . between the fields",
    "there are four interactions , three brst - source terms , and a mass term for the quark .",
    "this leads to the following sets of vertices and edges , @xmath38 note that the dashed edges do not appear in @xmath20 , i.e. the source terms do not propagate and in the following will not appear as internal edges of a feynman graph .",
    "[ rem : psipsibar ] although these examples motivate our construction , we stress that for what follows it is not necessary to specify the fields in the set @xmath25 nor the vertices and edges in @xmath39 explicitly .",
    "the relevant structure is encoded by the map @xmath40 .",
    "we note , however , that we make the following natural working assumptions :    1 .",
    "whenever a fermionic field , say @xmath27 , interacts at a vertex @xmath41 which does not involve a brst - source , then @xmath42 involves _ both _ @xmath27 and @xmath43 .",
    "there is only one vertex for every brst - source .",
    "there are no valence two vertices involving two different fields ( thus , still allowing mass terms ) .",
    "physically , the last condition means that we require order two polynomials other than mass terms in the lagrangian not to be radiatively corrected .    a _ feynman graph _",
    "is a graph built from the types of vertices present in @xmath16 and the types of edges present in @xmath20 .",
    "naturally , we demand edges to be connected to vertices in a compatible way , respecting the type of vertex and edge .",
    "as opposed to the usual definition in graph theory , feynman graphs have no external vertices .",
    "however , they do have _ external lines _ which come from vertices in @xmath44 for which some of the attached lines remain vacant ( i.e. no edge in @xmath20 attached ) .",
    "implicit in the construction is the fact that source terms only arise as external lines since they are not in @xmath20 , justifying the name source term.    if a feynman graph @xmath44 has two external lines , both corresponding to the same field , we would like to distinguish between propagators and mass terms .",
    "in more mathematical terms , since we have vertices of valence two , we would like to indicate whether a graph with two external lines corresponds to such a vertex , or to an edge .",
    "a graph @xmath44 with two external lines is dressed by a bullet when it corresponds to a vertex , i.e. we write @xmath45 .",
    "the above correspondence between feynman graphs and vertices / edges is given by the _ residue _",
    "it is defined as the vertex or edge the graph corresponds to after collapsing all its internal points .",
    "for example , we have : @xmath47    for the definition of the hopf algebra of feynman graphs , we restrict to _ one - particle irreducible _",
    "( 1pi ) feynman graphs .",
    "these are graphs that are not trees and can not be disconnected by cutting a single internal edge .    the hopf algebra of feynman graphs is the free commutative algebra @xmath2 over @xmath3 generated by all 1pi feynman graphs with residue in @xmath39 , with counit @xmath48 unless @xmath49 , in which case @xmath50 , coproduct , @xmath51 where the sum is over disjoint unions of 1pi subgraphs with residue in @xmath52 . the quotient @xmath53 is defined to be the graph @xmath44 with the connected components of the subgraph contracted to the corresponding vertex / edge .",
    "if a connected component @xmath54 of @xmath55 has two external lines , then there are possibly two contributions corresponding to the valence two vertex and the edge ; the sum involves the two terms @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
