    "the interaction of charged particles with a plasma in the presence of radiation field ( rf ) has been a subject of great activity , starting with the work of tavdgiridze , aliev , gorbunov and other authors @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of the quantities related to inelastic particle  solid and particle  plasma interactions , like scattering rates and differential and total mean free paths and energy losses , can be formulated in terms of the dielectric response function obtained from the electron gas model .",
    "the results have important applications in radiation and solid  state physics @xcite , and more recently , in studies of energy deposition by ion beams in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) targets @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the achievement of high  intensity laser beams with frequencies ranging between the infrared and vacuum  ultraviolet region has given rise to the possibility of new studies of interaction processes , such as electron ",
    "atom scattering in laser fields @xcite , multiphoton ionization @xcite , inverse bremsstrahlung and plasma heating @xcite , screening breakdown @xcite , and other processes of interest for applications in optics , solid  state , and fusion research .",
    "in addition , a promising icf scheme has been recently proposed @xcite , in which the plasma target is irradiated simultaneously by intense laser and ion beams . within this scheme several experiments @xcite have been performed to investigate the interactions of heavy ion and laser beams with plasma targets .",
    "an important aspect of these experiments is the energy loss measurements for the ions in a wide - range of plasma parameters .",
    "it is expected in such experiments that the ion propagation would be essentially affected by the parametric excitation of the plasma target by means of laser irradiation .",
    "this effect has been supported recently by particle - in - cell ( pic ) numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "in this paper we present a study of the effects of intense rf on the interaction of nonrelativistic projectile ions with an electron plasma .",
    "our objective is to study two regimes of the ion energy loss which have not been considered in detail .",
    "for the first part of our study , we consider energy loss of a slow ion .",
    "in particular , this is motivated by the fact that the alpha - particles resulting from the nuclear fusion in a very dense plasma with temperature in the kev range , display a velocity mostly below electron thermal velocity .",
    "the second objective of our study is to investigate the energy loss in high  velocity regime .",
    "previously this has been done for a classical plasma @xcite treating only the collective excitations as well as in the range of solid  state densities ( fully degenerate plasma ) and at the intermediate intensities of the rf @xcite when the electron quiver amplitude is comparable to the screening length of the target . to gain more insight into the rf effect on the energy loss process we consider here the regime of intense rf when the quiver amplitude largely exceeding the typical screening length of the fully degenerate electron plasma .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec:1 ] we briefly outline the rpa formulation for the energy loss of a heavy ion uniformly moving in a plasma in the presence of an intense rf .",
    "the limiting case of a weak rf is also considered . in secs .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and [ sec:3 ] we have calculated the effects of the rf on the mean energy loss ( stopping power ) of the test ion considering two somewhat distinct cases with slow ( sec .  [ sec:2 ] ) and fast ( sec .  [ sec:3 ] ) projectiles moving in a classical and fully degenerated electron gas , respectively .",
    "in the latter case the degenerated electron gas is treated within a simple plasmon  pole approximation proposed by basbas and ritchie @xcite .",
    "it has been shown , that besides usual stopping in a plasma it is possible to accelerate the charged particles beam through rf .",
    "this effect is expected for fast projectiles and in the high  intensity limit of the rf , when the  quiver velocity  of the plasma electrons exceeds the projectile ion velocity .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] which also includes discussion and outlook .",
    "the whole interaction process of the projectile ion with a plasma involves the energy loss and the charge states of the ion and  as an additional aspect  the ionization and recombination of the ion driven by the rf and the collisions with the plasma particles .",
    "a complete description of the interaction of the ion requires a simultaneous treatment of all these effects including , in particular , the effect of the ion charge equilibration on the energy loss process . in this paper",
    "we do not discuss the charge state evolution of the projectiles under study , but concentrate on the rf effects on the energy loss process assuming an equilibrium charge state of the ion with an effective charge @xmath3 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that the charge equilibration occurs in time scales which are usually much smaller than the time of passage of the ion through target .",
    "the problem is formulated using the random  phase approximation ( rpa ) , and includes the effects of the rf in a self  consistent way .",
    "the electromagnetic field is treated in the long  wavelength limit , and the electrons are considered nonrelativistic .",
    "these are good approximations provided that ( 1 ) the wavelength of the rf ( @xmath4 ) is much larger than the typical screening length ( @xmath5 with @xmath6 the mean velocity of the electrons and @xmath2 the plasma frequency ) , and ( 2 ) the  quiver velocity  of the electrons in the rf ( @xmath7 ) is much smaller than the speed of light @xmath8 .",
    "these conditions can be alternatively written as ( 1 ) @xmath9 , ( 2 ) @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the rf intensity . as an estimate in the case of dense gaseous plasma , with electron density @xmath12 @xmath13 , we get @xmath14 w/@xmath15 .",
    "thus the limits ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are well above the values obtained with currently available high  power rf sources , and so the approximations are well justified .",
    "we consider the time ",
    "dependent hamiltonian for the plasma electrons in the presence of both a radiation field ( rf ) with vector potential @xmath16 , and a self  consistent scalar potential @xmath17 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath18where @xmath19 , @xmath20 are annihilation and creation operators for electrons with momentum @xmath21 , respectively , and @xmath22 is the fourier transform of @xmath17 .",

    "we consider a heavy point  like particle with mass @xmath41 and effective charge @xmath3 which moves with rectilinear trajectory with constant velocity @xmath42 .",
    "we thus neglect the effect of the rf on the particle assuming that the quiver velocity of the ion in the laser field @xmath43 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the mean velocity of the target electrons .",
    "the charge density of the point  like ion is then given by @xmath44 .",

    "it is straightforward to calculate the electric field @xmath52 , and the time average ( with respect to the period @xmath53 of the laser field ) of the stopping field @xmath54 acting on the particle .",

    "<S> the inelastic interaction between heavy ions and an electron plasma in the presence of an intense radiation field ( rf ) is investigated . the stopping power of the test ion averaged with a period of the rf </S>",
    "<S> has been calculated assuming that @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the frequency of the rf and @xmath2 is the plasma frequency . in order to highlight the effect of the radiation field we present a comparison of our analytical and numerical results obtained for nonzero rf with those for vanishing rf . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the rf may strongly reduce the mean energy loss for slow ions while increasing it at high  velocities . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it has been shown , that acceleration of the projectile ion due to the rf is expected at high  velocities and in the high  intensity limit of the rf , when the quiver velocity of the plasma electrons exceeds the ion velocity .    * </S>",
