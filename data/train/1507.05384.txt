    "constraining quantitatively the symmetry energy @xmath2 of nuclear matter at saturation density @xmath3 and its density slope @xmath4 has been a major focus of attention in present - day nuclear physics .",
    "they are fundamental parameters in influencing the binding energies and stability of atomic nuclei and in shaping the isospin distributions there giving rise to neutron - skins ( @xmath5 ) in nuclei of large neutron excess @xcite , where @xmath5 is the difference between the rms radii for density distributions of the neutrons and protons in a nucleus .",
    "they are also of seminal importance in astronomical context .",
    "the interplay of gravitation with the pressure of neutron matter @xmath6 at @xmath3 is a determining factor in the radii of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "the dynamical evolution of the core - collapse of a massive star and the associated explosive nucleosynthesis depend sensitively on the slope parameter @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "it also controls the nature and stability of phases within a neutron star , its critical composition , thickness and frequencies of crustal vibration @xcite and determines the feasibility of direct urca cooling processes within its interior @xcite .",
    "the value of the symmetry energy coefficient @xmath8 has been known for some decades to be in the range of @xmath9 mev @xcite . in a controlled finite - range droplet model ( frdm ) from a fit of the observed nuclear masses , the uncertainty in its value shrunk appreciably , it was found to be @xmath10 mev @xcite .",
    "studying meticulously the double differences of symmetry energies estimated from experimental nuclear masses , jiang _",
    "et al _ @xcite find its value to be @xmath11 mev .",
    "their procedure takes advantage of the fact that other effects like pairing and shell corrections in symmetry energy are well cancelled out from double differences of neighboring nuclei .",
    "initial explorations on the symmetry slope @xmath7 , however , show wide variations .",
    "the suggested lower limit is @xmath12 mev , on the high side , it is @xmath13 mev @xcite .",
    "astrophysical observations of neutron star radii and masses provide @xcite a value of @xmath7 between 43 and 52 mev , though . on the other hand , correlation systematics of @xmath5 with nuclear isospin @xcite , isoscaling @xcite , nucleon emission ratios @xcite , isospin diffusion @xcite in heavy - ion collision , analysis of giant dipole resonance of @xmath0pb @xcite , giant quadrupole resonance in @xmath0pb @xcite , pigmy dipole resonance in @xmath14ni and @xmath15sn @xcite or of nuclear ground state properties using the standard skyrme hartree - fock approach @xcite , all yield values of @xmath7 that differ substantially from one another @xcite .",
    "efforts have also been made to constrain the value of @xmath7 by fitting the binding energies of large number of deformed nuclei within the density dependent point coupling model @xcite and by considering the pseudo data on the equation of state for the asymmetric nuclear matter or pure neutron matter in the fitting protocol of the skyrme models @xcite as well as the density dependent meson exchange models @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate that @xmath7 is in the range of 40 - 70 mev .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for this reasonable domain of the parameters the values of the symmetry energy slope parameter @xmath7 and the @xmath16 in the @xmath0pb nucleus are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "the inclined and elongated shapes of the ellipsoids indicate that the correlations amongst @xmath17 and @xmath18 are strong .",
    "in fact , the values of the correlation coefficients ( eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) ) for these pairs of quantities for both the models turn out to be @xmath190.95 .",
    "it is evident that the ellipsoids depicting the results for the model - ii ( color red ) are narrower in comparison to those for the model - i ( color blue ) .",
    "this is suggestive of the fact that the inclusion of the binding energies for the @xmath20o and @xmath21ne put tighter constraints on the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density .",
    "nuclear matter properties for model - i and model - ii are compared in table [ tab3 ] .",
    "errors on the entities describing the isoscalar behavior of nuclear matter ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath3 and @xmath24 ) are pretty much the same for both the models concerned . for model - ii , however , a significant improvement ( by a factor @xmath25 ) on the spread of parameters like @xmath8 and @xmath7 , which describe the symmetry behavior of nuclear matter , is achieved over model - i .",
    "strikingly , the errors on @xmath8 and @xmath7 for the model - ii agree very well with the ones obtained for the sami skyrme force @xcite which includes the variational eos for the pure neutron matter as pseudo data in the fitting protocol .",
    "we also provide the values of @xmath5 for @xmath26ca , @xmath15sn and @xmath0pb nuclei in table [ tab3 ] . the reduction in the errors on @xmath5 for the model - ii in comparison to those for the model - i are in harmony with the results depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .    to this end",
    ", it may be mentioned that the correlations of neutron - skin thickness in @xmath0pb nucleus with @xmath7 has been studied within the covariance approach for different nuclear energy density functionals @xcite .",
    "these correlations exhibit some degree of model dependence . in view of this",
    ", the present investigation should be extended to other energy density functionals .",
    "the value of @xmath7 might also be constrained by including in the fitting protocol the experimental data for the iso - vector giant dipole polarizability for the @xmath0pb nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , it must be reminded that the @xmath7 is well correlated with the product of dipole polarizability and the symmetry energy coefficient at the saturation density @xmath8 rather than the dipole polarizability alone @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we have tried to give a critical look on the question why the information content on the elements of symmetry energy do not get transported properly in the edfs when they are parametrized to reproduce the binding energies of representative nuclei in a mean - field model .",
    "the asymmetry parameters are then less constrained .",
    "working in the confines of rmf model , we find that better constraint can be achieved in the isovector part of the effective lagrangian density and hence in the said symmetry elements if one includes , in the fitting protocol of the microscopic model binding energies of some highly asymmetric nuclei . in this preliminary investigation ,",
    "comparison of results with two sets of nuclei , one a standard set and another with two additional nuclei of very high asymmetry ( @xmath27 ) shows a pointer in this direction .",
    "the covariance analysis yields the reduction in the uncertainties on the values of symmetry energy and its slope parameter by @xmath28 in comparison to those obtained without the inclusion of the additional nuclei in the fit data .",
    "similar effects are also observed on the values of @xmath5 in @xmath26ca , @xmath15sn and @xmath0pb nuclei .",
    "a more detailed analysis along this direction is underway ."
