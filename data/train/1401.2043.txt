    "the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire : @xcite ) is one of the three focal plane instruments on board the esa _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "spire consists of an imaging photometric camera and an imaging fourier - transform spectrometer ( fts ) .",
    "the fts works on the principle of interferometry : the incident radiation is separated in two beams that travel different optical paths before recombining .",
    "thus the signal , that is measured by the fts , is not the direct flux density in the passband , but the fourier component of the spectral content ( see @xcite and the spire observers manual for more details ) .",
    "the final fts spectra , after the inverse fourier transform , cover two wide frequency bands : slw ( 447990 ghz ) and ssw ( 9581546 ghz ) at high ( hr , @xmath1 ghz ) and low ( lr , @xmath2 ghz ) spectral resolution .",
    "the spire fts flux calibration is a two stage process ( see @xcite for more details ) : firstly , the telescope is used to derive the extended source calibration , which converts the interferogram signal timeline from volts to w m@xmath3",
    "hz@xmath4 sr@xmath4 and provides level-1 spectra .",
    "secondly , extended data is converted to flux density units of jy ( @xmath5 w m@xmath3 hz@xmath4 ) to provide point source calibrated ( level-2 ) spectra .",
    "fts uses uranus as the primary point source calibrator .",
    "the fts flux calibration is split into two epochs , due to a change in the position of the internal beam - steering mirror ( bsm ) at the start of the _ herschel _ operational day ( od ) ` 1011 ` ( 19 feb 2012 , see @xcite ) .",
    "the change effectively moved the centre of the fts beam closer to the telescope optical axis .",
    "the earlier bsm position was at @xmath6 with respect to the telescope commanded sky position .",
    "therefore the currently implemented point - source flux calibration uses two sets of uranus observations : `` before '' and `` after '' .",
    "it is important to know the pointing offset for the primary calibrator .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ knowledge of the actual pointing of the _ herschel _ telescope for staring observations with the fts , i.e. in sparse mode .",
    "we know the commanded pointing error ( or the absolute pointing error , ape ) of _ herschel _ is @xmath7 at 68% confidence level throughout the _ herschel _ mission , with significant improvement for observations after 11 mar 2013 ( or _ herschel _ s operational day ) , down to ape @xmath8 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the uncertainty in the pointing can lead to significant differences in the derived flux calibration , if a perfectly centred source is assumed .",
    "an additional source of pointing uncertainty is the stability of the pointing ( or the relative pointing error rpe ) once the telescope is commanded to the target position .",
    "the rpe is estimated at @xmath9 for moving targets ( i.e. solar system objects , sso ) and smaller for non - moving ones @xcite .",
    "this is insignificant compared to the smallest spire fts beam ( @xmath10 at 1500 ghz , see later ) and for the rest of the analysis we consider the pointing to be perfectly stable .",
    "nevertheless , we include the rpe in the error budget for the results .",
    "we have determined the pointing offsets for all uranus observations , including those currently used for the point - source calibration .",
    "hence the presented work has important consequences for the flux calibration scheme as well as for future improvements by combining more than one observation of the primary calibrator .    adding more calibration targets with repeated observations",
    "is a consistency check for the method itself and for the derived point source flux calibration scheme , especially for targets with relatively well known and accurate models .",
    "for example , without knowing the neptune pointing we can not conclude if the flux calibration scheme is good , because any pointing offset of neptune will lead to a difference of the observed versus the model flux of neptune , which will not be related to the accuracy of the flux calibration scheme .",
    "the structure of this paper is the following : in the next section (   [ sec : method ] ) we present the method , using two types of synthetic source models  a dirac @xmath11-function or a disk with a given radius and we derive a grid of the expected flux losses for a source at a range of distances from the centre of the fts gaussian beam . then in   [",
    "sec : results ] we present the results on the relative pointing offsets for uranus , neptune , ceres and ngc7027 , concentrating mostly on uranus as the primary calibrator for the spire spectrometer .",
    "we end the paper in ",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] with our conclusions and some insights on possible further improvements in the flux calibration scheme .",
    "the method uses level-1 data of repeated fts observations of calibration targets , performed in high ( hr ) or low ( lr ) spectral resolution . all level-1 data were reprocessed with the latest user reprocessing script in the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe , @xcite ) version 11 and spire calibration tree version spire_cal_11_0 . to avoid any dependence on uranus",
    ", we use level-1 data , because level-2 spectra are calibrated using a particular uranus observation .",
    "in addition , we consider only an overall continuum shift and ignore any change in the spectral slope or other non - linear effects .",
    "the analysis is performed solely using the fts short wavelength array central detector , sswd4 .",
    "a simple gaussian for the beam provides a good approximation over the frequencies of interest , 9001500 ghz ( see @xcite for more details ) where the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is of the order of 17@xmath12 .",
    "a smaller beam , however , means any pointing offset leads to more significant flux loss .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ loss ] for a perfect point source ( a @xmath11-function ) placed at different offsets from the fts beam centre . and",
    "indeed , the flux loss for slw even at the extreme @xmath13 offset is 15 - 25% , while it is 50 - 60% in ssw .",
    "-function ) placed at different offsets from the fts beam centre .",
    "these curves were derived assuming a gaussian spire fts beam response at each frequency .",
    "this is a good approximation for ssw ( 9001500 ghz ) @xcite.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    as seen by _ herschel _ , uranus , neptune and ceres are variable sources due to their distance from the sun , their rotation and the telescope position on its orbit around the second lagrange point l2 . the changes in the brightness due to the variability will have the same effect as a pointing offset , i.e. overall continuum shift .",
    "this complicates the analysis because we need to know the predicted planet flux for the exact time of the observation .",
    "the planetary models used in this analysis are esa-4 for uranus ( based on the updated model of @xcite ) and esa-3 for neptune ( based on the updated model of @xcite ) .",
    "the absolute systematic flux calibration uncertainties in these models , derived by comparing uranus and neptune , are of the order of 3% @xcite . for ceres",
    "we use the models by @xcite , which are more uncertain , at @xmath14% , because of the systematic phase variance due to the use of shorter wavelength data from iso .    to derive the flux loss",
    "we assume the fts has a gaussian beam @xmath15 with fwhm @xmath16 at a given frequency @xmath17 .",
    "we calculate the flux loss for two cases of a source shape : ( 1 ) a perfect point source represented by a dirac @xmath11-function and ( 2 ) a disk with radius @xmath18 , which in the 1d case is a tophat function :    @xmath19    in both cases , the source is moved on a grid of pointing offsets @xmath20 from 0 to a maximum @xmath13 with respect to centre of the gaussian beam and then it is convolved with the beam .",
    "that is    @xmath21    for @xmath22 source , and    @xmath23 ,   \\label{eq_tophat}\\ ] ]    for a uniform disk of radius @xmath18 , where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a normalisation constant and @xmath26 is the error function . for a uniform disk centred in the beam , i.e. @xmath27 , then @xmath28 is the beam correction factor @xmath29 as used in the flux calibration scheme @xcite .",
    "the flux loss at a given frequency is then @xmath30 where @xmath31 comes either from eq .",
    "[ eq_delta ] or eq .",
    "[ eq_tophat ] .",
    "the results are shown in fig .  [ fig_losses ] . in the case of uranus , with a typical size of @xmath32 , the tophat and",
    "the @xmath11-function results are different by less than 1% , even for an extreme pointing offset of @xmath13 . for neptune , which has an angular radius smaller than uranus  typically around @xmath33  this difference is negligible .",
    "let us assume a reference observation < ref > with the source exactly in the centre of the beam .",
    "if the source has constant brightness then @xmath34 will be a measure of the flux loss at frequency @xmath17 , and the loss can be considered as only due to the pointing offset of < obs > with respect to < ref>. a source with constant brightness included in this study is ngc  7027 but for the solar system objects uranus , neptune and ceres , the brightness depends on when they were observed , which means the direct ratio @xmath35 has to be corrected for the predicted flux from the planet , i.e. @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the ratio of the modelled fluxes at the two epochs of < ref > and < obs>. note that the model ratio @xmath38 is independent of the frequency , i.e. the models for observations at different epochs only differ by an overall continuum shift , independent of the frequency .",
    "the choice of the reference observation is iterative .",
    "all @xmath35 ratios are constructed taking an arbitrary < ref > observation and then we pick the one that has the lowest @xmath35 , below or at zero . indeed ,",
    "if the selected reference observation is the one where the target is closest to the centre of the beam then there will be no @xmath39 smaller than zero , within the margin of the model uncertainties .",
    "an hr observation is always selected as reference . in order to avoid large fluctuations in the ratios @xmath35 we smooth it with a 20ghz boxcar function , after performing the division . for lr observations we interpolate the smoothed reference hr spectra to the same frequency grid as the lr observation , before deriving the ratio .",
    "this avoids huge fluctuations , especially in the case of neptune , where there are emission and absorption lines present in the spectra .",
    "[ fig_robs ] shows the @xmath35 for all targets included in this study .",
    "the _ relative pointing offset _",
    "@xmath20  is derived by comparing @xmath35 with the grid of simulated offsets @xmath40 ( i.e. fig .",
    "[ fig_losses ] )",
    ". if the flux loss is only due to pointing then the derived pointing offset @xmath20 should be constant with frequency .",
    "the results for a few observations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_examples ] .",
    "we calculate the median offset and the median absolute deviation ( as a robust measure of the spread ) considering frequencies from 1100 to 1400 ghz , in order to avoid large fluctuations near the band edges .",
    "as the method is relative , the uncertainties coming from the models ( for ssos ) cancel out and the only factors entering the error budget are the pointing stability ( the rpe ) of @xmath9 ( assumed perfect for the method ) and the uncertainty of 1% on @xmath35 coming from the statistical repeatability of the observations @xcite . in most cases",
    "the rpe is the dominant uncertainty in the derived offsets .",
    "the above method was applied to all observations of uranus , neptune , ceres and ngc  7027 and the results are shown in fig .  [ fig_results ] and",
    "tabulated in tabs .",
    "[ tab_uranus][tab_ngc7027 ] . for uranus and neptune ,",
    "we also include low resolution observations .",
    "note that for neptune , ceres and ngc  7027 we used a @xmath11-function for the source shape .                [ cols=\">,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      ceres is another sso included in the analysis , with 7 observations all in hr mode , for which the results are show in tab .",
    "[ tab_ceres ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig_results ] , bottom left .",
    "the results can be used to improve the current ceres models .",
    "there are other asteroids with repeated fts observations and this method can be applied to correct for pointing effects in their scientific analysis ( lim et al , in preparation ) .",
    "the results for ngc7027 are shown in tab .",
    "[ tab_ngc7027 ] and in fig .",
    "[ fig_results ] , bottom right .",
    "the case of ngc7027 is sightly complicated because the source has many emission lines and in order to apply the reference ratio method we need to extract the continuum .",
    "we did this by simultaneously fitting the brightest lines and the continuum in the level-2 spectrum .",
    "the fitted continuum  a polynomial of a second order  is then used to calculate @xmath39 .",
    "we note that the use of a second order polynomial is potentially a poor fit at frequencies above 1400 ghz and below 1100 ghz ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_examples ] ) , but as we limit the median estimation within [ 1110,1400 ] ghz then the effects do not bias the results .",
    "there was only one peculiar case ( in italic in tab .",
    "[ tab_ngc7027 ] ) where we had to explicitly mask the spectra near the band edges , before performing the polynomial fit . without this masking",
    "the fit was poor and the polynomial fit was significantly overestimating the continuum .    in _ herschel _ suffered a general telescope mispointing , due to the use of a wrong siam .",
    "the only observation we have in this od is for ngc7027 ( ) and the derived pointing offset of @xmath41 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the known offset of the siam on ( @xmath42 ) , giving another good consistency check of the method .      to illustrate how the results of this study can be used to correct spectra for pointing offsets , and consequently to improve the fts calibration , we selected one uranus observation , from  one of the most deviating ones , with a derived pointing offset of 4.2@xmath43 .",
    "[ fig_out ] shows the original spectra from the central detectors sswc3 and sswd4 ( in blue ) and the corrected spectra , assuming a pointing offset of 4.2@xmath43(in red ) .",
    "while the correction for the slw spectrum is less than 5% , we see a dramatic change in the continuum level of ssw , which improves significantly the spectral shape and the stitching of the two fts bands .",
    "the corrected spectrum is also much closer to the model prediction ( shown in green ) , which gives a good consistency check for the method .",
    "this example shows the potential of the method for improvements of the spectra of calibration targets and the overall calibration .    the illustration shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_out ] gives an interesting idea that , even in the case of not knowing the pointing of a given observation of a _ point - source _ , the difference between ssw and slw in the overlap region could be used as a crude guess on the pointing offset .",
    "of course this can only be done for point sources with high signal - to - noise , because this overlap region is the noisiest part of the fts spectra .",
    "nevertheless , this simple alternative way of correcting the effect of pointing is worth considering as it could be applied to science observations which do not have a well pointed reference observation for comparison .    ,",
    "are shown in red .",
    "the uranus predicted spectrum for the time of the observation is shown in green.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the method presented in this paper provides means to derive the relative pointing offsets for fts data , with respect to a reference observation .",
    "it is important to note that with this method we can not retrieve the actual pointing , but only the offset relative to a selected observation .",
    "the greater the number of observations of a particular calibration target the higher the chances there will be an observation or observations in which the target will be well centred in the beam .",
    "our conclusions are mainly focused on the results for uranus , as this planet is used as the primary fts calibrator .",
    "the results on the other calibration targets are also valuable and can be used in a number of studies that may improve our understanding of the accuracy and the repeatability of the line and continuum measurements .",
    "the derived relative pointing offsets for uranus unequivocally indicate that during from , our reference observation , the planet was very close to the centre of the ssw beam .",
    "this was also confirmed by the low resolution spectral map of uranus taken directly after the sparse observation , with inferred position of @xmath44 of uranus with respect to the expected position .",
    "this is the uncertainty in the transition from relative to absolute pointing offsets for uranus .",
    "in addition , we presented a number of consistency checks in support of the method and we are confident that the reported pointing offsets are correct , within the uncertainties introduced by the telescope jitter and the planets models .",
    "although from is better centred in the beam and no pointing correction is needed , it is significantly shallower , with only 4 repetitions , in comparison with the current observations used for the hr mode point - source calibration : from and from , both with 22 repetitions . hence , it is not advisable to use it for the point source conversion because of the lower signal to noise in the uranus spectrum .",
    "we confirm the pointing offsets of the deep uranus observations from used in the current flux calibration scheme .",
    "we note that the flux calibration used up to hipe v10 , for all observations , was based on the deep observation from .",
    "our results clearly indicated that uranus was very close to the beam centre , at a sub - arcsec offset , during this observation .",
    "this means the current fts point - source flux calibration , used for observations taken before the bsm change ( or for all observation before hipe v10 ) , is of a similar accuracy to the calibration now adopted for observations after the bsm change , which uses an observation corrected for pointing .",
    "the results we provide for uranus observations on a number of off - axis detectors indicate up to 6 - 7@xmath43pointing offsets .",
    "these were not taken into account in the current ( spire_cal_11_0 ) flux calibration , which means that there is a large overestimation of the conversion factors .",
    "therefore , the interpretation of point - source calibrated data from the off - axis detectors or from spectral maps must be carefully reconsidered for a possible flux loss .",
    "the results from this study will be incorporated in the next update of the fts calibration .",
    "having the correct pointing offsets makes it possible to combine all available observations of a given calibration target , because we can effectively correct each one for the pointing .",
    "this procedure will decrease the overall noise in the spectrum , however , one has to be careful because the systematic noise properties of observations at different off - axis positions will be different .",
    "nevertheless we envisage to apply this idea to the upcoming calibration of the fts and evaluate the pros and cons with respect to the current calibration scheme .",
    "the improvements in the fts calibration , incorporating the results from this study , are part of the on - going work of the fts team .",
