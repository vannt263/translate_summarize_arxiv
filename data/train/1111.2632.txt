    "the strmgren @xmath0 system @xcite , is a widely used intermediate - band photometric system comprising data for more than 63,300 stars in the homogenised @xcite catalog .",

    "however , the use of different filters at many observatories and the extension of the photometry to late - g and k stars and to supergiants and reddened stars has resulted in significant systematic differences in the instrumental systems between observers .",
    "the recommended method of photometric data reduction to derive the indices @xmath8 and @xmath9 , rather than the colors @xmath4 , @xmath5 directly , has also resulted in larger uncertainties in the transformed indices , mainly for the cooler stars .",
    "these problems have been vividly illustrated and discussed by @xcite .",
    "a large database of excellent @xmath0 photometry has been obtained with the four 4-channel spectrograph - photometers @xcite on telescopes at kitt peak , la silla and san pedro martir ( eg . * ? ? ?",

    "fig 1 in @xcite shows the complicated decision processes carried out to transform this well defined and stable natural system photometry onto the standard system .",
    "@xcite also discussed the non - linearities involved in successively transforming his e - region photometry onto the standard system and @xcite outlined issues associated with too - narrow a @xmath10 filter . given these different and complex transformations one may wonder whether passbands can be defined that accurately represent the homogenised @xmath0 system .    in the last few years , two libraries of accurate higher resolution (",
    "r@xmath111000 - 2000 ) spectrophotometric data have become available - ngsl ( * ? ? ?",
    "* http://archive.stsci.edu/prepds/stisngsl/index.html ) and miles ( * ? ?",
    "* http://www.iac.es/proyecto/miles/ ) and most of the stars in these spectral libraries also have hipparcos @xmath12 magnitudes - enabling @xcite to renormalize the spectrophotometry on to a precise absolute scale by synthesizing the @xmath12 magnitudes",
    ". many of these stars are also in the @xcite @xmath0 catalog thus providing the opportunity to critically compare the synthetic @xmath0 photometry with the standard values .",
    "@xcite and @xcite published transmissions of the kpno @xmath0 filter set no.1 that was used when setting up the original @xmath0 system by @xcite .",
    "these filter functions are considered to be the best starting point for synthetic @xmath0 photometry calculations .",
    "synthetic photometry based on model atmosphere fluxes have been computed by many authors @xcite and while most have convolved the filter functions with a 1p21 sensitivity function , al mirror reflectivity and 1 airmass of extinction , some ( eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have used the filter transmissions directly .",
    "the product of the filter passband , the atmospheric transmission , the mirror reflectivity and the detector sensitivity function is called the system response function or system passband . in the past ,",
    "the detector sensitivity function that was used related to the energy measured . nowadays with photon counting detectors being the norm",
    ", the detector sensitivity function used relates to the number of photons measured .",
    "the resultant system response functions or system passbands therefore differ depending whether they reflect the energy of the photons or the number of photons . as modern synthetic photometry packages , such as @xmath13",
    "assume that system response functions are in the photon form , we will use that form in this paper and also use the terms photonic response function or photonic passband to distinguish them from the alternative energy forms .",
    "the 1p21 sensitivity function is from ( * ? ? ? * table 7 ) ; this has the same uv - cuton as measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table1.1 ) and appears to have a similar red cutoff to that measured by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fig 6 ) .",
    "it is presumed to be in terms of the photocathode radiant response ( in units of ma w@xmath14 ) and we have converted it into qe to derive the photonic responses ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the mirror reflectivity ( see values in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was neglected , but we applied 1.2 air masses of typical siding spring observatory ( 1200 m ) extinction .    in table 1",
    "we list our adopted normalized system photonic passbands @xmath15 for @xmath16 , @xmath10 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and in fig 1 we show the passbands compared to those of @xcite and the 4-channel spectrograph - photometers @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "the synthetic photometry was computed by evaluating , for each of the @xmath0 bands , the expression ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the observed absolute flux in erg @xmath22 sec@xmath14 hz@xmath14 , @xmath23 is the observed absolute flux in erg @xmath22 sec@xmath14 @xmath14 , @xmath24 , is the photonic passband ( table 1 ) , @xmath25 is the wavelength in  , and zp@xmath26 is the zeropoint magnitude for each band .    for accurate synthetic photometry it is important that the passbands provided to the integration routines are well sampled and smooth .",
    "it is necessary therefore , to interpolate the coarsely sampled values of the passbands in table 1 to a finer spacing of a few   using a univariate spline or a parabolic interpolation routine .",
    "firstly , the calspec stis005 spectrum for vega was used to derive the ab@xmath27 mag zeropoints of @xmath280.308 , @xmath280.327 , @xmath280.187 and @xmath280.027 for @xmath16 , @xmath10 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , adopting for vega , @xmath18=0.03 , @xcite ; @xmath29=0.004 , @xmath2=0.157 and @xmath3=1.088 , @xcite .",
    "we then computed synthetic colors for all the renormalized ngsl ( 376 ) and miles ( 830 ) spectra @xcite and matched the stars against the homogenised @xcite catalog , yielding 259 and 535 objects , respectively , with both spectrophotometry and @xmath0 photometry .",
    "the color differences and index differences were regressed against @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and little evidence of residuals that were a continuous function of color were found . any variation with color that was evident",
    "was better dealt with by splitting the sample into blue and red stars , rather than fitting an overall color term . those stars with @xmath30 0.5 also showed slightly more scatter than did the bluer stars which could have been anticipated since the @xmath0 system was initially standardized for the bluer stars and extended later to the redder stars using a greater range of instrumental systems and only a few red standards .",
    "( the higher scatter in the miles comparison for those measures involving the @xmath16 band in this paper should be discounted because we extrapolated their uv fluxes somewhat crudely using model atmosphere fits to the rest of the spectrum . )",
    "overall , it was extremely gratifying to see the near unity slopes and small scatter in the comparisons , indicating that the realised passbands are an excellent representation of the standard system .    figures 2 - 6 show the regressions for @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 overlayed with the lines fitted to the blue and red spectra separately .",
    "there were about 185 blue and 70 red spectra in the ngsl sample , and 360 blue and 150 red spectra in the miles sample .",
    "in many cases the same fitted line for blue and red stars could suffice within the uncertainties , but for some colors and indices , small blue / red star differences were evident .",
    "figure 7 shows the synthetic @xmath31 regressions against @xmath1 ; the @xmath32 passband is from @xcite .",
    "the mean wavelength of the @xmath18 band is clearly very close to that of the @xmath32 band .    in table 2",
    "are listed the results of the least - square linear fits to the regressions , including the uncertainties in the coefficients and the residual rms .",
    "it is recommended that the transformation equations determined from the space - based ngsl spectra be used to convert synthetic photometry onto the same system as the @xcite catalog ; however , the equations from the miles fits are in excellent agreement with those from the ngsl spectra , although the scatter is slightly higher . it should also be noted that the slopes of the transformations are of the same order as the observational values reported by @xcite using kpno filter set no 1 .",
    "@xcite was the first to use synthetic photometry to explore the systematic effects that different instrumental system passbands have on @xmath0 photometry .",
    "this was further discussed by @xcite .",
    "we decided to use the ngsl spectrophotometric data to examine two widely used natural @xmath0 systems , the 4-channel spectrograph - photometers @xcite and that of @xcite , in order to explore the systematic differences that could be expected between their instrumental systems and that presented in this paper as representing the standard system .",
    "the photonic passband of @xcite are plotted in fig 1 and listed in table 3 ( the narrow spike in the published helt et al .",
    "@xmath16 passband has been smoothed over ) . in fig 8 and 9",
    "we show the computed differences in the @xmath4 and @xmath5 colors plotted against @xmath1 for the ngsl spectra .",
    "the division between dwarfs and giants in these plots was made at log g @xmath33 ; higher gravity stars are plotted as dwarfs and lower gravity as giants .",
    "the total range of the vertical scales of the two plots in each figure is the same .",
    "the differences shown in the plots are very similar to those indicated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to see the dwarf - giant separation for the cooler stars and the increase in scatter for the cooler giants .",
    "the effect of the narrow @xmath10 band ( @xmath11110  fwhm ) reported by @xcite was also investigated .",
    "an eggen - type @xmath10 band was constructed by simply scaling the half - width of the standard band and keeping the same central wavelength . in fig 10",
    "are shown the computed difference in the measured @xmath10 magnitude plotted against @xmath1 and @xmath34 .",
    "large difference are seen for the hotter stars due to the strength of the h@xmath35 line and in the cool giants and dwarfs due mainly to the atomic and molecular features .    as pointed out by @xcite ,",
    "these comparisons underline the difficulties that observers with non - standard passbands experience in trying to standardize their internally precise @xmath0 photometry .",
    "we have derived passbands for the @xmath0 system using the kpno no.1 filter transmissions of @xcite and @xcite convolved with the cathode sensitivity function of a 1p21 photomultiplier tube , and an extinction of 1.2 airmasses .",
    "these were converted to photonic passbands by dividing by the wavelength and then renormalized .",
    "they are listed in table 1 and shown in figure 1 .",
    "initial ab mag @xmath0 zeropoints were derived from the stis005 spectrum of vega .",
    "synthetic photometry was then carried out on the extensive ngsl and miles spectrophotometric catalogs and compared with the observational data in the homogenised @xcite catalog .",
    "excellent linear fits with near unity slopes were made to the synthetic - observational regressions showing how well the passbands represent the standard system .",
    "the coefficents of the fitted lines are given in table 2 and the equations from the ngsl stars should be used to produce standard photometric values from synthetic photometry of observed spectrophotometric fluxes or model atmosphere fluxes .",
    "some non - standard passbands of two well defined natural @xmath0 systems were also synthesized and shown to produce similar systematic differences to those reported by the users .",
    "these effects limit the accuracy with which transformations to the standard system can be made , mainly for the cooler stars and the hotter reddened stars .",
    "the narrow @xmath10-band used by @xcite and others was shown to produce the largest systematic differences and supports eggen s decision to not standardize his m1 and c1 photometry .",
    "however , in spite of these limitations , observers have generally been successful in transforming their photometry onto the standard system and @xcite have been successful in producing a very useful homogenised @xmath0 catalog .",
    "hopefully , the revised passbands and transformation equations presented here will enable more reliable theoretical calibrations of strmgren indices to be made using model atmosphere fluxes .",
    "i wish to thank william schuster for very helpful correspondence concerning the history and operation of the 4-channel spectrograph - photometers and the referee chris sterken for many suggestions that improved the paper .",
