    "since a honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet with only nearest - neighbour ( nn ) interactions ( @xmath3 ) is considered as a bipartite lattice , the ground state exhibits long - range ordering .",
    "however , the system is rather fragile against the onset of frustrating interactions . in recent years , therefore , it has become of great interest to investigate the corresponding model where the nn bonds are augmented by frustrating next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) bonds with the strength @xmath4 , possibly also in conjunction with next - next - nearest - neighbour ( nnnn ) bonds of the strength @xmath0 .",
    "an interest in the honeycomb lattice is also promoted from the recent experimental activity @xcite and from graphen - related issues @xcite . due to these reasons , recently there has been a huge theoretical interest in frustrated spin models on the honeycomb lattice , in which frustration is incorporated by nnn interactions and maybe also nnnn interactions @xcite . in this paper",
    "we utilize the effective - field theory with correlations ( eft ) as in our earlier work for the simpler @xmath5 model @xcite .",
    "therefore , it will be interesting to study effects of frustration on the phase diagram of this bipartite lattice without making the restriction @xmath6 .",
    "we consider the frustrated honeycomb ising antiferromagnet ( af ) with nn @xmath7 , nnn @xmath8 , and nnnn @xmath9 interactions .",
    "then the hamiltonian for the resulting spin-@xmath1 @xmath2 ising af on the honeycomb lattice is given by @xmath10 where index @xmath11 runs over all honeycomb lattice sites , and indices @xmath12 , and @xmath13 run over all nn , nnn , and nnnn sites to @xmath14 respectively , counting each bond once and once only , and @xmath15 .",
    "the lattice and interactions are illustrated in fig .",
    "1 .     ising model on the honeycomb lattice , showing in ( a ) the nel state , where two sublattices are marked by black and white circles .",
    "the anti - nel states are shown in ( b ) and ( c ) ( see text ) . ]",
    "we discuss first the ground state of this model .",
    "the af phases consist of the nel phase ( n ) ( fig .",
    "1(a ) ) and two anti - nel phases ( an ) described either by alternate single ferromagnetic columns of antiparallel spins or alternate pairs of columns consisting of af coupled spins shown in fig .",
    "1(b ) and fig .",
    "1(c ) ( see also fig .",
    "17 of @xcite ) .",
    "the ground - state energy per site for the af nel phase is @xmath16 in this case each site has its three nn bonds on the other sublattice , six nnn on its own sublattice , and three nnnn on the other sublattice .",
    "thus only the nnn interactions act to frustrate the antiferromagnetism . on the other hand ,",
    "the an ground state for @xmath17 is twofold degenerate and two states , labeled ( b ) and ( c ) in fig . 1",
    ", have exactly the same ground - state energy .",
    "however , adding the nnnn af interactions ( or @xmath0 ) , only the ( c ) state has lower energy given by @xmath18 now , pairwise equating the ground - state energies of the different af phases , one can find that the first - order transition between the n and an phases is determined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the frustration parameter and @xmath21 . on the other hand ,",
    "we have found by using monte carlo simulations that the ground state of the an phase is degenerate and has the energy @xmath22 therefore , the ground - state energy per site in this case is less than that given by relation ( [ an ] ) . comparing this ground - state energy of the an phase with ( [ af ] )",
    ", we obtain that the n and an phases have the same energy only on the line given by eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "let us consider the eft ( for a review see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) based on a single - site cluster containing only one spin on a site @xmath11 and a sublattice @xmath24 which interacts with other nn , nnn , and nnnn spins from the neighbourhood . in this approach , applying the differential operator technique , and using the van der waerden identity for the two - state ising spin system , one finds for the af cluster on the honeycomb lattice the exact relation @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes a thermal average , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are spin variables on sublattices @xmath24 and @xmath29 , respectively , @xmath30 , @xmath31 @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the differential operator , and @xmath34 .",
    "now , assuming the statistical independence of lattice sites , eq .",
    "( [ exactmaga ] ) reduces to @xmath35 where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) are the sublattice magnetizations per site .",
    "it should be noted here that this approximation is quite superior to the standard mean - field theory since even though it neglects correlations between different spins but takes the single - site kinematic relations exactly into account through the van der waerden identity . on the other hand",
    ", the standard mean - field theory neglects all correlations .    at this place , in order to solve the problem generally , we need to evaluate the sublattice magnetization @xmath38 . it can be derived in the same way as @xmath39 by the use of the selected spin @xmath40 on the @xmath29 sublattice .",
    "however , at zero magnetic field we have @xmath41 and the equation for @xmath38 is the same as eq .",
    "( [ mag_a ] ) .",
    "therefore , in what follows we use only eq . ( [ mag_a ] ) , which in this case takes the final form @xmath42 the coefficients @xmath43 , which depend on @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , can be easily calculated within the symbolic programming by using the mathematical relation @xmath46 .    in order to determine the phase diagram of the af @xmath2 model , we should solve eq .",
    "( [ mag_s ] ) for a given value of the frustration parameter @xmath47 and the interaction @xmath45 , and look for the temperature at which the magnetization ( order parameter ) @xmath48 goes to zero .",
    "however , for some values of @xmath47 and @xmath45 , the order parameter goes to zero discontinuously , i.  e. , the transition becomes first order . to analyze first - order transitions , one needs to calculate the free energy for the n and paramagnetic ( p ) phases and to find a point of intersection . because the expression for the free energy in this effective - field theory does not exist , it will be extrapolated with the help of the relation for the equilibrium value of the order parameter ( [ mag_s ] ) as follows @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the free energy of the disordered ( paramagnetic ) phase and @xmath51 is the order parameter which takes the value @xmath48 at thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "we note that relation ( [ freeenergy ] ) corresponds to a landau free energy expansion in the order parameter truncated at the @xmath52 term .",
    "then a critical temperature and a tricritical point , at which the phase transition changes from second order to first order , are determined by the following conditions @xcite : ( i ) the second - order transition line when @xmath53 and @xmath54 and ( ii ) the tricritical point ( tcp ) when @xmath55 , @xmath56 if @xmath57 .",
    "however , the first - order phase transition line is evaluated by solving simultaneously two transcendental equations , namely the equilibrium condition @xmath58_{m = m_s } = 0 $ ] and the equation @xmath59 that corresponds to the point of intersection of the free energies for the n and p phases .",
    "now , by using the general formulation given in the previous section , let us examine the phase diagram of the system .     plane for the @xmath2 model , when the interaction @xmath60 is changed .",
    "solid and dashed lines indicate second- and first - order transitions , respectively , while the black circles denote the position of a tcp .",
    "n and p are the nel and paramagnetic phases , respectively.,height=188 ]    in fig .",
    "2 , the critical temperature @xmath61 versus @xmath47 is shown for selected values of @xmath60 .",
    "the solid lines indicate the second - order phase transitions , while the dashed lines represent the first - order phase transitions .",
    "the black circles denote the position of tcps at which the phase transitions change from second to first order . the most important feature in fig .",
    "2 is that the @xmath5 model on the honeycomb lattice exhibits only the second - order phase transition which vanishes at @xmath62 , in agreement with the ground state discussed above .",
    "however , if the @xmath45 interaction is different from zero and gradually decreases from zero to a larger negative value , the tricritical point appears in the system for @xmath63 ( see , e.g. the curve labeled by -0.24 ) .",
    "it is also noteworthy that all transition temperatures @xmath64 between the n and p phases as function of the frustration parameter @xmath47 approach zero at the values of @xmath47 determined by eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "this indicates that the ground - state energy of the an phase for the @xmath2 ising model on the honeycomb lattice is indeed given by eq .",
    "( [ anmc ] ) .     for the @xmath2 ising model with @xmath65 , when the frustration parameter @xmath47 is changed .",
    "the dashed lines indicate the first - order transitions.,height=188 ]    in order to confirm the prediction of the first- and second - order phase transitions , let us examine temperature dependencies of the order parameter @xmath48 for the system with @xmath66 , when the value of @xmath47 is changed . as can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , the order parameter @xmath48 falls smoothly to zero when temperature increases from zero to @xmath61 , characterizing a second - order phase transition .",
    "similarly , @xmath48 also reduces to zero continuously at the tcp ( see curve labeled @xmath67 ) . on the other hand , below the tcp",
    ", the stable solution of @xmath48 becomes discontinuous at the first - order phase transition and this discontinuity increases with @xmath47 going to @xmath68 .",
    "the curves for @xmath69 and @xmath70 are examples of such behavior , where the first - order transition is indicated by a vertical dashed line .",
    "we have studied the phase diagram in the @xmath71 plane of the frustrated @xmath2 ising model with spin-@xmath1 on a honeycomb lattice using the eft based on the single - spin cluster .",
    "we have determined that in the ground - state two ordered phases , namely the n and an states coexist only on the line given by eq .",
    "( [ trans ] ) with @xmath23 .",
    "however , for the an phase we have not found a long - range order at @xmath72 k due to the degeneracy of the ground state .",
    "this behaviour has been also confirmed by our preliminary monte carlo calculations . on the other hand ,",
    "the present eft predicts the tcp in the phase diagram between the n and p phases due to the @xmath45 interaction .",
    "of course , this is the effective - field result , therefore , further monte carlo simulations or more reliable calculations for this frustrated @xmath2 ising model would be desirable .",
