    "our title , _ what are butcher series , really ? _ , is a question about the algebraic and geometric structure of rooted trees and elementary differentials . the story of butcher series and its uses in chemistry , theoretical physics , and applied and pure mathematics is fascinating .",
    "we shall relate this story to recent attempts to answer our title question .",
    "we begin , however , with the traditional definition .",
    "butcher series are intimately associated with the set of smooth ( infinitely differentiable ) vector fields on vector spaces .",
    "indeed , let @xmath0 be a smooth vector field on a vector space @xmath1 , defining the ordinary differential equation ( ode ) @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the derivative with respect to time  @xmath4 .",
    "one way to study ( [ eq : ode ] ) is to develop the taylor series of its solutions .",
    "let @xmath5 be the solution to ( [ eq : ode ] ) at time @xmath6 subject to the initial condition @xmath7 .",
    "the taylor series of @xmath5 in @xmath8 is @xmath9 we already know that @xmath7 and @xmath10 .",
    "the additional terms can be found by repeatedly applying the chain and product rule .",
    "for example , @xmath11 or , relative to a basis @xmath12 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "continuing in this way gives @xmath15 here the @xmath16th derivative @xmath17 of the vector field @xmath0 is regarded as a multilinear map @xmath18 ; for example , @xmath19 is the vector field on @xmath1 whose @xmath20th coordinate is @xmath21 a vector field of the form appearing in  , combining @xmath0 and its derivatives , is called an _",
    "elementary differential_. now , using  , the taylor series   for the solution of ( [ eq : ode ] ) can be written as @xmath22 where each elementary differential is evaluated at  @xmath23 .",
    "notice that the power of @xmath8 in each term is determined by the multiplicity of @xmath0 in the elementary differential .",
    "however , the coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath26 , and so on are _ not _ determined by their corresponding elementary differentials .",
    "a _ butcher series _ , shortly denoted _ b - series _ , is a generalization of   allowing arbitrary coefficients , i.e. , a formal series of the form @xmath27 where  @xmath28 .",
    "although presented here in coordinates , we shall see that butcher series do not depend on the choice of basis .",
    "butcher series are named in honour of the new zealand mathematician john butcher . in a publication career spanning ( so far ) 60 years",
    "he has written 167 papers and books , all but 18 of them concerned in some way with runge  kutta methods and their generalisations .",
    "most of them involve in some way the fundamental structure that bears his name .",
    "butcher series were introduced in a remarkable series of ten sole - authored papers in the years 19631972 .",
    "a runge  kutta method is a numerical approximation @xmath29 of the exact flow of   defined by the following equations in @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 : @xmath33 here @xmath34 is the number of stages of the method and @xmath35 , @xmath36 are real numbers parameterising the runge  kutta method .",
    "associated with the abstract runge  kutta method ( [ eq : rk ] ) are its _ order conditions _ , polynomials equations in @xmath35 and @xmath36one equation per elementary differential  that determine the order of convergence of the method and its local error .",
    "their derivation has been simplified over the years ; a modern exposition can be found in hairer , lubich and wanner  @xcite .    the first breakthrough paper dates from 1963  @xcite . here",
    "butcher found for the first time the coefficients @xmath37 of the b - series ( [ eq : bseries ] ) of @xmath31 of the taylor expansion in @xmath8 of an arbitrary runge  kutta method .",
    "this gave the order conditions for runge  kutta methods in complete generality .",
    "as previous studies had laboriously expanded the solutions of particular ( e.g. , explicit ) methods by hand , this was an enormously important development .",
    "butcher did have , however , some precursors .",
    "the most notable example is the paper of merson  @xcite from 1957 .",
    "robert henry ` robin ' merson ( 19211992 ) was a scientist at the royal aircraft establishment , farnborough , uk , who was invited along with more senior numerical analysts to a conference on data processing and automatic computing machines at australia s weapons research establishment in salisbury , south australia .",
    "it seems like a long way to go for a conference in 1957 .",
    "however , the uk was still performing above - ground atomic bomb tests in south australia at that time and the australian government was very keen to be a part of the emerging era .",
    "merson s work is bound up with one of the most significant events of 1957 , the launch of sputnik 1 on 4 october 1957 , and the tale of farnborough s involvement is told in detail by one of the key participants , desmond king - hele , in his book _ a tapestry of orbits _  @xcite .",
    "the short version is that with the aid of a large radio antenna hastily erected in a nearby field , and some calculations of robin merson , within two weeks they had an accurate orbit for sputnik 1 .",
    "this allowed them to estimate the density of the upper atmosphere and ( after sputnik 2 ) the shape of the earth .",
    "robin merson became an expert in practical numerical analysis and orbit determination .",
    "merson s paper explains clearly the structure of the elementary differentials @xmath38 , @xmath19 and so on , and , crucially , shows how they are in one - to - one correspondence with rooted trees .",
    "he also introduces various basic operations on rooted trees .",
    "this development , perhaps regarded initially as a bookkeeping device for finding and keeping track of the different terms , has over time become central to the combinatorial and algebraic study of b - series .",
    "merson s  @xcite 1957 diagram of rooted trees representing elementary differentials , and ( bottom ) an example of a product of trees , in this case the pre - lie product explained in section  [ sec : alg ] . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] +   merson s  @xcite 1957 diagram of rooted trees representing elementary differentials , and ( bottom ) an example of a product of trees , in this case the pre - lie product explained in section  [ sec : alg ] . , title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]",
    "the existence of the aromatic series shows that affine - equivariance of a method is not enough to ensure that it can be expanded in a b - series .",
    "what else is needed ?",
    "the second big clue is that runge ",
    "kutta methods are defined without reference to the dimension of the underlying vector space .",
    "it does not seem to play any role at all . clearly , at a minimum , the expansion of the method in each dimension must have the same coefficients .",
    "but what rules out the aromatic terms like @xmath41 ?",
    "the answer is that these terms do not respect _ affine - relatedness_. consider two vector spaces @xmath1 and @xmath42 of possibly different dimension , together with an affine map @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "the vector fields @xmath0 on @xmath1 and @xmath45 on @xmath42 are said to be @xmath46-related if @xmath47 for for all @xmath48 .",
    "b - series preserve affine - relatedness in the sense that for any affine @xmath46 , if @xmath0 and @xmath45 are @xmath46-related then @xmath49 is @xmath46-related to @xmath50 . in",
    "@xcite we prove that this property characterizes b - series : _ a numerical method has a butcher series if and only if it preserves affine - relatedness .",
    "_    preserving affine - relatedness has a fairly direct physical interpretation .",
    "it means that the method is immune to changes of scale , such as changes of units .",
    "it means that the method preserves invariant affine subspaces _ automatically _",
    ", whenever the system has any such .",
    "it means that the method preserves affine symmetries , again automatically ; the method does not even have to ` know ' ( or be told ) that the system has the symmetries .",
    "it means that the method leaves decoupled systems decoupled , again automatically .",
    "all these properties are desirable when designing general - purpose ode software .",
    "so , to summarize , butcher series are objects intrinsically associated to the set of vector fields on vector ( properly , affine ) spaces of _ all _ dimensions , and will show up naturally in any analysis that does not depend on the dimension .",
    "this , to some extent , explains their ubiquity .    on the other hand , where does this leave the aromatic series ?",
    "we suggest that they will show up naturally in problems posed in a specific dimension .",
    "although traces are common in physics , we have not seen aromatic series before . they arose purely from a question in numerical analysis , but are fundamental in their own way .",
    "moreover , they can have properties that no b - series can have : many aromatic series , but no b - series , are divergence free .",

    "<S> butcher series appear when runge  kutta methods for ordinary differential equations are expanded in power series of the step size parameter . </S>",
    "<S> they provide an indispensable tool for determining the order of convergence of a method . each term in a butcher series consists of a weighted elementary differential , and the set of all such differentials is isomorphic to the set of rooted trees , as noted by cayley in the mid 19th century . </S>",

    "<S> the set of runge  kutta methods is dense in the butcher group , but it is now known that many other numerical methods also can be expanded in butcher series ; these are called b - series methods . a long - standing problem among numerical analysts has been to characterize , in terms of qualitative features , all b - series methods . </S>",
