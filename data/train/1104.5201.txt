    "afterglows allowed also the identification of lgrb host galaxies ( hgs ) , which turned out to be mostly low - mass , blue and subluminous galaxies with active star formation @xcite .",
    "although the general picture is clear enough , its details are still a matter of discussion . among other unanswered questions , the exact nature of the lgrb stellar progenitors is still being debated .",
    "stellar evolution models provide a rough picture of the production of a lgrb in a massive star . according to the _ collapsar _ model @xcite ,",
    "lgrbs are produced during the collapse of single wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars .",
    "wr stars have massive cores that may collapse into black holes , and are fast rotators , a condition needed to support an accretion disc and launch the collimated jets .",
    "wrs have also large mass - loss rates , needed to lose their hydrogen envelope before collapsing , that would otherwise brake the lgrb jet .",
    "this model agrees with the observed association between lgrbs and hydrogen deficient sne",
    ". however , wrs large mass - loss rates imply large angular momentum losses that would brake their cores , which would inhibit the production of the lgrb . to overcome this problem , @xcite proposed low - metallicity wrs ( wos ) as progenitors .",
    "wos have lower mass - loss rates , diminishing the braking effect , but also preventing the loss of the envelope .",
    "another possibility was proposed by @xcite . according to these authors , low - metallicity , rapidly rotating massive stars evolve in a chemically homogeneous way , hence burning the hydrogen envelope , instead of losing it .",
    "low - metallicity progenitor models are consistent with different pieces of evidence .",
    "first , the works of @xcite and @xcite show that the collapse of high - metallicity stars produces mainly neutron stars , while those of low - metallicity stars form black holes .",
    "second , lgrb hgs have been found to be low - metallicity systems @xcite .",
    "finally , the analysis of the statistical properties of the population of lgrbs suggests that their cosmic production rate should increase with respect to the cosmic star formation rate at high redshift , which could be explained as an effect of the low metallicity of the progenitors , combined with the cosmic metallicity evolution @xcite . another possibility for wr to lose",
    "the envelope without losing too much angular momentum is to be part of binary systems as proposed by @xcite .",
    "understanding the nature of lgrb progenitors is beyond the interest of only stellar evolution , black hole formation , and high energy astrophysics .",
    "the visibility of lgrbs up to very high redshifts ( @xmath5 ) , allows their use as tools to explore star formation and galaxy evolution in the early universe . on the other hand , observations of the environment and hgs of lgrbs",
    "could reveal important clues about the progenitors of these phenomena . given that star formation shifts outward within a galaxy due to the depletion of gas in the central regions",
    "as the galaxy evolves , that the interstellar medium of galaxies is not chemically homogeneous , and that the chemical enrichment is affected by variations of the star formation rate and the production of different types of sne , it is expected that both the lgrb positions within a galaxy and the chemical properties of the environment in which lgrbs occur depend on redshift and on the metallicity of the lgrb progenitors .    using high - precision astrometry , @xcite and @xcite",
    "have measured the positions of @xmath235 lgrbs with respect to the centres of their hosts , supporting the collapsar model against the ( now disproved ) neutron star merger model .",
    "the question of the metallicity dependence of lgrb progenitors could also be investigated comparing these data with model predictions .",
    "the chemical abundances of lgrb circumburst and hg environments were investigated by several authors @xcite .",
    "however , only in a few cases of low - redshift bursts a direct measure of the metallicity of the star - forming region that produced the lgrb is available . at intermediate redshift observers",
    "usually measure the mean hg metallicity , while at high redshift they must resort to grb - dla techniques , which give the metallicity of galactic clouds intercepting the line of sight to the lgrb , but not necessarily associated with the burst itself @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we use cosmological hydrodynamical simulations which include star formation and sn feedback to investigate the predictions of different progenitor scenarios regarding the positions of lgrbs and the chemical abundances of their environment . since galaxy formation is a highly non - linear process , cosmological numerical simulations @xcite are the best tools to investigate these lgrb properties . in the past",

    "both teams explored models with mass and metallicity cut - offs for lgrb progenitors , finding that models with a metallicity cut - off could explain the hg properties , and hence supporting previous claims that lgrbs are biased tracers of star formation . however in these semi - analytical models , the spatial distribution of individual stellar populations within hgs can not be investigated .",

    "@xcite found that the mass - metallicity relation ( mzr ) of galaxies in these simulations differs at low redshifts from that reported by @xcite so that galaxies have lower mean metallicity than observed although the shape of the observed mzr is very well reproduced . because of this , we renormalized the simulated abundances to make them consistent with observations .",

    "interestingly , the hosts of these lgrbs show evidence of interaction or close companions .",
    "hence , the presence of nuclear star formation activity could be explained as triggered by galaxy interactions as suggested by observations @xcite and numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "then , the discrepancy can be attributed to the fact that our simulated galaxy sample does not reflect the effects of this mode of star formation at low redshift since our analysed galaxies are dominated by systems with low gas reservoir @xcite . a further piece of evidence for this explanation is provided by a recalculation of the lowest-@xmath49 point , excluding the three quoted lgrbs ( filled circle in fig .",
    "[ bmedian ] ) .",
    "the new point lies within @xmath67 of our scenarios , showing a better agreement than the original one .",
    "the large error bars of the observations , which originate in the low number of lgrbs with precise positions , prevent us from using a goodness - of - fit estimator to determine the scenario that better fits the observations .",
    "however the fact that the observed values are always higher than the predictions of scenarios sc1 and sc2 implies that it is very improbable that these scenarios could explain the observations .",
    "hence our results suggest that lgrb progenitors would have low metallicities ( @xmath68 ) . in the case",

    "we observe that , for all our scenarios , they exibit a higher [ si / fe ] as redshift increases , indicating an enhacement in @xmath1 elements at high redshifts .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that snia and snii enrich the interstellar medium .",
    "due to the fact that snia progenitors have lifetimes @xmath69 while those of snii live only @xmath70 , at high redshift only the contribution of the latter to the interstelar medium enrichment is significant , rendering stellar populations rich in @xmath1 elements .",
    "as redshift decreases , the contribution of snia becomes important , decreasing the abundance of @xmath1 elements relative to iron .",

    "[ medians_sife_feh ] we show the median value of the ratio [ fe / h ] as a function of redshift .",
    "we find that the median value of [ fe / h ] decreases with @xmath44 as expected for cut - offs progressively more restrictive in metallicity .",
    "these results indicate that the metallicity cut - off tends to eliminate old stellar populations highly enriched by snii , located mainly in the central regions of galaxies and originated in first outbreaks of star formation .",

    "aiming at understanding the relation between lgrbs and star formation , we analysed the spatial distribution and chemical abundances of stellar populations producing these phenomena .",

    "particulary we best reproduce current available observations for a model where lgrb progenitors are massive stars with @xmath72 .",
    "further precise lgrb position measurements would help to confirm these trends .",
    "regarding [ fe / h ] abundances of the stellar populations producing lgrbs , we found that in all our scenarios [ fe / h ] increases as redshift decreases .",

    "contrary to the detected trend in [ fe / h ] , the @xmath1-enhancement shows a stronger evolution with redshift as @xmath44 decreases .",
    "as previously discussed , these chemical trends can be understood within the context of chemical evolution in hierarchical clustering scenarios .",
    "considering that the results on the spatial distribution of lgrb progenitors favours low - metallicity progenitor models , one would expect that the iron abundance of the stellar populations producing lgrbs remains low at all redshifts with little variations ( @xmath73}\\sim-1 $ ] ) .",
    "on the other hand , one would expect that the @xmath1-enhancement strongly decreases with redshift ( by 0.2  dex between @xmath71 and @xmath74 ) .",
    "this means that , if lgrbs are produced by low metallicity massive stars , their location will be shifted on average from the central regions to the outskirts of galaxies .",
    "if lgrbs can trace the chemical properties of the interestelar medium , they may map different regions of galaxies at different redshifts .",
