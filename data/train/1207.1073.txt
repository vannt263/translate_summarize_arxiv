    "in systems of reduced dimensionality , thermal and quantum fluctuations are the source of physical phenomena without analogues in ordinary 3d materials . since the original studies of mermin and wagner on the role of thermal fluctuations,@xcite it is known that in the isotropic spin-@xmath3 heisenberg model the divergent number of low - energy thermal excitations ( i.e.  spin waves ) suppresses any long - range ordered phase for dimensions @xmath4 . due to the reduced dimensionality ,",
    "the magnetic properties of spin arrays such as spin chains and ladders are further influenced by quantum effects that are masked in common 3d - materials . at @xmath5 , despite quantum corrections present in the antiferromagnetic case , magnetic order develops in the ground state of the 2d bipartite heisenberg model . due to the statistical analogy of a quantum @xmath6-dimensional antiferromagnet at zero temperature with a purely classical magnet at finite temperature in @xmath7 dimensions,@xcite quantum effects ,",
    "particularly effective in the antiferromagnetic case , imply the absence of long - range order in quantum heisenberg antiferromagnets for @xmath8 .    in real bulk materials ,",
    "however , the same concept of one - dimensionality is ill - defined .",
    "for instance , it has often been shown that the effective dimensionality of certain materials can strongly change upon variations of temperature,@xcite magnetic field,@xcite or energy scale@xcite being probed . as a consequence",
    ", the interpretation of the experimental observations requires an interpolation between limits of different effective degrees of freedom .",
    "this is particularly true for the specific case of spin- antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg chains realized in well - known model materials such as kcuf@xmath9,@xcite sr@xmath1cuo@xmath9,@xcite or copper pyrazine dinitrate.@xcite their high - temperature disordered phases , well described by the strictly one - dimensional luttinger liquid concept@xcite are , at low temperatures , replaced by a magnetically ordered state induced by weak interchain interactions .",
    "the need to interpolate between different dimensionalities suggested the introduction of the class of so - called _ quasi_-1d materials .",
    "the degree of one - dimensionality is usually measured in terms of the ratio between the nel temperature , marking the onset of the 3d magnetic order , and the intrachain exchange interaction.@xcite values of this ratio much below one signify the preservation of the 1d character of the system .",
    "nevertheless , 1d quantum fluctuations continue to be effective in the 3d domain too , i.e. , below the nel temperature .",
    "this is evident from both the strongly reduced saturation moment in the ordered state as well as from the deviations with respect to excitations predicted by the standard spin - wave theory.@xcite observations of the evolution of the properties of a physical system across the phase diagram , in regions characterized by different effective dimensionalities , has motivated a number of theoretical and experimental studies , dedicated to the phenomenon of dimensional crossover .",
    "the physics of an assembly of isolated spin- quantum chains upon increasing the interchain couplings is rather well understood.@xcite the impact of such a perturbation on chains experiencing a local transverse staggered field ( ltsf ) , however , is still an open question.@xcite a spin- quantum chain in a uniform field and a concomitant ltsf is usually modeled by the hamiltonian:@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the site - index along the chain direction , @xmath12 is the intrachain exchange coupling constant , @xmath13 is the bohr magneton , @xmath14 is the electronic gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the directions parallel and perpendicular to the externally applied field @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "the locally induced transverse staggered field is @xmath18 , with @xmath19 as a constant .",
    "the interest in spin chains with an ltsf was first triggered by experimental studies on copper benzoate cu(c@xmath20h@xmath21coo)@xmath1@xmath223h@xmath1o,@xcite probing the compound s magnetism via susceptibility , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and electron - spin resonance ( esr ) measurements . in zero magnetic field",

    ", the field - dependent bulk properties were soon found to be incompatible with corresponding theoretical results.@xcite incommensurate soft modes at field - dependent reciprocal space positions of the excitation spectrum are expected for spin- antiferromagnets in an applied field . the first inelastic neutron scattering ( ins )",
    "experiment , intended to verify these theoretical predictions , was performed on copper benzoate .",
    "@xcite field - driven incommensurate modes were indeed found at the expected positions in reciprocal space . due to an unexpected field- and orientation - dependent spin - gap @xmath26 , scaling as @xmath27 , these modes",
    "were not soft , however.@xcite this surprising ins observation was soon interpreted as the result of the particular character of the @xmath14-tensors and dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interactions . along the chain direction ,",
    "the non - diagonal tensor components change sign from one cu site to the next and the same is true for the dm @xmath28-vector . both can be mapped onto an effective ltsf and thus to eq .  .",
    "formally it turns out that , in the absence of interchain perturbative terms , the effective low - energy theory of the ltsf hamiltonian is given by the quantum sine - gordon ( sg ) model.@xcite the sg model is one of the few non - linear problems which benefits from an exact solution .",
    "hence , the low - energy theory provides analytical expressions for the physical quantities in the temperature range @xmath29 when @xmath30 .",
    "+ in the last 15 years the magnetic properties of a large number of both organic and inorganic compounds have successfully been described by the ltsf model . specifically , nmr and esr studies focused mostly on the joint detection of the temperature - dependent longitudinal ( @xmath31 ) and transverse ( @xmath32 ) local magnetization .",
    "examples are the cases of copper pyrimidine dinitrate @xcite and of bacu@xmath1ge@xmath1o@xmath2 @xcite .    quite generally , any real material ,",

    "we demonstrate how the local magnetization in a chain , adequately modeled by eq .  , develops above @xmath37 and how it evolves when @xmath38 .",

    "the reader is referred to table 1 in ref .  .",
    "over the years , studies of bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2  proceeded along two main directions , both related to the present work : _ i _ ) the study of the spin - reorientation transitions @xcite and , _ ii _ ) the investigation of the 1d - to-3d crossover.@xcite    regarding the first topic , experiments employing neutron scattering,@xcite esr,@xcite and ultrasound techniques,@xcite were carried out in externally applied magnetic fields of varying strengths and orientations .",
    "these studies provided evidence of a number of phase transitions related to the realignment of spins ( and spin - flop transitions for an externally applied field @xmath48 ) at @xmath34.@xcite in spite of serious efforts , the cause for these transitions is not yet clear.@xcite in the following we show that nmr data provide direct evidence of the presence of an enhanced transverse susceptibility below @xmath37 , offering a simple explanation for the observed spin reorientations .",
    "we suggest that non - trivial phase diagrams below the magnetic ordering temperature may appear naturally in anisotropic quasi-1d antiferromagnets exhibiting a strong reduction of the ordered moment .    as for the second topic",
    ", early studies have shown that bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2  is also a model spin - chain compound for investigating the crossover from quantum - spin 1d dynamics to semi - classical 3d ( spin - wave ) dynamics.@xcite zero - field ins experiments probing the range below the nel temperature revealed how the presence of weak interchain interactions @xmath49 , produce an effective ltsf originating from neighboring chains , which leads to a confinement of massless spinon excitations at @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the situation is not equivalent to that of non interacting 1d chains in a staggered field .",
    "the additional @xmath50 interactions induce dispersive excitations with a momentum transverse to the chain direction .",
    "their energy vanishes at well defined positions in reciprocal space , coinciding with the bragg peaks of the ordered structure . for bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2  in an applied magnetic field , intrinsic anisotropies lead to a field - induced ltsf causing a spin - gap to be present already above @xmath37 .",
    "the possibility of directly measuring the field - induced gap via ins is slim , but important consequences are expected for the local static magnetization . since the latter is accessible via nmr , we took advantage of this unique opportunity to study the 1d - to-3d crossover in a quantum - spin chain with an ltsf modeled by eq .  .",
    "the nmr measurements were carried out on a @xmath51 mm@xmath52 single crystal of bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "since the @xmath53 and @xmath19 lattice parameters are roughly the same , the correct identification of the two crystallographic directions is not trivial .",
    "field - dependent magnetization measurements on the same sample with @xmath48 could detect the two expected spin - flop transitions , hence confirming the correct identification of the crystal axes .",
    "the @xmath0si nmr lines were measured as a function of temperature at two different magnetic fields , with the external field being applied along the crystallographic @xmath53 or @xmath54 axis .",
    "spectra above the antiferromagnetic transition were recorded with a standard spin  echo technique , while at lower temperatures the line intensities were established by a superposition of frequency sweeps as described in ref .  .",

    "a much smaller shift is observed when @xmath56 and likewise the line splitting for @xmath57 is considerably reduced .",

    "the monotonic decrease of the resonance frequency with increasing temperature in the paramagnetic phase ( see fig .  [",

    "this was indeed reported in previous works@xcite and confirmed by our low - field magnetization data ( see fig .  [",

    "although the chosen temperature range is too broad to really reflect a truly critical regime , the exponent @xmath64 is very close to @xmath65 , the value obtained from zero - field neutron diffraction data.@xcite figure  [ fig : figure2]c also confirms that the monotonic increase of the order parameter for @xmath57 does not depend on field .",
    "indeed , for @xmath66 , practically the same ordered moment at saturation is found for @xmath67 t and 7 t.    the postulated collinear antiferromagnetic order for @xmath57 is known to have a zero - field saturation moment of 0.15 @xmath13 and an easy axis which coincides with the @xmath19 direction.@xcite as shown in fig .",

    "<S> heisenberg spin- chain materials are known to substantially alter their static and dynamic properties when experiencing an effective transverse staggered field originating from the varying local environment of the individual spins . </S>",
    "<S> we present a temperature- , angular- and field - dependent @xmath0si nmr study of the model compound bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental data are interpreted in terms of the divergent low - temperature transverse susceptibility , predicted by theory for spin chains in coexisting longitudinal and transverse staggered fields . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis first employs a finite - temperature  density matrix renormalization group \" ( dmrg ) study of the relevant one - dimensional hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> next we compare our numerical with the presently known analytical results . with an analysis based on crystal symmetries </S>",
    "<S> we show how the anisotropic contribution to the sample magnetization is experimentally accessible even below the ordering temperature , in spite of its competition with the collinear order parameter of the antiferromagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> the modification of static and dynamic properties of the system due to the presence of a local transverse staggered field ( ltsf ) acting on the one - dimensional spin array are argued to cause the unusual spin reorientation transitions observed in bacu@xmath1si@xmath1o@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> on the basis of a ginzburg - landau type analysis , we discuss aspects of competing spin structures in the presence of magnetic order and the enhanced transverse susceptibility . </S>"
