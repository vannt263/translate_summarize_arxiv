    "the term @xmath23 implements the damping mechanism of the @xmath2 model by gurau  _ et al . _",
    "it is of inherently non - local nature and gives rise to an infinite number of gauge boson vertices as described in ref .",
    "however , there are several approaches for localization which deserve to be discussed in more detail below in section  [ sec : localization ] .",
    "first , we briefly review our early attempts in this endeavour which led to the introduction of additional degrees of freedom .",
    "subsequently , as an alternative way to tackle the problem , a modified version of the model with auxiliary fields forming brst doublet structures is discussed .",
    "this latter approach aims to form a basis for the application of algebraic ( or equivalently any other ) renormalization which will be postponed to a future publication .",
    "the uv power counting is discussed in section  [ sec : power_counting ] , and a short conclusion and outlook are given in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "recently two different methods of localization for terms of the type @xmath0 have been proposed @xcite . in the following these approaches shall be reviewed briefly .",

    "however , this method introduces new physical degrees of freedom which can only be avoided if the new terms in the action are written as an exact brst variation . in order for such a mechanism to work ,",
    "further unphysical fields are required .",
    "recently , vilar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite found an alternative way to rewrite the critical term by introducing two pairs of auxiliary complex conjugated antisymmetric tensorial fields @xmath26 , and @xmath27 of mass dimension one , @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a parameter of mass dimension one .",
    "the term @xmath30 is now split into a brst invariant part @xmath31 , and a breaking term @xmath32 as can be seen by explicit calculation with the definitions in ref .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom are eliminated by following the ideas of zwanziger  @xcite ( see @xcite for a more comprehensive review of the topic ) to add a ghost for each auxiliary field in such a way that brst doublet structures are formed .",
    "this results in a trivial brst cohomology for @xmath31 from which follows  @xcite that @xmath33 i.e. the part of the action depending on the auxiliary fields and their associated ghosts can be written as an exact expression with respect to the nilpotent brst operator @xmath34 .",
    "unfortunately the breaking term does not join this nice property due to a non - trivial cohomology .",
    "however , it is constructed such that its mass dimension is smaller than four , the dimension of the underlying euclidean space .",
    "such a breaking is referred to as `` soft '' ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) and does not spoil renormalizability .",
    "in fact , @xmath32 is the actual origin of the avoidance of uv / ir mixing featured by this theory as it alters the ir sector while not affecting the uv part .",
    "the mechanism of soft breaking in combination with uv renormalization will be discussed in the subsequent sections below .",
    "the starting point is the gauge invariant part @xmath35 ( c.f . eqn .",

    "as has been shown in @xcite the auxiliary field @xmath24 appears to have its own dynamic properties representing additional degrees of freedom .",
    "following @xcite we introduce an additional pair of ghost and antighost fields @xmath36 and @xmath37 , and furthermore turn @xmath24 into a complex conjugated pair ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) of fields in order to replace eqn .",
