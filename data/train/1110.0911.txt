    "the notion of transmitting data over powerlines has posed an interesting challenge for information and coding theory .",
    "the noise characteristics of such a communication channel include permanent narrowband noise , impulse noise and white gaussian noise .",
    "communication over this channel also has an additional requirement that the power envelope be as close to constant as possible .",
    "vinck @xcite studied this channel and showed that @xmath0-ary frequency shift keying ( @xmath0-fsk ) modulation , in conjunction with the use of permutation codes , provides a constant power envelope , frequency spreading and redundancy to correct errors resulting from the harsh noise pattern .",
    "this has since resulted in research on frequency permutation arrays ( fpas ) and constant composition codes ( cccs ) which retain the property of a constant power envelope ( see @xcite , and @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "every codeword of an fpa or a ccc has the requirement that the frequency of each symbol is fixed by the parameters of the code .",
    "versfeld@xcite introduced the notion of the `` same - symbol weight '' of a code by relaxing the requirement that every symbol must occur a fixed number of times in any codeword . in every codeword of a same - symbol weight code , the frequency of any symbol is bounded .",
    "even with this relaxation it is possible to detect permanent narrowband noise .",
    "versfeld@xcite used reed - solomon codes to design codes with specified same - symbol weight .    in this work we mostly study the asymptotic behavior of codes in the symbol weight space .",
    "we use the term _ bounded symbol weight _ ( as opposed to same - symbol weight @xcite ) to denote all words in the hamming space with bounded symbol weight , that is , any symbol in a codeword does not occur more than a fixed number of times , say @xmath1 this terminology is adopted in order to distinguish this space from the _ constant symbol weight space _ , in which every symbol in a word in the hamming space occurs at most @xmath2 times and there exists one symbol which occurs exactly @xmath2 times .",
    "the constant symbol weight space is clearly a subset of the bounded symbol weight space .",
    "we also use the term symbol weight space to refer to either the bounded symbol weight or constant symbol weight space . the actual space",
    "being referred to is made clear from the context and notation .",
    "as described in @xcite , the symbol weight determines whether the code can detect and correct narrowband noise in the powerline channel .",
    "an fpa or a ccc belongs to some constant symbol weight space .",
    "the constant symbol weight space also contains other compositions all of which have the same maximal part , that is , all such codes have the same fixed symbol weight .",
    "thus a code in the constant symbol weight space is larger than a ccc of a fixed composition , and is still relevant for correcting narrowband noise .",
    "the asymptotic behavior of fpas have been studied in @xcite .",
    "in contrast , there are relatively fewer results on the asymptotic behavior of cccs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we consider familiar techniques used to derive classical bounds such as the gv bound , the johnson bound and the singleton bound , on codes in the symbol weight space .",
    "however , the derivation of these results are not immediate because of the lack of any reasonable structure in the symbol weight spaces",
    ". in particular , even the hamming balls of a fixed radius in these spaces depend on the center of the ball . in section [ sec : lower - bnd - sw ] , we also study non - asymptotic bounds on codes in the symbol weight spaces by expressing them in terms of different cccs .",
    "this also raises related combinatorial questions regarding the size and construction of optimal codes , which can be an interesting avenue of future research .",
    "in later sections we show that there exists codes , which are subsets of reed - solomon codes , with high rate and relative distance , which are a subset of the constant symbol weight space .    throughout this work",
    "we are mostly concerned with codes that have positive rate and positive relative distance .",
    "hence we do not study codes with very large distances , in the plotkin region .",
    "we start with some basic definitions and notations in the following section .",
    "we devote section [ sec : asymp - sws ] to deriving the exact and asymptotic size of the symbol weight spaces .",
    "the results in section [ sec : asymp - sws ] allow us to determine which constant composition space contained within the symbol weight space contributes the most to the rate of a symbol weight space .",
    "these estimates are used in section [ sec : sw - asymp ] to determine upper and lower bounds on bounded symbol weight and constant symbol weight codes . in particular , it is clear that asymptotically some constant composition code determines the rate of a symbol weight code .",
    "an upper bound is readily obtained from either the singleton bound or the linear programming bound in the hamming space . in section [ sec : sw - asymp ] we also provide a johnson - type bound on codes in the constant symbol weight space , and use this bound to derive an asymptotic improvement of the singleton bound and the linear programming bound for certain ranges of the minimum distances and the symbol weight . in section [ sec : lower - bnd - sw ] we provide non - asymptotic lower bounds on symbol weight codes . we introduce a new metric on the space of compositions of an integer and use this metric to lower bound the size of symbol weight codes by a sum of sizes of cccs . finally , in section [ sec : constructions ] we provide other constructions of constant symbol weight codes , and in particular show that the asymptotic lower bound presented in section [ sec : asymp - sws ] is tight for certain parameters , for subcodes of reed - solomon codes .",

    "an fpa consists of vectors in which every symbol occurs a fixed number , say @xmath32 , of times .",

    "the demodulator considered is a hard - decision demodulator consisting of an envelope detector with a threshold . at every time instance",
    ", the demodulator provides a multivalued output consisting of all the symbols that correspond to frequencies at which the output of the envelope detector exceeds the threshold . a narrowband noise in this context results in the same symbol appearing at all time instances .",
    "as explained in versfeld@xcite , a linear code is less effective in this channel .",
    "for instance , the all - zero codeword can not be distinguished from a narrowband noise .",
    "hence , permutation codes , fpas and cccs are more suitable for communication in this channel . to understand why we study the constant symbol weight space , consider the following example .",
    "+    consider a ccc in @xmath37 with composition @xmath38 $ ] and minimum distance @xmath39 , that is suitable for correcting narrowband noise in a powerline channel .",
    "let @xmath40 be a codeword in this ccc .",
    "then the vector @xmath41 is also a suitable vector for correcting narrowband noise .",
    "however this vector belongs to a different constant composition space that contains vectors with composition @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "both these constant composition spaces are a subset of the constant symbol weight space with symbol weight 3 . in section  [ sec : lower - bnd - sw ] , we prove that since the compositions @xmath38 $ ] and @xmath42 $ ] have distance @xmath43 in a specific metric that we define later , any vector from the constant composition space with composition @xmath38 $ ] will be at a distance at least 4 from any vector of the other space with composition @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "hence , we can increase the size of the code by including all the codewords from a ccc in the latter space .",
    "+    it is clear that any constant symbol weight space with symbol weight @xmath2 can be written as the union of different constant composition spaces , each of which contains vectors with the same symbol weight @xmath2 .",

    "unfortunately , the expression for the size of the symbol weight spaces is unwieldy and gives little insight into the behavior of the lower bounds .",
    "the symbol weight spaces are also not ball - homogeneous , that is , the size of a hamming ball in the space depends on the center of the ball .",

    "this fact makes it difficult to state decent lower bounds .",
    "similar comments apply to the computation of the hamming bound .",
    "hence , in the following two sections , we instead study the asymptotic behavior of the symbol weight spaces and the rate of the corresponding symbol weight codes .    in the following section we determine the asymptotic size of the symbol weight space .",

    "hence the count above provides a lower bound on the rate of @xmath506 : @xmath507 the upper bound on the rate of @xmath506 is obtained by applying both lemma [ lem : wt - distr ] and proposition  [ prop : sw - le - wt - distr ] .",
    "we get @xmath508 and , @xmath509    let @xmath510 be a codeword in the reed - solomon code . then @xmath277 is the image of a polynomial @xmath511 evaluated at all points of @xmath512 . we write @xmath513 if @xmath277 resulting from @xmath511 has symbol weight exactly @xmath2",
    "then so do the codewords obtained from the polynomials @xmath514 for @xmath515 consider the subset @xmath516 of @xmath468 that is obtained by retaining exactly one monic polynomial from the set @xmath517 for any polynomial @xmath511 .",
    "thus , the size of @xmath516 satisfies @xmath518 .",
    "we claim that @xmath519 . to show this",
    ", we claim that there exists an injection mapping from @xmath516 to the set of all vectors of weight @xmath520 .",
    "since any @xmath511 in @xmath516 has symbol weight exactly @xmath2 , there exists a @xmath521 such that @xmath522 has exactly @xmath2 distinct roots .",
    "thus , the codeword @xmath523 has hamming weight exactly @xmath462 this is the only such vector . if there exists @xmath524 and @xmath486 such that @xmath525 , then the two polynomials @xmath511 and @xmath526 must satisfy the relation @xmath527 since they are the same on @xmath477 points and their degrees are at most @xmath528 .",
    "thus , @xmath529 , which is not possible since @xmath516 contains exactly one polynomial of this form .",
    "the expression for the weight distribution satisfies ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 11)):@xmath530 retaining only the first term gives the required upper bound on @xmath471 .",
    "the above expression can be rewritten as @xmath531 - \\\\          { i}(2\\nmid k - r-1)\\binom{n - r}{k - r-1}(q-1)\\bigg\\},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath532 is an indicator function that is 1 if @xmath533 does not divide @xmath534 and 0 otherwise .",
    "we show that each of the terms in the summation above is positive and hence we can upper bound @xmath471 by only the first term .",
    "this is proved via the following sequence of inequalities . for any @xmath535 , we have    crl & j ( q^k - r - j-1 )  & > ( q^k - r - j-1 - 1 ) + & q^k - r - j - 1  & > ( q^k - r - j-1 - 1 ) + & q  & > .",
    "we use the inequality @xmath536 .",
    "this expression is greater than the rhs of the above because of the inequalities @xmath537 , @xmath538 , and @xmath539 .",
    "this proves the lemma .      for correcting narrowband noise in the powerline channel ,",
    "it is desirable that the symbol weight be close to the minimum possible value of @xmath540 .",
    "it remains open to determine a large subset of the reed - solomon code for the case @xmath541 .",
    "it follows from proposition [ prop : sw - le - wt - distr ] that the rate of this subset can not exceed the gv - type bound @xmath542 .",
    "the more interesting question is whether this bound can be achieved , especially in the cases where @xmath2 is small .",
    "the work of konyagin and pappalardi @xcite gives an affirmative answer to this question in the case of @xmath543 and for low relative distance @xmath544 they show that the number of permutation polynomials of degree at most @xmath545 is approximately @xmath546 for @xmath547 .",
    "this is asymptotically , @xmath548 where @xmath549 .    for the other ranges of @xmath2",
    ", when @xmath2 is growing with @xmath23 we believe that it should be possible to attain the gv bound .",
    "for instance , it would be interesting to prove that for large @xmath550 , and for any irreducible polynomial @xmath494 of degree @xmath534 , there exists @xmath2 distinct and nonzero points @xmath551 in @xmath491 such that the polynomial @xmath552 has symbol weight exactly @xmath1 since most of the count of polynomials attaining constant symbol weight @xmath2 comes from the count of irreducible polynomials , proving this will show that the rate attains the gv - type bound .",
    "we have obtained no counterexample on performing an exhaustive computer search over all such irreducible polynomials @xmath494 of degree @xmath553 , with @xmath554 in all finite fields up to @xmath555 .",
    "we are unable to verify for larger fields because the computations become prohibitive .",
    "we believe that the conjecture is not true for very small @xmath2 ( when @xmath2 does not grow with @xmath14 ) .",
    "for instance for @xmath270 the polynomial @xmath556 , where @xmath557 is an irreducible polynomial in @xmath558 , has symbol weight greater than 1 for every choice of @xmath559 .",
    "we derive the asymptotic estimates of the sizes of symbol weight codes .",
    "we also provide means of obtaining lower bounds on such codes and show that it is possible to provide symbol weight codes with the minimal possible symbol weight via recursive constructions , given we start with a known such code . finally , we provided constructions of asymptotically good constant symbol weight codes .",
    "it remains open to determine families of codes with positive rate and positive relative distance with symbol weights that are optimal or close to the optimal value of @xmath540 .",
