    "ugca  86  is a magellanic spiral ( sm ) galaxy originally catalogued from optical plates by @xcite .",
    "it is also known as a0355 + 66 @xcite , and was discovered independently through its hiemission by rots ( 1979 ) , who referred to it as a0355 .",
    "ugca  86  was proposed as a member of the local group based on an analysis of a colour - magnitude diagram @xcite , but photometry of the brightest stars place it at a distance of 2.6mpc , in the ic  342/maffei group @xcite .",
    "ugca  86  is located @xmath7 southeast of the center of the scd galaxy ic 342 , implying a minimum separation of 71 kpc for the assumed distance of @xmath8 .",
    "the adopted distance is somewhat less than the 3.3 mpc distance of ic  342 @xcite , but in view of the uncertainties , ugca  86  is likely a satellite of ic 342 .",
    "its present distance from ic 342 is at least 50% larger than the distance between the milky way and the magellanic clouds .",
    "optical studies are complicated by the low galactic latitude of this galaxy ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xcite found reddening @xmath10 for hii  regions in ugca  86 , with no evidence for significant extinction inside ugca  86 .",
    "surface photometry in @xmath11 and @xmath12 by @xcite shows a nearly exponential surface brightness profile with central surface brightness @xmath13 and integrated magnitudes @xmath14 , @xmath15 . applying a standard galactic extinction curve ,",
    "the absolute magnitude in the @xmath11 band corrected for extinction is @xmath16 with an uncertainty of at least one magnitude .",
    "the extinction - corrected central surface brightness is @xmath17 .",
    "the shape of the optical isophotes is elliptical with mean axial ratio @xmath18 and major axis in p.a .",
    "the optical axial ratio implies an inclination @xmath20 for an intrinsic axial ratio @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite detected numerous hii  regions in ugca  86  adding up to a total star formation rate of @xmath22 .",
    "most of the star formation is concentrated in three hii  region complexes southeast and southwest of the center of ugca  86 .",
    "the most prominent star formation complex is the `` cometary '' component to the south east ( see figure  20 of buta & mccall 1999 ) .",
    "that component is catalogued as viizw  009 , and is well resolved into stars .",
    "it was suggested to be a separate , disturbed galaxy by @xcite , but has since been shown to be a part of ugca  86  @xcite .",
    "@xcite likened the cometary component to the 30  doradus complex in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the metallicity of hii  regions 81 and 101 in @xcite is @xmath23 , comparable to the large magellanic cloud @xcite .",
    "both these hii  regions are associated with the cometary knot southeast of the center of ugca  86 .",
    "@xcite argued that the cometary component is a more recent burst of star formation than the central part of the galaxy , and speculated that it was triggered by infall of gas .",
    "infrared work on this galaxy has concentrated on the prominent hii  regions in the south - west regions of the galaxy , with similar conclusions @xcite .",
    "an x - ray source is located near the core ( rosat source 1rxp j035951 + 6708.6 ) , and has been suggested as being a low - mass x - ray binary @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that ugca  86  is rotating , with a perturbed velocity field , and identified it as a magellanic dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "his hi  mass reduced to a distance of 2.6 mpc is @xmath24 .",

    "@xcite further suggested that ugca  86  is tidally interacting with ic  342 as a means of explaining the perturbations in the velocity fields of both galaxies . a suggestion by @xcite that ugc  2826 might be the perturber for ic  342 has since been ruled out by the high radial velocity of that galaxy @xcite .",
    "rots low - resolution ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) hi  results are the only published hi  maps of ugca  86  to date . to address this lack and investigate the possible link between ugca  86  and ic  342 ,",
    "we have mapped the decimetre radio continuum and neutral hydrogen distribution of both galaxies with @xmath33 spatial and @xmath34 velocity resolution , using the synthesis telescope at the dominion radio astrophysical observatory ( drao ) .",
    "data from a pointing centered on the optical disk of ugca  86   were acquired simultaneously in the hi - line and in continuum bands at 1420 mhz and 408 mhz ( wavelengths of 21 and 74 cm , respectively ) .",
    "data were also collected for ic  342 in a separate but overlapping pointing ( the 1420mhz primary beam diameter of the drao array is @xmath35 to half power ; at 408mhz it is @xmath36 ) .",
    "analysis of the ic  342 field is deferred to another paper .",
    "twelve sets of spacings were used , giving baselines from 12.9 m to 604.3 m at 4.3 m intervals , and yielding sensitivity to spatial structures from @xmath33 to @xmath37 at 1.4ghz ( and about 3.5 times those values at 408mhz ) .",

    "( 2000 ) for full details of the synthesis telescope .",
    "all images presented below have been corrected for primary beam attenuation .",
    "hi  line data were collected in 256 contiguous channels over a 4mhz band , spanning 844kms@xmath38 ( 3.3kms@xmath38 per channel ) with a velocity resolution of 5.2kms@xmath38 .",
    "the observation was centered at @xmath39kms@xmath38 , the heliocentric velocity of ic  342 ; ugca  86   is nominally at + 67kms@xmath38 , which is well within the same band .",
    "both right- and left - hand circular polarizations were recorded , with the two being averaged to make the final images , resulting in an rms noise per channel of 9.5mjybeam@xmath38 . to remove continuum sources ,",
    "channels free from hydrogen emission and band - edge effects were selected from each end of data - cube and averaged together ( 120 such channels were used ) , then the result was subtracted from each channel image .",
    "the spatial resolution achieved from uniformly - weighted visibilities was @xmath40 at p.a .",
    "@xmath41 ; the data presented in this paper have had a radial taper applied to increase the brightness temperature sensitivity , and have a beam of @xmath42 at p.a .",
    "a spectral line cube tapered to @xmath44 resolution was made to obtain a better signal to noise ratio for faint extended emission . the well - sampled aperture plane and inherent low signal - to - noise meant that it was not necessary to deconvolve the channel images ( a standard practice at drao ) . missing short spacings",
    "cause a mild negative bowl .",
    "the 1.4ghz continuum system records full polarization data in four 7.5mhz bands , pairs of which flank the spectrometer band .",
    "data from the four bands were gridded separately onto a common aperture plane to make a single image in each of the four stokes parameters .",
    "the synthesized beam at 1.4ghz was the same as for the radially tapered hi  data described above , and the rms noise was 0.25mjybeam@xmath38 .",
    "no significant linear or circular polarization was seen from ugca  86 .    the 408mhz continuum system records data over a 3.5mhz bandwidth , in right - hand circular polarization only . in the absence of circularly polarized signal , which is generally the case ,",
    "this may be interpreted as stokes  @xmath12 . at 408mhz",
    "the tapered synthesized beam was @xmath45 at p.a .",

    "figure  [ chanmaps - fig ] shows the hi  channel maps of ugca  86  at positive velocities .",
    "emission of ugca  86  is blended with galactic emission at velocities below @xmath47 .",
    "the location of the brightest emission associated with ugca  86  changes gradually with velocity in a way consistent with a rotating disk . at velocities beyond @xmath48",
    "the structure in the channel maps is more complex .",
    "in addition to the brighter component , a faint spur of emission extends towards the northwest .",
    "figures  [ gray : hicolumn ] and [ gray : velfield ] show the hicolumn density and velocity field , respectively , for ugca  86 . these images were constructed from a cube in which the emission from ugca  86was manually identified in each channel image and selectively masked to exclude areas with no signal . in this way we minimized the adverse effects of noise in empty regions , and the contaminating galactic hiemission at velocities below @xmath49 . in these contaminated channels",
    "we also examined position - velocity slices though the data - cube to aid in the identification of emission from ugca  86 , which has higher velocity dispersion than the galactic emission .",
    "the total hi  mass of ugca  86  derived from this masked dataset is @xmath50 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the value found by @xcite .",
    "this difference can not be attributed to resolution of the extended emission in rots map by the shortest baselines of the drao interferometer .",
    "the present data lack the sensitivity to detect the extended low column density emission in rots map , and the modest negative bowl has a negative effect on the flux when integrating over a large area .",
    "differences in the treatment of confusing galactic emission may also have contributed .",
    "note that the extended emission in the first panel of figure  [ chanmaps - fig ] is considered galactic here .",
    "the distribution of neutral hydrogen has a maximum column density of @xmath51@xmath52 .",
    "the distribution is approximately elliptical in outline for column densities higher than @xmath53@xmath52 ( figure  [ gray : hicolumn ] ) , with an extent of @xmath54 at the @xmath55 level , oriented at p.a .",
    "the axial ratio of hi  column density contours in the range @xmath57 to @xmath58 , excluding the spur , is @xmath59 .",
    "this part of ugca  86  is centered on the optical galaxy with similar axial ratio and orientation of the apparent major axis @xcite .",
    "the velocity field in this area shows a well - defined rotational velocity gradient with the receding side of the galaxy in p.a .",
    "both the hydrogen and optical disks are centered at ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) = ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "there are three prominent `` holes '' in the hi  at ( @xmath65 , @xmath66 ) , ( @xmath67 , @xmath64 ) , and ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) , in which the column density drops below @xmath70@xmath52 .    at low column densities",
    "the narrow hi  spur noticed in figure  [ chanmaps - fig ] extends towards the northwest ( the approximate direction of ic 342 ) , up to @xmath71 ( 9 kpc ) from the center of ugca  86 .",
    "this structure is also visible in the low - resolution column density map of @xcite .",
    "a faint extension of the hi  isophotes is seen on the opposite side of the disk near 04@xmath72  01@xmath73 , @xmath74  @xmath75 .",
    "the suggestion of an elongated structure that partially overlaps with the hi  disk on the sky will be confirmed later by position - velocity diagrams and hi  line profiles .",
    "the kinematics of the spur are ordered , with lower velocities occurring on the eastern side of the spur .",
    "note that the velocity changes more rapidly along the minor axis of the spur than in the disk , and that the ( apparent ) velocity gradient has a different direction .",
    "the velocity field ( figure  [ gray : velfield ] ) clearly shows the regular rotation of the disk .",
    "however , the spur affects the velocity field as it overlaps in position with the disk .",
    "the approaching side of the disk is also affected by confusion with galactic hi .",
    "a tilted ring fit @xcite to the velocity field of figure  [ gray : velfield ] was attempted to obtain the rotation curve of the disk . however , the results of the fit to the velocity field are skewed towards smaller rotation velocities because of the contaminating emission of the spur .",
    "this will be illustrated further in section  [ spur - section ] .",
    "the best representation of the rotation curve of the disk was obtained by fitting the shape of the position - velocity diagram though the kinematic major axis of the disk . the p.a . of the kinematic major axis and an initial rotation curve",
    "were determined from the tilted ring fits .",
    "the rotation velocities of the annuli and the systemic velocity were adjusted manually to force the rotation curve to follow the bright curved ridge of emission in figure  [ gray : rotcurve ] .",
    "the resulting rotation curve is listed in table  [ rotcur - table ] .",
    "the total mass of ugca  86  within the outermost radius of the rotation curve is @xmath76 .",
    "the inclination of the hi  disk is uncertain .",
    "the adopted inclination @xmath77 is based on the hi  axial ratio @xmath78 and an intrinsic axial ratio @xmath21 .",
    "if the optical inclination @xmath79 is adopted , the velocities are 15% higher than listed in table  [ rotcur - table ] .",
    "the systemic velocity found here is consistent with the values of @xcite and @xcite , but significantly smaller than the @xmath80 found by @xcite .",
    "this systematic difference may be the result of rots discarding channels affected by galactic emission , and inclusion of the spur .    a significant misalignment between the p.a . of the apparent major axis and the kinematic major axis",
    "is observed in ugca  86 .",
    "a small but significant misalignment between the kinematic and morphological major axis is not exceptional in dwarf galaxies .",
    "@xcite interpreted a similar misalignment in the dwarf irregular galaxy sex  a as evidence that the gas in the disk describes non - circular orbits .",
    "figure  [ holeslice - fig ] shows a position - velocity slice in p.a .",
    "@xmath81 , approximately along the apparent major axis of the hi  disk . a small area @xmath82 southwest of the center of ugca  86displays a significant departure from the regular rotation pattern of the disk . locally",
    "the line of sight velocity deviates by @xmath83 from the value expected from the rotation curve model of table  [ rotcur - table ] .",
    "the area where the velocity deviates more than @xmath84 from the rotation model is indicated by the ellipse in the upper panel of figure  [ holeslice - fig ] .",

    "these slices were taken from the @xmath44 resolution cube to show faint emission in the spur .",
    "galactic foreground hi  is seen at negative velocities and close to zero .",
    "the spur is clearly visible in the velocity range @xmath90 to @xmath91 , far outside the velocity range permitted by galactic rotation assuming circular orbits and a flat rotation curve .",
    "it is possible in principle that the spur is hi  in the foreground that does not follow galactic rotation .",
    "we note that the difference between heliocentric velocity and velocity with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is only @xmath92 for ugca  86 .",
    "one possibility is that the spur is a high - velocity cloud ( hvc ) along the line of sight .",
    "the hvc complexes nearest to the line of sight are complex a and complex h in the velocity range @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "association of the spur with these complexes is dismissed because of the large velocity difference . instead , the spur could be considered a compact high - velocity cloud ( chvc ) , not associated with a large complex . however , the all - sky distribution of velocities of chvcs in the lsr reference frame is dominated by the orbital velocity of the lsr around the galactic center .",
    "the velocity of the lsr has a large component in the direction of ugca  86 , and no chvcs with positive velocities in the lsr frame have been found in this part of the sky ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the probability that an extraordinary chvc with a positive velocity is found in this location is very small .",
    "for this reason , the interpretation of the spur as a chvc is rejected .",
    "@xcite reported a population of hi  clouds in the galactic halo with velocities up to @xmath48 beyond that allowed by galactic rotation",
    ". some of these clouds would be detectable in the present data @xcite .",
    "the spur is observed at much higher forbidden velocities .",
    "also , the velocity gradient of the spur and the width of the hi  line profile in the spur do not match the narrow line widths observed in these halo clouds @xcite .",
    "a distinct velocity gradient is observed along both the major and the minor axes of the spur .",
    "this indicates that the actual velocity gradient is not aligned with either the major axis or the minor axis .",
    "the direction of the actual velocity gradient across the spur was determined by interactively changing the p.a .",
    "of position - velocity slices until no velocity gradient was discernible .",

    "@xmath95 . evidence for a reversal of the velocity gradient is seen in slice d of figure  [ gray : majorslice ] towards the extreme end of the spur .",
    "figure  [ gray : majorslice ] also shows that the spur does not begin at the northwest edge of the disk , but rather overlaps on the sky with the hi  disk . the hi  line profiles are double - peaked or blended where the spur and the disk overlap as illustrated in figure  [ centerprofiles ] .",
    "double - peaked hi  line profiles with a velocity separation of @xmath96 are seen near the center of ugca  86 . southeast of the center of ugca  86",
    "the line profiles are blended so much that a kinematic separation is not possible .",
    "the asymmetric line profiles on the southeast side do suggest that the spur extends across the disk . on the extreme east side of ugca  86 , the disk itself is difficult to disentangle from galactic hi .",
    "the difference @xmath97 in the line of sight velocity of the spur and the disk towards the center of ugca  86   is a direct measurement of the velocity component of spur gas in the direction of the center of mass of ugca  86 , as defined by the optical galaxy .",
    "the radial component of the spur gas in this direction is a significant fraction , approximately one third , of the circular velocity at the last measured point of the rotation curve ( table  [ rotcur - table ] ) . as the rotation curve appears to turn over around a radius of @xmath98 , the velocity of a circular orbit at larger radii",
    "is not expected to exceed @xmath99 by a significant amount .",
    "therefore , the radial component of the velocity of this part of the spur is at least one third of the local circular velocity , independent of the actual distance from the center of ugca  86 .",
    "this significant radial component of the orbital velocity is a direct indication that the orbits of gas in the spur are significantly non - circular with respect to the center of ugca  86 .",
    "a determination of the mass of the spur requires decomposition of the line profiles in a disk and a spur component in places where the spur and the disk overlap on the sky .",
    "figure  [ centerprofiles ] shows that a decomposition of the line profiles into gaussians will not provide a unique solution in many places .",
    "this ambiguity was addressed by subtracting a sequence of models for the hi  disk from the data .",

    "the median error for velocity dispersions is @xmath106 in the disk , and @xmath107 in the spur .",

    "while this is consistent with a nearly flat spectrum , it is likely that not all of the emission is thermal .",
    "the association of the compact emission with hii  regions suggests that the the extended emission seen in the 21-cm continuum image may be significantly non - thermal .",
    "this is reminiscent of the extended synchrotron halo of the post - starburst dwarf galaxy ngc  1569 , which has the same global spectral index @xmath119 @xcite .",

    "ugca  86   is a member of a heterogeneous set of dwarf galaxies with very significant departures from ordered rotation in their extended hi  envelopes .",
    "these galaxies are of interest for our understanding of the formation and evolution of galaxies because of the origin of the chaotic kinematics .",
    "we distinguish three broad categories that arguably share some common characteristics : 1 .",
    "tidal interaction with another galaxy ; 2 . collision with or capture of an intergalactic hi  cloud ; 3 .",
    "assembly of the hi  disk on timescales longer than a hubble time ( `` continuing galaxy formation '' @xcite ) .    in case of tidal interaction ,",
    "the hi  displaying the peculiar kinematics is in fact the disturbed outer hi  disk .",
    "the most extreme case of tidal interaction is a merger with another galaxy . in the case of a collision or capture of an intergalactic gas cloud or a smaller dwarf galaxy ,",
    "the gravitational force on ugca  86  may be negligible , but the infalling material may create large holes in the gas distribution and compress the interstellar medium to high densities in some places , triggering star formation @xcite . the case of ongoing galaxy formation",
    "assumes that the hi  was always bound to the dwarf galaxy , but has not yet been assimilated into the disk .",
    "an interesting question is why most dwarf galaxies do appear to have formed an hi  disk , or even converted all of the available gas into stars .",
    "the main difference between a collision and ongoing assimilation is the time scale of the process . both may be characterized as infall .",
    "the relative importance of these processes is not well known .",
    "the number of ( dwarf ) galaxies with chaotic kinematics in their outer parts and the details of their kinematics provide important clues regarding the relative importance of these processes .",
    "this may in turn provide insight in similar processes occurring in galaxies at high redshift .",
    "although the orbits of the gas are not uniquely constrained by the observations , some constraints may be given if a geometry is specified .",
    "an important observation is the steep velocity gradient along the minor axis of the spur observed in figure  [ gray : minorslice ] .",
    "this velocity gradient is difficult to explain if the the spur is a filament , with its dimension along the line of sight equal to its minor axis on the sky .",
    "it would require a special short - lived geometry , or a mass concentration in the spur to balance the velocity shear and maintain its filamentary structure .",
    "it is more likely that the velocity gradient across the spur displays the line of sight component of the orbital velocity of gas in a structure that is extended along the line of sight .",
    "this argument is equally valid whether the orbits of the spur gas are open or closed .",
    "the large range in the hi  velocity dispersion of the spur ( figure  [ gray : histo ] ) is also most easily explained in terms of a superposition of multiple velocity components along the line of sight .",
    "much of the following discussion is based on this argument .",
    "the hi  velocity field around the optical galaxy shows the structure expected for a disk with well - ordered rotation .",
    "the first question that comes to mind is whether the spur is an extension of the hidisk of ugca  86 .",
    "the outer hi  disk may not show well - ordered rotation as a result of tidal interaction with ic  342 , or because it has not had the time to settle into a disk .",
    "however , if the spur is to be considered an extension of the disk , the orbits of hi  in the spur should be reasonably circular around the optical galaxy and approximately in the plane of the observed hi  disk .",
    "it should be noted that some dwarf galaxies appear to have significant warps in their outer hi  disks , suggested by their twisted hi  isophotes and a change in p.a . of the velocity field .",
    "examples are ddo  168 @xcite , um  439 @xcite , and ngc  4449 @xcite",
    ".    three lines of argument indicate that the gas in the spur does not satisfy these requirements .",
    "first , the spur partially overlaps in position on the sky with the hi  disk , but not in velocity .",
    "this implies that at least this part of the spur is significantly out of the plane of the disk , because the orbits of gas in the spur can not cross the orbits of gas in the disk .",
    "the second argument follows from the difference in the line of sight velocity between the spur and the disk in the direction of the optical center of ugca  86 .",
    "although the rotation curve analysis of the velocity field did not uniquely define the position of the center of mass of ugca  86 , it is reasonable to assume that the center of mass is close to the optical center , as it is for larger disk galaxies .",
    "the correspondence between the morphology of the optical and the hi  isophotes supports this assumption .",
    "the velocity difference @xmath97 is therefore the radial component of the orbital velocity of gas in the spur , with respect to the dynamical center of ugca  86 . for ugca  86 ,",
    "@xmath120 is about one third of the circular velocity of the outer disk at radius @xmath121 ( 6 kpc ) .",
    "this large radial velocity component relative to the local circular velocity implies that the orbit is significantly non - circular .",
    "the first and second arguments combined imply that the part of the spur that is observed in the direction of the optical center is probably further from the dynamic center than the observed radius of the hi  disk ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "the distance of this part of the spur from the plane of the disk is then at least @xmath123 for the adopted inclination @xmath124 .",
    "the third argument that the spur is not an extension of the hi  disk is that differential rotation would wind - up the spur on an orbital time scale @xmath125 .",
    "the linear appearance of the spur would be highly coincidental because it would exist only for a short time .",
    "the conclusion is that the hi  spur is not an extension of the hidisk .",
    "this also excludes the possibility that the spur is an hispiral arm similar to those observed in the extended outer hi  disks of some dwarf galaxies , such as ngc  2915 @xcite and ddo  47 @xcite .",
    "at least some hi  in the spur is found to follow non - circular orbits at a high inclination with respect to the plane of the hi  disk .",
    "ugca  86  is not unique in this respect .",
    "highly structured outer hi  with kinematics different from a disk that coincides with the optical galaxy has been reported for ngc  4449 @xcite , izw  18 @xcite , iizw  40 @xcite and ngc  1569 @xcite .",
    "iizw  40 is a clear example of a merger in progress .",
    "the hi  filaments in ngc  4449 may be the result of tidal interaction .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the extended hi  in izw  18 is a remnant of the nascent cloud from which the galaxy formed .",
    "there is no known companion of ngc  1569 that could have caused the disturbed kinematics in its outer regions through tidal interaction .",
    "these examples show that there may not be a single origin of the disturbed hi  kinematics in these systems .",
    "it is not possible in general to decide unambiguously which process occurs from hi  observations of a particular galaxy .",
    "the proximity of ic  342 suggests that the spur may be the result of tidal interaction with this much larger neighbor .",
    "if the spur is a tidal tail induced by ic  342 , some inferences can be made based on the kinematics and morphology of the spur .",
    "first , the velocity of the spur in the direction of the center of ugca  86   is blue shifted relative to the hi  disk .",
    "a tidal tail is expected to have a radial velocity component away from the center .",
    "this implies that the blue shifted spur gas should be located in front of the hi  disk .",
    "second , the 3-dimensional space velocity of the gas in a tidal tail is expected to vary smoothly with position along the tidal tail because adjacent test particles in the tidal tail always experienced similar accelerations during the interaction .",
    "this continuity of the spacial velocity should be seen in the data as a smooth gradient of the line of sight velocity along the tidal tail .",
    "the observed variation of the line of sight velocity along the _ minor _ axis of the spur is not necessarily in conflict with this expectation .",
    "the minor - axis velocity gradient may be the result of a projection effect where different parts of the tidal tail are seen close together on the plane of the sky .",
    "for this to be the case , the tidal tail must be in a plane that is observed nearly edge - on .",
    "the orientation of the spur along the minor axis of the optical and hi  isophotes of the disk of ugca  86   further means that the plane of the tidal tail makes a large angle ( close to @xmath126 ) with the plane of the disk , no matter what the inclination of the disk might be .",
    "third , the fact that the spur extends on the sky in the direction of ic  342 , and the necessity that the spur is in a plane observed nearly edge - on , mean that ic  342 must be close to the plane of the spur .",
    "fourth , if different parts of the tidal tail are to be seen in projection on the sky along the entire spur , the tip of the spur that appears most distant from ugca  86   is a point where the line of sight is approximately a tangent to the tidal tail .",
    "if this is the case , one would expect that the spur is brighter at this point and that the velocity gradient along the minor axis vanishes .",
    "this expectation is confirmed by figure  [ gray : minorslice ] .    the inference that ic  342 is in the same plane as the tidal tail is an interesting argument in favor of an interpretation of the spur as a tidal tail induced by ic  342 .",
    "however , significant problems exist with this interpretation .",
    "if the spur is a tidal tail in a nearly polar plane , significant warping of the outer hi  disk of ugca  86  is also expected to occur .",
    "this warp should manifest itself by a change in p.a . of the hi  isophotes and the velocity field of the disk .",
    "no such variation in p.a . is observed in figure  [ gray : hicolumn ] and figure  [ gray : velfield ] .",
    "@xcite similarly argued that the component hi - sx in izw  18 is not a tidal tail because of lack of continuity in the velocity field between the components hi - a and hi - sx .",
    "the necessity of a tidal tail in a plane that is perpendicular to the plane of the disk is by itself a problem because low - inclination encounters seem to be most effective in the formation of tidal tails @xcite .",
    "finally , in the inferred geometry the tidal tail appears in the direction of ic  342 , with no evidence for a counter tail .",
    "this is contrary to simulations of tidally interacting disk galaxies , where the counter tail is the most prominent tidal feature @xcite .",
    "detailed modeling specific to this system is required to make these arguments conclusive .",
    "ugca  86   currently experiences a period of enhanced star formation .",
    "the detection of ugca  86   in the radio continuum , especially at 408 mhz , indicate exceptional star forming activity for a dwarf galaxy .",
    "further evidence for significant recent star formation is seen in the numerous hii  regions and the cometary knot .    it is tempting to associate the spur with the current star formation in ugca  86 .",
    "gas falling into the disk as suggested by @xcite and @xcite may have triggered the recent episode of star formation .",
    "indirect evidence that this may have occurred is found in the region with anomalous velocity shown in figure  [ holeslice - fig ] .",
    "this region occurs on the side of ugca  86that displays the most intense star formation .",
    "if the kinetic energy of this region is supplied by stellar winds and supernovae , the equivalent of more than 200 supernova explosions is required .",
    "the integrated star formation rate of ugca  86  of @xmath127 implies a supernova rate of @xmath128 supernovae per year for the entire galaxy , assuming a salpeter imf with low mass cut - off @xmath129 and high - mass cut - off @xmath130 .",
    "the main hii  regions are found on the periphery of the anomalous velocity region , not near the center .",
    "the power and the location of the star formation regions suggest that the observable population of high - mass stars is not the source of the anomalous velocity region .",
    "the impact of high - velocity clouds in a galactic disk has been suggested as an alternative energy source for super shells with very high energy requirements @xcite .",
    "the presence of the spur and a kinematically disturbed region in the disk that requires more energy input than the observable stars can provide , lends some credibility to the suggestion of gas falling into ugca  86 .",
    "we present hi , and 1.4 ghz and 408 mhz continuum observations of the magellanic dwarf irregular galaxy ugca  86  with the drao interferometer .",
    "the hi  morphology of ugca  86  is characterized by a rotating disk with inclination @xmath131 , but a significant misalignment exists between the optical / hi  major axis and the kinematic major axis .",
    "in addition to this , a narrow spur of hiextends to the northwest , up to @xmath71 ( 9 kpc ) from the center of ugca  86 .",
    "the spur is oriented along the apparent minor axis of the disk of ugca  86 , and its kinematics are significantly different from the disk .",
    "the spur partially overlaps with the disk on the sky .",
    "the velocity difference between the spur and the disk towards the center of ugca  86  is @xmath120 . in this direction",
    "we measure directly the radial component of the orbital velocity of gas in the spur .",
    "this large radial component , one third of the circular velocity at the edge of the hi  disk , is evidence that the orbits of gas in the spur are significantly non - circular . also",
    ", the overlap of the spur and the disk on the sky , and the modest inclination of the disk imply that part of the spur is located well outside the plane of the disk , but no evidence for a warp of the outer hi  disk is found . a well - defined velocity gradient is observed along both the major and the minor axes of the spur .",
    "the mean hi  velocity dispersion of the disk @xmath132 is similar to what is observed in other ( dwarf ) galaxies .",
    "however , the velocity dispersion of hi  in the spur shows a large range , from @xmath29 to @xmath6 .",
    "ugca  86   is also detected in the continuum at 1.4 ghz and 408 mhz .",
    "the 1.4 ghz continuum image shows the three largest hii  region complexes , and an extended component that covers the entire optical disk of ugca  86 . at 408 mhz ,",
    "the galaxy is unresolved .",
    "the global spectral index between 408 mhz and 1.4 ghz is @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the interpretation of the spur as a tidal tail induced by ic  342 , following an earlier suggestion by @xcite is considered . in order to explain the observed hi  kinematics of the spur",
    ", the tidal tail must be in a plane that is nearly perpendicular to the disk , although no warping of the outer hi  disk is observed .",
    "also , the spur is oriented in the direction of ic  342 , which means that the prominent tidal tail is located in between the two interacting galaxies .",
    "detailed modeling of the interaction between ic  342 and ugca  86   is necessary to address these objections against a tidal tail interpretation of the spur .",
    "if the spur is not a tidal tail , it is likely gas in an extended , non - circular orbit around ugca  86 .",
    "this gas may then be a remnant of the from the formation of ugca  86   that has not yet settled into the disk , or an unlucky small dwarf galaxy that was tidally disrupted by ugca  86 .",
