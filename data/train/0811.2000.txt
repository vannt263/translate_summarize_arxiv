    "band p - l relations were derived by matching the ogle - ii cepheids and the cepheids sample from @xcite , done in @xcite and @xcite respectively , to the sage ( surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ) archival data .    in this paper",

    "in addition , one unexpected result from the ogle - ii based p - l relation is that the optical lmc p - l relation was found to be non - linear ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * and reference therein ) . we will also test the non - linearity of the extinction corrected ogle - iii p - l relations using rigorous statistical tests .",
    "the data for ogle - iii fundamental mode ( fu ) cepheids were kindly provided for us by i. soszyski : this included the celestial coordinates , the mean @xmath6 band magnitudes , and the periods for @xmath7 cepheids .",

    "five cepheids without @xmath4 and @xmath5 band mean magnitudes were excluded from the sample .",
    "we also excluded the 11 cepheids with @xmath8 ( where @xmath9 is the pulsation period ) that only have @xmath4 band data .",
    "the observed magnitudes of these cepheids are close to the saturation limit of the ogle - iii survey ( at @xmath10 mag .",

    "the @xmath104-test results show that our p - l slopes disagree and agree ( except for the @xmath65 band p - l slope ) to the published results , respectively .",
    "we further test the non - linearity of the p - l relations using the @xmath171-test to the ogle - iii cepheids , and found that the lmc @xmath2 band p - l relations are non - linear but linear in @xmath3 and the four _ irac _ bands , respectively .",
    "it has to be cautious that the @xmath64 and @xmath65 p - l relations may be affected by incomplete bias at the faint end and/or mass - loss .",
    "it is worth pointing out that both macho and ogle - iii samples show the same non - linear / linear results in @xmath112 bands , where both samples have relatively large number of cepheids and cover the similar region in the lmc .",
    "the authors would like to thank i. soszyski for the help on retrieving the ogle - iii cepheid data , and an anonymous referee for the suggestions to improve the manuscript .",
