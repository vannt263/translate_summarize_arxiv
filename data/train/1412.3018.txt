    "its combination of sensitivity , bandwidth and sky coverage make alfalfa the first wide area h  i  survey to sample a cosmologically significant volume , delivering robust determinations of the h  i  mass , width , and diameter functions , the h  i  correlation function , and the cosmic density of h  i  at @xmath80 ( martin etal .  2010 ;",

    ", the final alfalfa database will contain more than 30,000 high s / n h  i  detections .    as discussed in @xcite , the 40% alfalfa catalog ( hereafter `` @xmath1.40 '' ) contains 15,855 extragalactic h  i  sources .",
    "less than 1.5% of these sources were not clearly identified with an associated stellar population ( hereafter referred to as an `` optical counterpart '' ) in an optical survey ( sdss or dss ) . of these , only @xmath050 were not readily associated with a known structure or nearby h  i  source ( that is , roughly 75% of these `` dark '' candidates are likely tidal in origin ) .",
    "the nature of the remaining objects remains unclear ; their optical associations are often ambiguous given the alfalfa pointing accuracy ( @xmath026  for reasonable s / n sources ) and unresolved given the alfalfa beam ( 3.5 ) . as discussed in detail below ,",
    "there are only a few viable candidate `` dark '' galaxies in the current literature ; the rich population of sources measured by alfalfa is a promising place to look for more .    to probe the nature of these candidate `` dark '' objects , we have initiated the alfalfa `` almost darks '' program : a comprehensive , multi - wavelength follow - up observing campaign to characterize the nature of alfalfa h  i  detections that were not identified with an unambiguous optical counterpart in initial alfalfa processing .",
    "we anticipate that detailed studies of these objects will result in the confirmation of associated optical counterparts for the vast majority of systems .",
    "figure  [ images - selection ] shows these objects in comparison to the full @xmath1.40 catalog ; the 11,300 alfalfa sources with good sdss photometry ( see haynes etal .",
    "2011 ) are plotted as either individual black points , or as colored contours at 10% levels ( between 10% and 90% ) of the number density of sources .",
    "optical luminosities for these sources are calculated using sdss catalog magnitudes from the alfalfa - sdss cross match presented in @xcite .",
    "the 52 candidate `` dark '' sources are shown in red , with the 5 objects selected for the pilot sample studied in detail in the present manuscript shown in green .",
    "these 52 sources are those that have no clear optical counterpart assigned in the initial alfalfa processing , and that were not deemed as likely to be tidal in nature .",
    "red points represent upper limits in luminosity estimated at the limiting magnitude for a source 10  in diameter in downloaded sdss images .",
    "green points that are not upper limits are calculated using the sdss catalog magnitudes of the optical counterparts identified after vla observations ; prior to source localization with the vla these objects were upper limits similar to the points plotted in red .",
    "while figure  [ images - selection ] was not used for the selection of candidate `` almost dark '' sources , it does clearly demonstrate that these systems harbor high h  i  mass to stellar light ratios ( hereafter , m@xmath3/l ) compared to the vast majority of @xmath1.40 detections .",
    "note that some sources with elevated m@xmath3/l ratios are not classified as candidate `` almost dark '' systems : these sources have clearly associated optical counterparts . further , while no strict minimum value of m@xmath3/l was enforced to create the sample of `` almost dark '' systems , an empirical threshold ( which does have significant uncertainty at low luminosity and low surface brightness ) appears around m@xmath3/l@xmath910 .",
    "in this manuscript we present pilot vla h  i  spectral line observations of 5 candidate `` almost dark '' sources .",
    "this represents the first step in a major program to understand the nature and origin of the most extreme m@xmath3/l systems within the context of various scenarios for their existence : as tidal features , as galaxies with extremely low surface brightness stellar populations , or as genuine `` dark '' galaxies .",
    "the alfalfa `` almost dark '' objects fall into four broad categories : 1 ) objects with nearby h  i  neighbors that are likely of tidal origin ; 2 ) objects that appear to be part of a system of multiple h  i  sources , but which may not be tidal in origin ; 3 ) objects isolated from nearby alfalfa h  i  detections , but located near a gas - poor early - type galaxy ; 4 ) apparently isolated sources , with no object of coincident redshift within @xmath0400 kpc .",
    "the five sources presented here ( agc193953 , agc208602 , agc208399 , agc226178 , and agc233638 ) populate each of the last three categories ( sources with a clear tidal origin from alfalfa data products were not targeted for interferometric follow - up ) .",
    "table  [ table_basic ] summarizes the basic properties of the five sources , including position , distance , and h  i  properties ( derived from alfalfa measurements ) .",
    "this limited sample is not meant to be representative of the `` almost dark '' galaxy sample as a whole ; these specific sources were selected in part to fit into pre - approved lst observing slots for vla scheduling ( see   [ s2.1 ] ) .",
    "there has been widespread interest in identifying truly `` dark '' galaxies , if they exist . with the advent of sensitive , wide - area h  i  surveys such as alfalfa , and with the increased availability of mapping observations of nearby groups with single dish telescopes , a number of candidate `` dark galaxies '' have appeared in the literature .",
    "these are systems whose h  i  properties are representative of galaxies , but that lack a clear optical counterpart .",
    "the virgohi21 cloud was originally postulated to be a true dark galaxy @xcite .",
    "however , subsequent observations @xcite and modeling @xcite have shown that this source is likely tidal in nature .",
    "more recently , single - dish telescopes have been used in mapping mode to produce deep targeted h  i  images of nearby groups .",
    "in such a survey of the m101 group , @xcite discovered a gas cloud labeled as gbt1355@xmath105439 .",
    "in that same work , very deep ground - based optical imaging revealed no obvious stellar counterpart to a limiting surface brightness of @xmath11 @xmath12 29 magarcsec@xmath13 .",
    "subsequent interferometric h  i  observations by @xcite confirm the extreme characteristics of gbt1355@xmath105439 ; both a tidal interpretation and an interpretation as a truly `` dark '' object remain viable .",

    "we discuss the details of the h  i  data reductions and image production , as well as the techniques applied to derive optical and ultraviolet ( uv ) properties from sdss and galex images .",
    "  [ s3 ] presents the h  i , optical , and uv images of each of the five sources ; using these data , we can localize the h  i  gas with confidence , assign possible optical counterparts ( by comparison with optical imaging ) , and search for ordered motions that are indicative of galaxy - like rotation . in ",
    "[ s4 ] we further discuss the five `` almost dark '' sources in the context of the alfalfa database , the low - mass galaxies within it , and also among the ( growing ) list of `` almost dark '' candidates .",
    "we draw our conclusions in   [ s5 ] ; primary among these is that none of the five candidate objects appears to qualify as a bona fide `` dark galaxy '' .",
    "h  i  spectral line imaging of the five sources presented in this work was obtained with the national radio astronomy observatory s _ karl g. jansky very large array _ ( _ vla _ ) in april , 2013 , for program 13a-028 ( legacy i d ac1116 ; p.i . cannon ) .",
    "the five sources selected for observing were the best fits based on the lst oversubscription of the vla during the 13a semester .",
    "the observations were acquired during four separate two - hour observation blocks and during one 2.5-hour block ( for source agc193953 ) with the observatory in the `` d '' ( most compact ) configuration .",
    "the widar correlator was used to divide an 8 mhz bandwidth into 1024 channels .",
    "the resulting channel separation of 7.812 khzch@xmath14 delivers a native spectral resolution of 1.65 kms@xmath14ch@xmath14 at the rest frequency of the h  i  spectral line .",
    "reductions followed standard prescriptions and used both the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) and the common astronomy software applications ( casa ) packages .",
    "radio frequency interference ( rfi ) and bad data were removed manually from each dataset .",
    "the rfi contamination of the agc193953 dataset was significant in a few channels close to those containing the source ; the loss of sensitivity in these channels has affected our recovery of flux from this source ( see further discussion below ) .",
    "bandpass and flux calibrations used the standard calibrator 3c286 for all five observing blocks . for each source , a nearby quasar was observed every @xmath020 minutes and used to calibrate the phases .",
    "we estimate our absolute flux calibration to be accurate at the @xmath010% level .",
    "the imaging of the calibrated @xmath15 databases followed standard prescriptions . to increase s / n ,",
    "each database was spectrally averaged by a factor of two , to produce a velocity resolution of 15.625 khzch@xmath14 ( 3.3 kms@xmath14ch@xmath14 ) prior to imaging .",
    "each cube was inverted with minimal cleaning , and source(s ) were identified . using these full cubes ,",
    "regions were identified that excluded h  i  line sources and bandpass edge effects . using these regions ( typically 50 channels or more , depending on the complexity of emission within each cube ) as fitting points ,",
    "the continuum was then subtracted in the @xmath15 plane using a first - order polynomial function .",
    "the final spectral line cubes used in this analysis were produced using the imagr task in aips , with a weighting robust factor of 0.5 . using clean boxes that tightly encompass the high s / n line emission , each cube",
    "was deeply cleaned to one half of the rms level found in line - free channels .",
    "residual flux rescaling was enforced during the imaging process @xcite .",
    "the moment zero maps shown below were produced following the things procedures as described in @xcite .",
    "the original - resolution cubes were convolved to the nearest integer circular sizes in arcseconds ( so , for example , the 48.97@xmath1643.00  cube for agc208602 was convolved to a circular beam size of 49 ) and were then used for all subsequent analyses .",
    "a second convolution was enacted to produce cubes with circular beam sizes @xmath010% larger ; these smoothed cubes were blanked at the 2.5@xmath17 level , closely examined by eye to retain only emission that is coherent in velocity space , and then used as masks against the original ( circular beam size ) cubes .",
    "moment zero maps ( representing total h  i  emission ) were produced by collapsing these masked cubes .",
    "the resulting images of each source are discussed in detail below .",
    "the total h  i  flux integral for each of the five sources is less than the flux integral derived from the alfalfa observations ; we discuss the recovered flux from each source in the sections that follow .",
    "the velocity structure of the h  i  gas in each source plays an important role in the interpretation of these data ; the presence of ordered gas motion is very strong evidence for classifying a candidate `` almost dark '' source as a bona - fide galaxy .",
    "as discussed in detail for each individual system below , whenever possible we have used gaussian fitting to the full ( unblanked ) datacubes in order to extract the velocity fields of the `` almost dark '' systems presented below .",
    "specifically , we use the gipsy task xgaufit to fit gaussian functions to emission above the 3@xmath17 level in regions of each datacube immediately surrounding 4 of the 5 `` almost dark '' sources ; these gaussian - fitted velocity fields are shown in the 4-panel images presented in   [ s3 ] .",
    "for agc208602 , the incoherent velocity structure of the source precluded meaningful gaussian fitting . for those `` almost dark '' sources that have neighboring h  i - rich galaxies that are detected in the datacubes ( agc208602 , agc226178 , and agc233638 )",
    ", we also show full - field images including all detected galaxies using the more traditional moment one approach ( i.e. , collapsing of the blanked data cube ) for creating the velocity fields .      to quantify the optical properties of these five `` almost dark '' sources , we extract photometry from the sloan digital sky survey 10@xmath18 data release products @xcite .",
    "mosaic frames in the sdss - g and the sdss - r bands , using primary covering fields , were created using the sdss online interface .",
    "integrated magnitudes were derived for each of the `` almost dark '' sources using the lambdar source extraction code ( wright etal .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "elliptical apertures , centered on the h  i  centroid positions ( see table  [ table_basic ] ) and with semi - major and semi - minor axis lengths as shown in table  [ table_observed ] , were used to extract the sdss - g magnitudes and ( g@xmath19r ) colors of each source .",
    "the aperture sizes and orientations were set by hand in order to enclose all of the optical flux from each source when the sdss images were displayed at the highest contrast levels .",
    "the photometry in table  [ table_observed ] is used to derive the physical parameters of the five `` almost dark '' sources shown in table  [ table_derived ] . after correcting for foreground galactic absorption @xcite ,",
    "the sdss g magnitude is converted to a johnson - cousins b magnitude via the prescriptions in table 2 of @xcite .",
    "these ( absorption corrected ) apparent magnitudes are converted to absolute magnitudes using our assumed distances from table  [ table_basic ] , and then converted to solar luminosities using the values from table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the resulting g and b - band luminosities of each `` almost dark '' source are tabulated and compared with the total h  i  masses ( using the alfalfa flux integrals ) in table  [ table_derived ] .",
    "this table reveals that the m@xmath3/l ratios span more than a factor of 10 across this small sample .",
    "it is important to stress that all of our measurements of the optical properties of these sources are brighter than the pipeline sdss values ; this is a result of the more careful aperture placement and background subtraction done here than by the standard sdss pipeline measuring tools .",
    "we use the measured r - band magnitude , ( g@xmath19r ) color , and the relations from @xcite to derive the stellar mass and m@xmath20/m@xmath21 ratio of each candidate `` almost dark '' source shown in table  [ table_derived ] .",
    "we stress that these representative stellar masses are uncertain at the @xmath050% level due to systematic uncertainties alone .",
    "nonetheless , these values can be compared to those for the full @xmath1.40 catalog using the same technique ; we explore this comparison later in this manuscript .",
    "a detailed investigation of the optical properties of the alfalfa `` almost darks '' sample is currently underway with the one degree imager ( odi ) on the wiyn 3.5 m telescope .",
    "the results of this endeavor will be presented in a forthcoming manuscript ( janowiecki etal .",
    ", in preparation ) . as of this writing , preliminary images of two members of the present sample ( agc193953 and agc233638 ) have been obtained as part of this effort . in the interests of uniformity ,",
    "we only derive quantitative results for the members of the present pilot sample from the sdss images ; the preliminary derivations of sdss g - band magnitudes for agc193953 and agc233638 from the partially filled focal plane odi ( podi ) images agree within errors with the values derived from the original sdss images .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) properties of the five `` almost dark '' sources were derived using archival galex imaging .",
    "the depth of the galex images is heterogeneous across the sample ; two sources ( agc193953 and agc233638 ) have only all - sky imaging survey depth imaging ( @xmath0100 sec per integration ) , and one of these ( agc193953 ) is a non - detection .",
    "the other three sources have deeper imaging ( @xmath01600 sec per integration ) ; one source ( agc208602 ) is a non - detection at this sensitivity level .",
    "table  [ table_observed ] shows the magnitudes in the galex near and far ultraviolet channels , measured in identical apertures to those used to extract the optical photometry shown in table  [ table_observed ] .",
    "we use the far - uv fluxes to derive the recent ( @xmath0100 myr ) star formation rates ( sfr@xmath22 ) of the sources using the prescriptions in @xcite ; these quantities are discussed in detail below .",
    "in this section we present the h  i , optical , and uv images of each of the `` almost dark '' sources .",
    "we group these five systems into three categories : isolated systems ( no known sources with coincident redshift within a projected distance of 400 kpc ) , systems with an apparent tidal origin , or systems near other objects .",
    "we classify two of the five `` almost dark '' sources as isolated ; no known sources with coincident redshift are located within a projected distance of 400 kpc of either source .",
    "agc193953 has the weakest alfalfa h  i  line flux in this small sample ( s@xmath3 @xmath12 0.43 jykms@xmath14 ; see table  [ table_basic ] ) .",
    "located at @xmath040 mpc , the h  i  line width ( w@xmath23 @xmath12 32 kms@xmath14 , where w@xmath23 is the width of the h  i  line at 50% of maximum ) and h  i  reservoir of 1.6@xmath1610@xmath24 m@xmath25  are indicative of an average dwarf galaxy .",
    "this source was initially cataloged as a `` dark '' candidate due to the extremely low surface brightness nature of the optical counterpart , which is significantly displaced from the center of the alfalfa beam .",
    "as discussed above , rfi compromised a number of channels in the datacube close to those that contain emission from the source .",
    "as such , the total h  i  flux in the vla data ( 0.13 jykms@xmath14 ) only amounts to @xmath030% of the alfalfa flux ; the h  i  properties ( e.g. , the more narrow range of velocities detected in the vla data compared to the alfalfa data ) should only be considered to be representative based on these data .",
    "figure  [ images-193953 ] shows the h  i , sdss - r band , and galex near - uv images of agc193953 . at d configuration angular resolution",
    "the source is unresolved .",
    "the h  i  gas has a single surface density concentration that reaches a maximum column density of only 6.5@xmath1610@xmath26 cm@xmath13 .",
    "this surface density maximum is slightly offset spatially ( though within one beam size ) from the very low surface brightness optical counterpart , which is clearly visible in the sdss - r band image .",

    "[ table_observed ] and [ table_derived ] show , the sdss integrated magnitudes imply a total b - band luminosity of @xmath01.9@xmath1610@xmath28 l@xmath25 and a total stellar mass of 2.2@xmath1610@xmath29 m@xmath25 .",
    "this faint stellar component is detected in the shallow galex near - uv image ; while we have no direct constraints on the nature of recent star formation ( which requires far - uv imaging ) , the faint nature of the source in the near - uv argues for quiescence over the most recent @xmath0100 myr . using the alfalfa total h  i  flux and the sdss - g and derived b - band luminosities",

    "while our analysis of the sdss images have recovered more flux than the sdss pipeline products , the source is close to the detection limits of the sdss imaging ; it is likely that deeper optical imaging would recover more low surface brightness emission , thus decreasing the m@xmath3/l and m@xmath20/m@xmath21 ratios .",

    "first , there is excellent positional agreement between the h  i  centroid and the uv - bright stellar component .",
    "second , the uv morphology of the putative stellar component suggests an inclined disk morphology . assuming circular rotation ,",
    "the orientation of this disk is perpendicular to the isovelocity contours shown in figure  [ images-226178](d ) ; this is exactly what would be expected in a rotating disk seen nearly edge - on .",
    "if the h  i  source agc226178 were instead associated with the very low surface brightness object labeled as agc229166 in figures  [ images-226178-full ] and [ images-226178 ] , then significant interpretive challenges would arise .",
    "first , the excellent positional and kinematic agreements noted above would need to occur by chance with an unrelated background source .",
    "second , the @xmath01  angular offset between the h  i  source and the centroid of agc229166 corresponds to a minimum @xmath05 kpc physical separation ( assuming agc226178 and agc229166 are at the same distance ) ; moving @xmath010@xmath38 m@xmath25  of h  i  over such a distance would require energies that could likely only arise during a gravitational interaction or ram pressure stripping event .    an alternative but speculative interpretation is one in which agc226178 and agc229166 are in fact the same physical system .",
    "there are very weak suggestions of spiral structure in the smoothed sdss - r band image of agc229166 shown in figure  [ images-226178](d ) .",
    "it is conceivable that this is a nearly face - on , gas - poor system .",
    "in such a scenario , agc226178 could be an outer spiral arm that has experienced some sort of infall or interaction episode that has ignited recent star formation .",
    "while such a scenario seems physically unlikely , it can not be completely ruled out with the present data .",
    "agc233638 was classified as a pair of galaxies with very low optical surface brightness .",
    "it is the most distant source in our pilot sample .",
    "the total alfalfa h  i  flux integral ( of which @xmath065% is recovered in our vla observations ) implies an h  i  mass of 3.3@xmath1610@xmath39 m@xmath25 .",
    "figure  [ images-233638-full ] shows that the vla observations resolve these two sources ( agc233638 and agc743043 ) , which are separated by @xmath03.3  ( @xmath0108 kpc at the adopted distance of 112 mpc ) and by less than 100 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the sdss - r band imaging allows a clear identification of an associated optical counterpart with each h  i  peak .",
    "agc233638 was included in the `` almost dark '' sample due to the ambiguous nature of multiple possible optical counterparts ; the higher spatial resolutions presented here allow us to characterize the source with confidence .    as figure  [ images-233638 ] shows , the candidate `` almost dark '' source is a star - forming dwarf irregular galaxy .",
    "there is coherent and well - ordered rotation spanning a projected velocity width of @xmath040 kms@xmath14 .",
    "the h  i  surface density maximum is exactly co - spatial with the galex centroid .",
    "while the galex images are shallow , they nonetheless allow a robust measurement of the uv fluxes in both bands ( see sdss and galex photometry in table  [ table_observed ] ) .",
    "based on the far - uv flux , this source has undergone significant star formation during the most recent @xmath0100 myr ( sfr@xmath22 @xmath12 0.05 m@xmath25yr@xmath14 ) .",
    "the m@xmath3/l and m@xmath3/m@xmath21 ratios for agc233638 are typical of those found in star - forming galaxies : m@xmath3/l@xmath30 @xmath12 3 , m@xmath3/l@xmath4 @xmath12 3 , m@xmath3/m@xmath21 @xmath12 14 .",
    "we conclude that agc233638 is a very intriguing star - forming dwarf irregular galaxy ; it has an absolute magnitude ( m@xmath4 @xmath9 @xmath1917 ) roughly equal to that of the large magellanic cloud , a total h  i  mass ( m@xmath3 = 3.2@xmath1610@xmath39 m@xmath25 ) roughly equal to that of the milky way , and a stellar mass ( m@xmath21 @xmath12 2.2@xmath1610@xmath40 m@xmath25 ) typical of those found in dwarf galaxies .",
    "a bright nuclear point source is coincident with the optical counterpart of agc233638 ; an sdss spectrum of this bright central knot is available .",
    "the sdss pipeline software proposes a redshift of @xmath41=0.940 .",
    "inspection of the sdss spectrum suggests that this high - redshift classification may be erroneous ; no obvious emission or absorption lines agree with this redshift .",
    "further , this would be highly inconsistent with the present observations of the velocity of the neutral interstellar medium .",
    "if this compact source is not associated with agc233638 itself , then the optical luminosity and resulting stellar mass of agc233638 will both decrease , raising the m@xmath3/l and m@xmath3/m@xmath21 ratios .",
    "follow - up optical spectroscopy of this compact source would be very valuable .",
    "the five `` almost dark '' sources studied in this work are representative of the sample of alfalfa - discovered systems that are not uniquely identified with optical counterparts using alfalfa data alone . as a result ,",
    "most harbor unusually high h  i  mass to light ratios . in the present work ,",
    "we use multi - wavelength follow - up observations to determine the nature of these objects : 4 sources are likely galaxies , while one source is likely a tidal remnant .    keeping in mind the uncertainties that arise because different works have measured optical properties in different ways ,",
    "the systems studied here can be compared to both the sample of alfalfa dwarf galaxies in @xcite and to the full @xmath1.40 database presented in @xcite . in figure  [ images - a40 ]",
    "we thus show the logarithm of the m@xmath3/m@xmath21 ratio versus the logarithm of the stellar mass for all of these systems .",
    "there is a clear trend for higher m@xmath3/m@xmath21 ratios in systems of fainter absolute magnitude ( lower stellar mass ) , although the scatter is significant ( becoming more pronounced as stellar mass decreases ) . with the exception of agc208399 ,",
    "the five sources studied here preferentially populate the extreme upper left region of this plot ; these are gas - rich systems with low stellar masses .",
    "a second comparison can be made against targeted studies of gas - rich , low surface brightness dwarf galaxies .",
    "for example , @xcite computes the m@xmath3/l ratios in a sample of seven low surface brightness dwarfs and a comparison sample of five dwarfs with more typical hydrogen mass to light ratios .",
    "all twelve of these systems have m@xmath3/l@xmath4 values near unity ( the lowest ratio being 0.6 in ugc891 and the highest ratio being 6.0 in ugc5716 ) .",
    "the m@xmath3/l@xmath4 values of the four `` almost dark '' systems in the present study that appear to be bona fide galaxies ( see table  [ table_derived ] ) range from 3 ( agc233638 ) to 9 ( agc193953 ) .",
    "the galaxies in the present work thus harbor m@xmath20/l@xmath4 that are comparable to the most extreme systems in @xcite .",
    "further comparisons can made with studies of low surface brightness galaxies that display elevated m@xmath3/l ratios ( e.g. , longmore etal .  1982 ; van  zee etal .  1995 ; de  blok etal .  1996 ; matthews & gallagher 1997 ; oneil etal .",
    "2000 ; doyle etal .",
    "while some physical characteristics of the present `` almost dark '' objects are similar to those found for objects in these previous studies , the alfalfa `` almost dark '' sources constitute a different class of object .",
    "for example , all of the low surface brightness sources in the @xcite sample that are within the alfalfa footprint are detected in h  i , and all of them are assigned an optical counterpart by comparison with sdss imaging .",
    "in contrast , the alfalfa `` almost dark '' sources represent the most extreme objects ( @xmath20.5% of the full alfalfa catalog ) for which an optical counterpart remains elusive , even when comparing the sensitive alfalfa and sdss / dss2b survey products .",
    "it is tempting to study the nature of the recent ( within @xmath0100 myr ) star formation in those systems in which star formation is apparent based on a measurable galex far - uv flux ( agc208399 , agc226178 , agc233638 ) . however , with the angular resolution afforded by these d configuration observations , all of these sources are only marginally resolved ( if at all )",
    ". the resulting h  i  column densities and corresponding mass surface densities will necessarily be lower limits that will increase upon observation at higher angular resolution .",
    "taken at face value , the observed column density maxima [ n@xmath3 @xmath12 ( 1 - 2)@xmath1610@xmath31 cm@xmath13 ; see figures  [ images-208399 ] , [ images-226178 ] , and [ images-233638 ] ] are significantly lower than the peak column densities observed in the more nearby galaxies of the @xcite sample [ n@xmath3 @xmath12 ( 7 - 30)@xmath1610@xmath31 cm@xmath13 ] .",
    "higher spatial resolution observations of these `` almost dark '' sources would be valuable for studying the nature of the star formation law in the extreme m@xmath3/l regime by allowing us to resolve the h  i  surface densities in the disks and correlating these values with well - understood tracers of ongoing star formation .",
    "the elevated m@xmath3/l and m@xmath3/m@xmath21 ratios in the four non - tidal `` almost dark '' candidates raise interesting questions about galaxy evolution .",
    "the h  i  masses are not unusually low for any of these sources ; as with all known non - spheroidal galaxies , an h  i  reservoir larger than 10@xmath38 m@xmath25  appears to be at least partially converted into stars . however , in these sources , this conversion appears to be extremely inefficient . using the uv - based sfrs tabulated in table  [ table_derived ]",
    ", the gas consumption timescales exceed the hubble time for all sources .",
    "these `` almost dark '' galaxies are an extreme case of inefficient star formation , similar to , but more dramatic than , what is found in the outer regions of spiral disks and in gas - dominated dwarfs ( c.f .",
    "* ) .    the angular resolution of the h  i  observations presented here results in physical resolution elements ranging from 2.5 kpc ( agc208399 ) to 32.6 kpc ( agc233638 ) .",
    "this precludes rotation curve work and a detailed mass decomposition .",
    "it is iteresting to note in this context that the objects identified as galaxies do show irregular kinematics and morphology compared to dynamically relaxed systems .",
    "for example ,",
    "agc208399 and agc226178 show lopsided kinematics ; agc193953 shows a misalignment between the total h  i  intensity and the kinematical axes ; agc223638 may be warped or show symmetric ( bar - like ) streaming motions .",
    "higher resolution observations of the nearest of these sources would facilitate an examination of the dark and baryonic components in these systems .",
    "we have presented new h  i  spectral line observations of five sources extracted from the alfalfa catalog as being representative members of the `` almost dark '' population : systems for which an optical counterpart can not be assigned using alfalfa data alone .",
    "these sources harbor extreme hydrogen mass to optical luminosity ratios . with the optical ,",
    "uv , and interferometric h  i  imaging presented in this work , we now have a much more clear understanding of the nature of these objects ; none of them appears to be a bona fide `` dark galaxy '' .",
    "the h  i  images of these sources localize the h  i  gas and provide a coarse representation of the rotation and dynamics of the neutral interstellar medium .",
    "we compare these h  i  results with sdss and galex imaging . in four of the five systems ,",
    "a stellar counterpart is detected that is co - spatial with the h  i  centroid .",
    "each of these objects shows signatures of coherent rotation ; we classify these systems as galaxies .",
    "one system in this study ( agc208602 ) lacks a detectable stellar population in sdss and galex imaging .",
    "this source has the largest m@xmath3/l ratio in our sample , has an irregular h  i  morphology , and lacks clear signs of coherent rotation . given its location in the ngc3370 group , we conclude that this feature has a tidal origin .",
    "the gaseous and stellar components of agc226178 make it a very intriguing system .",
    "it is located within a projected separation of @xmath075 kpc from vcc2034 and vcc2037 , both of which are detected in our h  i  imaging .",
    "it is also in very close angular projection ( @xmath01 , or @xmath05 kpc at the adopted distance ) to agc229166 , a source with very low optical surface brightness that is not detected in h  i  by either alfalfa or the present observations or in the uv in galex imaging .",
    "surprisingly , these galex images reveal a significant uv flux from an irregular - morphology source that is coincident with the h  i  centroid of agc226178 .",
    "we interpret this source as the stellar counterpart of agc226178 and thus classify it as a dwarf galaxy .",
    "the nature of agc229166 , and its possible association with agc226178 , remains unclear with the present data .",
    "the remaining three sources in this study ( agc193953 , agc208399 , and agc233638 ) appear to be galaxies with higher than average m@xmath3/l ratios in comparison with those found in the samples of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . of these sources , agc193953 and agc208399",
    "are the most promising for more detailed investigation . with the highest m@xmath3/l ratios of the galaxies in this study , and very low uv - based star formation rates",
    ", these sources can facilitate an exploration of the star formation threshold in a sparsely - explored region of parameter space .",
    "agc233638 is a comparatively distant source with a lower mass to light ratio ; higher resolution observations of this source will be less valuable .    as of this writing",
    ", there are roughly 50 viable `` almost dark '' candidate sources in the alfalfa catalog .",
    "the present pilot study of five sources from this larger sample demonstrates the complexity of the members of this heterogenous class of objects : the higher angular resolution vla images localize the h  i  gas ( thereby facilitating an association with a stellar component for most of these objects ) and reveal ordered motions indicative of galaxy - like objects .",
    "the discovery potential of a dedicated follow - up observing campaign to study the gaseous components of all candidate `` almost dark '' systems is thus exceptionally high .",
    "our team is pursuing similar h  i  observations of the full `` almost dark '' sample , as well as deep optical images of the sources with large field - of - view instruments .",
    "for example , preliminary results from these initiatives demonstrate significant similarities between agc226178 ( studied here ) and agc229385 and its neighbors ( janowiecki etal .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "these future works hold significant promise for furthering our understanding of the evolution of extremely gas - rich systems .",
    "they will allow us to explore the nature of star formation in the high m@xmath3/l regime ; the preliminary results from the present work suggest a very inefficient or suppressed star formation process .",

    "<S> four of the sources with uncertain or no optical counterpart in the alfalfa data are identified with low surface brightness optical counterparts in sloan digital sky survey imaging when compared with vla h  i  intensity maps , and appear to be galaxies with clear signs of ordered rotation in the h  i  velocity fields . </S>",
    "<S> three of these are detected in far - ultraviolet galex images , a likely indication of star formation within the last few hundred myrs . </S>",
