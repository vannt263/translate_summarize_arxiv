    "the wall crossing formula given in the above theorem is analogous to the formula in boysal - vergne @xcite .",
    "this formula is also similar to wall crossing formulae in hamiltonian geometry for the push - forward of the liouville measure ; indeed , when crossing a wall , this piecewise polynomial measure changes according to the same scheme @xcite , @xcite .",
    "our wall crossing formula in theorem [ introthe ] is thus in accordance with the fact that for special cases @xmath8 computes the volume of the moduli spaces @xmath92 .",
    "these spaces can be described as symplectic reduction at @xmath29 of the jeffrey - kirwan extended moduli space @xmath93 , so that their volume at @xmath29 is given by the push - forward of the liouville measure on @xmath93 , a piecewise polynomial function periodic with respect to a lattice @xmath1 .",
    "recall that jeffrey - kirwan ( @xcite ) proved wall crossing formulae for integrals on moduli spaces @xmath94 , and used them in a fundamental way to compute intersection pairings on @xmath94 when @xmath95 .",
    "however , in the general situation that we are considering here , we do not have such a geometric interpretation of the multiple bernoulli series .    in section [ section : affine ]",
    "we generalize the above results to the case of affine arrangements .    in section [ section :",
    "decomp ] , we give a decomposition formula for @xmath8 , describing it as a superposition of ` basic pieces ' made of convolution products of lower dimensional bernoulli series and multisplines .",
    "more precisely , we say that @xmath96 is an admissible subspace of @xmath2 if @xmath96 is spanned by some elements of @xmath0 , and we say that @xmath97 is affine admissible , if @xmath97 is a translate by @xmath1 of an admissible subspace . given a tope @xmath70 , we express the difference between the * piecewise polynomial * density @xmath8 and the * polynomial * density @xmath98 as a sum of distributions @xmath99 associated to proper affine admissible subspaces @xmath97 and the choice of an element @xmath100 .",
    "the supports of these distributions do not intersect @xmath70 and are convolution products of polynomial distributions supported on @xmath97 with multisplines distributions directed towards the exterior of @xmath70 .",
    "our construction is inspired by the stratification of a hamiltonian manifold @xmath101 using the square of the moment map as morse function , and we will use a scalar product on @xmath2 .",
    "our decomposition formula is very similar to paradan s decomposition of the equivariant index of a twisted dirac operator on @xmath101 @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "paradan s decomposition was proved by combinatorial methods , and used to give a proof that quantization commutes with reduction for compact hamiltonian manifolds .",
    "we follow here very closely the line of approach of @xcite .",
    "however our superposition is an infinite ( but locally finite ) superposition .",
    "this is in accordance with the fact that for some special cases , our distributions are related to liouville measures of noncompact hamiltonian manifolds such as @xmath93 with infinite number of critical components for the square of the moment map .",
    "for example , the periodic polynomial @xmath102)/2 $ ] in figure  [ spline](a ) is decomposed in figure  [ spline](b ) as a superposition of a polynomial density with an infinite number of spline functions .",
