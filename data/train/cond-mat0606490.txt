    "in jila  experiments,@xcite,@xcite a mixture of two hyperfine states was found to segregate by species .",
    "the theoretical explanation@xcite-@xcite for this behavior is based on the two states playing the role of a pseudo - spin-1/2 system , having transverse spin waves .",
    "the theory of these new effects is based on old ideas of the transport properties of polarized homogeneous quantum gases of real spins , such as @xmath0he gas and solutions of @xmath1he in liquid @xmath2he,@xcite,@xcite transcribed to the trapped gas pseudo - spin case .",
    "besides spin waves , the theory for homogeneous polarized fermions or bosons led to the prediction of anisotropic spin diffusion in the degenerate state.@xcite,@xcite,@xcite when a spin nonuniformity is longitudinal , that is , with a variation in the magnitude of the magnetization , the spin diffusion coefficient is @xmath3 . on the other hand , in a spin - echo experiment",
    ", the magnitude of the magnetization is uniform but it varies spatially in direction . the corresponding diffusion coefficient",
    ", @xmath4 is less than @xmath3 when the system is polarized and degenerate .",
    "experimentally this feature has been seen , but was not always in reasonable accord with theory.@xcite further , fomin@xcite has suggested the effect should not exist .",
    "however , a recent experiment@xcite has overcome several possible experimental objections and finds good agreement with theory",
    ". moreover recent papers@xcite,@xcite have presented theoretical analyses that question the validity of fomin s approach .",
    "thus it seems useful to see whether a similar difference between longitudinal and transverse diffusion in trapped gases might provide an alternative testing ground for this question .",
    "however , what we show here is that the physical possibility of having differing interaction parameters between up - up , down - down , and up - down states ( interaction anisotropy ) provides a new physical basis for anisotropic spin diffusion for bosons even in the boltzmann limit.@xcite for longitudinal diffusion in the boltzmann limit only up - down scattering contributes .",
    "however , in the transverse case , two spins at differing angles approach one another , and the scattering can be analyzed as being a superposition of , say , up - up and up - down scattering . in the fermion s - wave case ,",
    "the up - up part gives no contribution , and , in the boltzmann limit , the diffusion coefficients are identical . in that case",
    "one must go to the degenerate limit to see the anisotropy , which then is expected to arise because the density of scattering states differs in longitudinal and transverse cases.@xcite on the other hand , for bosons , for which both the up - up and down - down scattering rates do contribute , we find an anisotropy even in the boltzmann limit , but only if the various scattering lengths differ .",
    "we have here the interesting effect that , although both gases obey boltzmann statistics , there is a macroscopic difference between fermion and boson behavior because of quantum statistical effects in the two - particle scattering .",
    "moreover in the bose case a new element enters : the interaction now introduces a spin - spin relaxation mechanism ( a @xmath5 process ) so that transverse magnetization is no longer conserved.@xcite for very small relaxation times @xmath6 , the hydrodynamic relaxation rate is no longer is linear in @xmath6 ; now it diverges . for fermions",
    "it remains well behaved .",
    "below we first use the moments method to compute the spectra of the lowest - lying longitudinal and transverse modes .",
    "however , with that method we obtain a transverse decay rate @xmath7 that diverges as @xmath8 approaches zero , in contrast to the usual diffusive behavior where @xmath9 . in this case",
    "it is necessary to solve the _ local _ hydrodynamic equations to find the correct behavior , in which the hydrodynamic solutions are localized at the low - density regions at the edges of the cloud where the collision time is longer .",
    "the result is a much smaller decay rate than that obtained with the moments method .    in helium",
    "the dipole modes were detected experimentally , but in the trapped gases it was more convenient to look at the quadrupole modes.@xcite , @xcite thus we calculate both here .",
    "we have previously reported results on the dipolar modes.@xcite    in our previous work , ref .  , we derived an analog of the landau - silin equation for a @xmath10 density operator @xmath11 ( here acting in the pseudo - spin space ) , with effective mean - field single particle energy matrix @xmath12 .",
