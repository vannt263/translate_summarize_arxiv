    "a polyelectrolyte ( pe ) is an ionic polymer which when dissolved in polar solvents dissociates into a long polymer chain ( macroion ) , and small mobile _ counterions_. because of the electrostatic repulsion of the uncompensated charges on the polymer , the chain is stretched out to rodlike conformations .",
    "naively , one may expect that higher charges on the polyelectrolyte lead to more rodlike configurations .",
    "this is not the case , as the tendency towards extended shapes is opposed by stronger attraction to the counterions .",
    "the latter may condense on a highly charged polyelectrolyte , giving it a much lower apparent charge@xcite , and resulting in a lower stiffness . nonetheless , in a mean - field ( poisson - boltzmann ) treatment of the counterions , the conformation of the polyelectrolyte is stretched@xcite .    on the other hand , it is now well known from experiments @xcite , simulations @xcite , and analytical theories @xcite , that highly charged flexible polyelectrolytes ( such as polystyrene sulphonate ) can collapse in the presence of multivalent counterions to highly compact states .",
    "stiff polyelectrolytes ( such as dna ) could also collapse @xcite , and rodlike polyelectrolytes may form bundles @xcite , under similar conditions . to account for these effects ,",
    "an attractive interaction capable of competing with the residual coulomb repulsion ( of the polyelectrolyte backbones with compensated charge densities ) is needed .",
    "note that the situation is more subtle for stiff polyelectrolytes due to their intrinsic rigidity @xcite .    to understand the origin of the attractive interaction , consider two like - charged substrates on which counterions are condensed .",
    "as the two objects approach each other , the counterions may rearrange their positions .",
    "any _ correlated separation of charges _ now leads to an _ attraction _ whose range is of the order of the `` correlation hole '' of the counterions on each substrate .",
    "several different mechanisms may lead to correlated charge separation : ( i ) at low temperatures , the counterions form a wigner crystal on the charged substrate , which leads to an attractive interaction with a range set by the lattice spacing @xcite .",
    "( ii ) specific binding of counterions to the substrate is another mechanism for charge separation @xcite . in this case",
    "the periodicity , and hence the range of the attraction , is dictated by the underlying structure of the substrate , such as the double helical structure of dna along which the charged phosphate groups are located .",
    "( iii ) thermal fluctuations can also induce instantaneous charge separations which inter - correlate on the two objects , leading to an attraction similar to the van der waals interaction .",
    "since the dominant fluctuations have wavelengths of the order of the separation of the objects , the range of the attraction is set by the distance between them ; i.e. the interaction is long - ranged @xcite .",
    "( iv ) finally , it has been proposed that macroions can be overcharged by the condensing counterions due to the gain in correlation energy @xcite .",
    "consequently , when two such macroions are brought close to each other in a neutralizing solution , the distribution of the counterions can be asymmetric leading , at each instant , to one overcharged and one undercharged macroion @xcite .",
    "this mechanism will lead to instantaneous ordinary long - ranged coulomb attraction between the two decorated macroions , and is reminiscent of covalent bonding in atomic systems in that the macroions are effectively sharing a fraction of their condensed counterions @xcite .",
    "as thermal fluctuations clearly set the energy scale for the relevance of these different attractive interactions , one may naturally ask the following question @xcite : is room temperature ` high ' or ` low ' for dna or actin condensation , or bundle formation ? in regards to this question one should note that although an actual wigner crystal may appear far  fetched on the surface of dna or actin at room temperature , remnants of such a structure may survive for multivalent counterions . since it is just the local charge separation that is needed for the ` zero temperature ' mechanism , and not the long - range order of the global structure , a liquid phase should still lead to attraction provided that some short - range order persists .",
    "consequently , it seems that both types of interactions are in effect at room temperature and the dominant mechanism should be determined by comparing the range of the interaction and the distance between macroions . while the short - ranged interactions seem to play the dominant role in bundle formation @xcite , there seems to be a consensus that they are not capable of actually collapsing a single dna or actin chain @xcite , and thus the long - ranged interaction caused by thermal fluctuations may be responsible for the observed condensation@xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the long wavelength behavior of polyelectrolytes .",
    "our approach is complementary to that of the `` wigner liquid '' theories  @xcite , whose local formulation corresponds to examination of short wavelength behavior .",
    "they find that the softening contribution to the persistence length due to the wigner liquid correlations is not large enough to fully compensate the mechanical stiffness and render a null persistence length , which would trigger chain collapse .",
    "we also find that the softening contribution to the rigidity due to charge fluctuations at the smallest length - scales is never strong enough to completely negate the bare bending rigidity , and obtain collapse _ at these scales _ , but rather that the ` collapse ' occurs at higher length - scales due to _ longer _ wavelength charge fluctuations .",
    "additional correlations at short length - scales as might be obtained with a wigner liquid should not affect the large - scale behavior which is the domain of our theory .    to this end , we employ path integral methods@xcite to study the energy cost of deforming a stiff and highly charged polyelectrolyte in the presence of thermally fluctuating counterions @xcite . in particular , consider a chain of length @xmath0 , with a microscopic persistence length @xmath1 , and average separation @xmath2 between charges on its backbone , in a neutralizing solution of counterions of valence @xmath3 .",
    "the polyelectrolyte is considered highly charged when @xmath2 is less than the bjerrum length @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the dielectric constant of the solvent .",

    "the linear stability of this structure is controlled by a spectrum @xmath7 , as a function of the deformation wave vector @xmath8 .",
    "a negative value of @xmath9 signals an instability at the corresponding wavelength , leading to phase diagrams as in figs .",

    "the above expression , which is a _ non - trivial _ generalization of the odijk - skolnick - fixman ( osf ) electrostatic persistence length @xcite , is a sum of repulsive ( + ) and attractive ( - ) electrostatic contributions",

    "we also find that the onset of conformational instability is a re - entrant phenomenon as a function of polyelectrolyte length for the unscreened case , and the debye length or salt concentration for the screened case .",
    "this may be relevant in understanding the re - entrant condensation of dna that has been observed experimentally @xcite , but note that alternative explanations for this phenomenon also exist in the literature @xcite .",

    "this is in agreement with the generalised effective persistence length given in eq .",
    "( [ lpeff ] ) .",
    "there may be of course , other contributions to the effective persistence length coming from other types of charge correlations .",
    "flexible polyelectrolytes have also been shown to collapse in the presence of divalent ions  @xcite .",

    "this is in agreement with the results we obtained in the salt - free regime .",
    "we now conclude with a qualitative summary of the nature of the results , and the range of their validity . from dimensional analysis ,",
    "it is easy to show that _ unscreened _ coulomb interactions make a contribution of @xmath93 to the rigidity spectrum @xmath9 . in the pb solution ,",
    "due to charge condensation the strength of this term is reduced by a factor of @xmath94 . if the charge density on the polyelectrolyte is allowed to fluctuate , it is further reduced , and the coulomb rigidity goes down by a factor of @xmath95 , with @xmath96 .",
    "however , these reductions do not change the overall sign which still prefers a rodlike structure .",
    "an attractive ( destabilizing ) contribution is generated by fluctuation - induced interactions , which are typically independent of microscopic parameters , and hence make a contribution of @xmath97 to @xmath9 . in comparison to the leading coulomb contribution , the latter corrections become important at _ short scales _ of order of @xmath98 .",
    "we thus may well question the applicability of continuum formulations to describe such a short - distance instability .",
    "in hindsight , the phase diagrams of fig .  2 and fig .  3",
    "indicate that the prefactors involved in softening of the residual repulsion conspire to make the actual instability lengths quite large ( @xmath99 ) , and thus the continuum formulation should hold for a large portion of these phase diagrams @xcite .",
    "another potential concern is the choice of the charge variance @xmath100 .",
    "while our approach ignores the finite size of the counterions and allows for a large number of them to be condensed in the vicinity of a single charged group on the polyelectrolyte , there are other models that have restricted this number to one @xcite . given the relatively large radius of dna and actin as compared to the size of typical counterions , the restriction of this number to one seems to be artificial , as it leads erroneously to zero charge fluctuations at complete condensation .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that considering the finite size of the counterions in a realistic way will certainly be a worthwhile improvement of our approach . finally , the instability analysis performed here only provides us with information concerning the onset of a conformational change .",
    "the final structure of the collapsed chain is naturally beyond this linear stability analysis@xcite .",
    "it is known experimentally that different counterions with the same valence may behave differently as collapsing agents .",
    "the difference is usually attributed to modifications in the microscopic structure of the polyelectrolyte that take place upon binding of the counterions@xcite .",
    "it is thus plausible that the microscopic features that distinguish between different counterions with the same electrostatic properties can be encoded in a single parameter , the microscopic persistence length , which normally depends only on the local microscopic structure of the polyelectrolyte backbone .",
