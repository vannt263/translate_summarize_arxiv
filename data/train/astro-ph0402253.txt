    "the metric used here is the usual schwarzschild metric , @xmath1 the time - independent gravitational field equations reduces to : @xmath2 the mixed energy - momentum tensor will include the terms of the electromagnetic field , giving us an equation of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 the mass density and @xmath6 the radial electric field .",
    "the four - divergence of @xmath7 should vanish for it being a conserved quantity and so we get @xmath8 this is the tolman - oppeheimer - volkoff ( tov ) equation for a spherically symmetric charged fluid .",
    "this equation represents the hydrostatic equilibrium for the fluid .",
    "the first term of the right hand side ( r.h.s . ) of equation ( [ eq : dp ] ) is derived from the normal matter - energy , but the second term is new .",
    "it represents the contribution from the coulombian force and the energy from the electric field .",
    "if we look at the energy - momentum tensor ( equation ( [ emt ] ) ) , we see that the effective pressure and density in the fluid is given for @xmath9    now the energy - momentum tensor takes the following form : @xmath10    we could have written the last two terms as function of the effective pressure and density , but we did nt because it is not advantageous .",
    "now we have the modified tov equation : @xmath11",
    "we have from the exterior schwarzschild solution that @xmath12 usually we would have only the first term ( of the mass ) but here the total mass that an observer really see must include the contribution of the energy from the electric field .",
    "this one is not limited to the surface of the stars and is observed by a distant observer , so we have to include the contribution of the electric energy seen from infinity .",
    "so we can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the charge density . now we can define an effective mass given by @xmath15 with the help of the equations ( [ enu ] ) and ( [ mef1 ] ) we define @xmath16 as @xmath17 with this we rewrite @xmath18 in the following form : @xmath19 writing equation ( [ fe1 ] ) as function of @xmath16 and using equation ( [ ex ] ) we get the following relation : @xmath20 now we have to write the explicit relation between effective pressure and effective density , then use in the modified tov equation ( [ tovm ] ) .",
    "we will assume that this relation is given by the following polytropic equation : @xmath21 if we do a dimensional analysis we will see that all terms of the r.h.s",
    ". have the dimension of pressure divided by unit of length , which is not surprising since the left hand side is a derivative of the pressure with respect to the radius . in this sense",
    "we will call the second term of the r.h.s . in the following form : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a pressure related to the electric field . and in order to make further progress we will suppose that this pressure also obeys a polytropic equation of state @xmath24 now let us write the density in a parametric form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the central effective pressure and @xmath27 is the central electric pressure .",
    "in this notation , both electric and effective pressure take the form @xmath28 using these modifications on equation ( [ tovm ] ) we get @xmath29 where @xmath30 integrating equation ( [ tetanu ] ) and using the fact that @xmath31 when @xmath32 we get @xmath33            these are the general lane - emden equation for a spherically symmetric charged polytropic fluid . solving these equation",
    "we can step back and find those variables of our interest .",
    "numerical solution and verification of these equations with the results obtained by solving the tov in the _ normal _ procedure is beyond the scope of this present paper and will be shown in a future article ."
