    "since the discovery of the electron as a negatively charged sub - atomic particle by thomson  @xcite , its spin by uhlenbeck and goudsmit  @xcite , and its wave nature by de broglie  @xcite , we have always imagined ( in one way or another ) of their interactions and motion within a given atom or an electronic device , and how their wavefunctions transform in order to flow along the grid and through the lattice points , satisfying the principle of least action  @xcite ( when the system is away from the critical point ) and the principle of maximum interaction  @xcite during a phase transition .",
    "this single thought have led us to formulate the proper and consistent theories to understand fermi liquid metals , semiconductors , band insulators , conventional superconductors , magnets , ferromagnets , ferroelectrics and the mott - hubbard insulators  @xcite .",
    "apart from the high temperature superconductors  @xcite and strange metals  @xcite , topological insulators  @xcite , and quantum hall metals  @xcite are the other major solid - state systems that currently need proper formulations to understand their electronic properties , regardless whether these systems have the potential for future technological marvels .    here",
    ", we will derive the trial hall resistance formula that will capture the essential physics required to understand the constant hall resistances for certain filling factors and the magnetic - field dependent part of the hall resistance due to the finite longitudinal resistance along the applied electric fields . the physical mechanisms invoked to formulate the hall resistance formula involve the usual metallic fermi liquid where the degenerate landau levels ( lls ) are crossed , and at each point of this ll crossing",
    ", there exists a finite but irrelevant energy - level spacing , which is responsible for the nonzero longitudinal resistance along the applied electric fields with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "the above energy - level spacings are called irrelevant because they do not require the wavefunction transformation beyond the phase factor , otherwise , these spacings are known as the `` relevant '' energy - level spacings , which have been proven elsewhere  @xcite .    anyway , these irrelevant ll spacings do not play any role for certain ll crossings , hence can be taken to be zero symbolically for convenience .",
    "the system s lls split due to zeeman splitting , and with increasing magnetic field strength , these levels cross each other in a complicated way ( within the degenerate lls ) , which can be used to postulate two independent physical processes .",
    "the first physical mechanism is influenced by this irrelevant ll spacings such the electron - flow requires large changes to the phase factor and group momentum of a wavefunction , while the other mechanism for electron - flow is independent of these spacings ( require small changes to the phase factor , or negligible changes to the group momentum of a wavefunction ) .",
    "here , we will further elaborate on these two processes , and make use of them to derive and discuss the hall resistance in quantum hall metals for both fractional and integer filling factors .",
    "we start with these open sets , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are allowed to overlap such that @xmath2 and @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a complex @xmath5-dimensional topological space and an @xmath5-dimensional differential manifold that deals with complex ( @xmath6 ) numbers .",
    "we also define a transition function , @xmath7 , \\label{eq:1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] that smoothly maps @xmath0 to @xmath1 , following definition 5.1 and theorem 10.2 given by nakahara in ref .",
    "@xcite where i = @xmath8 , @xmath9 , an arbitrary function that will be defined later as the pancharatnam - berry phase , and @xmath10 refers to the same coordinate point on both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "physically , we can define @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the wave vector in momentum space , @xmath14 denotes the wave number , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( excluding zero ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the electron wavefunctions in the valence and conduction energy bands , respectively , and therefore @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the principal quantum numbers such that @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 implies the energy gap , @xmath23 and therefore , @xmath24 . if @xmath25 , then @xmath26 and consequently @xmath27 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) does not exist because @xmath27 strictly requires zero energy gap , and accordingly , we now define the respective pancharatnam - berry ( pb ) connection and pb curvature  @xcite , @xmath28 @xmath29 here @xmath30 = @xmath31{\\rm d}\\texttt{x}$ ] ( @xmath32 here can be any variable ) and @xmath33 denotes the exterior product , whereas @xmath30 and d are the exterior derivatives",
    ". we now drop @xmath10 for convenience , which will become clear shortly .",
    "furthermore , the component of a pb connection is given by @xmath34$]d@xmath35 where @xmath36 .",
    "the origin of berry s phase  @xcite has been proven earlier by pancharatnam using the elliptically - polarized pencil beams within the poincar@xmath37 sphere  @xcite , such that , the berry s phase is a rediscovered special case ( with a constant group momentum ) within the pancharatnam s wavefunction transformation , which has been proven in ref .",

    "( [ eq:21 ] ) is exactly the conductance derived by kohmoto in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath20 is the @xmath85 conduction band . however , the origin of the negative sign that appears in eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) has got nothing to do with the negative sign in the kohmoto conductance formula , @xmath86 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which , the source of the negative sign in @xmath86 is i@xmath87 .",
    "in fact , we can reversibly switch the sign ( @xmath88 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eq:20 ] ) , such that , the positive sign is for @xmath46 , while @xmath89 implies a negative conductance , or vice versa , which then , can be defined to be related to a hole- or an electron - conduction .",
    "this reversible sign - switch is also compatible with @xmath86 given in ref .",
    "@xcite if one were to use the chern winding number in the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) .    in summary , we have provided an alternative derivation to obtain the integer hall conductance by explicitly invoking the definition for hall conductance ( @xmath90 ) , the pb phase ( @xmath91 ) and the first chern winding number ( @xmath92 )",
    ". you should be aware here that eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) is valid for a two - dimensional ( 2d ) fermi gas or fermi liquid metals such that @xmath23 , and this means that the fermi - dirac probability always equals one such that an electron can readily occupy an empty energy level at the fermi surface without any energy penalty .",
    "the chern winding number introduced above actually refers to a winding fibre  @xcite , a mathematical notion that has got nothing to do with any physical entity nor refers to an electron s energy level and this fibre does not represent the electronic wavefunction .",
    "for example , in the presence of external magnetic fields , @xmath72 does not count the number of complete circles ( multiple of 2@xmath93 ) made by an electron ( or a hole ) during the hall transport .",
    "this means that , a particular wavefunction picks up a phase factor ( given in eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) on the right - hand side of a wavefunction ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq:10a ] ) ) , not because of the right - hand action operator ( defined in section 10.1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but due to a physical notion , known as the pancharatnam phase retardation  @xcite .",
    "this phase retardation originates from the interaction between an electron and the vector potential giving rise to the changing phase and/or group momenta  @xcite .",
    "rightly so , @xmath72 has been replaced by the laughlin - jain filling factor , @xmath94 worked out by laughlin by means of the trial - wavefunction approach  @xcite and jain  @xcite such that @xmath94 does not have to be an integer due to the interaction between charge carriers and the magnetic fields , @xmath95 where @xmath96 is a vector potential . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) reads , @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , according to jain  @xcite , the integer @xmath94 refers to composite fermions",
    ". the readers can refer to an excellent review by murthy and shankar  @xcite on quantum hall effects for @xmath98 within the extended hamiltonian theories .",
    "there is also an alternative interpretation due to wilczek  @xcite where the fractional @xmath94 is proposed to arise from the exotic particles called anyons .",
    "however , the game now has changed due to the rediscovery of pancharatnam s phase retardation notion  @xcite , in such a way that one can substitute @xmath72 with @xmath99 that will capture the changes in the phase and group momenta of the electrons , in the presence of ( i ) @xmath100 and ( ii ) irrelevant and finite energy - level spacings .",
    "we will see why this is so shortly .",
    "we first show why the irrelevant energy - level spacing , @xmath101 , exists even in the presence of crossed energy levels such that the band and mott - hubbard energy gaps are zero . in this case",
    ", the electrons still satisfy the metallic fermi liquid theory in the usual sense . for the free - electron metals , @xmath102 , and on the other hand ,",
    "one obtains a strange metal if @xmath103 is a relevant parameter  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath103 is zero or irrelevant , one can define the wavefunction as a plane wave because @xmath13 is `` energetically '' continuous ( @xmath104 or the fermi surface is continuous ) throughout the momentum space , even within the so - called conduction band ( with @xmath26 ) or the overlapped band ( with @xmath23 ) .",
    "this means that , even when @xmath105 , there is no energy gap for an electron to occupy the landau level , @xmath106 from its initial level , @xmath107 , hence the label , irrelevant in @xmath101 ( see the discussion below ) .",
    "having said that , @xmath101 can be formally shown to exist from refs .",

    "in particular , @xmath113 denotes the non - interacting hamiltonian and @xmath114 is the interaction operator .",
    "the landau energy levels , @xmath115 at a certain @xmath13 point ( @xmath116 ) does not imply @xmath117 even though @xmath118 because @xmath119 and @xmath120 . these not - equal signs and @xmath121 mean that the landau levels are degenerate and @xmath122 where @xmath101 is the averaged irrelevant ll spacing .",
    "if @xmath123 , then the only required wavefunction transformation refers to picking up or dropping the pb phase factor ( eq .  ( [ eq:14 ] ) ) such that , the phase and group momenta , as well as the degenerate landau levels ( and the filling factor , @xmath99 ) change with increasing or decreasing magnetic fields . here",
    ", the changes to the pb phase factor is large ( because the electron - flow involves many lls ) such that there is a large change in the group momentum of a wavefunction . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath124 restricts the wavefunction to pick up or drop the same pb phase factor within the same landau level where the new filling factor , @xmath99 is a constant , even when @xmath125 changes . in this case",
    "however , the changes to the pb phase factor require a small change in the group momentum of a wavefunction ( because the electron - flow involves only one ll ) .    as a consequence ,",
    "the hall resistance consists of two independent physical processes , which are activated when @xmath126 increases where changing @xmath126 initiates the changes to the landau level crossings and zeeman splittings , in such a way that there are two possibilities(i ) for a certain set of crossed landau levels ( within the degenerate lls ) , one requires the electrons to flow within the same landau levels ( where @xmath99 remains unchanged ) governed by eq .",
    "( [ eq:21 ] ) . on the other hand , ( ii )",
    "the second process is also activated for a different set of landau level crossings where they now require the electrons to flow from one landau level to another degenerate landau level that gives @xmath127 . in this latter case",
    ", @xmath99 is not a constant .",
    "therefore , the total hall resistance for quantum hall metals can be constructed to read ( we can suppress the negative sign for an obvious reason ) , @xmath128^{\\rm same}_{\\rm ll,~\\xi_{\\rm irr } = 0 } + \\alpha_b\\sum_r\\bigg[\\frac{{\\rm d}r_{\\bot}}{{\\rm d}b}\\bigg]_rb\\bigg|^{\\rm many}_{\\rm lls,~\\xi_{\\rm irr } \\neq 0}. \\label{eq:26}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the magnitude of applied magnetic fields is denoted by @xmath125 , @xmath129 is a numerical constant of proportionality due to applied magnetic fields , and recall that @xmath130 is not literally true , but a symbolic way of saying that only one particular ll contributes to @xmath131 ( by means of the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) ) , which eventually means , @xmath132 does not play any role . in particular , the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) is independent of @xmath126 ( because @xmath133 ) , and comes from the resistance due to electron - flow in the same landau level ( ll ) , labeled @xmath134 .",
    "whereas , the second term arises from the electron - flow involving many lls within the degenerate lls , labeled @xmath135 , which is proportional to the change in the longitudinal resistance ( @xmath136 ) along the applied electric fields , perpendicular to @xmath131 .",
    "for example , @xmath137 because @xmath136 is not entirely due to applied electric fields if @xmath100 where @xmath138 can be nonlinear . besides that , whenever @xmath139 , @xmath133 where @xmath140 represent the electron s path with many @xmath99 ( due to many lls or many quantitatively different wavefunctions are involved ) , while @xmath134 requires a constant @xmath99 ( due to a single ll or only an identical wavefunction is involved ) .",
    "apparently , `` quantitatively different wavefunctions '' here means that they are orthonormalized , satisfying eqs .",

    "[ fig:1 ] , we used eq .",
    "( [ eq:26 ] ) to plot the zigzag hall resistance curve by approximating @xmath141 @xmath142slope and @xmath143 where the extra factor , the one - half that appears in the stated equality implies that we can approximately and correctly consider only the part where @xmath136 increases with increasing @xmath125 , which then contributes to the total @xmath131 .",
    "we have made use of the connection between the pancharatnam phase retardation ( changing phase and/or group momenta ) and @xmath131 via @xmath99 , @xmath130 and @xmath132 to construct eq .",
