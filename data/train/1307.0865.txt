    "such extremely young protostars , though their total number would be small because of their short time scale , have most probably not been identified in many previous studies . in order for us to study the initial conditions , or extremely early phase of star formation , it is crucial for us to pay more attention to starless cores , where no bright infrared sources are found .",
    "starless cores with high central densities are sometimes called pre - stellar cores , as they show signs of evolution toward the formation of a protostar , such as inward motions ( e.g. , ; tafalla et al 1998 . ohashi et al .",

    "furthermore , the reflection nebula indicates a wide opening angle cavity , hence it is expected that both blue and redshifted co emission appears in both outflow lobes . the observed co ( 21 )",
    "emission shows more complicated structures than the reflection nebula . the blueshifted co emission is brighter on the eastern side , which is in the opposite sense to what might be expected from the reflection nebula image",
    "this may be a consequence of the non - uniform distribution of the surrounding material .",
    "the absence of the redshifted emission can be explained by the absorption from foreground diffuse gas , as mentioned in section 3.3 .",

    "three emission peaks surrounding the protostar are detected .",
    "no significant emission ( @xmath48 ) was detected close to the systemic velocity of .",
    "this is most likely due to the lack of sensitivity to large - scale structures , mainly originated from extended emission such as an ambient envelope , although , as will be discussed in section 3.3 , missing flux originated from the outflow is less likely significant .",
    "in addition , self - absorption of the co emission would also responsible for the less significant emission at @xmath49=6.67.7 km s@xmath2 ( see more detail in section 3.3 ) .",

    "the most redshifted components in the velocity range of the are detected west of the protostar position .",
    "the co emission is elongated in an east - west direction , which is consistent with the extension of the near - infrared nebula observed in the image .",
    "hence , it is likely that the co emission trace the outflow . in fact , the observed mean co velocity , @xmath42 km s@xmath2 , is significantly larger than the velocity required to escape from the typical stellar mass in taurus ( 0.8 m@xmath1 ; luhman et al .",
    "2009 at 1000 au , which is @xmath40.7 km s@xmath2 ) . moreover , if the co emission is associated with the near - infrared nebula , the intrinsic co velocity should be larger than the observed co velocity .",

    "2009 ; pole - on is defined as an outflow inclination angle of 0@xmath25 ) , velocities larger by factors of 2.9 and 1.6 would be expected .",
    "this argument suggests that the co emission is most likely gravitationally unbound .",
    "recent pdbi observations by maury et al .",
    "( 2010 ) did not detect the high velocity co ( 21 ) components .",
    "this suggests that the high velocity co is relatively extended , but not compact enough to be detected with the pdbi observations weighted toward the long baseline lengths .      in order to discuss the outflow properties ,",
    "we focus on the compact co outflow components detected with the sma . the nature of any extended outflow component is unclear and requires combining the sma data with single - dish data to recover extended missing flux .",
    "a full analysis of these data are beyond the scope of this paper , and we note that no high - velocity and extended outflow emission has been reported previously . in this paper , we investigate the missing flux using sma spectra compared with recently observed single - dish spectra using the submillimeter telescope ( smt ; ohashi et al .  in prep . ) .",
    "figure 4 presents a comparison of the sma and smt co spectra at the phase center .",
    "for the spectral comparison , the sma co data have been convolved with a smt beam , and both the sma and smt spectra are compared in units of brightness temperature . compares the spectra between the smt and sma . in order to compare the high - velocity co component originated from the outflow ,",
    "a `` residual '' spectrum was derived from the difference between the smt spectrum at the protostar position and a mean spectrum of the spectra at 30@xmath27 offsets from the central position ( thin line ) . here , we assume that the co ( 21 ) emission originating from the molecular outflow is dominant within @xmath502000 au ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "this assumption is probably reasonable because no large - scale molecular outflow has been reported from any previous single - dish studies .",
    "further , the detection of higher transition co ( 76 and 65 ) emission , which may originate in the shocked gas between the outflow and dense envelope gas , also shows a similar size ( shinnaga et al .",
    "2009 ) . with this reasoning",
    ", the emission at positions offset from the protostar mostly comes from emission in the protostellar envelope .",
    "subtraction of the mean spectrum of the offset positions from the central spectrum is presented in figure 4b as thin line .",

    "two intensity peaks were detected with the lsr velocity at and .",
    "these velocity peaks are shifted from the cloud systemic velocities , . the co spectrum taken with the smt",
    "is poorly fitted by a single - gaussian component centered at the systemic velocity of cloud , .",
    "one possibility to explain this is the presence of a secondary component located along the same line of sight with a different systemic velocities .",
    "the line profile with a peak velocity of is only detected in the lower transitions of co ( 10 and 21 ; our smt data presented in figure 4a ) and @xmath19co ( 10 ) ( takakuwa et al .",

    "2006 ; shinnaga et al .",
    "if the secondary component ( diffuse cloud ) is located in the foreground of the main cloud , and if the temperature of the second cloud is colder than the main cloud , it is possible that co emission from the system is absorbed by the co emission of the second cloud .",
    "note that this idea also explains the missing redshifted emission seen in the sma spectrum with a velocity range of 6.5 to ( thick line ) , as well as the sharp decrease in emission in the redshifted velocity component observed in the position - velocity ( p - v ) diagram presented in ( will be discussed in ) .",
    "this sharp emission decrease is likely due to the self - absorption rather than missing flux in the sma observations .",
    "if the lack of emission is due to the missing short baselines , we should see the missing flux symmetrically centered at the systematic velocity .",
    "previous outflow studies favor two different models for the origin of outflows ( e.g. , lee et al .",

    "note that redshifted emission with the lsr velocity range between 6.5 to 8.0 km s@xmath2 was missed due to the foreground absorption , so that in the velocity analysis , we mainly focus on the blueshifted emission .",
    "the outflow shell was delineated following the blueshifted component of the co intensity map obtained with the sma and the _ spitzer _ 4.5 @xmath38 m image in order to determine the free parameter @xmath56 ( figure 2a and 2b ) .",

    "the l1521f outflow also does not show the large - velocity dispersion at the jet head , which is expected in the jet - driven outflow .",

    "<S> studying the physical conditions of very low - luminosity objects ( vellos ; @xmath0 l@xmath1 ) is important for understanding the earliest evolutionary stage of protostars and brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we report interferometric observations of the vello l1521f - irs , in line emission and the continuum emission , using the submillimeter array . with the high - resolution observations , </S>",
    "<S> we have spatially resolved a compact but poorly collimated molecular outflow associated with for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> the blueshifted and redshifted lobes are aligned along the east and west side of with a lobe size of . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated outflow mass , maximum outflow velocity , and outflow force are , 7.2 km s@xmath2 , and , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the estimated outflow parameters such as size , mass , and momentum rate are similar to values derived for other vellos , and are located at the lower end of values compared to previously studied outflows associated with low- to high - mass star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> low - velocity less collimated ( 1.5 km s@xmath2/1200 au ) and higher - velocity compact ( 4.0 km s@xmath2/920 au ) outflow components are suggested by the data </S>",
    "<S> . these velocity structures are not consistent with those expected in the jet driven or wind driven outflow models , perhaps suggesting a remnant outflow from the fhsc as well as an undeveloped outflow from the protostar . </S>",
    "<S> detection of an infrared source and compact millimeter continuum emission suggest the presence of the protostar , while its low bolometric luminosity ( 0.0340.07 l@xmath1 ) , and small outflow , suggests that l1521f is in the earliest protostellar stage ( @xmath3 yr ) and contains a substellar mass object . </S>",
    "<S> the bolometric ( or internal ) luminosity of l1521f - irs suggests that the current mass accretion rate is an order - of - magnitude lower than expected in the standard mass accretion model ( @xmath410@xmath5 m@xmath1 yr@xmath2 ) , which may imply that l1521f - irs is currently in a low activity phase . </S>"
