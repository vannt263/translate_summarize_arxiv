    ", cao proved the long time existence of the flow in any khler class proportional to the canonical class , and proved convergence in the case of non - positive first chern class . in the case of positive first chern class ,",
    "the khler - ricci flow in the anti - canonical class @xmath24 takes the normalized form as in ( [ kahler - ricci flow ] ) with the complex structure fixed . in this case",
    "the flow does not necessarily converge to a khler - einstein metric , due to the obstructions to the existence of khler - einstein metrics on fano manifolds . in an unpublished paper ,",
    "perelman proved that the scalar curvature and diameter are always uniformly bounded along the khler - ricci flow , and he announced that if there exists a khler - einstein metric , then the flow starting from any khler metric in the anti - canonical class of the same complex structure converges to a khler - einstein metric(note this was previously proved by chen - tian(@xcite ) when the initial metric is assumed to have positive bisectional curvature ) . in @xcite , using perelman s estimates , an alternative proof of this convergence was given .",
    "the case we consider is a stability type theorem : the khler - ricci flow initiating from a khler metric near a khler - einstein metric(possibly with a different complex structure ) always converges(modulo diffeomorphisms ) polynomially fast to a khler - einstein metric . using the gradient interpretation of ricci flow by perelman(@xcite ) , tian - zhu(@xcite )",
    "previously proved such a stability theorem when the khler - einstein metric is assumed to be isolated .",

    "note the gauging diffeomorphisms must diverge , if there is no khler - einstein metric compatible with the complex structure @xmath21 .",

    "are @xmath27-invariant , and thus live on @xmath29 . then on this quotient ,",
    "the ricci flow in the normalized form as in ( [ kahler - ricci flow ] ) is exactly the gradient flow of the @xmath28 functional .",

    "the limit is also a local maximum , but possibly be different from the one we start with if there is a non - trivial moduli .",
    "note in the case when the maximum is non - degenerate in the sense of morse - bott , then indeed we have exponential convergence .",
    "but if the maximum is degenerate , then we can not expect exponential convergence , and the rate of convergence depends on how bad the degeneracy is . for more details about the finite dimensional setting ,",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite .",
