    "_ ab initio _ calculations for solids",
    "are mostly performed nowadays formally within a one - particle picture using density - functional theory ( dft ) , i.e.describing the non - local exchange together with many - particle correlation effects within the local - density approximation ( lda)@xcite or within more sophisticated generalized - gradient approximations ( gga)@xcite . as an alternative , it is possible at the one - particle level to calculate the non - local exchange of a solid exactly , using a periodic hartree - fock ( hf ) scheme@xcite .",
    "+ however , for a proper microscopic treatment of electron correlations it is necessary to go beyond the one - particle framework and to deal with many - body wave functions . in the case of finite systems ,",
    "accurate quantum - chemical methods , of the configuration interaction ( ci ) or coupled - cluster ( cc ) type , have been developed for the determination of many - body wave functions and the corresponding correlation energies . in the case of solids ,",
    "the latter methods are not directly applicable , but it is often possible , to a very good approximation , to cast the correlation energy of the infinite system into a rapidly converging expansion in terms of increments from localized orbital subsystems@xcite . due to the local character of the correlation hole these increments may be determined for finite fragments of the solid and , as a consequence , the correlation energy of the solid becomes accessible to a quantum - chemical treatment . + the method of local increments has been applied to elementary@xcite and iii - v semiconductors@xcite , with an expansion in terms of correlation contributions related to localized bond orbitals and to pairs and triples of such bonds . on the other hand ,",
    "the same method has also successfully been used for ionic compounds such as mgo , cao , and nio@xcite ; there , the local increments refer to groups of atomic orbitals which can be assigned to given anionic or cationic centers . in an attempt to bridge the gap between covalent and ionic solids we now investigate the use of incremental schemes for correlation effects in ii - vi semiconductors . + in section ii ,",
    "we present the results of hartree - fock self - consistent field ( scf ) calculations for the solids just mentioned .",
    "the inclusion of correlations is discussed in section iii ; we first focus on the various correlation effects which have to be considered , and then elaborate on embedding procedures and the computational details of the method .",
    "results follow in section iv .",
    "finally , pertinent conclusions are given in section v.",
    "a starting point for treating many - body correlation effects in solids are reliable hartree - fock self - consistent field results for the infinite system .",
    "we performed hf ground - state calculations for six ii - vi semiconductors , i.e. , zns , znse and znte and the corresponding cd compounds in the zinc - blende structure , using the program package crystal92@xcite .",
    "+ the large number of electrons and the relativistic effects occurring in these materials can efficiently be handled by means of pseudopotentials .",
    "for the group vi elements we use the scalar - relativistic energy - consistent pseudopotentials of bergner et al . , together with the corresponding @xmath3 $ ] atomic valence basis sets@xcite . for their application in the crystal calculations the basis sets have to be modified , however : very diffuse exponents which are necessary to properly describe the tails of the free - atom wavefunctions cause numerical problems in crystal . in the solid the basis functions of neighbouring atoms take over their role due to close - packing",
    ". therefore we leave out the most diffuse @xmath4 exponent and use a reduced atomic @xmath5 $ ] basis set supplemented by a @xmath6 polarization function , which has been optimized for the zn - compounds in the solid ( @xmath7=0.45 , @xmath8=0.35 , @xmath9=0.25 ) . + for the group iib elements zn and cd we use two different sets of pseudopotentials : first 20-valence - electron pseudopotentials , where the outer - core @xmath10 shell and the corresponding @xmath11 shells are explicitly treated together with the @xmath12 valence electrons@xcite . again , optimized @xmath13 $ ] basis sets are available ( which we use for the calculation of the free atoms ) , but a reoptimization is needed for the solid . leaving out the most diffuse @xmath14 and @xmath4 exponents of the atomic basis sets ( for cd the outer @xmath6 exponent , too ) , we determined , for each angular momentum independently , the smallest exponent which still leads to a stable solution in the crystal calculation . starting with these ( fixed ) outer exponents we reoptimized the inner ones yielding @xmath15 or @xmath16 $ ] basis sets ( see table [ basis ] ) .",
    "+ furthermore , we use large - core 2-valence electron pseudopotentials for zn @xcite(see table [ pp ] ) and cd @xcite ( which will also be used at the correlated level , cf .",
    "sect .  3 ) .",
    ".[pp]the zn 2-valence - elelctron pseudopotential is represented in the semilocal form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the projection operator onto the hilbert subspace of angular symmetry @xmath19 .",
    "the exponents @xmath20 and the coefficients @xmath21 are listed below . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath22 reference [ ] + @xmath23 reference [ ]    the influence of the valence correlations , which are calculated at five points around the experimental lattice constant , is much smaller . with basis",
    "a , they reduce the bulk moduli of the zn - compounds by about 4% . for the cd - compounds the reduction is below 1% with basis a ;",
    "for cdte , where we also applied basis b , there is an reduction of about 4% .",
    "overall , the calculated bulk moduli are about 10% too large compared with mean experimental values .",
    "the error bars in our calculations can be roughly estimated to @xmath247% , all in all ; if we define experimental error bars through the spread of the various experimental values , they are of the same order of magnitude as our theoretical ones .",
    "lda calculations reach the same level of accuracy .",
    "the advantage of our approach is that we can discuss the influence of various electron - correlation effects on the lattice constant and the bulk modulus at a microscopic level .",
    "we have determined ground - state properties ( cohesive energies , lattice constants , bulk moduli ) of six ii - vi semiconductors , at various theoretical levels .",
    "the hartree - fock results have been obtained using the solid - state program crystal92 , explicitly treating the outer - core @xmath6 shell of zn and cd with small - core pseudopotentials and crystal - optimized basis sets . for the cohesive energies",
    ", we recover between 60% and 70% of the experimental values .",
    "the lattice constants are overestimated by up to 4.5% and the bulk moduli , evaluated at the experimental lattice constants , are too large .",
    "accounting for core - valence correlations by means of core - polarization potentials has only a slight influence on cohesive energies but yields a large reduction of the lattice constants and the bulk moduli .",
    "correlations of the valence electrons are determined with the help of an incremental expansion in terms of localized bonds , and pairs and triples of such bonds ; individual increments are evaluated at the coupled - cluster ( ccsd ) level , for fragments of the solid in a point - charge embedding .",
    "including valence correlations , we reach 85% of the correlation contributions to the cohesive energies , or @xmath2 95% of the total experimental values .",
    "valence correlations reduce the lattice constants only slightly , leading to final values within 1% of the experimental data ; there is also moderate decrease of the bulk moduli .",
    "+ the present calculations show that a reliable microscopic description of electron - correlation effects in ii - vi semiconductors can be obtained in terms of local excitations , and that a unified treatment ( with uniform accuracy ) is possible this way for a variety of ionic as well as covalently bonded solids .",
