    "galaxy counts from iras first hinted at strong evolution of luminous infrared galaxies @xcite .",
    "mid - infrared surveys made with the isocam instrument at 15 microns revealed an excess population at z@xmath20.8 @xcite .",
    "this population was detected in part by the redshifting of the strong 7.7 micron pah feature into the 15 micron band .",
    "the high sensitivity at 24 microns of the mips instrument @xcite onboard _ spitzer _ allows infrared - luminous galaxies to be traced to even higher redshifts .",
    "sensitivity to obscured starbursts at z@xmath22 is enhanced due to redshifting of the 7.7 micron feature into the 24 micron band .",
    "first source counts have been presented by @xcite for the deep great observatory origins deep survey ( goods ) test field , by @xcite for the first - look survey ( fls ) and the goods test field , and by @xcite for a range of guaranteed time observer ( gto ) fields plus the goods test field .",
    "these counts show a steep bump in the normalized source counts as fluxes decrease from several mjy to about 300 @xmath3jy , that is attributed to the population discovered by isocam at z@xmath20.8 plus a previously unseen population of galaxies at z@xmath21 - 2 . at still",
    "fainter fluxes , the normalized counts drop off to the _ spitzer _ confusion limit @xcite .",
    "this paper presents a detailed analysis of 24 micron source counts from the large fields observed for the _ spitzer _ wide - area infrared extragalactic ( swire ) program .",
    "the swire survey is the largest of the extragalactic _",
    "legacy science programs , comprising mapping of 49 square degrees at wavelength from 3.6 to 160 microns @xcite .",
    "this survey is designed to dramatically improve our understanding of galaxy evolution , including the history of star formation , the assembly of stellar mass in galaxies , the nature and impact of accretion processes in active nuclei , and the influence of environment on these processes at angular scales up to 3 deg ( such as the study of clustering of ultraluminous infrared galaxies by @xcite ) .",
    "the swire dataset encompasses six fields and so is an excellent resource for quantifying the effects of sample variance .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present accurate _",
    "24@xmath3 m counts in the flux ranging from 50 mjy to @xmath2300@xmath3jy .",
    "a detailed model - based interpretation of the counts is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , the composition of the counts is explored for the elais n1 field using the irac data at 3.6 - 8@xmath3 m @xcite as well as high - quality optical imaging .",
    "this merged dataset provides insights into galaxy seds and populations @xcite , and is used in this paper to break down the 24 @xmath3 m source counts by population and redshift .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the swire observations and data processing are described in section [ sec : data ] .",
    "the derivation and validation of source counts are presented in section [ sec : counts ] .",
    "comparison with models , including recent models updated using _ spitzer _",
    "counts , is in section [ sec : models ] . for the elais n1 field , optical identifications , photometric redshifts , and template - fitting lead to source counts subdivided by redshift and galaxy type in section [ sec : composition ] .",
    "the _ spitzer _ mapping observations of the six swire fields were carried out between december 2003 and december 2004 .",
    "for the mapping at 24 , 70 and 160 @xmath3 m , the following observing strategy using the mips instrument @xcite was implemented .",
    "the mips scan map astronomical observing template was used with medium scan rate .",
    "the spacing between scan legs was 148 arcseconds , approximately half of the width of the 5@xmath45  field of view ( fov ) of the 24@xmath3 m detector array .",
    "three - degree - long scan legs were used for most astronomical observing requests ( aors ) .",
    "five scan legs were typically used per aor , resulting in a cross - scan size of about 25 .",
    "the aors were arranged into two coverage sets , separated by half of an fov in the cross - scan direction .",
    "adjacent aors within a coverage set were overlapped sufficiently to ensure no gaps in coverage of the 70@xmath3 m array .",
    "the approximate dimensions of the maps are given in table [ tab : photounc ] .",
    ".area and photometric uncertainty for each field [ cols=\"<,^ , < , < \" , ]     we have also plotted the counts for the fls @xcite and gto fields @xcite for comparison . to put the papovich counts on the swire calibration",
    ", we multiplied the fluxes from that work by a factor 1.059 to account for our color correction , the change in calibration factor @xcite , and a very slight difference in aperture corrections .",
    "the fls counts were shifted assuming a flux scale fainter than ours by a factor of 1.11 , due to the color correction , the change in calibration factor , and our 5% larger aperture correction for a 30.5   diameter aperture . the steep rise in the normalized counts found by these works",
    "is confirmed by our results .",
    "there are some differences at brighter flux levels , but these appear to be within the range of the swire field - to - field variations shown by the error bars . also of note is a `` shoulder '' at about 3 mjy , seen in the total swire and @xcite counts , though not in the @xcite counts , and also not in the elais s1 counts ( figure [ fig : normswire ] ) .",
    "a plot of the normalized counts with several models overlaid is in figure [ fig : counts_models ] .",
    "the counts used include the swire counts , the @xcite counts at fainter fluxes , and iras counts from the sample of @xcite corrected to the mean mips wavelength of 23.7 @xmath3 m .",
    "the fitting of several pre-_spitzer_-launch models have already been discussed in @xcite and @xcite . here",
    "we focus on more recently available models .",
    "one of these models is described in detail in @xcite and is not outlined here .",
    "we give a thumbnail sketch of the other models in turn .",
    "the @xcite model is based on starburst+cirrus galaxies from @xcite and agn components from @xcite .",
    "these works are 15 micron models based on data from the elais survey @xcite .",
    "they have been converted to 24 microns using the appropriate ratio of 24@xmath3 m to 15@xmath3 m of each population .",
    "though this work was published after the launch of _ spitzer _ , it did not involve an _ a posteriori _ correction .",
    "the predicted 24@xmath3 m counts by @xcite are based on an ir multi - wavelength evolutionary model fitting a variety of data from spitzer , iso , scuba , and reproducing data on the diffuse far - ir background observed by cobe .",
    "the model basically adopts , in addition to normal spiral galaxies and type-1 quasars , two populations of starbursting galaxies with different luminosity functions and evolution rates .",
    "one population consists of moderate - luminosity starbursts with peak activity at z@xmath21 ( the lirg population ) , the second contains more luminous objects ( the ulirg and hylirg ) with maximum activity phase at z@xmath22 .",
    "this evolutionary bimodality is apparently required for a combined fit of the multi - wavelength counts and redshift distributions .",
    "the @xcite model includes a new evolution model for dusty galaxies and the e2 model for the e / s0s evolution @xcite .. the new dusty galaxy evolution model is a modified version of model s1 , the starburst - dominant model , in @xcite .",
    "the definitions of galaxy populations ( starbursts , normal - disks and agns ) are the same as in model s1 , as are the evolution parameters of the normal - disks and agns .",
    "both the luminosity evolution rate and density evolution rate of the starburst galaxies are on the order of @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 for larger redshifts .",
    "the major changes are in the seds of the starbursts and normal - disks : for both populations the strength of the pah features in the wavelength range of @xmath8 is raised by a factor of 2 .",
    "the model of @xcite is a modification of the counts model of @xcite .",
    "it retains the four infrared sed types of the latter , with no modification of the seds ( unlike the new models of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the four types still all undergo strong luminosity evolution but the evolution is allowed to be at a different rate in the different components . the evolution of the cirrus ( quiescent ) component is now shallower than the evolution of the m82 starburst component , and is considerably steeper for the arp 220 ( high optical depth starburst ) component . the evolution function",
    "is also modified so that the evolution is less steep at z @xmath9 0.5 ( as in the @xcite model ) .",
    "the stronger evolution in the arp 220 component makes the model similar to those of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but it still has the distinct feature of strong evolution even in the quiescent component .",
    "it is difficult to fit a steep bump in the normalized counts without restricting the luminosities in the models to a narrow range . that said , the models are successful in peaking at about the same flux level ( 0.3 mjy ) as the source counts .",
    "the counts rise rather more steeply with decreasing flux , however , so that they peak with counts about 25% higher than the models predict .",
    "some of this difference is due to the color correction and calibration changes applied to the counts , which increase flux by about 5.9% for the @xcite counts , and increase normalized counts by about 13% .",
    "the model curves could be scaled up by this factor , but in many cases would overpredict brighter sources .",
    "models which allow evolution of only the more luminous sources , including the possibility of discontinuous changes in the evolution rate , or large changes to source seds , have less difficulty in fitting the counts . by contrast ,",
    "models which use smoothly - changing evolution rates , like those of @xcite and @xcite , have more difficulty .",
    "it is important to establish what really is needed to account for the observed counts .",
    "it may be that pah emission and silicate absorption features at @xmath10 @xcite , or even silicate emission from agn @xcite , are stronger or play a larger role than is assumed by the models .",
    "we now turn to an investigation of the composition of the 24@xmath3 m counts . here",
    "we rely on the full optical and _ spitzer_-irac data available in the elais n1 field .",
    "we have associated our band - merged n1 catalogue , which contains all 24 @xmath3 m detections with a 3.6@xmath3 m counterpart to ensure high reliability , with the optical ugriz catalog generated from the int wfs data by @xcite , using a search radius of 1.5 arcsec .",
    "this search radius is appropriate for swire sources detected at 3.6 @xmath3 m @xcite .",
    "the proportion of 24 @xmath3 m blank fields brighter than s(24 ) = 200 @xmath3jy , to the wfs survey limit of r @xmath2 23.5 , is 28@xmath11 .",
    "all sources with optical associations have been run through the photometric redshift code of @xcite and @xcite , with small modifications to the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) described by @xcite .",
    "20@xmath11 of 24 @xmath3 m sources",
    "brighter than 200 @xmath3jy with optical associations failed to get a photometric redshift because there are less than 4 bands detected at ugriz , 3.6 , 4.5 @xmath3 m or because the reduced @xmath12 is too poor ( @xmath13 10 )",
    ". this can be because of erroneous optical photometry , incorrect optical associations , or because the range of optical templates used fails to characterize all sources .",
    "the latter possibility is worth further study , especially since , for example , strongly reddened quasars or galaxy+quasar combined seds are not included in the sed library .",
    "finally , the seds of all 24 @xmath3 m sources with photometric redshifts are fitted with infrared templates added to the optical / near ir galaxy and quasar template used in the photometric redshift fit , provided there is an excess in at least two bands relative to the optical / nir galaxy model .",
    "the templates used are those of @xcite , also used earlier in @xcite : cirrus , arp 220 starburst and a mixture of m82 starburst and agn dust torus .",
    "examples of sed fits using these templates are given by @xcite .",
    "for sources with an infrared excess only at 24@xmath3 m , for which we can not at this stage characterize the far infrared sed , we have fitted an m82 starburst template .",
    "photometric redshift distributions of 24@xmath3 m sources are shown in @xcite .",
    "the results of the template fitting may be used to break down the infrared counts by redshift range and type .",
    "the fraction of counts per redshift range is shown in figure [ fig : zfrac ] .",
    "a related plot is shown in figure 2 of @xcite but here we show the results as a fraction of total counts .",
    "overlaid are the same fractions taken from the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the templates fits and the model are generally in agreement for @xmath14 .",
    "the model yields a higher fraction in the higher redshift bins than the template fits ; however since some elais n1 sources did not receive a redshift in the fitting procedure , this may explain the difference .",
    "similar results were found by @xcite and @xcite in which the models generally underpredicted the sources in the low - redshift bins and overpredicted the number at higher redshifts .",
    "figure [ fig : typefrac ] shows the 24 @xmath3 m differential counts subdivided by infrared template type .",
    "we see that the steep rise between 1 mjy and 300 @xmath3jy is caused primarily by starbursts , and sources with a infrared excess at 24 @xmath3 m only . to really understand the 24 @xmath3 m counts , we need 70 @xmath3 m data for the sources with infrared excess over the fitted template at 24 @xmath3 m only .",
    "the fraction of sources with quasar - like infrared seds is below about 30% at bright fluxes , decreasing to less than 15% at relatively faint fluxes .",
    "the variation between fields of the swire 24@xmath3 m number counts shows the importance of sample variance . for fluxes near a few mjy ,",
    "the field - to - field variation in the counts is 50% to 100% larger than is accountable solely from poisson uncertainties .",
    "based on redshift estimates from template fitting and from models , the counts variations near 3 mjy may result from large - scale structures around @xmath15 . at fainter flux levels , the swire 24@xmath3 m catalogs will be useful for tracing structures at @xmath16 and beyond .",
    "the 24 @xmath3 m counts seem exceptionally interesting and most models published before the launch of _ spitzer _ miss badly",
    ". there may be new populations@xcite claim there is a large population of type 2 agn that have not been accounted for in previous models .",
    "the swire counts confirm a steep rise in the counts from about 2 to 0.3 mjy that is quite difficult for models to fit .",
    "template fitting to the swire en1 sources is successful for at least 85% of the galaxies .",
    "the photometric redshifts indicate that at least a quarter of the sources in the 1 - 10 mjy interval have photometric redshifts in the range 0.3 to 0.8 .",
    "the 25@xmath3 m band onboard iras is closest in wavelength space to the mips 24@xmath3 m passband .",
    "iras counts are complete to about 250 mjy @xcite and the swire counts go to about 1000x fainter .",
    "swire results should be the best 24 @xmath3 m counts above 250 @xmath3jy because it will cover the most area of the _ spitzer _ extragalactic surveys .",
    "the full area of _ spitzer _ surveys solidify the counts up to about 30 mjy , almost allowing linking up with the all - sky iras counts , but leaving a gap of a factor of ten in flux .",
    "it will be left for the _ akari ( astro - f ) _ and _ wise _ missions to bridge this gap .",
    "we are grateful to the referee for comments , which have led to substantial improvement of this paper .",
    "this work is based on observations made with the spitzer space telescope , which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology under a contract with nasa .",
