    "observations of redshifted 21 cm radiation from the large - scale distribution of neutral hydrogen ( hi ) are perceived one of the most important future probes of the universe at high redshifts , and there currently are several initiatives underway towards carrying out such observations .",
    "to list a few , the gmrt @xcite is already functioning at several bands in the frequency range @xmath0 to @xmath1 , while lofar , pstjbp ] and ska are in different stages of design and/or construction .",
    "these observations hold the potential of probing the hi evolution through epochs starting from the present all the way to @xmath2 when the universe was in the dark ages @xcite .",
    "variations with angle and with frequency ( or redshift ) of the redshifted 21 cm radiation brightness temperature give three dimensional maps of the hi distribution at high @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the signal is sensitive to the spin temperature @xmath4 of the hi hyperfine transition , and at any @xmath3 the hi will be observed in emission or absorption depending on whether @xmath4 is larger or smaller than @xmath5 the cmbr temperature . to get a picture of the expected signal",
    ", we outline below how @xmath4 evolves with @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath4 is governed by two tendencies , once which drives it towards @xmath5 and another towards @xmath6 the hi gas kinetic temperature .",
    "@xmath4 couples to @xmath5 through a radiative transition , and it couples to @xmath6 through atomic collisions and through the absorption and re - emission of ly-@xmath7 photons ( the wouthuysen -field effect , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the collisional process dominates at high densities where it causes @xmath8 to closely follow @xmath6 .",
    "the small density of free electrons , residual after hydrogen recombination at @xmath9 , transfers energy from the cmbr to the gas and maintains @xmath10 up to @xmath11 .",
    "the heat transfer is ineffective at @xmath12 , and the hi cools adiabatically whereby @xmath13 . the collisional process which maintains @xmath14 looses out to the radiative process at @xmath15 and @xmath4 approaches @xmath5 .",
    "thus , there is a redshift range @xmath16 where @xmath17 and the hi will be seen in absorption against the cmbr @xcite .",
    "the hi at these epochs largely traces the dark matter , and the hi maps would probe the power - spectrum of density perturbations at a high level of precision ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the first luminous objects , formed at @xmath18 , would heat the gas through the emission of soft x - ray photons ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and through ly-@xmath7 photons which would also couple @xmath4 to @xmath6 through the wouthuysen -field effect .",
    "the hi gas will now be partially heated , and the coupling of @xmath4 to @xmath6 will also be partial depending on the local flux of ly-@xmath7 photons .",
    "this is an additional source of fluctuation in the hi maps , and it may be possible to detect the presence of the first luminous objects in the redshift range @xmath19 through this effect ( @xcite , 2004b ) .",
    "the coupling of @xmath4 to @xmath6 is expected to be saturated by @xmath20 , and @xmath21 throughout the gas _ ie . _",
    "the hi will be seen in emission and the hi maps will again trace the dark matter .",
    "this changes at @xmath22 when a substantial fraction of the hi is ionized by the first luminous objects . during the epoch of reionization ,",
    "the hi maps trace the size , shape and topology of the ionized regions ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2003b ; @xcite , 2004b ) . at low redshifts ( @xmath23 ) ,",
    "the bulk of the hi is in the high column density clouds seen as dlas in quasar spectra ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these clouds are possibly disk galaxies or their progenitors , and they trace the dark matter , may be with some bias .",
    "the hi will be seen in emission , and the maps will trace the dark matter ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "though the hi signal in each redshift range will probe a different phase of the hi evolution and have it s own distinct signature , there is one thing in common throughout in that the clustering pattern will be anisotropic .",
    "the anisotropies in the clustering pattern are the results of two distinct effects .",
    "the first is the alcock - paczynski effect ( @xcite , hereafter the ap effect ) caused by the non euclidean geometry of space time and the second is the effect of peculiar velocities .",
    "the ap effect causes objects which are intrinsically spherical in real space to appear elongated along the line of sight in redshift space .",
    "this effect is particularly important at high redshifts ( @xmath24 ) where it is sensitive to the cosmological parameters which it can be used to probe .",
    "the two - point correlation function of the gravitational clustering of different kinds of objects is expected to be statistically isotropic , and this is a natural choice for applying this test .",
    "galaxy redshift surveys do not extend to sufficiently high redshifts for this effect to be significant .",
    "quasar redshift surveys extend to much higher redshifts and there has been a considerable amount of work ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) investigating the possibility of determining the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the main problem is that quasar surveys ( eg . sdss ) are very sparse and hence they are not optimal for determining the cosmological parameters ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have used the ap test to constrain cosmological parameters using the lyman - alpha forest .",
    "the redshift , used to infer radial distances , has a contribution from the line of sight component of the peculiar velocity and this introduces a preferred direction in the redshift space clustering pattern .",
    "there are two characteristic effects of peculiar velocities . on small scales ,",
    "the random motions in virialized regions causes the clustering pattern to appear elongated along the line of sight in redshift space . on large scales the coherent infall onto clusters and superclusters , and",
    "the outflow from voids causes the redshift space clustering pattern to appear compressed along the line of sight ( the kaiser effect , @xcite ) .",
    "this effect can be modeled using linear theory and the anisotropies in the redshift space clustering pattern can be used to determine the parameter @xmath27 where @xmath25 and @xmath28 are the cosmic mass density parameter and the linear bias parameter respectively ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the kaiser effect has been studied in the different large galaxy redshift surveys ( eg .",
    "sdss , 2dfgrs ) and a recent investigation of the redshift space distortions in the 2dfgrs yields a value of @xmath29 ( @xcite ) at an effective redshift @xmath30 .",
    "future redshift survey carried out using redshifted 21 cm hi radiation will allow the anisotropies arising from both the ap effect and the peculiar velocities to be studied to redshifts as high as @xmath31 and possibly higher , surpassing the potential of any future galaxy or quasar survey . in a recent paper @xcite has studied the ap effect in redshifted 21 cm maps of the epoch of reionization and he has proposed that a determination of the correlation of temperature fluctuations to an accuracy of @xmath32 should allow a successful application of the ap test to constrain the background cosmological model .",
    "@xcite have proposed that measuring the anisotropy of the hi power spectrum arising from peculiar velocities provides a means for distinguishing between the different sources which contribute to hi fluctuations .",
    "further , they propose that it may be possible to separate the primordial inflationary power spectrum imprinted in the dark matter from the various astrophysical sources which will also contribute to the hi fluctuations .",
    "in this paper we re - examine exactly what we hope to learn from observations of the anisotropy in hi maps .",
    "the previous analysis of @xcite using the power spectrum implicitly assumes that the background cosmological model is known to a great level of precision and hence does not take into account the anisotropies introduced by the geometry ( ap effect ) .",
    "we adopt a framework which allows high redshift hi observations to be interpreted without reference to a background cosmological model .",
    "we use the hi temperature two - point correlation function which deals with directly observeable quantities . using this framework",
    ", we quantify the anisotropy and study its dependence on the background cosmological model .",
    "the ap effect and the kaiser effect differ in their response to variations in the background cosmological model . to estimate the relative contributions from these two effect we also calculate the anisotropy ignoring the peculiar velocities .",
    "our work focuses on the signal expected from the epoch of reionization and the post re - ionization era , these being the most promising frequency bands for observations in the near future .",
    "the hi distribution in these eras is largely unknown , and it is expected to differ from the dark matter distribution . the hi is expected to have a very patchy distribution at epoch of reionization . determining the size , shape and distribution of the ionized regions is one of the main forces driving the effort towards future hi observations . the post - reionization hi will probably trace the dark matter with a bias . in addition",
    "the parameters of the background cosmological model , the anisotropy in the hi maps is expected to also be sensitive to the details of the high redshift hi distribution , the latter being largely unknown . in this paper",
    "we use simple models for the hi distribution to ask if observations of the anisotropy tell us more about the background cosmological models or the details of the hi fluctuations .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in section 2 .",
    "we explain the origin of the anisotropies and how they can be quantified . in section 3 .",
    "we present the background cosmological models and models for the hi distribution .",
    "section 4 contains the results and in section 5 .",
    "we present discussion and conclusions .    it may be noted that unless mentioned otherwise , we use the values @xmath33 throughout .",

    "it is convenient to represent such observations as @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the space of possible redshifts and directions of observation which we refer to as redshift space . here we assume that the redshift range and region of the sky under observation are both small . under this assumption , the separation between any two points in redshift space is @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the line of sight to the center of the region being observed , @xmath3 is the mean redshift , @xmath41 the difference in redshift and @xmath42 is the angular separation which is a two dimensional vector in the plane of the sky . it may be noted that @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the components of @xmath45 parallel and perpendicular to the line of sight @xmath40 , and we introduce the notation @xmath46 whereby @xmath47    we next shift our attention to quantifying the fluctuations in the hi brightness temperature .",

    "these models have a few parameters which quantify our ignorance about the hi distribution during these epochs . for the reionization era we have assumed that the total hydrogen content traces the dark matter , and the reionization proceeds through spherical bubbles of ionized gas of comoving radius @xmath145 .",
    "further , the centers of these bubbles could be biased with respect to the underlying dark matter . the hi in the post reionization era is assumed to be in high column density clouds which could be biased with respect to the underlying dark matter . for both the epochs we find that the anisotropies in the hi clustering pattern are sensitive to both , the background cosmological model and the free parameters determining the hi distribution .",
    "given the fact that very little is known a - priori about the high redshift hi distribution , we conclude that it will not be possible to use observations of the anisotropies alone to uniquely constrain the background cosmological model . it may be noted that our findings contradict earlier claims @xcite where it was proposed that the anisotropies in the epoch of reionization hi signal could be used to constrain the background cosmological model .",
    "we find that the anisotropy in the hi clustering is a combination of the contributions from both the ap effect and the peculiar velocities , and it can not be attributed to anyone of them alone .",
    "further , the anisotropy pattern at the epoch of reionization is very sensitive to the reionization model . in our simple model where the ionized bubbles are all of the same radius , we find a bump in the anisotropy pattern at the scales corresponding to the size of the bubbles .",
    "the bump will possibly be smeared in a more realistic situation where the bubbles will have a spread of sizes , but we may still expect a prominent feature at the scale corresponding to the characteristic bubble size .",
    "the anisotropy at large angular scales , we find , is sensitive to the bias of the centers of the ionized bubbles .",
    "our analysis leads us to the conclusion that observations of the anisotropy in the hi clustering at the epoch of reionization will be a very powerful probe of the size , shape and distribution of the ionized regions the uncertainties in these being much more than the uncertainties in the background cosmological model . in the post - reionization era",
    ", the changes in the value of the bias parameter have a similar effect as changing the background cosmological model .",
    "these observations can be used to constrain the cosmological model if the bias parameter can be determined by independent means like the bi - spectrum ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally we note that the temperature two - point correlation function considered here may not be the optimal statistical tool for detecting and quantifying the high redshift hi signal .",
    "the angular power spectrum @xcite and the visibility correlations ( @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) have been proposed as optimal statistics for this purpose . in this paper",
    "we have chosen to study the temperature two - point correlation because of its similarity to the galaxy two - point correlation function where the anisotropy introduced by redshift space distortions is well understood and has received much attention in the literature .",
    "though both the ap effect and the peculiar velocities are both included in @xcite and @xcite , how to make the best use of these observations to constrain background cosmological models and models for the hi distribution still remains an open issue .",
