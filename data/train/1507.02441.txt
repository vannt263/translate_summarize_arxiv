    "the issue of the mediators of high - temperature superconductivity in cuprates , the so - called `` glue issue '' , is still unsolved . on the one hand",
    ", there is the early proposal of an essentially instantaneous magnetically mediated pairing forming incoherent singlets eventually condensing in the superconducting state.@xcite on the other hand , it has been proposed that slow , nearly critical collective excitations mediate a retarded pairing . in this latter framework",
    "overdamped spin waves are a natural candidate due to the proximity of the superconducting phase to the mott insulating antiferromagnetic phase.@xcite how strong is the instantaneous or the retarded character of the magnetic superconducting glue is likely just a matter of quantitative balance.@xcite on the contrary , there are other proposals suggesting that the superconducting mediator could also have a non - magnetic character . in this",
    "regard , primary candidates are charge - ordering fluctuations , which were proposed as a source of retarded glue already long ago.@xcite this last proposal has steadily acquired importance with the progressive increasing experimental evidence of charge ordering as a common feature of cuprates via neutron scattering,@xcite nmr and nqr,@xcite exafs,@xcite arpes,@xcite stm,@xcite and raman scattering,@xcite until it has become a compelling evidence due to the recent direct observation by resonant x - ray scattering.@xcite    the evidence of charge ordering and the simultaneous natural presence of spin waves emanating from the nearby afm state raises the issue of coexistence , interplay , and possible causal relationship between charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "an early point of view is that charge ordering arises from coulomb - frustrated charge segregation due to short - range ( essentially instantaneous ) magnetic interactions@xcite or / and due to non - magnetic ( e.g. , phononic@xcite , charge - transfer@xcite , ... ) attractive forces . in both cases , the concomitant presence of charge - ordering fluctuations `` enslaves '' the spin degrees of freedom , allowing them to survive up to large doping .",
    "this tight entangling of spin and charge degrees of freedom is also an intrinsic feature of the ` stripe' concept.@xcite a complementary , more recent , view is that collective retarded spin fluctuations may give rise to attraction in the particle - hole channel inducing a charge - density wave instability.@xcite at the moment , it is unclear and debated whether these two points of view are really distinct or just some kind of `` egg - and - chicken '' issue arising from an underlying continuous interplay between charge and spin degrees of freedom . in any case",
    "it seems by now rather natural to assume that charge - density waves and spin - density waves coexist and it is quite interesting to investigate the relative weight of these different excitations in mediating the effective electron - electron interaction in cuprates in the different doping and temperature regimes .",
    "this is precisely the focus of the present work .",
    "the presence of two distinct sources of glue in cuprates was found both in optical@xcite , arpes@xcite and raman@xcite experiments .",
    "these experiments identify the so - called `` glue function ''",
    "@xmath3 , introduced by eliashberg to characterize the spectral distribution and the strength of the electron - phonon coupling in the superconducting pairing.@xcite from optical conductivity it is found that the glue function has a double structure with a rather narrow and temperature dependent peak at low frequencies ( below @xmath4@xmath5 ) and a broad structure extending up @xmath6@xmath5 . from the characteristic frequency ranges it is quite natural to attribute the first peak to phononic excitations , while the mediators responsible for the broad peak should be diffusive magnetic excitations.@xcite however , neutron scattering experiments show that the magnetic excitations have a rather rich spectral structure,@xcite which , besides the broad high - frequency peak , also display a low - frequency peak .",
    "moreover , time - resolved optical spectroscopy finds that also the low - frequency peak could be related to electronic excitations.@xcite thus the attribution and identification of the various excitations responsible for the effective electron - electron interaction is still an open relevant issue . in this framework , the analysis of raman spectra is interesting because this technique is able to explore selectively different regions of the electronic brillouin zone allowing to extract more detailed information on the electronic excitations than the optical conductivity .",
    "this selectivity of raman spectra was already exploited in ref . to identify and characterize the double nature of the electronic mediators , but",
    "the analysis was carried out fitting the experiments by analytic expressions arising from a specific assumption on the form of the charge and spin collective excitations .",
    "in particular the standard diffusive form of nearly critical overdamped collective modes near gaussian quantum critical points was assumed .",
    "this not only allowed a good fitting of the spectra , but allowed to attribute the markedly different shape of the raman spectra in the different channel ( the @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering channels obtained by differently polarizing the incoming and outgoing photons of the raman scattering ) to different , spin and charge , excitations , which acted differently on the spectra according to their different characteristic wavevectors .",
    "although successful , this approach was starting from specific assumptions on the form of the mediators , which had the single spectral structure of overdamped modes .",
    "it is therefore quite important to test and deepen the conclusions of ref . with a more flexible and general approach",
    "in this work we apply two different numerical inversion techniques to extract the glue function from the raman spectra and we draw consistent conclusions : i ) two distinct excitations are responsible for the glue function , which have completely different doping dependence ; ii ) there is a marked temperature dependence of the weight and spectral distribution of these excitations , which therefore must have a somewhat critical character . indeed ,",
    "if they were just the result of low - energy phonon - mediated interaction and high - energy local excitations due to strong - correlation effects , any temperature dependence would hardly occur .",
    "our analysis is purposely carried out on optimally and overdoped samples to highlight the specific features of the bosonic interaction mediators only .",
    "this analysis could of course be extended to the underdoped regime , where , however , the presence of a pseudogap in the fermionic spectrum introduces additional temperature , doping , and momentum dependencies , which would be superimposed to those of the bosonic mediators .",
    "this would make the interpretation of the data much less conclusive and informative .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the two numerical methods adopted to extract the glue function from the raman spectra .",
    "sections iii and iv contain the results of our analysis of the glue functions and of their low - frequency behavior .",
    "finally , section v reports and discusses our concluding remarks .",
    "appendices a and b contain technical details on the implementation of the inversion procedure , while appendix c contains details on the extraction of the low - frequency properties of the glue function .",
    "in this work we analyze raman spectra from ref . in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels in la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) samples for different temperatures and doping levels .",
    "electronic raman scattering is a bulk ( nearly surface - insensitive ) probe and it measures a response function @xmath9 analogous to that of the optical conductivity .",
    "the raman response function can be expressed@xcite as a function of the so - called memory function @xmath10 as @xmath11 $ ] for complex arguments @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the ( real ) `` bare '' response function computed in absence of any scattering process . the imaginary part of the response function , @xmath14 , can be written as : @xmath15 ^ 2 + [ m''(\\omega)]^2}.\\ ] ] here , the real and imaginary parts of the memory functions , @xmath16 , are function of the real frequency @xmath17 , and they are related by a kramers - kronig ( kk ) transformation . in turn , @xmath18 can be expressed@xcite in terms of the glue function @xmath19 by means of the integral expression @xmath20 with the kernel @xmath21\\ , .",

    "the coefficients @xmath24 are then used as fit parameters .",
    "we used and compare the results obtained with two very different choices for the basis functions , the first one based on a multi - rectangle decomposition ( mrd ) of the glue function , and the second based on the singular vector expansion of the kernel @xmath30 .    * * multi - rectangle decomposition ( mrd)*. the glue function is approximated by a piecewise constant function , which corresponds to choosing a partition of the frequency axis @xmath31 and @xmath32 non - overlapping box functions @xmath33 for @xmath34 and @xmath35 elsewhere , as the basis functions .",
    "the fitting parameters @xmath24 are the heights of the box functions . in the mrd approach the functions @xmath36 can then be computed analytically ( see appendix  [ sect : binning_appendix ] for further details ) . * * singular vector decomposition ( svd)*. the starting point of this approach is the expansion of the integral kernel eq .   as a sum of diadic operators : @xmath37 where the singular values @xmath38 are nonnegative and in decreasing order , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are sets of orthogonal functions , called the left and right singular vectors , respectively . in this case",
    "we approximate the glue function using as basis the first @xmath32 right - singular vectors of the singular vector decomposition of the kernel @xcite .",
    "this allows us to define @xmath41 .",

    "further details about the choice of the functions @xmath53 and @xmath13 , and in the discretization and in the fitting procedures can be found in appendices  [ sect : binning_appendix ] ( mrd ) and [ sect : svd_appendix ] ( svd ) .",
    "we analyze raman spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath1cuo@xmath2 samples focusing on three different doping levels ( @xmath54 ) and three different temperatures ( approximately 50 , 100 and 200k ; the true temperatures for different doping levels are slightly different ) , to highlight the doping and temperature evolution . in fig.[fig : figure1 ] we show the glue functions obtained with both mrd and svd techniques by analyzing data of three different doped samples ( @xmath54 ) at @xmath55k , for both the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels .",
    "the glue function obtained by svd has an oscillatory character , due to the fact that it is obtained by summing up oscillating functions with increasing frequency , similarly to a fourier expansion .",

    "some sort of indeterminacy is an inevitable consequence of the structure of the problem .",

    ", one can notice that despite the different `` looks '' of the glue functions obtained with the two approaches , some features are common and therefore more reliable . indeed , both approaches yield in both channels two structures : a low - frequency peak ( @xmath56@xmath57 ) and a broader structure in the range 5003000@xmath57 .",
    "the @xmath7 channel appears to be suppressed as the doping is increased , while the secondary structure in the @xmath8 glue function shifts to lower frequencies as the doping is increased .",
    "these behaviors are also present at @xmath58 and 200k .",
    "this latter case is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure1b ] . due to the behavior of the kernel at high temperature ( see discussion in appendix  [ sect : svd_appendix_fitting ] ) , the structures of the glue functions are rougher , but still the main features found at @xmath59k persist , namely a generic two - peak structure and a different doping dependence of the two channels .",
    "we can quantify these features by computing the total spectral weight @xmath60 of the glue function and the fraction of the weight below a cutoff frequency @xmath61@xmath57 , as @xmath62 in particular , the ratio between @xmath63 and @xmath60 gives us the magnitude of the low - frequency structure with respect to the higher - frequency one .",

    "interestingly , @xmath74 can be directly connected to the low - frequency behavior of the glue function @xmath75 . as detailed in appendix[sect : appendix_lowtemp_2 ] , @xmath74 is proportional to an `` effective '' slope @xmath76 of the glue function , obtained by a weighted average of @xmath77 with a fast decaying weight , similar to @xmath78 .",
    "the relationship between @xmath76 and @xmath74 is given by @xmath79 if the glue function is approximately linear for @xmath80 , then @xmath76 is approximately equal to its slope . on the other hand ,",
    "if the glue function has two peaks , one for @xmath80 and the other one in @xmath81 , the quantity @xmath76 is related to the magnitude and steepness of the first peak only , similarly to the ratio @xmath82 discussed before . as already discussed , while the derivative of the glue function can not be reliably estimated from the fitted glued function without some kind of smoothening procedure , integrated quantities , like @xmath76 in , are much better suited for the analysis of the glue function properties .",
    "we find that @xmath74 displays a clear temperature trend , which is well described as a @xmath83 scaling for both the channels .",
    "furthermore , the two channels have a marked opposite dependence on the doping .",

    "these results are in agreement with the analysis shown in the previous section .",
    "the total weight @xmath86 in the @xmath7 channel decreases almost linearly with the doping , but not @xmath87 , therefore reducing @xmath76 . on the other hand , in the @xmath8 channel",
    ", the total weight is constant , but @xmath87 increases with @xmath68 ; as the low - frequency peak `` drains '' spectral weight from the second one , the slope @xmath76 also increases .    , for different channels ( @xmath7 , circles ; @xmath8 , triangles ) and doping levels ( @xmath65 , yellow ; @xmath88 , pale green ; @xmath64 , dark green ) . here",

    "the raman spectra in the two , b@xmath91 and b@xmath92 , channels are markedly different : the @xmath7 spectra have a rounded rise at low frequency until a new rounded growth takes place above 2000 @xmath5 , while the @xmath8 spectra have a flattish shape at low / intermediate frequencies until again a rounded growth takes place above 2000@xmath5 .",
    "this difference naturally stems from different physical mechanisms ruling the low / intermediate - frequency scattering mechanisms . according to the most popular scenarios of superconducting cuprates ,",
    "spin and charge collective excitations are the most likely candidates as mediators of scattering . in a previous work@xcite we noticed that the different direction and magnitude of the characteristic wavevectors of these excitations produce different contributions in the two channels of the raman spectra .",
    "specifically , it was found that charge fluctuations with characteristic wavevectors @xmath93 ( in reciprocal lattice units ) are more visible in the low - frequency spectra in the @xmath8 channel . on the contrary ,",
    "spin fluctuations with characteristic wavevectors @xmath94 ( in reciprocal lattice units ) contribute more in the low - frequency spectra of the @xmath7 channel . at higher frequencies",
    "both modes contribute to both channels . while the previous analysis assumed a phenomenological quantum critical form of the spin and charge excitations leading to analytic but obviously model - dependent glue functions , our main goal here is to put under scrutiny the previous results with an unbiased general analysis .",
    "therefore within a memory - function approach we extracted the glue function directly form the raman spectra without any assumption . to this purpose , we used two inversion methods : the svd and the mrd .",
    "the overall shapes of the extracted glue functions are similar with both methods ( see fig.[fig : figure1 ] ) : in both channels they show a rather narrow low - frequency peak below 5001000@xmath5 and a broad hump up to 30004000@xmath5 . despite the similarity of the two channels",
    ", a closer inspection shows that the doping dependency is just opposite , with the @xmath7 glue function rapidly decreasing with doping above the optimal , while the glue function extracted from the @xmath8 spectra stays roughly constant .",
    "more than this , one can notice that the frequency above which the @xmath8 glue functions vanishes shrinks passing from the 30004000@xmath5 range , at @xmath65 , to about 2000@xmath5 , when @xmath64 .",
    "this points to the natural interpretation that spin waves underly the @xmath7 glue function at all frequencies , while charge excitations are responsible for the low / intermediate - frequency scattering in the @xmath8 channel . in this channel spin waves also contribute , but mostly at high frequencies .",
    "when doping suppresses the spin - mediated scattering , the overall @xmath7 glue decreases as well as the high - frequency part of the @xmath8 .",
    "the marked difference of the doping dependence in the two channels is also visible from both the low - frequency and total spectral weights of the glue functions ( see fig.[fig : figure2 ] )",
    ". a marked increase of the low - energy excitations involved in the @xmath8 channel is also clear form fig .",
    "[ fig : figure2](c , d ) .",
    "the glue functions extracted here are in overall agreement with those obtained from other techniques .",
    "a peaked feature below 1000 @xmath5 is also present in optical experiment @xcite and in low - energy spin excitations revealed by inelastic neutron scattering ( ins)@xcite . at higher energies ( up to 0.3 - 0.4 ev ) broad humps are found in optical spectra like those obtained within our analysis , which can be identified as due to spin excitations both from neutron scattering@xcite and from resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) @xcite . at the same time there is increasing evidence from both nmr@xcite and rixs@xcite that cdw are ubiquitous low - energy excitations in cuprates .",
    "it is therefore natural to identify them with the excitations involved in the @xmath8 channel .",
    "our results also display a general agreement with theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite , arpes results in bi@xmath95sr@xmath95cacu@xmath95o@xmath96 samples .",
    "in particular there is full consistency concerning the coexistence of two distinct collective modes and with the softening of the mode(s ) near the `` hot '' antinodal region .",
    "it is noticeable that this agreement is present despite the obvious differences between the raman response and the electron self - energy . in particular the former",
    "is resolved with respect to the electron momentum , while it is integrated over all the momenta of the bosons dressing the single - particle fermionic propagator . on the other hand",
    ", the raman response obeys some ( partial ) cancellations when the boson momenta and the raman form factors interplay@xcite . from ref .",
    "one sees that the mode , which softens in the antinodal region , gets more strongly coupled in the underdoped region and could be identified with our spin - fluctuation mode",
    ". the ( momentum averaged ) energy of the other mode stays more constant over the electronic momentum space and it acquires relatively more weight increasing the doping above optimal doping .",
    "this leads to the identification of this mode with our mixed phonon - cdw mode , which becomes prominent when doping increases above the optimal level .",
    "concerning the temperature dependence , ins find below @xmath97 a sharpening of the low - energy part of the spin - fluctuation spectra ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) , accounting for the clear observation of this mode in the arpes spectra ( ref.s ) below @xmath97 ( the contribution of the other broad featureless , nearly temperature independent part of spin fluctuations being naturally buried in the broad incoherent parts of the electron self - energies ) .",
    "the softening of the charge modes extracted ( mainly ) from the raman ( @xmath8 ) spectra is only expected to occur near the antinodal region and therefore in arpes may be overshadowed by the softening of the other spin mode .",
    "our selectivity in momentum allows instead to disentangle the contributions of the modes to the different raman channels and to detect a substantial softening of the charge mode as well .",
    "our work focuses on temperatures above @xmath97 and finds a distinct temperature behavior for the overall and the low - energy parts of the spectra .",
    "specifically , we notice a rather weak dependence of the overall spectra , which becomes more pronounced in the low - frequency weight .",
    "this indicates that the excitations might have a low - frequency component with a marked temperature dependence .",
    "indeed , as explained in sec .",
    "iv , exploiting analytic low - frequency expansions of the memory function and of the glue functions extracted , e.g. , via the svd method , we are able to identify a substantial temperature dependence of the the imaginary part of the memory function at zero frequency .",
    "this is related [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowfreq_1 ] ) ] to the slope of the raman response near @xmath98 . in turn , this is related to the effective slope of the glue function @xmath76 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : lowfreq_3 ] ) , which is a rather robust quantity extracted from a weighted average of @xmath77 that is only weakly sensitive on the oscillatory character of the svd fitted glue functions . these strong temperature dependencies at low frequency are suggestive of some form of critical behavior of the mediating excitations .",
    "if for a while we borrow the analytic expressions of the glue functions calculated in ref . , we find @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the mass of a collective mode ( i.e. , the minimum energy needed to excite it ) and is proportional to the square of the inverse correlation length of the corresponding fluctuations , while @xmath101 represents the coupling between fermionic quasiparticles and the collective modes .",
    "thus , although in this work we purposely avoided any assumption on the mediator , we interestingly find that our results support a marked temperature dependence of its mass , as it is seen in fig.[fig9 ] .    within a quantum critical scenario , the masses are expect to vary linearly with @xmath102 in the quantum critical regime , and saturate in the quantum disordered regime .",
    "of course drawing any conclusion on this dependence with three temperatures only is out of question , but a clear indication of nearly critical mediators , with a certain tendency of the mass to flatten as a function of temperature at low @xmath102 , can still be obtained .",

    "however , the relevant features of the calculated glue function are robust enough , upon varying the doping and the temperature , as discussed in sec.[sect : fit_results ] .",
    "we performed our calculations comparing the results obtained with @xmath1418,12 , and 25 bins , to ensure that the main features of the glue function were robust with respect to variations in the mrd scheme .",
    "in this section we describe in a detailed way the svd - based fitting procedure . the first step is to discretize the kernel @xmath142 in eq .. this is done by using two ( possibly different ) meshes @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "logarithmic meshes , or combinations of linear ( at small frequencies ) and logarithmic ( at large frequencies ) meshes , can be used .",
    "the integration measure is associated to the kernel , so that eq .",
    "becomes : @xmath145 the svd , although computationally demanding , provides the best low - rank approximation of the kernel @xmath30 , a result known as the eckart  young theorem . in this sense , it is the ideal tool to approximate solutions of integral equations .",
    "however , a nave application of the svd to the kernel in eq .   produces basis vectors @xmath146 with undesirable properties .",
    "( 1 ) on physical grounds , we require that the glue function goes to zero at large frequency ( at least as @xmath147 , see ref . ) . however , the integration kernel @xmath30 is long - ranged , in the sense that it is nonzero for large @xmath17 and @xmath12 . as a result",
    ", the singular vectors @xmath148 do not go to zero for large @xmath12 , making hard to constrain @xmath22 to be small at large frequencies .",
    "( 2 ) even worse , the kernel @xmath142 diverges as @xmath149 for @xmath150 ; therefore , the svd of the kernel produces basis vectors @xmath146 which also divergent in 0 .",
    "this is in sharp constrast with the fact that the glue function should go to zero at small frequencies in order to ensure the convergence of the integral , eq .  .",
    "as described in appendix  [ sect : binning_appendix ] , within the mrd approach these two problems are easily solved by choosing bins with lower edges larger than zero ( thus providing a cutoff to the integral ) and upper edges smaller than a maximum frequency @xmath151@xmath57 . in the svd context , the solution to these problems requires to expand a properly regularized kernel instead of the original one ; we will detail our procedures in the next sections .      in order to perform numerically the integral in eq . , some cutoff frequency @xmath152 has to be introduced . due to the long - range nature of the kernel ,",
    "the @xmath153 eigenfunctions are strongly dependent on the cutoff .",
    "therefore , the choice of the cutoff should be motivated by physical reasons , and we have to check that the results are only weakly dependent on the particular cutoff choice .",
    "let us note that the integration kernel @xmath142 goes to zero for @xmath154 [ see eq . ] .",
    "this means that high frequency ( @xmath155 ) components of the glue function do not contribute to the memory functions at low frequency ( @xmath156 ) and , vice versa , that only the low - frequency part of the glue function can be fitted from low - frequency data .",
    "we can explicitly set to zero the high - frequency part of the glue function introducing a cutoff function @xmath157 as @xmath158 where @xmath157 is 1 at low frequencies and goes to zero at high frequencies , and @xmath159 does not diverge in the @xmath160 limit .",
    "many choices for the cutoff function @xmath157 are possible , for instance a power law decay @xmath161 or an exponential decay , e.g. , @xmath162,\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for suitable parameters @xmath152 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 .",
    "we find that the results depend only weakly on the cutoff , as the support of the fitted glue functions is concentrated before 20003000@xmath57 .",
    "therefore , we will write @xmath165 and fit @xmath166 to the experimental data using the cut off kernel @xmath167 .",
    "after a function @xmath166 has been determined , the corresponding glue function is obtained from eq ..      the divergence in @xmath168 of the kernel implies that the right eigenfunctions ( which are used as a basis function for the glue function ) are divergent in zero . since @xmath169",
    ", we want to approximate the glue function using a set of functions for which @xmath170 .",
    "this can be accomplished by expanding a suitable regularized kernel instead of the original one .",
    "we can write : @xmath171 where @xmath172 is regular in @xmath150 , and @xmath173 .",
    "we can use the svd decomposition for the regular part of the kernel , and study the effect of the second term on the solution .",
    "of course , @xmath174 is still divergent , but the right eigenfunctions of @xmath172 go to zero fast enough to regularize the integral .",
    "putting together the cutoff definition , eq .",
    ", and the decomposition into regular and divergent part , eq .  , we are able to recast the initial equation eq .   in the following form : @xmath175 f(z ) \\nonumber\\\\   & + \\int { \\text{d}}z\\ ; [ k_d(z)q(z ) ] f(z).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we then perform the svd on the new kernel @xmath176 $ ] , rather than on the original kernel @xmath142 , as follows : @xmath177 where @xmath32 is the number of singular vectors we use to approximate the kernel .",
