    "two - neutron transfer reactions such as ( t , p ) or ( p , t ) have been used for many years in order to study the nuclear pairing correlations ( for a recent review see ref .",
    "the corresponding pair transfer modes are usually described in terms of pairing vibrations or pairing rotations @xcite .",
    "high energy collective pairing modes , called giant pairing vibrations ( gpv ) , were also predicted @xcite , but they have not been observed yet .",
    "recently there is a renewed interest for the study of two - neutron transfer reactions with weakly bound exotic nuclei .",
    "these reactions would provide valuable information about the pairing correlations in nuclei far from stability .",
    "the use of two - neutron transfer reactions with exotic nuclei can also increase the chance of exciting the gpv mode , as discussed recently in ref.@xcite .",
    "the two - particle transfer modes are commonly described by the particle - particle ( pp)-rpa @xcite in the case of closed shell nuclei and by the qrpa @xcite in open shell nuclei .",
    "most of the cross section calculations use the distorted wave born approximation ( dwba ) .",
    "the form factor is usually calculated by means of macroscopic models @xcite or by using the bayman and kallio method @xcite .",
    "several aspects of the model are under discussion , especially for absolute cross section calculations @xcite : one - step or sequential two - step process , triton wave function , zero - range or finite - range dwba .",
    "the so - called 0s @xcite approximation is also generally used to calculate the cross section in the dwba framework . in the latter approximation ,",
    "the qrpa solutions act as a spectroscopic factor @xcite , therefore the microscopic information does not affect the shape of the form factor .",
    "the calculation of the two - particle transfer modes in nuclei far from stability presents additional difficulties compared to the case of stable nuclei .",
    "one of such difficulties is related to the continuum coupling , which becomes important in nuclei close to the driplines .",
    "therefore in nuclei close to the driplines the pair transfer , the ground state properties and the continuum coupling should be calculated consistently .",
    "the aim of this paper is to present such a consistent description of the two - particle transfer in the framework of the continuum - qrpa ( cqrpa ) approach recently developed in ref.@xcite . in the cqrpa",
    "the continuum is treated exactly and the residual interaction is derived from the same effective force used in hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) for calculating the ground state properties . in this way the fluctuations of the particle and pairing densities , which are coupled together in the cqrpa , are calculated on the same footing with the ground state densities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the cqrpa model and we show how the response function for the two - particle transfer is calculated within this model . in section iii",
    "we discuss the response function for the particular case of two neutrons transferred to the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes . in section",
    "iv we present the calculation of cross sections for the transfer reaction @xmath1o(t , p ) .",
    "due to the concept of quasiparticle ( qp ) , the qrpa unifies on the same ground the particle - hole(ph)-rpa and the pp - rpa with the inclusion of the pairing effects . in the continuum - qrpa model ,",
    "presented in detail in ref.@xcite , the response of the nuclear system to an external perturbation is obtained from the time - dependent hfb equations ( tdhfb ) @xcite :    @xmath2,\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the time - dependent generalized density and the hfb hamiltonian , respectively .",
    "@xmath5 is the external oscillating field : @xmath6 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pert ] ) @xmath7 includes both particle - hole and two - particle transfer operators : @xmath8 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 are the particle creation and annihilation operators , respectively .    in the small amplitude limit the tdhfb equations",
    "become : @xmath11 + [ { \\cal h}^0,{\\cal              r}']+[f,{\\cal r}^0],\\ ] ] where the superscript   stands for the corresponding perturbed quantity .",
    "the variation of the generalized density @xmath3 is expressed in term of 3 quantities , namely @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are written as a column vector :    @xmath15    where @xmath16 is the variation of the particle density , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the fluctuations of the pairing tensor associated to the pairing vibrations and @xmath19 denotes the change of the ground state wavefunction @xmath20 due to the external field .",
    "in contrast with the rpa where one needs to know only the change of the ph density ( @xmath12 ) , the variation of the three quantities ( [ eq : rhodef ] ) have to be calculated in the qrpa . in the three dimensional space introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhodef ] ) , the first dimension represents the particle - hole ( ph ) subspace , the second the particle - particle ( pp ) one , and the third the hole - hole ( hh ) one .",
    "the response matrix has therefore 9 coupled elements in qrpa , compared to one in the rpa formalism .",
    "the variation of the hfb hamiltonian is given by :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 is the matrix of the residual interaction expressed in terms of the second derivatives of the hfb energy functional , namely :    @xmath23    in the above equation the notation @xmath24 means that whenever @xmath25 is 2 or 3 then @xmath24 is 3 or 2 .    introducing for the external field the three dimensional column vector :    @xmath26    the density changes can be written in the standard form :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the qrpa green s function obeying the bethe - salpeter equation :    @xmath29    the unperturbed green s function @xmath30 has the form :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 are the qp energies and @xmath33 are 3 by 2 matrices expressed in term of the two components of the hfb wave functions @xcite . the @xmath34 @xmath35   symbol in eq .",
    "( [ eq : g0 ] ) indicates that the summation is taken both over the discrete and the continuum qp states .",
    "the qrpa green s function can be used for calculating the strength function associated with various external perturbations .",
    "for instance the transitions from the ground state to the excited states induced by a particle - hole external field can be described by the strength function :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the ( ph , ph ) component of the qrpa green s function .",
    "examples of such calculations can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the quantity of interest in this work is the strength function describing the two - particle transfer from the ground state of a nucleus with a nucleons to the excited states of a nucleus with a+2 nucleons .",
    "this strength function is :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 denotes the ( pp , pp ) component of the green s function .",
    "in the cqrpa model presented above one should calculate in the first step the ground state of the system within the continuum - hfb ( chfb ) approach @xcite .",
    "the chfb equations are solved in coordinate space assuming spherical symmetry . in the chfb calculations presented here the mean field quantities",
    "are evaluated using the skyrme interaction sly4 @xcite , while for the pairing interaction we take a zero - range density - dependent force .",
    "the parameters of the pairing force used here for calculating the neutron - rich oxygen isotopes are taken the same as in ref @xcite .",
    "these parameters are fixed for a model space determined by a qp energy cut - off equal to 50 mev and a maximum angular momentum j=9/2 .",
    "the hf single - particle and hfb qp energies corresponding to the @xmath40 shell and to the @xmath41 state are listed in table [ tab : hf ] . in both hf and chfb calculations",
    "the state @xmath41 is a wide resonance for @xmath42o nuclei , while the state @xmath43 is a narrow resonance .    in the cqrpa calculations we include the full discrete and continuum qp spectrum up to 50 mev .",
    "these states , which generate a two - quasiparticle spectrum with a maximum energy of 100 mev , are used to construct the unperturbed green s function @xmath44 .",
    "the residual interaction is derived from the two - body force used in chfb according to eq.(2.7 ) .",
    "the contribution given by the velocity - dependent terms of the skyrme force to the residual interaction is calculated in the landau - migdal approximation . due to this approximation",
    "the self - consistency of the hfb+qrpa equations is not exactly preserved in the numerical calculations .",
    "therefore , the spurious mode associated with the center - of - mass motion is not at zero energy . in order to put the spurious state energy to zero",
    "we renormalize the residual interaction by a factor equal to 0.80 for all the calculated isotopes .",
    "the goldstone mode is also located at zero energy in the ph monopole response with this renormalization .",
    "the strength function for the two - neutron transfer is calculated using eq .",
    "( [ eq : stren2 ] ) . for the radial function",
    "@xmath45 we take the form @xmath46 , which is equal to the unity for the l=0 pair transfer mode considered here @xcite .",
    "the unperturbed green s function is calculated with an averaging interval @xmath47 equal to 0.15 ( 1.0 ) mev for excitations energies below ( above ) 11 mev .",
    "the results for the strength function corresponding to a neutron pair transferred to the oxygen isotopes @xmath48o are shown in fig . [",
    "fig : oxystrength ] .",
    "the exact continuum treatment is also compared to box discretization calculations ( the box radius is 22.5 fm , and the averaging interval @xmath47 is 0.15 mev ) . for the isotopes",
    "@xmath49o the first three peaks correspond to a pair transferred mainly to the states @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively .",
    "for the isotope @xmath1o the subshell @xmath53 is essentially blocked for the pair transfer . therefore in this nucleus",
    "we can clearly identify only two peaks below 11 mev , corresponding to a pair transferred to the states @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for all the isotopes we can see a broad resonant structure around 20 mev which is built mainly upon the single - particle resonant sate @xmath41 .",
    "this two - quasiparticle broad resonance has the characteristics of a giant pairing vibration @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the continuum treatment affects the magnitude of the lowest state for the three responses .",
    "this is due to the collective nature of this state , since unbound configurations such as the ( 1d@xmath54)@xmath55 contribute to this low - lying state .",
    "this points to the necessity to use exact continuum calculations even to predict transitions towards low - lying states .",
    "the state at 9.8 mev on the @xmath1o + 2n spectrum is embedded in the continuum and it is naturally more affected by the continuum treatment .    the influence of the residual interaction on the pair transfer modes is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : o22trength ] for the case of @xmath1o+2n , emphasizing the collective nature of the pairing response and the difference between pairing rotations and pairing vibrations @xcite .",
    "as expected , the residual interaction shifts down the position of the two - quasiparticle resonant states and increases their strengths .",
    "pairing rotations occur for open shell nuclei when many 0@xmath56 pairs of nucleon are feeding the ground state , forming a superfluid condensate",
    ". this should be the case for the g@xmath57 response where a pair is added in a pure two - quasiparticle configuration , increasing the number of pairs of the superfluid condensate .",
    "pairing vibrations are collective states where the pair contributions are mixed by the residual interaction and they should therefore be described by the g response . in the @xmath1o",
    "+ 2n case , pairing vibrations are much stronger than pairing rotations , due to the relatively small number of pairs ( ` ~`4 ) which contribute to the superfluid condensate to form a pairing rotation mode .",
    "the first two peaks located at 2.1 mev and 10.8 mev in the g@xmath57 response correspond to the addition of two neutron qp on the ( 2s@xmath58)@xmath55 and ( 1d@xmath54)@xmath55 subshells , respectively . apart from that , we can also notice a sensitive change in the spreading widths of the two - quasiparticle resonant states when the residual interaction is turned on . thus , due to the mixing of the configurations @xmath59 and @xmath60 by the residual interaction , the broad peak around 18 mev becomes narrower and the narrow peak around 10 mev becomes wider .",
    "this is a general effect which appears whenever in the two - body wave functions wide and narrow single - particle resonant states are mixed together @xcite .",
    "the dwba calculation of the cross section for the two - neutron transfer requires the form factor , which represents the correlation between the two neutrons and the initial nucleus @xcite . in order to compare the influence of various approximations",
    ", the form factor is calculated below by three different ways : macroscopically , by the so - called bayman and kallio method , and using the cqrpa model .",
    "the calculations based on the cqrpa allows for a straightforward study of the effects of the pairing correlations and of the continuum coupling upon the cross section .",
    "the form factors and the cross sections will be calculated below for the particular transfer reaction @xmath1o(t , p ) .      in refs.@xcite",
    "the form factor is calculated from the variation of the optical potential u with respect to the change of the number of particles :    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the so - called pairing deformation parameter representing the strength of the two - neutron pairing transfer reaction . using for the nuclear radius the relation @xmath63 one gets :    @xmath64    where    @xmath65    eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmacr2 ] ) is referred to the macroscopic form factor . in this model for the form factor",
    "the transfer is considered as an inelastic process corresponding to a deformation parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : beta ] ) .",
    "one advantage of this model is that the two - particle transfer cross section can be calculated by knowing only the optical potential in the entrance channel .",
    "it should be stressed that eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmacr ] ) assumes that the optical potential changes smoothly with the number of nucleons .",
    "therefore , one expects that this model for the form factor works better for heavy nuclei .",
    "the cross section for the reaction @xmath1o(t , p ) is calculated in the dwba approximation using the ecis88 code @xcite .",
    "the reaction energy is chosen to be 15 mev / a . for the optical potential corresponding to the system @xmath1o+t we use the potential derived by becchetti and greenlees @xcite .",
    "the parameters corresponding to this potential are summarized in table [ tab : bg ] .",
    "the @xmath62 parameter associated to a particular transfer mode is obtained by taking the average of the square root of the integral of the strength function over the energy region corresponding to that mode .",
    "the calculations are performed for the first two peaks located at 1.6 mev and 9.8 mev and for the broad resonant region located around 18 mev .",
    "the angular distribution corresponding to the state at 1.6 mev , displayed in figure [ fig : macrodis ] , is showing a typical diffraction pattern .",
    "for the other states the pattern of the angular distribution is the same . the only difference is in their magnitude , which depends on the @xmath62 value .",
    "table [ tab : sigmamacro ] shows the total cross - sections obtained for the three states mentioned above .",
    "the continuum treatment affects all the cross - section by 20% .",
    "one notices that the cross section for the broad resonant structure located around 18 mev is about 5 times larger than the cross section corresponding to the state at e=1.6 mev .",
    "bayman and kallio have proposed a method to calculate the form factor on a semi - microscopic ground . in this method",
    "the two - particle wave function of the transferred pair is expressed in term of the single - particle wave functions corresponding to a woods - saxon potential @xcite .",
    "the spectroscopic factors of the single - particle states are an input of the calculation .",
    "an example of such calculation for the form factor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : formfactbk ] .",
    "the calculation is for the configuration @xmath66 and for the @xmath1o+2n system .",
    "the woods - saxon potential was obtained by the separation energy method , where the depth of the potential is set in order to reproduce the binding energy of the single - particle to the core . the radius and the diffuseness of the potential",
    "were taken at the standard values of 1.25 fm and 0.65 fm , respectively .",
    "for the spectroscopic factor of the single - particle state we take the value 1 . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : formfactbk ] , the bayman and kallio form factor has also negative values .",
    "this is due to the fact that in this calculation the two neutrons are not considered at the same position in the two - neutron wave function .",
    "the previous @xmath1o+t becchetti and greenlees optical potential @xcite is used for the entrance channel and the @xmath1o+p becchetti and greenlees @xcite for the exit channel , in order to calculate the dwba cross - section .",
    "the resulting optical potential parameters are given in table [ tab : bg ] .",
    "the dwba calculations are performed with the dwuck4 @xcite code and using the zero - range approximation . in this approximation",
    "the two - neutrons and the residual fragment are located at the same point and the range function is expressed through a simple constant d@xmath57 @xcite . for the ( t , p )",
    "reaction we take d@xmath57 = 2.43 10@xmath67 mev@xmath55 @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "this value relies on measurements of the 2n+p system and may be subject to uncertainties @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution for the ( t , p ) reaction at e=15mev / a obtained with the bayman and kallio form factor is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : microdis ] . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the shape of the angular distribution is usually described correctly by the zero - range approximation , but not its magnitude , which is generally underestimated by a large amount .",
    "therefore in what follows we will focus our discussion not on the absolute values of the cross sections , but rather on the relative values obtained using different form factors .      in the nuclear response theory",
    "the transition from the ground state to the excited state @xmath69 of the same nucleus is determined by the transition density defined by :    @xmath70    where @xmath71 is the particle creation operator in coordinate space .",
    "the corresponding quantity for describing pair transfer processes is the pair transition density defined by :    @xmath72    where @xmath73= @xmath74 is its time reversed counterpart .",
    "the pair transition density defined above determines the transition from the ground state of a nuclei with a nucleons to a state @xmath69 of a nucleus with a+2 nucleons .",
    "this quantity is the output of cqrpa calculations .",
    "the form factor for the pair transfer is obtained by folding the pair transition density @xmath75 ( eq . ( [ eq : rhotildr ] ) ) with the interaction acting between the transferred pair and the residual fragment @xcite . in the zero - range approximation",
    "used here the dependence of this interaction on the relative distance between the pair and the fragment is taken as a delta force . therefore in this approximation the pair transition density ( [ eq : rhotildr ] ) coincides with the form factor @xcite .",
    "[ fig : formfactbk ] displays the pair transition density corresponding to the state around 2 mev in the @xmath1o+2n system .",
    "the dotted line represents the qrpa results while the dashed line shows the results derived from the * g@xmath57 * response , i.e. without taking into account the residual interaction between the quasiparticles .",
    "thus the dashed curve corresponds to a pair transferred in the pure two - quasiparticle configuration ( 2s@xmath58)@xmath55 . on the other hand the bayman and kallio form factor , shown by the full line , corresponds to the addition of a pair of neutrons in a pure two - particle configuration ( 2s@xmath58)@xmath55 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : formfactbk ] , the form factor derived from the * g@xmath57 * response has at large distances a smaller amplitude compared to the bayman and kallio form factor .",
    "this is due to the occupancy of the state 2s@xmath58 , which is different from zero in the case of the * g@xmath57 * response .",
    "another reason is that in the pair transition density given by ( [ eq : rhotildr ] ) the two neutrons are taken to be at the same position whereas in the bayman and kallio method the two neutrons are allowed to be at different positions . from fig .",
    "[ fig : formfactbk ] one can also see that the effect of the residual interaction is to increase the magnitude of the form factor , which is consistent with the increase of the strength shown in fig",
    ". 1 .    fig .",
    "[ fig : microdis ] displays the angular distributions for the reaction @xmath1o(t , p ) at 15 mev / a .",
    "the optical potential we have used in calculations is the same as above .",
    "the angular distributions are mainly sensitive to the surface part of the form factor , where the form factors calculated with the green s functions * g * and * g@xmath57 * show strong variations .",
    "the diffraction minima are shifted by 5 to 10 degrees between the two microscopic calculations . the angular distribution calculated with the bayman and kallio form factor drops faster with increasing angle .",
    "this is due to the spatial extension of the two transferred neutrons which produces the negative part of the form factor .    in order to see the continuum effect on the form factor , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fomrfactconti ] we display the transition densities calculated by solving the qrpa equations with continuum and box - type asymptotic conditions .",
    "the corresponding effect of the continuum treatment on the ( t , p ) angular distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : microdisconti ] . as expected , the effect is small for the transition towards the state located at 1.6 mev , built mainly upon bound qp states , and large for the state located at 9.8 mev , which is built mainly upon narrow resonant qp states . from fig . [",
    "fig : fomrfactconti ] we can see that the continuum treatment has also some effect on the form factor corresponding to the high energy mode around 18 mev , especially at small values of the nuclear radius .",
    "however its effect on the global cross section remains negligible , about 3% .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the pair transfer in neutron - rich oxygen isotopes in the framework of the continuum - qrpa .",
    "the form factors are calculated with a macroscopic model , the bayman and kallio approach , and fully microscopically .",
    "the cross section is evaluated by using the dwba and the zero - range approximation .",
    "the response function exhibits some narrow resonances corresponding to a pair transfer in the single - particle states of @xmath40 shell and a broad peak at high energies .",
    "this peak is built mainly upon the single - particle resonance @xmath41 and its cross section is much larger than the one associated to the lower energy transfer modes . since this high energy transfer mode is formed mainly by single - particle states above the valence shell , this mode is similar to the giant pairing vibration mode suggested long ago .",
    "although such a mode has not been detected yet , the pair transfer reactions involving exotic loosely bound nuclei may offer a better chance for this undertaking . on the theoretical side",
    ", one needs to make a better estimation for the absolute cross section associated to this mode . due to the collectivity of the final states the continuum treatment has also an impact on low - lying states .",
    "the form factors calculated microscopically show an effect of the continuum treatment on the form factor for high energy states .",
    "the angular distributions are mainly affected in their diffraction minima for narrow high energy states . in the case of the gpv , no drastic influence of the exact continuum treatment is observed .",
    "it should be interesting to perform the dwba calculations without the zero - range approximation in order to make more quantitative predictions for the cross section .",
    "this requires to fold the pair transition densities with the interaction between the two neutrons and the residual fragment .      *",
