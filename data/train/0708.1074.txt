    "influence of high porosity aerogel on superfluid phases of @xmath0 phenomenologically can be described by the extra term in the free energy functional : @xmath1,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the density of states on fermi level , @xmath3 is the order parameter of the superfluid @xmath0 , @xmath4 is a real symmetric random tensor ; it describes a local anisotropy .",
    "small changes of physical properties of superfluid @xmath0 brought about by aerogel can be expressed in terms of the ensemble average of the random tensor @xmath5 and of a correlation function @xmath6 @xmath7 .",
    "the isotropic part of the average tensor @xmath8 determines the suppression of temperature of superfluid transition by aerogel .",
    "and its anisotropic part @xmath9 describes orientational effect of a global anisotropy on the order parameter . in case of the abm - order parameter @xmath10 orientational energy @xmath11 @xmath12 , where @xmath13 . for evaluation of the mentioned averages aerogel",
    "can be envisioned as an array of randomly oriented threads of a diameter @xmath14 nm .",
    "this diameter fits in the interval @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the interatomic distance and @xmath17 is the correlation length for superfluid @xmath0 .",
    "this condition allows to consider threads of aerogel as `` small objects '' and apply the theory of rainer and vuorio @xcite .",
    "volovik @xcite used results of this theory and a simple model of aerogel for order of magnitude estimation of the effect of deformation on a state of the a - like phase .",
    "this estimation is very sensitive to a choice of parameters characterizing the system . in an attempt to make the estimation less ambiguous using the same model we made here explicit calculations of @xmath18 in case of a small uniaxial deformation of aerogel .",
    "we found also the long - wavelength limit of fourier - image of the correlation function for a non - deformed aerogel .",
    "we assume that aerogel consists of straight pieces of thread with the length of @xmath19 homogeneously distributed over the volume .",
    "threads have circular section with radius @xmath20 .",
    "orientational distribution of threads is described by the distribution function @xmath21 , which is equal to the number of threads in a unit volume having direction @xmath22 . for a non - deformed aerogel this function",
    "is isotropic : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is aerogel porosity .",
    "uniaxial deformation of aerogel can be described as a transformation of coordinates @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 . where @xmath28 is deformation in @xmath29-direction and positive sign of @xmath30 corresponds to the stretching along @xmath29-direction .",
    "after this transformation function @xmath21 takes the form : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the angle between @xmath33-axis and direction @xmath22 .    according to the rainer and vuorio theory a small object gives rise to additional term in the free energy : @xmath34 the kernel @xmath35 has a form : @xmath36,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , @xmath38 is coordinate of the object , @xmath39 , @xmath40  differential and total cross - section of the scattering quasiparticles by the object , respectively .",
    "knowing @xmath35 one can obtain @xmath41 as @xcite : @xmath42 for application of eq.([kernel ] ) to the piece of thread with the length @xmath43 it should be divided on elements with the length @xmath44 .",
    "if one introduces average distance between the threads @xmath45 then perturbation of the order parameter produced by a single element at a distance of the order of @xmath45 is small as @xmath46 .",
    "the result for the whole piece of thread in a principal order on @xmath47 can be found as a sum of contributions from all elements provided that this sum remains small correction to the non - perturbed order parameter .",
    "condition of smallness can be violated in a vicinity of a thread , but contribution of this region to the integral ( [ etta ] ) is of the order of @xmath48 and therefore does not introduce considerable error .",
    "contribution to @xmath49 from all threads in a principal order on their concentration is found by summation of contributions from each piece of thread .",
    "cross - sections @xmath39 and @xmath40 entering eq.([kernel ] ) depend on character of quasiparticle scattering by the threads .",
    "we consider diffusive and specular scattering as two extreme cases .",
    "let us introduce a frame of references as shown in a fig.([frame ] ) . in this frame differential cross - section of a quasiparticle by an element of the thread @xmath50 at the diffusive scattering has the form : @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "then for the total cross - section we have : @xmath54 substitution of these expressions into eqns.([kernel ] , [ etta ] ) and integration over @xmath50 yields the following expression for the contribution from a single thread @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the perpendicular from the point of observation to the thread or its continuation , @xmath22 and @xmath58 - unit vectors along the thread and along @xmath57 respectively . functions @xmath59 and @xmath60 are given by the following expressions : @xmath61d\\zeta,\\\\ \\eta^{1}_{z}(\\textbf{r})=-\\int_{h/2\\xi_0-\\varepsilon/4\\xi_0}^{h/2\\xi_0+\\varepsilon/4\\xi_0 } \\frac{1}{2\\pi } \\frac{\\rho}{\\xi_0}\\cdot\\frac{\\alpha \\zeta^2}{(\\zeta^2+\\alpha^2)^{5/2}}\\ln\\left(\\tanh(\\zeta^2+\\alpha^2)^{1/2}\\right)d\\zeta,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 , @xmath63 is a distance from the center of the thread to the plane of observation .",
    "contribution from all threads is : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a number of the thread . as a result of averaging one arrives at the isotropic part of tensor @xmath41 : @xmath66 anisotropic part for a uniaxial deformation",
    "can be written as : @xmath67 coefficients in eqns.([iso],[ani ] ) are expressed in terms of the integrals : @xmath68 numerical evaluation of these integrals shows that at @xmath69 the answer does not practically depend on @xmath19 . for @xmath43 one can take values of @xmath70 and @xmath71 obtained in a limit @xmath72 , when they can be evaluated analytically @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "then @xmath75 corrections to the order parameter brought up by fluctuations are expressed in terms of the fourier - image of correlation function at @xmath76 , i.e. @xmath77 @xcite . from symmetry considerations it can be written as : @xmath78 the calculations analogous to that made when finding @xmath79 yield the following expression for @xmath80 : @xmath81 for diffusive scattering , using for @xmath82 and @xmath83 their values for infinite threads we have : @xmath84 for specular boundary conditions differential cross - section has the form : @xmath85 repeating with this cross - sections all calculations one arrives at @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) : @xmath89 i.e. in comparison with diffusive scattering anisotropic part of tensor @xmath79 is approximately at @xmath90 times greater . for correlation function in the case of specular scattering",
    "the answer is : @xmath91",
    "the considered model gives for orientational energy of the order parameter of the abm - phase in a uniaxially deformed aerogel @xmath92 in the case of diffusive scattering and @xmath93 for specular reflection .",
    "effect of anisotropy is greater for the specular reflection , but in both cases the energy @xmath94 is one - two orders of magnitude smaller than the simple order of magnitude estimation cf.@xcite",
    ". even greater difference occurs for the borderline deformation @xmath95 separating the state of the ordered abm - phase from the state with the critical fluctuations .",
    "transition between the two states is expected when the fluctuational corrections to the equation , determining a form of the order parameter become comparable with @xmath96 . according to @xcite that happens when @xmath97 .",
    "using for @xmath80 and @xmath98 expressions ( [ ani1 ] ) , ( [ phi0d ] ) we have for the diffusive scattering : @xmath99 if we assume that @xmath100 and substitute for @xmath101 nm and @xmath102 nm , then @xmath103 . with the expressions ( [ anis ] ) , ( [ phi0s ] ) and the same values of parameters for the specular reflection : @xmath104 specular scattering renders higher limit for @xmath95 , but even in this case it is about two orders of magnitude smaller than the simple estimation @xcite .",
    "present calculations are based on a simple model , so we can not claim that the obtained results describe effect of the aerogel on superfluid @xmath0 quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless the observed suppression of the effect of anisotropy is hardly an artifact of the model .",
