    "+ before each breakdown experiment , the scanner glass was treated with a hydrophobic solution containing teflon . because of this treatment of the glass surface , the contact angle of the liquid onto the glass was close to 90 degrees , so that the droplets turned out to be very similar in shape to semi - spheres . after the fragmentation , a thin spacing was inserted between the scanner lid and its glass window , and a high - resolution ( 600 dpi ) scan was performed .",
    "several ( from 10 to 50 ) fragmentation experiments were carried out varying the jet pressure p , from 11 psi to 100 psi .",
    "the number of droplets obtained varied , from a few ones at 11 psi to tens of thousands at 100 psi .",

    "+        recently there have been suggestions that brittle fragmentation  @xcite and nmf  @xcite experiments can be rationalized in the context of a percolative  @xcite phase transition .",
    "the validity of such interpretations rests , to a great extent , upon the identification of a relevant order parameter which has the properties of the infinite - cluster density in percolation . within this picture ,",
    "the connected or percolating phase must be characterized by the existence of macroscopic fragments , while no such fragments must exist in the disconnected phase ( at large breakdown energies ) .",
    "the average size of the largest fragment , which goes to zero _ abruptly _ at the critical energy , plays the role of an order parameter in brittle fragmentation  @xcite , so it is natural to first consider the largest droplet size as a tentative order parameter also in the case of our experiments .",

    "[ fig : holianpred ] from our droplet fragmentation experiments .",
    "it turns out that @xmath80 has a smooth pressure dependence of the type @xmath81 , without any traces of a singular behavior .",
    "notice that , if there where a percolative transition , the mass of the largest droplet ( the infinite cluster ) should go to zero at the critical point . therefore we conclude that the behavior of @xmath79 does not support the existence of a percolative transition in this system .      in his discussion of nmf experiments , campi  @xcite notices that correlations among some moments of the size distribution are similar to those found in percolation .",
    "in particular , a plot is presented of @xmath79 versus @xmath82 ( moments are calculated excluding the contribution of the largest cluster ) and it is argued that the rounded `` nose '' of events with large values of @xmath83 corresponds to the percolative `` critical region ''",

    "[ fig : zmaxvss2 ] shows a scatter plot of @xmath79 , the largest cluster s mass , versus @xmath83 , for each fragmentation event in our experiments .",
    "this plot is similar in many aspects to the one considered by campi  @xcite , in particular with respect to the existence of a `` nose '' of events with large values of @xmath83 .",
    "it can be easily seen , however , that this feature by itself is not indicative of critical behavior . in order to see this , consider the breakup of a droplet of unitary volume into an infinite succession of droplets @xmath84 of volume @xmath85 , for @xmath86 .",
    "as @xmath87 goes from almost zero to almost one , the resulting size distribution changes from being dominated by essentially one large drop , to being composed of a `` mist '' of tiny droplets .",
    "clearly there is no phase transition in this system .",
    "+ for this simple partition , the largest mass is @xmath88 .",
    "furthermore , it is straightforward to show that @xmath89 . a plot of @xmath90 for this simple partition is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : zmaxvss2 ] ( thick line ) .",
    "it can be seen that its overall features are the same as reported by campi  @xcite , i.e. @xmath83 goes through a maximum and then decreases , as @xmath79 decreases ( @xmath87 increases ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the rounded `` nose '' in these plots is not by itself indicative of a phase transition , and can not be taken as evidence of percolative behavior .",
    "recently ashurst and holian ( ah )  @xcite ( see also strom , holian and timonen @xcite ) , considering a @xmath91-dimensional fluid system that expands uniformly at rate @xmath92 , predicted that the _ maximum _ droplet size @xmath79 should behave as @xmath93 while the _ average _ droplet size @xmath94 should decrease as @xmath95 with increasing expansion rate   but the _ mass average _ @xmath96 . ] .",
    "+ since in our experiments the expansion rate @xmath92 is not a control parameter , the applicability of ah results is not obvious .",
    "however we find ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : holianpred ] ) that @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which is consistent with ah predictions in 3 dimensions , if the ( unknown ) expansion rate @xmath92 is _ assumed _ to be proportional to the jet pressure @xmath51 .",
    "we now set to try and identify the nature of the phase transition at @xmath99 psi , by defining a useful order parameter that we call _ dominance probability_. although , as seen already , the largest fragment size is a smooth function of @xmath51 , we have noticed that , at low pressures , most of the mass is concentrated in a few large fragments , while at larger pressures the mass is evenly distributed among a large number of small droplets .",
    "more precisely , at very low pressures the mass distribution appears to be composed of one large fragment plus many tiny droplets . upon increasing the jet pressure @xmath51 ,",
    "often two large droplets appear , next events with three large fragments become prevalent , and so on . at large enough pressures , however , the original droplet mass is more evenly distributed among a large number of droplets , without a clear size distinction between large and small ones .",
    "we then seek to define an order parameter that quantifies the property that the mass distribution be `` dominated '' by a few large fragments or not .",
    "+ for an arbitrarily defined `` dominance factor '' @xmath100",
    "taking values slightly smaller than 1 ( one can take e.g.  @xmath101 to exemplify the ideas ) , we say that there is _ dominance _ at level 1 if the largest fragment s mass is larger than @xmath100 times the total mass . if this condition is not satisfied , the largest fragment is removed and we check whether the second largest fragment s mass is larger than @xmath100 times the total remaining mass ( after removing the first largest ) .",
    "if this is the case , we say that there is dominance at level 2 . if not , the second largest droplet is removed and we proceed to do the same check with the third largest one , and so forth , until only the last droplet remains . + these ideas",
    "can be formalized as follows .",
    "first all droplets in a given fragmentation event are ordered by size : @xmath102 .",

    "if ( [ eq:3 ] ) is not satisfied for any @xmath109 then we say that there is no dominance .",
    "+    whenever there is dominance at level @xmath106 , the first @xmath106 drops are substantially larger than all of the remaining ones .",
    "this means that the mass distribution can be separated in two components : one made of @xmath106 massive drops , the other constituted by one or more ( usually many ) tiny droplets .",
    "if on the other hand condition ( [ eq:3 ] ) is never satisfied , it is said that there is no dominance and this means that the distribution has no distinguishable size scale .",
    "+ in nmf , events where the excited nucleus emits a few small fragments composed of one or two nuclei , remaining otherwise almost unaltered , are called _ evaporation _ events .",
    "those events where the original nucleus splits into two large fragments ( plus eventually a few much smaller ones ) are called _ fission _ events , and those for which three large fragments are formed are called _ ternary fission _ events . within the dominance concept",
    "we have introduced , the nmf classification mentioned above corresponds to @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "+ in order to apply these ideas to our experimental data , for each pressure @xmath51 we determine the probability @xmath112 that there is dominance at level @xmath106 , by averaging over fragmentation events ( typically fifty ) at pressure @xmath51 .",
    "the resulting dominance probabilities are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : dominance ] for several values of @xmath106 .",
    "it is apparent from these data that evaporation ( @xmath113 ) events are predominant at low pressure , next fission ( @xmath114 ) events appear as @xmath51 is increased , followed by a predominance of ternary fission(@xmath115 ) and so forth . as shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : dominance ] , together with the average mass @xmath119 of all dominant droplets .",
    "the fact that @xmath119 is roughly equivalent to @xmath118 indicates that , whenever there is dominance , almost the total mass of the system is contained in the @xmath106 dominant drops .",
    "the total dominance probability @xmath118 goes to zero at around @xmath120 , in a way that is consistent with all previously mentioned evidence indicating a critical point around that pressure .",
    "of course the precise numerical values of the dominance observables @xmath117 depend on the arbitrary choice of the dominance parameter @xmath100 , but we have checked that the fact that the dominance probability goes to zero around @xmath121 psi holds qualitatively unaltered for @xmath100 ranging from @xmath122 to @xmath123 .",
    "we also explored a different definition of dominance , namely replacing ( [ eq:3 ] ) with @xmath124 this means that a comparison is established between each mass - sorted droplet and the next , stopping at the first level at which the ratio between them is larger than a given prespecified factor .",
    "the use of definition ( [ eq : otherdom ] ) instead of ( [ eq:3 ] ) did not alter our findings qualitatively .",
    "+ we thus feel justified to conclude , based on the data presented in this section , that there is a _ dominance transition _ in the neighborhood of @xmath125  psi . on the low - pressure side of this transition ,",
    "a few large ( dominant ) drops contain most of the original mass , and there is a size - gap separating these large drops from the accompanying `` mist '' of tiny droplets . beyond @xmath6 , on the other hand , one has a collection of droplets which populate homogeneously the whole range of sizes without a systematic size gap .",

    "of course the precise value of @xmath6 is not interesting by itself , since it will depend upon many parameters like the volume and viscosity of the original droplet , the amount of gas contained in the pressurized chamber , the diameter of the outlet ( and thus the exhaust velocity ) , etc , whose variation we did not consider in this experiment .",
    "conceptually more interesting is the fact that , as the energy available to break the droplet increases , a sharp transition occurs between two breakdown regimes , and that this transition can be characterized by statistical methods as discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "+ future work could include the use of fast imaging techniques in order to put these results in the context of what is known about rupture modes in the field of sprays  @xcite .",
    "the following picture emerges for isolated droplets subject to a sudden gas blow . at low excitation intensity ( low weber number )",
    "the prevalent rupture mechanism is vibrational breakup , whereby collective oscillations break the drop into a small number of roughly equal - sized droplets . upon increasing the breakdown energy",
    ", bag breakup appears , which is characterized by the deformation of the drop into a torus - shaped rim , which subsequently disintegrates .",
    "a variant of this is called bag - and - stamen breakup , in which a central `` stamen '' is also formed .",
    "next come shear breakup , where small droplets are continuously stripped off the rim of the drop , and catastrophic breakup , where strong surface waves disintegrate the drop violently .",
    "the limit weber number between vibrational and bag breakup is around 10 . at 20 - 60",
    "shear breakup appears , and at 1000 catastrophic breakup .",
    "+ since our experiments were conducted on droplets hanging from a thin glass tip , the presence of which certainly modifies the gas flow and the ensuing breakup modes , we do not expect a direct correspondence with the above classification , although a comparison with the rupture modes of free droplets would certainly be instructive .",
    "+ also interesting is to establish a comparison of our results with recent analyses of nmf data in the context of phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "common characteristics are : a sharp minimum in the apparent @xmath0 exponent  @xcite , a strong curvature change in a log - log plot of @xmath7@xcite , and the fact that @xmath7 is , to a good approximation , a pure power law at criticality  @xcite ."
