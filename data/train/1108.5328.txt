    "transport excited by radiation in a two - dimensional electron system ( 2des ) is currently a central topic from experimental and theoretical standpoints@xcite .",
    "the interest is focussed not only on the basic explanation of a physical effect but also on its potential applications . in the last decade",
    "it was discovered that when a hall bar ( a 2des with a uniform and perpendicular magnetic field ( @xmath0 ) ) is irradiated with microwaves , some unexpected effects are revealed , deserving special attention from the condensed matter community : microwave - induced ( mw ) resistance oscillations ( miro ) and zero resistance states ( zrs ) @xcite .",
    "these remarkable effects show up at low @xmath0 and high mobility samples , specially zrs where ultraclean samples are needed .",
    "different theories have been proposed to explain these striking effects @xcite but the physical origin is still being questioned . to shed some light on the physics behind them ,",
    "a great effort has been made , specially from the experimental side , growing better samples , adding new features and different probes to the basic experimental setup , etc.@xcite .",
    "of course the experimental results always mean a real challenge for the existent theoretical models .",
    "thus , a comparison of experiment with theory could help to identify the importance of the invoked - mechanisms in these theories .",
    "one of the most interesting setups , carried out recently , consists in using samples with two or three occupied subbands@xcite .",
    "these samples are either based in a double quantum well structure or just one single but wide quantum well .",
    "the main difference in the longitudinal magnetoresistance ( @xmath1 ) of a two - subband sample is the presence of magneto - intersubband oscillations ( miso)@xcite .",
    "these oscillations occur due to periodic modulation of the probability of transitions through elastic scattering between landau levels ( ll ) of different subband .",
    "the miso peaks corresponds to the subband alignment condition @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the subband separation and @xmath4 the cyclotron frequency .",
    "because of elastic scattering of electrons between ll of different subband , the probability rate is maximal under this condition . under mw irradiation",
    "the first experimental results@xcite of @xmath1 showed the interference of miso and miro without reaching the zrs regime .",
    "later on , further experiments realized at higher mw intensities and mobility samples , showed the mw - response to evolve into zero resistance states for the first time in a two occupied subband sample@xcite .",
    "in the same experiment@xcite it was also observed a peculiar @xmath1 profile with different features , regarding the one - subband case @xcite , affecting only valleys and peaks of miro s in a surprising regular way .",
    "thus , in valleys we observe two nearly symmetric shoulders , one at each side of minimum which could correspond to a more intense transport through the sample . on the other hand , in the peaks we observe narrower profiles , regarding again the one subband case , meaning a smaller transport .",
    "= 3.in = 3.4 in    in this article , we theoretically study magnetoresistance of a hall bar being illuminated with mw radiation when two electronic subbands participate in the transport .",
    "we apply the theory developed by the authors , _ the mw - driven electron orbits model_@xcite , which we extend to a two - subband scenario . according to this theory ,",
    "when a hall bar is illuminated , the electron orbit centers of the landau states perform a classical trajectory consisting in a harmonic motion along the direction of the current . thus , the 2des moves periodically at the mw frequency altering dramatically the scattering conditions and giving rise eventually to miro and zrs . in some cases",
    "the transport is reinforced producing mw - induced @xmath1 peaks ; in others , transport is weakened giving rise to valleys . in a double subband scenario",
    "the situation gets more complicated but with a richer physics .",
    "on the one hand , due to the presence of mw , we have two 2des ( twoo subbands ) moving harmonically at the mw - frequency .",
    "on the other hand , we have two possible scattering processes with charged impurities : intra and inter - subband .",
    "we then calculate the two corresponding elastic impurity scattering rates , obtaining that the intra is , approximately , three times larger than the inter .",
    "this means first , that the current is mainly supported by intra - subband scattering processes . secondly and more important , the competition between intra and inter - subband scattering events under the presence of radiation alters significantly the transport properties of the sample .",
    "this is reflected in the @xmath1 profile through a strong and peculiar interference effect .",
    "as in experiments , our calculated results recover the presence of new features regularly spaced through the whole miro s profile , mainly two shoulders at minima and narrower peaks .",
    "we identify such features with situations where the interference is constructive and the current is reinforced ( shoulders around minima ) meanwhile in other cases the interference is destructive giving rise to a less intense current ( thinner peaks ) . within the same theory ,",
    "we have obtained also zrs in the same position of experiments and with the same mw - frequency dependence .",
    "finally , we have studied the influence of mw - frequency ( @xmath5 ) , mw - power ( @xmath6 ) and temperature ( @xmath7 ) on miro s of the two subband sample and the obtained results are also in reasonable agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "the _ mw driven electron orbits model _ , was developed to explain the @xmath1 response of an irradiated 2deg at low @xmath0 .",
    "we first obtain an exact expression of the electronic wave vector for a 2des in a perpendicular @xmath0 , a dc electric field and mw radiation which is considered semi - classically .",
    "then , the total hamiltonian @xmath8 can be written as : @xmath9 @xmath10 is the center of the orbit for the electron spiral motion : @xmath11 @xmath12 the intensity for the mw field and @xmath13 is the dc electric field in the @xmath14 direction .",
    "@xmath15 is the hamiltonian corresponding to a forced harmonic oscillator whose orbit is centered at @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath15 can be solved exactly @xcite , and using this result allows an exact solution for the electronic wave function of @xmath8 to be obtained@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the solution for the schrdinger equation of the unforced quantum harmonic oscillator , @xmath18 is the classical solution of a forced and damped harmonic oscillator @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a phenomenologically - introduced damping factor for the electronic interaction with acoustic phonons .",
    "= 3.5 in = 3.5 in    then , the obtained wave function is the same as the standard harmonic oscillator where the center is displaced by @xmath18 .",
    "thus , the electron orbit centers are not fixed , but they oscillate harmonically at @xmath5 .",
    "this @xmath21 behavior will affect dramatically the charged impurity scattering and eventually the conductivity .",
    "thus , we introduce the scattering suffered by the electrons due to charged impurities .",
    "if the scattering is weak , we can apply time dependent first order perturbation theory .",
    "first , we calculate the impurity scattering rate@xcite between two @xmath22 landau states @xmath23 , final state @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the scattering potential for charged impurities@xcite : @xmath27 @xmath28 being the surface of the sample , @xmath29 the gaas dielectric constant , and @xmath30 is the thomas - fermi screening constant@xcite .",
    "after some lengthy algebra we arrive at the expressions for the intra - subband @xmath31 and the inter - subband @xmath32 scattering rates : @xmath33\\ ] ] + @xmath34\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath35 is the density of impurities , @xmath36 the width of the landau states , @xmath37 the subband separation and @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the form factors . to obtain the form factor expressions",
    "we have considered , as in experiments@xcite , a highly doped wide quantum well with @xmath40 . in this type of wells , as more electrons are added , their electrostatic repulsion forces them to pile up near the well sides and the resulting electron charge distribution appears increasingly as bilayer ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . in other words , and",
    "effective electrostatic barrier is built up in the middle of the well separating the two electron layers in gaas . in the case of a double quantum dot",
    "the barrier is made of algaas or alas .",
    "as a result we obtain at each side of the wide quantum well a potential profile similar to the inversion layer of a 2des that , in a good approximation , can be considered triangular close to the heterojunctions ( see fig .",
    "next , we have to obtain first the corresponding wave functions of these triangular - like built - in potential profiles .",
    "then , due to its great simplicity and as a first approach , we have applied the fang - howard variational treatment ( see ref.@xcite ) that proposes as electronic wave function ( fang - howard wave function ) : @xmath41^{1/2 } z   e^{-\\frac{1}{2}bz},\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the corresponding fang - howard variational parameter . according to this simple but efficient approach , @xmath42 results to be mainly dependent on the two - dimensional charged impurity density@xcite . now starting from this variational wave function",
    "we can build @xmath43 which are the corresponding symmetric ( antisymmetric ) wave function of the wide quantum well(see fig .",
    "1 ) . finally the form factors are obtained :    = 3.5 in = 5.0 in    @xmath44\\ ] ]    @xmath45\\ ] ]    where @xmath46 is the electron wave vector exchanged in the scattering .",
    "we have supposed a symmetrical delta doping , being @xmath47 the average separation between the impurities and the 2des at each side of the wide quantum well , i.e. , spacer distance .",
    "this distance depends on the sample . in practical terms",
    "it varies between @xmath48 to even larger than @xmath49 . in our calculations",
    "we have used a numerical value of @xmath50 . according to the fang - howad variational approach@xcite , where the parameter @xmath42 is given by : @xmath51^{1/3}\\ ] ] , and applying the experimental sample parameters@xcite , we have calculated a numerical value for @xmath52 .",
    "consequently the average thickness of the triangular wells @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is related with @xmath42 by @xmath55 .",
    "following again with the experimental parameters at hand@xcite in terms of impurity density , well thickness , etc . , we have made an averaged estimation of the relative values of @xmath38 and @xmath39 resulting in @xmath56 where we have used an average value for @xmath57 that is of the order of the fermi wave vector in agreement with the experimental impurity density . substituting the obtained form factors in the scattering rates we can eventually reach averaged values for those rates that result to be related by : @xmath58 here",
    "we have considered that the cosine average value , @xmath59 for @xmath60 and we have carried out the sum @xmath61 .",
    "once we know the intra and inter - subband scattering rates , we consider that when an electron undergoes a scattering process jumping from the initial state to the final one , it takes an average time @xmath62 following the model described in ref.@xcite , we next find the average effective distance advanced by the electron in every scattering jump in the presence of radiation @xmath63 , generalizing the previous results to a two subbands scenario : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the effective distance advanced when there is no mw field present . applying the important previous result of @xmath66 we can write the final expression for the total average distance advance due to both kinds of scattering , intra and inter , @xmath67 : @xmath68 + a\\cos \\left[w\\langle\\tau_{inter}\\rangle\\right]\\\\ & = & a\\cos\\left[\\frac{w}{3}\\langle\\tau_{inter}\\rangle\\right]+ a\\cos \\left[w\\langle\\tau_{inter}\\rangle\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this significantly alters the scattering conditions regarding the one - subband case mainly affecting miro s peaks and valleys .",
    "= 3.5 in = 5.0 in    finally the contributions intra and inter - subband to the longitudinal conductivity can be calculated : @xmath69(f_{i}-f_{f})$ ] , being @xmath70 and @xmath71 the corresponding distribution functions for the initial and final landau states respectively and @xmath72 energy .",
    "the obtained final expression for the conductivity is given by :    @xmath73^{2 } \\left[1 + 2e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}}+e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma } { \\hbar w_{c}}}\\frac{x_{s}}{\\sinh x_{s}}\\left(\\cos\\frac{2\\pi(e_{f}-e_{1})}{\\hbar w_{c}}+\\cos \\frac{2\\pi(e_{f}-e_{2})}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{2e^{7}m^{*2}b n_{i}s}{\\pi\\epsilon^{2}\\hbar ^{6}q_{0}}\\left[\\delta x^{0}+ a\\cos w\\langle\\tau_{inter}\\rangle \\right]^{2 } \\left[1 + 2e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma}{\\hbar w_{c}}}\\cos\\frac{2\\pi\\delta_{12}}{\\hbar w_{c}}+e^{\\frac{-\\pi\\gamma } { \\hbar w_{c}}}\\frac{x_{s}}{\\sinh x_{s}}\\left(\\cos\\frac{2\\pi(e_{f}-e_{1})}{\\hbar w_{c}}+\\cos\\frac{2\\pi(e_{f}-e_{2})}{\\hbar w_{c}}\\right)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    = 3.5 in = 5.0 in    = 3.5 in = 5.0 in    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 and @xmath76 are the energies of the first and the second subband respectively . finally , to obtain @xmath1 we use the relation @xmath77 , where @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "the expression of the conductivity @xmath80 shows the physical equivalence to a situation with only one scattering time and two different oscillations frequencies for the mw - driven subbands : @xmath81 for the intra - band scattering and @xmath5 for the inter .",
    "they demonstrate also the origin for the regular and strong interference profile observed in experiments where the factor @xmath82 is essential to obtain the interference effect . a different factor would produce a totally distinct interference and also distinct @xmath1 response .",
    "this factor comes from the calculation of the squared magnitude of the corresponding form factors @xmath83 and @xmath83 which eventually determine the different scattering rate between the intra - subband and the inter - one processes .",
    "these form factors depend mainly on the variational parameter @xmath42 and on the averaged wave vector @xmath84 which subsequently are determined by two - dimensional impurity density @xmath35 .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the crucial parameter @xmath82 and eventually the obtained interference profile will be mainly dependent on @xmath35 . during the scattering jump",
    "the electron _ perceives _ an approximately three times faster mw - driven oscillation of the 2des when is inter - subband with respect to the intra - subband .",
    "this equation reflects also the important result that the intra - band conductivity ( upper term in the @xmath80 expression ) is three times larger than the inter - subband ( lower term of @xmath80 ) .",
    "then , the total current is mainly supported by intra - subband scattering processes regarding the inter processes in a relation of approximately three to one .    based in these results",
    ", we can explain physically how the interference between both types of scattering process work , producing an excess of current at minima and a lack of current at maxima . in fig .",
    "2 we present schematic diagrams for the different situations . in all of them",
    "the mw field is on and the electronic orbits are not fixed , and instead move back and forth through @xmath85 . in fig .",
    "2a , the intra - subband scattering corresponds to a peak and the orbits moves backwards during the jump , then on average , electrons advance further than in the no mw case .",
    "thus , we obtain more current giving rise to peaks because the average advanced distance is directly proportional to the conductivity . yet , according to our calculations , only three out of four of the total scattering processes take place through the intra - subband channel . the other one out of four are inter - subband processes ( see fig .",
    "2b ) . in them ,",
    "due to the slower scattering time ( or higher @xmath5 ) the scattering jump occurs when the electronic orbits are moving forward . therefore , the average advanced distance is smaller than in the intra processes . eventually at the peaks , the total advanced distance , @xmath86 , is smaller than the one - subband case .",
    "accordingly , this is directly translated to the obtained current , being reflected in the narrower peaks profile ( see fig .",
    "the valleys situation can be explained in similar terms as the peaks .",
    "now , in the intra processes ( see fig .",
    "2c ) the scattering jump takes place when the electronic orbits are moving forward giving a smaller electronic advanced distance and current .",
    "this situation gives rise to valleys and eventually if the mw power is big enough the zrs can be achieved . as before , these intra - subband scattering processes correspond to three out of four of the total ( see fig . 2c ) .",
    "the other one out of four develops through the inter - subband channel ( see fig .",
    "2d ) . in these processes ,",
    "again due to the smaller scattering time or higher @xmath5 , the scattering jump occurs when the electronic orbits are going backwards giving rise to a larger average advanced distance and current ( see fig .",
    "then , summing up all scattering processes we obtain more current than the one - subband case .",
    "this is the physical origin of the two shoulder that can be observed a both sides at minima of @xmath1 versus @xmath42 .",
    "in fig . 3a , we present calculated @xmath1 vs @xmath0 for dark and mw situations and frequency @xmath87 ghz . we can observe miso for the no - mw curve , miro for the mw curve and the zrs marked with and arrow . in fig .",
    "3b , we present the same as in 3a , but for @xmath88-subbands and @xmath89-subband cases . the later has been obtained making @xmath90 .",
    "contrasting both curves we observe the new features appearing regularly spaced in peaks and valleys : two nearly symmetric shoulders in valleys and narrower peaks regarding the @xmath89-subband curve . according to our model ,",
    "these new features are result of the interference between the competing intra and inter - subband scattering processes .",
    "this interference effect is mainly based in the different scattering rates between intra and inter - subband scattering events . on the one hand this is going to be obviously reflected in the different scattering times :",
    "the inter process is three times smaller than the intra - subband . on the other hand , in the different capability to support the current .",
    "the intra - subband processes are able to support three times more current than the inter .",
    "thus , in valleys , we observe a constructive interference effect giving rise to two shoulders meaning more current through the sample , meanwhile the narrower peaks mean a destructive interference and less current .",
    "the presence of zrs is explained similarly as in ref.@xcite . in fig.4",
    "we present calculated @xmath1 vs @xmath0 for different mw frequencies . in 4a , for a lower frequencies range ( from @xmath91 to @xmath92 ghz)@xcite and in 4b , for a higher frequencies range ( from @xmath93 to @xmath94 ghz)@xcite .",
    "we observe in all cases the presence of zrs with shifting position depending on @xmath95 and with reasonable agreement with experiment .",
    "all curves present the peaks and valley features meaning the importance of the interference effect which shows up independently of @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath95-dependence of zrs positions was previously and similarly observed in one - subband samples@xcite .    in fig .",
    "5a we present @xmath6-dependence of @xmath1 vs @xmath0 for @xmath96 ghz .",
    "we observe that miro s decrease as @xmath6 , ( and @xmath12 ) , gets smaller from @xmath97 mw to darkness in similar behavior as the @xmath89-subband results@xcite . in 5b",
    ", we present @xmath98 vs @xmath6 , for data coming from peaks ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of fig . 5a , where @xmath99 is the magnetoresistance for darkness and @xmath100 is the magnetoresistance when the mw field is on .",
    "we fit the data obtaining for both peaks a sublinear @xmath6-dependence , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and explained in terms of : @xmath103 and in agreement with current@xcite and previous experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite results .    in fig 6a .",
    "we present the @xmath7 dependence of @xmath1 vs @xmath0 for @xmath96 ghz . as in @xmath89-subband samples ,",
    "we observe a clear decrease of miro for increasing @xmath7 , eventually reaching a @xmath1 response similar to darkness . in fig .",
    "6b , we present @xmath104 vs @xmath105 for data coming from peaks ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of fig .",
    "the @xmath7-dependence , according to the model , is explained with the damping parameter @xmath20 which represents the interaction of electrons with acoustic phonons .",
    "@xmath20 is linear with @xmath7@xcite , thus an increasing @xmath7 means an increasing @xmath20 and smaller miro s .",
    "when the damping is strong enough ( higher @xmath7 ) miro s collapse .",
    "the curves of fig .",
    "6b show the relation @xmath106 in agreement with experiment@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have theoretically studied the recently discovered microwave - induced resistance oscillations and zero resistance states in hall bars with two occupied subbands .",
    "mw - driven magnetoresistance presents a peculiar shape which appears to have a built - in interference effect not observed before . applying the microwave - driven electron orbit model ,",
    "we calculate different intra and inter - subband electron scattering rates under mw , revealing that the first is three times greater than the latter .",
    "this is physically equivalent to different microwave - driven oscillations frequencies for the two electronic subbands . through scattering ,",
    "these subband - dependent oscillation motions interfere giving rise to such a striking resistance profile . in the valleys",
    "the interference is constructive giving rise to two symmetric extra shoulders at each side of minima .",
    "in the peaks the interference is destructive producing smaller peaks regarding the one - subband case .",
    "the factor @xmath107 is essential to obtain this strong and regularly spaced interference effect .",
    "we study also the dependence on mw frequency , mw intensity and temperature .",
    "calculated results are in good agreement with experiments . +   +",
