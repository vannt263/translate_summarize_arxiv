    "polarised radio emission is fundamentally related to the presence of magnetic fields , and observations of polarisation are the best way of directly studying quasi - regular fields ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a key issue for polarimetry of astrophysical sources is removal of effects that alter the properties of the radiation as it propagates across the universe and through the various components of a radio telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ` full - polarisation ' mode of the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt )  which provides observations of all four cross - correlation products i.e.  @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4  has recently become available at 610  mhz .",
    "the properties of faint polarised sources at frequencies @xmath5  ghz are relatively poorly constrained by observations , despite this being the region where faraday depolarisation effects are expected to dominate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "measurements of polarised emission require a combination of high sensitivity to probe the weak polarised signals at these frequencies , together with consideration of the numerous systematics that can affect wide - field and low - frequency polarised observations .",
    "there are a number of facilities designed for spectropolarimetry at other frequencies : askap will observe at frequencies between 700  mhz to 1.8  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , atca at @xmath6  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , galfacts between 1.2 to 1.5  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the jvla at @xmath71.2  ghz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and lofar at @xmath8230  mhz ( e.g. * ?",
    "the gmrt itself is currently undergoing an upgrade that will further improve upon its science capabilities @xcite .",
    "when the upgrade is complete , the intended nearly - seamless frequency coverage from 150  mhz to 1.5  ghz , with instantaneous bandwidths of 400  mhz , will be centred within a frequency range with limited complementary observational data .",
    "wide - field polarimetric surveys with the gmrt therefore have the potential to fill a crucial gap in our understanding of cosmic magnetic fields .    as a demonstration of the instrument s capabilities , we here present wide - field spectropolarimetric observations of two southern compact groups ( scgs ) made at 610  mhz with the gmrt .",
    "galaxy groups are some of the smallest and most dense associations of galaxies .",
    "these groups are gravitationally bound structures in various stages of dynamical evolution , from young and spiral - dominated to almost completely merged .",
    "they are amongst the best natural laboratories for investigating the evolution of the intragroup medium ( igm ) .",
    "it is known that mergers and less powerful interactions can be a significant contributor to heating of the igm via both supernova explosions and the triggering of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "these data show that it is possible to make wide - field spectropolarimetric observations with the gmrt at 610  mhz .",
    "note that @xcite present 610  mhz polarisation results from the gmrt using the bandwidth - averaged stokes @xmath9/@xmath10 observations .",
    "also , @xcite present other 610  mhz gmrt spectropolarimetric observations of the nearby galaxy m51 , which is depolarised below the sensitivity limit .",
    "sections  [ s : rms ] and [ s : gmrt ] present , respectively , background information related to the technique of rotation measure synthesis , and details of the gmrt polarisation observations , data reduction procedures , and a technical characterisation of the instrument s polarisation performance .",
    "the results for the case study observations of the two scgs are presented and discussed in section  [ s : groupgalaxies ] , and for other sources in the fields in section  [ s : nongroup ] , with conclusions presented in section  [ s : discussion ] . throughout this paper",

    "a key issue for polarimetry of astrophysical sources is removal of effects that alter the properties of the radiation as it propagates across the universe and through the various components of a radio telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "one such effect , faraday rotation , occurs as linearly polarised radiation travelling through a magnetised plasma undergoes birefringence .",
    "the linear polarisation can be considered as two counter - rotating circularly polarised components which experience different refractive indices . upon exiting the plasma ,",
    "faraday rotation will have caused the electric vector of the incoming linearly polarised wave to rotate .",
    "consider a simple model with just one source along the line of sight with no internal faraday rotation , and only a single slab of plasma existing between us and the source . in this case , the electric vector polarisation angle ( evpa ) will be rotated by an amount proportional to the squared wavelength of the radiation as described by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the observed evpa , @xmath21 is the intrinsic evpa at the source , and @xmath22 is the wavelength of the radiation .",
    "the factor of proportionality is known as the rotation measure ( rm ) .",
    "the measurement of rm allows magnetic fields oriented along the line of sight to be probed .",
    "the interpretation of rm measurements is complicated as faraday rotation occurs both within a source and in the intervening magnetised plasmas between us and the source .",
    "for example , faraday rotation from the interstellar medium of our own galaxy ( the ` galactic foreground ' ) corrupts the measurement of weak magnetic fields in extragalactic sources .",
    "in addition , faraday rotation in the earth s ionosphere further modifies polarised signals and inhibits polarisation calibration .",
    "the relationship between evpa and @xmath23 can be far more complicated than the simplified linear - dependence that equation [ evparotation ] suggests .",
    "many astronomical sources contain both non - thermal and thermal electron populations  leading to internal faraday rotation .",
    "furthermore , multiple faraday rotating regions may exist along the line of sight between us and a source .",
    "this can lead to a non - linear dependence between @xmath20 and @xmath23 , with the rm effectively becoming a function of wavelength .",
    "the separation of the differing wavelength - dependent contributions to the rm ( which exist at different faraday depths ) is essential to understand cosmic magnetism .",
    "the capabilities of modern correlators allow for a single observation to output a large number of frequency channels . in combination with the technique of rm synthesis , it is possible to separate these differing contributions to the rm , eliminate @xmath24 ambiguities , and maximise the sensitivity to polarised emission .",
    "the rm is defined as @xmath25 and now equation [ evparotation ] can be redefined with a factor of proportionality equal to the faraday depth , @xmath26 , so that @xmath27 where @xmath28 is generally the electron number density of the plasma and @xmath29 is the strength of the component of the magnetic field parallel to the line of sight .",
    "the constants @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the electronic charge , the mass of the electron , and the speed of electromagnetic radiation in a vacuum respectively .",
    "the integral from 0 to @xmath33 represents the distance along the line of sight between the observer and the source .",
    "now the rm is simply the slope of a @xmath20 versus @xmath23 plot , and @xmath26 is defined so that it can vary along the line of sight and such that a positive value implies a magnetic field pointing towards the observer .",
    "sources of radiation may now exist at different faraday depths along a line of sight .",
    "note that the faraday depth does not have a simple relation to physical depth .    to obtain the faraday depth from our observations ,",
    "we perform rm synthesis and obtain the peak in the deconvolved ` faraday dispersion function ' which describes the intrinsic polarisation at each faraday depth @xcite . in essence",
    ", the mathematical derivation of the rm synthesis technique allows for polarisation vectors that are close together in @xmath23-space to be fourier inverted into ` faraday space ' i.e.  @xmath26-space .",
    "the polarisation vectors are summed coherently at a number of trial faraday depths , with the sensitivity being maximised to polarised emission at that faraday depth . for a full description of the technique ,",

    "the gmrt data were compared with vla data from the 1.425  ghz atlas of the iras bright galaxy sample @xcite in order to retrieve the peak brightness and spectral index of sources .",
    "when the source was not available in the atlas , and when the s / n allowed , the gmrt data were instead combined with images from the sumss @xcite at 843  mhz .",
    "for comparison with the 1.425  ghz atlas data , the gmrt images were convolved to a resolution of @xmath39  arcsec . for sumss data ,",
    "gmrt images were reconvolved to @xmath40  arcsec@xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the declination of each observation @xcite .",

    "the scg catalogue consists of 121 groups over @xmath48% of the southern sky @xcite . the automated algorithm used to select the scg sample followed criteria that was similar to that used for the hickson s compact groups ( hcgs ) , which consists of many groups that are physically bound and in different stages of evolution @xcite .",
    "the scg catalogue avoids one of the biases of the hcg catalogue  as fainter galaxy members with a magnitude close to the cut - off limit were discarded by the eyeball search used for the identification of hcgs .",
    "the selection criteria for the scgs are based on richness , isolation , and compactness in order to identify groups in the blue plates of the cosmos survey @xcite .",
    "the groups observed in this paper , the grus quartet and uscg  s063 ( also known as scg  2315@xmath494241 and scg  0141@xmath493429 respectively ) , are both in ` phase 2 ' of their evolution , i.e.  with extended tidal tails and a perturbed gas distribution .",
    "they are observed with the gmrt at 610  mhz and used alongside sydney university molonglo sky survey data at 843  mhz , vla data at 1.425  ghz , and near infra - red data from the dss-2 survey .",
    "these data allow for constraints on the group members spectral index , polarisation fraction , and faraday depth . they also allow for identification of counterpart sources at other wavelengths , and act as a probe of tidal interactions or ram pressure from the igm compressing the magnetic field of the galaxies .",
    "tidal interactions and/or ram pressure stripping have been shown to occur frequently in compact groups , with @xmath50% of the galaxies showing signs of morphological disturbances . in a simple case",
    ", tidal interactions would lead to bridges and tails , ram pressure stripping would lead to a smooth swept - up morphology and displaced gas disks , while turbulent viscous stripping would lead to effects on the entire gas disk @xcite .",
    "it is likely that these hydrodynamical interactions play a substantial role in the evolution of group galaxies and their morphological type .",
    "several groups of galaxies have shown evidence for ram pressure like events shaping their morphology , with many member galaxies showing an hi deficiency , alongside the presence of massive hi structures in the igm .",
    "the presence and role played by the igm in the evolution of groups of galaxies therefore continues to be of interest ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "x - ray emission has been detected from the igm of several groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the detection rate being higher in the evolved elliptical dominated groups as compared to spiral - rich groups .",
    "however , as shown by , the member galaxies of the poor group holmberg 124 seem to show signatures attributable to ram pressure like events being experienced by the galactic interstellar medium . furthermore , cold hi gas has been detected between the member galaxies in several hickson s groups , which could enhance the density of the igm and lead to ram pressure like events playing a more significant role .",
    "nevertheless , due to observational difficulties and faint signatures , it has been difficult to rigorously determine the effect of the igm on the galaxies in groups .    another way to address",
    "this is to study the linearly polarised emission from the group members .",
    "polarised emission is , in principle , an ideal tracer of such interactions , and directly reveals regular magnetic fields that result from field compression due to interaction with the igm .",
    "previous attempts to understand these processes have been made both observationally and through three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations @xcite .",
    "such a study has been done for spiral members of the virgo cluster , with all the studied galaxies showing an asymmetric polarised intensity distribution along ridges in the outer part of each galaxy which differs from what is typically observed in field spiral galaxies .",
    "attributed the observed behaviour of these galaxies to interactions with the intracluster medium that are mediated by ram pressure . while @xcite found that tidal interactions and accreting gas envelopes can lead to compression and shear motions which enhance the polarised radio continuum emission . observing a large sample of galaxy groups in linear polarisation",
    "will therefore assist in further understanding the signatures of various processes that influence the radio emission .",
    "various properties of the galaxies in the target groups are summarised in table [ tab : groupinfo ] .",
    "the individual groups are discussed in further detail in sections [ group2 ] and [ group1 ] .      the grus quartet at a luminosity distance of 18.3  mpc and a velocity of 1571  km  s@xmath15 contains four galaxies , all of which are spirals as shown in fig .",

    "the non - thermal spectrum , polarisation properties , and radio morphology  particularly the bright outer hotspots  is typical of an fr - ii type , x - shaped radio galaxy with both a set of active lobes and wings .",
    "the gmrt has previously been used to study such objects @xcite .",
    "only @xmath164100 candidate sources at most have been identified to date , and even this is likely an overestimated sample that includes z- and s - shaped distortions that are common in fr - i sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a frequent explanation for the unusual morphology is that the central supermassive black hole underwent a recent realignment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the complementary sumss data does not have sufficient resolution to measure any spatial spectral index variations in this x - shaped galaxy .",
    "future observations could allow for the spectral index of the active and the winged lobes to be measured ",
    "the active lobes typically have @xmath165 and the wings @xmath166 , and the aged electron population can reveal which of the jets is from the more recent period of agn activity @xcite",
    ". nevertheless , the bright hotspots and coincident polarisation are typical of termination shocks as the jet fluid encounters approximately stationary lobe material  indicating that these are the active lobes .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to calibrate the gmrt s full - polarisation mode for the use of spectropolarimetry , in order to investigate some aspects of cosmic magnetism .",
    "in addition , our characterisation of the wide - field polarisation beam allows us to be confident of polarisation measurements within an appropriate portion of the fov .",
    "the application of rm synthesis to gmrt data requires consideration of a large number of systematics , including the instrumental polarisation , instrumental time - stability , quality of @xmath70-data calibration , ionospheric faraday rotation , polarisation angle corrections across the observing bandwidth , and the wide - field response .",
    "however , we have shown that all of these calibration issues can be addressed , resulting in a sensitivity of a few tens of @xmath0jy in faraday - space at 610  mhz .",
    "nevertheless , there are a number of limitations for gmrt polarisation data that restrict the instrument s current use for high - dynamic range polarimetric observations .",
    "the on - axis instrumental polarisation is both large and highly frequency - dependent at 610  mhz .",
    "the rapid wrapping of phase with frequency limits the quality of polarisation calibration .",
    "furthermore , the fact that some antennas have high leakage requires the use of a non - linear model in order to separate the source and instrumental polarisation .",
    "nevertheless , a full non - linearised model is not currently available in commonly used data reduction packages , ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for further detail ) .",
    "it has been possible to make progress with gmrt polarimetry by removing antennas with instrumental polarisation @xmath16715% , thereby eliminating antennas for which a small - leakage approximation breaks down .",
    "the loss of antennas that are located in the outer arms of the array frequently leaves significant gaps in the @xmath70-coverage .",
    "this requires tapering of the data in the @xmath70-plane , which reduces the highest resolution that is available .",
    "nevertheless , the major upgrade that is currently underway will essentially revolutionise gmrt polarimetry , as the better quality receivers that are currently being installed will likely have completely different polarisation properties .",
    "the gmrt has been used for both deep surveys at 610  mhz ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and large - area surveys such as the tifr gmrt sky survey ( tgss ) at 150  mhz .",
    "the tgss is planned to detect up to two million sources in total intensity at 150  mhz .",
    "the resolution and sensitivity of the gmrt at low radio frequencies means that polarimetric radio surveys have the potential to be complementary to planned surveys with facilities such as askap that explore a similar parameter space at higher frequencies and more southern declinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "future observations with the polarisation mode of the gmrt could make useful predictions of the number density of polarised sources observable with the ska and its pathfinders , and opens up the possibility to model magnetic fields and their evolution in populations of faint radio sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , it has been argued by that a combination of gmrt , lofar , and jvla data will allow for magnetic structures at intermediate scales to be recognised ",
    "comparable to the range of recognisable scales in faraday space for ska data .",
    "this would allow for much stronger constraints to be placed on the prevailing depolarisation mechanisms at low frequencies , allow for improved estimates of polarised source counts at low frequencies , and demonstrate the feasibility of using next - generation facilities , such as the ska , for observing the rm - grids that will be essential for understanding cosmic magnetism @xcite .",
